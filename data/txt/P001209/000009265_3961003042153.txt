MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMIEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMEN'k ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed credit to the Republic of CBte dlIvoire of SDR 4.7
million to help finance a Human Resources  Mgement prqect. The credit would be
granted on IDA terms with 35 years' maturity
2.          EQonic Setting. After a long period of sustained growth and extrnal
stability, the RCI economy experienced a deep crisis in the early 1980s, a crisis that was
prompted by a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade for its major exports coffee and
cocoa, combined with a slow internal adjustment to this worsened external environment.
The crisis relented somewhat in 1985/86, when the terms of trade improved temporarily.
However, since 1987, GDP growth has been negative on account of a renewed fall in the
terms of trade and the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate. GDP in 1992 was
10 pement lower than in 1986. Combined with the 3.8 percent growth in population, this
caused per capita income to fall by 27 percent between 1986 and 1992. External
indebtness rose sharply and the debt burden of the economy is very taxng (scheduled
debt service in 1992 was more than half the amounts of exports, while external debt
equals 1.6times GDP.) With a negative primary budget surplus untl 1991, RCI has been
unable to service its extemal and intemal debt, resulting in large amounts of outstanding
arears. The level of arrears has undermined extemal creditworthiness, required
substantal bank restucturing, and complicated the operations of the enterprise sector.
Public investment expenditures in recent years have fallen to 3 percent of GDP, clearly
inadequate to maintain the social and economic infrastrucure of the country, thereby
jeoring fute growth prospects.
3.          Policy Reaction. The policy reaction of the Government to this situation
has been a succession of austerity programs. In mid-1989, the Government launched a
stabilization program, supported by an 18-month IMP stand-by arrangement, approved
in November 1990, and by three World Bank financed SECALs in the agriculture,
energy, and water supply and sanitation sectors, which were approved between October
1989 and June 1990. A major focus of the stabilization program was to improve
budgetary results and reduce internal arrears so as to improve the pnvate sector's
liquidity and confidence. Major progress was achieved in implementng these reforms and
in reducing the fiscal deficit, which at the end of 1990 was at the level targeted by the
IM1 program. However, the 1990 stabilization program did not achieve a number of
important objectives, particulrly those related to the reduction of intema and extemal
arrears.
4.          Recognizng that a reinvigorated economy requires improved economic and
financial management and greater popular support, President Houphouet-Boigpy
introduced major political refonns starting in 1990. These culminated in the first multi-



Hum= Resour Managment Pjiect                                           2
party presidential and parliamentary elections in October and NovWmber and the
appointment, in December 1990, of a highly respected international economist as Prime
Minister. The ensuing reorganization of Government was wide ranging: the number of
ministries was reduced from 40 to 20. Moreover, the number of Government departments
was cut from 144 to 111.
5.         In mid-1991, the newly appointed Government adopted a new adjustment
program: the medium-term economic framework (MTF). It addresses the key medium-
term issues of competitiveness, including tax and regulatory r-form, financial sector
refom, privatization, human resource development and restructuring of public debt. The
MTF is designed to retun the RCI economy to a stable growth path of around 5 percent
p.a. by 1995/96, consistent with internal and external equilibria. The MTF is supported
by three Bank/IDA financed SECALs, approved between October and December 1991,
in support of reforms of the finarvcial sector and human resources sector as well as
reforms in the regulatory area. The 5rst tranches of these SECALs were disbursed upon
loan/credit effectiveness. While progress is being made towards meeting the specific
condictons for the release of the respective second tranches, the Govemment has as yet
to tk meas'lres to restore the country's overal competitiveness, another condition of
tranche release.
6.          As a key element of the MTF - which aims to assist C6te d'Ivoire to
regain its economic competitiveness -the Govemment's Human Resources Development
Progam (HRDP) aims to create an enabling policy environment for expanding access to
and quality of service delivery in education, health, vocational and professional training,
and population and labor market reform. The principal stategic objectives of the HRDP
are, first, to arrest the deterioration of the quality and coverage of services through
rationaliing the use of financial and human resources, and second, to take decisions on
a number of key issues that threaten the sustainability of service delivery, including
controling the growth of teacher salaries, controling university enrolment, restructuring
cost recovery for health services, and increasing resource allocations to the primary
sectors of educain and health and for non-salary costs. To execute the program, the
Government established an inteministeial operations committee (COP) under the general
supervision of the Prime Minister's Office, with active sub-oommittees in each of the
human resource ministries (National Education; Public Health and Social Security;
Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technical Education and Public Service and
Employment). The HRDP is being executed satisfactily. Government has launched
an ambitious program for university reform which will permit a better management of
students'careers. It has implemented measures which will progressively reduce the
teachers'wage bill and increase non-salary operating expenses. In addition, actions are
being finalized to begin reforming health care quality and financing and the 1993
education budget allows for growth in pedagogic expenditures relative to salaries and
administraion. Technical work focussing on meeting specific second tranche release
conditions has also progressed satisfactorily. However, while successfully launched, the
first years'experience revealed additional structural problems in the technical ministries
which the present project is designed to correct.

7.          Project Objetedves. This operation, which is a companion project to the
Economic Management Support Project ("PAGE-) which was recently presented to the
Board, is designed to improve the capacity of COte d'Ivoire's human resource ministries
to implement operational strategies under the HRDP by raising the level of minstry staff
skills in key areas. The overall strategic objective is to recruit high caliber expertise
with a commitment to on-the-job training and proven ability to transfer skills to nationals.
These objectives are a major element of the terms of reference for technical advisors to
be recruited. The Project would focus on two broad areas: (i) reinforcing work methods
and systems which now appear to be needed to further improve performance and quality
in planning, programming and budgeting, and in monitoring and evaluation (thus
complementing efforts being undertaken though the PAGE" at a central ministry level);
and (ii) strengthening the capacity to promote quality and increased access in education
and health, principally at the primary level.
8.          Project Descrion and Financing. The project would provide US$7.9
million for incremental short- and medium-term technical assistance and taining, and for
a complement of new equipment to assist the human resource ministries in establishing
adequate systems for (i) planning, programming and budgeting ($1.6 million) (Annex A,
pans. 7-12); and (ii) monitoring and evaluation of service delivery performance and the
impact of policies and programs ($0.5 million) (Annex A, paras 13-17), including
beneficiary assessments (Annex A, pan. 18). In addition, the Ptrect would assist the
ministry of National Education to launch a quality schools inifative with the aim of
promoting improvements in the quality of learning and management performance of
schools ($3.0 million) (Annex A, pas. 19-24). Lastly, operational support would be
provided for the COP to permit it to monitor the transfer of technology, which is the
basis of the project, and to conduct policy-driven pre-investment studies for the human
resources sectors ($2.8 million) (Annex A, paras. 28-31). An IDA Credit of
approximately US$6.7 million would finance 100% of foreign costs and 60% of local
costs, for a total of 85% of project costs. The Government would finance the remaining
15% of project cost. The Project would be executed over three years, which is a
sufficient time frame for this phase of development of the human resources ministries,
following an agreed implementation schedule (Schedule 5). Two PPFs awards for a total
of US$1.0 million have been made to ficilitate project start-up.
9.          Project Impemenion. The Project was prepared in large part by the
staff who will be responsible for its implementation (see Project Sustinability below) and
all terms of reference for the advisors to be recruited have been completed. Given this
participatory approach, each technical ministry would be responsible for worling with
its own consultants and trainers to improve its performance and to execute the studies and
pilot programs falling within its area of responsibility. As with the execution of the
HRDP, the COP would coordinate and harmonize these activities and funiish them with
logistical and contracting support. A part-time consultant would support the COP in its
efforts to monitor and provide timely feedback on the skills and training aspects of
technical assistance. The Permanent Secretary of the COP, supported in the area of
procurement of services, accounting and providing initial stocks of materials by the staff
of the DCGTx (the ucellule technique"), would be the overall Project Manager.

Maximum effort would be made toidentify and use loa and African consutants in te
areas f           amagement ad admiistration, ith the aim that these would become more
pemnent "resorces for the Administration. Project performance would be assessed
during annual reviews, for which perormace indicators have been agreed (Schedule 4).
10.        Projed Su. The staff of each key directote have been
primarily responsible for defining their assistance needs and for drafting detailed terms
of reference and work programs for technical support. These terms of reference clearly
exrs   the governmenlts desire to focus technical support on capacity building and in-
service trailnig and to assure long term committment to and susnability of projet
results. In the context of planning, programming and budgeting, and monitoring and
evaluaion, echnical worlkng groups within each ministry would be used as a vehicle to
faciiate the widest possible participation and dissemination of infomaon. The Project
and the adjustment operation which supports the HRDP would be mutually reinforcing,
with the aim of ensuring that the Government's reform process is susined. The Project
would be largely neutral with respect to the Government's recurent budget.
11.        Lessons from Pous Bank Involvement. IDA's previous expience
with technical assistance operations in Cote d'Ivoire has pointed up the need for a
paricipatory process, implicating at the design stage those Ivoirans ultimately
responsible for implementation and emphasizing long-term capacity building. The PCR
for the Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2059-IVC, 1981) concluded tha its cacity
building objectives failed, largely because of a lack of commitment to and inalization
of the adjustnent process by the Government. The PCR also reported that the project
failed to address long term institutional development issues. Building commitment and
ensuring interalization of a human resources reform program are primary objectives of
the HRDP. The Human Resources Management Project is designed to complement the
HRDP by focusing on capacity building and institutional development. The terms of
reference, which have been agreed, emphasize skills tansfer, training and building a
collaborative relationship between advisors and operational staff through the use of
working groups, workshops, seminars and routine communication procedures. Formal
criteria have also been developed with which to evaluate training and skills transfer
aspects of consultant work programs, and a consultant wodild be hired to monitor this
process. In addition, the use of periodic consultant visits and local expertise, where
possible, would help avoid the negative effects of employing long-tenn 'international
experts", while building local capacity and local sources of technical support.
12.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank Group's country strategy for
COte d'Ivoire is to assist the country to regain its international competitiveness as well
as to restore sustainable growth and creditworthiness. The Board last discussed this
strategy in detail in December 1991 when the Human Resources and the Regulatory
Reform SECALs were approved. Improving the quality and efficiency of service
delivery in the human resource sector is a major part of this effort. The Government and
the Bank have developed a productive working relationship in the area of human resource
development through dialogue culminating in a difficult adjustment operation. Ti
collaboration is likely to continue with further investment and adjustment operations.



Human Raoute Mandgezat Project 
The quality of this collaboration will increase once technical ministies are better
equipped to conduct the basic management functions that the Project would help to
develop. A Country Assistance Stategy discussion will be scheduled once C8te d'Ivoire
takes measures to restore its overall competitiveness, which is a condition of release of
the second tranches of the aforementioned SECALs. The Bank is particularly well placed
to reinforce the development of executive capacity in the administation, for which fte
Economic Management Project was recently proposed (Report P-6048-IVC) and in the
context of implementing the HRDP. This project is an integral part of the Bank's
strategy for assistance to CBte d'Ivoire.
13.        Agreed Actions. The project has been well-idendfied and prepared using
a participatory approach under the aegis of the COP. In addition to the standard
conditions of effectiveness, IDA and the Govemnment have agreed to the following
conditions of effectiveness with the aim of accelerating project implementation:
(a) selection through a competitive process of consultarts in support of the
plnning, programming and budgeting, and budget monitoring components
(see Annex A, para. 12);
(b) selection of the Technical Advisor for the Quality Schools Initiative
component (see Annex A, para. 24);
(c)   appointment of the Quality Schools Coordinator (see Annex A, para. 24);
(d)   selection of a Technical Advisor to the COP for technology transfer (see
Annex A, para. 29);
(e)   deposit of CFAF 75 million in a Project Account opened in a commercial
bank acceptable to IDA (see Annex A, parm. 41).
14.        Envimronmental Impact. The project does not present the prospect of any
detrimental environmental impact and, therefore, has been assigned a C-classification.
15.        Progrom Objectve Categotes. The project corresponds to the objectives
of the ACBI through both the building of executive and planning capacity in three
significant spending Ministries in C8te d'Ivoire, and its emphasis on the hiring of local
and other African consultants. It is also a major contributor to the quality of public
service delivery, which is conistent with the Bank's focus on reducing structural poverty
through human resources development. The technical assistance clasication of this
Project is Institutional Development Technical Assistance (IDTA).
16.         Project Benefits. The principal benefit of the project will be the capacity
it builds into the administration to promote better service delivery in education and health
at the level of schools and health facilities and amnong other actors in the central
Adminisaion.
17.         ProJect Rrs. The principal risk to the project would be the quality of
the advice and taining offered on one side, and the commitment of the Ivoirian

administration to put the achievements of the Project into use on the other. Contracts
vnth consultants and trainers would specify monitorable performance indicators and
Government would be expected to cancel the contracts of non-performers. Govermnent
has shown itself committed to reforming key functions of the administation of human
resources ministries, through the HRDP, and the Project would continue to be treated as
part of this process.
18.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

The overall performance of the C6te d'Ivoire portfolio is satisfatory, and there
are no major implementation issues. Disbursements have slowed owing to the lack of
countepwt funding, and disbursement under the second and third tranches of the three
FY92 SECALs are delayed pending completion of all of the respective second tranche
release conditions.
A Country Implementation Review is scheduled for June 1993.

Human Resourm Management Projec                                        14
SECTION A
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Part I: The Institutonal Setting
1.                The Human Resources Management Project would support the
implementtion of key parts of the Government's Human Resources Development
Program (HRDP), for which a Bank Loan of US$125 million (Ln. 2323-IVC) and an
IDA Credit of US$25 million (Cr. 3428-IVC) were approved on December 20, 1991.
Government met all conditions for effectiveness of the Program on January 8, 1992.
Subsequently, execution of the Program slowed owing to unexpected differences in the
capacities of the staffs of the central ministries (Finance and Plan) and the human
resource ministries in the areas of budget management. The Program has since regained
momentum following application of short term remedial actions. However, this
experience showed some structural wealmesses which the present project would attempt
to correct.
2.                Several mechanisms have already been established to facilitate
implementation and provide oversight and coordination of the HRDP. Day-to-day
responsiblity for implementing the program lies with HRDP Sub-Committees located in
each of the human resource technical ministries (the Mintry of National Education, the
-Ministry of Higher Education, Technical Education and Scientific Research, and the
Ministry of Health and Social Services). These Committees meet on a regular basis to
review progress under the program and to supervise and coordinate implementation. In
addition, interministerial coordination and supervision of the program is the responsibility
of an HRDP Operations Committee (COP) based in the Prime Minister's Office. This
Committee is made up of senior-level representatives from each of the Sub-Committees
located in the technical ministries, as well as the ministries of Finance and Employment
and Civil Service. The COP meets regularly to brief the Prime Minister's Office on
implementation progress and to decide on corrective measures when needed. The HRDP
Operations Committee is also responsible for donor coordination and for ensuring that
the human resources program remains consistent with prevailing macro-economic
conditions. The Operations Committee and the technical ministries are supported by a
Permanent Secreart whose basic personnel and operating costs are supported by the
Government.
3.                The Human Resources Mnagement Project would provide support
to key directorates in the human resources technical ministries as follows: the primary
focus of support for planning, programming and budgeting would be the respective
directorates of administration and financial affairs. However, because nearly all
ministerial departments have a role to play in the planning, programming and budgeting
function, technical assistance provided under the project would work closely with the
ministry as a whole. The directorates of planning and evaluation would be the primary
recipients of project support tar qualitative monitoring and evaluation. In the case of



Human Resourca Managment Project                                       15
higher education, which is composed of some eight semi-independent entities including
the university and the "grandes 6coles", support would be decentralized. The directorate
for primary education in the Ministry of National Education would be primarily
responsible for implementing the quality schools initiative. In view of technical support
currently being provided under the Health and Demographic Project (Ln. 2619-IVC),
support to the health sector would be limited to the Planning, Programming and
Budgeting and Monitoring and Evaluation components.
4.                The staff of each key directate have been primarily responsible
for defining their assistance needs and for draftng detailed terms of reference and work
programs for technical support.  These terms of reference clearly express the
government's desire to focus technical support on capacity building and in-service
tMining. They call for ministerial staff to be intimately involved, not only in the
implementation phase, but in the design phase of the management systems that will be
needed to implement and monitor the HRDP. In addition, particular emphasis would be
given to improving work methods and creating new information flow procedures. In the
context of planning, programming and budgeting, and monitoring and evaluation,
technical working groups within each ministry would be used as a vehicle to facilitate the
widest possible participation and dissemination of information. Broad institutional,
financial and political issues that exceed any one ministry's authority - such as the
adequacy of operating budgets, the degree of managerial autonomy, the politicization of
decision making, etc. - continue to be addressed under the HRDP. Responsibility for
all IDA-related implementaton matters pocurement, disbursements, coordination of
proect progress reporting, etc.) would lie with the Permanent Secreariat which serves
the HRDP Operations Committee (see Section B).
5.                A companion operation has been prpared and presented to the
Board, the Economic Management Support Project ("PAGE") which would support, inter
alia, the improvement of budgeting, programming and planning operations within the
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan. There would be close collaboration between
the managers of this project and the PAGE, who would both be in the same department.
Prt II: Project Components
6.                The Project consists of four components.  It supports the
Government's efforts already under way to strengthen thc capacity of the human resource
ministies to (a) prepare and defend operating and investment budgets which would
permit basic services to perform adequately; (b) monitor and evaluate service delivery
and the impact of policy actions as a basis for further strategic development; and (c)
promote quality improvements in instruction and school-management with the aim of
increasing student learning, the relevance of education and the cost-effectiveness of
service delivery. The Project would also provide (d) support for project management and
for monitoring the transfer of technology, as well as a pre-investment fund to finance
information collection and analysis and periodic studies to be identified. Detailed
descriptions of Project components follow.



Human Resources Managomat Project                                      16
1. Plannig, Progrmming and Budgeting
7.                Background and Objectves. The process of preparing operating
and investment budgets in the human resource technical ministries tends to be driven by
ad-hoc, administrative concerns at the expense of functional priorities. Experience has
shown that requests for additional resources on the part of the technical ministries are
made with little thought given to improving the effectiveness of existing resources or to
defining priorities for existing and new resources. For example, ministerial requests for
additional persnnel in the education and health sectors have been based on the presumed
needs of individual schools and health facilities without taking into account that schools
and health facilities in certain geographic areas are already over-staffed. Technical
ministry staff have also been unable to define standard operating norms and spending
prionities that would allow them to articulate the impact of various govemment actions
and seding options on the effectiveness of their services. Given the lack of technical
jusdfication for budget proposals and spending priorities, it is not surprising that the
technical ministries currently play a limited role during the budget arbitrage process.
8.                The objective of the Project in fte area of planning, programming
and budgeting would be to strengthen the capacity of the technical ministries to
participate constructively in the budget prepartion and arbitrage process. In order to
ensure the pay off of strengthening sectoral decision making and analysis, sectoral
budgetary reform will be coordinated closely with efforts underway in the context of the
conomic Management Support Project (PAGE) (currently under preparation) to reform
the central level budgeting process in the ministries of Finance and Planning. While the
pay off of budgetary reform at the sector level is to an extent dependent on the success
of cental level reform efforts, improving the decision malkng and analytical capacity of
sector personnel is a worthwhile goal regardless of progress at the macro level. The
HRDP would be the primary vehicle for ensuring that well-defined sector programs are
reflected in centrl level decision maldng.
9.         indicative budgetary programming models and operating norms were
developed as part of the HRDP preparation. The emphasis under the present Project
would be to refine and update these tools and facilitate their ialzatin by ministerial
staff charged with planning, programming and budgeting. Support would be provided
to strengthen the capacity of staff to (a) analyze current spending pattens - for both
operting and investment resources - with the aim of identifying efficiency gains; and
(b) prepare and defend operating and investment budgets on the basis of clear and
coherent spending priorities and the standard operating norms defined during preparation
of the HRDP. The development of the demonsation schools network, described below,
and the improvements in clinical practices and patient management norms for health, to
be financed under the Health and Demographic Project, would eventually contribute
information that would permit these management tools to be refined, particularly ir. the
are of establishing standard operating norms. The component would be considered a
success if, at the end of implementation, ministry staff were able to use new tools and
work methods to articulate their ministry's needs and demonstrate the budgetary
implicadons of fiscal decisions in a rational manner.

10.               Suppoil to the Technical Mlnistdes. The Project would provide
incremental medium term technical advice and in-service tining to all directorates and
semi-autonomous institutions (the university and the "grandes Ecoles") involved in the
planning, programming and budgeting process in the human resource ministries. Support
would include technical advice for (i) designing and using budgetary programming
models; (ii) establishing operating procedures, standard operating norms, and inter-
department and inter-ministerial information flow procedures; and (iii) improving work
methods. Technical support would also assist the technical ministries to monitor and
analyze the execution of annual budgets in the ministries concerned (see Monitoring and
Evaluation below).
11.               Technical advisors would be based in the directorates responsible
for administrative and financial affairs in each of the human resource ministries and
would work with other concerned directorates through intra-ministerial working groups
and training workshops. In the case of higher education, technical advisors would work
closely with personnel of the university and the "grandes 6coles". All conceptual work
for defining management tools, procedures, norms, etc. would be undertaken by these
working groups and carried out, to the extent possible, in group sessions. The technical
advisors would assume the role of work programmer and technical trainer for these
groups and workshops. This process would greatly facilitate internalization of the
various management tools and procedures, as well as facilitate communication and
information flows within the ministries. As previously stated, in order to facilitate the
adoption of well-defined sector programs, the technical advisors would coordinate their
work with central level budgetary reform efforts underway in the context of the PAGE.
Coordination with central level authorities is a clear performance criteria in the technical
advisors' terms of reference.
12.               The Project would provide: two technica advisors for the Higher
Education Ministry in the areas of budgetary programming and pedagogic standards; two
technical advisors to the National Education Ministry in the areas of budgetary
programming and personnel management; and one technical advisor to the Health and
Social Services Ministry in the area of budgetary programming. These technical advisors
would be hired for 18 person-months to be used over a three year period. The advisors
would begin their assignments with a 4-6 month sojourn in the technical ministries and
then schedule return visits lasting 1 or 2 months, 3 or 4 times per project year. In
addition, the project would provide funding for short-term advisors to the planning
directorate of the National Education Ministry in the areas of economic and sociological
analysis. The Health and Social Services Ministry has agreed to provide a health
economist to assist with the development of budgetary norms. The project would finance
computers, other office equipment and office supplies for key diectorates involved in the
planning, programming and budgeting process.
13.               Detailed terms of reference for these advisors/trainers have been
prerd by staff of the technical ministries in collaboration with a technical advisor
provided by the Bank. These terms of reference descibe in detail the technology
transfer objectives of the technical support, the status of initiatives currently under way

would need to be undertaken to strengthen and consolidate sector management in these
areas. In order to encourage participation and collaboration between the technical
advisors and staff in the respective technical ministries, the terms of reference describe
the working group process (see above), define criteria for evaluating the success of
capacity transfer, with which the advisor would be evaluated, and include a technical
profile which places emphasis on team building and training skills.
2. Budgetary Monitoring and Performance Evaluation
14.               Background and Objectives. A specific goal of the HRDP is that
the human resources ministries improve their capacity to monitor and evaluate service
delivery and use this information to improve their effectiveness. At present, little
emphasis or importance is placed on developing qualitative or quantitative criteria with
which to assess whether the government is achieving its ambitious development goals.
Some information is available on "inputs" provided for human resources development;
budgetary and personnel numbers are generally available, but these are poorly organized
and seldom analyzed in their global context. Actual spending figures are collected for
major expenditure categories, but they are not systematically monitored or analyzed in
the context of past budgets or used during the preparation of future budgets. Precise
information on the system's toutputs', or what is accomplished with public resources,
is also limited. While broad social indicators such as enrollment and health coverage
rates do exit, they are not generally assessed in relation to the government's goals and
priorities in the human resource sectors. Almost no information is available on the
effectiveness of service delivery at the school or health facility level and no criteria
currently exist for evaluating performance at this level. The Quality Schools Initiative
and beneficiary assessments for education and health (described below) would be the
primary vehicles for measuring the effectiveness of service delivery and recommending
remedial actions.
15.               In line with the goals of the HRDP, the objective of the Human
Resources Management Project would be to assist the technical ministries to develop and
implement monitoring and evaluation systems that would allow the government to
monitor its achievements in the human resources sectors and to use this information to
improve the performance of its service delivery. This component would be considered
a success if, after the end of project implementation, ministerial staff were routinely
using the tools and systems set up under the project to monitor the performance of the
sector at the school and health center level.
16.               Budgtwy Monitoing and Control. rTe technical advisers and
trainers described above in the context of planning, programming and budgeting (pas.
9-12) would also be responsible for assisting the technical ministries to monitor and
analyze the execution of their annual budgets. Because expenditure authority in C6te
d'Ivoire Is controlled to a large extent outside the purview of the technical ministries
(e.g. salaries, fellowships and other transfers which comprise in access of 90% of human



Humwn Resources Management Project                                     19
resource expenditures), monitoring the execution of budgets entails two separate tasks.
First, technical advisors would work to establish formal procedures for information flows
between the central ministries (Finance, Planning and Civil Service), the SACO (Service
Autonome Central d'Ordonnancement) and the technical ministries. The objective would
be that information on budget execution for all expenditure categories is made available
to decision makers in the technical ministries on a quarterly basis. Second, technical
advisors would work within the technical ministries to (i) improve their capacity to
provide timely feedback to decision makers, throughout a given budget year, on the
execution of that year's budget; (ii) analyze executed '-udget information in relation to
preparing future budgets; and (iii) monitor and analyze operating expenditures over which
the technical ministries have direct control. This task would involve developing close
working relationships between technical ministry accountants and their counterparts in
all semi-autonomous institutions that exercise a spending authority (such as the "grandes
&eoles", the university, hospitals and school inspectorates).
17.               The terms of reference for the advisors/trainers in the planning,
programming and budgeting section (para. 12) also describe in detail the objectives of
the technical support to be provided and the actions and measures that would be
undertaken to strengthen and consolidate the monitoring of budget execution. Similarly,
emphasis has been placed on encouraging participation and collaboration between the
technical advisor and ministerial staff through the use of working groups and workshops.
These objectives have been translated into experience profiles for the technical advisors,
which emphasize team-building and training skills, and into performance criteria for
evauating technical support.
18.               Perfonnance Evaluation. The development of quantitative criteia
with which to monitor and evaluate the internal efficiency of service delivery has been
assisted under separate initiatives in the education and health sectors. In health, the
Bank-financed Health and Demographic Project (Ln. 2619-IVC) is financing the
preparation of a management information system (MIS) which includes the definition of
performance indicators for all levels of the system - primary, secondary and hospital-
level health care. This ongoing work is summarized in the technical advisor's terms of
reference and specific mention is made of the need to coordinate efforts and to facilitate
the final conceptualization work and subsequent implementatioii of the health MIS in the
context of working group sessions and workshops foreseen under this Project. In
education, the development of quantitative indicators for performance evaluation at the
primary school level would be a major objective of the network of demonstation schools
described below. This initiative would be coordinated with efforts currently supported
by the French Cooperation to reorient and reorganize pedagogic support to primary
schools. The development of performance criteria for secondary education is currently
being addressed in the context of French support (PARMEN) to the Ministry of National
Education. In addition, Government has secured the assistance of Canada to further
develop a system for monitoring student achievement through standardized testing, as a
response to an engagement under the HRDP. These efforts are described in the technical
advisor's terms of reference and coordination - particularly in the context of institutional



Human Resources Mnagement Projct                                       20
internationalization of the use of these indicators - is an explicit objective of the
technical support
19.               In addition to developing the quantitative aspects of monitoring and
evaluation described above, the Project would provide support to develop the capacity
of the National Education and the Health and Social Services ministries to conduct
periodic beneficiary assessments. These assessments would include developing and
executing survey questionnaires for all groups participating in or directly benefiting from
the delivery of education and health services. These would include teachers, students,
parents, local or regional administrators, health care personnel and school and health
center.managers. The support provided would also emphasize the need to strengthen
central-level capacity to evaluate and publicize the results of these surveys and to
translate findings into further proposals for policy and regulatory reform. The terms of
reference for the technical advisors on beneficiary assessment would emphasize
technology transfer and their in-service training responsibilities, much like those
developed for budgetary programming and quantitative evaluation. The executing
agencies for beneficiary assessments would be the respective planning and evaluation
directorates of the two ministries concerned. The assessments would be conducted with
the collaboration of para-public and/or private local research institutions (such as
CIRES). The operating costs of the field survey teams would be provided by the
Government as part of its counterpart funding. The project would also finance computers
and other office equipment for the planning and evaluation directorates.
3. Quality Schools Initiative
20.               Background and Objectives. Promoting meaningful and replicable
improvements at the school-level requires both an enabling policy environment and a
consensus among education managers about what is happening in the schools and how
to go about the process of change. The HRDP program has made significant progress
in creating an enabling policy environment for education. However, there is, at present,
little shared understanding among public sector education specialists in Cote d'Ivoire
about what makes a good school and how to go about the process of improving the way
schools operate. Factors contributing to this lack of focus on the basic pedagogic mission
of schools include a heavy orientation in the system towards selection of superior
students, an administratively heavy and overly-centralized education ministry, poorly
trained administrative and technical staff and politicized decision maling, which serves
to focus attention on the entitlement aspects of the system. Given these factors, litde
reliable information exists in Cote d'Ivoire in the areas of student achievement, the
performance of teachers and school managers and the impact of education policy and
strategic interventions on schools, teachers and communities. Refocusing attention on
the quality of schools at the primary level is one of the main objectives of the HRDP
program.
21.               The objective of the Demonstration Schools Network is to assist
the Ministry of National Education to expand its capacity for promoting quality and



Human Resources Manage_Au  Poject                                      21
efficiency in the schools. The Demonstration Schools Network would create a
mechanism for capacity building and coordination in four important areas. First, it
would permit ministry personnel to develop new management practices and structures,
teaching methods and material resource combinations with the aim of identifying
replicable innovations at the primary school level. Examples of innovations which could
be introduced are decentralized teacher supervision and management systems, reorienting
and restucturing the role of school directors and inspectors and increasing the role of
communities in school management. Second, it would help ministry personnel establish
and monitor performance indicators and develop and refine school management and
spending norms. Third, it would provide a vehicle for cooperation and a constructive
exchange of views and information between various donor inituatives to provide
pedagogic support at the primary level. Fourth, it would encourage the participation of
teachers, school directors, inspetrs and parents in the process of improving education
and permit cental and nid-level ministry personnel to benefit from feedback on policies,
strat_es and programs from this level.
22.               It is important to emphasize that demonstrafion schools would not
be treated as "model schools". That is, they would not be provided with incremental
resources such as books, materials and advanced teacher skldls or numbers of teachers
that could not be replicated on a wider scale in the near term. Rather, the emphasis
would be put on experimenting with changes at the school level that do not imply an
important increase in recurrent spending. Demonstration schools, once established,
would eventualy be exected to be used for in-service taining.
23.        ITis component would be considered a success if, following the first two
years of implementation, the demonstration schools experience leads ministry staff to
adopt modifications to existing central policies and strategies which focus on teacher and
school quality. The HRDP Operations Committee (see sections on Institutional Setting
and Project Management) would be expressly responsible for ensuring that information
and policy options produced during implementation of the quality schools initiative are
effctively channelled into the policy fornulation process. As part of its mandate, the
COP would review findings under die initiative and describe in semi-annual reports the
steps it has tkn to ensure that new policy options are being considered and acted on.
The COP would also be responsible for ensuring a coordination of efforts and an
exchange of information with the French and German iniftatives in the area of pedagogic
support IDA supenriion missions wfll give close attention to this issue (see par  34).
Imrovements in the quality of leaming and the performance of individual schools should
be measurable in terms of exaam success rates and lower repetition and drop-out rates,
and ultimately student competencies.
24.               7he Demontation Schools Network. The Proect would provide
technical advisors and material support necessary to establish the Demonstration Schools
Network. Primary responsibility for planning, organizing and implementng the program
would be given to a School Improvement Commitee made up of seniof representoives
form the diectates of Primary Education, Planning, Evaluation and Statistics,
Pedagogy and Learning Materials, Human Resources and General Inspection. This



HNuma Resour Mana_met Prtoet                                          22
committee would report regularly to the National Education Ministry's HRDP Sub-
Committee, which would, in turn, brief the HRDP Operations Comnittee in the Prime
Mirnster's Office. The School Improvement Committee would also be responsible for
ensuring coordination between the DIemonstration Schools Network and the support
provided by the French Cooperation to reorient and reorganize primary-level
inspectorates. A full time Ivoiria Coordinator would support the School Improvement
Committee and coordinate day-to-day activities under the program over a period of three
years. The Coordinator would be supported by a full time technical advisor who would
provide substantive guidance to survey teams. Detailed terms of reference for this
position, to be agreed prior to negotiations, would emphasize training and team building
skills, as well as improving data collection capacity in the context of pedagogic
asserment.  The Project would provide the technical advisor and the School
Improvement Committee with vehicles, office equipment and materials, and incremental
operating costs for project start-up.
25.               The process of demonstration school identification and survey
design would provide a vehicle for consensus and capacity building for school-level
issues. As a first step, the School Improvement Committee would be responsible for
selecting and orienting school survey teams. The Committee would work closely with
quaified teams to identi schools to be surveyed and to propose and implement survey
designs. The MEN has agreed to organize a minimum of 10 survey teams and provide
theem with technical staff, such as audio-visual technicians and statisticians, as part of its
counterpart fuding. Because survey teams will be predominntly composed of public
sector employees, the salaries of these team members would also be considered
government counterpart funding.  Public employees will receive no additional
remuneration under the Project.
26.               The program is expected to begin with teams working in each of
the ten geographic regions in C8te d'Ivoire. The first nine months of the program would
be devoted to identifying local constraints, as well as innovative approaches to dealing
with them. This process would result after nine months in the actual selection of one
demonstration school per survey.  This process of identification of constraints,
innovations and demonstration schools where experimentation will be carried is designed
to give the School Improvement Committee, as well as IDA and other donors, the
opponunity to evaluate the capacity of the survey teams and to provide constructive
feedback where needed. The demonstration school network would expand to new schools
and districts depending on local capacity, resource availability and results obtained. The
School Improvement Committee would be responsible for ensunng *hat al activities -
survey team selection, school selection, survey design preparation and survey
implementation - are coordinated with the relevant regional and distict-level authorities.
In particular, inspetors in the chosen school districts would be an integral part of the
survey teams. School personnel would generally be selected for the program through a
combined nomination and interview process. Schools would ultimately be chosen based
on both the presence of innovative personnel and the existence of promising local
practices. The reward for school-level personnel involved in the program would be



Hun= Resource Magement Ptoject                                        23
professional enhancement; no monetary rewards would be offered. To the extent
possible, expmentation would build on local pcices.
27.               In support of the school survey/research teams, the Project would
finance subsistance, tansport costs, office equipment, materials and basic operating
expendiures. Costs per team would vary depending on geographic location and the
scope of the proposal. Based on public sector salary levels, government countrpar
funding has been estimated at approximately one third the cost of each survey team.
4. Mangemen Support and Pre-lnvestment Studies
28.               The Project would provide support to the COP for both Project
management and for facilitating the Government's supervision of the HRDP. This would
include office equipment and supplies for the technical secretariat of the COP and for
each of the thee sub-committees located in the technical ministries. Funding would also
be provided to the COP's technical support unit located in the DCGTx to allow it to
supPort project implementation - particularly in terms of procurement actions and
computer training -- and to monitor progress under the HRDP. A special advisor for
higher education policy will be funded for two years as support for implementation of
the HRDP program in the higher education sector. Retroactive financing for up to four
months would be provided for this assignment.
29.               Given the emphasis placed on skdlls transfer and training in each
,'f the Project components described above, special technical support would be provided
to help the Government monitor the transfer process between technical advisors and
ministry staff and provide feedback aimed at improving this process during the
implementation period. The Permanent Secretariat (see para. 31.) would be provided
with a consultant who would be charged with developing criteria with which to monitor
and evaluate the performance of the technical advisors hired under the project. The
consultant would work closely with the staff of the technical ministries to define
evaluation criteria and to provide periodic reports on the status of skldls transfer and
training to the Operations Committee and to the Bank. Terms of reference for this task
have been agreed with the government. The Project would finance logistical and office
support for the consultant.
-"J.              During the course of Project implementation, it is expected that
information needs and/or incremental development costs would be identified for which
timely investnent funding would be required. A pre-investment fund of US$1.5 million
would be established to ensure that information and investment needs to be identifed do
not hinder the timely and effective implementation of both the Project and the HRDP.
The monitoring and evaluation component and the demonstration schools network can be
expected to generate incremer.tal investment proposals. For example, applied research
caried out at the school-level may highlight the need to reorient and/or Testructure both
pre-service and in-service training for teachers, as well as in-service training for
inspectors and school dirtors.  Periodic support may be needed to finance tde



Hun= Resources Managenmt Project                                      24
development of new or revised training programs. The process of collecting data from
local facilities may also highlight the need for periodic support in the area of school
management.
31.               Proposals for financing under the pre-investment fund would be
coordinated by the HRDP's Operations Committee in collaboration with the technica;
ministies. All proposals would be vetted and assigned a priority by the COP, and would
subsequendy be submitted to the Bank for review and approval.
Part IM. Project Cost and Financing
32.               The Project's estimated cost over a three year period is US$7.9
miLlion. Price contingencies have not been included because of the short project period,
during which inflation rates are projected to be near zero in CMte d'Ivoire. Physical
contingencies have, likewise, not been added because the Project is of brief duration.
A detailed breakdown of costs is presented in Attachment 1. The average cost per
person-month of consultant services is US$13,000, which is in line with recent
experience in CMte d'Ivoire. A total of 204 person-months of senior technical advisors
are planned under the Project.
33.               An IDA Credit of approximately US$6.7 million would finance
100% of foreign costs and 60% of local costs incurred during the Project period, for a
total of 85 % of project costs. Two PPFs awards have been made for a total of US$1.0
million (PPF 770-0; PPF 770-1). These have pernitted Government to proceed with the
recruitment of key advisors and necessary equipment and operational support to assure
a timely start-up of project activities.

SECTION B
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND EMPLEMENTATION
Part I. Project Management
34.               While overall responsibility for coordinating and monitoring
Project execution would lie with the HRDP Opemtions Committee (COP), day-to-day
Project execution would be managed by the human resource ministries which would
benefit from its support. HRDP Sub-Committees established during preparation of the
human resources adjustment program have participated closely in identifying the support
needs of the technical ministries and in preparing the Project. These committees would
be charged with monitoring the work of the technical advisors hired under the Project;
technical advisors would prepare formal periodic reports for the Sub-Committees on the
status of their work. The Sub-Committees would make periodic reports to the HRDP
Operations Committee on Project progress. The HRDP Operations Committee, located
in the Prime Minister's Office and responsible for monitoring implementation of the
government's human resource adjustment program, would work through its Permanent
Secretariat to monitor the Project's progress and provide feedback as needed.
35.               The Pennanent Secrtariat established under the HRDP would
have responsibility for technical coordination and Bank-specific implementation matters
under the proposed project. The mandate and staffing of the Permanent Secretariat were
initially agreed with the Government during negotiations of the HRDP and would be
extended to cover coordination of the Human Resources Management Project. The
primary mandate of the Permanent Secretaiat is problem solving; its role is to act
quickly and effectively to facilitate project implementation and ensure that problems are
discussed and addressed in a timely manner. The Permanent Secretary is a senior official
of the Ministry of Economy and Finance who is authorized to communicate with the
Bank on behalf of the government. His primary responsibility in the context of the
Project is to ensure regular communication between the technical Sub-Committees and
the HRDP Operations Committee concerning issues of Project implementation. The
Permanent Secretariat would also be responsible for coordinating the work of the "skills
transfer and training" consultant, described in paragraph 26 above, and for ensuring that
progress reports focus to a large extent on the status of skills transfer and capacity
building efforts.
36.         The Secretariat is supported by a technical unit ("cellule technique")
located in the DCGTx which is responsible for (i) coordinating the recruitment and work
programs of all technical trainers to be hired under the project; (ii) managing the
procurement and distribution of office supplies and equipment for each project
component; and (ili) preparing semi-annual reports; the reports would set out the concrete
achievements made under the project and compare these to projected achievements for
the period and a calendar of actions for the next six months and the measures needed to
fulfill it. In order to avoid conflicts of responsibility that have existed in the pasi, it has
been made clear that the role of the Technical Unit will be solely to provide technical
support for the above-listed tasks; all decision maldng and spending authority will be



Human Resouroes Management Project                                    26
vested in the COP. The Project would provide operating support for the Technical Unit,
which will continue to provide the COP with technical expertise for supervsing
implemention of the HRDP.
37.        In addition to the semi-annual reporting mentioned above, IDA and the
Secretariat will undertake formal annual reviews of project progress. These reviews
would be expected to result in decisions concerning changes in project design and/or
implementation practices. Performance evaluation criteria, which focus on the attainment
of project objectives, are set out in Schedule 3. The Review would also cover the report
of the Specal Advisor for technology transfer and the latest semi-annual report of the
Secretariat conceng issues of procurement, disbursement and audits.
Part II. Procurement, Disbursement and Reporting
38.               Procurement. The qualifications and terms and conditions of
employment of all consultants would be satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with
Bank Group Guidelines for the use of consultants. Consultant seices would be
procured as follows:
fi)        for the execution of the Planning, Programming and Budgeting
Component and the Bulgetary Monitoring Component, a single local
competitive bidding org1 nized in three lots would be launched, leading to
ree contracts for up to 90 prson-months, to be used over three years;
sepaate contacts for six months each would be awarded for an economist
and a sociologist to support the MEN;
(ii)       for the execution of the Beneficiary Assessment Component, a short list
of suppliers would be invited to bid for a single contract for up to 24
person-mot.hs, to be used over three years;
(Iii)      for the execution of the Quality Schools Initiative, a short list of
recognized expers would be asked to submit offers for a long-term
resident consultant contract for 36 person-months; in addition, up to ten
contract per year would be awarded to survey teams, which would asist
with identification and cafry out implementation of the Demonstration
Schools Network following consultation with a short list of sources;
(Iv)        for the Mnagement Support and Pre-investnent Studies Componet, a
single contact for 18 person-months, to be used over a three year period,
would be awaded to an expert in technical transfer and taining on the
basis of individual consultations; a single contract for 24 person-months
would be awarded to a higher education policy advisor, who has Wready
been identified by Government; individual short-term contract of between
two and six person-months would be awarded over the course of project
execution following consultations with acceptable short lists of suppliers.

39.               Purchases of goods to be financedfrom the proposed credit are not
large enough to attract international competition. Contracts for office equipment,
computers and vehicles valued in excess of US$10,000 equivalent and up to a cumulve
total of US$400,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of local procuremnt
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Bidding documents for LCB will be prepared during
the first project year for both computers (and related equipment and software) and
vehicles. Technical staff supporting the Permanent Secretariat have had experience
defining procurement norms and specifications for computers and related equipment and
software. The Procurement of small items (office supplies and equipment, computers
and software not included in the initial procurement actions) estimated at less than
US$10,000 equivalent and up to a cumulative total of US$200,000 equivalent would be
carried out by shopping after obtaining quotations from no fewer than three eligible
suppliers. The treshold for IDA's prior review is set at the equivalent of US$30,000.
Procurement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B.
40.               Disbursement. The Project is expected to disburse over a thre-
year period. All eligible ependitures would be firnaced net of taxes. All disbursements
would be fully documented except for payments against contracts of less than US$20,000
equivalent where Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used. Direct payment
requests will be for no less than US$20,000 equivalent. The Permanent Secretarat
would be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications and SOEs to be submitted to
DA through the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), and would indicate on the
SOEs the naure and origin of any goods and the payment date. These would be retained
along with all other supporting documentation for review by Bank supvision missions
and independent auditors. There do not appear to be significant problems with Bank/IDA
disbursements in C6te d'Ivoire. Disbursement arrangements are summarzed in
Schedule B.
41.               Specal ad Project Accounts. To expedite implementation, the
Government would establish a Special Account at the CAA to be fianced with an initial
deposit of US$300,000 equivalent from the proposed credit upoil effectiveness. In
addition, in order to ensure the availability of Government counteipart fuiding, a Project
Account would be opened with an initial deposit of CFAF 75 million. The Project
Account would be opened and maintained in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA; the
Special Account would be replenished periodically on the basis of fully documented
reimbursement applications. No replenishments would be required for the Project
Account.
42.               Audtg. The Permanent Secretriat would maintain accounts to
record all Project expenditbres, commitments and reimbursements in accordance with
accepted accounting principles. Advance vntrxing arrangements for auditing services
would be made prior to Project effectiveness with independent auditors acceptable to
IDA. At negotiations, assurances would be obtained that Project financial accounts
would be audited annually, and that the audit reports would be sent to IDA no later than
six months after the close of the fiscal year. Overdue audits would be considered
grounds for suspension of disbursements under the credit.



Human Resoures Management Pject                                       28
43.               The Permanent Secretariat would be responsible for preparing
withdrawal applications and SOEs to be submitted to IDA by the CAA, and would
indicate on the SOEs the nature and origin of any goods and the payment date. These
would be retained along with aUl other supporting documentation for review by Bank
supervision missions and independent auditors. In addition, the Permanent Secretariat
would maintain accounts to record all project expenditures, commitments and
reimbursements in accordance with accepted accounting principles. At negotiations,
assurances would be obtained that project financial accounts would be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and that the audit reports would be sent to
IDA no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year. Advance auditing
arangements will be assessed at appraisal. Overdue audits would be considered grounds
for suspension of disbursements under the credit.
44.               Reporling and Monitodng. The Permanent Secretariat would be
responsible for submitting to IlDA through ;he COP (i) brief but substantive quarterly

SCHEDULE I
T ICAL ANNEX
TRANG ANDILTRANSE R
1.                 The primary objective of the Human Resources Management
Project is to improve the capacity of human resource ministries to implement the
Government's ambitious adjustment program on a timely basis. The strategy adopted is
to recruit high caliber expertise with a commitment to on-the-job trning and the ability
to transfer skills wd knowledge to nationals. These objectives are a major focus of the
consultant terms of reference already drafed for technical advisors to be recruited under
the Project.  To ensure that training and skills transfer receive priority during
implementation, several important actions have been taken:
(a)    The consultant profiles developed for all technical advisor posts
emphasize the importance of training, team building and
communications skills. These criteria would be weighted heavily
during the consultant selection process.
(b)   All terms of reference for consultant support outline a proposed
process of interaction between technical expet and ministerial
staff. The technical advisors would be required to mteract with
ministry personnel in a "working group' format, in order to
encourage partcipation and dissemination of information. The
technical advisors would be responsible for organizing workshops
in which staff from different ministerial offices and from outside
agencies discuss their objectives and strategies and seminars in
which ministry staff would present the results of their work to the
ministry as a whole.
(c)    All terms of reference call for the consultant to produce a work
program at the beginning of his or her assignment, to be updated
annually, in which he or she specificizes tWaining and sldlls
transfer strategies for the coming year and a strategy and timetable
for the implementation of these objectives. These work programs
would be updated after the first year based on results achieved.
Department Heads in each technical ministry would be made
responsible for results in terms of technical transfer and training.
(d)   All wms of reference include criteria for evaluating the work of
technical advisors which place heavy emphasis on achieving
training and slls transfer objectives.



Huma= Reors Manageenit Projec                                        30
(e)   Consultant support would be provided to the Government (to be
managed by the HRDP Operations Committee) to monitor training
and skills tansfer implementation and to provide periodic
feedback to technical advisors on how to improve this aspect of
their assignment.
2.                Because of the emphasis placed on developing and implementing
management tools and information flow procedures and on improving work methods and
practices, on-the-job training is clearly better suited to achieving the Project's capacity
building objectives. Nearly all training under the Human Resources Management Project
would be provided on-the-job through the use of working groups that meet regularly.
Workshops and seminars would also be organized to facilitate inter-office communication
and the dissemination of information.
3.                Periodic training needs may be identified during Project
implementation that the technical advisors do not have the time or expertis to fulfill.
In particular, training needs, as yet unspecified, are likely to be identified during
implementation of the Demonstration Schools Network, as well as during implementation
of a Patent Care Practices and Norms Initive, carried out under t1.e Bank-finanoed
Health and Demographic Prqject. To cover this eventuality, training and other staff
development needs would receive a high prority during the process of allocatng funds
under the Project Management and Pro-investment Component. To ensure the practical-
orientation and relevance of training, the Pre-investment Fund would only finance short-
term technical trainers who would provide on-the-job training in the human resources
ministrie or short-term training for precise slklls in Abidjan. No exterior training
outside C6te d'Ivoire is envisaged.
4.                Arrangement would be made under the planning, programming and
budgetng component to train key personnel in each human resource mistry in the use
of relevant software, and to provide trouble-shooting support throughout the project
period. This training would be conducted in the context of group sessions within each
ministry.
5.                The training aspects of this Project would be considered a success
if, at the end of Project implementation, ministry staff were able to use new tools,
information and work methods to articulate their ministry's needs and justify their
ministry's decision making process, particularly in the context of requests for operating
and investment resources.
