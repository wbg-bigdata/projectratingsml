About The Panel
The Inspection Panel was created in September 1993 by the Board of Executive Directors of
the World Bank to serve as an independent mechanism to ensure accountability in Bank
operations with respect to its policies and procedures. The Inspection Panel is an instrument
for groups of two or more private citizens who believe that they or their interests have been
or could be harmed by Bank-financed activities to present their concerns through a Request
for Inspection. In short, the Panel provides a link between the Bank and the people who are
likely to be affected by the projects it finances.


Members of the Panel are selected "on the basis of their ability to deal thoroughly and fairly
with the request brought to them, their integrity and their independence from the Bank's
Management, and their exposure to developmental issues and to living conditions in
developing countries."1 The three-member Panel is empowered, subject to Board approval,
to investigate problems that are alleged to have arisen as a result of the Bank having
ignored its own operating policies and procedures.

Processing Requests

After the Panel receives a Request for Inspection it is processed as follows:

· The Panel decides whether the Request is prima facie not barred from Panel
    consideration.
· The Panel registers the Request--a purely administrative procedure.
· The Panel sends the Request to Bank Management, which has 21 working days to
    respond to the allegations of the Requesters.
· The Panel then conducts a short 21 working-day assessment to determine the eligibility
    of the Requesters and the Request.
· If the Panel does not recommend an investigation, and the Board of Executive Directors
    accepts that recommendation, the case is considered closed. The Board, however, may
    approve an investigation against the Panel's recommendation if it so warrants.
· Three days after the Board decides on whether or not an investigation should be carried
    out, the Panel's Report (including the Request for Inspection and Management's
    Response) is publicly available at the Bank's Info Shop and the respective Bank
    Country Office.
· If the Panel recommends an investigation, and the Board approves it, the Panel
    undertakes a full investigation, which is not time-bound.

                                                                                             i

· When the Panel completes an investigation, it sends its findings and conclusions on the
  matters alleged in the Request for Inspection to the Board as well as to Bank
  Management.
· The Bank Management then has six weeks to submit its recommendations to the Board
  on what actions the Bank would take in response to the Panel's findings and
  conclusions.
· The Board then takes the final decision on what should be done based on the Panel's
  findings and the Bank Management's recommendations.
· Three days after the Board's decision, the Panel's Report and Management's
  Recommendation are publicly available through the Bank's Info Shop and the
  respective Country Office.

Executive Summary

                                  INTRODUCTION

On April 20, 2004, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection ("the
Request") alleging that the World Bank violated its own policies and procedures in the
design, appraisal and implementation of the Colombia: Cartagena Water Supply,
Sewerage and Environmental Management Project ("the Project"). The Request claimed
that the violations caused and will cause harm to the communities living in areas north of
the city of Cartagena and to human health and the environment. The Panel registered the
Request on April 22, 2004, and notified the World Bank Board of Executive Directors
("the Board") and the President of its receipt.

The Corporación Cartagena Honesta (CCH), a local non-governmental organization,
submitted the Request on its own behalf and on behalf of 125 residents of Punta Canoa,
139 residents of Arroyo de Piedra, 41 residents of Manzanillo del Mar, and 119 residents
of Cartagena.

The Project provides for the disposal of Cartagena municipal wastes by a submarine
outfall located about 20 km north of Cartagena, near Punta Canoa and the other villages
who have made the Request to the Panel. The proposed waste disposal system consists of
a 23.85km main wastewater conveyance system by land pipeline, a plant for preliminary
treatment of the wastes at Punta Canoa, and a submarine outfall for the disposal of the
wastes 2.85km off the coast of Punta Canoa at a depth of 20 meters.

After the construction period ­estimated as five years (1999-2004) at the time of PAD
preparation­ the operation of the outfall is to be implemented in two phases: Phase 1
(2005-2015) and Phase 2 (2015-2025). The first phase, which is part of the Bank-
financed Project, includes construction of the pumping station, the land conveyance
system, the preliminary treatment installation and the submarine outfall. During the
second phase the preliminary treatment plant must be upgraded to primary treatment or
the equivalent. CARDIQUE, the Regional Environmental Authority, imposed this
requirement when it issued the environmental license for the Project in June 2001 and it
modifies the original design of the system.

The Requesters claim that the proposed submarine outfall for the disposal of Cartagena
municipal wastes will pollute the marine environment and cause harm to their health and
economic well-being, because "untreated" wastewater will be discharged into the marine
environment. The sea supports fisheries. Fisheries and tourism are the primary sources of
income for the local people who live near the submarine outfall.

The Requesters challenge the adequacy of the documents supporting the Project, in
particular the Feasibility Study and the Environmental Assessment. They claim that the
studies' analysis of alternatives dismissed more environmentally and economically viable
options than the submarine outfall, and did not adequately take into account the sensitive



                                             ix

geological conditions of the area where the outfall and the conveyance system are to be
constructed in contravention of OD 4.01. Moreover, they claim that the Bank did not
comply with OP/BP 10.04 (Economic Evaluations on Investment Operations) because it
did not adequately evaluate the economic costs and environmental risks associated with
the outfall or the alternative options for disposing of wastes. They also claim that the
Bank did not comply with OD 4.15 on Poverty Reduction.

The Requesters believe that the social and economic effects of the Project were
considered only in a cursory fashion and that the consultation process was inadequate
because the people's concerns were not taken into account. They are concerned that they
will receive few benefits from the Project but will bear most of the risks and heavy costs,
both now and in the future.

They allege that the Bank violated the policy on Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) because
the Project failed to identify the affected communities living in Punta Canoa, Arroyo de
Piedra, and Manzanillo del Mar as indigenous peoples, and thus failed to prepare an
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP).

According to the Request, the Project could also harm people because of the potential
fiscal instability of the Borrower and the expected increase in the total cost of the Project,
which could cause the Borrower to default on the loan. This would violate OP/BP 10.02
on Financial Management.

Management submitted its Response to the Request for Inspection on May 21, 2004.

The Response states that the Bank complied with its policies and procedures. According
to the Response, the Project Feasibility Study addressed a comprehensive set of
alternatives, and the Environmental Assessment's analysis of the impacts of the Project
indicated that the design of the submarine outfall would minimize the risk that the
effluent would have harmful effects on the coastal zone, including in the area of the
Requesters, all in compliance with OD 4.01. The Response further states that the people
living in the North Zone (the Requesters) do not meet the criteria of OD 4.20 for
indigenous people, that they were consulted during Project preparation, and that they will
benefit from the Project , in compliance with OD 4.15 (Poverty Reduction).

The Response asserts that the Bank has complied with OP10.02 on financial management
of the Project, both in Project preparation and supervision. Moreover, Management
maintains that the cost benefit analysis conducted by Bank staff and a local consulting
firm, and the cost effectiveness analysis carried out by Hazen & Sawyer comply with OP
10.04 on Economic Evaluation of Investment Operations. The Response claims that
supervision of the Project has been thorough and complies with OD 13.05 and OP/BP
13.05.

To determine the eligibility of the Request and the Requesters the Panel visited the
Project area and met with the Requesters and other people in affected communities,
representatives of ACUACAR, national, regional and local government officials, local



                                             x

NGOs, technical experts and prominent citizens of Cartagena. The Panel determined that
the Request and the Requesters met the eligibility criteria set forth in the Resolution that
established the Inspection Panel and recommended that an investigation be conducted.
The Board of Executive Director approved the Panel's recommendation on July 13, 2004.

This report concludes the Panel's investigation into the matters alleged in the Request for
Inspection. The Panel's current chairperson, Ms. Edith Brown Weiss and Panel member
Tongroj Onchan led the investigation. Six expert consultants on environmental
assessment, water resources, submarine outfalls, social, economic and financial issues
assisted the Panel in the investigation.

This report examines the merits of the claims presented in the Request and
Management's Response to the claims. During its investigation the Panel team
interviewed Bank management and staff, visited the Project area, met with the Requesters
and other Project affected people throughout the area, met with local and national
authorities in Colombia, with ACUACAR officials and with other relevant experts. The
Panel also identified and reviewed relevant Project documents that the Requesters, Bank
staff, ACUACAR officials and other sources provided to the Panel.

With respect to the Project, the Panel assessed whether the Bank complied with the
following applicable operational policies and procedures:

The total cost of the Colombia: Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental
Management Project is, according to Management, US$117.2 million. On December 10,
1999, the Bank entered into a Loan Agreement with the Distrito Turístico y Cultural de
Cartagena de Indias providing for a US$85 million loan to finance about 72% of the total
Project cost. In addition to the IBRD Loan, the Project's financing structure includes
US$7.58 million from the Borrower, US$4.6 million from ACUACAR, the Project's
implementing agency, and US$20 million from the Government of Colombia, the
guarantor of the Loan. The Loan is scheduled to close on June 30, 2005, unless extended.


                                         Context

The Panel notes the urgent need for Cartagena to have in place a sustainable system for
disposing of its wastes. This is especially essential when the population of the city is
growing rapidly. Submarine outfalls are an established method for disposing of municipal



                                            xi

sewage and organic wastes. The choice of the submarine outfall as the preferred method
for disposing of wastes takes place, however, in the context of growing global concern
about the pollution of the marine environment. While submarine outfalls have long
served as a method for disposing of land-based wastes, there is increasing attention to
ensuring that the wastes are properly treated before discharge into the oceans and
released at sufficient distance and depth to protect against harm to the marine
environment or nearby coastal areas. Moreover, as the need grows for disposing of
wastes, there is increasing attention to methods for disposing of land-based wastes other
than in the marine environment.

In the Project before us, the Panel takes note of the very significant efforts by
Management and staff in the preparation and initial supervision to ensure that the Project
is appropriately designed and implemented. The Panel hopes that its Report will be of
value in assessing Bank's compliance with its policies and procedures and in furthering
the development of a sustainable and equitable waste disposal system.

Project to category A under OD 4.01. The Panel finds this to be appropriate and in
compliance with OD 4.01.

                                  Stage in Project Cycle

The Panel finds that the Environmental Assessment was initiated early in the
project cycle and in this respect complied with OD 4.01.

                                 Analysis of Alternatives

OD 4.01 requires that an Environmental Assessment analyze alternatives to those
proposed in the Project.

The Panel finds that the study of alternatives covered most of the alternatives for
this type of project and evaluated the basic parameters. In this respect, the Panel
finds the Bank in compliance with OD 4.01, paragraph 4 and Annex B (f). However,



                                            xii

the Panel is concerned about the diligence with which alternatives other than the
preferred alternative of a submarine outfall were studied. The voluminous
feasibility study and the environmental assessment, which closely follows the
feasibility study, give greater attention to the submarine outfall than to other
options. They do not demonstrate a systematic comparative study of all the
alternatives as required by OD 4.01. The Panel could find only cursory consideration
of the option of constructing a sewage treatment plant near Cartagena, with the treated
waters going to a marine area or alternatively used for agriculture as a supplement to the
recommended disposal system.

The Bank required that a Panel of Experts be appointed to review the technical quality of
the Project and to determine the cost-effectiveness of the proposed outfall design. The
Panel finds that the appointment of a panel of experts to review the technical work
in the feasibility study and the design of the Project is consistent with Bank policies,
particularly OD 4.01 Para. 13, but is not convinced that there was a sufficiently
thorough analysis of alternatives before a decision on the outfall was made.

                          Selected Option: Submarine Outfall

The Panel notes that disposal of sewage to sea via a submarine outfall is a tried and
proven technology which, under suitable conditions, offers a low-cost low-
maintenance solution for acceptable disposal of human wastes.

The Panel observes that the Feasibility Study and the Environmental Assessment
did not address the possible long term environmental and health effects on the
coastal and marine environment in the area if there were to be multiple outfalls in
the area and the volume of sewage and organic wastes increased significantly so as
to exceed the absorptive capacity of the marine area. This is an issue that may need
to be addressed in the future.

                      Punta Canoa as the Location for the Outfall

The submarine outfall is to be located 2.85 km offshore from Punta Canoa, which is 20
km north of Cartagena. The Panel notes that in terms of assimilative capacity the
Punta Canoa coastal waters could be a suitable site for an outfall, if necessary
precautionary measures are taken in the design to ensure proper dilution of the
effluent so that nutrients are at an acceptable level, and to ensure decay of
pathogens to a level safe for human contact.


                       Proposed Design of the Submarine Outfall

Bank Management relied on a robust two dimensional model to assess risk of
contamination near shore from the outfall and used actual field data taken over an
extended period of time. The Panel notes that while the necessary ocean modeling
studies were conducted, the methodology used did not capture the possibly
important influence of the wind on near surface currents in a stratified water



                                           xiii

column. This influence could affect the assessments of the dilution of effluent and
hence the risks of contamination to the marine and coastal environments.
Preliminary calculations by the Panel's outfall expert suggest that by not adequately
considering the near surface stratification and by being overly optimistic about the rate of
decay of pathogens, the far field analysis may not be reliable. The Panel notes that
according to the Panel's expert's preliminarycalculation, the proposed outfall design may
not achieve safe disposal of the effluent and meet safe pathogen standards close to 75%
of the time.

The Panel finds that if a three-dimensional model, rather than two dimensional,
were used to assess risk, the diffusion patterns and estimates of shoreline
concentrations might be different and that greater certainty regarding the risk
could be secured. The results could affect the distance from shore and the depth
required for safe disposal of the Cartagena wastes.

With respect to the selection of pipe materials, the Inspection Panel was variously
informed that: (1) both on-shore and submarine portions of the pipeline would consist of
reinforced concrete pipes; (2) that the on-shore pipes would be reinforced concrete but
that no decision had yet been made with respect to the submarine pipes; (3) that selection
of pipe materials is at the discretion of contractors bidding for the work and has yet to be
decided. The Panel notes that after a first bidding process that resulted in costs
much higher than those estimated in the PAD and the Engineer's cost estimate, new
specifications are being prepared calling for the use of High Density Polyethylene
(HDPE) for the construction of the outfall. According to Management, this alternative
should result in lower costs because, unlike reinforced concrete pipes, HDPE pipes would
not have to be trenched in the bottom of the sea over all its length but only in the surf
zone.

The Panel notes that HDPE pipes are a proven technology and widely used for pipelines
carrying water and sewage. While HDPE pipes have certain advantages, the Panel's
experts have expressed some concerns about the proposed solution, because these HDPE
pipes have until recently been of fairly small diameter. Also, the pipe would have to be
well anchored onto the sea floor as both a pipe of this diameter and the effluent it carries
would have a density less than sea water, making the pipes buoyant in sea water. By not
burying the pipeline there could be a danger that it will scour over certain span lengths
and this could lead to pipe ruptures. Pipe scour is a well known phenomenon in the gas
industry. Whether a pipeline will scour and hang free depends on the soil material, the
ocean current regime and the periodicity of the currents. The Panel hopes that proper
design and specifications will be able to deal with all of these issues.


                                     Risk of Diapirism

Diapirism (or mud volcanism) is the upward-and sometimes sideward-movement of less
dense sediments through denser materials due to buoyancy forces. The occurrence of
surface extrusion of mudflows in the vicinity of Punta Canoa is well known. The Bank



                                             xiv

investigated this by commissioning a geophysical study and by seeking the opinion of an
authority on diapirism in the proposed Punta Canoa location.

The geophysical investigation identified a diapiric feature of approximately 250m
diameter about 300m southwest of the proposed pipeline route. Recent historical records
document another diapirism feature in the area. Eye witness accounts cite a diapirism
event in 1979 off the coast of Punta Canoa.

The Panel notes that the expert study cited in World Bank documents found no evidence
that diapirism vents are located at the proposed Punta Canoa site, and the detailed
bathymetry survey did not show submerged mounds in the bathymetry. The Panel finds
that the potential for the pipeline to be ruptured or otherwise significantly disturbed
by diapirism appears to be low. However, given that the study found diapirism about
300 meters from the proposed outfall, it may be reassuring to clarify what distance is "a
safe distance" from the mud volcanism. The Panel notes that a side scan sonar survey
of the surface of an area of 25 km was done as part of the Geophysical
Investigations. It may be useful to have a side scan sonar survey of the proposed
outfall trajectory to map the subsurface soil structure to a depth of low frequency
sonar penetration in order to reduce any remaining uncertainty regarding the
possibility of a diapirism extending to the outfall, and to publish the results.

                               Land Conveyance System:
              Routing, Pumping Stations and Treatment Plant Locations

                                Evaluation of Alternatives

The environmental assessment identified and evaluated four different overland routes for
the pipeline and various alternatives at the Paraíso pumping station and the treatment
works near Punta Canoa. The Panel finds that for the selected option of a submarine
outfall, the analysis of the alternatives for the land conveyance systems, liquid
disposal location and pipeline corridors, in terms of their potential health and
environmental impacts, meets the OD 4.01 requirement that alternatives be
considered. Bank staff have exercised due diligence in considering alternatives and
mitigation measures and have complied with OD 4.01 on Environmental
Assessment.

                                 Overland Pipeline Design

There will be one 72 inch in diameter pipeline to convey the wastes from the Paraíso
pumping station in Cartagena over land to the submarine outfall. The wastes will be
pumped through the pipeline to the preliminary treatment plant at Punta Canoa and
thereafter flow by gravity to the sea. The Panel notes that a land pipeline conveying the
waste to Punta Canoa and thence to the marine area is subject to the risk of rupture,
intentional or accidental, and to other disabling events, such as disruptions of electrical
service. The contingency manual presents a review of these risks and the ways to deal
with each of them. However, after reviewing the contingency manual, the Panel



                                            xv

remains concerned about the adequacy of the planning for emergencies. The records
examined by the Panel do not clarify whether the Paraíso pumping station system
provides for a storage area in case of emergencies. The Panel notes that in case of
operation failure because of lack of energy or other potential problems along the land
conveyance system, the waste will flow to the Ciénaga de la Virgen unless there is a
storage area and this may affect the odor in the neighborhoods where the Paraíso Station
is located. The Panel notes that the Panel of Experts and the Environmental Assessment
emphasized the importance of a storage area for the wastes during periods when the
pipeline fails to operate or is taken out of commission.

The Panel also notes that two pipelines 72 inch in diameter were originally considered so
as to handle disruptions to waste transport in one pipeline. This appears to have been
abandoned for reasons of cost.

The Panel also observes that waste leakage from the pipeline could contaminate both
surface and ground water. The Panel finds that this issue was neither analyzed in the
1999 EA nor included in the Environment Management Plan. The Panel finds that
ground water monitoring is important in order to identify leakage and actions to
mitigate it.

                                      Disposal of Sludge

The Panel finds that the Project environmental studies did not consider alternatives
for the disposal of the solids recovered during the preliminary treatment of the
sewage stream. In this respect, Management was not in compliance with OD 4.01.
The Panel further notes that although Management now asserts that a plan exists
for the disposal of sludge, the Panel has not been able to find a consideration of
alternatives for the disposal of sludge as required by Bank policies before finalizing
a plan.

                                  The Monitoring Program


The Panel reviewed monitoring reports of several hundred pages prepared by
ACUACAR to establish initial baseline data for water quality in the Ciénaga and along
the coast up to Punta Canoa. The Panel finds that the Bank in requiring an adequate
monitoring plan with adequate baseline data has complied with the provisions of
OD 4.01. The Panel also notes that ACUACAR, as of summer 2003, had prepared
baseline data regarding fisheries in the area. The Panel again finds this to be in
compliance with OD 4.01. In both cases the baseline data should provide a reasonable
basis for evaluating the effects of the submarine outfall. The Panel notes, however, that
it is essential that these studies be periodically updated to maintain their relevance
and to identify changes in water quality or in fisheries.

                  Project Impacts on Locally Affected Communities


The Panel observes that while the outfall was designed so as to minimize the impacts of
waste water discharged in the sea, it is likely that the fishing conditions will change as a
result. The Panel finds that in Project preparation the Project's potential effects on
fishing were not adequately addressed. The Panel examined the Project records but
did not find adequate social evaluation and mitigation proposals of these potential
impacts on the local population's lives and livelihood. The Panel finds that this did
not comply with OD 4.01.

                    Compliance with OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats

Although item (ii) of Project component G on Restoration and Conservation of the
Ciénaga de la Virgen Natural Reserve has yet to be implemented (because the
Project has not yet advanced to a stage where this is applicable) the Panel finds that
the Bank is otherwise in compliance with OP 4.04.

                             Water Resource Management

The Panel finds that the decision to disregard the Ciénaga of Tesca as a potential
place for the final disposal of the waste after treatment allows for the preservation
of an important ecosystem. The Panel also finds that the Feasibility Study, the
Environmental Assessment, and supplementary studies document well and analyze
the condition of the biophysical environment, particularly of the Caribbean Sea,
Bahia de Cartagena and the Ciénaga de la Virgen. However, they do not consider
the terrestrial environment in as great a depth.

The Panel finds that the Bank is in compliance with OD 4.07 on Water Resources
Management and with OD 4.01 which requires that "water resources management
should be environmentally sustainable."


                              SOCIAL COMPLIANCE

                                   Indigenous Peoples

The Panel notes that the issue under investigation is whether the Bank followed OD 4.20
on Indigenous Peoples during the design, appraisal and execution of the Project with
regard to the Afro-Colombian communities living in the area of the proposed outfall.
Under Colombian legislation the communities living in the North Zone of Cartagena are
not recognized as indigenous peoples, but are classified as black communities and other
ethnic groups. The classification of certain groups as indigenous peoples under Bank
policy OD 4.20 is not necessarily the same as the treatment in local legislation.




                                            xvii

The Panel could find no discussion as to whether the Afro-Colombian communities
should trigger the Indigenous Peoples Policy. Management states that the World Bank's
Quality Assurance Team approved the decision reflected in the Project's Social
Assessment that no indigenous people would be affected by the Project.

The Panel finds that in the case of the Afro-Colombians who submitted the Request,
the affected community meets most of the OD's criteria, except for an "indigenous
language" and arguably a predominant "primarily-oriented subsistence production."
The Panel finds that Afro-Colombians could reasonably have been regarded as
indigenous peoples under Bank policies. But because of the absence of arguably two
of the policy criteria, the failure to do so in this specific case may not be deemed as
noncompliance with the "judgment" called for in OD 4.20, paragraph 5. If the Afro-
Colombians were regarded as indigenous peoples, the provision of OD 4.20 would
have applied.

                         Indigenous Peoples Development Plan

If the affected Afro-Colombian communities had been categorized from the outset as
indigenous peoples under OD 4.20, an IPDP would have been prepared in order to
prevent or mitigate the impacts and to ensure that net benefits would accrue to the
affected indigenous peoples. The Panel finds that there is no complete list, schedule
or financial arrangements of mitigatory measures or compensation for the Project's
risks for the people living in the area of the proposed outfall. The risks are significant
and the mitigatory measures found in the documentation, while strengthened over time,
are weak.

Since the Afro-Colombians could reasonably have been regarded as indigenous
peoples within the indigenous peoples policy, the Panel finds that the Bank would
have been well advised to require an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP)
or a similar document identifying impacts of the Project on these people and
providing mitigation measures for risks and potential harm, particularly in light of
the inadequacies of the Social Impact Assessment.

The Panel notes that the subsequent studies carried out by ACUACAR to develop a base
line for Project monitoring contain a comprehensive set of socio-economic data about the
Project affected communities. This can be used as a basis for developing a set of suitable
compensatory measures.

                                 Social Impact Assessment


                  Identification of Impacts on Affected Communities

The social impacts of the Project were assessed in the Social Impact Assessment (SIA)
prepared in 1998. The Panel notes that most of this social assessment focuses on the
major social benefits to the target population in the city of Cartagena, namely the
Southeast Urban Area. The Panel finds that the full SIA does not adequately address



                                           xviii

compensation for the affected Afro-Colombian communities in the North Zone for
bearing most of the risk of negative impacts of the sewerage component for the
Project.

The Panel finds that the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is unsatisfactory with
respect to its analysis of the Project's impacts upon the communities living in the
North Zone of Cartagena who presented the Request for Inspection. Irrespective of
whether Afro-Colombians are classified as indigenous peoples or not, they are
affected by the Project because they will be exposed to a wide range of risks as a
result of the construction and operation of the Project.

The Panel notes that fishing is one of the traditional occupations of the villages of Punta
Canoa, Manzanillo del Mar and Arroyo de Piedra. The EA itself acknowledges that a
decrease in fishing resources was one of the main concerns expressed by the people
living in the North zone (the area near Punta Canoa). A 2003 study carried out by
INVEMAR (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeros) documents the bountiful
fisheries caught in the Punta Canoa area and confirms that fishing is the mainstay of
Punta Canoa's economy. Income from seafood pays for all schooling, water, electricity
and housing. In addition, seafood is related to the communities' second and third biggest
contributors to their livelihoods, namely tourism and employment in the shrimp facilities.
In light of the foregoing, the Panel emphasizes that since the sewage outfall is designed to
be located near the main Afro-Colombian fishing grounds, any risks to their seafood must
be taken seriously. The Panel finds that the EA and Management erred in concluding
that fishing in the area of influence of the outfall is negligible or unimportant in the
affected communities, without more detailed studies about the issue.

             Benefits for Afro-Colombian Communities in the North Zone

The Panel notes that the Afro-Colombian communities in the North Zone seem to have
been considered less important than the major beneficiaries of Cartagena. They are
relatively small in numbers, quiet, weak in political power, and lack voice in decisions
that affect them severely. The Panel notes that these communities may be exposed to
significant risks under the Project.

Some compensation for the potential impacts is provided under the Project, e.g.
water and sanitation services in accord with OD 4.01. The Panel notes that the
community will receive piped water, which will be less expensive and of better
quality than trucked water. This will be a significant benefit for the community.
However, it is unclear whether appropriate financial arrangements have been made
to implement other benefits, such as sanitation services, and the maintenance and
operation of community centers. Implementation of the beneficial measures seems
to be lagging behind. Information about these compensatory measures has been
inadequately disseminated to the villages.

The Panel welcomes the proposed benefits for the people living in the Project area but
notes that there seems to be no direct relation between such benefits and the risks that



                                            xix

may be exposed to as a consequence of Project construction and operation. There is no
graduated approach to compensate the population for ­ or mitigate ­ the different risks as
they materialize. For example, there are no social mitigation or compensatory measures
in case of severe malfunction of the outfall that could lead to high presence of pathogens
or other contaminants and/or a need to chlorinate the outfall discharge. This could affect
the water quality near Punta Canoa and may affect people's health and their social and
economic activities. In this sense, the proposed Social Impact Mitigation and
Community Development Program seems to fall short in addressing the mitigation
or compensation for harm related to potential adverse impacts of the Project as
required by OD 4.01.

                                     Consultations

The Panel finds that during Project preparation there were extensive consultation
efforts with the people in Cartagena. This accords with OD 4.01. Two local NGOs ­
Fundación Vida and Fundación Jorge Artel ­ carried out the consultations in the context
of preparing respectively the environmental and the social assessment. However, OD
4.01 requires that there be extensive consultations with all affected people and that
these consultations be timely, meaningful and relevant to Project design and
execution. This is particularly important in the case of the affected Afro-Colombian
communities living in the area of the proposed outfall, who informed the Panel that
they were not consulted about the location of the outfall but rather only informed
about its construction and operation. ACUACAR arranged for a cross-section of
society to inspect existing outfalls, similar to the proposed one for Punta Canoa.
Representatives from all three affected villages visited outfalls in Valparaiso, Chile and
in Montevideo. Unfortunately, this visit took place after the Project had been designed
and its location determined, while OD 4.01 requires this kind of interaction during the
preparation of the Project.

While the Project commendably included a communications strategy, the Panel
observed that it failed to reach most members of the affected communities in the
North Zone. An outreach strategy was added too late to deal effectively with the
Project-related trauma and stress in these communities.            The Panel finds that
consultations and communications with the affected Afro-Colombian communities
in the area of the submarine outfall did not comply with OD 4.01.

                     Consultations and Willingness-to-Pay Surveys

The Panel recognizes that the connection to the water and sewerage network is of
the utmost importance for the North Zone communities. However, the Panel did not
find any evidence that a formal consultation process on all the aspects of water and
sewerage issues took place with the community of Punta Canoa. The Panel finds
that the willingness-to-pay surveys did not include Punta Canoa (or Manzanillo)
and these communities were not adequately consulted on the issues of willingness to
pay and water tariffs.

                             ECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

                            Economic Evaluation of Alternatives

The feasibility study includes economic analysis of alternatives for disposal of the waste
(except for a land application option, RG 1, that was not costed), and so broadly complies
with OP 10.04

The Panel notes that after the Board approved the Project, CARDIQUE, the regional
environmental authority, issued in 2001 the environmental license for the submarine
outfall, which required the installation after ten years of primary treatment of the wastes
at the preliminary treatment plant at Punta Canoa. This requirement for primary treatment
in ten years significantly raises both the costs of investment and of operation and
maintenance of the submarine outfall option, according to the figures given in the
feasibility study. The Management Response confirms that the District will be
responsible for upgrading the plant to primary treatment.

When the estimates from the feasibility study are reworked to allow for the upgrading to
primary treatment, they suggest the following: compared with what they would otherwise
have been, investment costs after 10 years could rise by between about US $24 and $32
million, while the present value of total costs (including operation and maintenance),
could increase by between about US $30 to $34 million, thus raising total costs for the
Project from the original value of about US$ 62 million to US $93 to $96 million (or
about $3 million less, using alternative land prices as discussed below). These values are
close to those of options MC-5 (Land Application ­ submarine outfall) and C-4
(Stabilization lagoons ­ discharge to the Cienaga) given in Table 6-28 of the feasibility
study.

OP 10.04 provides that the "[c]onsideration of alternatives is one of the most important
features of proper analysis throughout the project cycle." The Panel finds that when the
environmental license was issued for the submarine outfall requiring primary
treatment in ten years, the Bank should have recalculated the costs of the alternative
and reviewed the economic analysis in light of this new licensing requirement, to be
consistent with OP 10.04.

The Panel also observes that the prices used for the evaluation of land that needed to be
acquired for the options greatly exceeded estimates prepared in 2001 by local real estate
corporations. When the costs of the alternatives that appeared in the feasibility study
(Table 6-28) were re-calculated, to take into account the ranges of these alternative land
costs (adjusted to the base year of the study), the gap between the three lowest cost
options narrowed significantly. In particular, the gap between the chosen option (MC-1:
preliminary treatment with the submarine outfall) and option MC-5 (land application
with the outfall) fell from US$35 million to US$23-27 million, i.e. by almost one third to
one seventh of its original size. Also the gap between the chosen option and option C-4
(stabilization ponds and discharge to the Lagoon) fell by one half to almost one third of
its original size, i.e. from US$32 million to US$16-20 million.



                                             xxi

The Panel finds that, having acknowledged uncertainty about land prices, the
analysis in the feasibility study did not then provide a clear justification for the
prices used in the costing of the Project alternatives.

As noted earlier, the Bank appointed an international Panel of Experts in the field of
sewage, waste water treatment, and marine outfall technology to review and advise on the
ongoing work in the feasibility study of alternatives and in Project design. This offered a
potentially valuable additional avenue of scrutiny. However, in the Panel's view, given
the longstanding controversy concerning the preferred option to address the City's
wastewater problems, it would have been appropriate to have had the Panel of
Experts include a wider range of expertise, to provide more authoritative findings
about both the socioeconomic impacts and the economic costs of the alternatives
considered.

                The Economic Analysis and Compliance with OP 10.04

Key parts of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) discuss aspects of the economic
analysis as required by OP 10.04. Part 3 of Section F discusses Possible Controversial
Aspects and identifies two issues, the use of a submarine outfall as part of a wastewater
treatment and disposal system, which it suggests "may cause some controversy due to
lack of understanding of the technology", and the already planned increase in tariffs. It is
acknowledged that "The authorized annual tariff increase is a controversial issue, and
ACUACAR considers that it will become more and more difficult to generate the
corresponding revenues," and that consequently there is a need to avoid further increases
above those already authorized. The Panel observes, however, that there is little
discussion about connection fees for access to new water and sewerage services,
although they are potentially controversial and might influence the economic
performance of the Project, particularly in relation to poorer consumers, as
previous Bank experience confirms.

                                   Cost Benefit Analysis

In the PAD, Annex 4, Part III (Assumptions), outlines the data sources and assumptions
used in the analyses. It notes that ACUACAR was the primary source of data "regarding
market demand and supply, project specifics, comprehensive cost and investment data,
project financing details, expected financial returns, and market distortions." These data
include coverage levels. However, no reference is made as to whether the Bank
performed any checks on the validity and reliability of these data, although they
formed essential building blocks for the analyses. The Panel finds that, even though
it would not have been feasible to scrutinize and validate all parts of these data, the
PAD should have examined the issue of data reliability as part of showing
compliance with OP 10.04.

                                     Economic Viability

The PAD states that the Project's economic viability was appraised for each subproject
after converting financial cash flows into economic cash flows through the use of
conversion factors and of willingness to pay estimates that included use and non-use
values of water supply and sewerage services.          This is consistent with OP10.14.
However, the Panel finds that the PAD did not try to make further - necessarily
approximate - estimates of the enhanced tourism and recreational benefits likely to
be associated with the Project, which is surprising given the acknowledged
importance of tourism to the economy of Cartagena.

The PAD notes that tourism is the main income source in the city and quotes
700,000 annual visitors and estimated revenues of US$315 million generated. The
Panel finds that the Bank should have considered these benefits to be consistent with
OP 10.04, which says that: "[t]he economic evaluation of Bank-financed projects
takes into account any domestic and cross-border externalities." Such estimates might
possibly have been attempted using a `benefit transfer approach' and hence drawing on
other existing studies from Colombia or elsewhere.

                                Sensitivity and Risk Analysis

Annex 4 of the PAD describes the sensitivity and risk analysis and defines major risk
variables:  investment cost overruns, project delays, changes in the unaccounted for
water, labor productivity, collection efficiency and the willingness to pay for access to
new and improved services. Table 7 on Risk Variables and Their Impact and Risk
Significance describes seven variables, only three of which are included in the previous
list. This suggests a total of ten key risk variables.

While the PAD says that the risk analysis recalculated the results of the financial and
economic analysis by changing "these major risk variables all at the same time," it is
unhelpful because it only sets out the probability distributions and ranges that were used
for five of the variables. There is no obvious reason why this was not done for the
remaining variables and it makes it impossible for the reader to gain a full picture
of the procedures, underlying rationales and results of the sensitivity and risk
analysis. The analysis does not discuss the responsiveness of net present values to
variations in Willingness-to-Pay (WTP), a key variable, and, although OP 10.04 says that
"The analysis estimates the switching values of key variables (i.e., the value that each
variable must assume to reduce the net present value of the project to zero)[...]" the
economic sensitivity analysis does not mention them.. The presentation of the sensitivity
and risk analysis in this Part of the PAD compares relatively poorly with the more
detailed corresponding presentation in the Financial Assessment (Annex 5 and
Attachment 3), which - amongst other details - does present switching values. In the
Panel's view, therefore, the PAD's sensitivity and risk analysis is inadequate under
OP 10.04's provisions relating to risk.

                       Cost Benefit Analysis Summary in the PAD

In the Panel's view, although the underlying economic evaluation may have been
carried out competently and broadly in line with OP 10.04, parts of the material in
Annex 4 are not presented and explained in the PAD with sufficient clarity,
transparency and consistency to demonstrate this compliance. This matters because
partial or confusing explanations in the PAD risk failing successfully to
communicate and confirm to stakeholders the nature and robustness of the
appraisal processes that the Bank's operational procedures like OP 10.04 promote
and require. This could be important for a Project that is acknowledged to have
controversial aspects.

                                     Poverty Reduction

In view of the Project's design and the locations that will be affected, there seems
little doubt that substantial numbers of poor people in the city of Cartagena are
intended to and seem likely to experience significant benefits associated with the
provision of enhanced access to and quality of water and sewerage services.
However, the effects on the poverty of affected communities near Punta Canoa are less
clear.

In relation specifically to the economic analysis, OP 10.04 requires that it examine "the
Project's consistency with the Bank's poverty reduction strategy." The PAD observes,
however, that the income data collected during the WTP surveys made it "impossible to
calculate with any accuracy the impact of the project on the poor." The evidence on
poverty impact analysis in the PAD is limited to the highly aggregated `poor'/'non-
poor' columns of Table 6 in Annex 4 and eight lines of text. In the Panel's view, this
is an issue of great importance to the Project. Given that the first of the Project
development objectives is to improve water and sewerage services and sanitary
conditions of the city's poorest population, and where ­ as with many projects that
may benefit poor people ­ it is possible that some of the poor may gain while others
lose, it is disturbing that more effort was not put in during the Project preparation
and appraisal to enable sufficient income and/or other data to be assembled to
assess the Project's impacts on the poor"with any accuracy."

                            Effects on the Three Communities

Management maintains that no evidence supports the claim that the outfall will be
detrimental to the economic activity of fishermen from Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra
and Manzanillo and that "fishing activity, to the extent that it might occur in these areas
would not be adversely affected." However, apart from any scientific analysis of the
probable impacts of the outfall, there are also issues of perceptions and public
acceptability which can have real impacts on Project outcomes. Thus, if the outfall were
perceived to be polluting, and if the evidence to the contrary were not trusted by the
public at large, including tourists, then there would be a potential for damage to the




                                           xxiv

markets for local fish. This could significantly affect livelihoods in Punta Canoa and
nearby villages.

While the Management Response points appropriately to the environmental monitoring
program and the "availability of technical mitigatory measures if needed (chlorination
and/or future waste stream treatment beyond preliminary treatment)," such measures
alone might be seen by the fishing communities as being reactive and insufficient to
address the harm they might suffer before the mitigating measures were both put into
effect and widely accepted by the wider community of residents and tourists as being
effective. Moreover, chlorination may pose its own risks.

There are, therefore, risks to these poor communities which have not been properly
and explicitly addressed in the appraisal of the Project. Had this been done, it might
then have been possible both to reassure the concerned communities about the levels
of risk and/or to put in place fall-back mechanisms that would provide trustworthy
and timely "insurance" or compensation were the events to arise. In the Panel's
view, therefore, in relation to risk the Bank has not complied with OD 4.15.
Compliance would have meant giving greater and earlier attention to the risks to
and concerns of these communities, whose willingness to accept the location and
consequences of the outfall was key to the successful delivery of the potentially very
substantial benefits intended for so many of Cartagena's other poor citizens.

      Potential Impacts on Other Poverty-Reducing Investments by the District

The Management Response states that the District was required to keep other
infrastructure investments apart from this project "to a minimum." In the Panel's view,
the decision to focus on water and sewerage investments was not inappropriate, but
given the Project's potential consequences in keeping other alternative poverty-
reducing infrastructure investments "to a minimum", the potential impact on other
poverty reducing investments should have been properly addressed. This could have
given confidence that the Project was the best use of the scarce financial resources of
the District, and thus shown compliance with OD 4.15.

              FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE AND SUPERVISION

             Financial Management Assessment of the District of Cartagena

Because the District would not be in charge of Project implementation, the Bank decided
it would not need to carry out a financial management assessment for the District. Given
the assumptions reflected in the PAD--that about 55% of the funds to be made
available by the District would come from Unified Property Tax/Impuesto Predial
Unificado (IPU) revenues-- the Panel finds that the Bank should have paid more
attention to the District's internal control and management problems and should
have carried out an in-depth financial management assessment of the District. The
Bank should then have worked with the District on an action plan to improve the
District's property tax registers and its billing and collection systems.



                                           xxv

Since the Bank was aware of the District's internal control and management
problems, it should have required that the District, as the borrower of the Bank
loan, have its accounts and financial statements audited by independent auditors
each year and provide a copy of the audit report to the Bank. The independent
auditors would have highlighted these problems in their report, and the Bank could have
addressed any emerging problems early on during Project supervision, including seeking
actions by the District and obtaining the support of the Ministry of Finance to find a
satisfactory solution to this problem.

The Panel finds that the Bank should have carried out a financial management
assessment for the District of Cartagena, as the borrower of the Bank loan, at the
time of Project preparation and appraisal. Since it did not, it did not comply with its
own policies and procedures set out in OP/BP 10.02. Furthermore, during
supervision, while the Bank had an opportunity to address the problem of the
shortfall in IPU receipts, it did not actively pursue that matter. The Panel also finds
that the decision making within the Bank, as it refers to accepting audit reports that
are not fully in compliance with the requirements of the Loan Agreement, did not
follow Bank procedures. Hence, it did not comply with its own policies and
procedures set out in OP/BP 13.05.

                      Project Financial and Accounting Statements

The Panel notes that the Project funds are channeled directly to ACUACAR, the Project
implementing agency. The Bank ensured that the District would earmark and pledge a
percentage of its tax receipts to fund its share of the Project and to repay the Bank loan.
The funds from the tax receipts go directly into a fiduciary trust fund managed by an
independent financial administrator. The Panel finds that the agreed institutional and
financial arrangements for the Project specifically address the uncertainties in the
claimants' complaint, and that the processes followed comply with the Bank's OP
10.02.

Given the supervision and scrutiny of ACUACAR, the Panel finds that the District
of Cartagena receives sufficient information and assistance from other Government
institutions to manage adequately the partnership agreements.

                    Financial Capacity of the District of Cartagena

The Panel notes that although from a strict Project point of view the Bank carried
out its due diligence in accordance with its policies and procedures, it misjudged the
importance to the Project of improving the borrower's capacity to collect the IPU
taxes. Pledging a percentage of IPU revenues was not enough to guarantee that the
District would be able to meet its financial obligations to the Project.

                  Financial Management Assessment--ACUACAR

The Panel finds that the Bank carried out an adequate financial management
assessment on ACUACAR in accordance with Bank policies and procedures.

With respect to supervision of ACUACAR, the Panel finds that the supervision
reports on financial management by ACUACAR are complete and informative.
Aside from some shortcomings of the audit reports that are noted in the main text of
the Investigation Report, the Bank has covered this aspect, including financial and
operational internal control matters, very thoroughly.

                          Financial Capacity--ACUACAR

The Panel finds that the Bank satisfactorily carried out its due diligence during
Project preparation with regard to ascertaining the financial capacity of
ACUACAR. This is in line with its policies and procedures.

                          Bank Supervision of ACUACAR

With regard to ACUACAR, the Panel finds that the Bank closely supervises the
performance of ACUACAR and is in compliance with its policy on Project
supervision, OP/BP 13.05.

                          Risk of Default on the Bank Loan

The Panel finds that at the time of Project preparation the Bank carried out detailed
financial analyses and projections, including sensitivity tests, on the revenue and
cost statements for the District of Cartagena and ACUACAR.

The Panel finds that the Bank adequately carried out financial projections for the
District as well as for ACUACAR and reached satisfactory institutional
arrangements to ensure proper Project financing and loan repayment. The Panel
finds that the Bank carried out its due diligence with regard to repayment of the
loan in line with OP/BP10.02.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION




            1

1. Request for an investigation

         1.     On April 20, 2004, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection2
                ("the Request") alleging that the World Bank violated its own policies and
                procedures in the design, appraisal and implementation of the Colombia:
                Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management
                Project ("the Project"). The Request claimed that this violation caused and
                will cause harm to the communities living in areas north of the city of
                Cartagena and to human health and the marine environment.

         2.     The Panel registered the Request on April 22, 2004, and notified the World
                Bank Board of Executive Directors ("the Board") and the President of its
                receipt.

         3.     On May 21, 2004, Management submitted its Response to the Request for
                Inspection.

1.1 Background

         4.     Cartagena de Indias is the fifth largest city in Colombia and its most
                important tourism area. It is also the site of the most extensive Spanish
                colonial fortifications in South America. In 1984, Cartagena's Port, the
                Fortresses and a Group of Monuments were inscribed in the UNESCO's
                World Heritage List.3

         5.     According to the PAD, Cartagena's population of about 900,000 people has
                grown in recent years at a rate of 2.5 percent per year and has doubled in the
                past twenty years.4        This increase is mainly due to migration from rural
                Colombia of people displaced by violence in the countryside and in search
                of new economic opportunities. Because of the high immigration of poor
                people, 84 percent of Cartagena's population is of low and medium income,
                31 percent of whichis extremely poor.5

         6.     Cartagena is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, the Cartagena Bay and the
                Ciénaga de la Virgen, a lagoon also known as Ciénaga Tesca, and is

              traversed by interconnected water courses. These water bodies are seriously
              contaminated by wastewater because they are the repositories of the
              untreated municipal and industrial liquid wastes of the city, 30% of which is
              discharged into the Cartagena Bay, 60% into the Ciénaga de La Virgen and
              10% into the water courses.6 In addition, as Cartagena's population is
              growing rapidly, the city is experiencing rapid expansion of informal
              settlements, the largest of which is encroaching into the wetlands along the
              southern shores of the Ciénaga de la Virgen. As a result, many poor people
              are living in damp squalid conditions with an exceptionally low quality of
              life, the lagoon margin is being destroyed, and the already poor quality of
              the lagoon waters is further deteriorating because of the direct discharge of
              human wastes into it.

       7.     The poor neighborhoods of Cartagena, which are mainly concentrated
              around the Ciénaga de la Virgen, lack sewerage networks; raw sewage also
              flows in the streets creating alarming sanitary conditions. Because the
              provision of water and sanitation infrastructure in the Cartagena's poor
              areas has not kept pace with the rapid growth of the city, the rich parts of
              Cartagena have high coverage of water and sewerage, while the poorer
              areas still lack these basic services. The present situation has generated
              public health, sanitation and environmental problems that deteriorate the
              population's quality of life and threaten both the tourism sector ­ the main
              income source of the city ­ and Cartagena's general economic development.

       8.     According to Management, in an effort to improve both the efficiency and
              extent of water and sanitation delivery, a major restructuring of the water
              and sanitation sector in Colombia took place in 1991. In Cartagena, in 1993,
              poor quality of services and inefficiencies led the municipality to close out,
              with Bank assistance, the municipal water and sewerage utility and to
              introduce private sector participation for providing these services. In 1994,
              the municipality of Cartagena and the Spanish "Aguas de Barcelona"
              (AGBAR), Barcelona's water company, partnered to create a public-private
              entity, Aguas de Cartagena (ACUACAR), which took over responsibility
              for provision of water and sewerage services to the city in June 1995.
              Attempts to improve the Cartagena water supply, sewerage system and
              environment have been made for at least 20 years and there has been
              ongoing involvement of the World Bank in this sector together with the
              City of Cartagena and ACUACAR7. Since the creation of ACUACAR in
              1995 these efforts have been accelerated and have led to the present Water
              Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project, which is the
              subject of the Panel's investigation.

municipal water company and create a new public-private enterprise through Loan 2961-CO for the
Colombia Water Supply and Sewerage Project.


                                                   3

        9.    The Project, as described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD),
              focuses on improving infrastructure services and ensuring sustainable
              development. It aims at expanding the water supply and sanitation coverage
              in Cartagena and improving water supply and sewage services, particularly
              in the city's poor neighborhoods. To increase the collection, treatment and
              adequate disposal of sewage in Cartagena would allow to reduce pollution
              of the Cartagena Bay, the Ciénaga, and the Caribbean beaches, as well as to
              decrease environmental health risks faced by the population, particularly the
              urban poor.8 As described in more detail below,9 the Project main
              components include the expansion of the water supply and sewerage
              systems; the construction of a main wastewater conveyance system, of
              wastewater treatment installations and of a submarine outfall 2.85km off the
              coast of Punta Canoa, about 20km north of Cartagena. The Project
              description includes also mitigation measures to address the Project's
              environmental and social impacts.

1.2. The Request

        10.   The Corporación Cartagena Honesta (CCH), a local non-governmental
              organization, submitted the Request on its own behalf and on behalf of 125
              residents of Punta Canoa, 139 residents of Arroyo de Piedra, 41 residents of
              Manzanillo del Mar, and 119 residents of Cartagena.

        11.   The Requesters claim that the proposed submarine outfall to be constructed
              off the coast of Punta Canoa will pollute the marine environment, which
              supports fisheries that, together with tourism activities, provide the people
              of the area with their primary source of food and income. They believe that,
              as a result of the Project, untreated wastewater will be discharged into the
              sea, and will contaminate the marine life and have a serious and permanent
              impact on the people's health and livelihood.

        12.   The Requesters challenge the soundness of the Project design, in particular
              the degree of treatment to which the effluent discharged by the outfall into
              the Caribbean Sea will be subject. They argue that preliminary treatment
              will not remove bacteria or chemical pollutants, thus causing pathogenic
              and chemical contamination of the coastal waters. The Requesters add that
              the monitoring program, designed to deal with events where harmful
              bacteria from the waste flow may reach nearby beaches, will not provide
              adequate protection against potentially life-threatening pollution. They
              assert that chemical contamination would deplete the fish stocks and could
              have severe human health impacts for fishermen and anyone else exposed to
              the tainted fish or contaminated water.

                                              4

13. The Requesters allege that the Bank violated its policy and procedures on
    Environmental Assessment because the Project's environmental assessment
    (EA) carried out by the Borrower failed to consider adequately potential
    damage to human health and the marine environment and dismissed more
    environmentally sound and financially viable alternatives to the submarine
    outfall option. Further, they believe that the EA did not properly take into
    account the geological conditions of the area around Punta Canoa, which is
    subject to diapirism or mud volcanism. This phenomenon, the Requesters
    argue, could rupture the outfall pipeline without warning and cause the
    effluent to be accidentally discharged much closer to the shore. They also
    allege that the consultation requirements of the Bank policy on
    Environmental Assessment were not complied with. The Requesters believe
    that, in spite of the residents' level of concern and opposition to the
    submarine outfall, the EA addressed the social and economic effects on the
    villages only in a cursory fashion.

14. The Requester claim that the EA also failed to identify and to address
    adequately the requirements of the domestic laws and regulations and to
    take into account the 1983 Convention for the Protection and Development
    of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region. In their views,
    the construction of the outfall, as designed, will violate the convention's
    provisions and those of the 1999 Aruba Protocol to the Cartagena
    Convention on Land-based Sources of Pollution signed by the Republic of
    Colombia in 2000.

15. The Requesters allege that the Bank violated its policy on Indigenous
    Peoples (OD 4.20) because the Project failed to identify the affected
    communities living in Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra, and Manzanillo del
    Mar as indigenous peoples, and thus failed to prepare an Indigenous
    Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) to avoid and mitigate the Project's
    adverse impacts on these communities. In the Requester's view, the people
    living in Punta, Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra, and Manzanillo del Mar are Afro-
    Colombian indigenous peoples who meet the requirements of OD 4.20.

16. The Requesters further claim that the potential fiscal instability of the
    Borrower and the expected increase in the total cost of the Project, which
    could cause the Borrower to default on the loan, will cause them harm.
    They also allege that by accepting inaccurate financial and accounting
    statements from the Borrower, the District of Cartagena, the Bank violated
    OP/BP 10.02 ­ Financial Management. In addition, by failing to scrutinize
    adequately and effectively the economic and environmental risk evaluations
    of the outfall and the alternative options for disposing of wastes, the Bank
    did not comply with OP/BP 10.04, on Economic Evaluation of Investment
    Operations.




                                    5

        17.    With respect to Project supervision, according to the Requesters, the Bank
               did not comply with OD/OP/BP 13.05 ­ Project Supervision. The
               Requesters finally state that they have raised the issues described in the
               Request with the Bank on numerous occasions, but were not satisfied with
               the responses and explanations they have received from Bank staff.

1.3. Management Response

        18.    On May 21, 2004, the Panel received Management's Response to the
               Inspection Panel Request, which is briefly summarized below.          10


        19.    Management claims that the Bank correctly applied its policies and
               procedures and that the Project will not cause any harm to the marine
               environment or to human health. As a result, according to Management, the
               Requesters' rights have not been, nor are likely to be, adversely affected by
               a failure of the Bank to follow its own policies and procedures.

        20.    In response to the Request's claims regarding the Project's Environmental
               Assessment, Management contends that the EA - as well as the process of
               preparing the EA - for the wastewater treatment plant, the wastewater
               conveyor and the submarine outfall comply with OD 4.01. Management
               also notes that the EA was based on a Feasibility Study for Wastewater
               Treatment and Disposal (FS), which addressed issues of human health and
               the marine environment. This FS study also analyzed, from the technical,
               economic, environmental, and social perspectives, a comprehensive set of
               alternatives combining different treatment and final disposal sites including
               all but one of the options proposed by the Requesters. Management
               emphasizes that "an international firm of high repute11" conducted the FS
               study, which a Panel of Experts (POE) composed of internationally
               recognized wastewater management experts; the Colombian Oceanographic
               Institute (CIOH); and the regional environmental authority, CARDIQUE,
               reviewed. CARDIQUE subsequently issued the environmental license
               ratified by the Ministry of Environment.

        21.    Management asserts that the EA analyzed the impacts of the Project on the
               coastal zones and concluded that the planned outfall would minimize the
               risk that the discharged effluent would have any harmful effects, such as
               pathogenic bacterial contamination, on the coastal zones, including those
               near Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo del Mar and those near
               Cartagena. However, Management adds that to mitigate potential negative
               environmental impacts, a set of precautionary measures was designed, such

Sewerage, and Environmental Management Project (IBRD Loan No. 4507-CO), May 21, 2004, in
Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation, June 30, 2004, Annex 2 [hereinafter "Management
Response"].
11Management Response, Annex 1, Item 4, p. 32.


                                                 6

    as monitoring, chlorination installations, and a contingency plan for the
    collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater.

22. With respect to the geological conditions of the Project area, Management
    contends that the FS, the EA, and the studies conducted by the Marine
    Resources and an expert hired by ACUACAR addressed this issue and
    confirmed that the risk of diapirism, or mud volcanism, in the area is low
    because there is an absence of large magnitude seismic activity and
    magmatic volcanism.

23. As to the issue of inadequate consultations raised by the Requesters,
    Management claims that consultations were conducted in compliance with
    OD 4.01 and that during project preparation a participatory approach was
    used.

24. Management also contends that, under domestic laws and regulations,
    marine outfalls are permissible provided that appropriate studies are
    conducted. The Response adds that the Requesters have previously raised
    these legal arguments with the Colombia administrative adjudication
    process which has already adjudicated each of them. Management
    emphasizes, however, that even if the claims had not been adjudicated
    under Colombian law, they do not arise out of an act or omission of the
    Bank in failing to follow its own policies and procedures. As to the claims
    regarding the violation of international law, according to the Response,
    Colombia is a party to the 1983 Convention for the Protection and
    Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region,
    but not to the 1999 Protocol Concerning Pollution from Land-based Sources
    and Activities in the Wider Caribbean Region. The Protocol is thus not
    binding and its provisions not applicable to Colombia.

25. In response to the claim that the communities living in the north zone of
    Cartagena are indigenous peoples, Management claims that these
    communities do not meet the criteria set forth in OD 4.20, and thus, there
    was no need to develop an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan during
    Project preparation. Nonetheless, Management claims that consultations
    with these communities were conducted as part of the Social Assessment
    process and in order to prepare the Social Impact Mitigation and
    Community Development Program, and that the concerns expressed by the
    affected people were reflected in the Project design.

26. With respect to the financial management of the Project, including the
    possible risk of default of the borrower and inaccuracies in the financial and
    accounting statements, Management states that the work carried out in
    Project preparation and supervision is in line with good practice on financial
    analysis. Management contends that the Project complies with OP 10.02.
    Similarly, Management maintains that the cost effectiveness analysis



                                    7

              carried out by Hazen & Sawyer and the cost benefit analysis conducted by
              Bank staff and Soluciones Integrales (SI), a local consultancy firm, comply
              withOP 10.04.

        27.   As to Project supervision, Management claims that the supervision of the
              Project has been thorough and in compliance with OD 13.05 and OP/BP
              13.05. The Response adds that the Bank has conducted 13 missions to the
              Project area, has reviewed quarterly Project Management Reports (PMRs)
              that ACUACAR prepared and submitted, and has participated in several
              consultation meetings making presentations on the technical aspects of the
              Project. Management Response also rejects the allegations regarding
              conflict of interest situations between Bank Staff, ACUACAR's and
              CARDIQUE's officials.

        28.   Management states that, under the Project, the communities of Punta Canoa,
              Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo will receive benefits such as piped water
              services; in-house sanitation facilities; community centers; an orchard for
              Punta Canoa to support post-construction reforestation facilities; work
              opportunities during Project construction; improvement of the environment;
              and, "[s]hould additional funds exist from project savings" sanitation
              services through a sewerage network. According to Management, the
              Project thus complies with OD 4.15 on Poverty Reduction.

        29.   Finally, Management claims to have responded in a timely fashion to all
              letters sent by the Requesters and to have provided available material when
              requested.

1.4. Eligibility of the Request

        30.   To determine the eligibility of the Request and the Requesters the Panel
              reviewed the Request for Inspection and Management Response. The Panel
              Chairperson, Professor Edith Brown Weiss, together with Executive
              Secretary Eduardo Abbott and Operations Officer Tatiana Tassoni, visited
              Bogotá, Cartagena, and villages north of Cartagena, Colombia, from June
              10 through June 16, 2004.

        31.   During the field visit, the Panel team met with the Requesters and other
              people    in  affected   communities,     representatives  of   ACUACAR,
              CARDIQUE and INGEOMINAS, national, regional and local government
              officials, local NGOs, technical experts and prominent citizens of
              Cartagena.

        32.   The Panel determined that the Request fulfilled the eligibility requirements
              for Inspection. Because the Request and the Management Response contain
              conflicting assertions and interpretations concerning the issues, the facts,
              compliance with Bank policies and procedures, actual harm, and potential



                                             8

                harm, the Panel recommended an investigation to the Board of Executive
                Directors.

1.5 The Board Decision

         33.    On July 13, 2004, the Board approved the Panel's recommendation to
                conduct an investigation into the matters alleged in the Request for
                Inspection. The Request, Management Response, and the Panel's Report
                and Recommendation, in English and Spanish, were made public shortly
                after the Board authorized the inspection sought by the Requesters.

1.6 The Investigation

         34.    The purpose of the investigation was to establish whether the Bank
                complied with its own policies and procedures in the design, appraisal and
                implementation of the Colombia: Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage, and
                Environmental Management Project, and whether, if instances of non-
                compliance were found, they caused, or were likely to cause, harm to the
                Requesters and the people they represent.

         35.    The Panel conducted a two-part investigation.                The first part involved
                detailed research into Bank records related to the Project and interviews
                with Bank management and staff. The second part took the form of an in-
                country fact-finding visit. To assist in its investigation, the Panel hired six
                consultants, who are internationally recognized experts in their respective
                fields:      Professor Richard Fuggle, environmental scientist, Robert
                Goodland, social scientist and ecologist, Professor Jorg Imberger,
                environmental engineer and ocean outfalls specialist, Roberto Mosse,
                financial specialist, Professor Peter Pearson, economist, and Professor
                Carlos Tucci, hydrologist12.

         36.    Panel member Tongroj Onchan accompanied by Executive Secretary
                Eduardo Abbott and the expert consultants visited Bogotá, Cartagena, and
                villages north of Cartagena, Colombia, from October 21 to October 30,
                2004. The Panel met with the Requesters, with high officials of the
                Government of Colombia (GOC), and with ACUACAR officials and staff,
                who had an open and frank dialogue with the Panel and were very helpful in
                assisting in its investigation. Consistent with its mandate, the Panel
                independently visited the Project areas and consulted with affected people.




12 The Panel would also like to thank Dr. Jake Piper, environmental assessment specialist and Research
Fellow, Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development, for her comprehensive review of the Project
Feasibility Study (Estudio de Factibilidad para el Tratamiento de las Aguas Residuales de Cartagena y para
la Disposición Final del Efluente al Mar Adyacente a través de un Emisario Submarino, Informe Final,
Hazen and Sawyer, October 1998).


                                                      9

         37.    The Panel also conducted interviews with the Bank's management and staff
                in Washington, D.C. before and after visiting the Project affected area. In its
                investigation, the Panel identified and carefully reviewed all documents
                relevant to the case that the Requesters, Bank staff, ACUACAR officials,
                CARDIQUE officials and other sources provided to the Panel. The Panel
                also analyzed other evidence gathered during the field visits or otherwise in
                its research.

         38.    This Report presents the results of the Panel's investigation regarding the
                different set of environmental, social, financial and economic issues the
                Requesters raise in their submission to the Panel.

2. The Project

         39.    According to the Loan Agreement, the objectives of the Project are to: "(a)
                improve the water and sewerage services in the territory of the Borrower
                and the sanitary conditions of the Borrower's poorest population (b)
                facilitate the environmental cleanup of water bodies surrounding the
                territory of the Borrower (Cartagena Bay, Caribbean beaches, and
                Cíenaga de la Virgen lake); and (c) improve the sustainability of water
                and sewerage services in the Borrower territory through a private sector
                participation model."13

         40.    The Project includes the following components:14

                  a. Expansion of the water supply system: expanding the water production
                      system, replacing the primary distribution mains, and other measures;

                  b. Expansion of the sewerage system in the Ciénaga Basin: improving
                      sanitation conditions by enhancing the conveyance capacity of existing
                      sewage collectors and expanding the secondary sewerage network in
                      the southwest, southeast, and central parts of the city which currently
                      drain to the Ciénaga, and by constructing new pressure lines, pumping
                      stations and gravity collectors;

                  c. Construction of the main conveyance system of the wastewater to the
                      treatment plant: clean-up of the water bodies surrounding Cartagena
                      which currently receive wastewater ­ the Bay, the Ciénaga, the
                      beaches and the water courses. This component includes upgrading the
                      Paraíso pumping station, constructing the pipeline from Paraíso
                      pumping station to the treatment plant site and constructing the
                      effluent pipeline from the plant to the submarine outfall. The

                  conveyance system would consist of a 72 inch in diameter pressure
                  pipe with a total length of 23.85km;

               d. Construction         of  treatment  installations: providing  preliminary
                  treatment to remove floatable materials, grease, oil, sand, and grit;

               e. Construction of a submarine outfall for the discharge of the treated
                  effluent to the Caribbean Sea near Punta Canoa;

               f. Industrial wastewater discharge control: identifying key sources of
                  industrial pollution in the city of Cartagena, establishing a system for
                  regulating the discharge of industrial wastes, and a system for auditing
                  industrial waste discharge, defining strategies to control small and
                  dispersed sources of industrial pollution, and providing technical
                  assistance for the pretreatment process;

               g. Environmental and social component: measures mitigating the
                  environmental          and  social impacts    of  the Project,  including
                  environmental supervision during construction, the restoration and
                  conservation of the Ciénaga de la Virgen nature reserve, a monitoring
                  program before and after construction of the submarine outfall to study
                  pathogenic coliforms and other contaminants discharged through the
                  outfall and an environmental institutional strengthening program. A
                  Social Impact Mitigation and Community Development Program
                  includes organization and strengthening of the communities and other
                  measures. The District will also supply piped water to the communities
                  of the North Zone as a condition of the Loan;15

               h. Project management: technical assistance, studies, design and
                  supervision of works: support and partial financing for Project
                  management, design and supervision of the water supply systems and
                  the sewerage systems works; design of the main wastewater
                  conveyance system, treatment installations and submarine outfall;
                  supervision of the main conveyance system works, the treatment
                  installation, the submarine outfall works; and procurement audits.

       41.   According to the PAD, the submarine outfall will be 2.850km long, have
             72" diameter, discharge wastewater at a seawater depth of 20 m, with a total
             capacity of 4 m³/s by year 2025; and will have a 0.5km long diffuser with
             27 vertical riser pipes and 2 ports each for a total of 54 ports.16 The
             submarine outfall will be built off the coast of Punta Canoa, a village
             located some 20 km north of Cartagena.

         42.   The PAD provides that after the construction period ­estimated in five years
               (1999-2004)17 at the time of PAD preparation­ the operation of the outfall
               will be implemented in two phases: Phase 1 (2005-2015) and Phase 2
               (2015-2025). The first phase, under the Bank-financed Project, includes the
               pumping station, the land conveyance system, the preliminary treatment
               installations and the submarine outfall. Management states in the Response
               that the second phase was modified from its original design after
               CARDIQUE,           the    Regional     Environmental         Authority,      issued   the
               environmental license for the Project in June 2001 to provide for the
               "upgrading of the treatment plant from preliminary treatment to primary or
               the equivalent.18"

2.1. Context

         43.   The Panel notes the urgent need for Cartagena to have in place a sustainable
               system for disposing of its sewage and organic wastes. This is especially
               essential when the population of the city is growing rapidly. Submarine
               outfalls are an established method for disposing of municipal wastes. The
               choice of the submarine outfall as the preferred method for disposing of
               wastes takes place, however, in the context of growing global concern about
               the pollution of the marine environment. While submarine outfalls have
               long served as a method for disposing of land-based wastes, there is
               increasing attention to ensuring that the wastes are properly treated before
               discharge in the oceans and released at sufficient distance and depth to
               protect against harm to the marine environment or nearby coastal areas.
               Moreover, as the need grows for disposing of wastes, there is increasing
               attention to other methods for disposing of land-based wastes, other than in
               the marine environment.

         44.   In the Project before us, the Panel takes note of the very significant efforts
               by Management and staff in the preparation and initial supervision of this
               Project to ensure that the Project is appropriately designed and
               implemented. The Panel hopes that its Report will be of value in assessing
               Bank's compliance with its policies and procedures and in furthering the
               development of a sustainable and equitable waste disposal system.


2.1 Project Financing



17In its Response to the Request for Inspection, Management states that Project's Component A is fully
committed, the majority of its works have been completed and the rest "will be completed before the end of
calendar year 2004." Component B is also fully committed and "will be completed before the end of
2004". As to Component C, D, and E Management states that delays in obtaining the environmental license
for the works have postponed their implementation, which is currently at the bidding stage. Finally,
components F, G, and H "are well advanced and will continue for the entire implementation period as
planned." Management Response, ¶ 25-26.

                 Environmental Management Project is US$117.2 million.19 On December
                 10, 1999, the Bank entered into a Loan Agreement with the Distrito
                 Turístico y Cultural de Cartagena de Indias providing for a US$85 million
                 loan to finance about 72% of the total Project cost.20 In addition to the
                 IBRD Loan, the Project's financing structure includes US$7.58 million
                 from the Borrower, US$4.6 million from ACUACAR, the Project's
                 implementing agency, and US$20 million from the Republic of Colombia,
                 the guarantor of the Loan. The current closing date for the Loan is June 30,
                 2005.

3. Applicability of the Bank Operational Policies and Procedures to the Project

         46.     With respect to this Project, the Panel assessed whether the Bank complied
                 with the following applicable operational policies and procedures:

                 OD 4.01                       Environmental Assessment21

20In April 2004, when the Request for Inspection was filed with the Panel, about 31 percent of the loan had
been disbursed.
21The Requesters allege the Bank's non compliance with OP/BP 4.01. However, the applicable Bank
policy for this Project is OD 4.01, as the Project Information Document was first issued before March 1,
1999. See World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 ­ Environmental Assessment.

CHAPTER TWO: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE




                  14

1. The Project's Environmental Assessment

       47.      The Request for Inspection alleges that, in approving and appraising the
                Project, the Bank has not complied with the standards set out in its
                operational policies and procedures, in particular the policies on
                Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats and Water Resources
                Management. The following sections of this report address the Requesters'
                specific complaints related to environmental issues.

       48.      The Requesters believe that the EA did not adequately consider potential
                adverse impacts of the Project on human health and the marine
                environment. They argue that the coastal zone supports fisheries that supply
                the people of the area with their primary source of food and income. They
                believe that, as a result of the Project, "untreated wastewater"22 will be
                discharged into the sea and will contaminate marine life and have a serious
                and permanent impact on the people's health and livelihood, especially the
                people of Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo del Mar, whose
                lives are "inextricably linked to the health of the Caribbean Sea."23

       49.      Moreover, they claim that the EA focused on potential risks to the tourist
                areas around Cartagena, but did not adequately analyze how the Project will
                similarly affect the immediate coastal zones near Punta Canoa, Arroyo de
                Piedra, and Manzanillo del Mar.

       50.      The   Requesters'    main    complaint     with   respect  to  the   Project's
                Environmental Assessment focuses on their claim that the analysis of
                alternatives required under the Bank policy on Environmental Assessment
                was inadequate. The Request states that the studies approved by the Bank
                "clearly lacked the requisite comprehensive and accurate analysis of viable
                project alternatives24" The Requesters also allege that the EA and the
                Project Feasibility Study "unjustifiably dismissed more environmentally-
                sound and financially-viable (and certain) alternatives" to the outfall option
                that was finally selected. The Request lists a number of alternatives that, in
                the Requesters' view, were rejected because of the "cursory and misleading
                nature" of the analysis of alternatives. The Requesters mention, for
                example, a wastewater treatment plant and reuse system, and oxidation
                lagoons and irrigation of mangrove swamps as possible "ecologically
                sustainable" solutions for the sanitation problem of Cartagena. They believe
                that these options were discarded because "ACUACAR and the World Bank
                had decided from the beginning that the solution to Cartagena's sewage
                problem was a major submarine outfall."25

         51.    In Response to the complaints raised in the Request for Inspection,
                Management states that the Project "will not cause any harm to the marine
                environment or to human health."26 The Response also maintains that the
                EA for the wastewater treatment plant, the wastewater conveyor and the
                submarine outfall, as well as the process of preparing the EA, complies with
                OD 4.01.27

         52.    Management notes that the EA was based on a Feasibility Study for
                Wastewater Treatment and Disposal (FS), which addressed issues of human
                health and the marine environment. A Social Impact Assessment (SIA) also
                analyzed human health impacts of the Cartagena Sanitation Project.28

         53.    Management states that the FS study analyzed a "comprehensive set of
                alternatives"29 combining different treatment and final disposal sites,
                including all but one of the options proposed by the Requesters,30 and that
                "all alternatives were evaluated from technical, economic, environmental,
                and social perspectives."31 According to Management, the FS study
                "identified the submarine outfall as the preferred alternative."32
                Management emphasizes that an international firm of high repute conducted
                the FS study33 and a Panel of Experts (POE) composed of internationally
                recognized experts "conducted six meetings to review the FS, EA and final
                design specifications for the marine outfall."34 According to Management,
                the Colombian Oceanographic Institute (CIOH) reviewed and approved the
                EA and the FS, and the regional environmental authority, CARDIQUE,
                issued an environmental license ratified by the Ministry of Environment.

         54.    Management also emphasizes that the decision regarding the selected
                wastewater management system "coincides with the position of the World
                Health Organization" (WHO), which in its recent guidelines identifies an
                effective outfall preceded by preliminary treatment to have low risk of

29Management Response, Annex 1, Item 4, 30. Fifteen alternatives were addressed.
30Management Response, Annex 1, Item 4, 31, 32. According to the Response, only the Requesters'
proposal for a "combination of biological treatment in oxidation lagoons and irrigation of Cartagena's
mangrove swamps with the treated effluent" was not taken into consideration. This proposal was excluded
because of "the sensitivity of the mangrove ecosystems, considered to be natural habitats under OP 4.04."
31Management Response, Annex 1, Item 4, p. 31. The Response includes a description of some of the
alternatives analyzed, namely those also raised by the Request, and their degree of viability with respect to
the one eventually selected, the submarine outfall.

33Management Response, Annex 1, Item 1, p. 26. The Response states that the consulting firm, Hazen &
Sawyer, also prepared a stand alone document, "Environmental Diagnostic of Outfall Alternatives for the
Disposal of Wastewater in Cartagena," to be submitted as part of the licensing process, which presented an
"analysis of alternatives with particular emphasis on environmental impacts."

             human health impacts."35 In addition, Management states that, according to
             the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), about 100 outfalls similar
             to the one proposed for Cartagena are in operation in other Latin American
             countries such as Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, where they have functioned
             with no problems.36

      55.    In response to the Requesters' claim that the EA did not analyze the
             Project's adverse impacts on the immediate coastal zones of Punta Canoa,
             Arroyo de Piedra, Manzanillo del Mar and Cartagena, Management asserts
             that extensive studies were conducted to analyze the impacts on the coastal
             zones.37 The Response adds that all the studies concluded that "the planned
             outfall would minimize the risk that the discharged effluent would have any
             harmful effects on the coastal zones, including those near Punta Canoa,
             Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo and those near Cartagena."38

      56.    The Response indicates that the submarine outfall as designed "provides
             adequate protection against harmful bacteria from the waste flow reaching
             nearby beaches."39 Although "pathogenic bacterial contamination is the
             main public health risk posed by the proposed outfall [...] [t]his risk is
             reduced by appropriate choice of the outfall location."40 The Response
             explains that bacteria undergo a process of physical dilution and of
             biological decay in the marine environment. Management states that "[t]he
             bacterial die off can be controlled by proper selection of the outfall length,
             since a longer outfall means a longer travel time towards the shore and thus
             a higher die off.41" The proposed outfall extends 2.85km from the shore and
             discharges the wastes at a depth of about 20m.42

      57.    Management states that because a submarine outfall, if not properly
             mitigated, could cause negative environmental impacts, the Project was
             categorized as A to "ensure that proper analysis and mitigation measures
             were incorporated in its design and implementation."43 Management states
             that the Project design includes precautionary measures such as chlorination
             installations, support for the development of a contingency plan for the
             collection,   treatment     and     disposal of   wastewater,      and    "intensive
             monitoring."44

1.1. Screening

        58.     Screening is the critical initial phase in Environmental Assessment. OD
                4.01 paragraph 17 requires the Bank "to decide the nature and extent of the
                EA or environmental analysis to be carried out." Screening assigns a
                project to one of three categories. Category A: A full Environmental
                Assessment is required. Category B: Environmental Analysis is required
                but not a full environmental assessment. Category C: No environmental
                assessment or environmental analysis is required. The Cartagena Water,
                Sewerage and Environmental Management Project was assigned to
                category A under OD 4.01. The Panel finds this to be appropriate and
                in compliance with OD 4.01.


1.2. Stage in Project Cycle

        59.     OD 4.01 requires that the Environmental Assessment occur during project
                preparation so that all environmental consequences are recognized early in
                the project cycle45. Defining precisely the start of the Cartagena Water
                Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project Cycle is
                problematic. The Loan Agreement with the District of Cartagena (Loan No.
                4507-CO) to finance the Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and
                Environmental Management Project was prepared during the period 1995-
                1999, and approved by the Bank Board of Directors in July 1999. The legal
                agreements became effective in January 2000.46 The initiation date for the
                Environmental Assessment is officially recorded as August 1998. A first
                draft was submitted in December 1998, and the Bank reviewed a final draft
                in March 1999.47        However, after the Project Concept Meeting on
                December 15, 1995, the Task Manager for the "Colombia Cartagena Water
                Supply, Sewerage, and Environmental Cleanup Project" provided detailed
                specifications for an Environmental Assessment (EA) Study in a
                Memorandum dated December 21, 1995. The Panel finds that the EA for
                the Project was initiated early in the project cycle, and in this respect
                complied with OD 4.01.


1.3. Analysis of Alternatives

        60.     A basic principle of environmental assessment is that there can be no choice
                if there is no alternative. This was recognized as early as the late 1960s.
                The purpose of environmental assessment is to improve decisions by

    making appropriate choices, so it follows that careful comparison of
    realistic alternatives is an important feature of environmental assessments.
    Without      systematic    consideration   of   realistic  alternatives,  any
    environmental impact assessment is seriously flawed. The Bank's own
    policies provide for the consideration of alternatives. Paragraph 4c of OD
    4.01 of October 1991 states that project specific EA's should normally
    include: "systematic environmental comparison of alternative investments,
    sites, technologies and designs". Paragraph (f) of Annex B of OD 4.01
    amplifies this: "The EA report should include the following items (f)
    Analysis of alternatives. Systematic comparison of the proposed investment
    design, site, technology and operational alternatives in terms of their
    potential environmental impacts...       For each of the alternatives, the
    environmental costs and benefits should be quantified to the extent possible,
    and economic values should be attached where feasible. The basis for the
    selection of the alternative proposed for the project design must be stated".

61. To ensure that the importance of alternatives is fully understood, Task 5 of
    the Bank's Sample Terms of Reference (TOR) for Environmental
    Assessment states as follows: "Task 5. Analysis of Alternatives to the
    Proposed Project. Describe alternatives that were examined in the course
    of developing the proposed project and identify other alternatives which
    would achieve the same objectives. The concept of alternatives extends to
    siting, design, technology selection, construction techniques and phasing,
    and operating and maintenance procedures. Compare alternatives in terms
    of potential environmental impacts; capital and operating costs; suitability
    under local conditions; and institutional, training, and monitoring
    requirements. When describing the impacts, indicate which are irreversible
    or unavoidable and which can be mitigated. To the extent possible, quantify
    the costs and benefits of each alternative, incorporating the estimated costs
    of any associated mitigating measures. Include the alternative of not
    constructing the project, in order to demonstrate environmental conditions
    without it."

62. The Bank has been involved with water and sewage projects in Colombia
    from the mid 1980's. Since then, there has been controversy in Cartagena as
    to whether it is more desirable to have sewage disposal through an outfall to
    the sea or by means of conventional primary treatment with discharge of
    water to the Ciénaga de la Virgen. Before 1995 ­ when ACUACAR (a
    mixed private-public company created with Bank assistance) was
    established to manage the supply of water, and sewage disposal in
    Cartagena ­ the preferred option appears to have been for primary treatment
    of the city's sewage in stabilization and oxidation lagoons, with discharge




                                    19

                of the effluent into the Ciénaga de la Virgen48. The Panel was informed that
                the Cartagena Municipality initially favored this solution.49


         63.    The Panel reviewed a 1994 study that contains a technical and economic
                evaluation of the marine outfall for the discharge of Cartagena's
                wastewaters (1994 CHS Study).50 According to this document, the
                evaluation was prompted by concerns about the nutrient concentration
                resulting from the use of stabilization ponds that may cause eutrophication
                in the Ciénaga de la Virgen.51 (A feasibility study also carried out by CHS
                in 1985 had recommended the use of stabilization lagoons.) According to
                the 1994 CHS Study, government officials, the World Bank, Cartagena's
                mayor, municipality officials and members of CHS held a meeting in 1993,
                in which they discussed the nutrient concentration problem and agreed to
                review the options of discharging the wastewater through a submarine
                outfall by itself or as a complement of treatment by means of stabilization
                lagoons.   52 The 1994 CHS Study concluded that more studies were required
                if a submarine outfall option ­ with or without lagoon prior treatment ­
                were to be considered.

         64.    The Inspection Panel was also told that the licensing authorities in Bogotá
                had rejected the proposal for oxidation lagoons, and that this had led the
                Bank to propose the consideration of a marine outfall for Cartagena's
                sewage.53 The Aide Memoire related to a February 1998 Bank supervision
                mission indirectly supports this. In addressing issues to discuss with the
                Panel of Experts (POE) appointed in 1998 to review the feasibility of the
                proposed project, the report states "The consultant should present a
                technical and economic comparison of the Bank-proposed project with the
                previously mentioned alternative (oxidation ponds and disposal to
                Ciénaga)."54 In addition, according to this report, "[t]he cost of the land-
                disposal alternative with or without [effluent] storage should be evaluated
                and compared with marine disposal [...]".55 This international POE in
                reviewing the feasibility and technical solutions proposed for Cartagena,
                including the FS, also stated that "[t]he Panel of Experts recommends a

                 change in concept from the Ciénaga receiving discharge to a marine
                 outfall."56

          65.    It is clear that by the mid-1990's the preferred option for Cartagena sewage
                 effluent disposal changed from a land based sewage treatment plant to a
                 marine outfall option.

          66.    The Executive Summary of the FS states that "the wastewater management
                 studies conducted during the 70's, 80's and 90's have recommended
                 constructing a Submarine Outfall, to discharge the treated effluent into the
                 Caribbean Sea."57            The ES also refers to the Sewerage Master Plan
                 originally prepared by the District of Cartagena and updated by local
                 consultants, regulatory agencies, the World Bank and ACUACAR.58 The
                 Executive Summary notes that the recommendations of the Sewerage
                 Master Plan in relation to water quality and the disposal of the effluent,
                 were (1) to eliminate the discharges of wastewater into Cartagena Bay and
                 the Tesca Lagoon; and (2) to plan and build a submarine outfall into the
                 Caribbean to dispose of the City's residential liquid waste. The ES also
                 notes that Hazen and Sawyer, the consultant who prepared the FS, "were
                 selected to review the feasibility of the basic recommendations of the
                 Sewerage Master Plan [...] and outline the works needed to implement the
                 plan.59"

          67.    The Panel notes that the FS does not refer to or explain any change of
                 policy during the 1990s regarding the preferred ways of addressing
                 Cartagena's wastewater problems or to any controversy over the most
                 appropriate solution. In the Panel's view, the absence of explanation about
                 the apparent change from an earlier policy favoring stabilization ponds may
                 have exacerbated a public sense of unease or suspicion about the choice of a
                 submarine outfall.60

          68.    An analysis of the different alternatives considered in the Feasibility Study
                 and the Environmental Assessment follows.




56Memorandum from Panel of Experts dated July 1998. However, in an interview with a member of the
Panel of Experts, the member stated that in all meetings of the Panel the focus had been on a marine outfall
as if the decision that this was the best solution for Cartagena had already been made.

member wrote: "Suggest deleting the map showing settleable solids zone of impact from E.S. This is rather

1.3.1. Disposal Alternatives

         69.    The analysis of alternatives in the FS addresses various combinations of (1)
                treatment levels and (2) effluent disposal locations, against the criteria of
                possible effects on (a) human health, (b) marine environment, (c) natural
                areas, (d) human populations, (e) technical feasibility and (f) cost
                effectiveness.61 The combinations of the factors resulted in 15 alternatives.
                The alternatives were based on future scenarios of 2015 and 2025 with
                discharges of 227,000m3/day and 303,000m3/day, respectively.

         70.    The FS and the EA analyze various disposal alternatives for liquid effluent.
                They consider the various Cartagena water bodies capable of receiving
                sewage effluent: to the north the Ciénaga de la Virgen (or Ciénaga Tesca);
                to the south the Bahia de Cartagena (Cartagena Bay); and to the west the
                Caribbean Sea. As possible alternatives, the studies consider the discharge
                of sewage effluent to each of these receiving waters, as well as the potential
                to use the effluent for irrigation. The documents address the following
                levels of treatment of the wastes before disposal: preliminary, primary,
                secondary, and advanced treatment.

         71.    The FS and EA also address the biological condition of the Bahia, the
                Ciénaga and the ocean area close to Cartagena. They particularly consider
                mangroves, water quality, and pathogens, and consider fish only to a lesser
                extent. In 2003, an inventory of fishing activities in the area likely to be
                affected by the submarine pipeline and special studies of biodiversity was
                undertaken.62

         72.    The Cartagena Bay receives pollution via a channel, the "canal del dique,"
                from the Magdalena River. This river crosses the developed part of
                Colombia and mostly transports pollutants from agriculture and urban and
                industrial sources.63 The Bay also receives the industrial pollution and storm
                water from the city of Cartagena.               An undersea wall constructed by
                governmental authorities during the Spanish colonization reduces the rate at
                which water is exchanged between the sea and the Bay, which affects the
                Bay's capacity to dilute pollutants.

         73.    The Ciénaga de la Virgen is an internal lagoon that forms part of the coastal
                ecosystem of the Cartagena area. It is polluted by domestic waste and storm
                water flow (total solids and overland flow that washes the contaminated
                surfaces) and agriculture. According to the FS, the Project would reduce the

63The Magdalena River is also considered in paragraphs 88 and 89.

                domestic waste into the lagoon but would not eliminate the other sources of
                pollution. The pollution reduction would not be enough to let the Ciénaga
                recover all its environmental functions.64 The Panel of Experts dismissed
                the Ciénaga de Tesca as appropriate for receiving wastes, even if they are
                treated, because it has a low absorptive capacity and is part of an ecosystem
                that needs to be protected.65 (The Bank-financed Project deals only with the
                reduction of the pollutant load, not with the ecosystem recovery.) The
                construction of automatic hydraulic gates, which increases the influx of
                unpolluted sea water into the Ciénaga, has improved the water quality of the
                lagoon by decreasing the residence time of pollutants and increasing its
                dilution capacity. However, the Panel notes that this is not a sustainable
                solution since it transfers the contamination to the coast near the lagoon,
                affecting the beaches.

       74.      The FS also dismisses the land disposal option as a viable solution because
                the use of treated wastewater for agriculture activities would be feasible
                only in summer months only (five months per year), and, according to the
                FS, the storage of the water for reuse would require a substantial amount of
                land near Cartagena.66

       75.      As compared to the selected alternative, the Panel could find only cursory
                consideration to the option of constructing a sewage treatment plant near
                Cartagena, with the waters going to a marine area or alternatively reused for
                agriculture as a supplement to the recommended disposal system.

       76.      The Panel finds that the study of alternatives covered most of the
                alternatives for this type of project and evaluated the basic parameters.
                In this respect, the Panel finds the Bank in compliance with OD 4.01,
                paragraph 4 and Annex B (f). However, the Panel is concerned about
                the diligence with which alternatives other than the preferred
                alternative of submarine outfall were studied. The voluminous
                feasibility study and the environmental assessment, which closely
                follows the feasibility study, give greater attention to the submarine
                outfall than to other options. They do not demonstrate a systematic
                comparative study of all the alternatives as required by OD 4.01.

       77.      The Panel finds that the appointment of a panel of experts to review the
                technical work in the feasibility study and the design of the Project is
                consistent with Bank policies, particularly OD 4.01 paragraph 13, but is
                not convinced that there was a sufficiently thorough analysis of
                alternatives before a decision on the outfall was made.

1.4. The selected option: the submarine outfall

         78.    Management states that the analysis of alternatives led to the selection of a
                submarine outfall as the preferred option to dispose of Cartagena's
                wastewater. The Panel notes that disposal of sewage to sea via a
                submarine outfall is a tried and proven technology which, under
                suitable conditions, offers a low-cost low-maintenance solution for
                acceptable disposal of human wastes.67

         79.    The Panel observes that the Feasibility Study and the Environmental
                Assessment did not address the possible long term environmental and
                health effects on the coastal and marine environment if there were to be
                multiple outfalls in the area and the volume of sewage and organic
                wastes increased significantly so as to exceed the absorptive capacity of
                the marine area. This is an issue that may need to be addressed in the
                future.

         80.    The Project EA includes a diagram outlining seven steps in the outfall-
                decision making process, which were intended to generate a range of
                Project choices in designing a submarine outfall.68

       81.     In response to the Requesters' complaints, the Panel will analyze in detail
               the following aspects of the proposed submarine outfall: (a) the location of
               the outfall; b) the design of the outfall so as to meet the requirements for
               environmental robustness and human contact safety; (b) treatment of the
               wastes before disposal; d) the land conveyance system for the wastes; and
               e) the potential impacts on the locally affected communities in the North
               Zone.

1.4.1. Punta Canoa as the Location for Outfall

       82.     The FS evaluated alternative offshore locations for the marine outfall: (a)
               Oceanfront of the Ciénaga, (b) La Boquilla, (c) Punta Canoa, to the north of
               Cartagena, and (d) Tierra Bomba Island to the south of the city. These
               alternatives were considered in terms of (i) bathymetry, (ii) ocean currents
               and winds, (iii) marine biodiversity, (iv) proximity to coral reefs and sites of
               particular biodiversity, (v) human health, (vi) tourist beaches, (vi) fishing,
               (vii) geology and (viii) cost effectiveness.

       83.     These evaluations, together with two hydrographic dispersion-modeling
               exercises were used to select a site 2.85km offshore from Punta Canoa as
               the preferred location for the marine outfall. Management states that Punta
               Canoa was selected as the outfall site because its very steep bottom sea


                                               25

                slope made it the "least cost alternative."69 Management indicates that the
                steep sea slope allows construction of an outfall that reaches deep water in
                only 2.85km, as opposed to other sites near the city, where reaching the
                same water depth would require a longer outfall of approximately 9km.70 It
                adds that "the combined cost of the onshore and offshore pipes was lowest
                for the Punta Canoa site.71"

         84.    Punta Canoa is a small village located in the North Zone of Cartagena,
                about 20km from the city, which is the home of "established black
                communities that have lived there for at least three generations72" who, as
                the PAD recognizes, live mainly "from fishing".73

         85.    The selection of Punta Canoa as the site for the marine outfall raises several
                issues that are outlined in the Request for Inspection. As already noted, the
                communities living in the North Zone ­ Punta Canoa, Manzanillo del Mar,
                Arroyo de Piedra and La Boquilla ­ are concerned that the outfall will
                contaminate the waters and harm the fish population which, they state, is
                their main source of income and livelihood. The Requesters are also
                concerned about the monitoring and retrofitting measures planned under the
                Project because they believe the former will not provide adequate protection
                and the latter will intervene too late, once harm has already occurred. As the
                PAD describes, they further fear "possible leakage and `explosions' along
                the conveyance pipeline and/or in the pumping stations sites that might
                affect their neighborhoods."74 The Requesters also worry about the
                phenomenon of mud diapirism, which, according to senior community
                leaders, occurred several decades ago in the Punta Canoa area.

         86.    The Panel asked an expert, Prof. Jorg Imberger of the University of Western
                Australia, who has done work in Latin American for many years, to address
                these concerns about the location of the submarine outfall. The Panel's
                report examines the bathymetry of the area, the influence of the Magdalena
                River, the wind, the ocean currents, the design of the proposed outfall and
                the mud diapirism issue. The report of the Panel's expert provides more

              falls off quite rapidly, particularly opposite Punta Canoa, where the outfall
              will be located. This was an important consideration in the selection of the
              proposed site for the outfall.

1.4.1.2. Relevance of Magdalena River

       88.    To appreciate the potential regional influence of the proposed outfall and to
              assess the assimilative capacity of the region, it is useful to compare the
              loads from the proposed outfall to those originating from the Magdalena
              River, which drains most of Colombia and enters the ocean near
              Barranquilla about 100km north of Cartagena. Table 1, which appears in the
              Panel expert's report in Annex B, shows that the impact of the proposed
              outfall compared to the pollution received from the Magdalena River in the
              same area is very small in freshwater input, minimal in nutrient and organic
              load, but comparable in pathogen load. However, it is important to note
              that, when considering pathogens, the concentration is what counts rather
              than the total load. In terms of concentration, the water from the Magdalena
              River is marginally acceptable (approximately equal to upper immersion
              limit), but the concentration of the outfall effluent is 10,000 times too high
              for pathogens and 1,000 times too high in terms of nutrients.

        89. The Magdalena River has one further very important regional
            influence on the outfall design: it produces a stratified water column off
            the coast of Punta Canoa. The strength of the stratification was
            documented as part of the EIA monitoring program. The freshwater
            plume from the Magdalena River (~8,000 m/s3) extends in front of
            Cartagena introducing a strong near surface density stratification. The
            density differences between the surface and bottom water can reach as
            much as 1.8 kgm-3 in the months from March to September.

1.4.1.3. Winds of the Area

        90. The Feasibility Study (FS) presents results from a depth averaged numerical
            model (RMA, Ian King) with different wind fields. The Panel notes that this
            methodology does not capture the possibly important influence of the wind
            on near surface currents in a stratified water column. This influence could
            affect the assessments of the dilution of effluent and hence the risks of
            contamination to the marine and coastal environments. Historical data
            gathered in the FS show that the wind has an "onshore component" for
            about 40% of the time (N, NW, and W) and is "tranquil" for about 25% of
            the time. (See Figures 6- 8 in Annex B of this Report). Speeds for winds
            with an onshore component range from zero to 15m/s. The Panel expert's

                report in Annex B describes the winds in greater detail and their
                implication.

1.4.1.4. Coastal Ocean Currents

         91.    Ocean currents in the area are available from a number of current meters.
                The FS deployed an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) for an
                extensive period at a number of sites, including at the proposed outfall
                location.76 From the beginning of December to the end of May the ocean
                water at Punta Canoa flows south-west with a mean velocity of around 0.2
                m/s. In the period from the beginning of June to the end of November the
                water flows north-east with a velocity of about 0.2 m/s. The data used in
                the FS and additional studies77 for the design of the outfall were depth
                averaged over the bottom 15m and did not include the velocities in the
                upper 5m. The Panel's expert noted that the currents in the top 5m, the
                stratified upper layer of surface water, were not considered. This omission
                has consequences during periods where the water column currents are
                relatively weak and the water column is stratified, because under such
                conditions the stratification suppresses vertical mixing of the surface plume
                water and allows the surface water to "slip" over the top of the stratified
                layers. This, together with an onshore wind, has the potential for sweeping
                the surface effluent plume onto shore. This issue needs further clarification.

         92.    The Panel notes that in terms of assimilative capacity, the Punta Canoa
                coastal waters could be a suitable site for an outfall if necessary
                precautionary measures are taken in the design of the outfall to ensure
                proper dilution of the effluent so that nutrients are at an acceptable
                level, and to ensure decay of pathogens to a level safe for human
                contact. According to the Panel expert's calculation, the outfall in that
                location should produce at least a dilution of 1:1,000 in order to produce
                acceptable nutrient levels and have a decay rate for pathogens of at least
                1:10.

1.4.3. The proposed design of the submarine outfall

         93.    The Project design provides that wastewater would be collected and
                transported via trunk sewers to the Paraíso pumping station. According to
                the PAD, the wastewater would be pumped from the Paraíso pumping
                station to the treatment plant site through an 18km conveyance system.78

76Feasibility Study, Hazen and Sawyer, 1998.
77Feasibility Study, Hazen and Sawyer, 1998, see also P.G. Roberts, `Dilution Modeling for the Cartagena
Ocean Outfall", 2003, P. G. Roberts, `Additional Water Quality Modeling for the Cartagena Ocean
Outfall', 2004.
78The exact length of the main conveyance system is not clear to the Panel. While the detailed Project
description in the PAD states that the pipeline from Paraíso pumping station to the treatment plant site is
18km long and the effluent pipeline from the treatment plant to the submarine outfall at the Caribbean
shoreline is 2.85km long (PAD, p. 40, 41) for a total length of 22.85km, the Loan Agreement states that the


                                                     29

                 The wastewater would be subject to preliminary treatment, which removes
                 floatable materials, grease, oil, sand, and grits, prior to its discharge to the
                 Caribbean Sea. The effluent would then be transported through a gravity-
                 based conveyance system (of the same diameter as the pressure pipe, i.e.,
                 72") to the outfall. The total outfall length would be 2.850km and the
                 discharge point (diffuser area) would be submerged at a depth of 20m.79
                 The total number of discharge ports would be 54 with a combined flow rate
                 of 3.9m3s-1.

         94.     The Panel notes that the proposed outfall design is based on extensive
                 analysis and modeling. The climate and oceanographic data were used as
                 input to two-dimensional computer models to simulate the diffusion
                 patterns from the submarine outfall.80 The greater the distance of the
                 outfall's point of emission from the shoreline, the deeper the point of
                 emission, and the larger the number of discharge points and the greater the
                 dilution of the effluent­with consequent reductions in most, if not all,
                 indices of potential contamination.

         95.     Marine outfalls achieve their effectiveness by two principles, dilution and
                 increased residence time of the effluent before affecting either the coastal
                 margin, a marine protected area or an area used for recreation or fishing.
                 Typically, an outfall configuration is designed to use both actions to address
                 the safe disposal of different classes of pollutants in a domestic sewage
                 effluent.

         96.     Outfall models are used to estimate the shortest distances from a shoreline
                 and the minimum depth of emission that will be required to meet
                 predetermined standards. All models make assumptions and if these are
                 changed or deemed inappropriate the results from any model can be
                 questioned. Greater margins of safety for prevention of possible shoreline
                 contamination can always be achieved by having longer and deeper
                 submarine outfalls­at greater cost.

         97.     As discussed earlier in this report, the models were made under the
                 assumption that the water column in the area of the outfall was well mixed
                 vertically. The FS and additional studies81 came to the conclusion that the


total length of the wastewater conveyance system is 23.85km (Loan Agreement, Schedule 2, Part C). In
addition, the Feasibility Study states that the land conveyance system will be 20.85km long. The submarine
outfall, which is not a part of the main conveyance system, is consistently defined as 2.85km.
79The diffuser would have a length of 540 m, with a riser spacing of 20 m, for a total of 27 risers. Each
riser would be made of a 12" diameter pipe, 2 m long. The upper end of each riser pipe would be sealed by
a welded plate, and would have 2 openings close to the plate, each of 8"diameter.

                 initial dilution, due the action of the rising buoyant jet, would range from 84
                 (no cross current) to 860 (for cross currents of magnitude 0.2ms-1).

          98.    The Panel notes that in order to design an outfall with an appropriate
                 treatment of wastes, it is important to know the characteristics of the waste
                 to be disposed and its impacts on the sea. Possible pollutants include
                 pathogens, nutrients, organics, and synthetic organics.

          99.    Pathogens,82 the first class of pollutants, measured by means of indicator
                 species such as total (or fecal) coliforms, occur in raw effluents in
                 concentrations of about 1011 counts m-3. In order to be safe for human
                 contact their concentration must, in general, be reduced to 107 counts m-3, a
                 reduction of 104.      83  This may be achieved by bringing the effluent water
                 close to the ocean water surface so that sunlight can kill the pathogens after
                 the effluent has been diluted by the action of the outfall diffuser.

          100. Nutrients, the second class, lead to enrichment of the receiving waters.84
                 The concentrations must be diluted close to the background levels in a
                 contained area.

          101. Organic load, the third class, can draw down the oxygen levels in the
                 surrounding waters to undesirable levels. Typically, untreated effluent has a
                 BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand or the loss of oxygen concentration in 5
                 days) of around 100mg/l.85

          102. Synthetics Organics, which are sometimes found in domestic effluent, refer
                 to a large number of substances, such as pesticides, herbicides and
                 hormones. The latter has received attention most recently receiving
                 attention, because they interrupt the natural genetic balance of secondary
                 products, including fish.

          103. The project design assumed that pathogens decayed by a factor of 10 every
                 2 hours (Hazen and Sawyer, Fig 1). For this to occur, neglecting the dilution
                 effect, the effluent plume water must be brought to the ocean surface and
                 remain in direct sunlight for a period of 8 hours before affecting either the

82 A pathogen is a microbial species that can cause disease under certain conditions. Common exa mples of
bacterial pathogens are Shigella (dysentery) and Salmonella (gastronintestinal disease). The risk of
contracting a disease from a pathogen depends on different factors, such the method of exposure or
transmission, the concentration, incubation period and the age and health condition of the infected person.

84Nutrients are abundant in domestic waste. Although not harmful, too much nutrients in rivers or coastal
waters usually leads to over fertilization and eutrophication (excessive growth of micro-organisms, plants
or higher organisms that can cause actual danger). See Strategy Options for Sewage Management to Protect
the Marine Environment, commissioned by UNEP/GPA, The Hague Netherlands, 7.
85High BOD levels in natural waters can result in death of fish and anaerobic conditions which in turn
result in release of bad odors ­ from Strategy Options for Sewage Management to Protect the Marine

                 Punta Canoa shore area or the traditional fishing areas of the Afro-
                 Columbian community. These data are reproduced in the Panel Expert's
                 report in the Annex B.

          104. The Panel notes that the decay rate is a strong function of light intensity,
                 temperature and salinity, which are not detailed in the reports. The
                 temperature and salinity do not vary greatly at the site under consideration,
                 but the light intensity does. The Panel's expert noted that in general the
                 cumulative death of pathogens is a function of total irradiance and that it
                 has been shown that pathogens that normally require 8 hours of constant
                 sunlight of the intensity found at the site require closer to 72 hours
                 immersion in the surface layer before being reduced by the required factor
                 of 10,000, a ten fold decay in 18 hours. The light extinction effect needs to
                 be considered.86

          105. The Panel notes the model used was based on a turbulent dispersion
                 diffusion coefficient and the assumption that the water column was well
                 mixed vertically. The Panel observes that the calculations performed as far
                 as the near field dilution is concerned are accurate. However, preliminary
                 calculations by the Panel's expert suggest that by not adequately
                 considering the near surface stratification and by being overly optimistic
                 about the rate of decay of pathogens, the far field analysis may not be
                 reliable.    The proposed outfall design may not produce the necessary
                 dilution for the nutrient and organic loads and would not be far enough from
                 the shoreline to ensure the necessary decay of pathogens. The Panel notes
                 that according to the Panel's expert's preliminary calculation, the proposed
                 outfall design may not achieve safe disposal of the effluent and meet safe
                 pathogen standards close to 75% of the time.87 The Panel expert's report
                 appears in Annex B to this report.

          106. In order to ensure that appropriate models had been used by the consultants
                 and to determine the cost-effectiveness of the proposed outfall design the
                 Bank required that a Panel of Experts be retained to "provide advice on
                 technical design, technology, dispersion modeling and construction
                 methods", as well as to "review technical studies, participate in public

86  The Panel notes that according to its Expert, other factors that strongly influence decay rates of
pathogens are missing in the analysis/studies carried out during Project preparation. These include recent
evidence that under some conditions, coliforms grow in the water column rather than die, and new evidence
that fecal and total coliform are not good indicator species when pathogens such as cryptosporidium are
present. The latter organisms can be very dangerous to human health and show much more resistance to
decay than the coliforms. The Panel observes that these points have only recently been documented and so
it is reasonable to assume that Hazen and Sawyer may not have been aware of these complications. For
details, see Prof. Imberger's report in Annex B.
87 According to the expert, preliminary feasibility calculations suggest that a diffuser at Punta Canoa
extending 7000m offshore to a depth of 60m with 152 ports would provide a satisfactory solution with safe
disposal of the nutrient, organic and pathogen load. The expert cautions that these preliminary feasibility
calculations would have to be verified, as by running a fully coupled hydrodynamic -pathogen three
dimensional regional model with an embedded diffuser algorithm.

                CARDIQUE."88 This is consistent with paragraph 13 of OD 4.01, which
                provides that for major projects with serious and multi-dimensional
                environmental concerns "the borrower should normally engage an advisory
                panel of independent, international recognized, environmental specialists to
                advise" inter alia on the Terms of Reference (TORs) and methods of
                preparation of the EA, and to discuss the EA's recommendations and
                findings and their implementation.89 The reports from the Panel of Experts
                reflect that they met on six occasions and commented on the design of the
                proposed submarine outfall. There is no indication that they disagreed at
                the time with the choice of model or with the assumptions under which it
                was run. Subsequent interviews with some members of the Panel of Experts
                have confirmed that certain factors enumerated above (e.g. water column
                stratification and action of onshore winds) were not fully considered. They
                viewed the likely risk posed by these factors as low, and there was concern
                about costs in designing the Project.

         107. The Panel is aware that no consensus exists as to whether the risk is
                high or low that disposal of the effluent under current outfall design
                will not be safe. Bank Management relied on a robust two dimensional
                model to assess risk of contamination near shore from the outfall, and
                used field data taken over an extended period of time. The Panel notes
                that, while the necessary ocean modeling studies were conducted, the
                methodology used did not capture the possibly important influence of
                the wind on near surface currents in a stratified water column. This
                influence could affect the assessments of the dilution of effluent and
                hence the risks of contamination to the marine and coastal
                environments.

         108. The Panel finds that if a three-dimensional model, rather than two
                dimensional, were used to assess risk, the diffusion patterns and
                estimates of shoreline concentrations might be different and that
                greater certainty regarding the risk could be secured.                     90 The results
                could affect the distance from the shore and the depth required for safe
                disposal of Cartagena wastes.

         109. The Panel notes that after a first bidding process that resulted in costs

90Although it may be argued that the use of three-dimensional models will require numerous assumptions
as to boundary conditions and that the results of such models are as dependent on the assumed boundary
conditions as they are on actual field data, the Panel's outfall expert recommends verifying the feasibility
calculations. According to him, these calculations should be now verified with a fully coupled
hydrodynamic-pathogen three dimensional regional model with an embedded diffuser algorithm. He
suggests that an appropriate model could be ELCOM -CAEDYM, an open source model available for
download. See Annex B of this Report for a mo re complete discussion on this subject matter.

                estimate, new specifications are being prepared calling for the use of
                High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) for the construction of the outfall.
                According to Management, this alternative should result in lower costs
                because, unlike reinforced concrete pipes, HDPE pipes would not have to
                be trenched in the bottom of the sea over all its length but only in the surf
                zone. Analysis of the original bids showed that the cost of trenching was
                very high and now should be partially saved.91

         110. The Panel notes that HDPE pipes are proven and widely used for pipelines
                carrying water and sewage both underground and under water in most parts
                of the world. HDPE pipes have advantages: flexibility, easily welded and
                repaired, able to be pulled or floated into position; long life-spans, and not
                as subject to corrosion as concrete or steel pipes. The Panel's experts have
                expressed some concerns about the proposed solution, however, because
                these HDPE pipes have until recently been of fairly small diameter (less
                than 36 inches), and they are not certain about how well established the
                manufacturing techniques are for larger diameters such as the proposed 72
                inch for this outfall.92 Also, the pipe would have to be well anchored onto
                the sea floor as both a pipe of this diameter and the effluent it carries would
                have a density less than sea water, making the pipes buoyant in sea water.
                Some sort of anchoring would be required if the pipes are not to be buried
                below the seabed. By not burying the pipeline, there could be a danger that,
                it will scour over certain span lengths and this could lead to pipe ruptures.
                Pipe scour is a well known phenomenon and has caused many problems in
                the gas industry. Whether a pipeline will scour and hang free depends on
                the soils material, the ocean current regimes and the periodicity of the
                currents. The Panel hopes that proper design and specifications will be able
                to deal with all of these issues.93

1.4.3.1. The risk of diapirism (mud volcanism)

         111. The Requesters claim that the site selected for the marine outfall is
                geologically sensitive.        They believe that this represents a major
                environmental risk of the Project. According to the Requesters, "the area
                around Punta Canoa and Arroyo de Piedra is subject to diapirism, also
                known as mud volcanism. This phenomenon is characterised by the sudden,
                violent expulsion of thousands of cubic metres of mud, clay and gases. A




91Management Memorandum to the Inspection Panel, June 20, 2005, [hereinafter "Management
Memorandum, June 20, 2005"].
92According to the original bidding document for the submarine outfall, several manufacturers of this type
of pipes had informed the Bank and ACUACAR that they expected to be able to manufacture a 72inch
(1800mm) polyethylene pipe in 2004.
93Management's June 20, 2005 Memorandum refers to a bidding process for a similar marine pipeline of
3km length and 1600mm diameter in Ashkelon, Israel, but notes that the pipeline will be "completely
trenched in the sea bed."


                                                   34

               geological event [of this nature] could rupture the line without warning at
               any time and cause waste water to be released much closer to the shore."94

       112. The Requesters argue that the Bank did not consider that a geological event
               could have potential harmful impacts on the outfall pipeline, thus on the
               environment, the health and safety of the villages of Punta Canoa, Arroyo
               de Piedra and Manzanillo del Mar.95 They claim that INGEOMINAS, the
               Colombian Institute for Geology and Mining, had warned about the
               diapirism risks in a Seminar on Geoenvironmental Risks held in Cartagena
               in 2000. According to the Request, INGEOMINAS' experts "announced
               that no engineering design could provide an outfall that could withstand the
               effects of a submarine explosion like those that have already occurred in the
               Caribbean near Punta Canoa." In light of this, the Requesters allege that
               "[t]he complete failure of those preparing and approving the EA to
               recognize and discuss this potentially grave geological and environmental
               risk renders the EA an incomplete and highly misleading report."96 In their
               view "the Bank has done nothing to correct it or make sure the
               precautionary principle it promotes is followed."97

       113. Management Response states that not only did the FS and EA analyze the
               issue, but additional studies were conducted by Marine Resources Inc. and
               an expert hired by ACUACAR. These studies confirmed the conclusions of
               the EA and the FS that the risk of diapirism, or mud volcanism, in the area
               is low "because there is an absence of large magnitude seismic activity and
               magnetic [sic] volcanism."98 Management adds that in the course of the
               licensing process, CARDIQUE reviewed the Marine Resources study and
               agreed with the findings, although it recommended that the District of
               Cartagena take the low geological risk into account in the technical
               specifications for the outfall.99

       114. The Bank policy on Environmental Assessment requires that all the
               environmental consequences of a Project be assessed early in the project
               cycle and taken into account in the Project design to prevent, minimize,
               mitigate or compensate for Project adverse impacts100.

       115. Diapirism is the upward­and sometimes sideward­movement of less dense
               sediments through denser materials due to buoyancy forces.                  Mud
               volcanism is not equivalent to the more familiar volcanic eruptions
               involving molten lava. The occurrence of surface extrusion of mudflows in
               the vicinity of Punta Canoa is well known and was a factor considered from

                 the first stages of project design101 and subsequently investigated further
                 through geophysical testing102 and by seeking the opinion of an expert on
                 diapirism in this location103.

          116. The 2000 Geophysical Investigations conducted by the Marine Resources
                 mention that "mud diapers are a common feature around the study area"
                 which is "located just offshore a headland known as Punta Canoa."104 The
                 study states that it identified a diapiric feature (line 04) of 250m diameter
                 about 300m southwest of the proposed pipeline.105 It adds that this was the
                 "only diapiric feature in over 25km" of collected data. The Marine
                 Resources study also mentions that historical records of Punta Canoa
                 document one other diapirism event occurred in the area.106

          117. The conclusion of the Marine Resources' study is that in general terms
                 "These features [mud diapers] are of moderate concern in terms of potential
                 geologic hazard.107" The study adds that "the low density and small sizes of
                 these features in the immediate area indicates that they have a limited
                 spatial influence."108 With respect Punta Canoa, site specific investigations
                 of the proposed outfall site found that "The line 04 diapir, even if
                 reactivated, is of sufficient distance from the proposed outfall that no
                 deformation would occur in the area of the proposed pipeline. Sediment
                 generated from the outflow cone of a mud diapir appears to be limited to
                 the immediate area overlying the deformation zone."109

          118. To grant the environmental license for the Project CARDIQUE reviewed
                 the Marine Resources' study. While agreeing with the general conclusion
                 that the risk of diapirism is small, it nevertheless required that a contingency
                 plan be developed to address the situation in the event of mud-diapirism
                 affecting the pipeline.110

          119. An expert hired by ACUACAR, Dr. George Vernette, also reviewed the
                 conclusions of the Feasibility Study pertaining to geological conditions, and
                 confirmed that the risk diapirism poses to the pipeline is small.111                   He

               wrote: "I was surprised that diapirism is a matter of such great concern.
               The risk that could result from this phenomenon is really minimal."112

         120. The Vernette Report concluded that, based on available data and
               information about the area, diapirism is a phenomenon of small
               extension.113 According to this study, mud volcanism events may indeed
               occur in the area between the Magdalena River's mouth in the Sea and the
               Darien Gulf.114 The report cited a mud diapirism event that occurred in
               1996 and stated that the area of influence of the mud volcanism was about
               200m, while the indirect effect on soil fracturing was about 600m.115
               Vernette also discussed a further diapiric event allegedly occurred in 1979
               off the coast of Punta Canoa, whereby, following a big earthquake, an
               island made of mud/clay appeared in the sea and disappeared fifteen days
               later as a result of the surf. After examining a picture of this island and the
               site where it allegedly appeared, Vernette concluded that this mud diapirism
               event was an anomaly, because it was the only event of the kind detected in
               the area. He added nonetheless that the island emerged "more than 2km far
               from the route of the proposed outfall."116

         121. Based on the geological and geophysics studies conducted in the Project
               area, the Vernette report concluded that the Project's system of conduits in
               land and the outfall in the sea are outside the area of influence of these
               known diapiric events (at least 1km in the ocean and 5km in the land117).
               Thus, according to Vernette, "it can be correctly assumed that clay
               diapirism should not directly affect the route of the planned outfall."118

         122. The above-mentioned studies present two technical evaluations of the
               problem based on collected data from the area. In addition, INGEOMINAS
               staff interviewed by the Panel during its visits to the Project area mentioned
               that there seems to be a mud volcano about 300m from the proposed outfall.
               During its visit to the Project area, affected people from Punta Canoa that
               the Panel team met referred to the 1979 diapiric event and the island
               emerged in the sea. An eye witness account of the eruption near Punta
               Canoas was related to the Panel as "an island had formed overnight, which
               was washed away over a period of weeks."

salir de una anomalía, puesto que es el único evento detectado por la sísmica realizada en este sector. Es
de anotar que se encuentra a mas de 2.0 kilómetros del trazado del Emisario propuesto." The Panel was
also informed about this occurrence during its visits to the Project area.

          123. The Panel notes that the Vernette study found no evidence that diapirism
                 vents are located near the proposed Punta Canoa site and the detailed
                 bathymetry survey obtained from CIOH shows no sign of submerged
                 mounds in the bathymetry. The Panel finds that the potential for the
                 pipeline to be ruptured or otherwise significantly disturbed by
                 diapirism appears to be low.

          124. However, given that the study found a mud volcano in the outfall area that
                 has been estimated as close as about 300 meters from the proposed outfall,
                 it may be reassuring to clarify what distance is "a safe distance" from the
                 mud volcanism. The Panel notes that a side scan sonar survey of the
                 surface of an area of 25km was done as part of the above-mentioned
                 Geophysical Investigations.119 It may be useful to have a side scan sonar
                 survey of the proposed outfall trajectory to map the subsurface soil
                 structure to a depth of low frequency sonar penetration to reduce any
                 remaining uncertainty regarding the possibility of a diapirism
                 extending to the outfall, and to publish the results.

1.4.4. Level of Treatment and Ultimate Disposal

          125. All sewage treatment systems must ultimately dispose of both water and
                 solids (sludge). The options for disposal depend to a high degree on the
                 extent to which effluent has been treated and purified prior to discharge. As
                 the methods of treatment are additive, installation costs increase as more
                 levels of treatment are added. Treatment alternatives120 are considered in the
                 analysis of alternatives undertaken in the feasibility study.121


119 Marine Resources, p. 12.
120 Preliminary treatment removes large and heavy solid materials from sewage. Screens trap these items
while grit chambers remove sand, gravel and heavy inorganic matter. Oil and grease and other floating
compounds are skimmed from the effluent. Only about 10% of oxygen consuming waste is removed and
virtually no nutrients or pathogens. Preliminary and Primary treatment are frequently combined into a
single stage of sewage treatment. Solid residues from the process must ideally be disposed of in a properly
constructed and managed sanitary landfill site.
Primary treatment removes about 30% of organic oxygen consuming waste as from sewage. Bacterial
counts are also reduced to about half of their pre -treatment numbers. Treatment consists mainly of
allowing sewage to stand or move slowly through settling and oxygenation ponds. The solid residue
(sludge) from the process is dried and either used as compost or burned. Primary treatment is the most
common form of sewage treatment before effluent is discharged. The receiving waters should have a high
assimilative capacity: near the outfall the receiving waters should not be used for recreation or human
consumption.
Secondary treatment is common in developed countries. After either the activated sludge or trickling
filter process some 85 to 90% of solids and oxygen consuming wastes are removed from the waste stream.
The resulting effluent is discharged to a receiving water body; most usually a river or the ocean. Although
the receiving waters close to the outfall should not be used for human consumption recreational use of the
water body is possible. The solid residue (sludge) from the process is dried and used as compost or burned.
Tertiary treatment: after tertiary treatment effluent water can be used for industrial purposes, to irrigate
golf courses, city parks, crops and animal pastures without danger to public health. After tertiary treatment
less than 1% of nutrients and oxygen consuming compounds remain in the water and pathogens are reduced
to negligible counts. Tertiary treatment of sewage effluent is not common, even in rich countries.


                                                       38

         126. The Panel notes that to safeguard human health, the greater the level of
                  treatment prior to discharge to the sea the better. Preliminary treatment is
                  better than no treatment, primary better than preliminary and secondary
                  treatment would be better than primary. However, the Panel notes that costs
                  increase significantly with greater levels of treatment.                    In addition,
                  allowance for possible future upgrading of treatment prior to ocean disposal
                  underlies the decision not to undertake treatment at the site of the Paraíso
                  pumping station and to develop a treatment site near Punta Canoa.122

         127. According to Management, the analysis of various levels of treatment
                  alternatives led to the selection of a marine outfall with preliminary
                  treatment. As Bank staff told the Panel, the basis for the decision was cost-
                  effectiveness without undue risk to human health or the environment. It
                  may be argued, however, that the decision as to whether wastewater will be
                  subject to primary, secondary or tertiary treatment should be made before
                  deciding where the water will be discharged. In effect, the two decisions are
                  closely inter-related with feedback occurring between them.

         128. Management Response refers to a study published by the Pan-American
                  Health Organization123 (2000) and to one published by the WHO (2003),124
                  which assert that submarine outfalls and preliminary treatment are sound
                  solutions with low impact. They are often used in Latin America.125 The
                  PAHO (2000) study presented 84 examples of outfalls in Puerto Rico,
                  Mexico and other Latin American countries, with 17 of these outfalls
                  having a discharge depth greater than 20m, which is the depth proposed for
                  the outfall off Punta Canoa. The Panel observes that the study does not
                  provide monitoring data for the outfalls. Rather it shows the date the
                  outfalls were constructed and the treatment provided at that time. The data
                  indicate that for outfalls constructed after 1979 with a discharge of 20m or
                  more in depth, all but two have been built with primary or secondary
                  treatment of wastes.126 The two exceptions are in Venezuela, where no
                  treatment has been required.127


With further chemical, radiation and gas treatments the discharge water can be safely input to human
drinking water supplies: this is rarely done except in exceptionally water-stressed locations.

126The study shows no marine outfalls constructed in Brazil after 1975.
127The database on outfalls at the University of Karlsruhe lists the Venezuelan outfall shown in the PAHO
study as still in process as commissioned in 2003, with no treatment of waste required. See

       129. Figure II-3 below suggests the trends in the level of treatment associated
             with the construction of submarine outfalls more generally. It shows that the
             percentage of submarine outfalls designed for discharge of untreated wastes
             has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those designed with
             primary treatment has increased significantly. The Panel notes that the
             Colombian licensing authorities for the outfall for the Cartagena wastes
             have required that the wastes be subject to primary treatment after 10 years.

1.4.5. The land conveyance system: overland route, pumping stations and treatment
plant locations

1.4.5.1. Evaluation of alternatives

       130. Four significantly different overland routes between the Paraíso pumping
             station and the sea were identified from aerial photographs and field
             observations. Variations on each of these routes gave rise to a total of 21
             corridors that were compared to each other via a scoring system. The
             criteria for semi-quantitative comparison were: technical considerations



                                                                              40

                (difficulty of construction, accessibility); environmental factors (impact on
                five categories of wetlands, water level fluctuations, areas of special
                interest); socio-political considerations (duration of construction activities,
                proximity to habitations, disruption to traffic and communications, degree
                of public acceptance).

        131. Alternatives at the Paraíso pumping station and at the treatment works near
                Punta Canoa were also evaluated. The locations of the pumping station and
                the treatment works were determined in part by the availability of land to
                allow for future expansion and additional treatment facilities.

        132. The Panel finds that for the selected option of a submarine outfall, the
                analysis of the alternatives for the land conveyance systems, liquid
                disposal locations and pipeline corridors, in terms of their potential
                health and environmental impacts, meets the OD 4.01 requirement that
                alternatives be considered. Bank staff have exercised due diligence in
                considering alternatives and mitigation measures and have complied
                with OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.

1.4.5.2. The overland pipeline design

        133. The overland conveyance system, as designed, consists of a pipeline of
                1.80m (72in) in diameter and 20.85km in length, split up in two stretches.
                The first section of the pipeline extends from the Paraíso pumping station
                18km128 north to the wastewater treatment plant. The second tract will
                transport the treatment plant effluent 2.85km to the shore of Punta Canoa,
                from where the submarine outfall stretches out 2.85km into the Caribbean
                Sea. The Panel understands that early in the review of the design of the
                outfall, the issue of a need for two parallel pipelines was raised but not
                pursued for reasons of economy. The Panel did not find evidence that the
                costs and benefits of a second pipeline were systematically explored.

        134. The system as designed provides for pumping of effluent from the Paraíso
                station at Cartagena, where the wastes are gathered, to the preliminary
                treatment site at Punta Canoa. The wastes will be transported by gravity
                from the site of the preliminary treatment plant to the sea.

        135. The Panel notes that a land pipeline conveying the waste to Punta Canoa
                and thence to the marine area is subject to the risk of rupture, intentional or
                accidental, and to other disabling events, such as disruptions of electrical
                service. The contingency manual, developed under the Project, presents a
                review of these risks and the ways to deal with each of them.129 However,


128See PAD, p. 40.
129The Project's Contingency Plan outlines the actions that ACUACAR shall carry out in case of major
problems with the pipes of the land conveyance system or the submarine outfall. The Plan shall also be
implemented only in cases of major failures in the system that would cause wastewater discharge in the
Ciénaga, in the Caribbean Sea or in other areas where such problems would put public health at risk. The


                                                    41

                 after reviewing the contingency manual, the Panel remains concerned about
                 the adequacy of the planning for emergencies.

         136. With respect to the design of the pressure pipe, records examined by the
                 Panel do not clarify whether the Paraíso pumping station system provides
                 for a storage area in case of emergencies. During its visit to the Project area,
                 the Panel was shown drawings and plans of the pipeline and noted that
                 while a storage area has been planned, the Contingency Plan Manual does
                 not mention it. The Panel notes that in case of operation failure because of
                 lack of energy or other potential problems along the land conveyance,
                 without the storage area the waste will flow to the Ciénaga de la Virgen and
                 will have an odor impact in the neighborhoods where the Paraíso Station is
                 located. The Panel notes that the Panel of Experts and the environmental
                 assessment emphasized the importance of a storage area as well.130

         137. The Panel also observes that waste leakage from the pipeline could
                 contaminate both surface and ground water resources. The Panel finds that
                 this issue was neither analyzed in the 1999 EA nor included in the
                 Environment Management Plan. The Panel finds that ground water
                 monitoring is important in order to identify leakage and actions to
                 mitigate it.

         138. The Panel of Experts raised the issue of odor control. In a letter addressed
                 to ACUACAR, Hazen and Sawyer discuss the possibility of odors
                 emanating from the treatment plant and indicated that there are four
                 available options to deal with this problem.            131  Option A would "postpone
                 any installation of odor collection," and "design a closed system" because
                 "[d]ue to the isolated location of the treatment plant, the offsite odor impact
                 may be acceptable for many years until local development occurs." Under
                 option B a compost pile scrubber system would be installed. According to
                 Hazen and Sawyer, this would be a simple and inexpensive proposition,
                 although "odor treatment is marginal to good." Option C would provide for
                 a single stage chemical odor treatment system, by which "most odors are
                 removed," while option D would entail a "two-stage odor chemical control
                 system which provides excellent odor control performance." No cost
                 indication is given for these last two options. According to Hazen and
                 Sawyer, the World Bank decided to encourage the postponement of "any

plan indicates which events trigger its activation: general or major failures including damage to the pipes,
the electric system or the overall structure of the Paraíso pumping station or the treatment plant; and major
breaks of the land conveyance system or the marine outfall caused by, inter alia, telluric movements, other
geological events and sabotage. The contingency plan includes the following sub-plans: Information to the
public; Notification to authorities; Emergency plan for control of the wastewater flow; Administrative
action; Emergency operational plan; Training program; Emergency monitoring plan; and Information for
public access.

                installation for odor control/treatment works" "due to project cost
                constraints." The Panel notes that according to the Hazen and Sawyer's
                letter "the odor control treatment costs are not included in the project
                budget." The Panel notes that the PAD does not mention odor treatment.
                However, the Panel also reviewed the bidding documents related to the
                construction of the treatment plant and notes that they include specifications
                for an odor treatment system at the treatment plant as well as at the Paraíso
                pumping station.

         139. With respect to the selection of pipe materials the Inspection Panel was
                variously informed132 that: (1) both on-shore and submarine portions of the
                pipeline would consist of reinforced concrete pipes; (2) that the on-shore
                pipes would be reinforced concrete but that no decision had yet been made
                with respect to the submarine pipes; (3) that selection of pipe materials is at
                the discretion of contractors bidding for the work and was yet to be decided.

1.4.5.3. Disposal of Sludge

         140. The Terms of Reference for the Environmental Assessment require that
                sludge disposal be considered.133 However, the Panel notes that this appears
                to have escaped attention in the final report.134 The Panel interviews
                conducted in fall 2004 with staff135 of both ACUACAR and the Bank were
                inconclusive as to whether adequate attention had been given to sludge
                disposal. During the field visit, the Panel was informed that the problem
                had yet to be addressed and it was variously suggested that sludge would be
                disposed of either in a yet to be constructed landfill for Cartagena or in
                landfill sites to be constructed on the ground acquired for the treatment
                plant, (allegedly only a small site being required as the volume of solids
                would be less than 10m3 per day). Following the Panel's request for
                additional information on this subject, Management informed the Panel that
                "given the small magnitude of the solid waste generated by the plant, and
                the low level of potential impacts, (...) solid waste management was not
                specifically addressed in the loan agreement nor was it deeply dealt with
                during project preparation, but rather thoroughly addressed during
                implementation."136

         141. Management also stated that a solids waste management plan as well as a
                report on the plan was to be prepared for submission to CARDIQUE, the

132Hazen and Sawyer, letter to ACUACAR, (Subject: Preliminary Treatment Process Cartagena,
Colombia) May 3, 2000.
133Paragraph 8 (iii) of the Terms of reference for the Evaluación Ambiental.
134A Bank memorandum dated December 21, 1995 recommends inter alia that the Environmental
Assessment should address the question of sludge disposal in a landfill and that the project might usefully
support such disposal facilities.

                 environmental authority, in January 2005. According to Management, the
                 new plan provides that the solid waste be compacted at the treatment plant
                 and then hauled to a landfill.137 Management states that this is a legal
                 landfill operated by the firm Ingeambiente under a license issued by
                 CARDIQUE.138 Specifically, the solids from wastewater treatment are to be
                 transported 17km north of Cartagena to the La Paz Regional Landfill in the
                 municipality of Turbana, in the Bolivar Department. Before being
                 transported to the landfill site, the waste is to be stored for a number of
                 hours in hermetic containers. Transport then occurs in hermetic conditions
                 to avoid leaks in the road and problems for the communities. Management
                 states that this process is in compliance with the Ministry of Environment
                 resolution No. 541 of 1998.139

          142. The Panel finds that the Project environmental studies did not consider
                 alternatives for the disposal of the solids recovered during the
                 preliminary treatment of the sewage stream. In this respect,
                 Management was not in compliance with OD 4.01. The Panel further
                 notes that although Management now asserts that a plan exists for the
                 disposal of sludge, the Panel has not been able to find a consideration of
                 alternatives for the disposal of sludge as required before finalizing a
                 plan, as required by Bank policies.

1.4.5. The monitoring program

          143. The Requesters argue that the EA "ignored the preference" of the Bank
                 policy on Environmental Assessment for preventive measures, and adopted
                 a "`wait and see' monitoring and retrofitting approach."140 According to
                 the Request, "simply monitoring bacteria levels (...) will not provide
                 adequate protection against potentially life-threatening pollution."141 They
                 add that retrofitting the system will require installation of new treatment
                 facilities, with "significant" financial implications.142 In addition, the
                 Requesters believe that "[b]y the time any retrofit might be put into place,
                 the outfall would have taken a huge toll on human health, the marine
                 environment, and the general well being of these affected communities."143

          144. Management responds that, as designed, the outfall, "provides adequate
                 protection against harmful bacteria from the waste flow reaching nearby


137Management Memorandum, December 13, 2004. The memo states that "the quantities of solid waste
that will be generated in the Cartagena plant will be 14 m3/d at the initial stage of operation and 24 m3/d at
final stage (after 20 years), which means about one truck per day at first stage and 2 trucks at final stage."

              beaches."144 Management claims that precautionary measures, such as
              chlorination installations and addition of coagulants to the raw wastewater
              prior to entry to the treatment plant, have been included in the design of the
              treatment plant. The Project provides also for a contingency plan to collect,
              treat and dispose of the wastewater. The Response also states that the
              intensive monitoring referred to by the Requesters has been required under
              the Environmental License issued by CARDIQUE, as a precautionary
              measure and for gathering information for the second stage of the Project.145

       145. Monitoring "before and after construction of the marine outfall to study the
              fate of pathogenic coliforms and other contaminants discharged through the
              outfall" is part of the Project's Component G (Environmental and Social
              Component), which requires the implementation of mitigating measures for
              the environmental and social impacts of the Project.146 According to the
              PAD, the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), developed upon
              recommendation of the EA, includes a number of environmental activities
              that "will assure achievement of the project's environmental objectives."147
              Among this is the "implementation of an environmental baseline program to
              monitor oceanographic, biological and ecological indicators." The PAD
              adds that "[a]fter construction, this program will be converted to a long-
              term monitoring program."148 The EMP provides for a comprehensive
              monitoring of the quality of the sea water and sea bed which is also
              intended to help "in formulating a decision regarding the need for
              upgrading the treatment facilities."149

       146. The environmental license, article 9, requires the development of a
              monitoring program to be carried out before and after the Cartagena's
              proposed wastewater disposal system begins working. Monitoring is
              required in the treatment plant, and in the sea waters at the discharge point
              and in other mayor sensitive areas. CARDIQUE requires ACUACAR to
              present quarterly reports of the results and the evaluation of the monitoring
              conducted before the treatment plant and the marine outfall begin working.
              Samples must be taken particularly in the area of Punta Canoa. When the
              marine outfall starts functioning, ACUACAR must monitor the water
              quality daily for the first month and monthly later on.

       147. The Panel reviewed monitoring reports of several hundred pages prepared
              by ACUACAR to establish initial baseline data for water quality in the
              Ciénaga and along the coast up to Punta Canoa. The Panel finds that the
              Bank in requiring an adequate monitoring plan with adequate baseline
              data has complied with the provisions of OD 4.01. The Panel also notes

               that ACUACAR, as of summer 2003, had prepared comprehensive
               baseline data regarding fisheries in the area. The Panel again finds this
               to be in compliance with OD 4.01. In both cases the baseline data should
               provide a reasonable basis for evaluating the effects of the submarine
               outfall. The Panel notes, however, that it is essential that these studies
               be periodically updated to maintain their relevance and to identify
               changes in water quality or in fisheries.

1.4.6. Project impacts on locally affected communities

       148. The Panel notes that the existence of an outfall near the beach in Punta
               Canoa is likely to introduce a degree of awareness in the public that may
               decrease the recreational use of the beaches and adversely affect the
               generation of income from tourism and fishing activities. The Panel notes
               that, although an impact of this kind may stem from people's perceptions
               rather than reality, it may cause actual harm to economic activities. The
               Panel also observes that the tourism activities as well as the people's quality
               of life in and around the Punta Canoa area may be adversely affected by the
               presence of the treatment plant and the conduits of the land conveyance
               system, particularly if odors emanate from these facilities.

       149. The Requesters state that the men and boys of the affected villages fish each
               morning and evening. They use canoes and nets in traditional fishing
               techniques to catch small fish, shrimp, and lobster for daily consumption
               and also for sale of any surplus. The Requesters claim that biological and
               chemical contamination would deplete the fish stocks and could have
               "severe human health impacts for fishermen and anyone else exposed to the
               tainted fish or water."150 According to the Request, the EA claims that there
               is little marine life off the coast of Punta Canoa, and that the "untreated
               discharge will add to the biological life along the coast of Punta Canoa."
               The Requesters fear that the "primary life form that will be added to these
               waters is harmful bacteria and that any fish able to inhabit such an
               environment will be toxic."151

       150. As already noted, Management states that the impacts of the outfall on
               fishing would be negligible and in any event, fish are not abundant in the
               area where the proposed outfall would be located.

       151. The Panel notes that in order to determine whether the Project will affect
               the fisheries, it is necessary to study the oceanographic conditions and the
               assimilative capacity of the disposal site. In normal years during spring time
               nutrients to the water surface provide ample bio-stimulation to support the
               food chain for local fish and crustaceans. However, there are periods,
               especially during calmer, summer oceanic conditions, when various types of

                algae bloom cause oxygen depletion and toxicity problems, which in turn
                cause fish kills near the shoreline. In addition, sewage contain significant
                amount of mercury and other metals which bio-accumulate within the food
                chain leading to health advisories for restricted consumption of fin fish.

        152. The Panel observes that while the outfall was designed so to minimize the
                impacts of waste water discharged in the sea, it is likely that the fishing
                conditions would change as a result. The Panel finds that in Project
                preparation the Project's potential effects on fishing in the area were
                not adequately addressed. The Panel examined the Project records but
                did not find adequate social evaluation and mitigation proposals of
                these potential impacts on the local population's lives and livelihood.
                The Panel finds that this does not comply with OD 4.01.152

2. Natural Habitats and Water Resources Management

2.1. Natural Habitats, OP 4.04


        153. The Requester state that the Bank did not comply with the precautionary
                principle set forth in the policy on Natural Habitats - OP 4.04 ­ "as a guide
                for projects that affect natural resources like the fisheries at stake here."153
                They also argue that the Bank has supported a Project that is not
                environmentally sustainable and that will "degrade a critical marine
                habitat."154

        154. Management Response states that "[w]ater at the Punta Canoa site is highly
                turbid due to current from the Rio Magdalena."155 As a result, "[a]t the
                location of the effluent discharge point, the water is obscure; light does not
                penetrate even during daytime and visibility is limited to approximately 50
                cm. Fish and other marine organisms are not abundant in this area."156 The
                Response adds that "[u]nderwater surveys at the outfall site show that the
                area has poor benthic activity and almost non-existent biological resources.
                This situation, together with the low context of toxic materials and heavy
                metals in the effluent discharge, precludes the risk of biological
                assimilation at the outfall site."157 In Management's view, the impacts of
                the outfall "would be negligible" and the work "conforms to the
                precautionary approach referred to in OP 4.04 and is in compliance with
                that policy."158 The analysis of alternatives had also considered shorter

               outfalls but then rejected them because they would be in proximity of coral
               reef ecosystems.159

       155. Management also states that during Project preparation the environmental
               studies, as well as the POE and the GOC, "fully" assessed the impacts of the
               Project on the local environment and on the fishing activities, and
               concluded that "the risk of environmental damage from the outfall would be
               minimal."160 The Response adds that "there is no evidence that the outfall
               will interrupt the economic activity of fishermen from Punta Canoa, Arroyo
               de Piedra and Manzanillo" because, it claims, the "area in the vicinity of
               the outfall has little marine life." According to Management, "fishing
               activity, to the extent it might occur in these areas, would not be adversely
               affected." However, Management states that the monitoring program
               provided under the Project, and the "availability of technical mitigatory
               measures if needed (chlorination and/or future waste stream treatment
               beyond preliminary treatment), will continue to ensure that fishing and
               tourism in the North Zone will not be affected by the proposed outfall."161

       156. Natural Habitats are defined in OP 4.04 as: "[l]and and water areas where
               (i) the ecosystems' biological communities are formed largely by native
               plant and animal species, and (ii) human activity has not essentially
               modified the area's primary ecological functions."162 And include:
               "[m]angrove swamps, coastal marshes, and other wetlands; estuaries;
               seagrass beds; coral reefs; freshwater lakes and rivers (...)."

       157. In the Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management
               Project the relevant natural habitats are the mangrove swamps of the
               Ciénaga and the Bahia and the coal reefs in the Caribbean Sea south-west of
               Tierra Bomba Island.

       158. The relevant objectives and requirements of OP 4.04 are: "Support for the
               protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their
               functions.... a precautionary approach to natural resource management to
               ensure opportunities for environmentally sustainable development."163
               "Identification of (a) natural habitat issues and special needs for natural
               habitat conservation, including the degree of threat to identified natural
               habitats (particularly critical natural habitats); and (b) measures for
               protecting such areas in the context of the country's development
               strategy."164 "The Bank promotes and supports natural habitat conservation
               and improved land use by financing projects designed to integrate into

               national and regional development the conservation of natural habitats and
               the maintenance of ecological functions. Furthermore, the Bank promotes
               the rehabilitation of degraded natural habitats."165 "In deciding whether to
               support a project with potential adverse impacts on a natural habitat, the
               Bank takes into account the borrower's ability to implement the appropriate
               conservation and mitigation measures. If there are potential institutional
               capacity problems, the project includes components that develop the
               capacity of national and local institutions for effective environmental
               planning and management. The mitigation measures specified for the
               project may be used to enhance the practical field capacity of national and
               local institutions."166 "In projects with natural habitat components, project
               preparation, appraisal, and supervision arrangements include appropriate
               environmental expertise to ensure adequate design and implementation of
               mitigation measures."167

        159. The Project's primary objectives are to improve the water and sewerage
               services of Cartagena and the sanitary conditions of the city's poorest
               population; to "facilitate the environmental cleanup of water bodies
               surrounding the city (Cartagena Bay, Caribbean beaches and Ciénaga de
               la Virgen lake) by providing adequate collection, treatment and disposal of
               the entire flow of the city's wastewater;" and to improve the sustainability of
               water and sewerage services in the city.

        160. While the first and the third Project's objectives relate to environmental
               matters, the second objective relates specifically to natural habitat. The
               Panel notes that these objectives are being addressed by the project.
               Interviews with Bank staff168 indicated that portions of the Ciénaga de la
               Virgen have already been declared a nature reserve by CARDIQUE, and
               that improvement of the Ciénaga water quality is a top priority for the city
               as the aquatic events of the Central American and Caribbean Games
               scheduled for 2006 will use the Ciénaga.

        161. Project component "G" specifically addresses the objectives and
               requirements of OP 4.04. These are: "(i) environmental supervision during
               construction; (ii) restoration and conservation of the Ciénaga de la Virgen
               nature reserve; (iii) carrying out a monitoring program before and after
               construction of the marine outfall to study the fate of pathogenic coliforms
               and their contaminants discharged through the outfall; and (iv) an
               environmental institutional strengthening program."

        162. The Panel finds that the mangrove swamps of the Ciénaga and Bahia
               de Cartagena and the coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea have been fully

                considered in the Feasibility Studies and the Environmental
                Assessments. Although item (ii) of Project component G on restoration
                and conservation of the Ciénaga de la Virgen Natural Reserve has yet
                to be implemented (because the project has not yet advanced to a stage
                where this is applicable,) the Panel finds that the Bank is otherwise in
                compliance with OP 4.04.


2.2. Water Resources Management

        163. The relevant environmental objectives of OP 4.07 are: "Support for
                providing potable water, sanitation facilities, flood control, and water for
                productive activities in a manner that is economically viable,
                environmentally sustainable, and socially equitable;"169 and "Restoring and
                preserving aquatic eco-systems and guarding against overexploitation of
                groundwater resources, giving priority to the provision of adequate water
                and sanitation services for the poor."170

        164. From an environmental perspective, the Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage
                and Environmental Management Project complies fully with the applicable
                objectives. The project will not exploit ground water resources and flood
                control is not a requirement. A major driver for the project is the need to
                preserve the Ciénaga de la Virgen and the Bahia de Cartagena aquatic
                systems while at the same time providing adequate water and sanitation for
                the poor of Cartagena in an economically viable manner.          This is in
                compliance with OP 4.07.

        165. The Panel finds that the decision made to disregard the Ciénaga de la
                Virgen as a potential place for final disposal of the waste after
                treatment allows for the preservation of this important ecosystem. The
                Panel also finds that the Feasibility Study,171 the Environmental
                Assessment172 and supplementary studies document well and analyze
                the condition of the biophysical environment, particularly of the
                Caribbean Sea, Bahia de Cartagena and the Ciénaga de la Virgen.
                However, they do not consider the terrestrial environment in as great a
                depth.

        166. The Panel finds that the Bank is in compliance with OP 4.07 on Water
                Resources Management and with OD 4.01 which requires that "water
                resources management should be environmentally sustainable."

3. Legal Requirements

         167. The Project's EA and the Feasibility Studies respectively include a section
                dealing with the legal framework within which the Project was to be
                designed and implemented.173 As well, the text of the Environmental
                License indicates the legal requirements based on which the license was to
                be granted.

         168. According to the Project's EA prepared in 1999, Colombian legislation in
                force at the time of Project preparation, although not dealing specifically
                with waste discharges through submarine outfalls,174 included the Decree
                1594 of 1984, which establishes water quality standards, and regulates
                relevant provisions of the Colombian Code of Natural Resources ­ Law
                2811 of 1974 ­ with respect to water uses and wastewaters discharge in
                water bodies.175 The Decree establishes, inter alia, quality standards for
                waters intended for recreational use, which are those that allow primary
                contact ­ e.g. swimming ­ or secondary contact ­ e.g. water sports.176 It
                also regulates the disposal of wastewaters in water bodies and sets forth
                standards for the wastewaters based on the designated use of the recipient
                waters and the nature of the disposing entity, whether new or existing
                user.177

         169. Article 42 of the Decree 1594/84 states that waters intended for primary
                contact must not contain oil, grease, other floating compounds, and toxic
                and irritating substances that negatively affect human health.178 Further, it
                sets specific limits for, inter alia, total and fecal coliforms in waters
                respectively intended for primary and secondary contact.179 According to
                the Project's EA, since specific laws regulating submarine outfalls were not
                in force when the Project was designed, this norm was taken as the quality
                criterion for designing the proposed outfall.180

         170. On November 17, 2000, Colombia adopted the technical regulations for

                   outfalls.181 Articles 177 through 180 of the technical regulations defined
                   submarine outfalls;182 described what studies must be carried out previous
                   to designing a submarine outfall to determine, among others, which primary
                   treatment will be necessary;183 set forth general guidelines to design an
                   outfall;184 and established that wastewaters discharged through a submarine
                   outfall must undergo primary treatment to guarantee removal of at least
                   60% of BOD, before being discharged into water bodies.185 According to a
                   legal opinion regarding the submarine outfall prepared for the Bank on May
                   3, 2004, by a Colombian law firm, Articles 178 and 180 of the RAS 2000
                   were modified in May 2001.186 The legal opinion states that, as amended,
                   the technical regulations no longer require primary treatment of the
                   wastewaters before disposing of them in water bodies. Art. 178, as
                   amended, would provide that among the studies to be conducted before
                   designing an outfall is the evaluation of the wastewaters to determine what
                   type of treatment is necessary; and Art 180, as amended, would now require
                   the design, construction and operation of a system of prior treatment of
                   wastewaters before the disposal, so as to meet the water quality standards
                   set forth in the Colombian environmental and sanitary legislation in
                   force.187 According to the opinion, there is an obligation to maintain certain
                   quality standards for the body of water that receives the wastewater but not
                   for quality of the wastewater itself.188

186Legal opinion, Concepto Emisario Submarino Cartagena, dated May 3, 2004, prepared for the Bank by
Mr. Luis Fernando Macia Gomez, provided to the Inspection Panel [hereinafter "legal opinion"].
According to this opinion, the Resolución 1096 de 17 Noviembre 2000 (RAS 2000) was amended by
Resolución 0424 of May 18, 2001, and its Art. 180 as amended now reads, "Tratamiento previo al
vertimiento con emisarios submarinos. Se debe diseñar, construir y operar un sistema de tratamiento
previo de aguas residuales [...]" The Panel was informed about this amendment during its June 2004
eligibility visit to the Project area. The Panel met with a government official who told the Panel team that
certain provisions of the RAS 2000 were amended to require preliminary treatment in lieu of primary
treatment mainly because of economic considerations. According to this official, primary treatment for the
Cartagena Project would have entailed prohibitive Project costs. Allegedly, the authorities looked into the
possibility of requiring a lesser treatment. After researching and evaluating submarine outfalls in other
areas and discussing with an expert in the field, Henry Salas, they allegedly decided that preliminary
treatment was sufficient to meet the water quality standards provided by Colombian environmental and
health legislation.

         171. Pursuant to Colombian law, projects for treatment and disposal of
                wastewater are subject to obtaining an environmental license from the
                regional environmental authority as a condition for their implementation
                and operation.189 In 1998 ACUACUAR filed with CARDIQUE the request
                to obtain the environmental license for the proposed submarine outfall. On
                June 5, 2001, CARDIQUE issued License No. 345 granting the permit for
                the construction and operation of the outfall off the coast of Punta Canoa for
                disposal of Cartagena's wastewaters into the Caribbean Sea.190

         172. During its visit to the Project area the Panel team met with officials from
                CARDIQUE. They explained to the Panel that Colombian law requires the
                suspension of the license-issuance procedures under certain circumstances,
                namely public hearings and prior consultations about the project for which
                the license has been requested, and claims filed against the granting of the
                license.191 CARDIQUE officials informed the Panel that, as required by
                Colombian law, ACUACUAR conducted (a) public hearings about the
                outfall project with the Cartagena community, and (b) prior consultations of
                black communities that will be affected by the Project.192 This, they added,
                suspended the procedure to issue the license, which was then released in
                2001, three years after ACUACAR submitted the application. In addition,
                SIAB, the association of engineers and architects of the Bolivar
                department,193 filed an action with CARDIQUE against the resolution
                granting     the     license    and     subsequently        with     the    ministry      of
                Environment. CARDIQUE and the Ministry of Environment ratified the
                license, which became effective in 2002.         194


         173. CARDIQUE's Resolution No. 345 granted the environmental license but
                imposed a number of obligations. According to the first of these obligations,
                ACUACAR must submit to CARDIQUE by 2010 alternative proposals and
                the design of a treatment system that meets the removal standards set forth
                in the Decree 1594/84 for existing users195 and must build and operate the
                approved alternative treatment system by the second phase of the Project,
                (2015-2025). The license adds that the approved alternative will be an
                integral part of the treatment system proposed for the Project's second
                phase.196 CARDIQUE officials informed the Panel that the standards set in
                Decree 1594 /84 will require the District of Cartagena to upgrade the

                treatment plant from preliminary to primary treatment.197 A further
                condition to which the license was subjected provides for the
                implementation of the monitoring program that, under the Project, should
                commence before the construction of the outfall and continue afterwards to
                study the behavior of pathogenic coliforms and other contaminants
                discharged through the outfall.198

         174. The license required also, inter alia, that ACUACAR carry out a census of
                the fishermen in Punta Canoa, design and implement a fishing program
                before operating the outfall for the community of Punta Canoa, and prepare
                a project to supply water and sewage services for the communities of Punta
                Canoa, Manzanillo del Mar and Arroyo de Piedra.199

3.2. International Agreements

         175. The Requesters claim that the outfall Project violates the Cartagena
                Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment
                of the Wider Caribbean Region,200 in particular Article 7, which covers
                "Pollution from Land-Based Sources." They believe that the Project does
                not comply with the Convention's obligation to "take all appropriate
                measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the Convention area
                caused by coastal disposal or by discharges emanating from rivers,
                estuaries, coastal establishments, outfall structures, or any other sources on
                their territories."201 According to the Requesters, Colombia is also bound
                by the Protocol to the Cartagena Convention Concerning Pollution from
                Land-Based Sources and Activities signed in Aruba in 1999, because, under
                the Protocol, "wastewater dumped into Class 1 Caribbean waters
                (including water used for recreation and mangrove swamps) must meet
                stringent standards for total suspended solids, biological oxygen demand,
                pH, greases and oils, fecal coliforms, enterococci (fecal bacteria), and
                floating substances."202

         176. Management responds that "[a]s noted in the ruling by the Ministry of
                Environment (...) while Colombia is party to the Cartagena Convention it is
                not a party to the Land-Based Sources Protocol of the Cartagena


197According to the license the Project has three phases: the Interim Phase (until 2005) when wastewaters
will continue being discharged into the Ciénaga, while the Project works are carried out; the First phase
(2005-2015) which provides for, inter alia, the construction of the outfall, the conveyance system, and the
treatment plant; and the Second Phase (2015-2025) during which works to upgrade the treatment plant from
preliminary to primary treatment are to be carried out to deal with, inter alia, the population increase, and
thus the increase in the wastewater volume. CARDIQUE Resolution 345, p. 12. See also Management

                Convention (LBS)."203 Management adds that, based on the wording of the
                Convention's Article 7, which "urged countries in general terms to
                `prevent, reduce, and control pollution' from land based sources," "it
                appears that the Convention recognized that such practices would
                continue."204      In any event, the Response continues, any more specific
                obligations related to marine outfalls are included in the LBS Protocol,
                which is not applicable to the Project. Management also maintains that,
                were the LBS Protocol to apply, the Colombia government has already
                classified the waters as Class II; and the parties to the Protocol would have
                "up to ten years to implement provisions that enable the standards of the
                Protocol to be met."205

         177. The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine
                Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region was adopted in Cartagena on
                March 24, 1983.206 As of June 1, 2005, 21 States are party to the
                Convention. Colombia signed the Convention in 1983 and ratified it on
                March 3, 1988,207 so the provisions are binding upon Colombia. Three
                Protocols to the Cartagena Convention address specific environmental
                issues in the wider Caribbean region. The Protocol Concerning Pollution
                from Land-Based Sources and Activities (LBS Protocol), the relevant
                Protocol for this Project, was adopted in Aruba on October 6, 1999.208
                However, the Protocol is not yet in effect since as of June 1, 2005, only two
                countries have ratified it.209 While Colombia signed the Protocol on October
                on October 2, 2000, it has not ratified it. Hence the Protocol is not yet
                binding upon Colombia, even if it were in effect. It should be noted that the

providing a reference website address (http://www.cep.unep.org/law/cartstatus.html#lbs), indeed two
countries, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago, parties to Convention, ratified the Protocol respectively on
July 9, 2003 and March 28, 2003. See http://www.cep.unep.org/law/cartstatus.php#lbs. The Panel also

               Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 18, obligates a State to
               "refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty"
               if "it has signed the treaty (...)", or "it has expressed its consent to be bound
               by the treaty, pending the entry into force of the treaty and provided that
               such entry into force is not unduly delayed."210 The Panel notes that the
               license granted by CARDIQUE states that the Project shall adjust its
               treatment system to all requirements for the protection of water bodies
               and submarine ecosystems resulting from national legislation or
               international agreements to which Colombia will become a party.211

        178. The Cartagena Convention applies to the wider Caribbean Region; the
               "Convention area" comprises the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and
               the Atlantic Ocean adjacent south of 30 degree north latitude and within
               200 nautical miles of the Atlantic coasts of states parties to the
               Convention.212 The Convention requires the parties, inter alia, "to prevent,
               reduce and control pollution of the Convention area and to ensure sound
               environmental management (...)."213 Of particular relevance to the outfall
               Project, the Convention states that the "Contracting Parties shall take all
               appropriate measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the
               Convention area caused by coastal disposal or by discharges emanating
               from rivers, estuaries, coastal establishments, outfall structures, or any
               other sources on their territories."214 Further, Article 12 provides that
               technical and other guidelines should be developed for development
               projects "in such a way as to prevent or minimize harmful impacts on the
               Convention area," and requires the assessment of "the potential effects of
               such projects on the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas, so
               that appropriate measures may be taken to prevent any substantial
               pollution of, or significant and harmful changes to, the Convention area."215

        179. The LBS Protocol, adopted to implement in particular Article 7 of the
               Cartagena Convention, sets forth general obligations upon the parties and
               the legal framework for regional co-operation. The Protocol includes four
               annexes, but it envisions the development and adoption of future annexes to
               address other sources of pollution. Relevant to the outfall Project, Annex III
               addresses discharges of domestic wastewaters and determines specific
               regional effluent limitations for domestic sewage. The Protocol identifies
               two classes of receiving waters: "Class I" and "Class II" waters.216 Class I

             waters are those that are "particularly sensitive to the impacts of domestic
             wastewater."217 Class II waters are waters "less sensitive to the impacts of
             domestic wastewaters" than Class I.218 Effluent limitations are established
             by the protocol for Class I and for Class II waters, with the more stringent
             limitations applying to Class I waters.219 The Protocol also sets the
             distinction between new and existing domestic wastewater systems and
             states that new domestic wastewater systems are to comply with these
             effluent limitations immediately after the Protocol enters into force,
             whereas existing ones must comply with the effluent limitations within 10,
             15 or 20 years of the entry into force depending on the size of communities
             and the status of their current wastewater infrastructure.220

       180. When the Protocol comes into effect and if Colombia becomes a party to
             the Protocol, these provisions will be relevant to compliance with the
             license granted from CARDIQUE, since, as noted before, the license
             requires that the Project adjust its treatment system as a result of
             international agreements to which Colombia becomes a party.

CHAPTER THREE: SOCIAL COMPLIANCE




                  58

       1. Communities living in the North Zone of Cartagena: are they Indigenous
       Peoples under OD 4.20?

       181. The Requesters state that the Bank failed to "identify the affected
               communities as indigenous,"221 while in their view the people living in
               Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra, and Manzanillo clearly meet the
               requirements of the Bank policy OD 4.20 to be classified as Indigenous
               Peoples. According to the Request, the communities living in these villages
               "constitute a group `with a social and cultural identity distinct from the
               dominant society that makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the
               developmental process'."222 The Requesters believe that the people living
               in the villages of Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo meet many
               of the criteria the Bank policy requires to recognize certain groups as
               indigenous, such as "close attachment to ancestral territories and natural
               resources in the area; self-identification and identification by others as
               members of a distinct cultural group; distinct customary social and political
               institutions; and engagement in primarily subsistence oriented-production."


       182. The Requesters state that Punta Canoa is a centuries-old village that has
               remained a "traditional fishing village" and where the majority of the
               families "go back at least three generations."223 They add that the three
               villages have a "way of life distinct from the rest of Colombian society."224
               According to the Request, the Bank's Project Appraisal Report also noted
               that "the residents "live under the traditions and culture of their ancestors
               and keep the structure of rural families;" that the "villagers make a living
               through subsistence farming and fishing, for which they use their own hand-
               crafted boats and tools;" and that "Punta Canoa also has a number of
               unique religious and social customs derived from their ancestors, including
               festivals, games, dances, and marriage rituals." However, the Requesters
               claim, the Bank did not appreciate these cultural characteristics and "the
               extent to which they are vulnerable to destruction by the outfall."225


       183. Management states that the Project's Social Assessment recognizes that the
               communities of La Boquilla, Manzanillo, Arroyo de Piedra and Punta
               Canoa are "long-established communities with strong family ties and
               traditions." However, according to the Bank "they do not meet the criteria
               for OD 4.20 with regard to ancestral territory, self-identification,
               indigenous language or presence of customary social and political
               institutions." Management states that the Bank "correctly determined that
               OD 4.20 does not apply."

      184. Management argues that the communities living in the North Zone of
            Cartagena are also not recognized as indigenous people under Colombian
            Law. Management Response refers to two rulings from the Government of
            Colombia requested by ACUACAR in this regard. The first is contained in
            a letter dated August 11, 1998, where the "Minister of the Interior
            determined that the communities in question were not considered
            `indigenous' under Colombian law"226 In addition, in a further letter dated
            July 30, 1999, "the Ministry of Interior certified that the communities were,
            however, considered Afro-Colombian under the provisions of Law 70
            (1993)."227 Management adds that ACUACAR requested these rulings
            because the North Zone communities were not included in the official
            register of Afro-Colombian communities. The Jorge Artel foundation, a
            local NGOs, subsequently appointed by the "Negritude Commission" of the
            Ministry of Interior, certified that these communities are considered Afro-
            Colombians under Colombian Law 70.

      185. The Panel takes note that under Colombian legislation the communities
            living in the North zone of Cartagena are not recognized as indigenous
            peoples. The Panel emphasizes that the issue under investigation is whether
            the Bank followed OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples during the design,
            appraisal and execution stages of the Project with regards to the Afro-
            Colombian communities living in the area of the proposed outfall. The
            classification of certain groups as indigenous peoples under Bank policy
            OD 4.20 is not necessarily consistent with, or subject to, local legislation,
            but is still binding on the Bank.

      186. OD 4.20 defines "indigenous peoples" as "social groups with a social and
            cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that makes them
            vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process." The policy
            recognizes that no single definition is available to embrace all indigenous
            peoples and their "diversity". Thus, it provides for a number of criteria,
            whose "presence in varying degrees" is useful to identify indigenous
            peoples in particular geographical areas:

      "(a) close attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural resources in these
      areas;

      (b) self-identification and identification by others as members of a distinct
      cultural group;

      (c) an indigenous language, often different from the national language;

      (d) presence of customary social and political institutions; and

         (e) primarily subsistence-oriented production."

                Some Indigenous Peoples can be wage earners, or canbe small-scale market
                oriented people. The policy adds that "Task managers (TMs) must exercise
                judgment in determining the populations to which this directive applies and
                should make use of specialized anthropological and sociological experts
                throughout the project cycle." (Emphasis added)

         187. Management states that the World Bank's Quality Assurance Team
                approved the decision reflected in the Project's Social Assessment that no
                indigenous people would be affected by the Project.228 However, the Panel
                finds that no "specialized anthropological and sociological experts" were
                consulted in this decision, contrary to the intention of OD 4.20. The
                Panel could find no discussion during project preparation as to whether the
                presence of Afro-Colombian communities should trigger application of the
                Indigenous Peoples Policy.

         188. The Panel notes that the criteria OD 4.20 requires to identify a particular
                group as indigenous people are shared by most vulnerable ethnic minorities.
                However, the Panel also notes that the policy does not say that all the
                criteria have to be met in order for the policy to be triggered. Moreover,
                neither are these criteria ranked in any hierarchy of importance.

         189. Colombia and the Americas in general contain many peoples who were
                ethnic minorities in Africa, deracinated from West Africa by slavery, and
                forced to the Americas. Their languages and cultures were penalized to such
                an extreme degree that most of their language and culture was lost during
                400 years of slavery. There is no dispute that slaves had clearly different
                languages, culture, and ethnicity -- all distinct from the dominant society.
                In those groups of escaped or freed slaves who fled from the dominant
                society to safety in remote and inaccessible sites, some of their original
                language and culture persists or has been restored.229

         190. The Afro-Colombians potentially affected by the project are located in
                several villages on the coast north of Cartagena.                    Estimates of the
                populations differ greatly and the latest is from 1996.                  The 1999 EA
                recommends a survey of the potentially affected population, but this was
                not carried out at the time of Project preparation. The communities may be

228 An internal World Bank memo dated April 14, 1999 stated: "...nor is there any indication that
indigenous peoples will be affected by the proposed works."
229 One of the best examples of a distinct ethnic minority totaling losing all its land, and almost totally
losing its language and culture and subsequently remembering it and restoring their cultural identity is one
group of the Kung Nam San people of the Kalahari, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Most lost their
language and culture. Anthropologist Hugh Brody found individuals who remembered some words.
Restoration of land rights and resumption of living together they found their language was being re-learned
and aspects of their culture were remembered.

            more than two centuries old. Arroyo de Piedra dates from 1550 (fide Fund.
            Jorge Artel). Over 90% own their own homes. They are tightly knit and
            cousin marriages are common. The best guess for current populations of
            the three communities are Arroyo de Piedra (3200), Punta Canoa (900), and
            Manzanillo del Mar (1400). Other villages nearby are marked on some
            maps but do not seem to have been acknowledged during the Environmental
            Assessment. There are few if any non-Afro-Colombians living in the
            communities.     They rarely leave the community to live elsewhere, as
            provided for the GOC's specifics on Raizales. More than half have had no
            schooling. Practically all are in the poorest stratum of the poverty
            classification. They fish cooperatively by necessity. Surplus seafood is
            sold to middlemen, in the city of Cartagena, especially to Mercado Bazurto.
            The three main communities have 8-10 outboard motors each. About 30 are
            employed in menial jobs in the three adjacent modern shrimp corporations
            in Punta Canoa and at the Hidrocultivos shrimp facility in Arroyo de
            Piedras. Weekend tourism to eat reputable seafood on an unpolluted beach
            is the second most important income earner for the three communities.
            Because the vicinity is known for its unpolluted beaches and ocean, several
            modern hotels have been built just south and just north of Punta Canoa.
            This is a source of wage employment for Afro-Colombians.

       191. The Panel notes that the Afro-Colombians are vulnerable to being
            disadvantaged by economic development as the policy specifies. They
            suffer disproportionately from social exclusion. They are closely attached to
            their natural resources of the ocean and some practice subsistence-oriented
            production. The Afro-Colombians living in the North Zone of Cartagena
            identify themselves as a distinct society different from the dominant society
            and they are treated in Cartagena as being a separate group. The main OD
            4.20 criterion they lack is an indigenous language. After all these years,
            their language has been largely lost during 400 years of slavery, although it
            has been reported to linger on elsewhere in the Palenque community. The
            Panel finds that in the case of the Afro-Colombians who submitted the
            Request, the affected community meets most of the OD's criteria,
            except for an "indigenous language" and arguably a predominant
            "primarily-oriented subsistence production." The Panel finds that Afro-
            Colombians could reasonably have been regarded as indigenous
            peoples under Bank policies. But because of the absence of two of the
            policy criteria, the failure to do so in this specific case may not be
            deemed as noncompliance with the "judgment" called for in OD 4.20,
            paragraph 5. If the Afro-Colombians were regarded as indigenous
            peoples, the provision of OD 4.20 would have applied.



2. Indigenous Peoples Development Plan




                                           62

       192. According to the Requesters, as the Afro-Colombian communities meet the
             criteria of OD 4.20 to be identified as indigenous peoples, "the Bank should
             not have approved the project or loan without an appropriate `indigenous
             peoples development plan' as required under OD 4.20."


       193. Management objects that the North Zone communities trigger the Bank
             policy on Indigenous Peoples as they cannot be recognized as such.
             Therefore, "there was no need for an Indigenous Peoples Development
             Plan."


       194. The Panel notes that the goal of preparing an IPDP is to foster compliance
             with the Bank's Indigenous Peoples policy. The IPDP specifies how to
             reduce impacts and calculate adequate compensation for vulnerable
             communities. Preparation and implementation of an IPDP is the process by
             which social and environmental impacts are identified so that they can be
             prevented. If it is demonstrated that certain impacts cannot be prevented,
             they must be minimized, compensated for, or otherwise mitigated.

       195. The Panel notes that had the affected Afro-Colombian communities been
             categorized from the outset as indigenous peoples under OD 4.20, an IPDP
             would have been prepared in order to prevent or mitigate the impacts and to
             ensure that net benefits would accrue to the affected indigenous peoples.
             The Panel finds that there is no complete list, schedule or financial
             arrangements of mitigatory measures or compensation for the project's
             risks for the people living in the area of the proposed outfall. The risks
             are significant and the mitigatory measures found in the documentation,
             while strengthened over time, are weak.

       196. Since the Afro-Colombians could reasonably have been regarded as
             indigenous peoples within the Indigenous Peoples policy, the Panel
             finds that the Bank would have been well advised to require an
             Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) or a similar document
             identifying impacts of the Project on these people and providing
             mitigation measures for risks and potential harm, particularly in light
             of the inadequacies of the Social Impact Assessment.

       197. The Panel notes that the subsequent studies carried out by ACUACAR to
             develop a baseline for Project monitoring contain a comprehensive set of
             socio-economic data about the Project affected communities. This can be
             used as a basis for developing a set of suitable compensatory measures.

3. Prevention and Mitigation of Impacts for the Affected Communities and Benefits

         198. The Requesters believe that the construction of the submarine outfall will
               threaten "to upset and even destroy the culture and way of life that has
               existed in these villages for generations."230 In their opinion, construction
               works will increase noise, traffic, and workers in the area and will "bring
               rapid and unwelcome change to these peaceful and close-knit Afro-
               Colombian villages that currently live without even basic modern
               amenities."231 The Requesters also argue that the Project will force these
               communities, which are among the Colombia's poorest but mostly self-
               sufficient, "to bear the cost of (...) long-term, disruptive construction;232
               foul-smelling, noisy, and ugly sewage conveyance infrastructure;
               pathogenic bacteria and chemical contaminants in their coastal waters and
               fisheries, their most important natural resource; and sewage matter on their
               beaches."       They also claim that these adverse impacts may drive these
               people to move somewhere else.


         199. According to the Request, the Bank failed to ensure that the Project's
               potential adverse impacts on the communities living in the North Zone be
               adequately prevented and mitigated, and that net benefit would result for
               these communities.233 The Requesters complain that the EA addressed the
               social and economic effects that the Project will have on the villages of
               Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra, and Manzanillo "only in the most cursory
               fashion." As a result, they believe that neither the PAD nor the EA
               adequately took into account "the magnitude of the project's impact on
               these communities nor their residents' level of concern and opposition."234
               In particular, the Requesters state that while they fear that the Project will
               adversely affect fishing, which they claim is their primary source of
               livelihood and income, the Project authorities dismissed their concerns.

         200. Management Response states that the Project has assessed adequately the
               social and economic effects on the villages of Punta Canoa, Arroyo de
               Piedra and Manzanillo. Management believes that both Bank and
               ACUACAR staff "have taken adequate steps to address the concerns of the
               village residents."235 Management claims that the Social Assessment
               prepared under the Project identified, inter alia, the social and economic
               conditions of the project affected population, including the villages of the

232The outfall pipeline and other infrastructure will be built through or near the village of Punta Canoa.
According to the Project Appraisal, "[t]he construction of a pipeline and outfall of such length and
diameter will entail potentially significant negative impacts on communities and surrounding natural
habitats. The proper management of excavation materials, river and drainage crossings, and the reduction
of nuisances such as dust, noise, increased traffic, pedestrian safety concerns, and the presence of a large
work force in or near small rural communities, will necessitate careful engineering planning, closed [sic]
supervision, and a continuous and intense community information program." PAD p. 95-96.

               North Zone, and consequently an impact mitigation program was
               prepared.236    The   Response     adds   that "the main outcomes and
               recommendations of the SA were built into project design to better target
               beneficiaries and enhance project quality."237

       201. Management states that one of the Project's components includes
               Environmental and Social measures. In addition, the Project finances the
               Social Impact Mitigation and Community Development Program which
               provides for activities that will be co-financed by the District Government.
               With particular respect to the communities in the North Zone, the Response
               points out that "provision of piped water services for Manzanillo, Punta
               Canoa and Arroyo de Piedra is a condition of the Loan Agreement for the
               project prior to construction of the outfall."238 It adds that the "works to
               provide these communities in the North Zone with water services are about
               to begin." Moreover, "`sanitation packages' comprising in-house facilities
               will be installed in the poorest households in La Boquilla" and "two
               community centers, one in La Boquilla and another in Punta Canoa, will be
               built (...)."239


       202. Finally, Management emphasizes that "the analysis conducted under the
               SA, the resulting North Zone water supply and the Social Impact Mitigation
               and Community Development Program, together with the activities to be
               supported by the District, address the project's social and economic
               impacts in general, and, in particular, impacts on the communities of Punta
               Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo."240


       203. As already noted, the Panel finds that the Afro-Colombians affected by the
               project could reasonably have been regarded as indigenous peoples under
               the Bank policy OD 4.20. However, since Management did not apply this
               policy, this report considers how the provisions of OD 4.01 on
               Environmental Assessment, which the Bank regarded as the applicable
               policy, were applied with respect to the Requesters' above mentioned
               complaint. OD 4.01 requires recognizing and taking into account "all
               environmental consequences of a project (...) early in the project cycle" so
               as to ensure that projects are environmentally sound and sustainable. "EAs
               identify ways of improving projects environmentally, by preventing,
               minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse impacts."241 The
               policy adds that the views of affected communities and NGOs should be
               taken "fully" into account, because this is "important in order to understand
               both the nature and extent of any social or environmental impact and the

               acceptability of proposed mitigatory measures, particularly to affected
               groups."242 Annex B of OD 4.01 requires the EA to identify inter alia "the
               socio-economic conditions, including any changes anticipated before the
               Project commences" and to identify and assess "the positive and negative
               impacts likely to result from the proposed project" as well as the
               "mitigation measures, and any residual negative impacts that cannot be
               mitigated."243


        204. The Panel notes that, as the Project has not been constructed yet, the
               impacts from the pipeline, sewage treatment plant and the ocean sewage
               diffuser have not yet emerged. However, the risks of the Project have
               already caused turmoil and consternation in all three ethnic communities.
               ACUACAR's social communications contractor described the Project to the
               Panel during its visit to the Project area as "a nuclear bomb ticking" in the
               three villages.244 The Panel was also informed about an incident where
               ACUACAR's topographic surveyors were physically denied entry to Punta
               Canoa by the Afro-Colombians communities because these felt they
               threatened by the Project.


        205. The social impacts of the Project were assessed in the Social Impact
               Assessment (SIA) prepared in 1998.245 The Panel notes that most of this
               social assessment focuses on the major social benefits to the target
               population in the city of Cartagena, namely the Southeast Urban Area. The
               Panel finds that the full SIA does not adequately address compensation
               for the affected Afro-Colombian communities in the North Zone for
               bearing most of the risk of negative impacts of the sewerage component
               for the Project. Some attention is focused on La Boquilla, which is a
               community furthest from the impact zone. The "SA summary" does not
               summarize the SA, but is a stand alone document, and in some ways is
               more useful than the full SIA.

        206. The Panel finds that the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is
               unsatisfactory with respect to its analysis of the Project's impacts upon
               the communities living in the North Zone of Cartagena who presented
               the Request for Inspection. Irrespective of whether Afro-Colombians
               are classified as indigenous peoples or not, they are affected by the
               Project because they will be exposed to a wide range of risks as a result
               of the construction and operation of the Project.

3.2. Risks perceived by the Afro-Colombian communities in relation to fishing and
other activities

         207. The Panel notes that one of the biggest contradictions in the Project
                 documentation concerns the role of the fishing activity in the area of the
                 proposed outfall in the Afro-Colombian economy.

         208. The EA states that there is very little sea life near Punta Canoa: "No se
                 observó ningún tipo de flora y fauna" off the coast of Punta Canoa.246
                 Management reiterates this statement in its July 2004 Response to the
                 Request for Inspection­ "The area in the vicinity of the outfall has little
                 marine life"247 ­ and in staff interviews with the Panel. Management seems
                 to dismiss the importance for these communities of the fishing activity
                 around the area of the proposed outfall and their concerns by simply stating
                 that "fishing activity, to the extent it might occur in this area, would not be
                 adversely affected."248

         209. On the other hand, the EA acknowledges that a decrease in fishing
                 resources was one of the main Project-related concerns expressed by the
                 people living in the North Zone.249 These fishing resources are described in
                 a 2003 study carried out by INVEMAR (Instituto de Investigaciones
                 Marinas y Costeros) that documents the bountiful fisheries caught in area of
                 influence of the Project­ the tonnage of the about 50 species of fish caught,
                 together with statistics on the lucrative catches of crabs, lobsters, prawns,
                 shrimp, oysters, and mollusks.250 According to the study, there are 132
                 fishermen in Punta Canoa, 49 in Manzanillo del Mar and 201 in Arroyo de
                 Piedra.251 The INVEMAR study also confirms that fishing is a mainstay in
                 the economy of the area of influence of the Project. Seafood pays for all
                 schooling, water, electricity and housing. According to this document,
                 earnings can exceed 1 million pesos/month/fishing group. An average
                 harvest would be about 200,000 pesos. Half of the fishing population earn
                 over 500,000 Pesos/month. All three Afro-Colombian communities own
                 outboard motors; about 8 in Punta Canoa, 10 in Manzanillo del Mar, and 9
                 in Arroyo de Piedra. Each community owns numbers of fiberglass and
                 wooden vessels, long lines of hooks, and expensive drift nets. All three
                 affected communities own at least one motorized vehicle to transport
                 surplus fish to Cartagena's fish market and elsewhere, where Punta Canoa

                 seafood commands a reputation as less polluted than seafood from La
                 Bocana, La Boquilla and the Ciénaga. Seafood is also related to the
                 communities' second and third biggest contributors to their livelihoods,
                 namely tourism and employment in the shrimp facilities.

         210. Seafood and fishing in the outfall area are indeed the core of the North Zone
                 communities' economy and livelihood. The PAD states that "Punta Canoa
                 is a small village of only 500 inhabitants mainly living from fishing."252
                 The Project 1999 EA also cites a CIOH 1998 Study according to which
                 fishing is identified as one of the traditional occupations of the villages of
                 Punta Canoa, Manzanillo del Mar and Arroyo de Piedra.253 In light of the
                 foregoing, the Panel would like to emphasize that, as the sewage outfall is
                 designed to be located in the main Afro-Colombian fishing grounds, any
                 risks to their seafood must be taken seriously. The Panel finds that the EA
                 and Management erred in concluding that fishing in the area of
                 influence of the outfall is negligible or unimportant in the affected
                 communities without more detailed studies about this issue.254

         211. Awareness of the presence of an outfall is likely to create impacts in the
                 areas where the outfall is located. All identified risks are perceived until
                 some of them happen. Environmental and social assessments are based on
                 best efforts, combined with experience, of perceived risks or impacts.
                 Prudence leads us to take a precautionary approach so that if perceived risks
                 actualize, the predicted impacts are prevented or are not as severe as they
                 would have been without the mitigatory measures. Clearly, some of these
                 sewage risks are perceived and may transpire.

         212. The Panel notes the following risks perceived by the Afro-Colombian
                 communities:

              a. Pollution of fish, crustaceans and mollusks near the submarine outfall,
                   which may decrease harvests. Red tides from Cartagena are spreading
                   outwards from the city towards La Boquilla, but are still not affecting the
                   three communities yet;

              b. Possible harm of pathogenic infection of sea food consumers;

              c. Damage to the reputation of Punta Canoa seafood in Cartagena market,
                   thus decreasing prices and sales;

252 PAD, p. 104.
253 Environmental Assessment, Fundación Neutrópicos, 1999 p. 73.
254 For example, the ACUACAR's baseline study (Linea Base del Plan the Tratamiento y Disposición de
Aguas Residuales de Cartagena de Indias ­ ACUACAR S.A. E.S.P. Recursos Pesquero y
Aprovechamiento) of July/August 2003, that is after Board approval of the Loan, contains detailed
information about fish population in the Punta Canoa, Ciénaga and Municipality of Cartagena areas (in
fishing point indicated by the communities) and does not show substantial differences in the fish population
in these areas. Similar results are shown in the above-mentioned INVEMAR study.


                                                     68

             d. Damage to the three modern shrimp-based facilities255 all of which were
                  sited at Punta Canoa because of the clean sea water.                    All depend on
                  intakes of clean sea water;

             e. Any harm to the shrimp industry, the biggest employer in the community,
                  will decrease employment of villagers. The shrimp industry is deeply
                  concerned about the proposed sewage outfall. The EA does not seem to
                  take the three modern shrimp facilities into consideration;

             f. The sewage treatment facility to be located adjacent to Punta Canoas may
                  harm tourism, the second biggest economic mainstay of the village;

             g. Shellfish (e.g., oysters, clams, and scallops), other filter feeders and
                  mollusks are important in the nutrition and market economy of the
                  villagers. The risk is that such animals will bioaccumulate phytotoxins
                  and heavy metals from the submarine outfall whatever the dilution rate
                  may be;

             h. There will be foul odors from the sewage treatment adjacent to Punta
                  Canoa plant and sludge disposal when the winds blow towards the village
                  (i.e.: when the sea breezes reverse);

             i.   Preliminary sewage treatment is expected to be upgraded to primary
                  treatment in ten years. This implies expansion of sewage treatment close
                  to the village. This is a cost to tourism and aesthetics as it is on the only
                  road leading into the village;

             j. The village is being used as a risky experiment without consent.                            If
                  monitoring detects problems, sewage will be chlorinated, which may
                  create carcinogenic compounds in the effluent as it is released to sea
                  water;

             k. If damage to the community continues (i.e. "if needed"), primary and
                  secondary sewage treatment may be added. This implies that the village




255 Although shrimp farming began near Punta Canoa in the 1980s, an advanced public/private research
institute (Ceniaqua: Centro de Investigaciones de Colombia) and two modern shrimp breed stock facilities
IdelCaribe and Aquatec) are located adjacent to Punta Canoa and create their biggest source of wage labor
for the community. These three shrimp facilities are socio-economically important, yet seem to have been
overlooked in the social and environmental assessments, as possibly with Hidrocultura in Arroyo de
Piedras. The three facilities might be seriously affected by the sewage project if water quality deteriorates
at the shrimp facilities water intakes. Problems and declining production at the three other shrimp facilities
around La Boquilla (Rancho Chico, Acacia del Mar, Inamar) may already have set in as the red tides and
pollution from Cartagena is reaching La Boquilla with increasing frequency.


                                                     69

                  will have to be damaged before investing in safer sewage treatment. This
                  violates the precautionary approach mandated in OP 4.04;256

             l.   Monitoring, no matter how diligent, does not protect people if an
                  emergency arises. Monitoring may raise the alarm in an emergency, but
                  has little to do with protecting people from harm;

             m. Punta Canoa has only muddy or dusty dirt lanes in the village. The
                  blacktop roads ends just before the village near the site of the sewage
                  treatment plant. This may create significant impacts on the whole village,
                  such as noise, accidents, dust, vibrations, and social risks, because of (a)
                  construction of the major preliminary treatment plant adjacent to the
                  community, (b) construction of the submarine conveyor on the other
                  (coastal) side of the village, and (c) construction and burial of the sewage
                  pipe connecting the two facilities. All of this suggests that there will be a
                  major increase in heavy traffic. No mention has been seen of blacktopping
                  Punta Canoa main street before construction, use of an access road by-
                  passing the village, speed limits or other means of traffic management to
                  reduce such impacts. As dwellings of poorer households are made of
                  wattle-and-daub, vibration from heavy trucks may damage such dwellings
                  unless prevented in advance;

             n. Dredging and excavation during construction of the submarine outfall may
                  raise turbidity, harm filter feeders in the vicinity, and reduce seafood.

3.3. Benefits for the Afro-Colombian communities in the North Zone

        213. The Requesters argue that "[w]hile project planners have set aside money
                for constructing water and sewerage facilities to service the villages in an
                attempt to compensate them for these burdens [...] such facilities will not
                provide adequate compensation for permanent negative impacts on the
                health, food sources, and way of life of these indigenous people."257

        214. Management claims that the North zone communities "will benefit from the
                project in many ways."258 The Response lists a number of benefits that will
                stem from the Project: piped waters services to Punta Canoa, Arroyo de
                Piedra and Manzanillo del Mar; sanitation services for these communities,
                "should additional funds exist;"259 in-house sanitation facilities; two
                communities centers in La Boquilla and Punta Canoa; an orchard for Punta
                Canoa for post-construction reforestation activities and to provide an

256There seems to be a logical fallacy in waiting for damage and then moving to primary and secondary
treatment as insisted on by LAC's QAT. If primary and secondary treatments are to be retrofitted, and if
harm to the Afro-Colombians accrues, a submarine outfall in that location may not be needed, nor would
the 21 km-long pipe, nor the major recurrent energy costs of pumping.

               additional revenue source; work opportunities during construction; and
               improvement of the environment in general, which will enhance tourism in
               the area creating economic opportunities. Management also claims that
               ACUACAR is studying how to optimize the fishing activity in Punta Canoa
               and that "project funds will be available to implement the study
               recommendations."260

       215. Management also states that a Social Impact Mitigation and Community
               Development Program has been developed and will be financed jointly with
               the Borrower.261 The program for the communities around the Ciénaga and
               the North Zone, inter alia, provides "these two areas with priority attention
               through the Citizens Participation and People Development Program,
               which offers training and assistance to develop small productive
               activities."262

       216. The Bank policy on Environmental Assessment states that an EA has to
               "identify ways of improving projects environmentally, by preventing,
               minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse impacts."263 It adds
               that an EA is a formal mechanism to address the concerns of affected
               people and local NGOs. The policy calls for meaningful consultations of
               affected communities, which improve the decision-making process and
               "increase community cooperation in implementing the recommendations of
               the EA."264 To do so the policy requires that affected group and NGOs be
               informed in a timely manner and in a form understandable to the people
               being consulted about the project and its objectives.265 When describing an
               EA Report in Annex B, OD 4.01 also requires the identification of both the
               positive and the negative impacts deriving from the Project.

       217. The Panel notes that the PAD mentions two benefits, potable water and
               sewerage services that will be provided to the Northern communities. The
               PAD also affirms that the Afro-Colombian Northern Communities were
               complaining before 1999 that they will not receive any benefit from the
               Project.266 Commendably, the PAD continues: "[t]o relieve their concerns,
               a condition that the District of Cartagena would ensure that, within four
               years from loan signing, piped water supply service will be provided to the
               north zone communities, has been incorporated in the loan agreement."267
               This important benefit for the affected communities looks well on the way
               to being fulfilled.

      218. During the Inspection Panel's October 2004 visit to the project area, steel
              water pipes have been stored all along the roads into Manzanillo del Mar
              and to Punta Canoa. However, in interviews with Bank staff the Panel
              found that communications between the Requesters and the Project officials
              on this and other aspects of the Project have broken down and
              misinformation is rife.    ACUACAR asserts that they have informed Punta
              Canoa and Manzanillo del Mar villagers that they will receive potable water
              in the near future and that house connections are planned by self-help to
              improve affordability. However, the Panel notes that the Afro-Colombians
              communities seem not to know whether their houses will be connected, or
              whether there will be three standpipes in each village, or there will be one
              central community water tank. Bank records reviewed by the Panel show
              that a decision on such matters had not been taken as of late 2004 nor were
              options concerning sanitation improvements and their financing.

      219. The Panel notes that because water bought from tanker trucks is very
              expensive, most villagers currently catch rain water from their roofs and
              store it in large drums. Depending on how many drums each householder
              can afford, such water lasts into the dry season, at which time householders
              purchase water from trucks. The Panel notes that the piped water is
              expected to be of saferand less expensive than the trucked water, which
              will be a significant benefit for the community. The Panel finds that this
              is compliance with OD 4.01.


      220. According to the PAD, the second benefit the affected communities will
              receive is the provision of sanitary services.268 The PAD, however, does not
              provide details of when sanitation will be provided, not what type, nor who
              will pay for what.

      221. The third benefit may be support for fishing. The Panel was informed that
              ACUACAR is planning a fishery support component for the villages.
              However, the Panel was unable to find additional information on this
              subject.


      222. Bank staff interviewed by the Panel also stated that the Afro-Colombian
              communities will also receive a kitchen and bathroom kit for some
              households, although staff was vague on specifics. The Panel notes that
              during its field visit the Panel team met nobody in these communities aware
              of the kitchen and bathroom kit.


      223. The Panel notes that the Afro-Colombian communities seem to have been
              considered less important than the major beneficiaries of Cartagena. They
              are relatively small in numbers, quiet, weak in political power, and lack

            voice in decisions that affect them severely. The Panel notes that these
            communities may be exposed to significant risks under the project.
            Some compensation for the potential impacts is provided under the
            Project, e.g. water and sanitation services, in accord with OD 4.01. The
            Panel welcomes the initiative to provide compensation for the Afro-
            Colombian minorities, but finds that details about some of the
            compensation measures are not specific, and it is unclear whether
            appropriate financial arrangements have been made to implement
            benefits, such as sanitation services and maintenance and operation of
            community centers. The Panel also finds that implementation of these
            measures seems to be lagging behind.

      224. The Panel also finds that information about these compensatory
            measures has been inadequately disseminated to the villages. The Panel
            observes that the North zone communities have been suffering from fears of
            low benefits and potentially big costs as a result of this Project. The Panel
            notes that there is real fear of major potential negative impacts of the
            project. The Panel also observes that the Requesters feel resentment that
            this compensation has not been agreed on and clarified. Many people seem
            not to be aware about the details of the benefits they are supposed to
            receive, including their timing. The possibility of some menial jobs for the
            short period during construction is not factored here. This is partly because
            although the wages will be real, the duration (c.18 months) is so ephemeral
            as to be a distraction, which could lead to heightened expectation, and
            divert attention away from more sustainable priorities of fishing and
            tourism.

      225. The Panel welcomes the proposed benefits for the people living in the
            Project area but notes that there seems to be no direct relation between such
            benefits and the risks that people may be exposed to as a consequence of
            Project construction and operation. There is no graduated approach to
            compensate the population for ­ or mitigate ­ the different risks as they
            materialize. For example, there are no social mitigation or compensatory
            measures in case of severe malfunction of the outfall that could lead to high
            presence of pathogens or other contaminants and/or a need to chlorinate the
            outfall discharge. This could affect the water quality near Punta Canoa and
            may affect people's health and their social and economic activities. In this
            sense, the proposed Social Impact Mitigation and Community
            Development Program seems to fall short in addressing the mitigation
            or compensation for harm related to potential adverse impacts of the
            Project as required by OD 4.01.

4. Consultation and participation of affected people

      226. This section of the report addresses the information and consultation
            process that took place during Project preparation and a communication



                                           73

               strategy which was developed and implemented after the Loan had been
               approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on July
               20, 1999.

       227. The Requesters believe that the Bank failed to take public concerns into
               consideration. According to the Request, the Bank claims that "public
               consultation meetings were held in Punta Canoa and the other villages, that
               `community concerns were registered'."269 The Requesters state that
               ACUACAR held two public hearings or meetings in Punta Canoa in 1998.
               However, they claim, "these meetings did not adequately register public
               concern.    Residents' accounts of at least two meetings indicate that
               executing agency ACUACAR was not honest with them about the potential
               effects of the outfall and even used deception to portray village support for
               the project as higher than it actually was."270

       228. Management claims that "extensive consultations were carried out under
               the project" and "a participatory approach was used during project
               preparation, starting in February 1998."271 Consultations were carried out,
               as required by OD 4.01, during the preparation of the Environmental
               Assessment. At a two-day seminary held in 1998 the TORs for the EA were
               discussed with all stakeholders including local NGOs, such as SIAB (the
               Association of Engineers and Architects of Bolivar). Management states
               that about 250 events took place between 1998 and 2003 and involved
               affected communities and other stakeholders.272

       229. Further, the Response states that consultations "were conducted as part of
               the SA process and the discussion of the preparation and results of the
               Social Impact Mitigation and Community Development Program"273 and
               focused on two areas, the neighborhoods south of Ciénaga de la Virgen and
               the community in the North Zone of Cartagena. Management adds that the
               Fundación Jorge Artel carried out this consultation process, which consisted
               in community meetings, general assembly meetings and selection of
               community representatives and "took place March 9-30, 1999."274
               Management further claims that the concerns expressed by the communities
               during consultations were taken into consideration in the project design. In
               particular, as people expressed concerns about the impact of the Project on
               fishing and their future employment opportunities, the Response claims, the
               "Environment and Social Component supports--among other activities--
               promoting the integration of community based groups, in particular to
               develop income-generating activities (...) [and] communications campaign

               to keep the population of Cartagena informed about progress on the
               project."

        230. "Meaningful consultations" of affected groups and NGOs are required
               under the policy on Environmental Assessment, OD 4.01. The policy states
               that the views of the affected people and local NGOs should be taken fully
               into account in particular while preparing the EA.275 This is important to
               allow the people to "understand both the nature and extent of any social or
               environmental impact and the acceptability of proposed mitigatory
               measures, particularly to affected groups."276 Consultations should occur
               after the Project has been assigned an EA category and once the draft EA
               has been prepared.277 Consultations on social issues may be linked to the
               EA consultations, and "should pay particular attention to those issues most
               likely to affect the people being consulted."278 The policy also requires that
               the affected people are given all relevant Project information prior to the
               consultations for these to be meaningful.279

        231. The Panel examined the Project records, and met with Bank staff, Project
               officials and the Requesters. During these meetings the Requesters
               emphasized to the Panel that consultations during the Project preparation
               were inadequate and that the people views, concerns and fears had not been
               taken into account. Bank staff, on the other hand, described at length their
               efforts to inform and consult the affected people, including those living in
               the North Zone ofCartagena.

        232. The PAD states that "public consultation meetings were held in the
               communities that would be most affected by the project: Arroyo de Piedra,
               Manzanillo del Mar, La Boquilla, Sur Oriental zone and Punta Canoas.
               Community concerns were registered and taken into account in the
               preparation of the Environmental Management Plan."280 The PAD adds
               that "perhaps the most important result of the consultation process was the
               decision by the Municipality to include a small yet important water supply
               component for the rural communities north of Cartagena."281 The EA
               includes similar statements282 and descriptions of workshops which took
               place in Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo del Mar during the
               EA preparation process.

        233. The Panel notes that two local NGOs ­ Fundación Vida and Fundación
               Jorge Artel ­ carried out the consultations in the context of preparing

            respectively the environmental and the social assessment. As already noted,
            Management states that the consultations conducted by Jorge Artel took
            place between March 9-30, 1999. However, a document obtained by the
            Panel during the investigation entitled "Proyecto the Agua y Saneamiento
            de Cartagena Informe de Negritudes" by the Fundación Jorge Artel
            ostensibly dated 1999 contains references to meetings and workshops with
            the communities in the North Zone dated March 9-30, 2000, that is after the
            Project preparation had been completed and the Loan for the Project
            approved by the Board of Executive Directors. In any event, this document
            does not make any references to any consultations carried out by the same
            Fundación Jorge Artel in the same area, for the same purposes exactly one
            year before. The Panel received no other evidence regarding the 1999
            consultation. The Panel finds that during Project preparation there
            were extensive consultations efforts with the people of Cartagena. This
            is in accord with OD 4.01. However, OD 4.01 requires that these
            consultations be timely, meaningful and relevant to Project design and
            execution. This is particularly important, in the case of the Afro-
            Colombians living in the area of the proposed outfall, who informed the
            Panel that they were not consulted about the location of the outfall but
            rather only informed about its construction and operation.

      234. Communication           Strategy   Management    states  that   ACUACAR
            implemented a communication strategy, at Bank's request, between 2001
            and 2002, that is after the Loan had been approved by the Bank's Board of
            Executive Directors. As part of this strategy, ACUACAR carried out a
            survey, according to which "79 percent of Cartagena's overall populations
            support the project and 36 percent of the North zone communities oppose
            it."283

      235. The Response further adds that workshop and various events took place, the
            most important of which was a "study tour for 23 community leaders,
            including representatives from the North Zone communities, to 6 similar
            outfall sites in Colombia, Chile and Uruguay; and participation of 23 key
            stakeholders, including community representatives, in an international
            course on the submarine outfall alternative for coastal cities in the
            Caribbean, organized by PAHO/WHO in Barbados." This study tour took
            place from September 3-9, 2001.284

      236. To implement the communication strategy, ACUACAR contracted Gran
            Publicidad Cia, a local company, to produce documentaries, videos and
            glossy brochures. The Panel notes that this expensive strategy may have
            worked well for the urban Cartagena beneficiaries, but has scarcely
            penetrated to the affected communities who submitted the Request to the
            Panel. The main brochure costs about US$15 each so few copies were

                 printed and allegedly not one was seen in the affected villages. The strategy
                 of producing many simple leaflets, posters and cartoons may have been
                 overlooked.

         237. Commendably, ACUACAR arranged for a cross-section of society to
                 inspect existing outfalls, similar to the proposed one for Punta Canoa.
                 Representatives from all three affected villages visited outfalls in
                 Valparaiso, Chile and in Montevideo. The Panel finds that this is best
                 practice. Unfortunately, this visit took place after the Project had been
                 designed and its location determined, while OD 4.01 requires this kind of
                 interaction during the preparation of the Project.

         238. The Panel met with officials from the Fundación Vida, who is also involved
                 in the implementation of the communication strategy. Fundación Vida has
                 one office/house in Punta Canoa staffed by two part-time apparently unpaid
                 facilitators, who are from the village and started work in February 2004.
                 They report monthly to Fundación Vida for ACUACAR. They are helped
                 by 20 multipliers who get basic training of a day or so per month and no
                 pay. They have a few explanatory posters and some documents (although
                 few villagers are literate). There are no leaflets to be handed out to visitors.
                 As most villagers have misgivings about the Project, the Vida office has
                 few visitors.

         239. Calming down a stressed community will be far more difficult than
                 maintaining good relationships with a neutral pre-project community. The
                 Vida Foundation communications program was started over one year ago
                 for Punta Canoa and Manzanillo del Mar.285 The Panel found that Arroyo
                 de Piedra is excluded from this program.              Starting a communications
                 strategy for the affected communities five years after appraisal is more
                 expensive and less effective than starting it during project preparation,
                 the time as it was done for the citizens of Cartagena.

         240. To be effective, communications and consultation need to begin as soon as
                 possible, and certainly no later than loan signing. This enables the strategy
                 to be proactive and preventive, rather than defensive, reactive and curative.
                 It is odd that Arroyo de Piedra has been excluded from the communications
                 strategy. This needs to be rectified as soon as possible.

         241. With hindsight, it would have been better to prevent Afro-Colombian
                 consternation and stress beforehand in two ways, by building effective and
                 permanent channels of communication in 1998 or earlier and by agreeing on
                 unambiguous net benefits in compensation for the significant impacts

               threatening the Afro-Colombian communities.                      The compensation for
               tolerating the impacts should have been negotiated at the same time
               Cartagena citizens were negotiating their net benefits, and in any event long
               before the Afro-Colombian minorities became hostile to the project. The
               communities voiced their concern long ago about water and dust. Provision
               of low-cost plastic tanks to catch roof rainwater for those households
               lacking capacity for storage would have been an instantaneous benefit.
               Sealing the two main streets in Punta Canoa from the end of the blacktop
               would prevent the main complaint of dust, could have boosted tourist
               revenues, and decreased fish handling costs.

        242. While the Project commendably included a communications strategy,
               the Panel observed that it failed to reach most members of the affected
               communities in the North Zone. An outreach strategy was added too
               late to deal effectively with the Project-related trauma and stress in
               these    communities.         The      Panel     finds      that    consultations        and
               communications with the affected Afro-Colombian communities in the
               area of the submarine outfall did not comply with OD 4.01.

4.1. Communities' consultations and willingness to pay for water services

        243. The Requesters' complaint that they have not been adequately consulted
               during the design and preparation phase of the Project extends also to the
               economic issues such as the willingness and capacity of the communities--
               particularly the poor areas of Punta Canoa and Manzanillo del Mar--to pay
               for future water and sewerage services.

        244. Annex 4 of the PAD discusses at length the issue of willingness to pay
               (WTP) for services and describes the surveys that were conducted in this
               regard.286 The Panel notes that the WTP studies did not include Punta
               Canoa and Manzanillo del Mar. At the time of appraisal, these very poor
               communities contained relatively few potential users of services. Although
               they were included in the Project, they appear not to have been included in
               the willingness-to-pay surveys. During the Panel's visit to these
               communities, community members in Punta Canoa indicated that they were
               not even sure whether the community would be connected to the sewer
               system, and if they were, who would finance the individual sewerage
               connections.287 Moreover, community members pointed out that they were
               still not sure about (a) whether water supply services would be delivered to
               the front or inside of each property, (b) who would pay for the water
               connection costs, and (c) whether standpipes would be placed on each street
               block.

        245. For Punta Canoa, the question of willingness and capacity to pay points
                toward the benefits that this project would bring to this poor community:
                water supply and sewerage services. As of October 2004, private water
                distributors (in trucks) sell drinking water in Punta Canoa at Col$100 per
                five liters. This represents US$7.776 per 1 cubic meter of water. If the
                Punta Canoa community, classified under "estrato No.1" (the poorest
                population within the system), were connected today to ACUACAR's
                system, they would be paying the equivalent of US$0.33 per cubic meter of
                water. Even if the cost of sewerage service is included, the price for a cubic
                meter of water would be only US$0.52. The tariff agreement among
                ACUACAR, the District, and the SSPD, provides a cross-subsidy between
                higher- and lower-income consumers. By December 2005, when this
                subsidy will be reduced, estrato No.1 will be paying about US$0.51 per
                cubic meter of water and US$0.80 if sewerage service is included. All these
                prices assume an average household consumption of about 20 cubic meters
                of water per month, which is realistic when people are connected to a safe
                water distribution system. The tariff system takes into account the fixed
                costs of supplying water and sewerage services: a household that consumes
                only one cubic meter of water per month--a very improbable scenario--
                would pay US$2.13 for the water, or US$ 3.26 if it is connected to the
                sewerage system.

        246. It is clear that at present, willing or unwilling, the households of Punta
                Canoa are paying an enormous price for drinking water, and that this price
                would be reduced substantially if they were connected to ACUACAR's
                system. There is a general assumption, however, that once poor
                communities are connected to the system they fail to pay their water bills.
                By mid-2004 the collection rate for "estrato 1" was 78.1% and for "estrato
                2" was 92.5%; by comparison, the collection rate for the commercial
                business estrato was 82.7%. According to ACUACAR the consumers with
                the largest outstanding bills (other than estrato 1) generally belong to the
                highest estratos.288        To improve water (and sewerage) collection rates in
                poor communities such as Punta Canoa and Manzanillo del Mar,
                ACUACAR will place a water meter at the entrance of the community and
                bill the community for the water consumption. It will then be the
                community's responsibility to collect the payment from each of its
                members.

        247. The question of capacity to pay still lingers. The average household income
                in Punta Canoa is said to be about US$2 a day, or about $60 per month. If
                Punta Canoa were connected to ACUACAR's water distribution system
                today, each Punta Canoa household that consumes 20 cubic meters of water


288Given the low consumption rates and low billings of Estrato 1; a collection rate of 78.1% does not
represent a serious financial constraint to ACUACAR. The collection rate for Estrato 6--the richest
segment of the population--was 89.8%; the average collection rate in mid-2004 for all ACUACAR was
91.7%.


                                                  79

     would be paying a monthly water bill of about US$7, and in 2006 this
     amount will increase to about US$9 as cross-subsidies between estratos are
     reduced considering local income levels. This is an expensive bill to pay.

248. The Panel recognizes that the connection to the water and sewerage
     network is of the utmost importance for the North zone communities.
     However, the Panel did not find any evidence that a formal
     consultation process on all the aspects of water and sewerage issues
     took place with the community of Punta Canoa. The Panel finds that
     the willingness-to-pay surveys did not include Punta Canoa (or
     Manzanillo) and these communities were not adequately consulted on
     the issues of willingness to pay and water tariffs.

CHAPTER FOUR: ECONOMIC COMPLIANCE




                81

1. Economic Evaluation

1.1 The Economic Analysis and Compliance with OP 10.04

       249. The Requesters allege that the Bank failed to comply with OP 10.04 on
               Economic Evaluation of Investment Operations, because, in their opinion, it
               failed to "adequately and effectively scrutinize the economic investment and
               environmental risk evaluations of the outfall and alternative sanitation
               solutions."289 The Requesters also complain that, according to the PAD,
               "ACUACAR has been the primary source of all project data, including
               `data    regarding   market    demand     and    supply,  project   specifics,
               comprehensive cost and investment data, project financing details, expected
               returns, and market distortions."290

       250. OP10.04: Economic Evaluation of Investment Opportunities (September
               1994) includes the following provisions: "1. [...]For every investment
               project, Bank staff conduct economic analysis to determine whether the
               project creates more net benefits to the economy than other mutually
               exclusive options for the use of the resources in question" Paragraph 2 adds
               defines the Criterion for Acceptability as follows: "[t]o be acceptable on
               economic grounds, a project must meet two conditions: (a) the expected
               present value of the project's net benefits must not be negative; and (b) the
               expected present value of the project's net benefits must be higher than or
               equal to the expected net present value of mutually exclusive project
               alternatives." Note 3 states that "standard practice has been to calculate the
               expected internal rate of economic return (...)." Paragraph 3 refers to the
               Analysis of Alternatives as "one of the most important features of proper
               project analysis throughout the project cycle" adding that "[t]o ensure that
               the project maximizes expected net present value, subject to financial,
               institutional, and other constraints, the Bank and the borrower explore
               alternative, mutually exclusive, designs (...)." Paragraph 5 refers to the
               Sustainability of the proposed project and provides that "[t]o obtain a
               reasonable assurance that the project's benefits will materialize as expected
               and will be sustained throughout the life of the project, the Bank assesses
               the robustness of the project with respect to economic, financial,
               institutional, and environmental risks (...)." Acknowledging that the
               "economic analysis of project is based on certain future events and inexact
               data," Paragraph 6 onRisk provides that "[t]he Bank's economic evaluation
               considers the sources, magnitude, and effects of the risks associated with
               the project by taking into account the possible range in the values of the
               basic variables and assessing the robustness of the project's outcome with
               respect to changes in these values (...)." Paragraph 7 on Poverty adds that
               "[t]he economic analysis examines the project's consistency with the Bank's

               poverty reduction strategy.291 If the project is to be included in the Program
               of targeted Interventions, the analysis considers mechanisms for targeting
               the poor." Finally, Paragraph 8 deals with Externalities as follows: "[a]
               project may have domestic, cross-border, or global externalities (...). The
               economic evaluation of Bank-financed projects takes into account any
               domestic and cross-border externalities (...)."

        251. Management responds that "the comprehensive economic analysis carried
               out during project preparation is in compliance with OP 10.04. This
               included the cost efficiency analysis in the FS and the subsequent cost-
               benefit analysis carried out by the Bank team and consultants."292 In
               addition, the Management Response states that a consulting firm,
               Soluciones Integrales, as well as Bank staff conducted "additional
               economic and financial analysis (...) to improve project design and
               eliminate investments for which the estimated return was negative." The
               Response explains that such analysis "included a discussion of non-
               monetary benefits, looked at the project from the financial, economic and
               distributional aspects, assessed the poverty impacts and externalities, and
               included a sensitivity and risk analysis." Management further notes that an
               evaluation of the net fiscal impact "stated that the cost of the project for the
               District of Cartagena would be significant due to future large debt service
               payments. A risk analysis was carried out and subprojects with negative
               benefits were dropped or re-designed to improve project design, and
               increase both net economic benefits and sustainability."

        252. In relation to "the sources and validity of data used" Management informs
               that "ACUACAR was a primary source for data" especially with respect to
               the financial analysis. Additional data included "(i) investment cost data
               from the FS; (ii) a willingness-to-pay study commissioned as part of project
               preparation, which entailed collecting data through a household survey to
               derive demand estimates independent from those provided by ACUACAR;
               and (iii) shadow prices reflecting market distortions that were derived by
               Soluciones Integrales."293

1.1.1 The Material in the Project Appraisal Document

        253. In Bank projects, compliance with OP 10.04 is normally signaled in various
               key parts of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), such as those relating
               to Project Rationale (PAD's Section D) and Summary Project Analysis
               (Section E), and in Annexes that summarize the Economic Analysis and
               include a quantitative analysis of expected net benefits and rates of return.

         254. The Cartagena PAD's Section E: Summary Project Analysis has separate
                economic and financial subheads that report details of the cost-benefit and
                financial analyses that were carried out. Thus there are estimates of
                expected net present values (NPVs) and internal rates of return (IRRs),
                including a probability/risk analysis, financial projections and a sensitivity
                analysis, and significant Institutional, Social and Environmental sub-
                sections. Annex 4 of the PAD, Cost-Benefit Analysis Summary and Annex
                5, Financial Assessment of Project Entities294 augment these analyses, while
                other annexes provide some further relevant information. Section F:
                Sustainability and Risks explores various aspects of risk: sub-section 3, on
                Possible Controversial Aspects discusses two aspects ­ (a) the use of a
                submarine outfall as part of a wastewater treatment and disposal system;
                and (b) tariff increases (those already projected and authorized for
                ACUACAR by the Water Regulating Committee (CRA the Comisión
                Reguladora de Agua) since privatization) ­ and the need because of
                controversy to avoid additional tariff increases over and above the existing
                authorization of the CRA.

         255. Part 1 of the PAD's Section E, The Summary Project Analysis, records the
                following economic indicators from the cost-benefit analysis that was
                carried out:295

                     Type of Indicator                            Total Project
                     Net Present Value (Col.$ billion)            14
                     Internal Rate of Return                      16%
                     Benefit - Cost Ratio (BCR)                   1.17
                     Fiscal Impact (Col.$ billion)                48

                The first three indicators suggest a project that meets the first of the two
                criteria of acceptability in paragraph 1 of OP 10.04.296 The fourth indicator,
                a negative fiscal impact of Col$48 billion, is "due to the large capital
                subsidies for the sewage collection and treatment infrastructure. Although
                the overall fiscal impact is negative, the Central Government is actually
                benefiting from the project, and most of the costs of this project are hence
                being borne by the District of Cartagena. The distributive analysis shows
                that especially the consumers will gain from the implementation of the
                project. Also ACUACAR will substantially benefit from this project,
                especially the water supply sub-component will generate substantial
                incremental revenues."297 We will return to the issue of the distribution of
                costs and benefits later, in the discussion of Annex 4 of the PAD.

294This Annex is discussed in the earlier chapter on financial evaluation.
295PAD, p. 15
296OP 10.04: "To be acceptable on economic grounds, a project must meet two conditions: (a) the expected
present value of the project's net benefits must not be negative; and (b) the expected present value of the
project's net benefits must be higher than or equal to the expected net present value of mutually exclusive
project alternatives."
297PAD, p.16.

        256. Section E notes that the economic feasibility of the overall Project, "was
                determined by evaluating all infrastructure subprojects, that account for
                more than 88 percent of the total project costs."298 Most but not all of the
                subprojects are said to be economically viable. In water supply, two
                subprojects (in Falda de la Popa and Zonas de Invasión) were dropped
                because of this; the project in Zona de Norte was dropped because it was
                profitable and so could be easily financed privately by ACUACAR and two
                other projects (in El Pozón and Plan Barrios) were to be re-designed or
                dropped. Two of the sewage collection subprojects (in El Pozón and Paseo
                Bolivar) just failed to meet the cut-off 12% internal rate of return (IRR), but
                were in very poor neighborhoods, and it is argued that there could be a
                social rationale to include these subprojects because "the willingness to pay
                for sewerage services only partially captures the environmental and public
                health benefits related to this service."299 Consequently, it was
                recommended that they be redesigned to ensure viability. Because the risk
                analysis suggests an inverse relationship between the economic viability of
                the subprojects and their risk profiles, it is recommended that projects with
                an internal rate of return of 12% or below be redesigned, to decrease their
                risks.300

        257. Part 2 of the PAD's Section E summarizes the financial analysis. Section E
                warns that the project's financial success, in terms of timely provision of
                counterpart funding and debt service coverage, is heavily dependent on the
                District's capacity to improve tax collection rates and on the stability of the
                exchange rate. The financial analysis and the role of the exchange rate in the
                projections have been addressed later in the Panel's report.

        258. Part 3 of Section E of the PAD discusses the selection and analysis of
                alternatives. This issue was raised specifically in the Request and is
                addressed separately in the section on the economic evaluation of
                alternatives.

        259. Section F of the PAD addresses Sustainability and Risks and notes various
                measures that will be taken to mitigate risk, both in relation to the
                performance (and operational independence) of ACUACAR and the
                capacity of the District to provide counterpart funding and pay debt service
                in a timely manner.301 It also states that "Consultations with different
                stakeholders will reduce the risk of objection to the selected option to
                reduce water pollution in the city."302 In Part 2, a table of seven Critical

               Risks gives each a risk rating, ultimately aggregating them into an overall
               risk rating of modest risk.303 The table also summarizes various risk
               minimization measures.

        260. Part 3 of Section F discusses Possible Controversial Aspects and identifies
               two issues, the use of a submarine outfall as part of a wastewater treatment
               and disposal system, which it suggests "may cause some controversy due to
               lack of understanding of the technology,"304 and the planned increase in
               tariffs. It is acknowledged that "[t]he authorized annual tariff increase is a
               controversial issue, and ACUACAR considers that it will become more and
               more difficult to generate the corresponding revenues." The PAD further
               notes that no tariff increases are planned as part of the proposed Project, and
               states that "[t]he potential controversy was the reason for avoiding
               additional tariff increase, over and above the existing authorization of the
               CRA. As a result, the additional financing will now be paid through the
               national and municipal government through an implicit policy that will
               subsidize sewage treatment investments."305

        261. This section of the PAD also cites average tariff levels and projected
               increases in them. However, these averages provide no information
               about any differential effects on different groups in the population.
               This is relevant because it is an issue of some potential significance,
               particularly where poorer groups are concerned.                              In its financial
               projections in Annex 5, the PAD notes that "[i]n the base case scenario, we
               are conservatively assuming the following: (i) real increase in average
               tariff of 7%, 4%, and 0.9% per year in 1999, 2000, and 2001 respectively,
               but almost 90% increase in category 1 and 2 customers (following the
               guidelines of the National Tariff Law)."306 This makes the omission of the
               differential effects of tariffs surprising.

        262. The Panel observes, however, that there is little discussion about
               connection fees for access to new water and sewerage services, although
               they are potentially controversial and might influence the economic
               performance of the Project, particularly in relation to poorer
               consumers, as previous Bank experience confirms.

         263. Annex 4 summarizes the cost benefit analysis and says that the conclusion
                 of "a detailed financial, economic and distributive analysis, enhanced by
                 elaborate sensitivity and risk analyses," is that the Project "is financially
                 and economically viable when some of the components of the project will be
                 either redesigned or discarded from the investment program." The cost
                 benefit analysis was used to measure: "(i) the financial and economic
                 viability of the investment projects that will be partially financed by the
                 Bank; and (ii) the distributive impact of those subprojects; and (iii) the risk
                 profile of each subproject." 307

         264. The PAD states that the steps undertaken in the cost benefit analysis
                 included: specifying the `with' project scenario (i.e. including "the
                 proposed investments and their associated                targets") and the 'without'
                 scenario ("current coverage levels will be maintained over time") for each
                 subproject - and projecting them until the full impact of the subprojects
                 occurs; identifying project components; carrying out willingness to pay
                 studies; analyzing the benefits of the water supply projects; and preparing
                 the financial and economic analyses of the water supply, sewage collection
                 and treatment subprojects.308 The PAD notes that the evaluated
                 infrastructure components represent 88 percent of the total project cost. The
                 Panel finds that no description or explanation is offered in relation to
                 the remaining 12 per cent.

         265. Thus, to identify the incremental costs and benefits from each subproject,
                 `with' and `without' project scenarios for each of them were assembled and
                 projected for 30 years, "that is, during the implementation period and until
                 the full impact of the subprojects is obtained."309 However, the Soluciones
                 Integrales Cost Benefit Analysis Study's Final Report (SI CBA), which
                 provided significant parts of the background data and analysis for the
                 PAD's cost-benefit analysis, says that "[t]he project's analysis horizon is
                 20 years of operation,"310 and to evaluate the sewage treatment and sewage
                 collection subprojects they used periods of 21 years and 25 years,
                 respectively.311 The cash flows in the PAD were then discounted312 at a rate

311The lengthening of the time horizon might have some limited effect of increasing the present value of
the net benefits ­ because the major investment costs happen at the beginning of the project so that in later
years, apart possibly from some replacement of equipment, the costs would be mainly O & M and the full
benefits would continue to flow, although heavily discounted over the later years.
312Discounting is the process whereby the values of future effects are adjusted to make them comparable to
the values placed on current costs and benefits, because a given amount of future costs or benefits is worth
less than the same amount experienced today.

                of 12 per cent, estimated to be a proxy of Colombia's cost of capital, in
                order to estimate present values and rates of return on the subprojects.

        266. The estimated benefits from the water supply subprojects included "the
                elimination of rationing and intermittent supplies and service coverage
                increases." The benefits from sewage collection and treatment subprojects
                included a reduction of water pollution levels through service coverage
                increases ("[t]he improved hygienic and environmental conditions that
                result from increasing water supply and sewerage coverage will translate
                into improved hygienic conditions that will result in decreases in infant
                mortality and a reduction in the incidence of water-borne diseases").
                However, according to the PAD, although improved environmental
                conditions contribute to the recovery of beaches, enhance tourism activities
                and other water uses, and increase recreational activities, "no effort is made
                to quantify these benefits."313

        267. The PAD notes that the project is evaluated from several viewpoints. (a) A
                financial viewpoint: the "financial viability of each subproject is appraised
                measuring its flows of costs and benefits in market prices. Under a financial
                perspective, benefits are assumed equal to the estimated flow of financial
                revenues." But it notes that, "[b]ecause of the particular financing structure
                of this project, a very large part of the investments are actually subsidized;"
                (b) an economic viewpoint: "[t]he economic viability is determining the
                flows of costs and benefits in economic or shadow prices." And it is said
                that this matters particularly "because of the project's intangible
                environmental benefits."          Here, "benefits are assumed equal to the
                willingness to pay (WTP) for sewage collection, treatment and disposal
                services for each beneficiary household." However, "As no WTP studies
                were undertaken for the water supply subprojects, as they were added on to
                the project in a later stage, it was generally assumed that current water
                rates reflect customers' willingness to pay." (We return to this issue below.)
                And, it is explained that to obtain the values for the economic analysis,
                "[t]he flow of financial cost is transformed into economic costs through the
                use of conversion factors."314 Thirdly, the project is evaluated (c) from a
                distributional viewpoint: "[t]he distributive analysis identifies the winners
                and losers among the different groups with interests and stakes in the
                project (...)."     It is also said that "[t]he sensitivity and risk analysis
                enhances the accuracy of the financial and economic analyses by
                incorporating uncertainty into the project analysis."

        268. Annex 4, Part III (Assumptions), outlines the data sources and assumptions
                used in the analyses. It notes that ACUACAR was the primary source of
                data    "regarding       market    demand       and     supply,    project     specifics,


313PAD, p. 51. The PAD also argues that, "Additional benefits, that were not included in the analysis,
comprise of a temporary but significant generation of jobs during project implementation."
314All quotations in this paragraph are from the PAD, p. 51.

               comprehensive cost and investment data, project financing details, expected
               financial returns, and market distortions."315 These data include coverage
               levels. However, no reference is made as to whether the Bank
               performed any checks on the validity and reliability of these data,
               although they formed essential building blocks for the analyses. The
               Panel finds that, even though it would not have been feasible to
               scrutinize and validate all parts of these data, the PAD should have
               examined the issue of data reliability as part of showing compliance
               with OP 10.04.

        269. The PAD also states that in April 1998 consultants carried out a willingness
               to pay survey for sewage collection, treatment and final disposal in different
               areas of intervention.316 As noted above, the same process was not repeated
               in relation to water supply. The PAD concludes that because of government
               subsidies to almost all investments, their "actual financial costs are
               negligible."317

        270. The PAD notes that the "[w]ater billed for metered connections is based on
               the volume of water billed multiplied by the average water tariff. Sewage
               billed is assumed equal to the sewage volume given by the number of
               connections, and the average tariff for the appropriate income groups."
               The PAD does not explain whether water billing took into account the
               six-part tariff structure for different income groups. In all scenarios the
               collection rate was assumed to stay constant, at 85% (As noted in Chapter
               Five of this report "[d]uring the first six months of 2004 the collection rate
               was 91.71%, a large improvement over the 85.2% rate achieved in 2002
               and 2003").318 Tariff structures and levels were assumed to change between
               1998 and 2001 for the `with' project scenario, while the responsiveness of
               demand to changes in price (the price elasticity) was estimated to be -0.28
               and in income (income elasticity) to be 0.41.319 Also, "[i]t is assumed that
               the introduction of sewage treatment will not result into the establishment of
               a separate tariff for sewage treatment."320 This leads to the anomaly that in
               the financial analysis there are no corresponding benefits.

      272. Table 1 suggests that all the sewage collection and treatment subprojects,
              except one sewage collection project, in Crespo-El Oro, have insufficient
              benefits to justify these investments on financial grounds. But the PAD says
              that when the investment subsidies are taken into account, all of the
              subprojects generate positive financial returns except, of course, the sewage
              treatment subproject.321

      273. For water, the system improvement project (which, amongst other things,
              aims at eliminating rationing and intermittent supplies) appears financially
              viable (internal rate of return at 13%) on the basis of revenues anticipated
              through resulting increases in consumption. However, Table 1 suggests that
              even after "sharp real rate increases for especially the poor(est) customers"
              associated with a change in cross-subsidies (as noted, poor customers in
              strata 1 and 2 would have to pay about 90% higher rates between 1998 and
              2001), only one of the expansion of water supply subprojects ­ that in Zona
              Suroriental - is financially viable. However, is also said that: "[t]he
              subproject "Zona Norte" is highly beneficial due to the large benefits it
              generates because of the future development of this area, resulting in the
              construction of up-scale residences and the construction of hotels to cater
              the development of tourism (the latter benefit has not been quantified). In
              addition, the project will benefit households in three poor communities in
              this area. As a result, net benefits are very high and the internal rate of
              return of this subproject is 38 percent."322

         274. The PAD notes that each subproject's economic viability was appraised
                after converting financial cash flows into economic cash flows through the
                use of conversion factors and of willingness to pay (WTP) estimates that
                included "the use and non-use values of water supply and sewerage
                services." These flows were then also discounted at 12 per cent.

         275. The conversion factors were applied to "eliminate market distortions
                created by taxes, tariffs and subsidies, add a premium on foreign exchange
                on the tradable components of each input, and account for any changes in
                domestic prices that may occur as a result of the project."323 It is noted that
                "[a]ll economic costs of the project inputs are lower than the market costs
                due to the high taxes and tariffs charged in Colombia that offset the impact
                of the foreign exchange premium."324

         276. Data from contingent valuation (i.e. hypothetical valuation) surveys of
                willingness to pay325 for improved sewerage services were used (i) "to
                capture the non-use value of sewage disposal services (...);" and (ii) "to
                study the perceived value of sewerage services vis-à-vis their current
                prices."326

         277. The PAD says that separate surveys of WTP were carried out: (a) for
                improved sewerage collection; and (b) for improved sewerage treatment
                services, to reflect differences in the areas to be affected by these two
                elements of the project. In (a) surveys for sewage collection were conducted
                for 500 households in the districts of Campanos, El Pozon, La Boquilla and
                Zona Suroccidental. WTP estimates for the three other project areas
                (Crespo, Paseo Bolivar and Zona Suroriental) "were taken from the survey
                localities most similar to those project areas." The Soluciones Integrales
                Cost-Benefit study, which reports on these surveys, explains that this was
                because of changes in the project: "[t]he three sub-basins where the survey
                was not performed were included in the program after the execution of the
                field work. For the determination of the WTP, they were assimilated to the
                El Pozón sub-basin."327

         278. The WTP study for sewage collection and treatment was conducted over
                500 households in the city of Cartagena "as this subproject will benefit the
                total population of the city."328 The results of the surveys are summarized in
                Table 3 of Annex 4, reproduced below.

325The SI CBA study explains (English translation, p. 12): "This methodology bases the analysis on the
execution of a careful process of interviewing the project beneficiaries with the aim of obtaining from them
a willingness to pay for it. Following economic theory, this declared willingness to pay, in hypothetical (or
contingent) conditions, is then the measure of the project benefits."

       279. The WTP estimates in Table 3 were sourced from the SI CBA study, which
              in Part II used a process known as "benefits transfer", in which a WTP
              equation estimated from a survey carried out in a "study by the Inter
              American Development Bank for the part of the city that drains into the
              Bay,"329 was used to adjust the WTPs estimated for the Bay
              neighborhoods330 by estimating for each project to be evaluated in the
              Lagoon neighborhoods the average value for each independent variable in
              the equation.331 The CBA study suggests, however, that an attempt to
              validate the use of the benefits transfer procedure from the Bay study
              "seemed to confirm the results observed in the focus groups and some
              in-depth interviews according to which there would indeed be less
              willingness to pay for sewerage in the Lagoon neighborhoods, and possibly
              that the simple application of the benefit transfer method has a limited
              validity. [...] one of the main conclusions from said focus groups was that
              "there seems to be NO significant concern in these neighborhoods about
              the sewerage issue in comparison with neighborhoods of similar
              socioeconomic level in the Bay basin. A greater relative deficiency is
              noticed in various services, including water, electricity and garbage
              collection."332 It also goes on to put forward, however, several reasons why
              the WTP estimates for the lagoon might be understated. Overall, it
              concludes that, "probably the direct use of the values [i.e. those in Table
              No. 3.2,      cited in Table 3] representing a simple transfer between the
              benefits estimated in the neighborhoods of the Bay and those of the Lagoon,
              overestimates the true willingness to pay [p. 16] for the works (...). It is
              therefore suggested that for the purposes of the economic evaluation of the

               works, the figures [...] are adopted as base case, and figures 23% lower are
               considered as a sensitivity level test."333

         280. The PAD's Table 3 suggests that average WTP for sewage collection varies
               between Col.$14570 and Col.$20230 per household per month (US$8.89 to
               US$12.35, at the exchange rate used in the PAD). The Table's third column
               estimates the WTP to be around three times the current bill, and that it also
               amounts to around 5% of average income. A comparison between the
               PAD's figures of household WTP as a percentage of income and
               corresponding figures obtainable from the SI CBA suggests, however, that
               each of the CBA's figures is 0.7% higher than those in the PAD, with
               values ranging from 5.5% to 6.4% of income, compared with the PAD's
               4.8% to 5.7%.334

         281.    The PAD comments that around 5% of average income seems a high
               percentage and acknowledges that while it could indicate the urgent need
               felt for sewage collection projects in poor neighborhoods, "It is likely that
               because of the separate surveys, households tend to overlook their budget
               constraints and hence have overestimated their overall WTP for water
               supply, sewage collection, treatment and final disposal." It promises that
               these "very high levels" of WTP will be tested in more detail in the
               sensitivity analysis.335 The Panel notes, however, that the PAD's
               sensitivity analysis does not report the responsiveness of net present
               values to variations in WTP.

         282. A review of the use of contingent valuation methods in project analysis at
               the Inter-American Development Bank,336 published the year before the
               PAD, cites several `Contingent Valuation Estimates of Willingness to Pay
               for Local Sewer and Drainage'. In its Table 1 mean WTP and monthly
               income data are cited for nine out of thirteen projects in four countries,
               including the IDB project in Cartagena (CO-0227). On average, households
               were willing to pay three per cent of their income each month to have a
               sewer connection and drainage services, while the values for individual
               projects ranged from 2.6% to 7.7% (the IDB Cartagena project value cited
               was 6.7%). This suggests that the percentages in the PAD's Table 3 may lie
               at the high end of experience.

         283. Table 3's estimate of household monthly WTP for sewage treatment at
               Col.$9227 (US$5.63) comes from Part I of the SI CBA, which states that "it

                represents around 2.3% of the reported monthly income of the family."337
                However, in a garbled sentence the PAD suggests that the WTP338 is at 1%
                of average income. The CBA suggests that Col.$9227 "is considered to be
                reasonable." It is not clear why the PAD suggests only 1%.

         284. The SI CBA explains how the sewage treatment WTP estimate was
                developed, through applying econometric estimation methods to "data
                gathered by means of a survey of a representative sample of 500 heads of
                household of the city of Cartagena, Colombia, conducted between April 18
                and 27, 1998."339         With a population of almost 135000 households in
                Cartagena in 1998, this represents a sample of less than 0.4%. "However, a
                preliminary analysis of the information showed that there is a potential
                representativeness bias in the data. [...] when the number of houses
                connected to the water network is tabulated according to the socioeconomic
                strata they belong to), a significant divergence is observed with the records
                of Aguas de Cartagena and other data available at the city level."
                Consequently, "The sample importantly subrepresents the number of cases
                in strata 1, 2 and 6, and over-represents strata 3 and 4." To avoid biased
                estimates, "it was decided to correct the sample ex post to ensure an
                adequately balanced representativeness of the same." The study correctly
                suggests that, "It is not unusual to have important discrepancies in the
                distribution of individual variables in samples that are relatively small with
                respect to the population" 340 It is worth noting, however, that the study of
                the benefits of improved water quality anticipated by beach-using residents
                of Cartagena,341 discussed below, used a significantly larger sample of 1200
                Cartagena residents.

         285. In the SI CBA the survey and the econometric estimation relating to the
                enhanced sewage treatment were designed to capture benefits perceived by
                City residents: "[...] it is assumed that all those benefits that are correctly
                perceived by the populating residing in Cartagena are measured, and [...]
                there is a rigorous inclusion both of the benefits associated to enabling
                recreational uses of the Bay and the Lagoon as the reduction of health risks
                associated to the consumption of sea products and eliminating the
                disturbances caused by bad odors (due to the death of fish). [...] the
                emphasis of the analysis is placed in connection with the improvements
                linked to the clean up of the Lagoon."342

         286. The SI CBA then explains that the WTP estimates do not cover all of the
                 benefits that might be expected to flow from the sewage treatment works:
                 "From the above, this study does not consider the potential benefits to be
                 perceived by the Colombian tourists visiting the city nor the potential
                 benefits for the Colombian economy that would result from a greater flow
                 of foreign tourists. On the other hand, the effect of the project on the
                 commercial activities connected with fishing or the exploitation of these
                 natural resources is not considered either."343

         287. With much less clarity, the PAD says that, "Other benefits arising from
                 improved environmental conditions that will contribute to the recovery of
                 beaches, enhance tourism activities and other water uses, and increase
                 recreational activities have not been quantified. Preliminary studies show
                 that these benefits can be substantially (sic)."344 It references the Ibañez et
                 al. study of the benefits of improved water quality in Cartagena Bay, noting
                 that "Using a travel cost method, the annual benefits of improved water
                 quality by beach users was estimated at US$969,000."345 This latter study,
                 however, only refers to benefits experienced by beach users who are
                 residents of Cartagena ­ and it is not made clear in the PAD that these
                 benefits are likely to overlap partially with those estimated in the SI CBA
                 willingness to pay survey of Cartagena.

         288. However, the Panel finds that the PAD did not try to make further -
                 necessarily approximate - estimates of the enhanced tourism and
                 recreational benefits likely to be associated with the project, which is
                 surprising given the acknowledged importance of tourism to the
                 economy of Cartagena.

         289. The PAD notes that tourism is the main income source in the city and
                 quotes 700,000 annual visitors and estimated revenues of US$315
                 million generated. The Panel finds that the Bank should have
                 considered these benefits in order to be consistent with OP 10.04, which
                 says that: "The economic evaluation of Bank-financed projects takes into
                 account any domestic and cross-border externalities." Such estimates
                 might possibly have been attempted using a `benefit transfer approach'
                 (analogous to that used in Part II of the SI CBA, see below) and hence
                 drawing on other existing studies from Colombia or elsewhere.

345Ana Maria Ibañez, Nancy Lozano Garcia and Kenneth McConnell, The Benefits of Improving Water
Quality in Cartagena Bay, Colombia, Sept. 1998. The study used two approaches to estimating WTP, the
travel cost method and a contingent valuation approach: "Thus moderate estimates from each method
bracket the [present value of] benefits from improved water between five and ten million dollars," p. 20,
[hereinafter the "Ibañez et al. study]. The first value was from the contingent valuation method and the
second from the travel cost approach.


                                                       95

          290. The PAD says that WTP studies were not undertaken for the water supply
                 "as they were added on to the project in a later stage [...]."                          346

                 Consequently, "For improved water supplies, it has been assumed that the
                 willingness to pay of existing customers is equal to the increased financial
                 revenues because of higher monthly consumption as rationing is
                 eliminated."347 Moreover, "For the expansion of water supply services in
                 poor neighborhoods, water consumption levels in other poor neighborhoods
                 are used as a yardstick, and multiplied by the average tariff levels for the
                 lowest income groups."          348  This approach, i.e. valuing enhanced water
                 consumption and reliability at parity with the tariff, is strikingly different
                 from the estimates of the WTP for improved sewage collection (Table 3
                 above), where WTP was valued at around three times the value of the
                 current bill. The PAD does not explain why it was judged reasonable to
                 assume that the tariff charged to a particular group/stratum would
                 appropriately reflect the expected benefit from/willingness to pay for
                 enhanced water supplies, nor does it discuss the circumstances in which this
                 approach might be expected to lead either to an under or an overestimate.
                 Moreover, as noted, the tariff levels themselves changed markedly during
                 the early period of the project, with high increases for the poorest groups.
                 Given that the Bank and other international agencies have carried out
                 or sponsored numerous studies of willingness to pay for water and of
                 water tariffs,349 the Panel              expected the PAD's economic analysis
                 explicitly to draw on and comment on this experience, in order to
                 explain and validate the approach taken to valuing the benefits of
                 improved water services. The Panel observes that the economic analysis
                 does not do so.

          291. Table 4 of Annex 4 of the PAD presents the results of the economic
                 analysis. These results were developed by converting the financial flows in
                 Table 1, through the introduction of the WTP estimates (which would be
                 expected to raise the value of the benefits to which they are applied) and
                 through the use of conversion factors (shadow prices), which range between
                 zero and less than one.350 It is noted that "All economic costs of the project

347Earlier in the PAD (p. 16), it is also suggested that for the water supply subprojects "economic benefits
are estimated to be reflected by the current water rates, which are adjusted for the impact of shadow
pricing."

              inputs are lower than the market costs due to the high taxes and tariffs
              charged in Colombia that offset the impact of the foreign exchange
              premium."351 The economic analysis results, discounted at 12%, "improve
              the financial estimates significantly."352 However, they do so in a non-
              uniform manner, which is not clearly explained. A comparison of the
              financial benefits, in Table 1, and the economic benefits, in Table 4, shows
              that for the sewage collection subprojects the ratios of the economic to the
              financial values range between 1.1 and 3.9, although the ratios of the WTP
              to the current bill in Table 3 only range between 2.8 and 3.2. While there
              may be sound reasons for these big differences, an explanation is not
              offered. In the water supply subprojects, where water rates are assumed to
              reflect WTP, the ratios of the economic to financial flows lie between 0.9
              and 1.4,353 on which again no comment is made.

       292. For the sewage treatment subprojects, Table 4 suggests that although the
              economic net benefits are higher than the financial net benefits, two of the
              projects (El Pozón and Paseo Bolivar) had internal rates of return which lay
              below the cut-off rate of 12%. Nevertheless, the PAD asserts that they "are
              very reasonable for sewage collection projects, especially taken into
              account that they serve the poorest populations of Cartagena," although it
              is not explained why it would be reasonable to expect a social cost benefit

353As expected, this is a much narrower range than in the sewage collection case.

               analysis of a sewage collection project to be economically unviable. The
               PAD goes on to suggest the (more reasonable) possibility that the actual
               benefits had been understated because not all of the externalities of sewage
               collection had been valued. Nevertheless, it recommends "that these two
               projects be redesigned so as to ensure that they will generate sufficient cash
               flow."354 The sewage treatment project has positive net benefits and an
               internal rate of return of 15%, well above the cut-off rate.

        293. There are, however, significant differences between the estimates for the
               discounted present values of net benefits and internal rates of return (IRRs)
               of the sewage collection subprojects in the PAD's Table 4 and the earlier
               estimates given in Tables 4.1 to 4.7 of Part II of the SI CBA. For example,
               whereas in the PAD five out of seven subprojects (more than two thirds)
               have positive net benefits, only two of the seven (less than one third) in the
               SI CBA have positive net benefits. Correspondingly, while the IRRs in the
               PAD range from 8% to 171%, with five greater than or equal to the cut-off
               rate of 12%, the IRRs in the CBA range from 3% to 49%, with only two
               that exceed 12%. The estimates in the PAD and the CBA are both
               discounted at 12%, although the time periods differ: the PAD's scenarios
               are projected for 30 years, while those in the SI CBA run for 21 years.

        294. In Table 4 of the PAD, the sewage treatment project yields a positive net
               benefit of nearly $4 billion and an IRR of 15%. There are, however,
               significant differences between these estimates and the earlier estimate
               given in the SI CBA. In terms of the overall outcomes, while the PAD
               shows net benefits of almost Col.$4 billion and an IRR of 15%; the SI CBA
               shows corresponding figures of Col.$27 billion with an 18% IRR. The
               major difference lies in the Col.$20 billion gap in benefits: the PAD's
               benefit estimate is Col.$56.6 billion while the CBA's estimate is more than
               one third larger, at Col.$76.7 billion.355           Both reports discounted flows at
               12%, although the CBA considers flows for 25 years between 1999 and
               2024,356 whereas the PAD assumes 30 years. Both used the WTP estimate
               of Col.$9,227 per household per month that was developed in the CBA's
               contingent valuation exercise. Similar issues arise to those raised in relation
               to the estimates for the sewage collection subprojects ­ but with the key
               difference that in this case the net benefits and IRR are very much lower in
               the PAD than in the SI CBA.

355"The above value, converted into a social price by applying the standard conversion factor of 0.915,
was applied to all the families residing in Cartagena, which in 1998 represented around 135,000 and
growing at the rate of 2.18% per year. Thus, the present value of these benefits, accounted for between
2004 and 2024 and discounted at 12%, amounted to Col.$ 76.7 billion." (SI CBA study, Executive
Summary (English translation), p. ii).

      295. The PAD text says that the water supply `system improvement' project
              generates a positive net benefit of Col.$910 million (although Table 4
              actually shows Col.$950 million, which is the difference between benefits
              and costs) and an internal rate of return of 14%, above the cut-off rate of
              12%. Except for the project in Zona Suroriental, the water supply
              subprojects do not produce positive net benefits and so they yield internal
              rates of return of less than 12%. The PAD suggests that these
              underperforming subprojects be either redesigned or "dropped off the
              current project."357 The Zona Norte subproject was dropped from the
              project because of "the need to scale it down" and its high profitability
              meant that it could be easily financed privately by ACUACAR.

      296. Table 4 also indicates that the project as a whole, now excluding the water
              supply projects in Falda de la Popa, the Zonas de Invasión and Zona Norte
              and allowing for adjustments in the system improvement subproject, yields
              net benefits of Col.$13.8 billion and an internal rate of return of 16%, well
              above the 12% cut-off rate.


1.1.4 Distribution of Benefits

      297. The analysis of the distribution of benefits from the project is briefly
              outlined in section VI of Annex 4 of the PAD, Distributive Analysis. It

         298. Section VI is intended to identify "who benefits and who pays for the costs
                 of the subprojects." The analysis finds that "The big winners are the
                 customers of ACUACAR, but also ACUACAR and other shareholders that
                 realize benefits in the form of dividend payments..." (See bottom row of
                 Table 5).      Benefits to consumers are explained thus: "Consumption
                 externalities result from the prices that are actually charged and the WTP
                 for water supply and sanitation services. Consumption externalities for the
                 total projects are positive and estimated at C$68 billion."              358  The first
                 column of Table 5, `Consumers', suggests that while they gain benefits
                 from the sewage collection and treatment projects, they lose from three of
                 the water supply expansion projects. However, the reasons for the disparity
                 are not discussed. It may be that a part of the losses in these three projects
                 and some of the differences between the flows of financial and economic
                 benefits in Tables 1 and 4 is explained by connection costs. During the draft
                 PAD's internal review process, one peer reviewer commented that "It will
                 be important to know how connection fees will be handled as the
                 neighborhood environmental benefits depend directly on a high connection
                 level (from current 65% level up to 90% by project end)."359 However, as
                 noted earlier, there appears to be little discussion of connection costs to new
                 water and sewerage services            in the PAD (except for a component of
                 "support to in house basic sanitation at La Boquilla,"360 associated with the
                 social management program.               The Panel finds this a potentially
                 important issue for consumers and the utility, and much may depend
                 on how it is addressed, particularly in relation to poorer consumers, as
                 previous Bank experience confirms.361

         299. In relation to other stakeholders, "the net fiscal impact for the District of
                 Cartagena will be very negative at almost C$61 billion" (mainly through
                 the debt service payments relating to repayment of the World Bank loan),
                 while the central government experiences a positive net fiscal impact of
                 Col.$13 billion, because of tax income generated. The sewerage projects
                 are a "drain on the government's resources"362 through capital subsidies,
                 while the remaining water supply projects generate incremental tax
                 revenues to offset their subsidies. While ACUACAR's gain is Col.$16
                 billion, its workers also gain Col.$6 billion through wage premiums.

1.1.5 Poverty Impact Analysis

        300. The poverty impact analysis in Section VII of Annex 4 of the PAD, which
               "measures how much of the consumer benefits accrue to poorer
               consumers," is treated in Table 6 and eight lines of text. The PAD says that
               the income data collected during the WTP surveys363 made it "impossible to
               calculate with any accuracy the impact of the project on the poor." The
               Panel finds this a surprising omission, in a project explicitly aimed at
               improving water and sewerage services to the city's poorest
               population,364 and where ­ as with many projects that may benefit poor
               people ­ because there is the possibility that some of the poor may gain
               and others lose, `accuracy' may matter.                   We return to this in the
               discussion on Poverty Reduction, in Section 4.3 below.

1.1.6 Sensitivity and Risk Analysis

        301. Section VIII of Annex 4 of the PAD describes the sensitivity and risk
               analysis. It reports that this analysis "defined the following major risk
               variables: investment cost overruns, project delays, changes in the
               unaccounted for water, labor productivity, collection efficiency and the
               willingness to pay for access to new or improved services." The PAD then
               says that "Most of these variables are largely beyond management
               control,365 with the exception of the willingness to pay for access to or an
               improvement in water and sewerage services which is based on consumer's
               preferences and is largely beyond management control."366 Below this,
               Table 7, entitled Risk Variables and their Impact and Risk Significance,
               names and describes seven variables, only three of which are included in the
               previous list of `major risk variables'. It then says that "The risk analysis
               recalculated the results of the financial and economic analysis by changing
               these major risk variables all at the same time using the Crystal Ball
               software."367

        302. However, it is unclear whether these `major risk variables' include all of the
               ten overlapping variables in the text's list of six `major risk variables' and
               Table 7's seven `Risk Variables.' The PAD is unhelpful here because it
               only sets out the probability distributions and ranges that were used for five
               of the variables. There is no obvious reason why this was not done for
               the remaining variables and it makes it impossible for the reader to
               gain a full picture of the procedures, underlying rationales and results


363Which, in any case, did not cover " improved water supplies and expansion of water supplied in the
poorest neighborhoods" (PAD, p. 56).

367This appropriately enables a Monte Carlo analysis to be performed, yielding distributions for the net
present values.

              of the sensitivity and risk analysis. It was noted earlier, for example, that
              the PAD commented on the "very high levels" of WTP for sewage services
              and stated that they would be tested in more detail in the sensitivity
              analysis.368 However, although it is recorded in the PAD that for the WTP
              for sewage services a normal distribution was used with a standard
              deviation of 20 per cent, the analysis does not discuss the responsiveness of
              net present values to variations in WTP. And, although OP 10.04 says that
              "The analysis estimates the switching values of key variables (i.e., the value
              that each variable must assume to reduce the net present value of the
              project to zero)[...]" the economic sensitivity analysis does not mention
              them. The presentation of the sensitivity and risk analysis in this Part of the
              PAD compares relatively poorly with the more detailed corresponding
              presentation in the Financial Assessment (Annex 5 and Attachment 3),
              which - amongst other details - does present switching values. In the
              Panel's view, therefore, the PAD's sensitivity and risk analysis is
              inadequate under OP 10.04's provisions relating to risk.

       303. The results of the economic risk analysis, in terms of the probability of
              positive net present values and their means, are shown in Table 8. The PAD
              comments that "the projects that turn out to be unviable have high risk
              profiles, while the projects that are economically viable in general have low
              risk profiles."369 For the sewage collection and treatment projects, the three
              projects with internal rates of return below the cut-off 12% rate -
              Campanos, El Pozón and Paseo Bolivar - also show low probabilities of
              generating net positive benefits, while the others have probabilities of doing
              this that range between 60% and 100%.370 "However, the sewage treatment
              project has a sufficient rate of return, yet the risk involved in this project is
              substantial." 371

1.1.7 Conclusions of the Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) Summary372

       304. The PAD's cost benefit analysis summary concludes that "The Cartagena
              project looks sufficiently robust if the non-viable subprojects will be either
              redesigned or dropped from the project. The water supply expansion
              subprojects - with the exception of that in Zona Suroriental - can not be
              justified on economic grounds, and should not to be undertaken in their
              current form." And, despite their possibly substantial health and
              environmental benefits in poor neighborhoods "that are not captured in
              individual households' willingness to pay," it recommends that the two
              "currently unviable sewage collection projects as well as the subproject in

              redesigned to ensure their long-term sustainability."

        305. It is stated that "All other subprojects will generate substantial net benefits
              to society. [...]," and it is argued that all the main stakeholders" will reap
              benefits when the subprojects are being implemented." However, the PAD
              comments that there are distinct differences between the patterns of fiscal
              impact of the sewerage and water supply projects: "The water supply
              subprojects show a positive net fiscal impact, while the sewerage projects
              show a negative fiscal impact. The total fiscal impact of the project is
              negative at C$48 billion. However, the distribution of these benefits are
              rather unequal, with the central government benefiting from additional tax
              revenues will see a total positive net benefit of C$13 billion, while the
              impact on the District of Cartagena will be negative at almost C$6 1
              billion."373

        306. The appraisal in Annex 4 is a curious mixture of sophistication and
              carelessness.       It has used modern, sophisticated methods of analysis,
              including contingent valuation estimates of WTP and Monte Carlo
              approaches to sensitivity and risk analysis, yet it gives signs (e.g. textual
              slips, inconsistencies and poor proof-reading) of having been written up
              carelessly or hurriedly. The fact that, in relation to the sewage collection
              WTP surveys, the SI Cost-Benefit study says that "The three sub-basins
              where the survey was not performed were included in the program after the
              execution of the field work,"374 while WTP studies were not undertaken for
              the water supply projects "as they were added on to the project in a later
              stage [...],"   375 and the fact that the benefit, cost, NPV and IRR values for
              some of the projects differ between the October 1998 SI CBA report and the
              June 1999 PAD, suggest a rapidly evolving project, with significant
              changes in the period leading up to the PAD. This may have been driven
              partly by the project's third development objective, to "improve the
              sustainability of water and sewerage services in Cartagena by leveraging
              Bank support to shore up the private sector participation (PSP) model
              pioneered by ACUACAR [...], against the prospect of political
              interference."376

        307. In the Panel's view, although the underlying economic evaluation may
              have been carried out competently and broadly in line with OP 10.04,
              parts of the material in Annex 4 are not presented and explained in the
              PAD with sufficient clarity, transparency and consistency to
              demonstrate this compliance. This matters because partial or confusing
              explanations in the PAD risk failing successfully to communicate and

               confirm to stakeholders the nature and robustness of the appraisal
               processes that the Bank's operational procedures like OP 10.04
               promote and require. This could be important for a project that is
               acknowledged to have controversial aspects.377

2 The Economic Evaluation of Alternatives

        308. The Requesters allege that the Bank failed to comply with OP 10.04 on
               Economic Evaluation of Investment Operations because it failed "to
               adequately and effectively scrutinize the economic investment and
               environmental risk evaluations of the outfall and alternative sanitation
               solutions."378 The Request claims that the Bank approved an "inadequate"
               economic analysis of alternatives379" while the analysis of options different
               from the outfall were based on "unrealistic" or "suspicious" cost figures
               "that effectively inflated their [other alternatives] costs in comparison to
               those of the chosen outfall system". In the Requesters' view, this happened
               with respect to the use of oxidation lagoons for treatment before dumping
               the waste in the sea, as the prices for the land necessary to implement this
               solution were deemed "prohibitively expensive.380" The Requesters
               complain further that one "ecologically sustainable and economically
               advantageous alternative", the combination of biological treatment lagoons
               and irrigation of mangrove swamps with the treated effluent was not
               considered in the EA381.

        309. The Requesters cite, among others, a report issued by the Comptroller of
               Cartagena, according to which a "reconsideration of alternative solutions to
               the City's sanitation problems, especially those that provide for water
               reuse" was recommended.382              They further refer to the "findings of the
               Outfall Commission appointed in 2000" which "strongly criticized the
               economic and environmental evaluation of alternatives to the submarine
               outfall."383

        310. Management believes that "the comprehensive economic analysis carried
               out during project preparation is in compliance with OP 10.04."384 It also
               states that the analysis of alternatives included in the FS is in "exhaustive
               and sound and is in compliance with OD 4.01" because all alternatives were

              evaluated under an economical standpoint (as well as technical,
              environmental and social) and "...initial investment costs, operation and
              maintenance costs and land uptake" were among the main comparison
              criteria. The Response states that the FS analyzed "six wastewater disposal
              alternatives combining different treatment levels and final disposal sites
              (...) based on cost efficiency (among other criteria, including technical,
              environmental and social criteria." This analysis "concluded that the net
              present value cost of the outfall was about USD 35 million less than the
              next best alternative, land application, and about USD 60 million less than
              lagoons." In relation to the location of the outfall, Management claims that
              that the submarine outfall "was then further analyzed to determine the
              optimum location, based on economic as well as environmental criteria."


2.1. The PAD and the Alternatives

       311. As stated before, OP 10.04: Economic Evaluation of Investment
              Opportunities (September 1994) includes the following provision:
              "Paragraph 3 Alternatives Consideration of alternatives is one of the most
              important features of proper project analysis throughout the project cycle.
              To ensure that the project maximizes expected net present value, subject to
              financial, institutional, and other constraints, the Bank and the borrower
              explore alternative, mutually exclusive, designs. The project design is
              compared with other designs involving differences in such important
              aspects as choice of beneficiaries, types of outputs and services, production
              technology, location, starting date, and sequencing of components. The
              project is also compared with the alternative of not doing it at all."

       312. In relation to the requirement for comparison with a no-project alternative,
              the PAD notes in its Project Rationale section that when assessing the
              options for continuing Bank support for Cartagena's water and sanitation
              sector, "we considered the possibility of terminating the support to the
              sector, considering the fact that the previous Bank project [...]        was
              successful in bringing in a private operator to manage and operate the
              system." However, it was decided that the Bank's participation "would
              reinforce the credibility of the mixed (public and private) capital enterprise
              model, when any form of PSP, especially in the water sector, is still under
              public scrutiny. Furthermore, ACUACAR's negotiations with IFC for the
              latter to finance a part of the investment program were not successful,
              because of ACUACAR's ownership structure, i.e., 50% owned by the public
              sector." 385

       313. The PAD also explains the background to the decision, stating that in light
              of their experience of the mixed success of past water and sanitation
              projects in Colombia in carrying out major institutional reforms alongside

                physical investment programs, "the project team pushed hard for the
                creation of ACUACAR, a mixed capital enterprise, during the latter half of
                the previous Bank project, by leveraging the prospect of additional Bank
                financing for Cartagena's WSS sector under the proposed operation."386

        314. The PAD also says that the alternative of general financing support to
                ACUACAR's investment program, "was rejected since ACUACAR can
                achieve full cost recovery from its investments in rehabilitation and
                extension water supply in affluent neighborhoods and hotel areas." Instead,
                it states that the project's financial support "is targeted to those which full
                cost recovery is hard to achieve, namely, sewerage networks for
                low-income        neighborhoods        surrounding        the   Ciénaga,       wastewater
                conveyance, treatment and disposal systems."387

        315. According to the PAD, a comprehensive set of project alternatives was
                identified and analyzed,388 among which "Discharge of treated effluent to
                the Ciénaga resulted highly expensive, since treatment before such
                discharge should include nutrient removal." It is also said that "Wastewater
                reuse for irrigation is not feasible at the present time in the Cartagena
                region given the lack of suitable areas to receive the entire wastewater
                volumes both during the dry and rainy seasons," while suggesting that the
                project does not exclude future partial reuse initiatives for wastewater and
                that, "the conveyance and submarine outfall systems could well support any
                such initiatives in the future."389 The PAD maintains that, "All alternatives
                were evaluated from technical, economic, environmental and social
                perspectives," and concludes that the comparison of alternatives indicated
                that "disposal of all the wastewater into the Caribbean sea is the most
                feasible option." Furthermore, it is argued that the selected location of the
                outfall at Punta Canoa, although the furthest away from the City of all the
                compared outfall locations, has a steeper sea bottom (requiring a
                comparatively short outfall to reach deep water) and so has "the lowest
                combined cost of on-shore and off-shore pipes."390


2.2. The Feasibility Study

        316. Much of the detailed specification and evaluation of alternatives was done
                in the Feasibility Study (FS).391            The Study's Executive Summary (ES)
                refers to the Sewerage Master Plan, noting that it "was originally prepared

386PAD, p. 12. On p. 13 the PAD suggests that because of political interference and non compliance with
commitments by the public sector, "one of the project conditions specifically requires District authorities
to maintain private sector participation in the provision of the water and sewerage services in Cartagena."

                 by the District of Cartagena and updated by local consultants, regulatory
                 agencies and the World Bank. ACUACAR was responsible for updating the
                 Plan in 1997 and for coordinating the implementation of the works
                 recommended."392               The     Executive       Summary       notes     that   the
                 recommendations of the Sewerage Master Plan in relation to water quality
                 and the disposal of the effluent, were:
                   · The elimination of the discharges of wastewater into (a) Cartagena
                       Bay; and (b) the Tesca Lagoon.
                   · To plan and build a submarine outfall into the Caribbean to dispose of
                       the City's residential liquid waste.
                 And it is stated that Hazen and Sawyer (who prepared the FS) "were
                 selected to review the feasibility of the basic recommendations of the
                 Sewerage Master Plan [...] and outline the works needed to implement the
                 plan." 393

          317. In its section on Selection of Alternatives, the Executive Summary says that
                 three groups of alternatives were developed: "Continue Discharge into
                 Cartagena Bay and Tesca Lagoon;" "Eliminate discharge into the Bay and
                 discharge all the wastewater into Tesca Lagoon;" and" Eliminate
                 discharge     into     the    Bay     and     Lagoon      and    discharge      into  the
                 Caribbean."394Overall, a total of 15 alternatives with different treatment
                 levels were evaluated: "The selection criteria were: water quality,
                 investment costs, resources allocated to the operation and maintenance,
                 and use of land."395

          318. The Executive Summary discusses option sets in which wastewater is to be
                 discharged into Cartagena Bay and/or the Tesca Lagoon, with various levels
                 of treatment. The estimated stage 1 investment costs lie between US $73
                 million and US $206 million, while the present values of the costs lie
                 between US $109 million and US $310 million.396 The ES says that options
                 of treatment and then discharge into both Bay and Lagoon are rejected
                 because "These options do not have an acceptable cost-benefit ratio."

          319. The Executive Summary then examines a set of three options in which
                 treated effluent is discharged only into the Lagoon. These options have
                 estimated stage 1 investment costs that lie between US $49 million and US

396 Discussed further in section 6.6 of the FS. For costs, see Tables on pages RE-6 and RE-7 of the ES
Spanish original. Table 6-14 provides more detail, and summarizes the costs and impacts on water quality
of the alternative combinations of treatment levels and receptors (B1 to B3 and C-1 to C-6).

                 million. Although the option of advanced treatment (BNR) and subsequent
                 discharge only into the Lagoon (option C-6) "produces the best effluent
                 quality", the ES and Section 6.6 of the FS reject it, "due to the high costs"
                 (which are more than double those of option C-4, discussed below),397 and
                 concern is expressed about some continued use of the Lagoon's assimilative
                 capacity.

         320. In option C-4 all the sewage collected in the City will be transported to a
                 stabilization pond system before discharge into the Lagoon. This "could be
                 used in the south zone of the Lagoon, as an extension of the system of
                 ponds."398 The option has estimated stage 1 investment costs of US $74
                 million and a present value of US $94 million.399 According to Section 6.6
                 of the FS, of the three options, "The only potential option is alternative C-
                 4." However, the section then identifies a variety of undesirable impacts
                 that could arise, including continued use of the assimilative capacity of the
                 Tesca Lagoon, water quality deterioration in the rainy season, creation of
                 conditions for algae growth in the lagoon, poorer water quality in adjacent
                 sea beaches, and "other impacts". These impacts include smells from plant
                 operation and a need for slurry management. Also, there will be "The
                 purchase and use of an area of 490 Ha. for treatment works,"400 and it is
                 said that "Currently urban development is taking place in the area
                 designated for the treatment works."401 We return below to the matter of
                 land costs and their potential influence on project costs.

         321. Section 6.6 then says that the alternative of stabilization ponds was rejected.
                 It also says that "In previous projects, adverse impacts were identified,"
                 although it does not specify the projects or the impacts, and that the
                 Wastewater Master Plan recommends "ceasing the discharge of wastewater
                 into the Tesca lagoon in Cartagena Bay." However, since, as noted, the ES
                 says that "Hazen and Sawyer were selected to review the feasibility of the
                 basic recommendations of the Sewerage Master Plan [...]," in this instance
                 appealing to the authority of the Master Plan's recommendations, rather
                 than reviewing them, is inappropriate. Table 2 in The Environmental
                 Assessment Summary in Annex 9 of the PAD402 suggests that
                 "Recommendations of Water & Sewerage Master Plan" formed one of the




397Section 6.6 says this option has Stage 1 capital costs of US $162 million and O & M costs of US $6
million (possibly US $10 million, see table on page 6-25 of the FS in Spanish) and present value of costs
of US $267 million (see Table on page RE-8 of the Spanish original of the ES and Table 6-14 in the FS).
398The ES also suggests that "The effluent could be discharged outside the Lagoon, using the Bocana
project works, into the Caribbean Sea, impacting the neighboring beaches." (ES, p. 6)
399See Table on page RE-8 of the Spanish original of the ES, and Table 6-14 in the FS.
400However, the ES, p. 8, says that "The system of ponds would occupy appropriately 390 hectares," so
there is a discrepancy.

                two environmental criteria that were used to evaluate the final site for the
                outfall, (i.e. ocean, Cartagena Bay, or Tesca Lagoon).403

        322. Section 6.6 goes on to say "If it is proposed that the discharge of the
                treated effluent of the secondary treatment works, both on an intermediate
                or long term basis, this would bring about an important change of policy in
                the City of Cartagena." There is no discussion there of whether the current
                policy was of long standing or had itself reflected relatively recent changes
                in thinking.

        323. The ES says that the use of the Lagoon to assimilate waste "would be
                contrary to the objective of restoring water quality and the ecology of the
                Tesca Lagoon. The results of the surveys of independent investigators, made
                by World Bank consultants, indicate that the residents of Cartagena value
                the resource of the Lagoon and favor its restoration. The construction of the
                stabilization ponds could compromise, in the long term, the assimilation
                capacity of the Lagoon. This option was rejected for being inconsistent with
                the long term goal of restoring the Tesca Lagoon."404

        324. Thus from the Executive Summary and Section 6.6 of the FS, it seems that
                the stabilization ponds and discharge into the Lagoon were rejected
                principally on environmental and related grounds. This suggests that in this
                instance these environmental criteria dominated the decision-making
                process. In contrast, as noted earlier, the advanced treatment (BNR)
                alternative (C-6), was rejected "due to the high costs," suggesting that for
                that option the value of the economic cost criterion dominated, although the
                ES also implies that the option is rejected due "to the continued use of the
                limited assimilation capacity of the Lagoon."

        325. The third option set discussed in the Executive Summary of the FS concerns
                disposal into the Caribbean Sea: "Several submarine outfall alternatives
                were evaluated with the discharge of different levels of treated effluent. The
                level of treatment of the effluent varied between preliminary and secondary
                treatment, conventional and non conventional."405 The estimated present
                values of the costs of the submarine outfall alternatives ranged between US
                $62 million and US $250 million, with the lowest cost alternative being the
                2.9 km outfall discharging at 20 meter depth at Punta Canoas.406

        326. The ES explains that four alternative conveyance pipe and outfall routes
                were evaluated (Ciénaga de Tesca, La Boquilla, Punta Canoa and Isla de
                Tierra Bomba). The last of these was discarded because of potential


403The other criterion involved water quality restrictions in the receiving water body.

                permanent impacts on coral ecosystems from the outfall's construction,407
                leaving the remainder as viable, feasible outfall routes. Each alternative
                "offers different possible routes on land to link up with the starting point of
                the respective outfall. The selection of the best combination of possible
                routes was developed [based on] a system of priority analysis [...]. Based
                on the priority analysis established, we recommend Alternative 3-2 as the
                land route and the outfall in Punta Canoa as the baseline project."408
                Section 6.10 of the FS comments that this option (MC-1) "is 40% less in
                cost than any other technical solution and it provides the immediate means
                to improve the water quality in Cartagena Bay and Ciénaga de Tesca."

        327. Section 11 (Cost analysis and ranking of alternatives for the outfall) of the
                FS says that alternative 3-2 had the lowest estimated present value of total
                costs, and further explains the priority analysis. The costs of the alternatives
                were used, along with the three other criteria, to achieve an overall ranking
                of alternatives. These non-economic criteria (discussed in Ch. 10409) were:
                Technical/physical (with three sub-factors: construction capacity; crossings;
                and access); environmental (with sub-factors: impacts on wetlands due to
                pipeline construction; water fluctuations; and areas of special interest); and
                socio-political (with sub-factors: adjacent houses; traffic disturbance; and
                public acceptance ­ and it may be observed that Section 10.3.3 says that the
                `adjacent houses' and public acceptance factors are "almost insignificant"
                because of "the rural aspect of this project."). Section 11.6 says that the
                non-economic criteria "are allocated as criteria values for each alternative
                on a subjective basis," while the economic factors related with the
                construction costs "will receive a ranking on the basis of the relative
                magnitude of their cost. The preferred route will be the alternative with the
                lowest results, on the basis of the total factors, both economic and non
                economic."


        328. For each alternative, the level for each criterion was developed and assigned
                (and aggregate values are shown in Table 11-24 (Ranking of Alternatives)).
                Section 11.6 comments: "The Punta Canoa outfall alternatives had the
                most positive results. [...] A more detailed participation by the regulatory
                agencies and ACUACAR personnel in the selection of a land corridor could
                alter the ranking. [...] Based on the classification method employed,
                alternative 3-2 is recommended for the basic project." In the ranking, in
                which fewer points means a higher score, scores for the Punta Canoa
                alternatives ranged between 16.5 and 20 points, while the scores for the
                other two ranged between 22 and 30.5. Table 11-23, from which Table 24 is
                derived, contains several columns giving values to each alternative
                according to several criteria grouped in the following categories: (1) Non

                 and (2) Economic (simply the present value). The grand totals for each
                 alternative are the result of equally weighing the values for each of the four
                 factors.


2.3. The Effects of Alternative Land Cost Estimates

         329. In discussing Alternatives C-3 and C-4, the feasibility study acknowledges
                 uncertainty about land costs, when it notes that: "La incertitude mayor en el
                 costo es la obtención de 300 ó 490 Ha de terrenos para las Alternativos C-3
                 y C-4. Se estimaron los costos del terreno en $3/m2. Sin embargo, se han
                 citado valores de la tierra tan altos como $5/m2. El sitio es un área
                 residencial potencial para la Ciudad en vias de expansion."410 However, it
                 does not discuss the source or the reliability of the land cost estimates. The
                 Panel finds that, having acknowledged uncertainty about land prices,
                 the analysis in the feasibility study did not then provide a clear
                 justification for the prices used in the costing of the project
                 alternatives.

         330. Various tables in the FS estimate the cost of land at values ranging from
                 US$20,000 to $50,000 per hectare.             411  Some tables include a 16% IVA
                 (VAT) tax in the land price, while others record it as a separate charge,
                 although a consistent treatment would have made them more simply
                 comparable. In the tables for some options there are also charges for rights
                 of way. During the investigation the Panel received two letters signed by
                 local real estate corporations, in which they estimated the price of the land
                 in basically the same area at values ranging between Col$5 million and
                 Col.$15 million per hectare in September 2001.412 These figures convert to
                 values of about US$2746 per hectare and US$8237 per hectare at the time
                 of the FS.413

         331. Both estimates are greatly exceeded by the lowest value in the cost range
                 used in the feasibility study, and if accurate would affect the cost estimates
                 of the alternatives in the relevant feasibility study tables. Consequently the

49; Table 6.23, p. 6-52; Table 6.24, p. 6-56; Table 6.25, p. 6-60. The latter table's footnote 6 states that the
price of land varies between US$2 and US$5/m² depending on its location. The option of leasing the land is
estimated at US$2/m on the basis of a 5% interest rate. The footnote adds that for future development of
treatment facilities this lease price estimation may not be appropriate.
412These letters are dated September 6 and 7, 2001, and were issued respectively by "Lonja de Propiedad
Raiz de Cartagena, and the "Corporación Lonja Inmobiliaria de Cartagena." They calculate the price per
hectare between Col.$ 5,000,000 to Col.$ 15,000,000.
413The figures were converted to Colombian peso prices of July 1998, by `deflating' by the Cartagena
inflation rate, and then to US dollars by using the peso-dollar exchange rate of July 1998.

                Panel reworked the costs of the alternatives that appeared in Table 6-28 of
                the feasibility study, to take into account the suggested upper and lower
                values.414 The results are shown in the revised Table 6-28 and in the Figure
                below.

         332. On the basis of these revisions to Table 6-28, the Panel observes that the
                gap between the three lowest cost options narrows significantly. In
                particular, the gap between the chosen option (MC-1: preliminary treatment
                with the submarine outfall) and option MC-5 (land application with the
                outfall) falls from US$35 million to US$23-27 million, i.e. by almost one
                third to one seventh to of its original size. Also the gap between the chosen
                option and option C-4 (stabilization ponds and discharge to the Lagoon)
                falls by one half to almost one third of its original size, i.e. from US$32
                million to US$16-20 million.




414The Panel found some errors in the original tables in chapter 6, although fortunately they do not
materially affect the outcomes.

2.4. The Environmental License Requirement for Primary Treatment after 10 years

         333. The Panel also notes that after the Board approved the Project, the
               environmental license for the submarine outfall issued in 2001 by
               CARDIQUE, the regional environmental authority, required the installation
               after ten years of primary treatment of the wastes at the preliminary
               treatment plant at Punta Canoa. This requirement for primary treatment
               significantly raises both the costs of investment and of operation and
               maintenance of the submarine outfall option, according to the figures given
               in the feasibility study. The Management Response confirms that "...the
               District will be responsible for upgrading the plant to primary treatment."415
               However, the Response does not appear to place a value on these costs ­
               nor is it said that this was done after the issue of the license in 2001.

         334. When the estimates from the feasibility study are reworked to allow for the
               upgrading to primary treatment, they suggest the following: compared with
               what they would otherwise have been, investment costs after 10 years could
               rise by between about US $24 and $32 million, while the present value of
               total costs (including operation and maintenance), could increase by
               between about US $30 to $34 million, thus raising total costs for the project
               from the original present value of about US$ 62 million to US $93 to $96
               million (or about $3 million less, using the alternative land prices).416 These
               values are close to those of options MC-5 (Land Application ­ submarine
               outfall) and C-4 (Stabilization lagoons ­ discharge to the Ciénaga) given in
               Table 6-28 of the feasibility study.

         335. OP 10.04 provides that the "[c]onsideration of alternatives is one of the
               most important features of proper analysis throughout the project cycle."
               The Panel finds that when the environmental license was issued for the
               submarine outfall requiring primary treatment in ten years, the Bank
               should have recalculated the costs of the alternative and reviewed the
               economic analysis in light of this new licensing requirement, to be
               consistent with OP 10.04.

2.5. The Composition of the Panel of Experts

         336. As noted earlier in this report, the Bank appointed an international Panel of
               Experts in the field of marine outfall technology to review and advise on the
               ongoing work in the feasibility study on alternatives in. This offered a
               potentially valuable additional avenue of scrutiny. However, in the Panel's
               view, given the longstanding controversy concerning the preferred


415 Management Response, ¶ 38, p. 18.
416 The lower bound on the new present values of total costs assumes that there would be some economies
in the investment costs of establishing the primary treatment after ten years, compared with the two-stage
process suggested for MC-2 in Table 6-23 of the feasibility study..


                                                    115

               option to address the City's wastewater problems, it would have been
               appropriate to have had the Panel of Experts include a wider range of
               expertise, to provide more authoritative findings about both the
               socioeconomic impacts and the economic costs of the alternatives
               considered.

3. Poverty Reduction

       337. The Requesters allege that the Bank failed to comply with OD 4.15 on
               Poverty Reduction.417 They claim that the Project's "deficient alternatives
               analysis and risk assessment fail to account for potential negative impacts
               on the poor both within and outside the district that will be served by the
               outfall." They also argue that "it is very unlikely that the submarine outfall
               project is the kind of "sustainable, high return project" that OD 4.15
               indicates the Bank will support." 418

       338. Two of the Bank policies raised by the Requesters in the claim address
               poverty reduction as the greater goal of World Bank-financed Projects: OP
               10.04, Economic Evaluation of Investment Opportunities and OD 4.15,
               Poverty Reduction. OP 10.04 states that "The economic analysis examines
               the project's consistency with the Bank's poverty reduction strategy. [see
               OD 4.15, Poverty Reduction] If the project is to be included in the Program
               of targeted Interventions, the analysis considers mechanisms for targeting
               the poor."419

       339. OD 4.15 Poverty Reduction summarizes Bank procedures and guidelines
               for operational work on poverty reduction. It states that: "Sustainable
               poverty reduction is the Bank's overarching objective. The Directive also
               includes the following:

         "27. (...) Country circumstances, as analyzed in the CAS, will determine when
         individual Bank-supported investment operations should focus more specifically
         on poverty reduction. Such operations aim to (a) raise the productivity of the
         poor's physical assets and increase their incomes, through the provision of
         infra-structure, credit, technology, and complementary inputs and by
         regularizing de facto land tenure rights; (b) develop human capital by
         improving access to (and the quality of) basic health, nutrition, family planning,
         and education services; (c) improve living conditions by providing basic
         infrastructure and social services; and/or (d) provide a safety net."

         "28. Role of the Bank. The Bank's role in supporting poverty reduction through
         individual investment operations goes beyond financing. The Bank supports

Program of Targeted Interventions.

        sustainable, high return projects and project components that benefit the poor
        and that would not be done, or would be done differently, without the Bank."

        "30. Risk Analysis. The economic analysis considers project risks, including
        risks to institutional, political, and financial sustainability that will jeopardize
        project benefits if project assumptions are not met. Since poor people live at the
        margin of existence, downside risks are life threatening. Therefore, risk analysis
        is essential for poverty-reducing projects (...). These projects may also have
        important side effects for environmental and demographic outcomes, which
        should be carefully analyzed."

       340. As noted earlier, Management responds in relation to OP 10.04, that
            Management takes the view that the comprehensive economic analysis
            carried out during project preparation is in compliance with OP 10.04."420

       341. In relation to OD 4.15 "Management takes the view that the project is in
            compliance with OD 4.15 on poverty" because all studies and reviews
            conducted with respect to this Project determined that the outfall will pose a
            "minimal" risk of environmental damage. Management adds that "There is
            no evidence that the outfall will interrupt the economic activity of fishermen
            from Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo. Moreover, the three
            villages will benefit and economic activities in the larger also should benefit
            from the project for the following reasons: (i) the new wastewater disposal
            system will reduce contamination of Cartagena's beaches, Cartagena Bay
            and the Ciénaga de la Virgen; (ii) the project will provide water and most
            probably sanitation services to the three villages;[...] (iii) the project
            provides support for community development and organization; and (iv) the
            improvement in the environment due to better wastewater disposal will help
            bolster tourism in the area, creating jobs and economic opportunities. Both
            the technical design of the project and the monitoring program will ensure
            that fishing and tourism in the North Zone will not be impacted. [...]"421

       342. Management claims that the outfall project will benefit a large part of the
            poor communities of Cartagena and will cause "negligible negative
            impacts."    422 It also emphasizes that "the project aims to bring public
            health benefits in terms of sanitation services especially to the city's poor
            and marginal areas." Thus, in Management's view, the Project has to be
            considered in terms of benefiting the entire Cartagena area, "rather than
            solely the three communities referenced in the Request."423 Among these
            benefits,    Management        lists the "expansion of services to poor
            neighborhoods" which will reduce the families' expenses for water. The
            Response reports that "Monthly water expenses of the poor population not

                 connected to the public water network are 10 to 50 times higher than those
                 of the connected population."              424  In addition, once the sewerage system
                 improves the standard of living of the poor neighborhoods "upgrading of
                 other neighborhood infrastructure is anticipated".425

         343. However, Management claims, "These benefits will not come at the cost of
                 poverty reduction and environmental impacts in the three villages near the
                 outfall site as stated in the Request. To the contrary, based on analytical
                 work prepared for the project, Management concludes that the risk of
                 environmental damage to the three villages is minimal and the project
                 contains targeted interventions that will clearly benefit these groups."426

3.1. The PAD's Poverty Impact Analysis

         344. The PAD emphasizes poverty reduction as an objective when it states that
                 the first of the project's development objectives is to "(i) improve the water
                 and sewerage services of Cartagena and the sanitary conditions of the city's
                 poorest population, by expanding water and sewerage coverage,
                 particularly in the city's poor neighborhoods [...]."427 The PAD's section
                 C3 discusses the Benefits to the target population, beginning with the
                 statement that "The project is expected to bring public health benefits in
                 terms of sanitation services especially in the city's poor and marginal
                 areas."428 The section goes on to supply more detail of which of the City's
                 poorest neighborhoods is expected to benefit from the project. In view of
                 the Project's design and the locations that will be affected, there seems
                 little doubt that substantial numbers of poor people in the city of
                 Cartagena are intended to and seem likely to experience significant
                 benefits associated with the provision of enhanced access to and quality
                 of water and sewerage services.

         345. In relation specifically to the economic analysis, OP 10.04 requires, as
                 noted, that it "examines the project's consistency with the Bank's poverty
                 reduction strategy."               The Summary Project Analysis in Section E.1
                 (Economic) of the PAD makes relatively little reference to poverty
                 reduction.429 However, as noted earlier, Section VII of Annex 4, Poverty
                 Impact, contains a brief analysis - treated in a table (Table 6) and eight lines
                 of text. - that "measures how much of the consumer benefits accrue to
                 poorer consumers." The PAD observes, however, that the income data

429Although it mentions the value of benefits that might occur in two very poor neighborhoods, in which
the internal rate of return just fails to meet the cut-off rate of 12 per cent.


                                                        118

                collected during the WTP surveys430 made it "impossible to calculate with
                any accuracy the impact of the project on the poor."

          346. In the absence of appropriate income data, the PAD says, "Assuming that
                (i) poor consumers are defined as customers that fit into the first three
                strata of the tariff structure; and (ii) that most rich households will already
                been connected to the water supply system, and hence new customers will
                mainly be poorer households. On the basis of these assumptions, poor
                consumers will receive most of the benefits of the project as can be seen in
                Table 6."431         Table 6 of the PAD is reproduced below (with some
                amendments in the third column).

               Note *: the negative impact is mainly due to shadow pricing the financial benefits in order to obtain

          347. The footnote to Table 6 says that the negative impact (presumably the loss
                to the poor associated with the water supply projects) "is mainly due to
                shadow pricing the financial benefits in order to obtain the economic
                benefits." In the Panel's view a fuller explanation should have been
                supplied, since it is not obvious, for example, how in the Expansion El
                Pozón subproject the difference of ­$147 thousand between the economic
                and the financial          benefits shown in Table 4 and Table 1 (Col.$2656
                thousand minus Col.$2803 thousand), multiplies more than seven times to
                reach its level of ­Col.$1107 thousand in Table 5, which appears to make
                up most of the Col.$1201 thousand negative benefit to the poor shown in
                the second column of Table 6.

          348. The evidence on poverty impact analysis in the PAD is limited to the
                highly aggregated `poor'/'non-poor' columns of Table 6 in Annex 4 and


430 As noted, they did not, in any case, cover WTP for "improved water supplies and expansion of water
supplied in the poorest neighborhoods" (PAD, p. 56), while for the sewage collection WTP surveys, "The
three sub-basins where the survey was not performed were included in the program after the execution of
the field work." (SI Cost-Benefit study, English translation, Part II, footnote 13, p. 14.).

               eight lines of text. In the Panel's view, this is an issue of great
               importance to the Project.              Given that the first of the Project
               development objectives is to improve water and sewerage services and
               sanitary conditions of the city's poorest population, and where ­ as
               with many projects that may benefit poor people ­ it is possible that
               some of the poor may gain while others lose, it is disturbing that more
               effort was not put in during the Project preparation and appraisal to
               enable sufficient income and/or other data to be assembled to assess the
               Project's impacts on the poor "with any accuracy."

        349. It might have been possible, for example, to augment the analysis by
               introducing other related evidence, such as that in the social
               assessment, which the PAD (p. 20) states, "proved that the project will
               benefit the poorest communities in Cartagena which currently lack
               sanitary services." Indeed, the Panel notes that Management may well
               have missed an opportunity to demonstrate clearly the extent to which
               the project design might be consistent with the Bank's poverty
               reduction strategy, as OP 10.04 requires.

3.2. Effects on the Three Communities Referenced in the Request

        350. As noted earlier, Management maintains that no evidence supports the
               claim that the outfall will be detrimental to the economic activity of
               fishermen from Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra and Manzanillo and that
               "fishing activity, to the extent that it might occur in these areas would not
               be adversely affected."         433   Moreover, the environmental monitoring
               program and additional technical measures "will continue to ensure that
               fishing and tourism will not be impacted."        434However, the evidence to
               which the Response refers is principally scientific and environmental
               evidence. While it is clearly essential to exercise due diligence in a
               scientific analysis of the probable impacts of the outfall, there are also
               issues of perceptions and public acceptability which can have real impacts
               on project outcomes, even if some regard them as mis-perceptions of an
               underlying reality. The importance of such issues is            acknowledged
               elsewhere in the appraisal process ­ for example, in discussing Possible
               Controversial Aspects, the PAD states that the use of a submarine outfall
               "may cause some controversy due to lack of understanding of the
               technology,"435 and in the Feasibility Study `public acceptability' was used
               as a criterion in examining the impacts of construction routes.436

        351. Thus if the outfall were perceived by the public at large, including tourists,
               to be polluting, and if the evidence to the contrary were not trusted, then

            there would be a potential for real damage to the markets for local fish and
            perhaps also for the products of the shrimp farms/hatcheries, which might
            impact significantly on livelihoods end employment opportunities in Punta
            Canoa. There would also be the potential for significant damage to earnings
            from recreational beach activity and fish sales, for example in Manzanillo.
            The PAD says that: "[...] restrictions on fishing, widely disseminated
            throughout local communities, in the mix zone of the discharge will have to
            be closely monitored during outfall operation."437       These restrictions,
            although clearly designed to ensure safer fishing and to allay fears of
            contamination, might also through this wide dissemination become
            associated with public suspicion of fishing and other activities in the
            vicinity of   the outfall and even at some distance from it. While the
            Management response points appropriately to the environmental monitoring
            program and the "availability of technical mitigatory measures if needed
            (chlorination and/or future waste stream treatment beyond preliminary
            treatment)," such measures alone might be seen by the fishing communities
            as being reactive and insufficient to address the harm they might suffer
            before the mitigating measures were both put into effect and widely
            accepted by the wider community of residents and tourists as being
            effective. Moreover, chlorination might pose its own risks.

       352. There are, therefore, risks to these poor communities which have not
            been properly and explicitly addressed in the appraisal of the Project.
            Had this been done, it might then have been possible both to reassure
            the concerned communities about the levels of risk and/or to put in
            place fall-back mechanisms that would provide trustworthy and timely
            "insurance" or compensation were the events to arise. In the Panel's
            view, therefore, in relation to risk the Bank has not complied with OD
            4.15. Compliance would have meant giving greater and earlier
            attention to the risks to and concerns of these communities, whose
            willingness to accept the location and consequences of the outfall was
            key to the successful delivery of the potentially very substantial benefits
            intended for so many of Cartagena's other poor citizens.

       353. The Management Response's discussion includes a section. Sharing in
            Project Benefits. Here, the Response accepts that the promised piped water
            services to the North Zone villages of Punta Canoa, Manzanillo and Arroyo
            de Piedra, which were to have been completed bythe end of 2003, as set out
            in the Loan agreement, had not been completed. This was because of fiscal
            restrictions on the Municipality - and because investments for the
            communities' water systems were not protected by the financial structure
            that had earmarked counterpart funds for loan execution and passed them to
            trust funds. That the provision of water supply to the three communities
            appears to have been added at the final stages of the project, and in a way
            that did not ensure their protection, raises questions about whether the

                                          121

               interests of the villages were fully taken account in the project
               appraisal/feasibility stages.

        354. The Response says that the project will provide water "and most probably
               sanitation services to the three villages." It is explained in a footnote that
               "While water services to the North Zone were a condition in the project
               Legal Agreements, sanitation services were not due to lack of financing.
               [...] It is the intention of the project counterparts to use these additional
               project funds to extend sewerage services to the North Zone."438 The body
               text confirms that "Should additional funds exist from project savings,
               sanitation services through a sewerage network will be provided to the
               same communities." However, the provision of the promised water services
               has been delayed,439 while the provision of these sewerage services appears
               to be of uncertain timing and extent. Paragraph 47 in the Management
               response lays out - with greater clarity than in the PAD - some of the ways
               in which the North Zone communities are likely to benefit significantly
               from provisions now associated with the project. Nevertheless, when the
               Panel visited Manzanillo and Punta Canoa, the inhabitants seemed unclear
               about the nature, timing, extent and costs of future water and/or sewerage
               provision, and of some of the other benefits that may flow from the project.
               440


        355. Management rightly draws attention to the very considerable benefits that
               could flow to much larger poor communities than those in the North Zone.
               Nevertheless, in the Panel's view compliance with OD 4.15 would have
               meant giving greater and earlier attention to the risks to and concerns
               of those communities, whose willingness to accept the location and
               consequences of the outfall was key to the successful delivery of the
               potentially very substantial benefits intended for so many of
               Cartagena's other poor citizens.

3.3. Potential Impacts on Other Poverty-Reducing Investments by the District

        356. A further issue that was drawn to the Panel's attention during its visit to
               Cartagena concerned the extent to which the Municipality's financial
               commitments to this project had led or might in the future lead to difficult
               or inappropriate trade-offs between investment in water and sewerage
               services and expenditures in other potentially poverty-reducing areas, such
               as the ongoing provision of health or transport infrastructure and services.
               The financial evaluation in this report describes the effectiveness of the
               measures designed to ensure a sustained, secure flow of funds from the
               District. These measures are also described in section 15 of Annex 1 of the
               Management Response, which states that "The District was also required

439Although the Response (¶ 47, p. 20) says that works to provide water services "are about to begin."

              to: (i) obtain an operational surplus in order to reduce its unpaid debt [...]
              and (ii) keep other infrastructure investments to a minimum." This meant
              prioritizing water and sewerage investments over other investments. Such a
              decision might or might not have been the most appropriate strategy for
              poverty reduction - but the issue merited analysis or discussion because of
              the potentially foregone opportunities441 involved. Yet there appears to be
              little or no analysis or examination of this in the PAD, nor an attempt to set
              this project in the wider context of poverty reduction challenges and
              opportunities in the City.

       357.     The Management Response states that "the project is consistent with the
              approach laid out in the World Bank Environment Strategy for Latin
              America and the Caribbean [...], which prioritizes access to safe water and
              improving collection and disposal of wastewater." Nevertheless, as OD
              4.15 makes clear, the Environmental Strategy for Latin America and the
              Caribbean is only one element in the strategies that can contribute to
              poverty reduction. In the Panel's view, the decision to focus on water
              and sewerage investments was not inappropriate, but given the
              Project's potential consequences in keeping alternative infrastructure
              investments "to a minimum", the potential impact on other poverty
              reducing investments should have been properly addressed. This might
              have given confidence that the project was the best use of the scarce
              financial resources of the District, and thus have showed compliance
              with OD 4.15.

CHAPTER FIVE: FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE AND
              SUPERVISION




                  124

1. Financial Management Assessment and Financial Management Capacity of the
District of Cartagena

        358. The Request for Inspection claims that "the Bank has violated the financial
               management standards of OP 10.02 by accepting inaccurate financial and
               accounting statements from the borrower.442" According to the Requesters,
               during the Project's preparation and appraisal phases (1999 and 2000) the
               Mayoral Office of Internal Control of Cartagena "issued reports"443
               revealing the "unreliability of the City's accounting system" which,
               according to these reports, did not provide an accurate assessment of the
               City's economic situation."444 The Request reports also about investigations
               and corruption charges moved to three successive mayors of Cartagena
               during the 1990s. In the Requesters' view, it is unclear whether "the Bank
               appropriately considered these and other uncertainties about Cartagena's
               capacity either to responsibly manage public funds and partnerships with
               private companies like AGBAR or to take on the large loan and long-term
               capital commitment associated with the outfall project."445

        359. Management responds that "the project is in compliance with the financial
               management covenants in the Loan and Project Agreements.446" because
               "[i]n accordance with OP 10.02, the Bank has required audited financial
               statements for both ACUACAR and the project to be submitted to the Bank
               on an annual basis (see Article IV, Section 4.01 of the Project Agreement),
               and ACUACAR has maintained financial management systems to assure
               accurate and timely information regarding project resources and
               expenditures."447In addition, based on the Loan Agreement, the District
               must ensure "that the required audits supporting loan withdrawals made
               under Project Management Reports (PMRs) are carried out in keeping with
               standards acceptable to the Bank." The Response adds that independent
               auditors have submitted "consistently unqualified annual audits448"
               regarding the financial statements of ACUACAR and the Project accounts.
               ACUACAR has also submitted quarterly PMRs, which require detailed and
               comprehensive information on financial, physical, and procurement
               processes. The Bank reviewed them and found ACUACAR's record in
               preparing them to be excellent.

       360. Management also claims that the Bank carried out a work "in line with good
               practice on financial analysis" in Project preparation and supervision,
               including work on the financial assessment of the District and ACUACAR,
               the financial structure of the operation and the financial performance of
               ACUACAR and the District as well as financial management of the Project.
               According to Management, during Project preparation the Bank reviewed
               the District capacity to manage public funds and concluded that it had
               "appropriate capacity".449

       361. The Bank policy on Financial Management ­ OP 10.02 ­ requires the
               Borrower and the Project implementing agency to maintain adequate
               financial management systems so as to provide accurate and timely
               information to the Bank with respect to Project resources and expenditures.
               450  The financial management system includes accounting, financial
               reporting and auditing systems. As provided in the policy, since the
               beginning of Project implementation the Borrower and the implementing
               agency "must have in place accounting and internal control systems that
               [...] (a) reliably record all assets and liabilities and financial transactions
               of the project [...] and (b) provide sufficient financial information for
               managing and monitoring project activities."451 In addition, the borrower
               and the executing agency are required to submit to the Bank "annual
               audited financial statements of the project that are acceptable to the
               Bank452" and to have these financial statements audited each year in
               accordance with standards acceptable to the Bank453.

       362. The Bank Procedure (BP) 10.02 requires that during Project preparation,
               Bank Regional staff inform the borrower and the Project implementing
               agency about the Bank requirements for financial management systems, and
               make sure that an adequate financial management system is in place.
               Regional staff also assess the adequacy of the accounting and auditing
               practices, of standards, and internal and other controls systems. According
               to the procedure, Regional staff further agree with the borrower and the
               Project implementing agency on remedial actions and on a timetable if the
               financial management system needs improvement.

       363. In response to the Requesters' complaints this Report reviews the adequacy
               of the analyses made by the Bank in (a) assessing the financial management
               capacity of the District and of ACUACAR, and (b) evaluating their
               financial capacity to provide the financial resources to implement the
               Project and repay the Bank loan in accordance with the agreements reached

                 among the Bank, the District, and ACUACAR. This Report addresses these
                 issues following the sequence of phases of a project cycle, in particular
                 Project preparation, appraisal and implementation/supervision.

1.1. Financial Management Assessment

         364. Project preparation and appraisal. The Panel observes that the Project
                 records examined show that the Bank's main financial concern with the
                 District of Cartagena was to ensure that the District contributed the agreed
                 amount of Project funding (US$7.58 million equivalent) and that it had the
                 capacity to repay the Bank loan (including interest). To avoid getting deeply
                 involved in District management and financial matters,454 the Bank ensured
                 that the District would earmark and pledge a percentage of its tax receipts to
                 fund its share of the Project (the equivalent of about US$7.58 million) and
                 to repay the Bank loan (US$85 million).           455  Financial projections prepared
                 by the District and reviewed by the Bank at Project appraisal showed that
                 these tax receipts would be sufficient to cover the District's financial
                 obligations to the Project.

         365. The Panel notes that the Project records reveal that the Bank was aware of
                 the District's internal control and financial management problems noted by
                 the Report. For the past five years the Contralor Distrital's audit opinion on
                 the District's accounts has stated that "these do not reasonably represent the
                 fair account balances" and that because of this fact and other financial
                 internal control problems the Contralor Distrital "cannot provide an opinion
                 on the fairness of the District's financial statements."456 This is important
                 because of the three tax revenues that the District had pledged to the
                 Project, the Impuesto Predial Unificado (IPU-Unified Property Tax) is the
                 only one the District itself bills and collects; the national Government
                 channels the other two to the District's bank accounts. Hence, if the District
                 had serious internal management and financial deficiencies in billing and
                 collecting the IPU, this could have a negative effect on Project financing
                 and loan repayments.

         366. The appraisal assumptions for the IPU tax were that the District would
                 improve its tax collection rate from 44% in 1998 to 51% by 2002 and that,
                 as a result of reassessments, the tax base would increase in 2002 by 15%, in
                 real terms. The PAD's financial projections for 18% of IPU receipts show
                 an increase from US$3.5 million in 1998 to US$5 million in 2002


454Panel Interviews.
455The Bank agreed to the District's pledge to earma rk the following funds for the Project: 18% of the
District's receipts of the Impuesto Predial Unificado (IPU); 10% of its receipts of the oil tax Aportes de
Regalias (ARs); 20% 455 of its receipts of Aportes por ICN/Sistema General de Participaciones (AICN); and
annual payments of US$2.2 million that the District will receive from ACUACAR from January 2005
through December 2011, as ACUACAR's contribution to the Project.

                (remaining constant at US$5 million for 2003 and 2004).457 Actual
                collection rates were 42% and 41% in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and the
                actual revenue collected in those years was US$3.1 million and US$2.8
                million. The Panel was informed that the District did indeed increase
                property assessments in line with the financial projections and assumptions
                made in the PAD. However, there is still a large shortfall in actual IPU
                revenues compared to appraisal estimates. This shortfall can be explained
                partly by the difficult economic conditions in Cartagena, where about 80%
                of the population has a medium or low income, and partly by an alleged
                lack of pay culture. However, many audit reports, including those of the
                Contralor Distrital, point to another important factor: the District's inability
                to properly bill and collect property taxes. The Panel was informed that the
                property registers are so outdated that many properties have yet to be
                registered and assessed correctly.

         367. Fortunately for both the District and the Project, the actual revenues from
                the ARs were US$0.43 million and US$0.80 million in 2002 and 2003,
                respectively, substantially higher than PAD projections of US$0.27 million
                for each of those years. The AICN was also higher in 2002 (US$4.6 million
                compared to the PAD estimate of US$ 3.8 million) but lower in 2003
                (US$3.3 million compared to a projection of US$ 3.8 million). It should be
                noted that this analysis is based on US dollar terms--and the US dollar has
                been declining in value against most major currencies as well as in relation
                to the Colombian peso, and is expected to continue doing so according to
                the Ministry of Finance and projections by The Economist .458                        If the
                dollar's future appreciation vis-à-vis the Colombian peso keeps pace with
                Colombian inflation, and if there is no growth in the Colombian
                economy,459 it is projected that, in dollar terms, the District will have
                sufficient accumulated revenues from pledged and earmarked taxes to repay
                the Bank loan. Furthermore, according to information provided to the Panel
                by Bank Management on June 21, 2005, the District has been collecting
                increased revenues, in current Colombian peso terms, from each of the
                pledged and earmarked taxes.         460


         368. The Panel notes that, because the District would not be in charge of Project
                implementation, the Bank decided it would not need to carry out a financial




457In Current Col.$ the PAD projected that 18% of IPU receipts for 2002 and 2003 would amount to
Col.$ 11,969 million and Col.$ 13,166 million, respectively. Actual receipts were Col.$ 7,638 million and
Col.$ 7,835 million for 2002 and 2003, respectively.
458The US dollar reached a peak exchange rate value in March 2003 vis -à-vis the Colombian peso of about
Col. $ 2, 957 per US$1. The November 17, 2004, rate was Col.$ 2,523 per US$1, while the June 21, 2005
exchange rate was Col.$2,321 per US$1. (Source World Bank)
459These are very conservative assumptions.
460It should be noted that in the future these revenue increases may not fully compensate for the reduced
IPU tax revenues noted above.

                 management assessment for the District.461                  Given the assumptions
                 reflected in the PAD--that about 55% of the funds to be made available by
                 the District would come from IPU revenues-- the Panel finds that the
                 Bank should have paid more attention to the District's internal control
                 and management problems and should have carried out an in-depth
                 financial management assessment of the District. The Bank should have
                 worked with the District on an action plan to improve the District's
                 property tax registers and its billing and collection systems. Failure to
                 do this shows a certain degree of financial management shortsightedness on
                 the Bank's side.

         369. Furthermore, since the Bank was aware of the District's internal control
                 and management problems, it should have required that the District, as
                 the borrower of the Bank loan, have its accounts and financial
                 statements audited by independent auditors each year and provide a
                 copy of the audit report to the Bank. The independent auditors would
                 have highlighted these problems in their report, and the Bank could have
                 addressed any emerging problems early on during Project supervision,
                 including seeking actions by the District and obtaining the support of the
                 Ministry of Finance to find a satisfactory solution to this problem.

         370. The District's obligations under the Project are channeled directly into a
                 trust fund that is managed by an independent financial administrator (La
                 Previsora), and withdrawals from this account are made exclusively to fund
                 the Project and to repay the Bank loan. However, the Bank did not require
                 that the trust fund account be audited each year by independent auditors (as
                 it requires for all other Project accounts, such as the special account). In
                 fact, the trust fund account is to remain open until the Bank loan is fully
                 repaid by the District. The Panel notes that the Bank did not pay
                 sufficient attention to the design of the financial management
                 information requirements for the Project. Moreover, although paragraph
                 14 of section 6 of the Fiduciary Trust Fund Agreement between the District
                 and La Previsora allows the Ministry of Finance to carry out audits of this
                 trust fund, the Agreement does not specifically require that such audits be
                 performed each year by independent auditors. La Previsora, however, does
                 have its accounts audited by independent auditors (KPMG), who perform
                 yearly audits on each individual trust fund account La Previsora manages,
                 including the one related to Loan 4507-CO. The audit report for the year
                 ending December 31, 2003, provides an "unqualified opinion" on the



461Financial management assessment (which is distinct from financial analysis work, which deals mainly
with financial statements and forecasts of revenues and expenses) reviews accounting policies and
procedures and information systems, budgeting controls, and more generally the internal controls of the
institution. The Bank guidelines for "Reviews of Financial Management and Accounting Systems" that
were applicable at the time of Project preparation and appraisal are provided in Annex V of the Financial,
Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH) of January 1995.

              Project's Trust Fund Financial Statements No evidence was found on
              file that the Bank had received this audit report.

        371. In addition, in order for the national Government to extend its
              guarantee to the Loan Agreement,462 it first had to sign a Counter-
              Guarantee Agreement463 with the District of Cartagena under which
              the District, if it defaulted on the Bank loan, would hand over to the
              Government the funds it had pledged for this Project. The Loan,
              Project, and Guarantee Agreements do not make any reference to this
              Counter-Guarantee Agreement, although this agreement contains a
              number of covenants that have a direct bearing on Project
              implementation and loan repayments. The Panel is concerned that the
              Bank may have overlooked this matter.

        372. Project implementation/supervision. The Panel finds that the Project
              supervision reports are generally satisfactory and quite informative.
              However, the Panel notes that the supervision reports show that the District
              had management problems with billing and collecting the IPU. The Panel
              found one aide-Memoire where the Bank recommended that the District
              improve its IPU tax collection but there is little evidence on file that the
              Bank actively pursued this matter or carried out an in-depth analysis during
              supervision. If this analysis was carried out, the Bank should have then
              prepared a plan of action and discussed it with the District authorities to
              obtain their agreement on the actions to be taken. The Bank could also have
              obtained the endorsement for this plan of action from the Dirección de
              Apoyo Fiscal (DAF) of the Ministry of Finance, the Contralor Distrital, and
              the Contralor Regional. Since the District's loan repayments to the Bank
              depend on tax receipts from the IPU, the issue of the shortfall in IPU
              receipts and the District's underlying financial management weaknesses,
              which the Bank has not yet addressed properly during supervision, remain
              important issues for the Bank to pursue.

        373. The Panel finds that the Bank should have carried out a financial
              management assessment for the District of Cartagena, as the borrower
              of the Bank loan, at the time of Project preparation and appraisal.
              Since it did not, it did not comply with its own policies and procedures
              set out in OP/BP 10.02. Furthermore, during the initial Project
              supervision, while the Bank had an opportunity to address the problem
              of the shortfall in IPU receipts, it did not actively pursue that matter.
              The Panel also finds that the decision making within the Bank, as it
              refers to accepting audit reports that are not fully in compliance with
              the requirements of the Loan Agreement, did not follow Bank

                 procedures. Hence, it did not comply with its own policies and
                 procedures set out in OP/BP 13.05.


1.2. Project Financial and Accounting Statements

         374. Project preparation and appraisal. The Requesters claim that the Bank
                 accepted inaccurate accounting and financial statements from the city of
                 Cartagena and did not take into accounts reports by Cartagena's Mayoral
                 Office of Internal Control showing the unreliability of the city's accounting
                 system and indicating that the city's Statement of Finances did not provide
                 an accurate assessment of the city's economic situation. As stated, the
                 records reviewed by the Panel show that the Bank realized early in Project
                 preparation and at appraisal that the District of Cartagena did not have the
                 capacity to properly implement the Project and, specifically, to handle
                 Project funds. Audit reports prepared by Government auditors had
                 highlighted internal control problems in municipal management. Therefore,
                 to ensure reliable Project management and control of Project funds, the
                 Bank sought to obtain an agreement to appoint ACUACAR as the Project's
                 implementing entity and the District as the borrower of record.

         375. The Panel notes that part of the reason for channeling Project funds directly
                 to ACUACAR, the Project implementing agency, and having ACUACAR
                 manage the Project rather than passing through normal municipal processes
                 was to ensure proper Project accounting and the preparation of reliable
                 Project financial statements.464 In other words, to avoid, inter alia, any
                 accounting problems, the Project was designed in such a way that the
                 District would not handle any Project funds. Thus the Panel finds that the
                 agreed institutional and financial arrangements for the Project
                 specifically address the uncertainties in the claimants' complaint, and
                 that the processes followed comply with the Bank's OP 10.02.

         376. The Panel notes that the Request points out that there are also other
                 uncertainties about Cartagena, such as its capacity to responsibly manage
                 partnerships with private companies like AGBAR, which is the other main
                 shareholder of ACUACAR. To ensure that the partnership agreements are
                 being carried out satisfactorily - particularly regarding ACUACAR's
                 operations, tariff structure and levels, service efficiency, and investment
                 requirements - an independent operational audit465 is carried out each year

464ACUACAR keeps the Project accounts and corresponding financial statements separately from its own
accounts, and has both sets audited each year by external independent auditors--for 2000 and 2001 Arthur
Andersen, and for 2002 and 2003 Deloitte, Touche, and Tohmatsu. In each of these years, the auditors'
opinion on the Project accounts and financial statements and on ACUACAR's accounts and financial
statements was "unqualified"--that is, in the auditors' opinion the accounts and statements gave a true and
fair view of the financial position of the Project and of ACUACAR. ACUACAR is also audited by both the
Contraloria Distrital and the Contraloria General de la Republica.
465For more details about the audit process see infra paragraph 397.

                at the request of ACUACAR's Board of Directors466. Given the
                supervision and scrutiny of ACUACAR, the Panel finds that the
                District of Cartagena receives sufficient information and assistance
                from other Government institutions to manage adequately the
                partnership agreements adequately.


1.3. Financial Capacity of the District of Cartagena

       377. The Requesters complain that the potential for the fiscal instability of the
                borrower, due to "fiscal disarray and increasingly strained resources,"
                coupled with "the expected increase in the total cost of the outfall project"
                will lead the District to default on the Bank loan.467 The Requesters argue
                that "[b]ecause the City of Cartagena has been plagued by fiscal
                mismanagement and corruption for decades and has only recently and
                slowly begun working to put its finances in order, it is not at all clear that it
                is currently equipped to take on a US$85 million debt from the World Bank
                [...]468." In the Requesters' view, the residents of Cartagena will ultimately
                be those who bear the consequences of such event. They believe that a
                default would "hit hardest at home by sending the City into a cycle of
                restructuring that would extend the burden of the loan(s) far longer than
                anticipated, divert resources from other social projects, and generally
                injure the already fragile local economy469."               In addition, such default
                would damage future prospects for Cartagena as it would "prevent it [the
                City] from obtaining funding for municipal projects for years to come.470"

       378. In its Response, Management argues that because of the work carried out in
                Project preparation and supervision "along with the successful outcome of
                the project financial structure to date, the risk that the District of Cartagena
                would default on its debt service obligations for the project is small.471" The
                Response explains that during Project preparation, analysis of the District's
                financial capacity led to reduce the "District's level of commitment and the
                overall initial loan amount.472"           In addition, "assumptions and analysis
                results were discussed extensively with the District, the Government and
                ACUACAR, and the parties agreed on the viability and risk level of the
                revised financial structure.473" Management concludes that "the past two
                years have demonstrated that the financial mechanisms of the loan are
                robust with the District reducing its cash debt from 62 billion Colombian


466The District has two representatives on that Board of five Directors ­one of which is the Mayor of

                 Pesos to nearly zero by the end of 2003, while all the funds earmarked for
                 Project investment and loan repayment have been transferred to the trust
                 funds". Management believes thus that the risk of default raised by the
                 Requesters "is minimal."474

         379. The Panel observes that the District's financial projections, which the Bank
                 reviewed during Project preparation, showed that the District could afford
                 the level of financial obligations that the Project required. However, other
                 than agreeing on performance indicators with the District to improve IPU
                 collection rates, improve debt coverage ratios, and increase operational
                 surpluses, the Bank neither sought nor included as part of the Project any
                 technical assistance or a plan of action to improve IPU billings and
                 collections and reduce the District's operating costs. These actions were
                 necessary to achieve the District's financial projections.

         380. At the time of the Bank's appraisal of the Project, the Ministry of Finance,
                 Dirección de Credito Público (DCP), independently carried out its own
                 appraisal of the District's financial situation, a step the Government requires
                 before extending a guarantee of the Loan Agreement made by the Bank to
                 the District. The DCP report of May 31, 1999, concluded that the District
                 was in viable financial condition to assume a Bank loan of US$85 million
                 and recommended that the Government provide the guarantee to the Bank.
                 That same report recommended that the District strengthen its capacity to
                 collect taxes and rationalize its expenses. As a counter-guarantee, the
                 Government requested that the District pledge to the Government the same
                 funds it had pledged to the Project.

         381. In 2000 the District fell into a financial crisis. On June 27, 2001, the
                 Ministry of Finance, through the DAF, agreed with the District on a five-
                 year structural adjustment program that includes debt rescheduling, drastic
                 cuts in operating expenses, and limits on indebtedness. DAF closely
                 supervises the structural adjustment program. Its supervision report of June
                 30, 2004, concluded that the District's finances are clearly improving but
                 that it has to continue generating operational surpluses to fully comply with
                 its agreements with DAF.

         382. Pledged and earmarked tax revenue projections475 up to 2016 show that
                 these sources of funds should be sufficient to repay the Bank loan.
                 Depending on the assumptions made, by September 15, 2016--the date the
                 District's last loan installment is due to the Bank--the trust fund at La
                 Previsora is estimated to show a balance between zero and US$8 million.476


474Management Response, Annex 1, Item 15, p.40.
475These projections are available in the Project file. A sensitivity analysis was made assuming different
growth, inflation, and exchange rates.
476Assuming no growth in the Colombian economy and a 6% annual inflation rate and Col.$ devaluation
rate vis-á-vis the US$, the trust fund would end with a surplus balance of about US$1 million.


                                                     133

               The District's financial position as of September 30, 2004, showed a budget
               surplus of about Col.$20 billion or US$7.8 million.477 A surplus of about
               Col.$22 billion was estimated for the end of 2004.

       383. Several people interviewed by the Panel stated that great political pressures
               were directed toward renegotiating the DAF's program, including another
               rescheduling of the District's internal national debts and an attempt to de-
               pledge tax revenues, including those that guarantee loan repayments to the
               Bank. For the near future, the District is considering large investments that
               are estimated to cost about US$250 million equivalent: (a) a mass transit
               system in Cartagena, (b) the construction of a road bordering the Ciénaga de
               la Virgen, (c) the completion of civil works for a hospital, and (d) city
               infrastructure improvements to enable the District to host the Pan-American
               Games. On August 2, 2004, one of the district's senators requested the
               President of the Republic to transfer to the District the funds that are in the
               trust fund at La Previsora--which are to be used exclusively to repay the
               loan to the Bank. Answering in the name of the President, DAF indicated
               that the Government is willing to review the request as long as it is in
               compliance with the international agreements signed with the Bank, the
               fiduciary trust fund agreement signed between the District and La Previsora,
               and the counter-guarantee agreement signed between the District and the
               Government. The Director of DAF indicated to the Panel that Colombia
               would ensure that the District fully honors its commitments under the Loan
               Agreement. As of October 26, 2004, the trust fund account amounted to the
               equivalent of US$14.8 million; however, in 2005 the District will have to
               make about US$8.7 million in principal and interest repayments to the
               Bank.

       384. On the basis of present cost estimates, there should be sufficient funds
               available to complete Project implementation. Since the outcome of the first
               bidding process for the main Project components was well over the PAD's
               and the detailed Engineer's cost estimates, ACUACAR proposed a different
               procurement approach to generate more competition and get prices more in
               line with original estimates and available Bank financing. As a result of the
               re-bidding, several contracts came below these original estimates. In dollar
               terms these revised prices were also the result of the depreciation of the US
               dollar vis-à-vis the Colombian peso. On the basis of the actual results of
               these new bids, Management informed the Panel that the cost of all works
               and equipment procured under the Project up to June 20, 2005, (including
               the Paraíso pumping station, the on-shore pressure pipe and works for the
               wastewater treatment plant) amounts to the equivalent of about US$84
               million. The only components yet to be procured are the wastewater
               treatment plant equipment (with an Engineers's cost estimate equivalent to
               Col.$6 million) and the submarine outfall (with an Engineers's cost estimate

4772005 through 2010 financial projections show increasing operational surpluses from Col.$21 billion (or
US$7.2 million equivalent) in 2005 to Col.$50 billion (or US$12.8 million equivalent) in 2010.


                                                   134

            equivalent to US$23 million). According to Management, although these
            Project costs may be affected by exchange rates movements and the actual
            bids for the remaining components, the results of the successful re-bidding
            process indicate that "the entire project cost will be no higher than the
            estimated cost at appraisal, and might be even lower."  478


      385. Project implementation/supervision. Bank supervision reports provide a
            great deal of information about the District's compliance with the
            performance monitoring indicators that had been agreed with the Bank.
            However, the Panel found no information on file about the District's efforts
            to improve IPU billings and collections and reduce its operating expenses,
            although the Bank recommended many times that the District do so. No
            evidence was found that the Bank ever developed a plan of action for its
            recommendations to the District. In addition, the Panel found no discussion
            on file about the District's progress toward and compliance with targets and
            agreements specified in the adjustment program with DAF. The Bank
            appears to have been oblivious to this adjustment program, which seems to
            have been a separate and unrelated exercise that had no relation to the
            Project. According to statements made to the Panel's financial consultant,
            DAF would have been interested in, and would have supported, Bank
            recommendations in the financial area. The Panel was informed that the
            Panel's consultant was the first person from the Bank working on this
            Project to visit DAF. Thus it appears that the Bank's financial supervision
            was limited to discussions with and receipt of information from the District.
            Furthermore, no evidence is on file that the Bank discussed its
            recommendations on financial matters with the Contralor Distrital or the
            Contralor Regional to enlist their support.

      386. The Panel observes that it appears that the Bank's main concern was to
            ensure that the District had the funding required to finance its share of
            Project costs and to repay the Bank loan. There is little evidence that the
            Bank made efforts to improve the District's financial management and
            finances in general, beyond seeking agreements on certain performance
            monitoring targets with the District. By failing to take full advantage of
            Project supervision work, the Bank missed an opportunity to strengthen the
            District's financial capacity. The Panel notes that although from a strict
            Project point of view the Bank carried out its due diligence in
            accordance with its policies and procedures, it misjudged the
            importance to the Project of improving the borrower's capacity to
            collect the IPU taxes. Pledging a percentage of IPU revenues was not
            enough to guarantee that the District would be able to meet its financial
            obligations to the Project.

2. Financial Management Assessment and Financial Capacity of ACUACAR

2.1. Financial Management Assessment ACUACAR
        387. Project preparation and appraisal. The PAD indicates that "a project
              financial management assessment was carried out by a LAC Region
              Financial Management Specialist (FMS)," who "concluded that ACUACAR
              has all the necessary capacity to manage the financial affairs of the project
              in accordance with Bank standards.479"               As a result of its review of
              ACUACAR, the Panel confirms the Bank's assessment. However, although
              the PAD provides a brief summary of the assessment, the Panel found no
              evidence on file showing that an assessment was made in line with the Bank
              guidelines of that time (the FARAH of January 1995).

        388. Because ACUACAR has strong capacity to manage Project funds, during
              loan negotiations the Bank agreed to ACUACAR's request that the Bank
              loan would be disbursed on the basis of quarterly Project management
              reports (PMRs). According to Section 4.01(b) of the Loan Agreement, the
              PMRs should be audited each year by independent auditors who should
              provide a separate audit opinion on the PMRs. Although the external audit
              reports480 for the Project accounts, Project financial statements, and special
              account have all been received and provide the auditor's "unqualified
              opinion," they do not contain a separate opinion on PMRs. Bank FMSs are
              of the view that since the audit reports and auditor's opinion refer to the
              relevant legal agreement clauses--Section 4.01 (a) and (b)--the auditor has
              indicated that it has examined the PMRs. These PMRs are the instrument
              for disbursing the loan. In addition to Project financial reporting, they
              include both a Project progress report on output monitoring and a
              procurement management report. Therefore, the Panel notes that it would
              have been more appropriate for the auditors to provide a separate opinion
              on the PMRs. The Panel did not find any evidence on file showing who
              approved the decision that there was no need for a separate audit opinion on
              PMRs, in spite of the provision in the Loan Agreement and that the Loan
              Department consulted about this decision.

        389. The Panel finds that the Bank carried out an adequate financial
              management assessment on ACUACAR in accordance with Bank
              policies and procedures.

        390. With respect to supervision of ACUACAR, the Panel finds that the
              supervision reports on financial management are very complete and
              informative. Aside from the shortcomings of the audit reports noted
              above, the Bank has covered this aspect, including financial and
              operational internal control matters, very thoroughly.

2.2. Financial Capacity--ACUACAR

        391. Project preparation and appraisal. The Panel notes that the PAD shows
               that the Bank carried out an in-depth financial analysis of ACUACAR and
               ascertained that ACUACAR was able to fulfill all its financial obligations
               under the Project. The analysis showed that ACUACAR had the financial
               capacity to repay all of its outstanding debts, including a total of US$15.4 in
               debt service, payable to the District in annual amounts of US$2.2 million
               between 2005 and 2011. Actual financial results show that ACUACAR has
               not only been able to fulfill all of its financial obligations to date, but has
               also generated sufficient profits between 2000 and September 2004 to pay
               dividends of the equivalent of US$4 million and US$3.67 million,
               respectively, to the District and to Aguas de Barcelona (AGBAR), the
               private company that manages ACUACAR and holds 45.913% of its
               shares.481 Furthermore, between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2004,
               ACUACAR also provided AGBAR with additional payments amounting to
               the equivalent of US$5.42 million (for a total of US$ 9.1 million when
               dividend payments are included). A breakdown of the US$ 5.42 million
               shows that ACUACAR paid AGBAR (a) a "technical assistance fee" of
               about 3.5%482 of total billing revenues collected, or US$4.6 million, and (b)
               return on capital or "Fondo de Recuperacion de Capital Privado," which
               amounted to US$0.82 million.

        392. ACUACAR's recent financial projections for the period 2004 through 2011
               show that it has the capacity to fulfill its obligations under the Project
               Agreement--it can continue paying off its debts and still make dividend
               payments to its shareholders and technical assistance fees to AGBAR. A
               detailed copy of these projections is available in the Project file. The most
               important assumptions made in preparing the 2004-2011 financial
               projection refer to tariffs and water/sewerage bill collection rates. As far as
               tariffs are concerned, the forecast assumption is that the tariff structure and
               levels agreed with the Water and Sewerage Regulatory Authority (CRAPS)
               under resolutions CRA 08 and 09 of 1995 and CRA 151 of 2000, which are
               in force until December 2005, will be applied, and that after that date, no
               "real" increases will be made (tariff increases will only keep up with
               inflation). Regarding collection rates, it was assumed that average collection
               efficiency rates would be 90%; that is, 10% of the billing would remain
               outstanding. During the first six months of 2004 the collection rate was
               91.71%, a large improvement over the 85.2% rate achieved in 2002 and
               2003. Moreover, a resolution--CRA287 of May 2004--introduces
               efficiency factors into the tariffs to be charged by all water and sewerage
               service providers. ACUACAR believes that the tariff levels, which will

482This percentage varies and is established each year by ACUACAR's Board of Directors


                                                   137

            have to be renegotiated with CRAPS and the Superintendencia de Servicios
            Publicos Domiciliarios (SSPD) before the end of 2005, will not change
            significantly.

       393. As of September 30, 2004, ACUACAR had spent the equivalent of about
            US$3.5 million in energy costs, and it expected to have spent about US$4.7
            million by year-end. However, in 2006, when the submarine outfall is
            expected to become operational and all the planned water and sewerage
            connections are in place, the energy costs will jump to about US$5.6
            million, mainly because of the very large increase in pumping required to
            send the sewerage over more than 20 km north and into the sea. It is
            estimated that about one-third of the total energy costs from 2006 on will be
            related to sewerage. In 2004 energy costs represented about 45% of direct
            operational costs, and in 2006 this percentage will increase to about 51%.
            ACUACAR foresees that increases in services, in both sewerage and water
            connections, will increase total revenues and hence cover most of the
            energy cost increases.

       394. The Panel finds that the Bank satisfactorily carried out its due diligence
            during Project preparation with regard to ascertaining ACUACAR's
            financial capacity in line with its policies and procedures.

2.3. Bank Supervision of ACUACAR

       395. The Panel notes that the Bank has supervised financial and operating
            matters closely. Not only did the Bank monitor compliance with
            performance monitoring indicators, but it also kept in close contact with
            ACUACAR's management, suggesting improvements in both financial
            management and operational matters. The relationship with ACUACAR
            was and remains very close. The Bank discusses its supervision report
            recommendations with ACUACAR. It appears that there was no need to
            develop action plans on the Bank's recommendations since ACUACAR
            was receptive to making improvements as recommended.

       396. The Request states that "ACUACAR now operates almost beyond any
            external checks on its control over designing and executing the City's
            Master Water and Sewerage Plan, of which the outfall project is a major
            component; evaluating bids and awarding contracts; and managing project
            finances."

       397. The Panel notes that the Superintendencia de Servicios Publicos
            Domiciliarios (Superintendence for Public Household Services- SSPD)
            carries out yearly operational audits on ACUACAR, and particularly
            reviews whether (a) the yearly investments agreed under the City's Master
            Plan have been implemented, and (b) as stated before the tariff structure and
            levels applied by ACUACAR are in line with the tariffs that have been

               approved under resolutions CRA 08 and 09 of 1995 and CRA 151 of 2000.
               SSPD also ensures that the quality and efficiency of service are in line with
               agreed targets. In addition, at the request of ACUACAR's Board of
               Directors,    ACUACAR            has hired    external     independent         auditors
               (PriceWaterhouseCoopers) to carry out yearly operational audits that use
               terms of reference that are similar to SSPD's but also include a review of
               ACUACAR's financial internal control procedures and cost and revenue
               projections. Moreover, ACUACAR's accounts, financial statements, and
               the processes by which it procures goods, works, and services are also
               audited each year by external independent auditors (Deloitte, Touche, and
               Tohmatsu), and the audit report is sent to ACUACAR's Board, where the
               District has two representatives--one of them the Mayor of Cartagena.
               Furthermore, ACUACAR's operations and accounts are also audited by the
               Contraloría General de la República on a rotating basis, as well as by the
               Contraloría Distrital.

         398. In addition, to all this, at least twice a year the Bank carries out formal
               Project supervision missions in line with standard Bank practices reflected
               in OP/BP 13.05 and ascertains that Project implementation is in compliance
               with the Loan and Project Agreements. Project supervision reports prepared
               by the Bank show that ACUACAR executes procurement processes, signs
               contracts, and manages Project funds as part of standard implementing
               agency responsibilities. So far ACUACAR has complied strictly with the
               provisions of the Project Agreement, including seeking the Bank's no-
               objection for all important activities related to Project execution. Hence, the
               Panel finds that the Bank closely supervises the performance of
               ACUACAR and is in compliance with its policy on Project supervision,
               OP/BP 13.05.

3. Risk of default on the Bank loan

         399. The Requesters claim that the District of Cartagena did not have the
               financial capacity to take a US$85 million loan and the citizens of
               Cartagena will ultimately bear the consequences of this. In responding to
               this complaint it would be useful first to explain the Project finances and
               forecast, and the District's financial obligations toward the Project. With
               this perspective it is easier to judge the likelihood of default.

         400. The original total Project cost estimates were US$117.18 equivalent. This
               amount was to be financed by a Bank loan to the District of US$85 million,
               a contribution from the national Government of US$20 million equivalent, a
               contribution from the District of US$7.58 million equivalent,483 and a
               contribution from ACUACAR of US$ 4.60 million equivalent. In addition
               to its Project contribution, the District is responsible for repaying the US$85

483This amount has already been transferred to ACUACAR. Therefore, the District has already fulfilled its
Project funding obligation.

                million Bank loan plus the interest and other charges on the outstanding
                principal of said loan. ACUACAR will shoulder US$15.4 million of loan
                repayments, reducing the District's loan (principal) repayment liabilities to
                US$69.6 million. As of June 21, 2005, the equivalent of US$36million had
                been disbursed from the Loan account, and thus about US$49 million
                remained to be disbursed.            To fund the remaining Project costs the
                following amounts are also available: US$20 million equivalent in interest-
                bearing bank accounts held by ACUACAR on behalf of the Project; and
                US$1.8 million equivalent which has been included by the national
                Government in its 2005 budget.484

         401. The Panel finds that at the time of Project preparation the Bank
                carried out detailed financial analyses and projections, including
                sensitivity tests, on the revenue and cost statements for the District of
                Cartagena and ACUACAR. These are summarized in the PAD. Also, to
                ensure that the District would not default on Bank loan repayments, the
                District agreed with the Bank (aside from the guarantee of the national
                Government) to pledge and earmark specific tax receipts485 for Project
                funding and loan repayment. Moreover, ACUACAR's financial projections,
                which have also been reviewed by the IP's financial specialist, indicate that
                ACUACAR has the capacity to fulfill its obligations under the Project
                Agreement. The Panel finds that the Bank adequately carried out
                financial projections for the District as well as for ACUACAR and
                reached satisfactory institutional arrangements to ensure proper
                Project financing and loan repayment. The Panel finds that the Bank
                carried out its due diligence with regard to repayment of the loan in
                line with OP/BP10.02.




484 The difference between Project cost savings and the surplus available is the payment of the Bank fee out
of the loan.

                       discussed extensively with District,

       Report by Jorg Imberger,               Professor of Environmental Engineering

1.0 Introduction

The following is a relatively detailed assessment of the proposed outfall design put
forward by the consultant firm Hazen and Sawyer for the disposal of the wastewater
originating from the greater city of Cartagena. Currently this wastewater is allowed to
flow or seep into either the Bay of Cartagena or the Tesca Lagoon to the immediate north
of the main city. It is important to keep in mind that any disposal system will be an
improvement on the current situation, but it is also important to ensure, from the Bank's
perspective that any new disposal system should be designed according to "best practice"
even though the loan is to a developing country and the current situation can only be
described as disastrous. In this report I shall confine my comments to the design of the
proposed outfall, other members of the Inspection Panel will report on the various other
aspects of the whole World Bank Loan project.

2.0 General Design Considerations

2.1 Dilution
Outfalls achieve their effectiveness by two principles, dilution and increased residence
time of the effluent before impacting on either the coastal margin, a marine protected area
or on areas used for recreation or fishing. The dilution is achieved first directly by plume
mixing as the lighter effluent water rises vertically through the coastal water column; this
is called near field dilution. Once at the surface the background oceanic dispersion and or
buoyant spreading further mixes the surface effluent plume, but this additional mixing is
usually much slower than the near field dilution and requires a large area before
becoming an effective mechanism; this is called far field dispersion. Far field dispersion
and transport, however, are also used, in a properly designed outfall system, to prevent
the effluent-ocean water mixture from impacting on sensitive areas for a time sufficient
to allow the sunlight and the ocean salinity to break down potentially dangerous
pathogens. Typically, an outfall configuration is designed to use both the initial dilution
in the near field and the retention time in the far field to ensure the safe disposal of the
three different classes of pollutants in a domestic sewage effluent; pathogens, nutrients
and synthetic organics.

2.2 Pathogens
Pathogens, measured with indicator species such as total or fecal coliforms, occur in raw
effluents in concentrations of about 1011 counts m-3. In order to be safe for human contact


                                             154

their concentration must, in general, be reduced to 107 counts m-3, a reduction of 104
(Roberts (2004)). This may be achieved by bringing the effluent water close to the ocean
water surface so that sunlight can kill the pathogens after the effluent has been diluted by
the action of the outfall diffuser. The project assumed that pathogens decayed by factor of
10 every 2 hours (Hazen and Sawyer (1998), Figure 1).




Figure 1: Total Coliform Decay Rate, based on Figure 8-21 Hazen and Sawyer (1998).
No description is given on the environmental conditions at which the tests were carried
out.

With this assumption the effluent plume water must be brought to the ocean surface with
a dilution of 10 and then remain in direct sunlight for a period of 8 hours before
impacting on either the Punta Canoas shore area or the traditional fishing areas of the
Afro-Columbian community. This time may be a shorter depending on the dilution in the
diffuser plume. The above assumed death rate was based on tests carried out by Hazen
and Sawyer (1998) and these data are reproduced in Figure 1. The graph was extrapolated
to about 8 hours for convenience.

Four major issues must be raised with respect to the data shown in Figure 1.
    · The decay rate is a strong function of light intensity, temperature and salinity.




                                             155

Figure 2a: Decay Properties of Coliform as a Function of Insolation (Sinton et al (1999)).




                                        156

Neither the temperature nor the salinity vary greatly at the site under consideration, but
the light intensity does. In general the cumulative death is a function of total irradiance as
seen in Figure 2 (Sinton et al (1999)). The Solar insolation in Cartagena would most
likely vary from 10 to 20 MJm-2d-1 so from Figure 2, an organisms close to the water
surface would decay by a factor of 104 in the 12 hour of daylight. This agrees with the
data presented by the proponents.




        Figure 2b: Published linear decadic absorption coefficients of pure liquid H2O
        in the 300­700-nm region. Caption and figure from Litjens et al (1999).

The key that relates the symbols in this figure with the authors and references and
detailed conditions of measurement are given in Litjens et al (1999). The thick curve
shows the means of 27 literature values, plotted at 10-nm intervals from actual data or
interpolated data ~provided that a sufficient number of points were available. Because of
the large divergences of literature values in the 300­400-nm region, the literature mean is
not continued below 400 nm. The thin curve shows the means, similarly plotted, of
triplicate determinations from the present study at 298.1 K. Many of the literature values
in the 300­400-nm region are so large they do not fit on the graph. Each of these values
is designated by an arrow that marks the wavelength and by a number that indicates the
linear decay absorption coefficient in inverse meters. A similar problem associated with
the recent determination by Ravisankar et al (1988) in the 400­700-nm region is dealt
with in the same way. The small dots between 300 and 320 nm represent the edge of the
accurate data for the 200­320-nm region determined on highly pure water in a previous
study from our laboratory.

However, organisms in an effluent plume do not all aggregate near the water surface, but
rather are contained, most likely, uniformly in the surface layer. Below we derive an


                                            157

expression for the thickness of the surface layer, but let us assume here that it is h and
that all organisms are mixed uniformly within this surface layer. Further if H0 is the
insolation at the water surface then the insolation H at depth z is given by (Fischer et al
(1979)):
                                  H  = e-kz,
                                 H0
where z is the water depth and k is the extinction coefficient for the radiation wavelength
that has the maximum impact on such micro-organisms ( the most effective wavelength
depends on the organism, but the UVA and UVB wavelength is usually most effective,
see Figure 2b) . Hence if h is the depth of the layer of effluent and H0 is the surface
radiation then the average radiation for the surface effluent plume is given by the
                                          h
                                 H =  H0     -kzdz = H0 (1- e-kh)
                                       h  e          kh
                                          0


As seen from Figure 2b the extinction coefficient for wavelengths in the UVA range is
very sensitive to organic impurities in the water column (Litjens et al (1999)); pure water
has a value k=0.05, but even a small amount of impurities takes this up to around k=3.0.
For the case where k = 3 and h = 1, typical for Cartagena waters; one insolation day
becomes three actual days. Hence since little decay occurs over night (Figure 2.) the
effluent water would need to remain "out of harms way" for about three full days, not
simply 8 hours as assumed by the proponents. Further, it must be stressed that different
organisms respond very differently to insolation, with Fecal Coliforms being the most
susceptible to decay and cryptosporidium being most resistant.

    · Recently Littlefield-Wyer (2004) and Power et al (2004) found that under some
        conditions, Coliforms actually grow in the water column, rather than die. It is
        difficult to be quantitative as this work is very new.
    · New evidence has now shown that Fecal and Total Coliform are not good
        indicator species when pathogens such as Cryptosporidium are present (Hipsey et
        al (2004a, b, c) Brookes et al (2004)). These latter organisms can be very
        dangerous to human health and show very much more resistance to decay than
        Coliforms. They also have different binding properties to sediments and so are
        less likely to settle out with any sedimentation. To take this into account a much
        more detailed analysis of the raw sewage would need to be carried out.

The last two points have only recently been documented, so it is reasonable to assume
that Hazen and Sawyer may not have been aware of these complications, but the light
extinction effect is obvious and should have been included.

2.3 Nutrients
Nutrients in an effluent lead to enrichment of the receiving waters. The concentrations
must be diluted close to the background levels in a contained area. Typical concentration
of mineral content in an effluent both dissolved and particulate is around 3×10-1 kgm-3
whereas the average concentration around Punta Canoas is about 3×10-4 kgm-3,



                                              158

requiring a dilution of 1:103 or a factor of 10 less than what is required for safe pathogen
disposal without decay. It would be interesting to know whether the primary production
in the coastal area adjacent to the proposed site is nutrient limited. It is not nutrient
limited then a properly designed outfall would have a negligible impact on the area. On
the other hand if phosphorous is limiting then the outfall effluent would stimulate
primary production which in turn would faster growth in the upper levels of the trophic
food chain; most likely the fish density would increase. There did not appear to be any
discussion in the various reports on the nutrient status of the water, but given that the
Magdalena River has a strong influence in the area it is likely that light is the limiting
factor.


2.4 Organic Load
Organic load from an effluent, without appropriate dilution, can draw down the oxygen
levels in the surrounding waters to undesirable levels. Typically, untreated effluent has a
BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand or the loss of oxygen concentration in 5 days) of
around 100mg/l. The receiving water near Punta Canoas has a BOD (Red de Vigilancia
para la Conservación y las Aguas Marinas y Costeras de Colombia (REDCAM (2003)) of
around 0. 1 mg/l. Hence BOD again requiring a dilution of around 1:103.

2.5 Synthetic Organics
Typically, domestic effluent contains a large number of substances such as pesticides,
herbicides and hormones, the latter being the substances most recently receiving attention
because they interrupt the nature genetic balance of secondary produces, including fish.
There is no discussion in the report about the probability that such substances could lead
to problems. Given that the Magdalena is essentially a sewer for all of Colombia, it is
unlikely that such substances will have a greater impact than already exists. However, a
discussion about the potential problems would have been useful.


3.0 The Proposed Outfall Design

3.1 The Location
The Municipality of Cartagena is situated on the coast of the Caribbean Ocean as shown
in Figure 3a. The City has a population of about 1 million people, 750,000 of who are
classified in the 1, 2 or 3 poverty categories. The site on which the city was built contains
the Bay of Cartagena to the south of the city and the Lagoon of Tesca to the immediate
north of the main city. The other feature that is noteworthy is the Marine National Park
about 30 km south of the City, the main attraction there being the coral reef ecology. As
seen from Figure 3b the bathymetry (Courtesy Serguei Lonin, CIOH) is such that the
depth falls of quite rapidly, particularly opposite Punta Canoas, the proposed site for the
outfall.

3.2 The Assimilative Capacity of the Area

The Colombian Caribbean Coast comprises complex and dynamic ecosystems whose
main biological environments are estuaries, bays, coastal lagoons, coral reefs and
mangrove ecosystems. The region is home to many different activities from
manufacturing industries, located mainly in Cartagena and Barranquilla-, an oil terminal
and refinery, international maritime and trade terminals, the Carrejón minefield, the
tourism industry, the agrochemical industry, small-scale and industrial fishing,
agriculture, salt mines, among others.

The continental Caribbean region, through its water systems, is receptor of the
environmental impacts of the natural and anthropogenic processes of the Andean region
that, together with the Caribbean region itself, houses nearly 90% of the population of the
Columbia. The main hydrographical basin influencing the Caribbean Coast is the
Magdalena Basin, covering a large portion of the centre and north of Colombia. The
Magdalena river flows northward through the Colombia's Andes along 1540 km down to
the Caribbean Sea (Figure 3b). Along the way, this River is the main pathway for organic
and particulate material generated by the main Metropolitan areas of Colombia. The river
has an average discharge of 7100 m3/s and a watershed of 250000 Km2. Although it is
known that this River carries high levels of contaminants to the Sea, the influence these
substances have on the biological and chemical process of this Region is largely
unknown.

In order to gain an appreciation of the potential influence of the proposed outfall on a
regional scale and assess the assimilative capacity of the region it is useful to compare the
loads from the proposed outfall to those originating from the Magdalena River that drains
most of Columbia and enters the ocean near Barranquilla about 100 km north of
Cartagena. The comparisons are shown in Table 1. From Table 1 it is seen that the
impact of the proposed outfall is very small in terms of freshwater input, small in terms
of nutrient and organic load, but comparable in terms the pathogen load. However, it is
important to note that when considering pathogens it is the concentration that counts and
not the total load. In terms of concentration, the water from the Magdalena is marginally
acceptable (approximately equal to upper immersion limit), but the concentration of the
outfall effluent is 104 too high for pathogens and 103 too high in terms of nutrients. Thus
in terms of assimilative capacity the Punta Canoas coastal waters are a suitable site for an
outfall, but the outfall must produce at least a dilution of 1:103 in order to produce
acceptable nutrient levels and must have a decay rate for pathogens of at least 1:10
combined with the dilution to reduce the pathogens to an acceptable level.

     3.3 Regional Ocean Currents

     The meteorology of the Caribbean region is dominated by the seasonal movement of the
     Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). From November to March the ITCZ is located
     over South America, resulting in relatively uniform strong easterly trade wind over the
     Caribbean region. From July to September the location to the ITCZ shifts northward to
     the middle of the Caribbean Sea with a corresponding weakening of the winds (Andrade,
     1993).

     The Caribbean Basin has been extensively studied. Gyory et al(2004) provide a summary
     of the work including the historical hydrographical surveys of Wust (1964) and Gordon
     (1967), the Caribbean circulation observations and numerical modelling of Kinder
     (1985), results of satellite tracked drifting buoy experiment conducted by Molinari
     (1981), Morrison and Smith (1990), studies of seasonal variability of Geostrophic
     transport, along with the observations and numerical models of Johns et al (2002). These
     studies indicated that the water flows into The Caribbean Sea mostly through de Grenada,
     San Vincent and Santa Lucia Passages in the southeast. Ones inside the Caribbean basin
     the water continues westward as the Caribbean Current (CC) as shown in Figure 4, the
     main surface circulation in the Caribbean Sea.




     Figure 4: Regional annual average current in the Caribbean (reproduced from Gyory
     et al (2004)).

     The Panama-Columbian gyre has also been verified with extensive drogue tracking by
     Molinari (1981); some results are reproduced in Figure 5a and b.


                                                 163

Figure 5a: The corresponding speeds of the trajectories, shown in the spaghetti plots,
are color-coded from low speeds in purples and dark blue colors to measured buoy
speeds of over 100 cm/s in black. Major currents are clearly visible in these plots with
concentrated "ribbons" of red, pink, and black. Also note that in the ocean interior,
the predominant speed is 5-15 cm/s, and that in the more energetic eddy regions near
the major currents, the predominant speed is from 20-40 cm/s. (Reproduced from
Gyory et al (2004)).




Figure 5: The corresponding direction (heading/bearing) of the buoys in degrees
relative to North (0/360°) which is dark blue. Due south (180°) is red, while due west
(270°) is yellow and due east (90°) is cyan. So for example, light blue implies the buoy
is heading toward the northeast and orange implies the buoy is heading toward the
southwest. (Reproduced from Gyory et al (2004)).



However, the circulation in the gyre is highly variable in both space and time with
evidence from numerical simulations indicating a periodicity in the gyre of about 4 days


                                          164

(Villegas and Imberger, 2005), but a consistent stagnation point along the Columbian
coast close to where the Magdalena River enters the ocean.

The unsteady nature of the regional circulation was investigated by Pujos et al (1986)
who conducted a field campaign in November 1981 in which he documented the
temperature and salinity field. He found two cyclonic cells, the first located on the west
of the El Rosario Islands and the second to the west of the Magdalena river mouth. (see
also Rodríguez and Galvis, 1999, Cañon and Santamaría, 2003, Andrade, 2000 ). Nystuen
and Andrade (1993) used Geosat Exact Repeat Mission altimetry data to detect and track
the movement of mesoscale sea surface height anomalies. Quasi-permanent cyclonic
eddies were detected near the south western portion of the Colombia basin in agreement
with the model predictions of Semtner and Chervin (1992) and Thompson et al (1992).

Andrade and Barton (2000) followed up this earlier work of the eddy development and
motion in the Caribbean Sea by using the ERS-1 altimetry data corrected by
TOPEX/Poseidon data. For the first time results indicate that not just anticyclones but
also cyclones eddies travelled along the Caribbean Sea north of 150N. The outcome of
their work refers at the Panama-Colombia Gyre as a feature evident only during the
tropical rainy season. However, very recent work by Villegas and Imberger (2005)
suggests that the Panama-Columbian gyre is actually a series of gyres that progressively
move towards the Columbian coast with a period of about 4 days and which induce a
maximum current at about 50m. Analysis of Hydrographic data together with current
measurements take during the 1990s in the Colombia, Venezuela and Granada Basins
also suggested an eastward flowing subsurface current along the entire southern boundary
of the Caribbean Sea (Andrade, Barton and Mooers (2003)). However, the easterly trade
winds induce a westward flowing surface current throughout most of the region.
(Villegas and Imberger (2005)

3.4 The Near Coastal Regime
The coastal ocean currents off Punta Canoa are available from a number of current meters
and the EIA deployed an ADCP for an extensive period at a number of sites, including at
the proposed outfall location. A sample of the depth averaged velocity is shown in Figure
6. From the beginning of December to the end of May the water off Punta Canoas flows
south-west with a mean velocity of around 0.2 m/s and in the period from the beginning
of June to the end of November the water flows north-east with a velocity of about 0.2
m/s. However, it is important to note that the data, used by both Sawyer and Hazen and
by Roberts (2003, 2004) for the design of the outfall and shown in Figure 6, are the depth
averaged currents from the bottom to 15 m above the bottom. The currents in the top 5m,
the stratified upper layer, were never considered. This has important consequences, as
we shall see below, during periods where the water column currents are relatively weak
and the water column is stratified. Under such conditions the stratification suppresses
vertical mixing of the surface plume water and also allows the surface water to "slip"
over the top of the stratified layers. An onshore wind thus has the potential for sweeping
the surface effluent plume onto shore.




                                            165

Figure 6 : Currents of Punta Canoas in 20m depth along the principal axis (northeast)
and the minor axis (southwest) from Roberts (2004) "The top bins were often above the
water surface and were not judged to be reliable, so only the bottom four bins, ranging
from heights of 5.3 to 14.3 m (depths of 3.4 to 12.4 m) were used." Note that currents
in the period from about the beginning of December to the end of May flow south-
westward and from the beginning of June to the end of November flow north-eastward.

Clearly evident in the currents depicted in Figure 6 is also a 4 to 6 day periodicity that is
similar to that found in the simulations by Villegas and Imberger (2005), the result of the
multiple gyres in the Panama-Columbian gyre of recirculation region progressively
moving eastward. No mention was made in the Hazen and Sawyer report about these
oscillations.

A sample of the tidal signal, taken near Cartagena, is shown in Figure 7, from which it
may be observed that the tide in the area is predominantly diurnal (once a day) with a
weak semi diurnal signal being evident. A longer record would be required in order to
assess the annual variation between the diurnal and semi-diurnal tides. The amplitude is
about 0.2m, small enough to suggest that near Punta Canoas the tidally induced current
should be quite small. This is confirmed by the measurements shown in Figure 6 that do
not show a significant periodicity at 24 hours.




                                            166

Figure 7: Tides at Cartagena (Data from Dalai Moreno Engel 2004)

The near coastal circulation is thus in a seasonal balance between the propagating
separation eddy that moves eastward with a period of about 4 to 6 days, inducing a north-
east current off Punta Canoa and the south-westerly current surface current induced by
the easterly wind; in Dec to May the wind induced current predominates and in the rest of
the year the separation circulation dominates; there is considerable energy between 4 and
7 days, but little current variation on a diurnal or semi-diurnal time scale.

There seems to be little information on surface coastal currents offshore from Punta
Canoas, but we may obtain a good estimate of such currents from a simple momentum
analysis (Fischer et al 1979). Suppose a wind UW acts on the surface of the water column
stratified as discussed below. The shear velocity exerted by the wind is given by:
                                               1

                                  u* = CDa     2
                                         w      UW = 1.2 ×10-3UW

Now, if h is the depth of the layer adjacent to the water surface that is well mixed by the
turbulence of the wind, called the surface layer and Us is the velocity of the water in the
surface layer, then momentum requires:

                                  d Ush
                                   ( )= u*    2
                                     dt        =1.44 ×10-6UW , 2


for a suddenly started wind and before any pressure gradients are set up.

For the sake of the present discussion, the water column may be approximated as having
a linear stratification (see Figure 8. below) with 0.5 kgm-3 over the top 5m then the
buoyancy frequency N is constant and given by:
                                               1               1

                                  N =  g  2
                                        0 z      =  1025
                                                     9.8 × 0.5 2
                                                          × 5    = 3.1×10-2 s-1 .

If we only account for surface layer deepening due to turbulent stirring then the
entrainment law (Fischer et al 1979) reads:




                                              167

                                h = 1.4 uN (Nt)13 .
                                          *


Combining the above equations yields a relationship for the surface layer water speed:
                               Us = 0.714u* (Nt)23 .
Integrating Us with respect with time yields an expression for the distance L the water in
the surface layer would travel in time t:


                                L = 0.429u*(N)23 t .5
                                                    3

To make this calculation more specific suppose the wind has a speed of 5m/s and acts for
6 hours, then the distance travelled by the water may be obtained by substituting
t = 6 hrs = 2.16 ×104 s which leads to:
                               US = 0.32 ms-1; h = 0.9 m; L = 4081 m .

To first approximation this current will move in the direction of the wind; for a wind with
an onshore component it will move the surface water towards the shore. The wind speed
of 5 m s-1 was chosen as representing the average minimum wind speed (see Figure 7.)
and thus the smallest distance. Larger wind speeds would lead to larger water excursions.
The 4km is thus a lower limit of the distance the surface water may be expected to move
under the action of the wind.

3.5 Water Column Stratification: The Magdalena Plume
The Magdalena River has one further very important regional influence with respect to
the outfall design; it produces a stratified water column off the coast of Punta Canoas as
seen very clearly from the profile data collected as part of the study (see Figure 8).




Figure 8a: Stratification of the water column off Punta Canoas. Note strong
stratification (~0.2 to 1 kg/m3) over the top 3 to 5 meters of the water column in about
50% of the profiles. (From Roberts (2003)).

Clearly visible from the CTD profiles shown in Figure 8a is a density decrease in the top
5 meters of the profiles of around 0.5 kgm-3 . As seen from the summary graph, Figure



                                             168

8b, this difference can reach 1.8 kgm-3 in the months from April to August. If it is
assumed that the density increases linearly with depth in the top 5m then the buoyancy
frequency is given by:
                                      1               1

                        N =   g  2
                              0 z       =  1025
                                            9.8 × 0.5 2
                                                  × 5   = 3.1×10-2 s-1,

providing a measure of the stability of the water column used below in the calculations of
the effluent surface buoyant plume. The density gradient is too weak to prevent the rising
diffuser plume from surfacing, but it is critically important, as shown above, in
determining the behaviour of the far field plume.




Figure 8b: Density difference between surface and bottom water near Punta Canoas
over the year 1998. (Roberts (2003)).

The Magdalena River is the dominant regional freshwater influence and clearly
contributes to the stratified water column off the coast as seen very clearly from satellite
imagery. (Figures 9 a, b, c and d). Other important fluvial sources of freshwater at the
Colombian Caribbean Coast are the Atrato and Sinu Rivers. The Atrato river, with a
monthly average flow rate of 1000 m3/s, outflow at the Uraba Golf; the Sinu river
outflow at the Morrosquillo Golf with an average flow rate of 340 m3/s. Although
seasonal variability is suggested from an along year satellite imaginary analysis, research
has to be done if the real effect of this effluent along the coast has to be established. The
satellite images suggest that the stratification is the result of all the above rivers
contributing a buoyancy flux and the prevailing surface currents determine which is the
most important at a particular time.

The plumes from the three rivers would be governed by Coriolis, wind speed and
direction and the buoyancy flux. However, as seen form the density profiles the buoyancy
flux associated with the discharges ensures that the stratification remains close to the
water surface.

3.6 Winds of the Area
In the analysis of the near field and far field behaviour of the diffuser plume the design or
the EIA did not consider the action of the wind on a stratified water body. Rather the
report presents results from a depth averaged numerical model (RMA Ian King) with
different wind fields, a methodology that does not capture the important influence of the
wind on near surface currents in a stratified water column. Below it is shown that

predominant wind direction is between 250 and 100 Degrees, with 250 to 360 having a

the wind has a critical influence on the far field plume behaviour and hence we give here
a brief summary of the wind behaviour in the outfall area. Data obtained from Dalia
Moreno Egel (Personal communication) was plotted and is shown in Figures 10a and b.
In order to plot both the wind direction and the speed on the same axis the wind speed
was multiplied by 10. The two time periods show much the same behaviour. The

Figure 11: Wind speed and direction, 6 year average from 1958 to 1964 (Vernette et al
(1984)).   These data show that a mean wind speed for winds with an onshore
component is between 5 and 15 m/s, the largest winds being from the north. The
frequency of occurrence of such onshore winds was about 30% of the time, the
predominant direction for onshore winds being from the north.

Figure 12: Wind speed and direction bins from the Hazen and Sawyer report
indicating that when averaged over a year winds blow with an on shore component
(from the west, north west or north) for a total of about 50 % of the time and the winds
are below the measurement threshold (about 0.1m/s) for nearly 25% of the time. Time
period is unknown, but data are similar to those from Vernette et al (1984), shown in
Figure 3c.

wind direction is from the north, but there are an appreciable number of times when the
wind comes from the north-west or west, meaning that the wind has an onshore
component at those times. This is confirmed by the historical data presented by Vernette
et al (1984), shown in Figure 11. In the Hazen and Sawyer Report there is a bar chart,
reproduced in Figure 12, that substantiates the same behaviour; these data show that the
wind has an "onshore component" for about 40% of the time (N, NW, Tranquil and W).
This includes the northerly wind direction as for this case there is a coast line due south
from the proposed diffuser. Speeds for winds with an onshore component range from
zero to 15m/s.


4.0 Harm to Marine Environment and Local Population

4.1 Proposed Outfall Design
The proponents arrived at the proposed outfall design after extensive analysis and
modelling under the assumption that the water column in the area of the outfall was well
mixed vertically. Hazen and Sawyer and Roberts (2003) both came to the conclusion that
the initial dilution, due the action of the rising buoyant jet, would range from 84 (no cross
current) to 860 (for cross currents of magnitude 0.2ms-1). The characteristics of the
proposed outfall are given in Table 1. The proposed outfall contains 54 ports each with a
diameter of 0.2m, a combined flow rate of 3.9 m3s-1 and was to be located at a depth of


                                               173

20 m, a distance of approximately 3 km from Punta Canoas. It should be remembered
that in 2 we showed that it was necessary, for safe disposal of the nutrient and organic
load, to achieve a dilution of 103 and from the perspective of the pathogen concentration
a reduction through dilution and decay of at least 104 was necessary. The near field
dilution results are validated below using simple plume formulae described in Fischer et
al 1979 and appear to be sound estimates. However, by themselves these dilution rates
are insufficient to meet the dilution and residence requirements. We show that the far
field modelling by the proponents does not account the presence of a surface layer and
preliminary calculations show that the present proposed design is unlikely to meet the
requirements for a safe disposal of the effluent.

4.2 Near Field, No Cross Current
Dilution may be calculated from a simple plume volume flux formula (Fischer et al 1979)
                                          1 5
    Volume flux:               µ = 0.15B3z3 ,

where the buoyancy flux is given by B =     
                                                gQi , z is the vertical coordinate and Qi is

the flow rate per port.
With 54 ports located in 20m of water:
                               Qi = 0.072 m3 s-1,
                               g = 9.8 m s-2,
                                  = 1025 - 998   = 0.0263,
                                       1025
leading to                      µ = 5.86m3s-1,
yielding a dilution of          S=79.8.

This dilution is, within the accuracy of the simple plume formula, the same as the lower
limit calculated by Roberts (2003) and (2004) using a more detailed numerical model.


4.3 Near Field, Cross Current (U = 0.2 m/s)
In the studies by Hazen and Sawyer (1998) and those of Roberts (2003), the effect of
cross currents were included leading to a maximum dilution during periods of maximum
cross currents, of around 860. These maximum dilutions were associated with strong
northward flowing currents observed during the period from June to November (see
Figure 11). The effective dilution with a cross current may again by estimated from
simple formulae given in Fischer et al (1979); Tables 9.5 and 9.6. From this reference it
follows:

A value very similar to that presented by Roberts (2003) obtained with numerical model
runs.

We therefore have excellent consistency between the above simple buoyant jet formulae
and the more complex numerical models of Robert (2003 and 2004) and those described
in Hazen and Sawyer, the latter being a derivative of those published by Roberts (2003).
It is worth noting at this stage that the cross current dilution would almost satisfy our
prescribed dilution design criteria, but the still water column conditions fail the design
requirements by a factor of 10.

4.4 Far Field Dispersion and Residency, Vertically Mixed Water
Column
From above it is seen that the near field dilution rates are insufficient and we require an
additional 10 fold dilution for the safe disposal of nutrients and organic matter and either
a 100 fold further dilution in the far field or at least an ocean residency of 36 hours before
making landfall or encroaching into the traditional fishing areas. The location of the
traditional fishing areas is discussed elsewhere in the Panel's report and is not well
documented. For the sake of the present discussion of far field dispersion and residency
we shall assume that fishing takes place out to a distance of 2000m from the shoreline.

We must therefore estimate the additional dilution possibly obtained by natural horizontal
dispersion once the plume has surfaced. Once again Roberts (2003 and 2004), as well as
Hazen and Sawyer (2000) used numerical models to calculate the rate of spread of the
outfall cloud once it had reached the water surface. In Figure 13 we have reproduced one
of the model run results from Robert (2004).

Their model was based on a turbulent dispersion diffusion coefficient as described in
Fischer et al (1979) (see also the more recent account in Stocker and Imberger (2003)).
Such an analysis is valid when the currents shown in Figure 6 are relevant, as would be
the case when the ocean currents are relatively strong (U> 0.05 m s-1). Once again we can
verify the proponents' analysis with a simple analytical calculation. This is useful as it
once again allows us to see the key issued in their analysis. Once the buoyant plume has
surfaced it will be advected with the current speed US and dispersing as it moves with the
water. The proponents assumed a dispersion coefficient
                                                 4
                                        = 10-4l m2s-1,
                                                 3

where l is the length scale of the pollutant cloud and where the coefficient has been
changed form that in Roberts (2003) to conform to standard mksa units. As the pollutant
cloud is swept downstream it will disperse in all directions, but the stream wise
dispersion will be very small compared to the stream wise advection and may thus be
neglected to first order. The dispersion is thus given, to a good approximation by a simple
source diffusing with time in a direction transverse the flow. Solutions of the diffusion
equation have the property that (see Fischer et al 1979) that
                                       dl 2
                                             = 2 ,
                                        dt
substituting for  and carrying out the integration yields an expression for l :

                                                  3
                                                           3
                                       l =   23   2(t+ t0)2   ; = 10-4,

where it was assumed that at t = 0, the width of the plume is given by the width of the
vertical simple plume (20% 0f the water depth):
                                       l0 = 4 m,
so that                                t0 = 3.8 ×104 s .
Now if the plume surfaces with a concentration of C0 and a width of 2l , then it follows
                                                                          0
from conservation of pollutant mass that the mean concentration of the pollutant C as the
effluent is swept downstream becomes:


                                        C       -x
                                            =10          8.6 ×106

where the first term captures the assumed decay rate of pathogens and the second
accounts for the lateral dispersion and the value of the decay coefficient  has been

adjusted to give a factor 10 decay in 140 minutes (see Figure 2.). Substituting
US = 0.15 ms-1and x = 5000 m yields:
                                         C  = 10-4 (0.451)= 4.5 ×10-5 .

                                        C0
The reduction of 10-4 is the effect of the pathogen decay rate and the factor 0.451 is due
to lateral dispersion. This simple calculation clearly shows that the effectiveness or
otherwise of the outfall depends completely on the near field dilution (S = 79.8) and the
assumed rapid decay of the pathogens.

Conclusion: The dilution rates assumed by the proponents agree quantitatively with
values obtained by simple analytical buoyant jet formulae lending support to the assumed
design for the case of an unstratified water column.


4.5 Far Field Dispersion and Residency, Implications of the water
column stratification
We now examine the implications of the near surface stratification as observed at the
proposed site and detailed in Figure 8a.

Case 1: Winds greater than 5 ms-1. Stratified water columns develop surface layers that
trap the momentum introduced by the wind. In the presence of a surface layer, the surface
currents would most likely be better approximated by estimates obtained from the simple
momentum analysis detailed in 3.4 above. From this analysis it follows that during the
months from April to August, when the stratification is maximum, the wind driven
currents will be such as to carry the effluent plume at least a distance of 4km. Given that
the wind has a onshore component for over 50% of the time we may reach the conclusion
that the effluent plume will make contact with the shore line 50% of the time within 6
hours. For this case the initial dilution would be 1:100, the far field dispersion would be
negligible and the time for decay time (residence time) would be 6 hours. The diffuser
design thus fails marginally for nutrients (a factor of 1 to10 too high) and fails completely
for pathogens (a factor of a little less than 100 too high for pathogens residing out of the
immediate surface light).

Case 2: Periods when there is a lull in the wind: The wind data in Figure12 shows that
20% of the time the wind is "tranquil" meaning it is below the threshold of the
instrument. For such situations a more realistic analysis for the far field spreading of the
plume is obtained by assuming that the outfall plume rises to the surface with a surface
dilution predicted by the simple plume formula, with a total volume flux from the whole
diffuser:
                                        µ = QS = 311.2 m3s-1.
In the absence of wind, this may be assumed to spread radially as a surface buoyant
plume (Fischer et al 1979). For a radially spreading surface plume, of radius R we may
write:
                                        dR    ( )12
                                         dt = gsh



                                             179

                                           QSt
and                                    h =
                                           R2
Eliminating the depth h of the buoyant plume between these two equations and then
integrating with respect to t yields:
                                                 1

                                R =   2  gsQS        3          3
                                                 4
                                       3           t 4 = 0.869t 4 ,



where we have used the relationship gs =    g
                                               .
                                            S

It should be noted that while the buoyant plume spreads over the water surface there is
little further dilution. This means that if the dilution in the near field is 1:100 then a
further 1:100 dilution is required for the pathogens to be of concentrations low enough to
be safe for human immersion. Given that a more realistic time for a 1:100 decay is
around 36 hours of sunshine the surface plume will have reached a radius and overflow
depth of
                                       R = 5,930 m; h = 0.364 m ,
respectively. The proposed design the diffuser resides only 1000m from the assumed
fishing grounds and 3000m from the coastline. Hence the decay will be inadequate as
approximately 6000m are required for safe disposal during such tranquil times. Given
that the wind is tranquil for about 25% of the time (Figure 12) this condition is
conservatively likely to prevail for the same percentage of time, namely 25% of the time.


5.0 Modified Outfall Design (New Outfall Design)
It is clear from the above that the proposed outfall design will not produce the necessary
dilution for the nutrient and organic loads and will not be far enough from the shoreline
to ensure the necessary decay of pathogens. However, from 4.3 it is shown that the
general site offshore from Punta Canoas is a suitable site for the location of an outfall. To
demonstrate that placing the diffuser in deeper water will overcome the above problems
with the proposed design we now present a modified design that should meet both the
dilution and decay specifications. This modification should now be tested with a suitable
3D coupled hydrodynamic-pathogen model.

5.1 Near Field Dilution
The near field dilution can be increase by either taking the diffuser into deeper water or
by increasing the number of port. As seen from above the near field dilution with no
cross current presents the most critical case and for this case the far field dilution is most
likely minimal. This means that the design should be such as to provide a 1000 times
dilution in the near field. From above we see that the volume flux in a simple plume is
given by:
                                                 5
                                µ = 0.15 Bi
                                          ( )13 z3,
where the buoyancy flux is given by:



                                            180

                                Bi = 
                                        gQi ,

and the volume flux from port i is given by.

                                Qi =Q   m4s-3 ,
                                     n
where n is the n umber of port in the diffuser.
Combining these leads to an expression for the dilution S:



                                                      1          1

                                                                  z3 ,
                                    Qi = 0.15    g  n   Q
                                                    Q  n 

from which it follows immediately that
                                          1
                                Si ~ z5n2
                                    ( )    3

so that the dilution can be increases by either increasing the number of port or the depth,
but increasing the depth is more effective as the dilution depends on the 5/3 power of the
depth. With the proposed design the dilution was 80 and we require a dilution of 1000,
hence we need an increase of a factor of 12.5. Increasing the depth of the diffuser to say
60m yields an increase in dilution of 6.2 requiring a further dilution by increasing the
number of ports of a factor of 2. This can be achieved by increasing the number of port to
152, implying a considerably longer diffuser (1,520m) and also an outfall length of about
7,000m. Both extensions imply a considerable increase in cost of the diffuser (see Figure
3c for new location).

Figure 16: Detailed Bathymetry showing new alignment of outfall. Length of pipeline
7023m and length of diffuse is 1520m, 152 port. Bathymetry supplied by CIOH and
differs considerable from that shown in the Hazen and Sawyer (1998) document.



5.3 Far Field Decay
The deeper location provides sufficient near field dilution to satisfy the criterion for
nutrients and organic load, but we still require a factor 10 decay or dilution for the
pathogens before the effluent impacts on the assumed fishing boundary 2000m from the
shoreline. This added dilution and decay must therefore take place in a time the surface
plume moves a distance of 5000m.

     1) Tranquil conditions. For this case we may prorate the results obtained in 44.
         from the required 36 hours to 18 hours. Given that the distance travelled under
         these conditions scales with time to the three quarters power this leads to a
         distance of 3,525m, somewhat smaller than the 4000m available.


                                          182

      2) Onshore wind of 5 m/s. From above we see that for this case it takes about 7
          hours for the wind to move the effluent plume a distance of about 5000 m and at
          the same time the surface layer deepens by about 1 m., in other words
          approximately three times the original thickness of the buoyant effluent surface
          plume under tranquil conditions. Hence we would achieve a three fold dilution
          and a three fold decay decrease and when combined with the slight increase in
          the near field dilution due to the cross current we achieve the necessary
          reduction of pathogens before encroaching on the fishing grounds.
      3) Winds greater than 5 ms-1. The cross current initial plume mixing, the added
          vertical mixing and horizontal dispersion would all add to provide a total
          dilution of around 1:10,000.

5.4 Summary
This reviewer agrees with the calculations performed by the proponents as far as the
near field dilution is concerned. However, preliminary calculations suggest that by
neglecting the near surface stratification and by being overly optimistic about the rate
of decay of pathogens, the far field analysis is unreliable. The above results strongly
suggest a failure to comply rate of close to 75% of the time. Feasibility calculations
suggest that a diffuser at Punta Canoas extending 7000m offshore to a depth of 60m
with 152 ports would provide a satisfactory solution with safe disposal of the nutrient,
organic and pathogen load. These feasibility calculations should now be verified with
a fully coupled hydrodynamic-pathogen three dimensional regional model with an
embedded diffuser algorithm. One such model is ELCOM-CAEDYM an open source
model available for download. In order to be applicable the simulations must include
the inflow from the three adjacent rivers, regional winds and open boundary conditions
and be validated against the stratification document in the proponent's documents (see
§2).


6.0 Diapirism Risk
The phenomenon of diapirism was described to the Panel by officers from the Columbian
Geological Survey. and is also discussed in the report by Vernette (2001). An eye witness
account of an eruption near Punta Canoas was related to the Panel with the statement "an
island had formed overnight, which was washed away over a period of weeks". Vernette
(2001) offers no concrete evidence that diaparism vents are located near the proposed
Punta Canoas site and the detailed bathymetry survey obtained from CIOH shows no sign
of submerged mounds in the bathymetry. In the Hazen and Sawyer report there was
mention of a surface manifestation similar to a diapir 350m south west, but no conclusive
results were presented. It is unlikely that such a risk exist, but given the contradictory
evidence AQUACAR should clearly carry out a sonar survey of the proposed and new
outfall trajectory (with a sonar that has some penetration into the sediments) .


7.0 Assessment of Other Locations
It is not clear how the choice of Punta Canoas came about, except for the wish to locate
the outfall away from the clearer water of the Del Rosario National park to the south of


                                            183

Cartagena. I have no argument with the chosen site. Further, many of the earlier drawings
of the outfall option at Punta Canoas show the diffuser extending out to somewhere
around 30 m depth and a number of people interviewed confirmed that the length was
decreased to a depth of 20m in order to reduce costs.

8.0 Conclusions
The Site: The Punta Canoas site has the necessary assimilative capacity to absorb the
impacts of the proposed outfall discharge without loss of any functionality, but not with
the current design. This conclusion is based on the observation that the outfall discharge
is relatively small compared to the load from the Magdalena River for all constituents
except pathogens. The proposed site has the necessary assimilative capacity to absorb
the impact of the outfall without any loss of marine functionality.

8.1.The Proposed Design: The current design neglected to account for the water column
    stratification, the action of an onshore wind and was overly optimistic about the
    pathogen die of rates. Further, the design appeared to completely neglected the recent
    evidence that Coliforms are not a good indicator species for pathogens as a whole and
    dangerous pathogens exist in sewage water that decay much slower. Further, the
    current design totally neglected the need to disperse nutrient and BOD, and indeed
    fails to satisfy the necessary dilution with respect to these pollutants. The proposed
    outfall design is unlikely to achieve safe disposal of the effluent and is estimated
    that it would fail safe pathogen standards nearly 75% of the time.

8.2.New Design: A new design was conceived and involves extending the outfall to 60m
    water depth and increasing the number of port to 152: The new diffuser was provided
    only as an illustration of what would likely be required to render the outfall safe for
    coastal swimmers.

8.3.Other externalities: Given that fishing is an important activity of the locals living
    near the proposed outfall site, it was surprising that Hazen and Sawyer (1998) made
    no mention of the effluent constituency in terms of synthetic organics that are know
    to enter the food chain. No assessment was made of any likely genetic damage to
    fisheries from the introduction of synthetic organics via the outfall.

8.4.Diapirism Risk: There does not appear to be any danger from diapirisms, but the
    geotechnical work, although extensive, did not include a precautionary assessment of
    this risk. A sediment penetrating sonar survey of the outfall alignment was not
    carried out increasing the risk associated with pipe line fracture.
