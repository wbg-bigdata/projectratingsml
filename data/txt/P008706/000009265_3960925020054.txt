PROJECT COMPLETION PEPORT
ROMANIA - TIRES PROJECT
(LOAN 1536-RO)
HIGHLIGHTS
i.        The Tire Project is part of the Bank's efforts to assist Romania
in its industrial development and modernization through the acquisition of
new technology in the production of particular types of tires, specifically
the off-the-road (OTR) and truck tire for equipment vehicles used in
construction, industrial and agricultural sectors, and by closing the
inter-industry linkage gaps through the utilization of domestically
produced raw materials and intermediate products for the manufacture of
products likewise required by other industries (para 2.04-2.08).
ii.       Appraised in July 1977, the Project was the third in the chemical
and fertilizer subsector assisted by the Bank, and it was aimed at
increasing production capacity to meet both domestic requirements as well
as the projected exports. The project components comprised of (i) the
Zalau Plant with an annual capacity of 1 million radial steel belt truck
tires, (ii) the Drobeta Turnu Severin Plant (DTS) with a manufacturing
capacity of 150,000 tractor and 20,000 giant OTR tires, and (iii) common
facilities for reception, handling, mining of raw materials, supply of
compressed air, and other utilities.
iii.      There was no major project scope change against that agreed at
appraisal except the modification in the DTS plant layout in order to avoid
contamination arising from the proximity of the plant's raw material
storage area to a neighboring factory processing agricultural products.
This did not affect the capacity or technology of the DTS component units
and even positively resulted in the vulcanization section, the main steam
consumer, getting closer to the thermal plant built in the vicinity of the
tire plant (para 3.02).
iv.       Project implementation and commissioning suffered a significant
delay mainly due to the (a) difficulty in finding a suitable source for the
giant tire technology and obtaining specialized equipment for the
manufacture of OTR tires; (b) failure of the imported automatic metallic
cord bias-cutting machine to achieve the quality and productivity
performance provided for in the contract which resulted in litigation
before an Arbitration Court in Paris; and (c) delay of more than one year
in the delivery of imported automation components for calendering line and
locally made segmented tire molds (paras 3.14-3.16). Other than these
difficulties, transfer of modern specialized technology has been successful
and operating performance is quite satisfactory. Also the Japanese
Consortium which supplied the main technology equipment package for OTR
tires collaborated %Zth the Romanian agencies, to the Borrower's
satisfaction, and willingly continued their technical assistance in
equipment installation, testing and staff training even after their
contractual obligations had lapsed (para 3.08).



-v -
v.        The actual total cost required for the project was
US$283.5 million, which is 12.6% higher than the appraisal estimate of
US$251.7 million. Expressed in local currency, however, the total actual
cost would be 6.1% below appraisal due to changes in exchange rate. Total
financing was US$312.9 million or 21.2% higher than the appraisal estimate
of US$258.1 million due to longer implementation period which resulted in
much higher interest during construction (para 3.17-3.18).
vi.       The production performance of the Zalau Plant lagged behind
schedule reaching only 10% in 1982 and 16% in 1983 due to failure to obtain
the required automation components which was later overcome, and the poor
performance of a major piece of equipment. On the other hand, the DTS
facilities reached full capacity level operation in 1984 and erection was
completed in the fourth quarter of 1985 (para 4.01-4.02).
vii.      Tire consumption lags five years behind the appraisal estimate
mainly due to the slump in the Romanian economy and the general worldwide
economic slowdown which affected both domestic sales and exports. Since
the time of appraisal, international market prices for tires have decreased
by about 35%. Cost of many materials needed for tire manufacture also
deteriorated and resulting project ERR is 8.2% compared to 14%-30%
projected at appraisal (para 6.03).
viii.     Overall, despite the delays in implementation and start up, the
transfer of technology in this project has been successful, and the
objective of increased production capacity to meet the needs of the
industry and other economic sectors has been achieved.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - TIRES
(LOAN 1536-RO)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Tires Project is part of che overall Romanian plan for the
development of the country's industry by closing inter-industry linkage
gaps:. in this case specifically through the utilization of domestically
produced synthetic rubbers, carbon black and other intermediate products to
produce a product incorporated into truck, tractor and heavy-duty vehicles
also produced in Romania and destined for export or for other economic
sectors, mainly agriculture, mining, transportation and construction. The
Tires Project was the third project in the chemical and fertilizer
subsector assisted by the Bank in Romania and it was aimed at meeting
growing domestic needs as well as projected exports.
1.02      The Project has been ptepared and implemented undet the following
organizations: Ministry of Chemical Industries (MCI), Industrial Central
for Rubber and Plastics Processing (the Central), Process Engineering and
Design Institute for Chemical Industries (IITPIC) and the Tire Enterprises
of Zalau and Drobeta-Turnu Severin.
-I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Loan Approval
2.01      After discussions between Romanian authorities and Bank
representatives, a project identification mission of the Industry
Department I/ visited Romania in April/May 1976 and selected this and two
other projects then being planned in the chemical subsector as being
suitable for Bank consideration. The Project was appraised in July 1977,
and the corresponding Staff Appraisal Report was issued on February 23,
1978.
2.02      The Process Engineering and Design Institute for Chemical
Industries (IIPTIC),. under the Ministry of Chemical Industries, was
responsible for general project design, technical selection of tire
manufacturing processes, equipment specifications and site locations.
Based on information supplied by the Central, process licensors, and
foreign and domestic equipment suppliers, IITPIC was also in charge of
civil works and detailed engineering designs.
B. Project Objectives and Description
2.03      The Project's main objective was to increase the productive
capacity of Romanian tires industry so that the domestic demand for tires
1/   At the time of appraisal, the Industry Department was called the
Industrial Projects Department.



-2-
could be fully met leaving a surplus for exports, including convertible
currency exports. In particular, the Project was intended to cover the
neede of giant off-the-road (OTR) tires for the construction and mining
industries, including tires required for heavy-duty vehicles manufactured
in Romania for export.
2.04      The project comprised:
(a) The Zalau Plant with an annual capacity of 1 million radial steel
belt truck tires;
(b) The Drobeta-Turnu Severin (OTS) Plant comprising:
(i) a section for the manufacture of up to 150,000 tractor
tires;
(ii) a section for 20,000 OTR tires; and
(hii)  common facilities for the reception, handling and mixing of
raw materials, and for the supply of compressed air and
other utilities.
2.05      The Zalau Plant is located in the norttiwestern area of the
country, Salaj County, an area which at the time of the appraisal was
relatively industrially underdeveloped. The Drobeta-Turnu Severin plant is
located on the Danube River, in the Mehedinti County, in the country's
soathwestern region. The two plants are directly linked to the Romanian
highway and railroad networks and the Drobeta-Turnu Severin plant is also
connected to the Danube river transport system, which makes it easier to
procure raw materials and market the production.
2.06      The manufacturing processes used to produce truck tires in the
Zalau tires enterprise and tractor tires in the DTS enterprise are Romanian
processes adapted from foreign suppliers of technology or developed by the
Research Institute for Rubber and Plastice Processing. There was, however,
no modern technology available in the country for the manufacture of OTR
tires and,. therefore, within the general objectives of the Project, an
important specific target was the introduction of up-to-date technology
through a major technology/equipment package.
2.07      Natural robber, making up about 12% of the truck tires and 24% of
the OTR tires by weight, is imported. Other raw materials - mainly
synthetic rubber, carbon black and steel and textiles required for the
production of tires are mostly of local origin. Only a very small volume
of vulcanizing chemicals must be imported. (Bead wire, which had been
imported at appraisal time, is now produced locally.) The heat (steam and
hot water) and electric power at Zalau and Drobeta-Turnu Severin are
supplied from thermal power plants built for this and other industries in
the same area and from electric substations receiving power from the
national electric grid. Labor was available at both sites but training for
skilled operators was needed (para 3.07).

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Priett-OblIctives
3.01      The main objectives - introduction of new technology for the
manufacture of giant tires and increased production of tires for
industrial, agricultural and construction uses - have been attained and the
training of staff for the new processes has been successful (para 7.02)
B. Project Scope Changes
3.02      There have been no important changes in project scope compared
with that agreed upon during appraisal, except that the DTS plant layout
was modified in 1979 by rearranging its component units within the site
(but not affecting its capacity and technology). The Bank indicated in May
1980 that it had no objection to this change. The main reason for the
change was to avoid the risk of contamination arising from the proximity of
the plant's raw material storage area to a neighboring factory processing
agrtcultural products. The new layout required modifications in the
disposition of the access road and the railway spur. A positive result of
the change was that the main consumer of steam - the vulcanization section
- was placed nearer to the thermal plant being built in the vicinity of the
tire plant.
C. Proiect Management
3.03      Project implementation followed normal practice in Romania:  the
Central had the general responsibility for tire production in Romania and
for planning new tire production capacities. The Zalau and Drobeta-Turnu
Severin Enterprises, established in November 1977 and April 1978,
respectively, acted as project managers. The implementation of the Project
was a complex undertaking, in which, as described in the following
paragraphs, several other Romanian agencies participated.
3.04      In addition to its role in general project design, IITPIC was
entrusted with the selection of foreign technology and main equipment
specifications, site layout, detailed engineering, and plans for the civil
works and erection of the Project units. Based on the designs and
specifications developed by IITPIC, IntdustrialExporttmport (another
Government agency) was in charge of all foreign procurement (including
technology) using the services of the Central and the Research Institute
for Rubber and Plastics Processing as technical consultants. Romanian
equipment was procured directly by the user enterprises assisted
techntcally by IITPIC.
3.05      The construction and erection works were the responsibility of
the General Enterprises for Industrial Construction of Cluj-Napoca and
Craiova which are specialized enterprises under the Minlstry of Industrial
Constructions. During project implementation, Romanian and foreign
companies supplying technical know-how and major equipment have
participated closely in checking the correct erection of equipment and



-4-
plant commissioning. The day-to-day coordination of the implementation
work has been handled by the Enterprises, under the Central, while overall
supervision and liaison with other ministries and central bodies has been
carried out by the Ministry of Chemical Industries.
D. Employment and Training
3.06      When fully operational, total employment at Zalau will be 2,515
workers (there are 1,940 workers at present) and 1,470 workers at
Drobeta-Turnu Severin (960 are employed at present). These figures
compare with the appraisal estimates of 2,515 and 1,800 workers at Zalau
and Drobeta-Turnu Severin, respectively. At present, project employment is
comprised of 3% managerial and higher-level technical personnel, 8%
technical and supervisory staff, 82% skilled labor and the balance of 7%
unskilled labor. The staff for these two new enterprises have been largely
drawn from other enterprises operating under the same Central.
3.07      On-the-job training was mainly provided by the Victoria-Floresti
and Danubiana-Bucharest enterprises, supplemented by training provided by
the suppliers of technology and major equipment (17 workers, technicians
and engineers were trained in Japan by Mitsubishi/Yokohama, the suppliers
of the main equipment/technology procurement package). Intermediate level
technically trained personnel were also recruited locally at Zalau and
Drobeta-Turnu Severin.
E. Use of Suppliers' Personnel
3.08      As previously mentioned, the Central, IITPIC and the DTS and
Zalau Enterprises had the responsibility for project design and
implementation and no foreign consultants or engineering firms were
required. Basic data and know-how for the units involved in the
manufacturing of OTR tires were supplied by Mitsubishi Co. in cooperation
with Yokohama Rubber Co. (Japan). During the implementation of the
Project, staff from the licensor of OTR tire technology and the suppliers
of specialized equipmnnt provided technical assistance. Staff from the
Mitsubishi and Yokohama companies were particularly useful in this
undertaking because of their willingness to continue their assistance in
equipment erection, tests running and training of staff, even after their
contractual obligations had lapsed.
F. Equipment Procurement
3.09      For goods and services financed by the Bank, ICB procedures were
followed except for small items (costing less than US$100,000) for a total
value of US$2.3 million. Potential suppliers were prequalified following
procedures acceptable to the Bank, taking into account the technical
capacity and past record of interested firms. At least two or three
foreign firms were prequalified for each bid package and Bank procedures
were adhered to in all cases. As mentioned above, the Enterprises,
technically assisted by IITPIC, handled procurement of goods and services
not financed by the Bank and coordinated all procurement activities,
including the contracting of civil works and plant erection.



-5-
3.10      The procurement of the technologylequipment package for giant
(OTR) tires presented difficulties and resulted in the delayed
implementation of the project because of the limited number of interested
qualified suppliers and the complex technical aspects that needed to be
clarified before the formal bidding process could be started. From May
1977 until October 1978 proposals were repeatedly and unsuccessfully
requested from the main potential suppliers of OTR technology in the USA,
England, Japan, France, Italy and Federal Republic of Germany and the
Investment Bank requested the Bank's assistance in obtaining responses from
these firms. Two companies agreed to present proposals for the major OTR
technology/equipment package following ICB procedures. Only one of these
proposals, submitted by Mitsubishi Co. (Japan) - which had Yokohama Rubber
Co. as a technical partner - was a complete technical and commercial tender
fully responsive to the bid invitation documents. Consequently, the Bank
agreed on the decision to award the contract to this company. This
contract was signed in September 1980, 24 months later than expected at the
time of project appraisal.
3.11      Out of the total amount of the loan, US$54,9 million (64.6%) were
used to finance imported goods and services.  Among foreign suppliers, the
most important ones were from Japan, France, US and Italy (Annex 3-1).  All
Bank-financed domestic procurement was based on international bidding
procedures. In the Appraisal Report it was anticipated that 32.9% of the
total value of the Bank Loan would be used to import technology and
equipment required to manufacture OTR tires (Category I), 46.7% to import
other equipment and materials (Categories II and III) and 20.4% of the loan
to procure equipment through ICB with participation of Romanian suppliers
(Category IV). The actual cost of the OTR equipment and technology and
that of other goods is shown in the following table.

3.12      Because of differences between the Romanian and Bank procurement
procedures and the apparent desire of the Romanian agencies to minimize
actual imports (para 7.04), difficulties were encountered in the



-6-
procurement of two bid packages. One was for the acquisition of 276 truck
tire and 114 tractor tire curing molds. Invitations to bid were sent to 11
prospective suppliers. Nine firms responded in accordance with the tender
specifications for both types of molds but two were for only part of the
bid package. The Borrower awarded the tender to Industrial Export Import.
No issues emerged in the award decision for truck tire molds but one
tractor tire mold manufacturer complained about the bidding procedure.
After exhaustive investigation of the organization and results of this bid,
the Bank concluded that the contestant of the bid award had not fully
complied with the specifications contained in the tender documents but at
the same time it warned the Romanian agencies that the procedures followed
in this case suffered from some procedural mistakes, which did not,
however, warrant a judgement of misprocurement. The other case involved
the procurement of nine packages for curing presses, tire building
machines, calenders, and other equipment. A prequalified list of 13
possible vendors for all these packages was approved by the Bank and
invitations to bid were sent to 7 or 8 suppliers by IndustrialExportImport
for each package separately, except three packages for which three or four
companies were invited for each of them. The Bank indicated that the list
of 13 vendors had been approved for all the packages and remarked that the
time allowed by the bid organizers was insufficient to prepare and present
the bids; in August 1982 discussions were held in Bucharest between the
Investment Bank and a Bank mission and a decision was reached to rebid
eight of the nine packages. On this occasion, the Bank representatives
approved a new list of suppliers who were invited to rebid for each
separate package. For six of.the packages, the approved list-of vendors
comprised only foreign firms.
G. Ecology
3.13      The DTS and Zalau Enterprises have been built following Romanian
standards related to environmental protection and are equivalent to those
used in other industrialized countries. In particular, storage, bag
opening and transport of carbon black (which accounts for about 25% of the
materials used in the manufacture of tires) are carried out mechanically in
specially isolated equipment. The Enterprises are also equipped with local
filtering and ventilation systems that maintain suspended pollutants within
limits accepted by international standards. Safety devices are installed
throughout the plants' facilities to prevent accidents. Treatment stations
are also provided' for waste water effluents.
H. Implementation Schedule
3.14      The actual schedule of project implementation schedule is
compared to that at the time of appraisal in Annex 3-2. The commissioning
of the Zalau plant took place in December 1981 (a 23-month delay), the DTS
tractor tire line in October 1983 (a 35-month delay) and the DTS giant
(OTR) line in October 1985 (a 57-month delay). The commissioning was,
however, a lengthy process in each case, with parts of the plants being
started before the dates given above. Actual truck tire production at
Zalau began in August 1981 and, at DTS, tractor tires were produced since



-7-
May 1983. A limited number of OTR tires was also produced at DTS since
August 1985.
3.15      The main reasons for the delay in the operation of some
facilities at full capacity and overall implementation and commissioning of
the Project were the difficulty in finding a suitable source of technology
and specialized equipment for the manufacture of OTR tires (para 3.10)
which took place more than two years behind schedule, and the desire to
obtain satisfactory technical information and performance guarantees. The
startup of the Zalau Plant was delayed 18 months while that of
Drobeta-Turnu-Severin for the tractor and giant tires was 27 to 40 months.
3.16      Other major factors that created severe problems in
implementation and commissioning were:
(a) the failure of the imported automatic metallic cord bias-cutting
machine to operate at rated capacity and achieve the quality and
productivity performance provided for in the contract which led
to contentious procedures brought before an Arbitration Court in
Paris; and
(b) delay of more than one year in the (i) delivery of two sets of
automation components for the calendering line which were never
operated satisfactorily and had to be replaced by locally made
components; and (ii) the segmented tire molds from local and
foreign sources.
Delays in designing some common sections for the tractor and giant tire
plant leading to delays in construction-erection works and late deliveries
by some domestic suppliers of equipment made for the first time in Romania
on which they had limited experience were viewed as contributing factors,
but of lesser impact, to delays in Project implementation and
commissioning.
*. Capital Costs, Financing and Loan Disbursement
3.17     Capital costs and financing required for the Zalau and DTS project
components are shown in Annexes 3-3 and 3-4 and summarized in the table
next page. Total actual cost of the Project is US$283.5 million
equivalent, 12.6% higher than at the time of appraisal. If the costs are
expressed in local currency, however, total actual cost would be 6.1% below
the appraisal estimate. Both figures are misleading because they are
distorted by sudden changes in the exchange rate during the period of
project implementation. More in agreement with reality is the observation
that local currency costs, expressed in Lei, increased by 0.9% 2/ while
2/   Instead of the 21.5% increase registered in US$ equivalent, which
results from the appreciation of the Lei from Lei 20 at the time of
appraisal to an average of Lei 16.7 to the US$ during Project
implementation.

foreign exchange cots,' expressed in US$ equivalent, decreased by 3.8% so
that the weighted average would result in an underrun of 1.1%.

3.18     Total financing required for the Project expressed ia US$
equivalent is 21.2Z higher than the appraisal estimate.  This is much
higher than the overrun in project cost (12.6%) because the longer actual
implementation period (than originally planned) resulted in much higher
charges for interest during construction as compared to those shown in the
Appraisal Repert. Total financing expressed in Lei, on the other hand,
would be 2.9% lower than at appraisal but this is not a valid conclusion
since most of the interest charges were incurred in foreign currency
(US$22.00 million actual vs. US$6.4 million appraisal estimate).
3.19     Annual capital cost expenditures in Lei and in current and
constant 1984 US$ are shown in Annex 3-5.  The closing date of the Bank
loan was initially set for December 31, 1981, but, in consideration of the
difficulties encountered in the procurement of the specialized OTR
technology/equipment package, it was extended to June 30, 1984. The actual
investment curve therefore differs considerably from the estimated curve



-9-
and it shows peaks in 1980/81 for the Zalau plant and in 1982/83 for the
DT$ plant.  The estimated and actual Loan disbursement schedules are shown
in- Annex 3-6.
IV. -OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production Build-up
4.01      As a result of the delays in project implementation (para 3.14),
production has also lagged behind schedule. The Zalau plant, after
commissioning at the end of 1981, was able to reach only 10% of capacity in
1982 and 16? in 1983, mainly because of the failure to obtain the required
automation components (para 3.16). In 1984 this difficulty was overcome
but the deficient performance of the metallic cord bias-cutting machines
has also made it impossible for the Zalau plant to attain its design
capacity.
4.02      At Drobeta-Turnu Severin plant the mixing section and the tractor
tire facilities were started at the end of 1983 and, in 1984, ip was able
to reach full capacity level operation (and 532 capacity as an average for
the year). Erection work for the OTR tire section continued during 1984 -
71 tires were made that year - and erection was completed in the fourth
quarter of 1985. Actual OTR tire production in 1985 has been about 5,000
tires and projected figures for the following years are shown in the table
below.

B.  Tire Market Development
4.03      Tire production and domestic consumption are coordinated at a
centralized level. Overall programs - as well as projects to increase
production - are submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval, and
the attainment of the approved levels of production are the responsibility
of t,he Central which coordinates the main tire production and distribution
plans. Exports are handled through Danubiana Foreign Trade Co. As shown
in the table below, the development of the tire market is lagging more than
five years behind the appraisal estimates mainly due to the slump in the
Romanian economy as well as the world-wide slowdown, which has affected
direct exports as well as internal sales for original equipment
incorporated in exported vehicles. The development of more extensive tire
retreading practices has also influenced the sale of new tires.

4.05      The main consumers of truck tires are the COMECON countries,
including Romania. The general slowdown of the economy - in Romania and
worldwide - has led to a slower growth of the market than forecast at the
time of appraisal. The main-destination of exports is given in table
below. Penetration of the Western economy markets was not as successful as
projected in the appraisal report: COMECON countries absorbed 30Z of
Romanian exports by volume in 1985 instead of the projected 24% at the time
of appraisal.

B. Financial Analysis
5.04      Financial results and projections through year 2000 are shown in
Annexes 5-4 and 5-5. They are based on actual data for 1984 and the
production estimates until year 2000 and prices now in force; these new
prices are kept constant after 1985. On the basis of the cost and benefit
streams shown in Annex 5-6, the financial rate of return is found to be
10.1% for the Project as a whole compared to the 13.4% estimate at
appraisal.  The financial rate of return for the two subprojects is
practically the same. Financial rates of return under the Romanian pricing
and foreign exchange systems are not, however, significant in defining a
project's success (or lack of it).

VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      International prices for tractor and OTR tires are at present
somewhat depressed because of the acutely depressed prices for mining
products and some agricultural crops throughout the world. During
appraisal, prices for a range of tire sizes and constructions were
analyzed; the following table shows the appraisal estimates and the present
(much lower) international price projections made for the same
representative sample:
Romania - Tires Project
International Prices
(in 1984 US$)
Appraisal Report
Estimates
Low       High      Actual
Truck Tires (US$/Set)          196.00    241.00     145.00
Tractor Tires (US$/kg)           2.56      3.77       2.08
OTR (US$/kg)                     3.32      4.37       2.48
As it can be seen, prices for the project products have in real terms
deteriorated by about 35%.
*6.02      As shown in Annex 6-1, for the calculation of the economic rate
of return (ERR), financial prices in 1984 US$ for natural and synthetic
rubber and metal and textile cord have been reduced by 30% according to
present trends in the international markets. JQt*er material costs have
been adjusted down by 10%. The costs of electric power and steam shown in
the IB's report have also been aligned with international prices. Fixed
costs have been maintained in the ERR calculations at the level used in the
financial analysis.
6.03      Consumption of inputs per unit produced was estimated
conservatively during appraisal; actual figures already attained have been
used for the present calculations of the ERR. The economic rate of return
calculated on the basis of the cost and benefit streams (Annex 6-2)
resulting from the above is 8.2% compared to the range of 14-30X estimated
during appraisal. For the Zalau and DTS subprojects,. the rates of return
are 7.9% and 8.8%, respectively. The lower rate calculated at present is
due mainly to the lower expected market prices for tires and the observed
delays in completion of the OTR facilities. Sensitivity analyses show that
if the present exchange rate were shadow priced at Lei 22 to the US$,
operating cost expressed in US$ would be reduced by about 18.4% and the
Project's ERR would be 12.5% and that a 10% increase or drop in operating
costs would reduce or increase the Project's ERR by 2.9 or 2.5 points,
respectively, while an average overall increase in product prices of 20%
would result in an ERR within the range shown in the Appraisal Report.

VII. BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
A. Bank Role
7.01      During the mid-1970s, the Project formed part of a broad-based
effort on the part of the Bank to assist Romania in improvioig the
performance of its industrial sector. Other projects selected included
those in the fertilizer, steel, chemicals, fibers, and mechanical
subsectors. This Project was selected because it included the acquisition
of highly specialized modern technology for the manufacture of giant (OTR)
tires, and was based on the substitution of imports and promotion of
exports of a key industrial product.
7.02      The Bank actively supported the Romanian agencies in defining the
main technology and equipment package, the preparatory work for competitive
bidding for that package, and the formulation of satisfactory performance
guarantees. The Bank also assisted in the procurement of other equipment
and supplies thus helping in obtaining a reasonably low total project
cost. The transfer of modern technology has been very substantial and has
been attained not only through the procurement of imported equipment and
licensing but also through a learning process in the domestic machinery
building industry, which supplied a significant part of the specialized
equtpment needed (para 7.04).
B.  Lessons Learned
7.03      The experience gained in this Project confirms lessons learned in
previous Romanian projects. Project implementation was reasonably
successful despite delays ranging between 23 and 57 months for the
different project components. Early supervision proved beneficial in
completing all arrangements for proper engineering and technology
acquisition, and in developing adequate procurement procedures. Guidance
provided to the project sponsor in the early stages led to a better
understanding of the Bank's procedures and thus to more efficient-project
implementation but there were: (i) unavoidable delays in obtaining the
collaboration of the few firms capable of supplying up-to-date technology
and equipment for the manufacture of OTR tires; and (ii) delays in the
acquisition of the needed technical information and know-how by local
manufacturers of specialized machinery. This latter issue has been
observed in a number of other projects in Romania.
7.04      A long time was required to negotiate the supply of the main
equipment and technology package for the manufacture of giant (OTR) tires.
The aims of the extended negotiations were to obtain a price consistent
with estimated costs, obtain maximum information on technology ana to
minimize the foreign content of the package (para 3.15). Some of the
implementation delays were caused by the inexperience of Romanian firms in
supplying engineering services and equipment based on a new technology but
there were also significant delays associated to the deficient performance
of a few foreign suppliers. The transfer of technology achieved in this
project is deemed successful but at the cost of a delayed start-up. The
trade-offs between higher immediate transfer or adaptation of foreign
technology and the risk of implementation delays should be explicitly
evaluated during preparation for projects of this type.

Mr.Otto Malies
Division Chief
P&%Project Completion Report on the Tires Project,
Loan 1536-RO
Purtherto your December 4,1986 latter,would like to lot you
know we generally agree to the draft of the above mentioned POR
prepared by the Industry Department in the World Bank.
With reference to the main causes determining delays in the
implementation of the Project and commissioning of the facilities,
we would like to point out that these have beon summarized in the
draft of the POR propared by the Investment Bank(under Chapter III,
items 3.16 and 3.17) and extensively discussod with the Bank missJon
in February 1986.
We consider that delayed delivery of some items by local
suppliers could not be viewed as one of major causes leading to
delays in the Project implementation,as shown in the Bank's POR
(under Highli.hts,item ii and Chapter III,items 3.15 and 3.16),
since such oases occured only for limited number of equipment not
entailing delays in the commissioning of the facilities,
The main causo,which shoul4 be more evideatly stressed in
the PCR and whioh,to our regret created severe problems in the
implementation and commissioning of the ProJeot and the operation
of some facilities at full cspecity,ase well,ws besides the
difficulties in selecting the giant OTR tires suppliers of equipmet
and tochnology,the delivery with defaults of metallic cord outting
machines                                   failing to aohieve the
quality and produotivity performances provided for in the contract,
and also the more than one year delay in supplying the two sets of
automation equipment for coalenderiag line
and the segments sets for the tire molds
