I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Romania has requested a Bank loan of US$85 mil-
lion equivalent for the construction of two tire plants at Zalau and Turnu
Severin (the Project), 1/ about 450 km northwest and 350 km west of Bucharest,
respectively (Map IBRD 13109). The Zalau plant will produce about one million
all steel radial truck tires 2/ per year, of which half will be destined for
the export market mainly to other COMECON countries. The plant at Turnu
Severin will produce about 150,000 tractor tires and 20,000 giant or off-the-
road (OTR) tires per year mostly for the domestic market. Except for the OTR
tires, technology will be based on know-how previously purchased and adapted
to Romanian conditions. Preliminary work for the implementation of the
Project has begun, and commissioning is expected to take place in early 1980
for the Zalau and early 1981 for the Turnu Severin sub-project.
1.02      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at lei 5,164
million (US$258 million), including lei 1,897 million (US$94.8 million) in
foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would therefore provide 33% of
the total and 90% of the foreign exchange financing needs. The Government
will provide the remainder of the funds required. The Zalau sub-project was
approved in March 1977 and funds allocated by a decision of the Council of
Ministers. For the Turnu Severin sub-project, approval is expected in mid
1978.
1.03      The Project was first identified by a Bank mission to Romania
in May 1976, which, from a list of nine industrial projects, gave this
project, together with two others, priority for Bank support. The Project
was appraised in July 1977 by a mission consisting of Messrs. N. Petry
(Chief) and A. Tarnawiecki of the Industrial Projects Department. In
addition, two consultants were used to provide information on the export
markets for Romanian tires and to review specific technical aspects of the
Project.
II. THE TIRE INDUSTRY AND THE BORROWER
A.   Ministry of Chemical Industries
2.01      In Romania, manufacturing of tires comes under the Ministry of
Chemical Industries. The organizational structure of the chemical industry
has the same three step hierarchy as all industrial sectors in Romania,
comprising the technical ministry, the industrial central and the enter-
prise. The Ministry is responsible for the planning and performance of
its sector for which it also approves proposed investments for subsequent
submission to the Council of State, the highest authority for final

been changed to Drobeta-Turnu Severin.
2/   A glossary of the main technical terms used in this report is given
in Annex .



approval. The industrial central directs the operations of all enterprises
in its particular sub-branch of the economy (e.g., Central for Cotton Pro-
ducts, Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics), allocates production programs
and coordinates purchase of raw materials and domestic sales. Also under
the Ministry of Chemical Industries are the following agencies: The Tech-
nological Engineering and Design Institute for Chemical Industry (IITPIC),
the Import Agency for Chemical Equipment and Technology (ROMCHIM) and
Danubiana Export Import (DANUBEXIM), the agency for the exportation of
many chemical products, including tires.
2.02      The chemical industry has been one of Romania's most dynamic
sectors.  Since 1950, it has attained an average growth of 21% a year and
ranks now in third place with a share of about 12% of total industrial
output, behind the machine building and metal working industries (31%) and
the food industries (13%). It absorbed about 13% of total industrial
investment and employed 7% of the industrial labor force in 1976.

The development strategy for the chemical industry has been largely designed
to increase the value added to the country's petroleum and methane gas re-
sources. Accordingly, the fastest growth has occurred in fertilizers,
plastics and synthetic rubber and fibers. Long-term plans continue to



- 3 -
attribute a high priority to petrochemicals which are expected to account
for three-fourths of the chemical industry output by 1990, against about
one-half today.
2.03      The industry is largely concentrated in the center and the south
of the country, where large refinery and petrochemical complexes have been
developed around Ploesti and Pitesti to produce a broad range of refinery
products, petrochemical intermediates and end-products. The Government is
making an effort to locate downstream industries, such as fertilizers, tires
and synthetic fibers, away from these traditional industrial centers, partly
to promote a more balanced regional development, thus also avoiding industrial
congestion, and partly because of greater availability of labor and accomo-
dations.
B.   Development of the Tire Industry
2.04      Production of tires in Romania started in 1939 when Goodrich (USA)
established a private tire manufacturing company at Victoria (Floresti, 22 km
northwest of Ploesti) with a capacity of about 100,000 tires per year. In
1950, the USSR, which exported trucks and tractors to Romania at that time,
also supplied technology for the manufacturing of truck and tractor tires.
Up to 1960, tire production increased only slowly, but considerable advances
were made in developing purchased know-how and tire technology and adapting
it to domestically available raw materials.
2.05      By 1962, production capacity was increased by about one millicn
tires, when the plant at Victoria was expanded and a new plant was commis-
sioned at Danubiana (on the outskirts of Bucharest). The increased produc-
tion capacity was for diagonal passenger car, truck and tractor tires using
Romanian technology and the equipment was supplied by an English consortium
of machine manufacturers. Dunlop (UK) was used as consultant to ensure
that the British equipment was compatible with Romanian technology.
2.06      Further expansions of the Danubiana and Victoria plants took
place between 1967 and 1970 increasing the country's production capacity
to about 2.4 million tires per year. This expansion was directed towards
the introduction of radial passenger car and tractor tires in all textile
and textile/steel construction with the new radial technology supplied by
Pirelli (Italy). The equipment was procured through a British and German
consortium with some of the process equipment being supplied by Pirelli.
2.07      The most recent major expansion took place in 1973-75 at the
Victoria plant by adding facilities with an annual capacity of one million
passenger car and truck tires in textile/steel and all steel radial construc-
tion. The technology for this expansion was supplied by General Tire
International (GTI, USA), which also acted as the general supplier for a
large portion of the equipment and machinery. In 1977, Romanian tire pro-
duction capacity was about 5 million tires, and production is estimated to
have reached about 4.7 million tires.

2.08      Besides the two new plants included in the Project, Romania is
planning three major investments to increase tire production capacity. The
plant at Danubiana is presently being expanded to increase tractor tire
production by 400,000 per year. Commissioning is expected at the end of
1978. At Victoria, expansion is planned in various stages mainly for
passenger car tires. By 1981, an additional 1.5 million passenger car
tires are expected to be produced there. Finally, a joint venture between
Romania and Citroen (France) which is to set up production facilities for
150,000 passenger cars per year (to be expanded to 300,000 cars before 1985),
will require additional quantities of passenger car tires, and a new plant
at Caracal is planned with a capacity of 2 million car tires annually.
Production of this plant is scheduled to start in 1981.
2.09      The table on the following page gives a breakdown of tire capacity
and production for the past aLs well as the future indicating that production
is expected to increase to 13.5 million tires by 1985, which is a nearly
threefold increase of the 1977 production level of 4.7 million. The market
implications of this are discussed in Chapter III.
2.10      At present, Romania has the know-how and technology for passenger
car, truck and tractor tires in diagonal and radial construction, but still
lacks the technology for OTR tires. The Project is designed to assist
Romania in closing this gap.
2.11      Over the last 30 years, Romania has systematically developed indi-
genous capability for supplying nearly all of the raw materials required
for the tire industry. Of the more important inputs, only natural rubber
and wire tire cord are imported, but a plant started producing the latter
in mid-1977 to supply about 50% of domestic requirements. Expansions of
this plant are scheduled to provide for all of the domestic requirements
by 1985. Synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabric cord and most chemicals
are produced in Romania, and tire technology has been adapted where necessary
to the specifications of domestic materials.

1/  Expansions of Zalau and Turnu Severin are planned to be commissioned not later than 1983.  Second
stage of Zalau is part of Techno-Economic Study for Zalau I and has been approved in principle.
Remaining production capacity is mostly for passenger car tires, but project has not yet been
identified.

2.12      The table on the folLowing page gives an overview of the present and
future raw material requirements and also compares these to Romania's overall
production capacity. Location of the major raw material plants is also noted
on Map IBRD 13109. Compared to Western Europe or North America, the use of
rayon still accounts for a large share of fiber consumption, while polyester
and glass fibers have not yet been introduced. This is explained by the
desire of the Government to make full use of the country's rayon production
capacity and by the fact that production capacity for nylon, polyester and
glass fibers is not sufficient to also cover tire manufacturing. It is the
intention of the Government to increase the share of these fibers, but so
far concrete steps have only been taken for the expansion of nylon tire cord
capacity.
2.13      With well-developed technology and a raw material base quite
independent of imports, the future development of the tire sector is geared
to keeping Romanian know-how up to date and to developing a machine building
industry to substitute for imported equipment and machinery in order to save
foreign exchange and to make the tire industry a more effective generator of
foreign exchange. Considerable experience has been gathered by the Romanians
in maintaining equipment imported from many different countries, including the
manufacturing of spare parts and the complete rebuilding of worn-out machinery.
Over the last two years, designs were developed for the less sophisticated
equipment for which a considerable amount of expertise has been acquired from
maintaining and rebuilding such equipment. Consequently, an intensive equip-
ment manufacturing program is now under way. The project will receive a
significant portion of the equipment from this program (para 4.10).
C.  Organization of the Tire Industry
2.14      CIPCMP, the Central responsible for the existing and future tire
production, has existed in its present form since 1973. A total of 11
existing enterprises and 10 new, projects are presently under the responsi-
bility of the Central. Two existing enterprises are for tires, four are
for technical rubber goods (hoses, V-belts, etc.) and five are for plastic
products (pipes, tubes, fillers, bags, etc.). A complete list of the ex-
isting and firmly planned enterprises of the Central is given in Annex 2-1.
Total employment within the Central in mid-1977 was 28,500. The organiza-
tion chart of CIPCMP is given in Annex 2-2 which shows, as in most industrial
centrals, four functional departments (production, technological, commercial,
financial) and a number of staff departments, including personnel, which are
also directly under the General Manager. The Central's senior staff also
acts in responsible positions in one of the enterprises, in this case in
Danubiana, and the Central provides technical assistance to all its enter-
prises.
2.15      For the Project, two new enterprises are required, one for the
Zalau sub-project, which was established in March 1977, and one for the
Turnu Severin sub-project, which is expected to be established by mid-1978.
Disbursement of the Bank loan on account of the Turnu-Severin sub-project will
be limited to US$6 million until the enterprise is established; CIPCMP will
assume all obligations of the new enterprise until the latter is established.
A pro-forma organization chart identical for the two enterprises is shown in
Annex 2-3.

2.16      Decision making power at the enterprise level formally belongs to the
enterprises' General Assembly which includes all the workers and which normally
meets twice a year. A Working People's Executive Committee, chaired by the
enterprise's General Manager and consisting of elected workers' representatives
and some members of the management, is to be in charge of operation. The
General and Technical Managers of the enterprises will be responsible for
implementing the decisions of the Executive Committee. This type of organiza-
tion has worked satisfactorily in the day-to-day operations of other Romanian
chemical plants known to the Bank.
D.  Financial Situation and Prospects of the Central
2.17      The Central is the locus for consolidation of the financial results
of the individual enterprises, the overall surplus or deficit of the Central
then being absorbed within the Ministry's accounts and eventually emerging
in the State budget. As mentioned in previous Bank appraisal reports on
Romania, financial analyses and projections as generally applied by the Bank
to evaluate the performance and prospects of industrial enterprises are of
limited value in the Romanian system. However, to illustrate the scope
of operations under present price and cost relationships, actual and projected
financial statements for CIPCMP are shown in Annex 2-4 and summarized below.

The data indicates that the Central's profitability is satisfactory, although
the latter reflects not only efficient operations but also Romanian pricing
policies. In 1976, about 25% of the Central's sales value was from tires.
This percentage is expected to increase to 35% by 1980.
E.   The Romanian Financial System and the Borrower
2.18      The State determines all prices, and annual financial plans are
made by the enterprises and the industrial centrals so as to meet targets
contained in the Five Year and Annual Plans. Since the primary responsi-
bility of an enterprise is to meet established physical targets and inputs
and outputs are calculated at fixed prices, financial profitability for an
enterprise--as related to capital employed and output--is established under



the direction of the central, and the efficiency of an enterprise's manage-
ment is measured by the achievement of the assigned production and profit-
ability targets. There has been a historical tendency for prices to remain
stable over long periods of time. This implies not only that there is lack
of close correlation with shifting supply and demand relations but also that
relationships between costs and prices become distorted as industry expands
and technology and productivity improve. To remedy these distortions, periodic
price resettings are undertaken for the whole economy, each sector being re-
viewed separately. The last such price resetting (since 1963) was during
1974-76 and the present internal prices for chemicals--which are now roughly
in line with international prices--are expected to be in force at least
through the end of the current Five Year Plan period (1980).
2.19      The Investment Bank (the Borrower) administers and controls all
investment funds of the State budget (except for agriculture and food pro-
cessing) and acts as the channel for all sources of major domestic invest-
ment financing in industry. Recently, the Investment Bank has also started
to make credits on its own, though funds available for this purpose are still
relatively small. The President of the Investment Bank reports directly to
the Minister of Finance, who has comprehensive authority in the planning and
financing of all projects. The Investment Bank has wide-ranging responsi-
bilities in the implementation of projects reviewing the Techno-Economic
Studies before their submission to the Council of Minsters for formal approval
and controlling the flow of funds during project execution. The Investment
Bank has no legal authority to bring its views to bear directly on the manage-
ment of an enterprise, but it can recommend necessary operational actions to
the Ministry of Finance, which, in turn, can act through the Ministry concerned
with the project.
III. THE MARKET
3.01      Although the production facilities included in the Project are only
for truck, tractor and OTR tires, the general aspects of the international and
domestic tire markets are discussed for all types of tires. Of the output of
tires from the Project, 55% are expected to go to the domestic market, 40%
to COMECON countries and 5% to other countries.
A.   World Markets and International Trade
3.02      The demand for tires, which is closely linked to the demand for
motor vehicles 1/, is generally divided into the demand for original equip-
ment tires, which is dependent on the demand for and production of new motor
vehicles and the demand for replacement tires, which depends upon cumulative
vehicle demand as measured by the stock variable - registrations. The factors
1/   Motor vehicles include passenger cars, jeeps, vans, buses, and trucks.
Farm tractors and construction equipment are excluded.

influencing vehicle use and sales therefore play a significant role in deter-
mining tire requirements. The key factors in determining vehicle demand are
population, income, geography, availability of infrastructure, transportation
policies, alternate means of transport and operating costs. Of these, income
is the most significant in determining vehicle demand, and registrations per
capita is highly correlated 1/ with income per capita:

Romania                 890                 34.2
Mexico                  890                 42.3
Yugoslavia            1,010                 61.9
Spain                 1,710                136.2
United Kingdom        3,060                276.7
United States         6,200                586.1
However, for centrally planned economies such as Romania and for many develop-
ing countries, Government policies are more important than income in determin-
ing the availability of motor vehicles, particularly of passenger cars, to the
general public. Nonetheless, inter-country comparisons serve a useful purpose
in giving some perspective to the vehicle position of a particular country.
3.03      Worldwide growth of vehicle production and registration as shown
in the table below is expected to grow at 4-5% per year until 1985, which is
about 1-2% slower than during the last fifteen years.
1/   A linear regression performed with data of 39 countries for the year
1973 gives a relationship of y = -17.2 + 0.0831 x where y is the number
of vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants and x GNP per capita. The correlation
coefficient is r   0.96.

a/   Vehicle statistics and projections differ between sources.  Data presented
is that of one major international tire company and is considered to be
realistic.
The markets in the developing countries are expected to continue to grow faster
than the ones in Western Europe and North America, although the latter two
regions are, by 1985, still expected to produce about 80% of all vehicles
and have close to 70% of worldwide registrations. The decline in the growth
rates in the developed countries are mainly attributable to lower income
elasticity of demand for motor vehicles at higher income levels and sharp
increases in manufacturing and operating costs.
3.04      Besides the production of vehicles, tires for original equipment
are determined by the number of tires required per vehicle. The worldwide
average is about 5.5 tires per vehicle. Demand for replacement tires is most
importantly determined by the number of vehicles in use, but several other
factors have a significant impact. These include vehicle usage, tire quality,
road and vehicle conditions, level of retreading and the mix between passenger
cars and trucks. On a worldwide basis, registered vehicles consume about 1.2



- 12 -
tires each annually. In developing countries where vehicle usage is high
and road conditions are poor the consumption of tires per vehicle is higher,
in developed countries it is lower.

Between 1960 and 1975, worldwide demand grew at about 6.7% per year, but
until 1985 growth is expected to slow to an average of only about 4.1%
annually. The regional distribution of growth follows closely the one for
vehicle registrations with developing countries' tire demands growing faster
than those of the more industrialized countries.
3.06      The data for vehicle production and registrations as well as for
tire demand indicate the very slow growth that took place between 1973 and
1976 caused by worldwide recession.  As a consequence of the slackening
in demand, 1977 world tire production capacity of about 800 million tires
per year exceeds demand, estimate at 640 million tires, by about 25%. Part
of this excess, however, is also caused by surplus diagonal tire capacity
resulting from the shift in dlemand to radial tires (para 3.08). Expansion
of tire production facilities now takes place mainly in the fast-growing
markets of the developing countries, and it is expected that demand and
supply will be more balanced by about 1980.
3.07      Production of tires is highly concentrated with seven companies 1/
producing 80% of world tire output. Geographically, production is likewise
concentrated in eight countries 2/ accounting for 80% of world output.
1/   These are:  Goodyear, Firestone, Uniroyal, Goodrich (all US), Michelin
(France), Dunlop-Pirelli (UK-Italy) and Bridgestone (Japan).
2/   US, France, Japan, USSR, Germany, UK, Italy, Canada.



- 13 -
Because of this concentration, international trade in tires is active with
an estimated 15-20% of total tire output being traded. The US and Canada
along with the developing countries are the main net importers while Japan
and France are the largest net exporters followed by the UK, Spain and Italy.
Because of the cost advantage involved, international tire companies establish
specialized proAuction facilities to serve the markets in different countries.
As a result, the major producing countries export as well as import tires.
3.08      The most significant recent change i.n tire technology was the
development of the radial tire which offers considerable economics to its
users. Parallel to this, lighter and stronger fibers were introduced into
tire manufacturing. The tires of the 1980s will likely be of radial construc-
tion using nylon, polyester, steel, glass fiber and aramid 1/ as reinforcing
material. In the past, efforts have been made, and these are continuing to
develop polyurethane tires of acceptable quality which could be manufactured
at one-third of the cost of present tire production. So far, however, this
has not been successful, and it is anticipated that the present technology
will basically continue to dominate tire production for at least the next
fifteen years.
B.   The Romanian Tire Market
3.09      The consumption of tires in Romania is, like in any other country,
closely linked to the production and use of vehicles. Vehicle production and
registration statistics and projections are given below:

a/   About 25% of total vehicle production is exported.
Annual production of vehicles has increased in steps caused by commissioning of
new capacity, resulting in uneven growth. The main growth in the future will
take place in production of small cars with an estimated volume of 520,000 cars
by 1985. Starting from a low base, vehicle registrations showed high growth
rates before 1970 but have now stabilized at around 11% annually and are ex-
pected to drop to about 7% by 1985.

By 1985, the number of vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants is projected to be 77;
this level of vehicles in circulation will still be low, when compared with
Romania's level of per capita income at that time (para 3.02).
3.10      Consumption of tires in Romania grew by about 11% per year over the
last twelve years and about the same growth is expected to continue until
1985 as given in detail in Annexes 3-1 and 3-2 and as summarized below:

a/   The figures for 1977 to 1980 are those of the 1976-80 Five-Year Plan.
1985 figures are "Indicative Plan" figures as they are used by Romania
for the purpose of longer range planning.
A number of characteristics of the Romanian tire market can be seen from the
above table. First, considerable growth in tire consumption has taken place
and is expected to continue. However, even with this growth, per capita
consumption of tires, with about 0.16 in 1977 and 0.34 in 1985 tires per
year, is considerably lower than in North America or Western Europe where it
has been between 0.6 and 1.0 tires in 1976. Second, requirements for passen-
ger car tires have so far been lower than for truck and tractor tires, illus-
trating the Government's policy of providing only for a limited amount of cars
for private use. However, as mentioned (para 3.09) passenger car production
for both the domestic and export markets will increase in the early 1980s and
requirements for the related passenger car tires will go up substantially.
Third, requirements for OTR tires are showing the highest growth rates. This
is caused by the Romanian plan to start manufacturing OTR equipment, such as
bulldozers, scrapers, loaders, dump trucks, etc., and by the considerable
number of planned projects requiring very large amounts of earthmoving such
as the Black Sea-Danube Canal. And fourth, the proportion of original equip-
ment tires is close to 50% of overall requirements which is high compared to
the worldwide average of about 33%. The reasons for this are that the tires
for vehicle exports are included in this category, accounting for about 30%
of original equipment tires and that the tire replacement consumption shown
is probably considerably lower than actual demand, as explained below.



- 15 -
3.11      Under the Romanian system, which allocates a certain amount of
domestic tire production to the local market, actual demand for tires is
not known and is difficult to determine. However, it appears likely that
actual demand is higher than consumption because of the Government's pre-
ference to take advantage for export opportunities and to educate motor
vehicle users on the benefits of retreading. Unofficial estimates of actual
demand range from 10-30% higher than what is consumed. Taking all of the
above into account, the projected tire requirements for Romania's domestic
needs appear reasonable and are probably conservative.
3.12      Within each Five Year Plan, which stipulates global tire pro-
duction, consumption and export targets, more detailed plans are established
for every year. Domestic tire requirements are determined by consolidating
tire needs estimated by all ministries which have motor vehicles under their
control. For estimating their needs, the various ministries, depending on
the type of tire required, use a number of norms which are derived from
historical data and adjusted to reflect changes in tire quality, road
conditions, type of use, etc. The State Planning Committee is responsible
for collecting all the required information and for making it compatible
with production and export targets. After establishing an annual plan, it
is the responsibility of CIPCMP to produce the required tires and the
Ministry of Supply is charged with their distribution to all users. For
this, the Ministry manages the finished goods warehouses at the producing
plants and has stores and retail outlets in all districts. Quantity lots
are shipped from the producing plants' warehouses to the respective users.
C.   Exports
3.13      Exports of tires from Romania grew at an average annual rate
of 11.2% over the last twelve years, which is practically the same growth
as for domestic consumption. Romanian export projections, however, show
more rapid growth--20% annually--until 1985 when they would reach 5.6 mil-
lion tires as shown below (Annexes 3-1 and 3-2):

Although truck tires were leading Romanian tire exports in the early 1960s,
passenger car tires have shown the highest average annual growth and
account now for more than 60% of exports. The exports of passenger car
tires require a minimum of technical support services and are basically
traded and marketed as consumer goods, and Romania has found it easiest
to increase exports particularly to non-COMECON countries in this category.
Truck tire exports on the other hand actually declined from 253,000 pieces
in 1965 to a low of 73,000 tires in 1974. During that time, domestic con-
sumption grew faster than production, worldwide demand for diagonal truck
tires, which were the only ones produced by the Romanians, fell off rapidly,
and the general world market for tires was depressed. With the beginning
of the production of radial truck tires, exports grew quickly during the
following two years and are estimated to have been 390,000 tires in 1977.
Tractor tire exports, because of production constraints, have stayed nearly
constant over the last seven years.
3.14      The direction of Romania's tire export is given in the table
below by type of tire for the years 1973, 1976 (actual) and 1985 (Romanian
estimate):
Direction of Romanian Tire Exports

Passenger Car Tires       33%      26%       7%       67%      74%      93%

Tractor Tires              76%     46%      75%       24%      54%      25%

By Value                 78%      70%      65%       22%      30%     35%
The above table indicates, that the direction of passenger car tire exports
is, in volume as well as value, shifting increasingly toward non-COMECON
countries, while all heavier tires will remain to be destined primarily to
the other East European countries. Within the COMECON countries, Romania,
besides Hungary, has the role of developing and producing radial all-steel
truck and tractor tires. This is laid down in long-term specialization
agreements covering the next 10-15 years. From this also results the re-
sponsibility - as formally established in long-term trade agreements - of
exporting certain quantities of these tires to the other COMECON countries.
Ongoing trade agreements presently extend to 1982, and will be as a matter of
course renegotiated thereafter. They give global export targets which are
subsequently further defined on a year-to-year basis and virtually assure
Romanian truck and tractor tire exports to COMECON countries to the extent
indicated above. At the same t:ime, the Government is interested to increase
its foreign exchange earnings from convertible currency countries and will
take advantage of opportunities to do so. In that case, exports to COMECON
countries will be reduced to the extent this can be negotiated with the



- 17 -
respective trading partners. The past record of Romanian tire exports to
COMECON countries actually shows considerable volume fluctuations from year to
year which indicate that the long-term trade agreements are flexible enough to
allow the Romanians to exploit export opportunities as they arise.
3.15      Outside COMECON, Romania presently exports to about 30 countries
with the Federal Republic of Germany, Iran and The Netherlands being the
largest importers, accounting for 31%, 25% and 7% (or together 63%) of exports,
respectively. With the considerable planned increases in exports, Romania is
following a strategy of increasing the number of countries in which it is
presented. Most importantly, Romania is planning to enter the US market with
its radial truck tires in 1978. Even though compared to Romanian production
the volume of exports is large, they constitute only a small percentage of the
international tire trade. In the past, Romanian exports accounted for about
1-2% of total international trade, and this is expected to increase to about
3-5% by 1985. Romanian tire exports also constitute only a small percentage
of the requirements of the importing countries. The Federal Republic of
Germany, for example, which has imported the largest number of Romanian tires
in the last years, had in 1976 an estimated passenger car tire market of about
33 million tires of which the Romanians supplied 210,000 tires or 0.6% which
is about 1.3% of Germany's passenger car tire imports.
D.   Balance of Production, Consumption, Imports and Exports
3.16      From the above discussion of Romania's tire production, consumption
and export projections, the following summary can be made:
Production, Consumption, Imports, Exports
(000)
---------- Actual----------   --Projected--
1970      1976    1977 (est)   1980       1985

Total                513        976   1,300         2,900   5,608

% of Production           81%        78%      74%          63%      59%
As shown, imports play a very minor role in satisfying Romania's tire needs
and are restricted to special application tires for which domestic production
would be uneconomic. The table highlights again the increasing importance of
exports and the correspondingly decreasing share of production which is
destined for the domestic market, although domestic consumption is still
expected to grow at an average 11% a year until 1985.

E.   The Project Output
3.17      The specific mix of tire sizes to be produced by the Zalau and
Turnu Severin plants has been established after analyzing the requirements of
the domestic and export markets and taking into account the configuration of
the existing production facilities. For the domestic market, the increased
availability of radial truck and tractor tires and the new production of
OTR tires will allow Romania to extend its tire production program to new
sizes and will modernize the overall product mix. The production of all
steel radial truck tires including the tubeless type forms an excellent
technological base for exports since these types of tires are in increasing
demand.
3.18      Taking into account the production of all existing and firmly
planned tire plants, the likely destination for the Project's output at
full capacity is given in the following table:
Destination of Project Output
For the Export Market
For the        to COMECON    to Other
Domestic Market    Countries       Couhtries       Total
Zalau - Truck Tires       500,000         450,000        50,000        1,000,000
Turnu Severin
- Tractor Tires         120,000          20,000        10,000          150,000
- OTR Tires              18,000           3.000           -             21,000
Total                638,000         473,000        60,000        1.171,000
in %                   55%             40%            5%             100%
The domestic market is therefore expected to absorb 50%, 80% and 85% of the
output of truck, tractor and OTR tires, respectively, with the remaining
percentages going to the export markets, mainly to COMECON countries. The
output of the Project has been taken into account in the above analysis
of Romania's domestic and export markets, and it is expected that Romania
should not encounter any difficulties to successfully market the output of
the Project as described above.
F.   Domestic Prices
3.19      Ex-factory tire prices for the domestic market are based on pro-
duction costs which include the cost of labor, materials, overheads and
depreciation but exclude any financial charges. To cover taxes and provide
for a certain profitability, total production costs are increased by an
average of 30% to arrive at the ex-factory price. Since inputs for tire
manufacturing are price controlled and have not been changed frequently, tire
prices have remained unchanged between 1966 and 1974. In 1975, a new tax on
fixed assets and land was introduced and some price reductions were made to
have more uniform profit levels for all industrial products. The resulting



- 19 -
effect was a net increase for most tire prices by about 7-25% depending on the
type of tire. In 1977, the tax on fixed assets and land was abolished and a
new tax introduced which is to more effectively equalize profit levels in the
Romanian industry. As a result, tire prices were decreased by an average of
10%.
3.20      In addition to the ex-factory price, state clients pay a distri-
bution tax of 2% while private consumers, for passenger car tires only, pay
a turnover tax of 55-58% and a distribution tax of 12%. Romanian domestic
prices to the final consumers are about 50% of retail prices prevailing in
Western Europe or the US because of their lower production and much lower
distribution costs.
G.   Export Prices
3.21      Prices for exports to COMECON countries are established according
to estimated world market prices as they can be derived from actual export
or import contracts generally with Western European countries. The absence of
duties within the COMECON countries, and the shorter transportation distances
result in Romanian export prices to COMECON countries generally being higher
than those for exports to other countries. Romanian tire exports to other
countries basically compete with the smaller local brands and other imports.
The price Romania can charge for its tires is determined by local market
conditions and is normally established by the local marketing agent. Although
the quality of Romanian tires is up to international standards, the poor
reputation of East European products in general, the absence of a well-
established and extensive dealer and service network, the sometimes somewhat
old-fashioned tread design and the lack of an intensive advertisement campaign
to educate consumers about the quality of Romanian tires have all led to the
fact that Romania cannot realize the same prices as the leading internationally
well-known companies like Michelin, Dunlop or Goodyear. For passenger car
and tractor tires, which are reasonably well established and known in some
countries, Romania competes at only slightly lower prices with the smaller
local brands and other imports. For radial truck tires, which Romania started
to export only in 1976, the price difference to smaller local brands is
initially larger. However, since the radial truck tires are of up-to-date
design, of good quality and will also be exported under the General Tire
brand name, it should be possible to increase prices to the level of the
smaller local brands within a reasonably short time.
3.22      All exports are effected by the tire division of DANUBEXIM, which
has its own marketing research group and is supported technically by the
export division of CIPCMP. For exports to COMECON countries, DANUBEXIM deals
with the respective trade organizations. For exports to other countries,
Romanian tires are marketed by dealers which in some cases handle exclusively
Romanian tires, by agents and, in the case of Germany and Italy, by joint
venture companies which not only handle tires but also other Romanian exports.
With the increasing volume of tire exports, particularly to non-COMECON
countries, the organization for export will have to be strengthened contin-
ually. The Government is considering establishing in the early 1980s a
separate Romanian export agency which would deal exclusively in tires.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope, Location and Product Mix
4.01      The Project consists of two grassrcots plants to expand annual
Romanian tire production capacity by one million truck, 150,000 tractor and
20,000 OTR tires. The truck tires plant which will be located at Zalau, is
expected to employ about 2,515 people and is scheduled to start commercial
production by early 1980. The production facilities for tractor and OTR
tires, employing about 1,800 people, will be located at Turnu Severin and
are expected to start commercial production by early 1981. Both plants will
be located in newly developed industrial estates which will provide common
facilities for the supply of power, steam and hot water. 1/ Selection of the
Project locations has been made by taking into account availability of labor,
raw materials and utilities and by considering the Government's strong pre-
ference for decentralizing secondary manufacturing industries. Zalau and
Turnu Severin are both capitals of little-industrialized districts.
4.02      As mentioned (para 3.17), the selection of specific tire sizes is
based on an analysis of present and future tire requirements in Romania as
well as in the Romanian export markets. Although seven truck, ten tractor
and ten OTR tire sizes (or together 27) have been identified for production
at Zalau and Turnu Severin, the actual product mix will be decided on a
year-to-year basis, taking into consideration changes in the structure of
demand and the best utilization of the existing tire production facilities.
However, to facilitate the overall design of the plants and for performing
the financial and economic analyses, representative tire sizes have been
selected, reducing the total number to one truck, three tractor and four
OTR tire sizes as shown in Annex 4-3. The plants' equipment, however, will
be capable of producing the whole range of the 27 tires and additional sizes
which fall into that range and which might be required in the future.
B.   Project Technology
4.03      The manufacture of tires consists of four stages (Annex 4-4):
(i)  preparation of raw materials, including mixing of
rubber compounds;
(ii)  production of the various tire components;
(iii)  assembly of the tire components into a "green" tire;
and
(iv)  curing (vulcanizing) of the "green" tire into a
finished product.
1/   Plant layouts are given in Annexes 4-1 and 4-2 for Zalau and Turnu
Severin, respectively.



- 21 -
Since the time tires have been commercially produced, these four steps
have not been changed, and tire technology, despite concerted efforts,
has remained, compared to other chemical industries, relatively labor
intensive, normally requiring an investment of about US$80,000 per job.
4.04      For the Zalau truck tire sub-project, General Tire (USA) tech-
nology will be used. This technology was purchased in 1973 and covers the
whole range of all steel radial truck tires to be manufactured by this plant.
The technology for tractor tires to be produced at Turnu Severin is essentially
proven Romanian technology which was developed over the years through close
cooperation with and transfer of technology from the USSR and Italy for
diagonal and radial construction respectively.
4.05      Romania does not yet possess the technology for the manufacturing
of OTR tire technology which only about 15 companies in the world have. At
present, Romania is inviting bids from qualified suppliers who responded to
the internatinal advertisement published in September 1977, and it is ex-
pected that an agreement will be obtained during the first half of 1978.
The licensor, probably in consortium with an equipment supplier, will supply
know-how, engineering, specialized process equipment, start-up assistance and
training for the OTR tire production as part of the Turnu Severin sub-project,
for which the licensor will also guarantee the performance. Bank approval of
the contract for the supply of technology and engineering (including know-how
and technical assistance) will be a condition of disbursement for the OTR part
of the proposed Bank Loan.
C.   Project Implementation
4.06      With approval by the Council of State of the Techno-Economic
Study for the Zalau plant, the Zalau enterprise has been created under the
Central (CIPCMP) and is responsible for the implementation of this sub-
project. The Central has considerable experience in the implementation
of new projects and is providing experienced project management and senior
staff to the Zalau enterprise. The Central, together with the enterprise,
has also direct responsibility for the procurement of local equipment and
raw materials and for the recruitment and training of personnel. In line
with the Romanian system of project implementation, several areas of pro-
ject execution have been delegated to other organizations which are well
versed in their respective tasks. Engineering and design is the responsi-
bility of the Process Engineering and Design Institute for the Chemical
Industry (IITPIC), which was established on February 1, 1977, by joining
several design institutes (IPROCHIM, IPUC and CPRP). ROMCHIM, the foreign
trade enterprise of the Ministry of Chemical Industries, is responsible
for the procurement of imported goods and services. Construction and
erection will be carried out by enterprises of the Ministry of Industrial
Buildings. The Ministry for the Chemical Industries supervises the work
and coordinates the tasks of the other ministries involved.
4.07      Preparation of the Turnu Severin sub-project is not yet as advanced
as for Zalau. The Techno-Economic Study will be finalized and the enterprise
formed only after licensing arrangements for OTR tires have been completed.
Until then, the Project preparation responsibility rests with the Central and
IITPIC. Approval by the Council of State of the Techno-Economic Study for the
Turnu Severin sub-project is expected by mid-1978. Disbursement on account of



- 22 -
the Turnu Severin sub-project will be limited to US$6 million until the Techno-
Economic Study is approved by the Government.
4.08      This scheme for Project implementation of the two sub-projects is
standard practice in Romania and has proven itself in the past. Except for
technical assistance required for the OTR tire part, overall and detailed
plant layout will be done by IITPIC and the Central. Given the experience
the organizations involved have been gaining on expansion projects over the
last ten years, Project implementation arrangements are judged to be adequate.
4.09      Implementation schedules for the two plants are given in Annex 4-5.
These schedules have been reviewed by the Bank, and the projected dates for
the start of commercial production are January 1980 and 1981 for Zalau and
Turnu Severin, respectively. For Zalau, the projected commissioning date
is the same as the target date in the Five-Year Plan. In the case of Turnu
Severin, commercial production is expected to start about one year later than
envisaged by the Five-Year Plan, basically because of the delay in obtaining
the OTR tire technology. The Central submitted detailed schedules for both
the Zalau and the Turnu Severin sub-projects; they have been received by the
Bank and found satisfactory.
D.   Domestic Equipment
4.10      As mentioned (para 2.13), development of the Romanian tire sector
has reached a stage at which the Government is interested in domestically
producing a large portion of the so far imported process equipment. Four
types of specialized machines have been identified for local manufacture.
These are: bias cutting machines (for textile cord rubber sheets only),
mills, tire building machines and curing presses. Consequently, most of the
process equipment for Zalau and the tractor tire section of Turnu Severin will
be supplied from domestic sources. Designs for this equipment were developed
by IITPC and the Central over the last two years by taking standard designs
of proven equipment previously imported and changing them to make them more
suitable for Romanian working and manufacturing conditions. Technically
well-qualified Romanian enterprises have the responsibility of manufactur-
ing the required equipment. The Bank, with the assistance of a specialized
consultant, has reviewed all the designs and manufacturing arrangements and
considers the technical risks associated with this approach acceptable. The
only question remaining is whether the Romanian manufacturing enterprises will
be able to produce the equipment in the required quantities and time. Since
the capacity of these manufacturing enterprises is more than adequate to cover
the requirements for the tire equipment, this is a question of priority
assigned to this task comparedl to the other tasks which have to be performed
by these same enterprises for other industries. The manufacture of this
equipment is included in the production programs of the respective enterprises
and has the priorities under the Five-Year Plan needed to meet the implementa-
tion schedules for the Zalau and Turnu Severin sub-projects.
E.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.11      The principal raw materials are natural rubber, synthetic rubber,
carbon black, nylon cord, metallic cord, bead wire and a large number of



- 23 -
softeners amd chemicals. All of the natural rubber, about 50% of the steel
cord and about 20% of the softeners and chemicals, will initially be imported
equivalent to about 40% of the value of the overall raw material require-
ments. By 1985, this percentage is expected to further decrease to about
25% when the production capacity for metallic cord will be sufficient for
Romania's domestic needs. All raw materials required for the manufacturing
of tires have to be produced according to precise specifications and with
tight tolerances to ensure the quality of the final product. Except for
metallic cord, the domestic production of which started only in mid-1977,
Romania has had considerable experience and has been successful in produc-
ing the raw materials required by the Project. Arrangements for the pro-
duction of metallic cord have been reviewed in detail by the Bank's consul-
tant and have been adjudged satisfactory. It is therefore expected that the
supply of raw materials will not constrain the Project.
4.12      Utility requirements will be met from facilities which form part
of the two industrial estates on which the Zalau and Turnu Severin plants will
be located (Annex 4-6). Both estates include thermal units for the generation
of steam, hot water and electricity, water preparation plants and compressed
air stations. Construction of these facilities is also under the supervision
of CIPCMP and is slightly ahead of the two tire plants so that no difficulties
are foreseen in meeting the Project's utility requirements.
F.   Employment and Training
4.13      Estimated personnel requirements of 2,515 and 1,800 for Zalau
and Turnu Severin respectively are about 20% higher than what similar plants
in Western Europe or North America would need, which, on the other hand, use
more capital intensive equipment and machinery. In line with the Government's
objective of creating industrial employment in the so far less-developed
districts, up to 80% of the personnel will be recruited from the districts in
which the plants will be located. The remaining 20% will come mostly from the
existing tire and other chemical enterprises.
4.14      Detailed training programs for Zalau and Turnu Severin have been
submitted to and found acceptable by the Bank. Training of selected per-
sonnel for Zalau, and to a more limited extent for Turnu Severin, has already
begun at the existing tire plants.
G.   Ecology and Safety
4.15      The most important pollutants are carbon black, either carried away
as fine powder to the atmosphere or washed down by rainwater, and spills and
leakages containing oil, rubber particles and dissolved chemicals. IITPIC's
specifications for the carbon black handling system call for enclosed conveyors
and silos kept at below atmospheric pressure and provided with devices to
prevent leakage. Assurances have been obtained that the Project facilities
will be operated with due regard to ecological, environmental and safety
factors.

V. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT
AND ALLOCATION OF BANK LOAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$258.2
million equivalent, including US$94.8 million equivalent in foreign exchange.
Details of the capital cost estimate and of the assumptions made are given in
Annex 5-1 and summarized below:

5.02      The estimates were prepared by IITPIC and the Central in February
1977 for Zalau and in July 1977, preliminary ones, for Turnu Severin and
reviewed by the Bank. Equipment costs for the imports required for Zalau
are based on prevailing world market prices which were verified by obtaining
quotations from suppliers. The estimate of the cost for the OTR tires section
of Turnu Severin has been jointly prepared by the Romanians and the Bank and
is based on preliminary quotations and estimates received by the Romanians



- 25 -
and the Bank's consultant on individual items. Total estimated foreign ex-
change requirements before interest during construction for Zalau are US$38
million and for Turnu Severin US$57 million. Local costs for equipment are
based on estimates made by IITPIC, which also estimated the cost for civil
works and erection. A physical contingency of 10% has been added. Price
escalation has been calculated on the basis of 1% annual increase for local
costs and 7.5% annually for foreign exchange costs.
5.03      Romanian enterprises generally have low working capital require-
ments because their accounts receivable and payable are legally fixed at
low levels and because their raw material supplies and their sales are
governed by long-term contracts with regular deliveries at predetermined
times. Incremental permanent working capital for the Project is therefore
also quite low (4% of the financing required) and is estimated at lei 202
million (US$10.1 million), reflecting mainly inventories and not including
spares, which are included under the category equipment and spares.
B.   Financing Plan
5.04      The Project is part of CIPCMP's current Five-Year Plan.  In
establishing its investment and financing plan, the Central aggregates all
approved investments of its enterprises and matches them against the
availability of funds from its enterprises through cash generation. For
this Five-Year Plan period, the fund requirements for investments exceed
the cash generation of CIPCMP by about 20%. To ensure that the funds
required for the investment program are available when required, the Central
agreed with the Ministries of Chemical Industries and Finance that CIPCMP's
enterprises will not retain any funds for investment purposes but transfer
nearly all internally generated cash to the State. The only funds that will
be retained are for paying bonuses to workers and for the reserve fund for
working capital increases, totalling about 2% of total annual cash generation.
In turn, the complete investment requirements will be funded by the State
budget and allocations made as required.
5.05      Interest during construction, which does not exist under the Romanian
system of industrial financing but will accrue on the foreign loans, will be
born by the State and not charged to the Central or the enterprises. The
financing plan will therefore be as follows:
Financing Plan
Million lei  Million US$    %
IBRD Loan                              1,700         85.0          33

- 26 -
5.06      The Council of Ministers' approval of a project automatically
includes the provision of funds required for it in the Romanian budget.
Although the financing plan shown above is, in the case of the Turnu Severin
sub-project, only a preliminary statement prior to approval of the Techno-
Economic Study, no significant change in the financing plan is expected.
The Romanian system has no simple mechanism for providing additional funds
once this approval is given, since the Council of Ministers' decision is law
and another decision of the Council would be required to authorize additional
funds. Agreement has been obtained that funds will be provided as needed for
carrying out the Project, including prompt allocation of state funds to cover
any cost overrun.
5.07      The Bank loan is proposed to be extended to the Investment Bank
for 15 years, including 3 years of grace, and at an assumed 7.45% interest
rate. As in the case of other Bank projects in Romania, the Investment Bank
would pass on the loan proceeds to the enterprises together with the State
funds. There is no formal on-lending operation from the Investment Bank to
the enterprises, but agreements have been obtained that all actions needed will
be taken to ensure that annual remittances of funds by the enterprises to the
State budget will be sufficient: to at least equal payments of interest and
principal on the Bank loan on terms assumed to be identical to those due to
the Bank, except for a notional interest rate of 10%.
C.   Procurement
5.08      A major package, estimated to cost about US$28 million, includes
imported technology, engineering and specialized process equipment for the OTR
tire plant to be constructed at Drobeta-Turnu Severin. At the Bank's request,
this package, as well as other equipment and materials to be imported, was
internationally advertised in September 1977, and embassies of all Bank member
countries and Switzerland represented in Bucharest were informed of the
Project at the same time. Eight supliers from three countries have shown
interest in the OTR package in response to these initiatives. Bidding for
the OTR package will be conducted under a modified, two-stage, procedure under
which initial technical bids were received in January, 1978 and final tech-
nical and price bids are to be submitted in May 1978.
5.09      Equipment and materiaLs to be financed by the Bank will be procured
according to the Bank's guidelines in the following manner: (i) international
competitive bidding will be used for procuring the OTR tire technology and
equipment package and other equipment, subassemblies and bulk materials esti-
mated at US$82 million of which Romanian suppliers, who would be accorded a
margin of preference of 15 percent or applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower, are expected to win equipment valued at about US$17 million (mainly
tire molds, small presses and transport equipment); and (ii) imported items
available only from a limited number of suppliers or costing less than
US$100,000 each (and up to a total of US$3.0 million) may be purchased through
international shopping on the basis of suitability, availability and price
considerations, subject to prior approval by the Bank of the list of items
involved.

D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.10      The Bank loan will cover 33% of the total financing required and
about 90% of the estimated foreign exchange requirements. The allocation of
the Bank loan is as follows:

A detailed equipment list covering all items to be financed by the Bank is
given in Annex 5-2. Changes in this list will be made only by prior agreement
between the Bank and the Borrower. The Bank loan is expected to be completely
disbursed by the end of 1981. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 5-3.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates 1/
6.01      As discussed (para 3.19), tire prices are set by the State using a
pricing principle which takes into account actual production costs and provides
1/   Annex 6 contains detailed assumptions and results of the financial
analysis.



- 28 -
for a margin to cover taxes and benefits which in the case of tires amounts to
an average of about 30% over production costs. The resulting prices are
checked against international prices and are reduced if they exceed them. For
cires, however, this does not apply since international prices are generally
well above domestic ones. For the truck tires to be produced by the Zalau
plant, the current domestic price of 2,175 lei for the representative tire
size used for this sub-project is expected to be adequate to cover production
costs and to comply with the above pricing principle (para 6.03). Prices
for tractor tires, however, are presently set too low to cover the projected
production costs of Turnu Severin. This is mainly caused by the fact that
present production facilities for tractor tires are old and depreciation
charges are much lower than they will be for the new plant. It will therefore
be necessary to increase tractor tire prices once Turnu Severin will come into
production. It is here assumed that on average the increase will be about
20%. For OTR tires, no prices have yet been set but, for the purposes of this
analysis, it is assumed that the above pricing principle will apply and OTR
tire prices have been calculated accordingly. For tires exported from the two
plants the enterprises will receive domestic prices for identical products and
DANUBEXIM will absorb any price difference between Romanian and export prices.
6.02      A comparison of Romanian prices for raw materials, utilities and
labor with those prevailing in the US during the second half of 1977, which
are slightly lower, on average, than prices prevailing in Western Europe,
clearly shows that Romanian prices are in general 30-40% below those in the
U.S. and Western Europe.
6.03      Based on these input prices and conservatively assumed quantity
requirements, the following product cost structures result for the three
types of tires produced by the Project.

For truck tires, variable costs account for about 80% of total product costs
before financial charges, which are not levied at the enterprise level. For
the heavier tractor and OTR tires, where the capital to output ratio is
higher, fixed costs play a more important role and variable costs account
for about two-thirds of total product costs. Depreciation charges, which
under the Romanian system are the only costs reflecting the value of the
initially required investment, are relatively small with an average esti-
mated depreciation period for tire plants of about 20 years.
B.   Financial Prolections

give the following main indicators:

a/   The financial projections do not provide for price changes,
since all prices are revised by the State committee for Prices
only after fairly lengthy intervals.
Zalau is expected to be profitable from the first year of operations and will
have a low break-even point of 37% capacity utilization. Also, the transfers
to the State budget will be significant allowing the State to recover its ini-
tial investment after six years of operation. The Turnu Severin sub-project
will not be as profitable as Zalau and the first year of operations is pro-
jected to result in a financial loss. Subsequent years, however, are, pro-
jected to be profitable but, under the assumed tire prices, the State would
recover its investment only after an estimated 17 years of operation. The
main reason for Turnu Severin's low profitability lies (i) in the assumed low
tractor tire price which would provide a 30% margin over production costs for
Romania's overall tractor tire production but only a 12% margin for the Turnu
Severin plant; and (ii) in the fact that the Romanian pricing system does not



- 30 -
include a provision for ensuring that the return on investment for a given
plant will be adequate. The latter makes plants with a high output to capi-
tal ratio (such as Zalau) more profitable than those where this ratio is low
(such as Turnu Severin).
6.05      As explained in para 5.05, projects in Romania are financed fully
on a "non-interest-bearing capital" basis, but funds are recovered by the
State through payments from the enterprises into several State funds. How-
ever, the amounts of interest and principal due to the Bank are shown in the
projected cash flow statements and so is a "notional" debt service coverage,
relating benefit plus depreciation to debt service on the Bank loan. This
notional debt service coverage is relatively high for Zalau (above 2.8 times
in all years) but becomes adequate for Turnu Severin only after reaching full
capacity utilization in 1983.
6.06      As mentioned (para 5.04), CIPCMP's enterprises retain only 2% of
their generated funds, and the remainder is transferred to the State which, in
turn, finances through the Investment Bank the investment program of the
Central. The financial projections for Zalau and Turnu Severin are made in
accordance with these arrangements. These arrangements whould ensure that the
total remittances by the enterprises to the State will be sufficient to cover
the equivalent in lei of the interest (at a rate of 10%) and principal to be
paid by the Investment Bank in that same year to the Bank, and an assurance to
that effect has been obtained from the Government.
C.   Financial Rates of Return
6.07      The financial rates of return for the project can be calculated as
follows:
Financial Rates of Return
Zalau - Truck Tires                            18.4%
Turnu Severin
Tractor Tires                                2.0%
OTR Tires                                     7.3%
Total Turnu Severin                       4.6%
Total Project                                  13.4%
The returns are most sensitive to changes in the assumed tire prices. Lower-
ing them by 10% would reduce the financial returns to 10% and 1% for Zalau and
Turnu Severin, respectively. Because of the nature of the Romanian pricing
system, however, the financial rates of return cannot be used as an objective
investment criterion which is obtained through the more meaningful economic
rate of return (para 7.04).
D.   Auditing and Reporting
6.08      Romania has an elaborate audit system under which enterprises submit
periodic operational and financial reports to their Central, Ministry and
Investment and National Banks. These reports serve to ensure achievement



- 31 -
of plan targets and proper use of funds. Though the contents and presentation
of these reports differ from those normally received by the Bank, it has been
possible to adjust them to provide sufficient information for the Bank to ade-
quately monitor the progress of project implementation and operations. The
Bank will receive from the Investment Bank quarterly project progress reports
prepared by the enterprises and annual financial statements in a form satis-
factory to the Bank and, within four months after the end of each year,
copies of annual audit reports of the enterprises prepared by the Ministry
of Finance. An assurance to that effect has been obtained from the Govern-
ment.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
7.01      All economic benefits and costs for tradeable items have been
determined by using expected long-term international prices estimated to
prevail in the early to mid-1980s. For non-tradeable items, domestic
prices have been taken and, where applicable, adjusted to reflect the
economic price of their internationally traded components. All detailed
assumptions are given in Annex 7.
7.02      About 65% of the Project's total economic costs are caused by
five raw material items: natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black,
metallic cord and nylon cord. All of these are widely traded, and it is
projected that 1977 real price levels will hold true in the future. The
remaining raw materials consist of a very large number of chemicals for
which international prices are estimated to be, on average, about 25%
above Romanian domestic prices. The economic costs of electricity and
steam have been assumed to be 50% higher than Romanian prices to reflect
the difference between Romanian and international fuel price levels. For
labor and other operating costs, financial costs have been taken for the
economic analysis.
7.03      Although tires are widely traded, actual export prices are not
publicized, and tire companies are very secretive about prices and produc-
tion costs. In order to estimate long-term international tire prices, three
approaches have been taken, and the results of all three have been combined
to establish low, expected and high tire price levels (Annex 7). First,
Romania supplied the Bank with actual 1976/77 import and export prices for
the types and sizes of tires produced by the Project. Second, long-term
economic production costs have been estimated by using international input
prices, different levels of capital investment requirements reflecting the
different age structure of tire production facilities and a 20% return on
investment requirement (before financial charges and taxes). Third, minimum
tire price levels have been determined for an investor building plants simi-
lar to Zalau and Turnu Severin by stipulating a minimum financial internal
rate of return of 10%. The results of the analysis are given in the follow-
ing table:



- 32 -
Estimated International Tire Price Levels a/
Low      Expected   High
Truck Tires (US$/Set) b/            130         145       160
Tractor Tires (US$/Kg) c/           1.70        1.90      2.50
OTR Tires (US$/Kg) c/               2.20        2.50      2.90
a/   Prices shown are cif Romania.  For determining the
economic rate of return cif and fob prices are used
as appropriate.
b/   Representative tire size used is 11.00-R20.
Set includes inner tube and flap.
c/   Because of the large number of different sizes,
the calculations have been made on an average
value per unit: weight basis.
For tractor and OTR tires, the range of prices is broader than the one for
truck tires because the effect of different assumptions regarding the invest-
ment costs and return requirements is much larger than for truck tires where
variable costs are the determining factor.
B.   Economic Rates of Return
7.04      Using the above assumptions, the following economic rates of
return can be calculated:
Economic Rates of Return
Z of Project Cost    Low       Expected      High
Zalau - Truck Tires               54%            16%        24%         32%
Turnu Severin
Tractor Tires                   25%            12%        17%         29%
OTR Tires                       21%            15%        19%         25%
Total Turnu Severin          46%            13%        18%        27%
Overall Project                  100%            14%        22%         30%
Thus even under the assumption of low tire price levels, which are not
likely to prevail over an extesnded period of time, the economic returns
are still acceptable. The returns are very sensitive to changes in the
assumed price levels, especiaLly for Zalau where investment costs are
less important than yearly costs and benefits.
7.05      The satisfactory economic rate of return of 22% reflects the fact
that Romania is well endowed for the economic production of tires.  Except
for natural rubber, all major raw materials are produced domestically. In
addition, Romania has a well-established technological base and a well-dis-
ciplined and effective labor force at a considerably lower cost than other
tire manufacturing countries. Finally, Romania is close to the markets of
the COMECON, Western European and Mediterranean countries and therefore pays
relatively small transport costs on its tire exports.



- 33 -
C.   Other Benefits
7.06      The Project's two plants will both be located in districts with
relatively little industry and will therefore contribute to the Government's
objectives of a more regionally balanced industrial structure. Industrial
employment will increase by about 4,300 persons. The investment per person
employed is about US$58,000. At full capacity, the Project will yield net
annual foreign exchange savings (before debt service on the Bank loan) of
about US$150 million.
D.   Risks
7.07      The Project faces three main risks.  First, the Zalau and Turnu
Severin plants will be the first complete tire plants designed and imple-
mented by the Romanian design institutes and the Central with the only out-
side assistance being extended to the OTR tire section of Turnu Severin.
However, given the fact that Romania has gained considerable experience in
the execution of tire projects through its numerous expansion programs and
that the Zalau plant will be basically a repeat of the recently completed
plant at Victoria, this risk is acceptable. Second, for the first time,
a large number of process equipment for tire production is being designed
and manufactured in Romania to be supplied to the Project. As discussed
(para 4.10), this constitutes a technical risk which is reduced because
the designs are basically based on proven equipment modified to take into
account Romanian working and manufacturing conditions and because Romanian
manufacturing capabilities are considered to be satisfactory for this type
of work. The remaining question is whether Romanian enterprises will be
able to produce the equipment in the required quantities and time. However,
since this equiment is included in the manufacturing program of the respec-
tive enterprises and has the priorities under the Five-Year Plan needed
to meet the implementation schedules for the Zalau and Turnu Severin sub-
projects, this risk appears acceptable. Also, since tire production takes
place in many lines in parallel and since capacity utilization during the
first year of operation is not expected to exceed 60%, some delay for a
portion of machinery to be produced by Romania is not likely to adversely
affect production. Third and finally, although only 19% of the output of
Turnu Severin is likely to be exported, 50% of the output of truck tires from
Zalau is directed to the export market, which constitutes some marketing risk.
However, 80 to 90% of tire exports from the Project would be to other COMECON
countries within the framework of long-term trade agreements covering the
next 10 to 15 years. Under such agreements, Romania (along with Hungary) is
responsible for developing and producing radial, all steel truck and tractor
tires to help meet planned consumption of such tires in COMECON. These
arrangements recognize Romania's comparative advantage in producing high
quality tires at competitive costs. Specific trade agreements are routinely
renegotiated within the framework of the specialization agreements noted
above. The latest such agreement for truck and tractor tires extends to
1982, and no exceptional problems are anticipated in marketing Project output
profitably.



- 34 -
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Agreements have been reached as follows:
(i)  Project facilities will be operated with due regard
to ecological, environmental and safety standards
acceptable to the Bank (para 4.15);
(ii) funds will be provided as needed to implement the
Project and to meet any cost overruns (para 5.06);
(iii) goods and services will be procured on the basis of
lists agreed upon. (para 5.09);
(iv) total annual remittances by the project enterprises
to the State will be adequate to cover debt service
(para 6.06); and
(v)  the Investment Bank will submit quarterly project
progress reports and annual financial statements in
a form satisfactory to the Bank. Also the Bank will
receive within four months after the end of each year
copies of annual audit reports of the enterprises
prepared by the Ministry of Finance (para 6.08).
8.02      In addition, agreiements on the following conditions of disburse-
ment have been obtained:
(i)  approval by the Bank of the contract for the OTR tire
technology and engineering package will be required before
disbursing against this item (para 4.05); and
(ii) establishment of t:he Turnu Severin enterprise (para 2.15)
and approval by the Government of the Techno-Economic
Study for Turnu Severin (para 4.07) will be required before
disbursing above US$6 million on the account of the Turnu
Severin sub-projec:t.
8.03      Based on the agree!ments reached on the above points, the Project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$85 million to the Investment Bank to be
repaid over 15 years, including three years of grace.

ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR ESTIMATION OF CAPITAL COSTS
1.        Detailed capital cost estimates have been prepared by IITPIC
together with the Central. In the case of Zalau, the estimates are
consistent with the data in the Techno-Economic Study. For Turnu Severin,
they present best estimates based on recent quotations and mid-1977 US
equipment prices.
2.        Romanian estimates are generally prepared including price escalation
and physical contingencies except for a 5% contingency on local costs. To
determine whether or not cost estimates are realistic, physical contingencies
and price escalation were subtracted to arrive at a mid-1977 base cost
estimate.
3.        All equipment costs include foreign and local transportation
charges. Detailed equipment lists are provided in the Project File. Under
the Romanian system, spares are not included in the initial investment costs
but are paid out of the operating budgets of the enterprises. Here, to fully
reflect the foreign exchange costs of the project, a relatively small
provision (3% of equipment value) for spares of imported equipment is
included. Duty on imports is not included in the cost estimate because it
is not yet decided whether or not duty would have to be paid.
4.        Physical contingencies are included at an average 10% of the base
cost estimate. For provision of price escalation, locally procured items
have been assumed to increase by 1% p.a. while for imports 7.5% p.a. is
assumed.
5.         Interest during construction is calculated on the basis of a US$85
million Bank loan at 7.45% interest per year. The Bank loan will be used to
the extent of US$37 million for Zalau and US$48 million for Turnu Severin.
The estimated disbursements are as follows:
(US$ Million)      1978    1979    1980    1981    Total
Zalau                7.9    23.8      5.3      -       37.0

ANNEX 6

ROMANIA - TIRE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. General
1.        Projections of the likely financial status of the two sub-projects
are done in constant 1977 lei since domestic inflation has been and is
expected also in the future to be very small. Also, it is the general
pricing policy in Romania to adjust output prices in line with changes in
the prices of inputs. Therefore, it is likely that any future price re-
visions, although changing the absolute level of revenues and costs, will
not basically change the structure of the projections made here.
B. Product Mix
2.        As discussed in Chapter IV of the main report, one representative
truck tire size is used for Zalau and three tractor and four "off-the-road"'
(OTR) tire sizes for Turnu Severin.
C. Tire Prices
3.        For truck tires, 1977 Romanian prices have been used.  Current
tractor tire prices for the proposed product mix of Turnu Severin would
average about 2,147 lei per tire, which is about 7% below the estimated
production costs of 2,301 lei per tire. Since it is pricing policy in Romania
to set prices high enough to cover production costs and to provide on the
average for tires a 30% margin for taxes and benefits, it has been assumed
that tractor tire prices will be revised after commissioning of the Turnu
Severin plant. On average, a 20% increase in tractor tire prices has been
assumed. OTR tire prices have not yet been set by the Government. Since Turnu
Severin will be the only plant producing these tires, OTR tire prices have
been assumed at 30% over projected production costs. The table on page 4
gives a summary of the assumed product mix and tire prices at full capacity.
For comparison, the table also gives economic price assumptions.
D. Production Costs
4.        The tables on pages 5-7 give the breakdown of production costs
for Zalau and for the tractor and OTR sections of Turnu Severin. Quantity
requirements for raw materials and utilities have been estimated by IITPIC
together with the Central and provide for waste between 4% (for tractor
tires) and 10% (for truck and OTR tires) which is reasonable.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        Prices of domestic raw materials are 1977 ex-factory prices.  To
provide for delivery to the two plants, a 3% internal transportation charge
has been added to the cost of raw materials. The price for utilities is
an estimate prepared by IITPIC and the Central. Actual prices will depend on
a number of factors which have not yet been worked out in detail.
6.        Labor requirements have been determined by IITPIC and the Central,
and the average annual salary of 30,260 lei (US$1,513 equivalent) is based
on present pay levels within Romania's industry.
7.        Depreciation of fixed assets is based on the recently revised
schedule resulting for a tire plant in a rate of 4-5% per year. An annual
rate of 5% has been assumed here.
8.        Other production costs, mainly maintenance materials and adminis-
trative costs, have been estimated by IITPIC and the Central based on the
actual costs of the existing tire plants.
9.        Again, for comparison, economic costs are given in the same tables.
10.       The split of costs for utilities and fixed costs between the
tractor and OTR sections of the Turnu Severin plant has been made using the
following key:
Key for Splitting of Fixed Costs for Turnu Severin
Cost                      Basis                      Key
1.  Utilities             Relative Weight of          62% Tractor Tires
Labor                 Tractor and OTR             38% OTR Tires
Other Fixed Costs    Tire Throughput
2.  Depreciation          Estimate of Tractor         54% Tractor Tires
and OTR Tire Equipment    46% OTR Tires
Costs
11.       Raw material quantities have been estimated directly for tractor
and OTR tires, respectively.
E. Production and Income Statements
12.       The tables on pages 8 and 9 show the projected production and
income statements for the two sub-projects for the first five years of
operation. For Zalau, commercial production is assumed to start January 1,
1980, for Turnu Severin, it is January 1, 1981. The statements show transfers
of production to finished goods inventory which, with the assumed level of
five days, hardly lowers the sales volume in the initial years. Revenues
and production costs have been calculated in accordance with the assumptions
stated above. In addition, it has been assumed that raw material and utility
requirements will be 6% and 3% higher in the first and second year of operation
than in subsequent years. The benefit tax shown in calculated to limit



ANNEX 6
Page 3
benefits of the enterprises to 15% of total production costs. The actual tax
rate provided in the decree No. 104 is a function of the profitability of the
enterprise but has, in essence, the effect of siphoning all benefits above
15% to the budget.
F. Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets
13.       Tables on pages 10-11 show the projected cash flow and balance
sheet accounts. Although the enterprises are not paying the debt service on
the Bank loan, these are shown and a notional debt service coverage is
calculated. Working capital requirements are as per Annex 5-1, page 3.
14.       Except for retention of funds to pay a bonus to workers (calculated
at 2% of labor cost) and for the reserve fund for increased requirements of
working capital (calculated at 1% of net working capital), all funds are
transferred to the State budget.
G. Financial Rates of Return
15.       Financial rates of return are calculated for the two sub-projects,
for the two sections of Turnu Severin and for the project as a whole. The
cash flows and results are given on page 12, all returns are in 1977 constant
terms.

ROMANIA - TIRE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR CALCULATING THE ECONOMIEC ?&JTES OF RETURN
A. General
1.        The economic rates of return for Zalau and Turnu Severin have been
calculated in constant mid-1977 dollars. All benefits and costs for trade-
able items have been determined by using expected long-term international
prices estimated to prevail in the 1980s. For non-tradeable items, domestic
prices have been adjusted to reflect the international price level of their
foreign component. Labor, which accounts for only about 4-8% of total
economic operating costs,has not been shadow priced and its financial cost
has been used.
B. Capital Costs
2.        The capital costs used for calculating the financial rate of return
can also be used here, since these do not include any transfer prices.
C. Operating Costs
3.        About 65% of the project's total economic costs are caused by
five raw material items: natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black,
metallic cord and nylon cord. Each one of these items is discussed below
and a summary of the assumptions is given in page 6.
4.        The historical development and future prospects of natural rubber
are discussed in detail in the Bank's report "Price Prospects for Major
Primary Commodities" (July 1977, Report No. 814/77), and the price projection
of about US$0.42/lb (RSSI, cif New York) is used in this analysis.
5.        The same report includes a discussion on synthetic rubber,
projecting SBR (styrene buta,liene rubber)./ prices to be about 10% below
natural rubber prices or US$0.38/lb. Assuming a transport cost of about
5% of the value of SBR, the economic cost to Romania of using SBR for this
project is estimated at US$0.36/lb.
6.        Prices for carbon black are closely linked to the price of fuel
oil No. 6, the feedstock required for the manufacturing of this raw material,
which in turn is linked to the price of crude oil. On the basis of the
Bank's projected crude oil price of about US$12.5 per barrel, carbon black
prices per pound are about 1.12% of this crude oil price or about US$0.14/lb.
1/ The project uses a number of SBRs (1500, 1502, 1712) and smaller quantities
of Butyl rubbers. SBR1500 accounts for the major portion and its price can be
used as a representative average for all synthetic rubbers required by the project.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
Again assuming a 5% transport cost from Romania to her export markets, the
economic cost of carbon black is estimated at US$0.133/lb.
7.        Metallic cord is produced only by a limited number of companies
which export widely. For the three types of metallic cord needed by the
project (Zalau only), the following prices prevailed in mid-1977 delivered
to US plants and fob Europe:
-------US$/lb--------
Delivered       fob
Metallic Cord              to US Plants   Europe
7 x 4 x 0.022 mm                       1.240       1.085
7 x 4 x 0.175 mm                       1.270       1.110
7 x 4 x 0.22 + l x 1 x 0.15 mm         1.345       1.205
8.        These prices are expected to increase in current terms but no
increases in real terms are forecast. Prices delivered to US plants include
duty of about 4% and freight and insurance of US$0.09/lb.  The weighted
average price for the project requirements would be about US$1.15/lb fob
Europe. With a transport charge of 5% on value, the maximum realizable export
fob price for Romania would be US$1.09/lb, which is used in this analysis.
9.        Nylon cord (1260/2) prices in the US and Western Europe in mid-1977
were at US$1.16/lb. Analysis by the major producers indicate that production
capacity for this fiber should be adequate for the next ten years so that no
change in the real price level is expected. An export price of US$1.10/lb
fob Romania is used here as the economic cost of nylon cord.
10.       The remaining raw materials consist mainly of a very large number
of chemicals for which international prices are estimated to be, on average,
about 25% above Romanian domestic prices. The economic costs of electricity
and steam have been assumed at US$0.0225 per kwh and US$6.50 per ton,
respectively, compared to Romanian prices of US$0.015 per kwh and US$4.50
per ton of steam. For labor and other operating costs, financial costs have
been taken for the economic analysis.
C. Economic Benefits
11.       Although tires are traded widely, prices at which transactions are
executed are not publicized and tire companies are very secretive about
prices and in particular about their production costs. The export price
lists published by all major tire companies do not give any indication of
actual prices, since substantial discounts are granted. The extent of the
discounts varies from customer to customer and on the quantities of tires
supplied. Under these circumstances, projections of future tire prices as
derived from a historical analysis is therefore not possible.
12.       The only reliable source of actual world market prices has been
provided by the Romanian Government in the form of actual import and some
export prices for specific sizes of tires for 1976/77. The information
provided is tabulated in page 7 for the sizes to be produced by the
project. All imports/offers are from non-COMECON countries.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
13.       For truck tires, wlhere the ll-R20 size is used as the representative
tire size, the 1977 import price (from Austria) is about US$148 (cif) including
inner tube and flap.  In comparison, Romania is presently realizing only  bout
US$100-130 for her tire exports to Western Europe, which are, however, very
limited in quantity. The difference is accounted for by transportation
(average of 7% of value between Western Europe and Romania), duty (about 4%)
and by the fact that all East European products including tires are little
known and can only be sold at a discount. This is especially true for all-
steel radial truck tires which Romania only started to produce and export
in 1976. Exports to other COMECON countries are realized according to prices
prevailing in Western Europe and are therefore not affected by the poor
reputation. From the above, the 1977 truck tire prices as applicable to the
project are about: US$150 cif for imports, US$120 fob for exports to Western
Europe and about US$140 fob for exports to other COMECON countries. Further
below these prices will be compared to estimated long-term production costs.
14.       For the output of t'he Turnu Severin plant, it is more convenient,
because of the large number of tire sizes, to establish a weighted average
price per kg for tractor and OTR tires. As shown in page 7, the average for
tractor tires comes to US$1.70/kg and for OTR tires to about US$2.35/kg. For
Turnu Severin as a whole, the average price would be US$1.90 per kg. Information
received unofficially from several US tire manufacturers indicates about the
same price level. Exports from Turnu Severin are small and mainly to COMECON
countries with a transport cost of about 5% of the value of the tire.
15.       Despite the general worldwide surplus of tire production capacity,
the above prices should more or less reflect present production costs
because demand for all radial tires and heavier tires (i.e., truck tractor,
OTR) has been much less affected by the recession than diagonal type tires
and the lighter, more vulnerable passenger car tire.
16.       Page 8 oompares the above prices to expected long-term economic
production costs basically using the same input/output coefficients as used
for the project, about 25% lower labor requirements, previously established
raw material and utility prices and capital costs for plants with the same
product mix as Zalau and Turnu Severin. For calculation of capital charges,
two levels of capital costs have been assumed.
(i) Capital costs at 1977 level, same as for the project; and
(ii) capital costs at about 1970 levels, which were about 50%
of those in 1977.
17.       This is to reflect t]hat the large tire companies have a mix of
tire plants operating of different age and their pricing will take this into
account.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
18.       The results of this analysis show that long-term costs for truck
tires will be between US$130-150 per set, for tractor tires between US$1.83-2.33
per kg and for OTR tires between US$2.07-2.71 per kg. For truck and OTR tires
this agrees well with the above prices determined from the Romanian import
data. For tractor tires, the US$1.70 per kg calculated from the import data
is low compared to the range of estimated long-term costs which only starts
at about this level. However, production facilities for this category of
tires, where radial construction is making inroads only slowly, will likely
continue to include a very large portion of old equipment with companies
directing their resources first to the new equipment required for radial
passenger car and truck tires. A price level in the lower part of the range
can therefore be expected.
19.       Finally, assuming that a company building plants like Zalau and
Turnu Severini/ requires a minimum internal rate of return of 10%, the
minimum long-term equ'ilibrium price levels will have to be US$131 per truck
tire and US$1.85 per kg of tractor and US$2.15 per kg of OTR tire.
20.       The following table summarizes the tire price levels as calculated
above:

Low                                      130           1.70          2.20
Most Likely                              145           1.90          2.50

21.       The three price levels given in the "Range" are used in this analysis
to calculate low, most likely and high economic rates of return.  For tires
1/ Using the same price assumptions as on page 8.

to be exported to COMECON countries, a 5% transportation cost is subtracted.
For truck tire exports (5% of output of Zalau) to Western Europe, 80% of
the cif price is used.
D. Economic Rates of Return
22.       Using the above economic costs and benefits, the economic rates of
returns are calculated, and the results are given on page 9.
