MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A RURAL PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposea loan to
the Kingdom of Morocco for US$83 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate with
a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years' grace, and would help finance a Rural
Primary Education Project.
2.          Background. Government efforts in the education and training sector
since Independence have focussed on quantitative and qualitative improvements
to meet the needs of a growing economy and a population growth in excess of 2.51
p.a. Following an initial effort to expand primary level enrolments, the 1970s
and early 1980s saw more rapid enrolment growth at the costlier secondary and
post-secondary levels. This expansion took place against a background of slower
economic growth, deterioration of the balance-of-payments and serious fiscal
deficits. Recurrent expenditures for education grew very fast, reaching 29X of
government recurrent expenditures in 1987, compared with 141 in 1975. At the
same time, education investment oxpenditures were severely curtailed, declining
by nearly 40X between 1982 and 1985 in real terms. Moreover, scarce resources
were used overwhelmingly to accommodate growing enrolments, while complementary
expenditures needed to sustain and improve the quality of education were
neglected.
This situation has been recognized by the Government, which in 1985
t-mbarked on a comprehensive program of reforms in the education sector supported
by the Bank through the Education Sector Reform Loan (2664-MOR, approved on
March 20, 1986). The objectives of the reform program are to make the provision
of education more equitable, more cost-effective, and more consistent with the
country's medium-term development needs. The main long-term engine of change
is the adoption of a nine-year universal basic education standard, requiring
expansion of primary and lower secondary systems, with compensating reductions
in the pass rates into further education. During the first phase of the program
(1986-1988), satisfactory progress was achieved in improving participation and
efficiency at primary and secondary levels, while developing new curricula and
teaching methods aimed at improvinig the quality of education.   In higher
education, some successes were achieved in terms of better targetting of
seholarships and increased productivity of teaching staff. However, program
performance falls short of expectations in two areas because of the continuing
high demand for public higher education. After meeting the reform program target
for limiting growth of new university entrants to only 21 in 1985-86 and 1986-
87, new entrants increased by 211 in 1987-88.   New entrants for 1988-89
maintained at approximately the 1987-88 level. Al.3o, student grants have been
reduced substantially but registration fees have not been introduced. A number
of alternative options for financing higher education are now being investigated
through sector work.

4.          Sector strategy. The Government's current strategy in the education
sector reflects the continuing need to consolidate gains in basic education.
To protect investments, particularly those needed to expand primary and lower
secondary intakes, the Government has formulated, in consultation with the Bank,
a program of minimum public investments in line with the priorities defined in
the Education Reform Program. Accordingly, priority investments are directed
to: expand and improve primary education to provide universal access to primary
schooling by the beginning of the next century; increase attendance in lower
secondary schooling in line with the introduction of a 9-year basic education
entitlement from 1990; and, selectively improve the quality of higher education,
especially by giving greater autonomy to individual institutions and targetting
public subsidies to students. As a followup to the Sector Reform Loan, which
is fully committed and expected to close this year, Government is preparing with
Bank assistance two investment loans in the primary (the project proposal below)
and secondary subsectors. Finally, the Bank is supporting Government's strategy
of upgrading the quality of vocational training services, and reinforcing the
links between Moroccan employers and public and private training institutions.
A joint review of industrial training priorities is underway, and expected to
lead to further Bank investment assistance in this area.
5.          Primary Education: Access. Attendance and Ouality. Despite important
progress made during the last three decades in the education sector, primary
education is still not available to a large proportion of the rural population,
especially in remote and sparsely populated areas. About 6,500 small communities
(22% of villages) with population below 1,000 have no access to primary schocl.
In addition to overall capacity constraints, attendance of rural girls is
extremely low compared with boys and with their urban counterparts. In 1987-
88, new entrants in Grade 1 accounted for only 341 of rural girls and 691 of
rural boys of age 7, compared with 851 and 891 in urban areas, respectively.
To improve school attendance, the Government is committed to improving the
quality of basic education in the areas of curriculum and standard achievement
testing, teacher training and deployment, multigrade teaching practices, school
management, and school food and health services, to adapt school schedules to
local needs, and to help lower the costs of school books and materials paid by
parents: progress on all these fronts is needed to translate improved access
into increased attendance.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The proposed project sustains,
develops and reinforces the key policy orientations in basic education adopted
under the Education Sector Reform Program which has a 10 to 15-year horizon.
It supports providing universal access to basic education by the beginning of
next century. This long-term objective will require sustained Government effort,
further improvements in school system capacity, efficiency and quality, and
continuing external support.   These orientations have been confirmed in the
context of the Structural Adjustment Loan (Loan no. 3001-NOR) and the recent
Public Investment Review, which recognize that sustained, targetted investments
in the social sectors are a key to long-term economic development.
7.          Proiect Objectives.  The overall objective of the proposed project
is to implement rapid, yet sustainable expansion and improvement of primary
education in rural areas. This implies a set of interrelated measures to: (a)
increase access to primary schooling; (b) increase rural primary education



3
.Ccendance, particularly for girls; (c) improve the quality of primary education;
(d) strengthen planning, monitoring and evaluation capacity at all levels of the
school system; and (e) strengthen the efficient and rational utilization of
resources in the sub-sector.
8.          Proiect Description.  The proposed project would assist the Ministry
of Education (MOE) to establish and equip over 11,600 new classrooms and related
school facilities, including 1400 school canteens, 2900 staff housing units, and
a pilot program of sanitary facilities, and water pumping and storage facilities
in about 120 under-supplied areas.   It would promote rural primary school
attendance by: (a) improving accessibility and affordability of textbooks and
educational materials through distribution of an initial stock of textbooks to
be lent out by school cooperatives; and, (b) supporting community initiatives
to encourage families to send children to school with a special emphasis on
enrolment of girls. The project would also improve the quality of education by
supporting the development of curricula and of standardized achievement testing
modules; improve effectiveness of teacher selection, pre- and in-service
training, and deployment cf teachers in rural areas; improve multi-grade
teaching; strengthen school management; and introduce health education curricula
and improve delivery .f school health services in collaboration with the Ministry
of Public Health. The project would also strengthen MOE school mapping services
and monitoring and impact evaluation capacity.
9.          Policy Measures.  In light of the budgetary constraints affecting
primary education, a series of complementary measures to improve quality and
contain costs through restructuring of staff recruitment, training and deployment
standards have been included in the project. These measures were developed with
Bank assistance. They include, in particular: (a) standardizing teacher entry
qualifications at the secondary school diploma level, plus two years in teacher
training centers, a major improvement from the present system which favors
candidates with university education but provides only one year of professional
training: these teachers are not only paid more for the same job through most
of their career, they are also less likely to want to remain assigned to rural
primary schools; (b) streamlining administrative functions at secondary level
through redeployment of non-teaching staff according to revised staff allocation
rules. These measures would generate recurrent expenditure savings estimated
at US$15 million per year when fully implemented (equal to total non-salary
expenditures for primary education in 1988). In addition, MOE is introducing
measures to sustain quality improvements by establishing specific cost norms and
budgetary allocations for primary education expenditures on educational
materials, teacher supervision, staff training, and school maintenance.
10.         Project Costs and Financing.  The total cost of the project net of
taxes and duties is estimated at US$140 million with a foreign exchange cost of
US$69.7 million. The IBRD Loan of US$83 million would cover about 60% of total
project costs net of taxes and duties. A proposed African Development Bank (ADB)
loan would finance an additional US$40 million in parallel. Together, the Bank
and ADB would finance 89% of total project costs net of taxes and duties,
including all foreign exchange and some local costs. The remaining local costs
(US$42 million including US$25 million in taxes and duties) would be financed
from the government investment budget. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are



4
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing ever.ts and the status of Bank
Group operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7434-MOR dated February 14, 1989,
is3 being distributed separately.
11.         Agreed Actions.    The Governrent would implement  the measures
reflected in para. 9 above within an annual work program reviewed regularly with
the Bank. Government also provided assurances that a feasibility study on the
provision and distribution of spectacles will be finalized by September 30, 1990.
12.         Benefits.   The main benefits  anticipated stem from  increased
enrolments in rural primary education. By project completion in 1995, enrolments
are expected to have increased by about 370,000 (+38X), with attendance by girls
up by over 200,000 (+75X). The gross enrolment rate in rural areas would reach
79% and 49% of rural boys and girls of primary school age, as against 731 and
30% in 1987-88, respectively. The project would also: test innovative approaches
for increasing enrolment rates of rural girls; lead to qualitative gains in pupil
achievement throu[,h improved quality of teachers, curricula and instructional
materials; and, contain the growth of incremental expenditures, through
rationalization of teacher employment and training policies, non-teaching staff
redeployment, and increased priority to non-salary budgetary allocations for
primary education expenditures.
13.         Risks.  During protracted fiscal austerity, the risk remains that
Government may have to divert funds away from critical non-salary expenditures
in the primary education subsector. However, special attention has been given
to establishing the basis for appropriate budgetary allocations within the
education sector through a target public investment program developed in the
context of the Structural Adjustment Loan.  Monitoring of specific technical
norms for non-salary expenditures will be undertaken during supervision of the
proposed loan.   The project also includes several experimental components
(notably provision of low-cost textbooks to school cooperatives, and community-
based activities to promote female participation) whose outcomes are uncertain.
These initiatives have however obtained clear endorsement from the Government,
and will be monitored systematically v xing project execution.
14.         Recg=ndatio .  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
