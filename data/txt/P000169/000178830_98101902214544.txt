INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$5.0 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a Highway Maintenance Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Political situation
2.        The internal political situation in Burundi is difficult.
Burundi's population consists of two ethnic groups, the ruling Tutsi
minority and the Hutu majority, who since the Hutus overthrew the Tutsi
in Rwanda in 1962, have tried on several occasions to gain control in Burundi
also. Although the Tutsis and Hutus have intermarried and the present
regime includes several Hutus as Ministers, the conflict remains. It is
aggravated by the generally dominant role of the Tutsis in economic activity.
3.        Conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus occurred in 1965, 1969 and lastly,
in 1972. The latter resulted in severe counter-measures by the Government
and a virtual civil war. Although law and order was essentially restored in
the fall of 1972, the situation has remained unstable and much of the Govern-
ment's attention has been concentrated on non-developmental activities.
4.        Several Bank missions visited Burundi in 1972 and 1973 to evaluate
the situation in the country and to review the prospects of IDA operations
in Burundi. With the restoration of reasonable calm in the country, there
are now indications that the Government will attend to development projects;
attention is already being paid to the formulation and execution of projects.
Aid agencies active in Burundi have resumed their operations and now con-
sider the implementation of projects to be reasonably satisfactory.
Economic situation
5.        An economic mission visited Burundi in November 1973, and its re-
port will be circulated to the Executive Directors in the next few months.
Country data are provided in Annex I.
6.        Burundi, a landlocked country, is one of the poorest countries in
the world, and among the 25 countries defined by the UN as least developed.
GDP per capita averaged about $65 in 1970-72; it is even lower in the rural
areas where 95% of the 3.4 million population live on agriculture and barely
meet the minimum nutritional standards. Agriculture accounts for about 64%



of GDP and the secondary sector, including manufacturing and construction,
accounts for 12%. Less than 4% of the active population are employed in the
modern sector, where they earn nearly 28% of national income. Over the past
decnde, income per capita seems to have stagnated, although in 1970-1971,
real income rose by 10% as a result of combined increases in production and
in export prices of coffee, the main export. In 1970-1972, gross investment
averaged only 7% of GDP. The civil strife in 1972 had an adverse effect on
the economy. Cotton production declined by about 35% from 8,800 tons in 1971
to 5,700 tons, and fishing by 66% from 16,800 to about 7,400 tons. In addi-
tion, because of cyclical fluctuations, coffee production in 1972 decreased
by 22.5% from 25,150 tons in 1971 to 19,500 tons.
7.        Burundi faces serious constraints to economic development.   These
are: (a) high population pressure on scarce land resources, (b) heavy
dependence on coffee exports and lack of clear alternatives, (c) insuffi-
cient economic infrastructure, and (d) scarcity of skilled manpower.
8.        With about 136 inhabitants per square kilometer, Burundi's
population density is among the highest in Africa. Nearly all available
land is occupied. High population pressure tends to keep the standard of
living close to subsistence level. To provide adequate supplies of do-
mestic foodstuff, the Government's first development plan (1968-1972) empha-
sized development of agriculture. This strategy is to be continued under
the draft second plan (1973-1977) which provides for investment of about $52
million to increase agricultural productivity and to diversify production.
9.        Because of the country's small size and the resulting limitations
of its domestic market, Burundi's development depends mainly on increasing
exports, in particular of coffee, which is the country's most important cash
crop. During 1970-1972, the share of coffee in total export earnings varied
between 85% and 95%. It is cultivated by some 400,000 farmers on small plots.
To reduce the country's dependence on coffee, the Government, with foreign
assistance, is making an effort to diversify the economy by introducing tea
production and promoting cotton cultivation.   Thus far, the iuipact of these
efforts is limited; the development of tea production is still in its first
phase, while cotton production has been adversely affected by the recent dis-
turbances. Substantial deposits of nickel ore have been discovered in the
center of the country, with probable reserves estimated at 180 million tols
of ore averaging 2% of nickel. But it will take at least five years before
these deposits can be exploited. Coffee is, therefore, likely to remain the
mainstay of the economy for quite some time to come. Further increases in
coffee production and improvement in quality seem technically and economically
feasible, and could enable Burundi to increase its production and foreign
exchange earnings.
10.       Burundi's external trade is seriously hampered by high transport
costs. Goods are largely transported to and from the Indian Ocean, a
distance of about 1,400 km. Internal transport is costly, as the country's
national highway network is in poor condition because of insufficient mainte-
nance, and these factors limit exports to commodities which have high value



- 3 -
relative to weight. Other economic infrastructure is also insufficiently
developed; electricity and tap-water are available in only two cities,
Bujumbura and Gitega. The draft second Five Year Plan provides for projects
in infrastructure amounting to about $55 million, aiming particularly at
improving the country's road network, organization of the transport sector
and urban development. Investments in tourism, manufacturing and trade
would amount to about $12 million.
11.       When Burundi, a former Belgian dependency, became independent in
1962, it was faced with the need to build a new administration and to
strengthen educational institutions to meet the manpower requirements of
the economy. Although the expanding educational facilities and the scholar-
ships provided by external assistance have had encouraging results, the
country is still very short of competent and experienced technicians and
managers. Educational programs are insufficiently geared to meeting the
country's technical manpower requirements in agriculture, industry and
public utilities, and the country still relies heavily on foreign technical
expertise to meet the shortage of skilled people. To adapt education to
the country's needs for agricultural and technical skills, the Government
is preparing a reform of the educational system.
12.       The possibilities for economic and social improvement in Burundi
rest principally with the agricultural sector. Because of favorable ecology
and climate, the country can produce a variety of agricultural commodities,
ranging from cotton, rice and palm oil in the lower valleys, to wheat, bar-
ley, potatoes and tea in the higher regions, while conditions in the middle
elevations are very good for coffee. In the most densely populated areas,
yields per hectare can be increased, and once the tsetse fly is eradicated
in the North-East of the country, more land can be brought under cultivation.
Animal husbandry and fishing can also be substantially improved. However,
the realization of the potential depends on how far the Government, hitherto
preoccupied with a precarious law and order situation, can implement programs
such as extension services, improvement of planting materials, distribution
of fertilizers and marketing.
13.       Since the mid-1960's, the Government has made substantial efforts
to improve its budgetary situation. The current budget deficit of the late
1960's was considerably reduced and turned into a surplus of about $0.3 mil-
lion in 1970. In 1971, the situation improved further and Government sav-
ings were estimated at about $2.9 million. This development was brought
about in part by higher incomes and revenues derived from favorable world
coffee prices. The budget continued to be assisted by foreign grants amount-
ing to about $0.4 million annually, and by considerable technical assistance
in filling Government positions. Between 1966 and 1971, Government revenues
steadily rose by 11% annually. Although there was a rapid increase in
ordinary expenditures because of the need to create a new Government ad-
ministration and to expand social and education facilities, the increase was
kept to an average annual rate of six percent. In 1972, however, ordinary
expenditure grew by over 19% and Government savings amounted to only $0.4
million. In 1973, there was a relatively small deficit on the current budget.



14.       Burundi's capacity to finance public sector investments is limited.
In 1970, foreign capital aid financed about 90% of capital formation in the
public sector. As private investments contributed little to domestic in-
vestment in the monetized sector of the economy, external assistance played
a crucial role in the growth of Burundi's capital assets.   In line with the
increase in foreign aid, gross investments increased from $6.4 million in
1965 to about $15 million annually in 1970-1971. Because of the lack of
domestic resources in the foreseeable future, Burundi is likely to remain
heavily dependent on external capital and technical assistance for the bulk
of its development effort.
15.       Official development assistance was estimated at $19.4 million in
1972. Belgium contributed about 33%, and UN agencies, IDA and the European
Development Fund another 53%. Technical assistance amounted to about $9.8
million, while the aid contribution to public sector projects reached about
$9.1 million in addition to program aid of some $0.4 million. In the 1965-
1971 period, total foreign capital aid amounted to about $53 million, of
which $45 million were in grant form. On December 31, 1972, Burundi's ex-
ternal public debt amounted to $6.9 million, excluding undisbursed amounts.
Of this the Bank and IDA together hold 61%. Debt service averaged 4.5% of
export earnings during 1971/72 with the Bank Group receiving 34% of service
payments. By 1980 the Bank Group can still expect to be holding an equally
high proportion of debt and debt service. The high share of debt owed to the
Bank and IDA is largely due to the fact that mDst other aid is given on grant
terms. Notwithstanding the low debt service ratio, the country is too poor
to justify any borrowing on conventional terms. External aid should finance
a high proportion of total projects costs, including local expenditure, and
be on grant or near grant terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BURUNDI
16.       Before independence, Burundi and neighboring Rwanda formed the
Belgian Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, to which the Bank made a loan of
$4.8 million in 1957, with the guarantee of Belgium. The loan, which was
fully disbursed at independence in 1962, financed the improvement of the
Bujumbura-Muramuya road in Burundi and the expansioni of the lake port of
Bujumbura, the present capital of Burundi. Repayment of the principal
of the loan and the payment of interest are being made by Burundi.
17.       Burundi has been a member of IDA since 1963. Th.ree credits
have been made to Burundi, totalling $3.28 million. In Mare. 1966, a first
credit of $1.1 million was made to the Governent of Burundi for Regideso,
the agency responsible for water and power supply, for the rehabilitation
and extension of the water supply system of Bujumbura. During implementation
of the project, funds were also allocated to Burundi by the UNDP, WHO and
Germany for improvement in Regideso's management and staffing. The IDA
project was completed in March 1973 and has provided Bujumbura with an ample
and safe water supply but failed in extending the distribution system. The



Government and Regideso have still not fulfilled a number of contractual
obligations stipulated in the credit agreement and supplementary letter,
such as increasing tariffs, improving Regideso's management and staff, and
carrying out regular auditing of Regideso's accounts. The last supervision
mission took place in March 1973 upon completion of the project. At that
time Regideso's overall cash situation was acceptable. Basic technical and
administrative operations, such as accounting and billing, were adequate, but
management and training of staff remained weak. To improve this situation,
Germany will continue to provide technical assistance. During future missions
to Burundi, we will continue to urge the Government and Regideso to fulfill
their obligations.
18.       The second credit of $1.8 million was made in April 1969, for the
improvement of coffee production by smallholders. Execution of this project
is satisfactory. A highway engineering credit of $380,000 was made in
June 1970, to help finance the detailed engineering of the Bujumbura-Nyanza
Lac road and a highway maintenance study. The proposed project results from
this study. A summary statement of the pre-independence Bank Loan and the
IDA credits is attached as Annex II.
19.       While the directions of future development in Burundi remain
clouded by overriding ethnic and political questions, in planning future
IDA projects in the country we intend to focus on projects which would
benefit the larger and poorer segment of the population. Preparation is
under way for a mixed farming project, with a heavy component for the im-
provement of coffee production. The project would consist of assistance
to peasant farmers in the form of extension services, fertilizers, etc.
In cooperation with the UNDP and FAO, we are planning to assist in the im-
provement of traditional lake fishing. For the longer term future, we
hope to assist in the diversification of the education system, with empha-
sis on technical education. The present project includes a component for
the study of future transport needs in Burundi, particularly to assist the
agriculture sector and this may be the basis for future IDA lending in
transport.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
20.       Burundi's terrain is very rugged, making transport difficult.
There are no railways; road construction is costly, and this has hampered
the development of the road system. The economy, however, is heavily de-
pendent on roads for transportation in areas not served by Lake Tanganyika.
Almost all export-import traffic is by lake from Bujumbura to Kigoma in
Tanzania, and then by rail via the East African Railways to Dar-es-Salaam on
the Indian Ocean. While there are other routes both to the Atlantic and
the Indian Oceans, they are less reliable and more costly. An international
airport at Bujumbura serves large jet aircraft, and there are six small
airstrips scattered throughout the country.



-6-
21.       Although the highway network is extensive, totalling about 5,500
km, it consists mostly of low standard earth and gravel roads. Only a small
part of the network is paved. Some 3,000 km are maintained by the Director-
ate of Roads and Bridges in the Ministry of Public Works. The remaining
2,500 km carry very little traffic and their maintenance is the responsibility
of local authorities. The bulk of the network is in very poor condition be-
cause of inadequate maintenance.
22.       The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for the design, con-
struction and maintenance of national roads. Two departments within the
Ministry deal with various aspects of road administration. The Department
of Roads and Bridges (DPC) executes minor construction works, carries out
routine maintenance, and is creating a Mechanical Services Division to main-
tain its own equipment fleet. The Department of Planning and Design engineers
works carried out by the DPC and administers all construction contracts. The
Department of Transport (STB) provides public transportation, and purchases,
maintains and repairs Government equipment.
23.       The Ministry of Public Works suffers from a shortage of technically
trained personnel. The only Burundi engineers dealing with roads are the
Directors of the DPC and the Department of Planning and Design. Some tech-
nical staff are provided by Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany,
France and FED. In the next five years, only about ten Burundian nationals
now studying abroad are expected to join the Ministry. Thus, the DPC would
remain dependent for some time on foreign technical staff to strengthen its
highway administration. The proposed project includes funds for the train-
ing of Burundian personnel, which should help to alleviate the situation.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Maintenance Project,
Burundi" (No. PTR - 109c) dated January 25, 1974, is being circulated
separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided as Annex III.
25.       The project is based on a highway engineering and maintenance
study financed by IDA Credit S11-BU ($380,000), carried out in 1970 and up-
dated in 1973. As a result of this study, a highway construction and mainte-
nance project was appraised in October 1971. This project included, inter
alia, the reconstruction to paved standard of the Bujunbura-Mutambara road
section and limited improvement of the Mutambara-Nyanza Lac road section.
A credit of $8.9 million was negotiated for this project in April 1972, but
presentation to the Executive Directors was postponed due to the outbreak
of the civil war. In the fall of 1972, following the abatement of violence
and in the spring of 1973, missions were sent to determine whether the re-
construction and improvement of the Bujumbura-Mutanbara-Nyanza Lac road,



-7-
which serves the area where fighting was heaviest, were still economically
justified. The missions f9und that there was a decrease in economic activity
in the area and that construction of the road to the original standard was
not economically justified at this time. IDA, therefore, proposed to the
Government to finance only limited improvement of the Bujumbura-Matambara-
Nyanza Lac road, and to defer financing of the reconstruction to paved standard
of the Bujumbura-Matambara road section until traffic volumes justified it.
The Government, however, attaches great importance to a complete reconstruction
of the road section immediately and would prefer to seek alternate sources of
financing to carry it out rather than postponing the reconstruction until IDA
would finance it, and to limit the present IDA project to highway maintenance
and preinvestment studies. Accordingly, in December 1973, a revised draft
credit agreement was negotiated with the Government.
The Project
26.       The project consists of the following:
a.   implementation of a four-year highway maintenance program;
b.   the provision of consultants' services for
(i) preparing a masterplan for road development;
(ii) feasibility study and detailed engineering of the
Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road (106 km) and other roads
identified under (i) above; and
(iii) updating the consultants' report financed by Credit
S11-BU; and
c.   refinancing of Credit S11-BU.
Highway Maintenance Program
27.       Some eight to ten years will be required to establish a highway
maintenance organization capable of keeping the road network adequately
maintained. The four-year program (1974-1977) to be carried out under the
present project will be the first phase of the long-term program and will
concentrate on providing the required facilities and on training a nucleus
of able technicians and skilled laborers on which a strong organization
can be built. The project includes:
a.   the provision of technical assistance to the DPC, including
the training of DPC personnel at all levels;
b.   the purchase of maintenance and workshop equipment, spare
parts, fuel and materials;
c.   the construction of a mechanical workshop and store
room at Bujumbura and a small maintenance depot at
Gitega.



The Government has agreed that it will, during the first six months of calendar
year 1977, consult with the Association on the definition of the second phase
of the maintenance program expected to begin in 1978, and oa the financing
revuired for its execution.
(i) Technical Assistance and Training
28.       At present, the DPC technical staff is limited to the Director, a
few technicians, and four German-financed experts who are helping organize
the new Mechanical Services Division and supervising the ongoing construc-
tion of the mechanical workshop. Germany has agreed to extend these services
until the end of the project period and, under the project, the German team
will assist in establishing and operating the new equipment repair services.
The UNDP has agreed to finance six additional experts, to be provided by
consultants, who will be assigned to DPC headquarters and to road maintenance
operations. They will assist in establishing five small maintenance units
which will undertake the maintenance of about 1,400 km of selected roads
over the four-year period of the project.
29.       In addition to filling various posts at headquarters, the TJNDP
consultants' team and the German technical assistance team will train Burundi
counterparts as they become available. During the program period, two newly
graduated engineers or technicians are expected to join the DPC annually, and
they will be absorbed into its organization. The experts will also provide
on-the-job training of technical personnel, with the consultants being
responsible for training inspectors, foremen and equipment operators, and
the German experts, for the training of mechanics.
30.       The training needs of the department are, however, much more ex-
tensive than can be met by the civil engineers included in the above con-
sultantts teams. Meeting these needs will necessitate a comprehensive
program in technical education for upgrading unskilled and semi-skilled
laborers through classroom and practical training. Existing facilities
in Burundi for technical education comprise a technical school in Bujumbura
including a School of Public Works, and a training center in Gitega which
is supported by Belgian technical assistance. With some adaptation, the
present facilities can be utilized to satisfy the training requirements of
the maintenance program. The project, therefore, includes the services of
a training expert for three months to evaluate the existing training facil-
ities and needs, and to develop a curriculum for training maintenance per-
sonnel in coordination with the on-the-job trainitg to be provided by DPC
headquarters' staff. The project also includes a provisional allowance for
the employment of instructors and the purchase of training equiphent. The
Government has agreed that, upon receipt of the training expert's recommenda-
tions, it will review these with the Association and agree upon the specific
allocation of funds for training under the project.



- 9-
(ii) Equipment and Materials
31.       Under the first phase of the maintenance program, approximately
1,400 km of the most important roads will receive regular maintenance, Of
these, the roads in the poorest condition (about 400 km) have been selected
for minor betterment works and regravelling. All operations which can be
done properly by hand will continue to be carried out by manual labor but
efficiency would be increased by providing the maintenance crews with light
trucks. In addition, to assure the required quality standard equipment will
be provided for works which are most appropriately carried out by machine.
For these works five small mechanized units will be established and equipped
under the project: three for grading road surfaces, one for regravelling, and
one capable of minor earthworks and improvement of drainage facilities. The
project also provides for the purchase of spare parts for the new equipment
and for some of the existing equipment, as well as for the purchase of fuel
and materials required to carry out deferred maintenance and road betterment
works.
(iii) Buildings
32.       Buildings to be constructed under the project include the mechanical
workshop at Bujumbura, on which construction has begun, an annex to the work-
shop containing a storeroom for spare parts, and a small maintenance depot in
Gitega for equipment maintenance and minor repairs. The Federal Republic of
Germany is financing construction and equipment of the workshop itself; IDA
will finance construction of the workshop annex at Bujumbura and the mainte-
nance depot at Gitega, and the renovation and equipment of the School of
Public Works in Bujumbura.
Preinvestment Studies
33.       While the maintenance works to be carried out under the present
project will, for the most part, improve the road system adequately to serve
present traffic requirements, more substantial works will be required on cer-
tain road sections over the next five years if they are to serve the country's
needs. The project, therefore, includes the provision of consultants to
assist the Government in identifying and preparing future road projects.
The consultants will carry out a feasibility study, followed by detailed
engineering if justified, of the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road (106 km) which
serves a densely populated area where several agricultural programs are
underway including an IDA-financed coffee project (Credit 147-BU). Con-
sultants will also prepare a masterplan for further road development in
Burundi, identifying priorities and proceeding with additional feasibility
studies of specific roads after agreement between the Government and the
Association.
Execution of the Project
34.       The DPC in the Ministry of Public Works will be responsible for
execution of the project and will be assisted by the experts to be provided
by the UNDP and Germany. The consultants' team at headquarters will pre-
pare the bidding documents for the mechanical equipment and materials, and



- 10 -
will assist in the evaluation of bids.   The Government has undertaken to
allocate to the DPC, beginning in 1974, a sufficient amount of money to permit
it to carry out its highway maintenance program; this is estimated to be
about $1 million annually for recurrent costs, of which about $688,000 would
be for personnel costs and the balance for fuel, materials and spare parts
neeced for normal maintenance operations.
Financing Plan
35.       The total capital cost of the project is estimated at $8.40 million
with a foreign exchange component of about $7.21 nillion. The proposed IDA
credit of $5.0 million would cover $4.82 million of the foreign cost and
$180,000 of the local cost. The IDA credit would finance equipment as well as
spare parts, mterials and fuel needed for tite improvement of the project
roads; the construction and equipment of a smal31 mechaniical workshop annex,
a storeroom and a small maintenance depot; the renovation and equipment of thie
School of Public W4orks in Bujumbura; feasibility studies and detailed engineer-
lng of the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road (106 kli) and other preinvestmnent studies
to be agreed upon as well as the preparation of a highway masterplan. The
amount disbursed and outstanding under Credit S11-BU which financed the feasi-
bility and engineering studies and the preparation of the original project,
would be refinanced under the new credit.   In addition, an amount of about
$10,000 for a review by consultants of alternative construction methods for
the Bujumbura-Mutambara-Nyanza Lac road carried out in the beginning of 1973,
would be retroactively financed.
36.       The UNDP would provide $1.05 million to finance six consultants to
be seconded to the DPC.  The Federal Republic of Germany woulkd grant the
equivalent of $1.33 million for the construction of the workshop at Bujumbura
and for its management by four Ger-man experts.  Belgium woula grant the
Government of Burundi an anount of $400,000 to cover part of t1he locaL c ost.
The Government of Burundi would contrtibtte :620,000 for .lhe balInc.e of local
cost, including $200,000 for duties an-l taxes and $490.CO00  for cowiterpart
personnel, logistical assistance and otrerials.
DisDursement and Procurement
37.       The credit would be disbursed over a period 0f ~iixe years against
100% of foreign expenditures for conlsultants' serv:ies, eu:p-   t . and spare
parts; and 87% of total expenditures for the construction of buildings antio
for fuel and materials.  The outstanR ing bziaa ce ao  ered r  S- TUa -:ab out
$380,000, including exchange adjustments) would r,e refinane:ei under the
credit.
38.       Contracts for materials atnd eqaipmen- financed b-; tche 1DAi credit
which are expected to cost more than S090Q, w;u,ld i-c awarded under inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance Wit-h1- IDA Gui delinEs.  Contracts
expected to cost less thar $10,000 would be ad%xe-tised lo-al>v   S-uppliers
otf mechanical equipment would be required to proiAde satisfactory after-
sa'les and spare parts service.



Economic Benefits
39.       The investments in the road maintenance program would prevent
further deterioration, and improve the condition of the road network,
thereby reducing vehicle operating costs. The program is expected to
yield a return of about 13% and would also improve the efficiency of the
DPC.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vrided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement reflects the normal pattern
for credits for highway maintenance projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       In formulating this proposal it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed credit remains fully
justified.
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Credit No. 147-BU    Coffee Improvement Project: $1.8 million of April 11, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project consists of the improvement in yield and quality
of coffee from about seven million existing coffee trees owned
by some 4400 smallholders in a 4400 ha area. The project
provides for: the establishment of a Project Department with-
in the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Burundi (OCIBU),
responsible for project management; improvement and mainten-
ance of about 80 existing communal pulping centers and the
construction and maintenance of four pulping factories;
improvement of road infrastructure; procurement and dis-
tribution of equipment and planting materials; and train-
ing of staff for extension services and coffee processing.
The project also includes a soil study and a coffee tree
census to prepare for a second phase of the project. The
project is in its fourth year and the quality of the csoffee
produced has improved. A first pulping factory was built
at Mushonge. The three remaining factories are under
construction. Due to a slow start of the project and civil
strife in April-May 1972, project implementation has been
delayed by about one year and a half. The closing date of
the credit has therefore been postponed until June 30, 1975.
2/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.
