MEORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TRE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A TAX COMPUTERIZATION PROJECT
1.        I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the
equivalent of US$63 million to help finance a Tax Computerization Project. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
20 years, including five years of grace.
2.        Background.  Insufficientt govarnment revenues and the inabflity to
borrow on commercial markets seriously constrain the construction of
infrastructure critical for the country's economic development. Taxes are the
main source of government revenue, accounting for 83X cf total revenues in
1991. Tax collection mainly involves the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and
the Bureau of Customs (BOC), both within the Department of Finance (DOF).
3.        Tax Reforms.  Iwportant procedural reforms for both BIR and BOC have
been carried out since 1986, increasing administrative efficiency and
rationalizing tax systems. With LfF technical support, these efforts
accelerated during the past two years and have paved the way for
computerization. The tax administration, although constrained by its lack of
adequate computer facilities, tripled tax collections between 1986-1991, (from
065.6 billion to f183.4 billion), while the tax/GDP ratio incre_sed from 9.8X
in 1984 to 12.5X in 1987 and 14.82 in 1991.
4.        BIR Tax Reform. BIR reforms include: (a) establishing a unique tax
identification number (TIN) for every taxpayer, (b) introducing a new system
where taxes can be paid at banks, (c) establishing a final withholding tax on
compensation income and (d) developing pilot VAT software. Particularly
Important has been the approval of new legislation that: (a) requires about
1,500 large taxpayers to file returns and process all their tax transactions in
one revenue district office (RDO); (b) establishes monthly VAT returns for
large corporations and (c) increases penalties for tax evasion (including
imprisonment). Additional improvements are being implemented by BIR, and have
been included in the design and specifications of the new computerized systems
or in the project Action Plan (para. 14).
5.        BOC Tax Reform. BOC has also made significant reforms. It introduced
computer systems to clear manifests, simplified customs forms, strengthened the
review systems, introduced internal audit for all taxpayers and implemented the
TIN system. Moreover, since early 1992, a comprehensive import supervision
scheme contracted with the Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) was extended
to all countries trading with the Philippines. Satisfactory progress is being
achieved in completing other improvements identified by the IMF, including:
supervising bonded warehouses, assessing duties and taxes, controlling bank
remittances to the Treasury, compiling and exchanging information on importers
and exporters. Medium-term measures include the use of the GATT valuation
system to replace the home consumption valuation system used now. All these
reforms are incorporated in the procedures and systems specified for the new



-2-
computer system (NCS). The Action Plan includes target dates for approving
legislation, which has been certified by the President and approved in second
reading in Congress, simplifying import clearance procedures, increasing
penalties for smuggling and consolidating customs tax legislation.
6.        The system by which taxes are processed is slow, inefficient and
unable to cope even with the present tax volume. Currently, only a fraction of
the individual and corporate tax returns are computer-procesjed. There is
little cross-checking, even of computGr-processed returns, and collection and
compliance verifications are rudimentary. Because most taxes are still handled
manually, delays occur in processing tax returns, which affect tax compliance,
collection statistics and the management of the tax system. Tax administration
is also hindered by obsolete ^omputer software.
7.        The Government has recognized that an efficient and equitable tax
administration system is the basis of sound economic development and social
stability, and has placed very high priority on improving tax revenues and
collection management througb a decentralized system. The proposed project
would support these reforms by providing an integrated computerized system of
tax administration.
S.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank foerAtios=. Very few projects have
been completed by the Bank in this sector. The proposed project reflects the
current experience from a few projects that are under preparation and
supervision and the experience of a similar project in Thailand, particularly
regarding: (a) separating the tax improvements and computerization from other
projects; (b) selecting carefully the team responsible for developing the
software; (c) carrying out adequate tax administration reforms prior to the
computerization;  and  (d)  specifying  the  basic  information  technology
accurately, but allowing for creative improvements by the hardware vendors and
software application developers.
9.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank provided assistance for
project  preparation  and  mobilized   technical  assistance   to  support
administrative, procedural and legal reforms to improve tax administration and
ensure successful computerization. Procurement of the required hardware and
software is technically complex and would substantially benefit from Bank
experience in similar projects and the use of a transparent evaluation
methodology. The proposed project will establish a modern tax administration
which, in line with the Bank's lending strategy for the Phillppines, would
increase government revenues, support improved fiscal policies and ensure that
tax collection is efficient and equitable, by distributing the fiscal burden
fairly among Filipinos. Bank involvement in the project will also ensure that
adequate priority is given not only to the commissioning of hardware and
software, but to the implementation of other institutional and organizational
improvements, technology transfer and staff development.
10.       Prolect Objectives. The main objective is to support improvements in
tax administration by providing technical assistance, staff training, hardware,
software, priority equipment and facilities. This will result in m e efficient



-3-
and faster processing of revenues and improve access to, and auditability of,
tax records.
11.      EProegt Dencrigtion.  Tha project would establish a computerized and
integratted tax administration system to process all taxes, by providing the
hardware, tax software, complementary equipment, training, initial operational
support and technical assistance to establish a modern tax collection system
for BIR and BOC. It includes the following components:
(a) Provision of computer hardware and software to establish a tax collection
system for BIR, comprising, Inter alla: (a) a mainframe computer
integrating BIR's tax information systems; (b) computing facilities,
communication and data-entry systems at about 19 BIR regional offices and
about 44 BIa district offices; and (c) software for all taxes administered
by BIR (income, excise, withholding and VAT);
(b) Provision of computer hardware and software to establish a tax collection
system for BOC, comprising, Inter alla: (a) two main computers for
software development and for integrating all tax data at the Office of the
Commissioner of BOC; (b) microcomputer systems for the Manila Port and its
Food Terminal Inc., Manila International Container Port, Batangas Port,
Cebu Port, Manila International Airport and Cebu International Alrport;
(c) microcomputer systems for integrated processing of expori-relate6
taxes; and (d) customs tax software.
(C) Priority office equipment and utility vehicles for BIR and BOC and
laboratory equipment for BOC to operate and manage the tax systems;
(d) Training of BIR and BOC staff; and
(e) Technical assistance for project implementation ar- for the required
reorganization of BIR and BOC.
12.       Prolect ImnIementati n. The proposed project would be carried out by
BIR and BOC with the support of consultants. Project costs are estimated at
US$92.4 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$63 million equivalent
(68X) and taxes and duties estimated at US$5.7 million equivalent. The total
financing required, including interest during construction, is US$106.2
million, of which the Bank would finance US$63 million, (592 of the total). Of
the US$63 million loan, US$42.7 million would be allocated to BIR and US$20.3
million to BOC. The remaining costs would be financed by budgetary allocations.
Government has already included a total allocation of 0127 million for BIR and
9100 million for BOC in the 1993 budget. Retroactive financing of up to US$6
million would be provided for project expenditures incurred after January 31,
1993. The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, along with the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Sank Group operations in the Philippines
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11355-PH, dated March 31, 1993 is being distributed
separately.



-4-
13.       PxoJect  Sustainability.    The project  is sustainable,  employing
technologies which are widely and satisfactorily used in the Philippines by
other private and public institutions. Operations and management would be
supported by turnkey cintractors during the first five years and by pr.rsonnal
who will be extensively trained under the project.
14.       Agreed Actions. The approval of key legislation has been completed
satisfactorily (para. 4). The approval of additional legislation is targeted in
the project Action Plan. Also, to ensure that this technically complex project
is properly implemented, BIR ar.d BOC wou'.d es_ablish and staff a Project
Implementation Unit and appoint consultants to supervise project implementation
as conditions for loan effectiveness. Assurances were obtained from Government
at negotiations that: (a) a reorganization study for PIR and BOC would be
completed by May 31, 1995; (b) adequate local counterpart funds for the project
would be Approved annually; and (c) BIR and BOC would implement in a timely
manner an Action Plan. The Action Plan sets targets Inter a&la for: (a)
completion of legislation; (b) implementation of improved procedures; (c)
procurement, awarding and implementation of the turn-key contracts; (d)
strengthening the informatics staff; (e) implementing a reorganization study;
and (f) bidding and awarding contracts for non-computer equipment.
15.       project Bnefts. The project would substantially increase government
revenues which are critical for the country's economic development. Increasing
tax revenues would be a particularly important factor in reducing the fiscal
deficit and debt burden faced by Government. The computerized system would
Improve tax administration and collection, thereby increasing efficiency,
effectiveness and equity. The project has already been instrumental in
improving tax procedures, regulations and legislation through technical
assistance provided during project preparation. In the future, it would help to
decentralize the processing of tax returns, improve access to tax records,
promote auditability at each level, and provide adequate taxpayer records. The
new system is expected to considerably increase revenues from taxpayers who
currently avoid or underpay the required taxes: estimates suggest that tax
evasion could be as high as 30X-50. Even if only 22Z of these taxes are
collected after computerization, the tax/GDP ratio will increase to 191, which
is comparable to ratios in several ASEAN countries. The project benefits have
been demonstrated by the recent but limited coLputerization of the VAT system
in two pilot revenue districts, which increased their tax collections by 401.
16.       It is impossible to estimate an economic rate of return for the
project, since its main result would be the transfer of revenues resulting from
improved procedures. However, the project is extremely cost-effective in
financial terms and even if the project benefits are assumed to be achieved
gradually until the year 2000, the benefit-cost ratio will range from 47 to 61,
depending on the discount rate used (for discount rates between 101 and 201).
Project expenditures would be recovered in just one year by a less than 11
increase in tax revenues.
17.       Iisks. The main risks are associated with the procuremont process. In
general, the award of large contracts for computer hardware and software is
technically complex, controversial and subject to political pressure. In
addition, the project's success would depend on the quality of the software and
hardware provided. These risks have been minimized in the proposed project
through the design of rigorous selection requirements and a transparent system



-5-
for procurement, under a turn-key contract. While little risk is involved with
overall project implementation, given the qualifications proposed for the two
turn-key contractors, there is still a risk that BIR and BOC may not be Able to
retain adequately trained and qualified staff to operate the much-expanded
computerized tax system.   However, this risk is lessened by the massive
training programs included in the project (which provide for expected staff
attrition), by the supplier initially operating the system and by the potential
to extend this assistance, if needed.
18.       Recomendati.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
