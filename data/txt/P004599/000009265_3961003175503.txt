Tax Computerization Project
Loan and Project Summary
Bormwerw   Republic of the Philippines
Amount:    US$63 million equivalent.
Terms:      20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Er>ks
Description: The project would establish a computerized integrated tax administration system to
process all taxes, by providing the hardware, tax software, related data-entry
processing equipment, complementary equipment, training, initial operational support
and technical assistance to establish a modem tax collection system for the Bureau of
Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC).
BeRfitS
and Rislks: The project will substantially increase government revenues, which are critical for the
country's development. The computerized system will improve tax administration and
collection, increasing its efficiency, effectiveness and equity. The project has already
been instrumental in improving tax procedures, regulations and legislation through
technical assistance during project preparation. In the future, it would help
decentralize the processing of tax returns, improve access to tax records, promote
auditability at each level, and provide adequate taxpayer records. The proposed
systems would allow the two Bureaus to cross-check data from other data bases, carry
out on-line inquiries, accelerate the processing of taxes and returns and improve BIR's
and BOC's management  information  system.  The new  system  is expected to
considerably increase revenues from taxpayers who are avoiding or underpaying their
taxes.
The main risk is associated with the procurement process. In general, the award of
large contracts for computer hardware and software is technically complex,
controversial and subject to political pressure. This risk has been minimized in the
proposed project through the design of a transparent system for procurement, under
a turn-key contract. While little risk is involved with overall project implementation,
given the rigorous qualifications proposed for the two turn-key contractors, there is
still a risk that BIR and BOC may not be able to retain adequately trained and
qualified staff to operate the much-expanded computerized tax system. However, this
risk is lessened by the massive training programs included in the project (which
provide for expected staff attrition), by the supplier initially operating the system and
by the potential to extend this assistance, if needed.

Slow, cumbersome process      A new payment system through banks has been successfully

compliance and reconciliation of accounts.
Accounts receivable are high    BIR has decentraized its coUections, is takdng actions to focus on the
(about 12%)                   monitoring of large taxpayers, and the TIN is being applied for aU
tax purposes. Stronger tax enforcement and follow-up is also needed,
which will be facilitated by computerization.
Excessive centralization      RDO and local offices have collection and audit target.. The new
computerized tax administation  will collect aU regional and
provincial data in decentalzed computers, delegating almost
completely the tax enforcement and audit to the local offices.
However, the central mainframe system wiU allow BIR to supervise
each RDO's data transactions and collections.

inadequate tax audits         of the assessments are audited, is three times the recommended
maximum of 30 per staff. This would require a redeployment of staff
from other functions, which will be analyzed and recommended by
the Institutional Study (par. 3.19).
Lack of data exchange         The number of taxpayers is only a fraction of those that are required
to do so because of BIR'slimited capacity to exchange data with
other government data sources. This would identify potendal
taxpayers, including newly registered companies and production data
(Department of Trade and Industry), payers of Social Security (SSS
and GSIS), sales of land and telephone services (Secretary of
Transportation and Communications), civil works contract with
Government (Secretary of Public Works and Highways), interest paid
by financial institutions (Department of Secretary and Central Bank),

and persons travelling overseas (Bureau of Customs).

that most taxpayers will comply voluntarily and

Risks
4.17          The main risk is associated  with the
procurement process. In general, the award of large
contracts for computer hardware and software is
technically complex, controversial and subject to
political pressure. This risk has been minimized in
the proposed project through the design of a
transparent system for procurement, under a turn-
key contract. While little risk is involved with overall
project  implementation,    given   the   rigorous
qualifications   proposed  for  the  two  turn-key
contractors, there is still a risk that BIR and BOC
may not be able to retain adequately trained and
qualified staff to operate the much-expanded
computerized  tax system.  However, this risk is
lessened by the massive training programs included
in the project (which provide for expected staff
attrition), by the supplier initially operating the
system and by the potential to extend this assistance,
if needed.

An Ovaview of the Philippine Tax System
1.         The Philippines raised P182 bilion of tax revenues in 1991 representing 82.44% of
its total public revenues. The major sources of its internal revenues are the income taxes, the
VAT and the excise taxes. Import tariffs are the main trade tax since export taxes were abolished
in 1986. On the aggregate, 68% of the government revenues are raised from indirect taxes. The
tax effort of the Philippines is estimated at 14.52% of its GNP in 1991. This is a significant
improvement considering that its tax effort for the last two decades had been at 12% on the
average. The elasticity has also improved from 0.53% in the '70s to 1.07% from 1986-1990. Tax
collection is thus able to grow proportionately with the increase in national income.
2.         The major features of the tax system of the Philippines are briefly summarized.
Snome Tax
3.         Individual Income Tax The taxation of individuals uses different bases and different
rates depending on income. Fixed-income earners are taxed using the modified gross income
base, i.e., gross income less personal and additional exemptions. The tax rates range from 0% to
35%.
4.         Business and professional income earners are taxed using the simplified net income
tax scheme. Besides personal exemptions, taxpayers are allowed to claim certain deductions.
Expenditures on representation, traveling, advertisements, and bad debts are not allowed to be
claimed as deductions. There are also limitations in claiming interest and charitable contributions
as deductible expenses for income tax purposes. For example, deductions can only be claimed for
contributions which have been made to rehabilitation programs in nationally proclaimed disaster
areas. The applicable tax rates range from 3% to 30% with the structure consisting of only five
tax brackets.
5.         Passive incomes are separately taxed as follows:
(a) Interest income, royalties and prizes exceeding P3,000 are subject to a 20% final
withholding tax on gross.
(b) Capital gains on real properties are imposed a 5% final tax on the gross selling price
or fair market value (which ever is higher). The tax is payable within 30 days from
date of sale. Only individuals are subject to this tax.
(c)   Capital gains on the sale or exchange of shares of stocks which are listed or traded
in any local stock exchange are subject to a tax rate of 0.25%. Both corporate and
individual taxpayers are liable.



- 34 -
Annex 2 - Page 2 of 5
(d)  Net capital gains from the sale or exchange of shares of stocks which are not listed
or traded in the local stock exchange are taxed at 10% if the gains are P100,000 or
less, and 20 percent on the succeeding amounts.
(e)  There is no tax on dividends which are distributed to resident citizens.
6.         Resident aliens who are engaged in trade or business in the Philippines are taxed
like the resident citizens on their incomes from Philippine sources. Non-resident aliens who are
not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines are subject to a 30% tax on their gross
incomes which are received from Philippine sources.
7.         Personal exemptions are given with the intent of exempting families living below the
poverty threshold from income taxation. The exemption levels vary depending on the civil status
of the taxpayer and the number of his dependents. They range from P9,000 for a single
taxpayer to P8,000 for a married taxpayer. An additional exemption of P5,000 can be claimed
for each dependent but the number of dependents who are entitled to the exemption is limited to
four.
8.         Tax Payments. For individual income tax, payment is on pay-as-you-file' basis. The
taxpayer pays the tax due per return at the time of filing. If tax due is more than P2,000, the
taxpayer has an option to pay 50% only and the balance before July 15. In the case of
compensation income, the employer withholds the tax monthly.
9.         For all taxes, income tax deficiency assessments are the result of investigations. Once
the taxpayer is agreeable, the tax is paid with surcharges, interests, and compromise penalties.
Audited income tax returns are conducted to verifiy correctness of the tax paid. Employers are
constituted as withholding agents and their remittances are monitored for compliance.
Delinquent taxpayers will be issued warrants of distraint, levies on properties, annotation of tax
liens and in extreme cases, filing of civil or criminal actions in court.
The Corporate Income Tax
10.        Domestic corporations are taxed on their net worldwide income at 35%.
Subsidiaries of foreign corporations are taxed just like domestic corporations except that any
foreign tax paid on income from foreign sources can be claimed as a tax credit subject to certain
limitations.
11.        Resident foreign corporations which are incorporated under foreign laws but are
engaged in trade or business in the Philippines are taxed on their net income from Philippine
sources at 35%.
12.        Any profit remitted by a branch to its head office is subject to a tax of 15% except
those which are registered with the Export Processing Zone.
13.        Non-resident foreign corporations which are not engaged in trade or business in the
Philippines are taxed only on the gross amount of Philippine source income at 35%.
14.        There are corporate entities which are subject to preferential tax rates, including the
following:
(a) International carriers doing business in the Philippines pay a 2.5% final tax on gross
Philippine billings.



- 35 -
Annex 2 - Page 3 of 5
(b)  Philippine incorporated mutual life insurance companies are subject to a 10% tax o
gross investment income, and net capital gains.
(c)   The gross Philippine income of non-resident cinematographic film owners, lessors or
distributors is subject to a 25% final withholding tax;
(d)  Rentals, lease, and charter fees payable to non-resident owners of vessels chartered
by Philippine nationals are subject to a 4% final withholding tax.
(e)   Offshore banking units are exempt on offshore income but are subject to a 10%
final tax on onshore income.
15.        Tax Payment. For corporate income tax, payment is on 'pay-as-you-file basis.
Taxpayer pays the tax due per return at the time of filing. Unlike individual income tax,
corporations are not given the option to pay 50% of the tax due per return and upon filing the
whole amount of the tax due must be paid.
Other Direct Taxes
16.        The other taxes imposed by government are the estate and donor's taxes and the
real property tax.
17.        The estate tax is imposed on the fair market value of the net estate at rates ranging
from 5% to 35%. Estate tax is self assessing in nature and is paid upon filing, and the tax liability
is initially determined by the executor, administrator or their heir who initially determnes the tax
liability.
18.        The donor's tax is imposed on the transfer of property by gift at rates ranging from
1.5% to 20%. The tax is coUlected when the tax return is filed, which is required within 30 days
from the date of a donation.
19.        The real property tax is imposed and collected by local governments on the assessed
value of lands, buildings, and improvements at rates ranging from 1% to 2%. The assessed value
is a percentage of the market value of the real properties, which is differentiated according to
land use. For example, the assessed value for commercial and industrial lands is 50% of their
market value.
The Value-added Tax
20.        The VAT was introduced in the Philippines in 1988 and replaced a complicated
network of indirect taxes. The VAT replaced the manufacturer's sales tax, the turnover tax, the
advance sales tax on imports, the miller's tax, forest charges, and other percentage taxes on
services. The VAT was designed to eliminate if not to minimize the multiple taxation of goods
and services. It was also intended to enhance efficiency in the allocation of resources.
21.        The Philippine VAT is of the consumption type and covers almost all sales and goods
and services including imports. it is computed using the tax credit method under which input
taxes paid by a VAT trader are deducted from the VAT due. A standard rate of 10% is imposed
with a provision for the zero-rating of exports. Exemptions from the VAT are given to the sale of
agricultural products in their original state, the sale of small firms (i.e., those with annual
turnover of 0200,000 or less), petroleum products, and medical and educational services, among
others.



- 36 -
Annex 2 - Page 4 of 5
22.        An excise tax of 20% is imposed on non-essential commodities in addition to the
VAT. These include jewelry items, perfumes, yachts and other vessels intended for sports.
Ote Pecentage Taxes
23.        There are several goods and services which are still outside the VAT system and are
imposed percentage taxes of varied rates.  These inlude caterers, amusement activities,
franchises, financial transactions, overseas communications common carriers and hotels.
24.        The caterer's tax is imposed on the gross receipts of proprietors or operators of
restaurants and other eating places. The lowest tax rate of 4% is imposed on the sale of food or
refreshments and the highest rate of 25% is applied on food served by establishments within a
racetrack or Jai-alai.
25.        The amusement tax is levied on the gross receipts of operators of amusement places
such as cockpits, nightclubs, professional basketball games, and boxing exhibitions. Rates are
also differentiated with the lowest rate of 15% on boxing exhibitions, and the highest rate of
30% on racetracks. The tax on other amusement places such as theaters is imposed and collected
by local governments at a unitary rate of 30%.
26.        The franchise tax is collected from franchise holders and is also based on gross
receipts. Electric utilities, city gas and water supply are taxed at 2%; telephone, radio or
broadcasting stations are taxed at 3%, and all other franchises are taxable at 5%.
27.        A tax on gross receipts by banks and financial institutions is imposed at varied rates
depending on the maturity of the financial instruments. Instruments with long-term maturity
(over four years) are subject to 1% and instruments maturing within five years are imposed a 5%
tax. Accredited banks accept payment of these taxes while in places where no accredited bank
present payment is through collection agents.
28.        The tax on overseas communications is at 10% which is payable on the amount paid
for overseas messages (telephone, telegraph or other means of communications).
29.        The common carrier's tax is imposed at 3% on transportation contractors and
persons who transport passengers or freight for hire, the common carriers by land, air or water.
30.        The hotel room tax is paid by proprietors or operators of hotels, motels, resthouses,
and resorts at 12%.
The Excise Taxes
31.        The major products which are subject to excise taxation are petroleum, cigarettes
and alcoholic beverages. The excise taxes are imposed besides a 10% VAT.
32.        Petroleum products are taxed with specific taxes which are differentiated. Diesel
fuel oil which is used by public utility vehicles is subject to a lower rate of 00.45 per liter while
higher rates are imposed on regular and premium gasoline at F2.28 and F2.52 per liter of
volume of volume capacity, respectively. Liquified petroleum gas and bunker fuel oil are exempt
from excise taxation. Specific taxes shall be paid within 15 days after removal of petroleum
products from the place of production.



- 37 -
Annex 2 - Page 5 of 5
33.        The tax rates on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages are also varied and
differentiated. The tax rate on locally manufactured cigarettes bearing a foreign brand is 55%,
and is 45% for other locally manufactured cigarettes. An excise tax of 60% attaches to beer.
Distilled spirits and wines are subject to fixed tax rates with the highest rate of P26.00 being
imposed on sparkling wines. On locally manufactured products, manufacturers make deposit for
VAT, specific tax or inspection fee, as the case may be. Before removal of goods from place of
production, the taxpayer determines the amount of taxes due which is verified by the revenue
officer assigned to each factory.
34.        Automobiles are subject ad valorem rates ranging from 15% to 100% of the
manufacturer's selling price besides the VAT. Payment on collection of ad valorem and specific tax
respectively on automobiles is made upon removal from the place of production.
Custom Duties
35.        Custom duties are imposed on imported goods according to their classification under
the Tariff and Customs Code. Before the Tariff Reform in 1991, the duties were generally ad
valorem with a maximum rate of 50%. Under the Tariff Reform Program, the rates will be
gradually reduced over a five-year period starting in 1991 with the maximum rate at 30%.
Other Minor Taxes
36.        The documentary stamp tax requires affixing a documentary stamp to some
documents. Where the tax is substantial, the tax is paid directly. Other taxes are also imposed
under special laws include the mining tax, travel tax, immigration tax, and motor vehicle fees.
The latter group contributes only about 3% to total revenues.

Tax Computerization Project
Non-Computer Equipment and Services
1.         Complementary equipment supporting efficient tax collection and strengthening tax
administration is also included in the proposed project. This equipment is particularly critical to
provide adequate communication between tax collection offices, and to inform and train the staff
and the taxpayers. The equipment would be particularly critical for the successful implementation
of the substantial changes in regulations, procedures, forms, organizational systems and working
requirements for the tax administration staff.
Bureau of Internal Revenue
2.         The key equipment that has been prioritized for BIR is shown in Table 1 and is
explained below.
3.        Information and Training EquipmenL The changes in systems, policies and
procedures require the conduct of seminars and conferences to inform, educate Dromptlv. (a) the
Bureau's personnel; (b) the taxpaying public, and (c) other entities directly and indirectly
affected by the changes.
4.         To provide adequate and effective training and ensure understanding of the new
systems and procedures, BIR would use the following equipment: (i) an audio visual van with
VHS camera, video projector and video screens; (ii) overhead projectors and sound systems; (iii)
the expertise of production consultants will be needed to prepare and coordinate tax education
campaigns and materials, including videos and training films; (iv) posters and streamers. BIR
audio visual equipment includes only 20 overhead projectors and 102 microphones, which are
insufficient for the disperse and large number of activities and changes required simultaneously.
4.         Tax education and campaigns would be enhanced by establishing Video Education
Counters in the National Office (NO) and Regional Office/s.  Videos on new  tax
procedures/systems would be shown to educate staff and taxpayers.
5.         Printing Requirements. BIR requires huge volumes of printing materials, not only to
provide the required forms to million of taxpayers, but to document all tax measures for more
than five thousand employees directly involved in tax assessment and collection. Updated and
revised information has to be distributed quickly to the staff and the taxpayers. This includes 77
different tax returns and a total of 412 forms (many of these forms would have to be replaced or
revised once the computerization system is in place). Other documents requiring printing and
dissemination are the new tax laws and their implementing regulations, new procedures,
circulares, orders, organizational changes, BIR rulings, Tax Court and Supreme Court decisions
and other news items in the Bureau through Revenue Memorandum Order Administrative Orders,
Revenue Rulings, Revenue Travel Administrative Order, Revenue Special Order, Revenue Audit
Memorandum Order, Revenue Memorandum Circular, and the Unnumbered Memorandum.

Annex 8 - Page 2
6.         Communication EquipmenL Modem office communication equipment is needed for
BIR effectiveness and to transmit data, reports and memoranda between its offices and other
agencies. The proposed facsimile machines would be distributed to selected class A-1 and A
Revenue District Offices.
7.         Transportation. Taxpayers can now file their returns and pay their taxes at any
bank branch of their choice (induding some 80 different branches). These returns with the
bank reports have to be collected daily by the RDOs. BIR does not have adequate vehicles for
this purpose. As shown below, the total number of vehicles in use is 139, which is one per
hundred employees. Moreover, 77% of the utility vehicles and 60% of the cars are more than
10 years old, suffering substantial problems with maintenance, reliability and high fuel costs.
Ten of the proposed 30 utility vehicles are to be allocated to the NO and the other 20 to the
RDOs. These vehicles would also be used by the roving teams who are monitoring the
implementation of the new tax systems. In the ROs and RDOs these vehicles shall be used in
the daily collection of all bank reports and provide technical support to the RDOs.

8.         Other Equipment and Materials. These include air conditioning units to be
installed in the offices of selected RDOs to be computerized, computer research materials and
videos and software training materials which would provide a core technical library for the
reconstituted CISS, allowing self-training and improvement for the computer staff, electronic
diagnosis and maintenance equipment, and repair tools to serve as technical aids in the
maintenance of the computer hardware.
Bureau of Customs
9.         The BOC component of the Tax Computerization Project supports a strengthened
internal administrative capability for the Bureau. This requires more efficient systems and
procedures reducing paperwork and boosting employee productivity.



- 65 -
Annex 8 - Page 3
10.        A parallel effort to this computerization is the Bureau's new emphasis on trade
facilitation. This is a positively oriented strategy to promote trade and exports, in direct
contrast with the previous regulatory approach which primarily stressed revenue generation and
collection enforcement. This trade facilitation not only will increase international trade and
exports, which are critical for the economic development of the country, but would then result
in an increase in the taxes resulting from increased revenues and employment, and higher
corporate profits.
11.        Building Facilities. Existing BOC buildings are totally inappropriate for proper tax
administration even to provide minimum facilities to the taxpayers. There is an urgent need to
modernize BOC's offices, which are presently in varying stages of decay, obsolescence or
disrepair. This indudes antiquated office facilities never intended for tax administration
purposes, dilapidated furniture and partitions, unpainted buildings, leaking roofs, no storage
cabinet for large volumes of paperwork and dysfunctional office layouts.
12.        A minimum rehabilitation of BOC's physical facilities will translate into better
working conditions, improved security, increased staff morale, a better public image and
enhanced service to the taxpayers. The rehabilitation will also provide the required space, and
the electrical and telecommunication wiring requirements needed for the computerization.
13.        Power Generation Backup. The prolonged brownouts in Metro Manila require
power generating back-up for BOC. Otherwise BOC functions are paralyzed, resulting in
substantial delays for the examination of merchandises, the processing of manifests, the
collection of revenues and adding security risks for imported equipment. Currently, BOC has
only one small generator serving the requirements of only a few offices at the Office of the
Commissioner.
14.        Air Conditioning. Most of the air conditioning units of BOC are old, dilapidated
and inefficient and should have been replaced long time ago. In the very hot and humid
conditions of the Philippines, air conditioning equipment is crucial for the proper functioning of
computer equipment. The choice air conditioning equipment depends on the physical
characteristics of each office.
15.        Maintenance Equipment and Tools. There is also a critical need to provide BOC
with a strong internal capability to maintain equipment and physical facilities (including
computer equipment). Useful equipment is set aside or discarded for lack of maintenance and
repair capabilities.
16.        Communications The BOC has a crucial need for equipment improving
communications within the organization, as well as with the public. A key area here is in its
telephone facilities, where modem PABXs are planned to be installed at each of the Metro
Manila offices, and linked together into a private BOC-wide telephone network. This network
will also be used for data and fax transmission purposes. Facsimile machines are also required
for the prompt transmittal of document requiring immediate action. This also reduces
messenger problems, given continuous traffic jams in all areas of Metro Manila, but
particularly near the port.
17.        Detection, Testing and Monitoring Equipment There is an urgent need to improve
security of stored goods and to install equipment that would be a deterrent to smuggling,
collusion and other unlawful acts. This would be achieved by installing surveillance cameras,
infrared equipment and one-way mirrors to supervise security aspect concerning the inspection,



- 66 -
Annex 8 - Page 4
movement and storage of goods. These facilities would also serve for intelligence gathering,
where concrete evidence is necessary for prosecution.
18.        Laboratoy Equipment Most of the inspection of materials and goods is based on
visual inspection. However, basic laboratory equipment is needed to evaluate and identify many
substances and products and properly assess their duties/taxes. Given BOC's inadequate
facilities and the high cost of external laboratories, no testing is usually carried out. The
laboratory equipment will provide BOC with the basic capability to perform independent
analysis of materials for duties and customs control purposes.
19.        Weighing Scales. The assessed value of most imported items depends on their
weight. This requires weighing scales to identify fraudulent declarations and hidden or
undeclared items. High capacity scales (2.5 tons) are needed for weighing large or bulky
shipments. Precision scales (200 grams) are necessary for weighing of jewelry, gems, stones,
or other small articles. BOC owns only one large scale at the NALAL
20.        Money counters are also very important in ensuring quick and accurate counting
of currencies and coins held by BOC cashiers and tellers. These are needed at the Metro Manila
ports and in the Office of the Commissioner.
21.        Document Control Equipment One key control measure in the processing of
import declarations is the perforation of the set of importation documents with a unique
control number, safeguarding against the introduction of spurious documents. However,
because of the limited number of perforating machines available, this step is a major bottleneck.
Additional equipment is needed to provide alternate or parallel processing paths. Similarly,
there is also a need to provide additional stamp and metering machines (required for most
documents) and validating machines to alleviate the document buildup at the processing
stations requiring their use.
22.        Office Equipment Basic office equipment is needed for BOC staff, including
calculators, photocopying machines and typewriters. BOC staff often has to use their personal
calculators for official purposes, and critical photocopies cannot be produced within many
buildings. This requires complex and bureaucratic processes for petty cash requests,
reimbursements and replenishment to pay for external photocopies. Office typewriters are
scarce, old and rundown, requiring major repair or outright replacement.
23.        Microfilming Equipment The BOC is virtually a paper factory, with thousands of
declarations and related documents filed every year, creating piles everywhere and causing
storage and retrieval problems, and fire hazards. Microfilming these critical documents will not
only save space, but will also simplify the document retrieval process, and allow the
maintenance of a duplicate off-site copy of the files for backup purposes. BOC does not have a
microfilming system now, and would be greatly benefit from this capability.
24.        Printing. While BOC uses the services of the Bureau of Printing for large printing,
there is a need for an internal capability for printing short, urgent or specialized documents.
This is important for information dissemination, and for trade facilitation and to prepare the
new form required by the BOC reform program.
25.        Information and Trainig. The two-pronged approach of computerization and
trade facilitation requires the cooperation and support of all concerned. Moreover, to properly
implement the procedural reforms and new computerized systems, massive investments in staff
training should be done. Substantial resources also need to be channeled into an extensive

Annex 8 - Page S
educational campaign to communicate the benefits and effects of these new procedures to the
business community.
26.        At present, BOC has no capacity or equipment to provide such training and
information requirements, which would be critical for the project success. This requires
contracting specialized expertise to develop the initial training and communication programs,
the purchase of audio visual equipment, and the production of leaflets, brochures and manuals.
27.        Besides the audiovisual equipment for information dissemination and training, an
electronic whiteboard is considered important for modem training and to be able to provide
copies of the drawings in the whiteboard to the participants in the meeting.
28.        Security. To effectively carry out the BOC reform programs there is a need to
enforce a physical separation of the BOC processing personnel and the transacting public. This
includes a video display system to inform the brokers and importers of the status of their
documents in process in each port in Metro Manila.
29.        For security and intelligence work, radio transceivers are essential in bring
immediate communications to enforcement personnel. They also provide convenient
communications in mobile locations as weil as areas not covered by telephone lines. They are
indispensable in mounting successful operations against criminal elements, in the deployment of
forces, in intelligence gathering, and in relaying urgent messages to field units. At present,
BOC does not have this capability. Existing radio units used by BOC staff are either personally
owned or borrowed from other government offices.
30.        In addition, there is a need to enhance BOC's security capability within the custom
zone, especially during night time and during the rainy season by the provision of a jeep.
31.        During its operations, the BOC handles a great deal of original and confidential
documents, magnetic media such as diskettes and tapes, and apprehends valuables such as
jewelry and precious stones which need safekeeping. This requires the procurement of safes and
vaults, which are grossly inadequate even for present operations.
32.        Transportation. The transportation of key documents and small items is being
carried out by messengers using public transportation, which is slow, covers only some routes
and locations and results in increased security problems. Motorcycles would be purchased to
allow quicker and more efficient transportation.
33.        Service vehicles and transport vans are included to provide minimum mobility to
BOC staff, particularly for the control of many and disperse warehouses. As BOC becomes more
client oriented, each of its service units needs a utility vehicle for staff transportation. Transport
vans (for training and meetings) will be allocated to a central unit, for sharing among all units.
34.        In the area of seized cargoes, forklifts are essential for the transport and stacking
of these goods in security warehouses. This eliminates security problems experienced using
private-hired forklift operators and limited service hours. BOC also needs its own hauler trucks
to handle the transfer of cargo from the port zones to security warehouses. Lack of this basic
equipment is preventing the immediate transport of seized cargo to security warehouses. As a
result, goods are sometimes subjected to theft and pilferage.

1.        All costs are in begining 1993 prices.
2.        All incremental costs during the first five years are included in the project cosL
Taxes and duties are exduded.
3.        The exchange rate for mid-1993 is estimated at P27.5 per US dollar
4.        The project average useful life is estimated at 7 year. Since different
project components will be completed and in operation between the second and
fifth years, the project useful life is assumed to be commpleted in year 2001. It
should be noted that once non-filers are identiSed and taxes are collected,
it is likely they will be collected thereafter.

Tax Computerization Project
Project Implementation and Supervision
Terms of Reference
Background
1.         The Department of Finance (DOF) has initiated a major institutional improvement
program to increase its efficiency, modernize the tax administration system and meet the
Governmenes need for additional revenues. This reform will culminate with the establishment
of a new computer system (NCS), which will allow processing aU taxes collected by the Bureau
of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC). This will improve tax collection,
provide accurate checking of results and provide on-line information on all tax-related data and
improved customer information and services. After the NCS enters into operation, BIR and BOC
will operate a comprehensive, decentralized database for all their respective taxes.
2.         The NCS indudes all elements required to establish a modem system for tax
coilection, processing and related services for business, income and VAT taxes in all provinces in
the Philippines for the BIR and for the four main entry points for the BOC. It will have the
following components: (a) hardware for the tax administration to process and audit all major
taxes (attached is a description of the minimum configuration to be supplied); and (b)
administrative, financial and management information systems.
3.         The NCS is being procured under two single turn-key contracts (one each for BIR
and BOC), which include hardware, software, communications, initial operation, long-term
maintenance and computer-training programs. Although the NCS vendor will initially operate
the system, NCS operations will be gradually transferred to BIR/BOC over the next three to five
years. Concurrent with implementation of the NCS, large-scale training programs will be
undertaken by both the vendor and BIR/BOC in computer- and tax-related matters.
4.         Consultant support has been included in the project for two closely related items,
for which separate terms of reference are being issued: the Organization of BIR/BOC after the
tax computerization; and project Implementation Support for BIR/BOC (under these terms of
reference).
Supervision of Project Implementation
5.         The NCS will be implemented in phases, which include the provision of hardware
and dissemination of BIR software from the central to the district level and to four different
locations for BOC. BIR/BOC will require assistance from a team of experts to monitor project
implementation, verify the vendor's compliance with specifications for hardware and software,
and provide assistance in all technical matters related to the NCS, in particular to:



- 85 -
Annex 13 - Page 2
(a)  provide advice to the BIR/BOC Project Manager on technical, operational and
implementation issues;
(b)  work closely with BIR/BOCs Project Office staff to ensure a coordinated and
effective project implementation effort;
(c) review and approve all technical, system and procedural documentation, and all
specifications and outputs delivered by the supplier,
(d)  monitor the progress of the vendor as weli as BIR/BOC in implementing the NCS,
evaluate its implementation, and advise on expediting implementation;
(e)  provide expert advice for the review and approval of the supplier's project
inception, organizational and staffing plans;
(f)  advise on changes in the project scope, replacement of staff and/or equipment and
building facilities, changes in the project schedule that may be needed, and initiate
change orders;
(g)  recommend to the Project Director penalties for the supplier's delays or
unacceptable outputs and performance;
(h)  provide liaison and coordination with the supplier,
(i)  participate in Steering Committee meetings to review project implementation and
propose revisions or changes in policies, technical specifications or schedules;
ji) organize the acceptance and support tests for determining compliance with
specifications for hardware, software and communication systems, and the
functionality of the overall system;
Ok)  check invoices presented by the supplier and recommend payments based on
successful operation for the contractually stipulated periods;
Cl)  approve recommendations to put the system modules into production mode;
(m) monitor the efficacy of system implementation and the supplier's operation of the
NCS;
(n)  monitor the incorporation of BIR/BOC's data processing staff into the operation
and management of the NCS, and the smooth transition from the supplier to -he
BIR/BOC; and
(o)  provide periodic reports to the Project Director to monitor and recommend
expediting actions.

Qualifications of the Implementation Specialists
6.        The consultants should have at least ten years of experience in data processing,
and be able to supply references to confirm that they have successfully implemented two major
automation programs in large public sector institutions. Knowledge of taxation modalities and
systems, telecommunication networking, distributed processing, and implementation of
automated processes is a pre-requisite to ensure that the implementation management advice
given to the BIRVBOC is appropriately focused and relevant to the project. The consultants
should also be able to demonstrate prior experience of managing and monitoring the efforts of
contractors supplying, installing and operating goods and services under a turn-key
management contract, and in providing the client organization sound advice to expedite the
project and resolve contractual issues.
7.        Although the study will be contracted under a single contract, separate proposals
should be presented for the costs associated with the BIR and BOC organization study.

tax computerization (these terms of reference) and project implementation support for
BIR/BOC.
Review of the BIR/BOC Organization
5.         The start of NCS operations by end-1994 will call for major changes in the
procedures and systems now used by BIR/BOC. The NCS will affect not only the way in which
tax data are collected, processed and audited, but also the relationships, authority and
responsibilities of the Central, Regional, Area and District Offices. As a result of the NCS, some
existing functions will disappear and new activities and functions will be created at all levels of
the organization. The relationship, management and communications between head and local
offices will be radically different. The reliance on electronic data processing, the large number



- 88 -
Annex 14 - Page 2
of computer specialists required, and the need to provide adequate remuneration to computer
specialists will also be important. Judging from the experience of other countries, it may be
necessary to create a separate Deputy Director or for the electronic data processing (EDP) units
in order to clarify functions and responsibilities and strengthen the EDP administration.
6.          The consultant engaged under these terms of reference should review and
comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the organiational structures and
management of tax collection and EDP in comparable countries, and review and comment on
alternative organizational structures suitable for BIR/BOC
7.          The consultant should work dosely with BIR/BOCs central and local divisions and
staff, and review with the NCS vendor the operational implications of the proposed system on
the staff, their functions and the structure of BIR/BOC.
8.          The  study will analyze  and  propose  recommendations for BIR/BOCs
organizational requirements at the central and local levels to allow for the succesful operation
of the NCS. The specific areas for analysis and recommendations are as follows:
(a)  BIR/BOC existng organzation structure and changes in the organzation required to
manage the NCS and improve its overall operations and effectiveness;
(b)  staff requirements for the various BIR/BOC divisions, the staff needed at each level, and
changes in job descriptions, skill levels, and job grading resulting from introduction of
the NCS;
(c) the operational data flows and procedural framework necessary to effectively operate
the NCS;
5d) the organization and management of EDP activities, functions and tax databases,
including the relationships, authority and responsibilities at the central, regional,
provincial and district levels (if any);
(e)  the relationship between the local level EDP and the local office management;
(f)  the need to establish a separate management group for EDP, its relationship with local
EDP processing offices, and their structure and staffing,
(g) the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a separate core division for VAT
expertise, or other similar specialized functions; and
(h) the measures (including higher grades, provision of bonuses, training programs, and
monetary and non-monetary incentives) that should be adopted by BIR/BOC to engage
and retain qualified EDP staff.
9.          The consultant should provide an Initial Report within two months of his
appointment, describing the main organizational issues, critically reviewing the alternative
organizations used by other countries, and the basic issues and decisions that may be required
at this stage of the study. A Final Report, including BIR/BOCs comments on the Inital Report,
wil be issued within six months of the consultant's appointment.

Desired Qualifications of the Consultant
10.        The experts in the team should have at least a master's degree in business
administration or similar discipline. The consultant should be able to demonstrate prior
experience with at least two organizational studies in the public or private sector, and provide
recommendations and adequate references to confirm the success of such studies. The
consultant should also have extensive experience in taxation systems, adequate exposure to data
processing principles, and be well versed in reviewing organizational structures, evaluating
operational effectiveness, discovering procedural and decision-making botdenecks to be able to
recommended improvements in the BIR/BOC.
11.        Although the study will be contracted under a single contract, separated proposals
should be presented for the cost associated with BIR and BOC organization study.
