MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE 3XECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR A PUBLIC SECTOR TRAINING PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for US$20.8 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed Loaii would be repayable in 20 years
including 5 years of grace at the standard variable interest rate and would
help finance a public sector training project.
2.         Background.  Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) basic strategy of
accelerated and more broad-based development faces two major constraints--the
country's relatively weak institutional capacity and the lack of highly
trained personnel. In general, PNG lacks strong institutional capabilities in
the form of organizational structures, administrative policies and procedures,
and management systems to plan, design, implement and sustain effective
development programs. In response to these limitations, the Government is
currently implementing an institutiona' reform program which encompasses
improved resource management and inves ment programming, new project
development and implementation procedures, strengthened technical assistance
management, improved procurement procedures and the introduction of program
budgeting. These efforts are being assisted by Bank-financed experts and a
study on improving absorptive capacity. However, the impact of improved
planning mechanisms and administrative processes will be greatly reduced
unless well-trained personnel are available to carry through and sustain these
improvements. Thus the Government has also turned its attention to improving
the planning, coordination, and delivery of training.
3.        Major initiatives are being taken in the fields of in-service and
pre-service training. In-service training is widespread in the public sector
and among the larger private firms but is hampered by poor planning and
coordination. The recently approved National Training Policy (NTP) calls for
the Department of Personnel Management to play the major role in promoting,
coordinating, monitoring and evaluating in-service training in the public
sector and for the Department of Labor and Employment to play a similar role
in the private sector. The NTP calls for Three-Year Training Plans to be
submitted to DPM by public sector agencies and to DLE by private firms.
Thirty-six such Plans are currently under review and when reviews are
completed, DPM and DLE will make appropriate recommendations to the National
Training Council. The NTC is being established under the National Training
Policy to formulate overall in-service training policies, set priorities and
estimate training resource needs. The Administrative College (Adcol) which is
the public sector's main in-service training institution, will be strengthened
under the NTP to provide a broader range of practical, skill intensive courses
and to develop the capacity to become a training resources center for research
and consultancy on training issues, curriculum development, training of



- 2 -
trainers, etc. Pre-service training is at present controlled by more than two
dozen agencies and comprises many small, uneconomic training institutions.
This has led to a poorly planned and coordinated system which also suffers
from high unit costs due mainly to its inability to benefit from economies of
scale. To address these issues, a higher education plan has been drafted
which makes recommendations for improving the planning and coordination of
higher education and for a more rational use of institutional capacity. The
plan will be implemented by the Commission for Higher Education which will be
strengthened for the task by expert assistance to be financed by UNDP.
4.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has previously assisted
institutional improvement and personnel training in PNG. It is therefore
well-placed to continue support in these areas and the proposed project is
consistent with previous support. Project design has benefitted from the
lessons learned from prior experience. The Government's ongoing
administrative reform program includes more effective training as a major
ingredient, to be achieved through implementation of the NTP. The key to the
successful implementation of the NTP is the effective performance of DPM, DLE
and Adcol. The proposed project would strengthen the institutional capacity
of these agencies to carry out their roles under the NTP. The project would
also assist in filling important skill gaps by providing overseas training
opportunities in policy, planning and technical fields which are not available
in local institutions.
5.         Proiect Objectives.  The overall objective of the proposed project
is to assist the Government in implementing its program of institutional
reform by supporting implementation of the National Training Policy. More
specific ally, the project wQald strengthen in-service training in the public
and private sectors and increase the supply of specialized high-level
personnel to staff the Government's policy and planning agencies and to help
meet shortages of technical skills. The overall impact of the project would
be to assist in strengthening the management, planning and technical
capacities of the public sector and improve the effectiveness of training in
the private sector.
6.         Project Description.  The project woulds  (a) finance experts,
fellowships, furniture and equipment to support the implementation of tU-
National Training Policy through strengthening DPM's capacity to promote,
coordinate, monitor and evaluate training in the public sector. Strengthen
DLE's capacity to play a similar role in the private sector; (b) finance civil
works, experts, fellowships, furniture, equipment, consumable and teaching
materials to upgrade and reorient the Administrative College towards its new
role as defined under the NTP namely to focus on short, intensive skill
development courses and executive development programs and place greater
emphasis on research, curriculum development and the training of trainers; and
(c) finance an overseas fellowship program for training in policy, planning
and technical fields which at present is not available in PNG.
7.         Each project agency (DPM, DLE and Adcol) would be responsible for
implementing its part of the project under the overall direction of a project
manager. A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) would assist in the overall
coordination of project activities, provide policy advice and resolve major



- 3 -
problems which might arise during project implementation. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. The proposed loan, to be
disbursed over seven years, would finance 902 of total project cost. This
level of cost sharing is based on the increasing needs of PNG for external
assistance which is partly due to the recent oil price increase as PNG is an
oil importirng country. Retroactive financing of US$0.7 million will be
provided for expenditures after December 1, 1990 for civil works, equipment.
fellowships and consultant services. Amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in PNG are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8592-PNG dated December 5, 1990, is
being distributed separately.
8.         Actions Agreed.  The Government has agreed that:  (a) special
attention would be given to recruiting women candidates for overseas
fellowships including the flexible application of grade and position levels
for the award of policy/planning fellowships; (b) a writte-i undertaking would
be given by sponsoring departments that fellows being finunced under the
project would return to their previous positions or to positions within the
departments which were relevant to the training programs undertaken by the
fellows; and (c) consultants will be appointed under a schedule agreed with
the Bank.
9.         Benefits.  The project would assist in the effective implementation
of the NTP. This would lead to higher quality in-service training in the
public sector, which would be of greater relevance to clients' needs and more
efficiently delivered. The project would also increase the supply of trained
high-level personnel which would improve the management, planning, and
technical capacities of key agencies thereby enhancing their performance as
agents of development. The project would also lead tc more effective training
in the private sector.
10.        Risks.  The major risk associated within the project concerns the
capacity of the relatively inexperienced project institutions to implement the
project efficiently. The risk would be reduced through the establishment of a
high-level Project Coordinating Committee and the appointment of an
experienced project manager.
11.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
