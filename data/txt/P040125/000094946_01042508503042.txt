3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective.
The Project's stated objective was to continue to support the Government's poverty alleviation strategy and
to target its investments to the poorest areas and population groups in the country (Ref 1, See Annex 7). It
would contribute to the government's decentralization strategy by building local capacity in project
planning, execution, operations and maintenance of small scale infrastructure and public services. It would
contribute to the longer term goal of sustained poverty reduction through investments in productive projects
designed to stimulate economic activity in poor communities. It would focus on meeting priority needs for
social and economic infrastructure programs, through projects designed with the participation of poor
communities in consultation with local governments and line ministries. The resources for projects would
be allocated based on the poverty map and community survey of basic needs developed by FONCODES
both of which had desegregated data at the district or community level.
Overall, the project objective was clear and consistent with the Bank's CAS. Throughout the first operation,
FONCODES had demonstrated to be an effective instrument to deliver financing for small infrastructure
projects in poor rural areas of Peru. Hence, both the GOP and the Bank decided to proceed with the follow
up FONCODES II operation. The GOP had a clear poverty reduction goal and FONCODES was one of
the key instruments for its achievement. However, the objective statement was somewhat general, i.e. it did
not quantify to what extent it would contribute to the poverty alleviation strategy. As a result, its impact on
poverty reduction was difficult to evaluate in absolute terms.
Actually, the GOP did not have a decentralization strategy leading to empowerment of local govemment.
Indeed, at the time, most sources of tax revenues traditionally available to municipal governments had been
abolished. Therefore, the "decentralization" referred to above was about the delegation of decision-making
authority from FONCODES' central office to regional offices. The role of local government was limited to
promotion and some cofinancing of projects.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Project objective was not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project had two main components: Community Based Subprojects (US$420.7 million total, US$145.6
million IBRD) and Institutional Development (US$7.8 million total, US$4.4 million IBRD). The project
was cofinanced with the IDB with an equivalent loan.
Community Based Subprojects. This component financed two broad categories of community-based
subprojects: social infrastructure and social assistance, and economic infrastructure and productive
activities (productive projects were limited to US$4.3 million of Bank funds). As the need for basic social
services was met and the capacity of the line ministries increased, commnunity demand and the composition
of FONCODES' portfolio was expected to shift gradually to economic infrastructure and productive
activities. FONCODES II was expected to satisfy 100% of the need for primary education infrastructure
(approximately 1,300 projects), about 50% of the need for water and sewerage systems (4,250 projects)
and approximately 20% of the need for electricity (1,250 projects). These projections were based on a
survey of basic needs carried out on 18,000 communities of Peru.
- 2 -



This component was well designed and directly linked to the achievement of the project objective.
FONCODES had a demonstrated capacity to finance community-based subprojects under a project cycle
which had been used during the prior loan and was only to be redesigned in some key areas, based on
lessons learnt. The proposed transition towards economic infrastructure and productive activities was a
reasonable proposition given the fact that FONCODES had financed a large number of social
infrastructure (with prior IDB, World Bank and own financing). FONCODES did achieve or exceeded the
targeted number of projects (1,962 education projects, 4,905 water and sewerage systems and 1,076
electricity projects). Recent assessment of needs and the fact that FONCODES financed more than the
initial estimates show that the real needs were larger than projected.
Institutional development.  The focus of this component was to gradually decentralize FONCODES'
activities to the regional offices and increase the participation of communities, and local governments. This
component would finance further decentralization of FONCODES operations, including procurement of
some vehicles and equipment for the regional offices; development of the MIS; training of FONCODES
staff in the use of the MIS, the new Operations Manuals, participatory techniques designed to increase the
involvement of women and indigenous groups in FONCODES projects, simplified project preparation
methods, applications of the revised procurement and disbursement procedures, performance indicators,
and environmental guidelines; and training for local govermnents, NGOs and comrnmunity leaders in the
preparation and operations and maintenance of FONCODES projects, and the participation of women.
Consultant assistance would be used for the preparation, supervision, and ex-post evaluation of
subprojects, a series of special evaluations of innovative projects including productive projects, staff
training, beneficiary assessments, audits of subprojects and financial audits.
The component clearly identified specific activities necessary to decentralize FONCODES and to promote
sustainability of project investments. At the time of preparation, FONCODES was fully committed to
decentralize as much as possible the decision making processes and to promote community participation in
project implementation and sustainability. FONCODES was able to transfer the approval process to all
but one regional office. Also, as part of the Project, FONCODES implemented a new project cycle which
significantly reduced the preparation process of the sub-projects by requiring communities only to submit a
"Project Profile" (i.e. a very simple description of the desired project) as opposed to the former requirement
of the Project Technical File. Community participation was a key process inserted within the project cycle
at two critical points: the community assembly which brought together the whole community to determine
the priority project, and the "nucleo ejecutor", a group of four community representatives in charge of
managing the project, which was required to include at least one woman as a member. However experience
with local governments was less successful, largely due to the fact that local governments in Peru have no
legal role in the social and productive sectors and only a limited one in the infrastructure sector. They are
only legally responsible for water and sanitation infrastructure, though the specific responsibilities are not
clear. FONCODES staff were, in general, professionals with a strong commitment to the institution and
capable of implementing this component.
3.4 Revised Components:
Components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry of this project is considered satisfactory. The objectives were consistent with CAS and
government priorities of poverty alleviation. Project design was based on the lessons learned through the
implementation of the previous loan, the Social Development and Compensation Fund Project
(FONCODES I). Three beneficiary assessments and a mid-term review were carried out during
- 3 -



implementation, all of which resulted in the demonstration of successful components of the FONCODES I
as well as recommendations for improvement which were included in the new Project design.
Among the positive results of the above assessments were the adequacy of the geographical targeting
mechanism (although it could still be improved as discussed below), the degree of commnunity participation
in the selection and management of the project, and the management capacity of FONCODES as reflected
in the mobilization and use of resources for the financing of projects. The "Nucleo Ejecutor," as the
contracting agent, was found to achieve the desired objectives in terms of representing the community and
ensuring ownership of the project.
On the other hand, there were a number of areas that were shown to need improvement and were included
in the project design. These were mainly related to improving targeting toward the extremely poor
population, and increasing the involvement of women and indigenous groups. The project cycle was
reviewed and simplified in order to facilitate access of poorer populations, which had had difficulties
submitting projects. Thus, communities were no longer required to submit full technical files to initiate the
process with FONCODES. The new requirement was limited to the submission of a "project profile," a
simple description of the desired project, in order to initiate the approval and financing process. Also,
projects were to be financed in communities with 40-400 families, thus ensuring that rural populations were
targeted.
Under FONCODES II, provisions were also made to ensure better targeting of indigenous peoples through
the institutional poverty map. Involvement of women was clearly set out as one of the key overarching
strategies and provisions were made for its implementation (for example, the requirement that at least one
woman should participate in the "Nucleo Ejecutor" and that women participate in the communal assembly,
which decided on the project and elected the "Nucleo Ejecutor"). Environmental protection provisions were
also taken in project design: FONCODES was to develop environmental guidelines, keep an environmental
specialist as part of the institution's staff and train staff on environmental protection and mitigation
measures.
Another area that needed improvement was the relatively long time lag between project submission and
financing found during the previous loan. This was found to be due to a highly centralized project approval
mechanism. Thus, regional directors were given authorization to approve projects valued at less than
US$60,000 or US$20,000 depending on the size and capacity of the office. Larger projects were to be
approved at the central level by the institution's Board.
As a demand driven project, there were no fixed implementation targets, but indicative monitoring
indicators were agreed to.
FONCODES was interested in moving towards productive projects as a long term poverty alleviation
strategy. Since the institution had little experience in this area, it was agreed that they would be considered
pilots under the project and that disbursements were not to exceed US$4.3 million equivalent under the
loan.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Otttcome/achieve,nent of objective.
The Project substantially achieved its objective and is deemed satisfactory. To help assess the achievement
of the development objective, the GOP, IDB and the World Bank organized a stakeholder workshop to
- 4 -



listen to the views of representatives from civil society, local governments, beneficiary groups, government
institutions and from other social investment funds in the region (see Annex 9). An external impact
evaluation was also hired (see Annex 8 and Reference 2 in Annex 7). The results of both of these efforts
are reflected below.
On balance, FONCODES II investments were shown to have been relatively well targeted and to have had
a significant impact on education, health and household welfare. Specifically:
a) The education projects had significant impacts on enrollment rates (on average 34 new children per
school, net), on the number of grades offered per school (1.6 new grades per school), number of
teachers per school (1.22 new teachers), number of classrooms per school (I new classroom) and
total number of school years achieved per child (0.2 years). Paxson and Schady (4) confirmed the
enrollment rates outcome, and show that the "incidence of investments in educational infrastructure
is more pro-poor when these are made by FONCODES than when they are made by the Parents'
Committees or INFES.
b) The potable water projects showed small, but significant impact on the reduction of incidence of
diarrhea (3%) and mortality rates in children younger than 5 years old (2.4%), after controlling for
other variables related to the household, conumunity and presence of health facility. In addition, the
water projects had a significant impact on the time spent fetching water (66% reduction for
households with internal connections and 59% reduction for households using public connections,
that is 33.6 and 29.8 minutes, respectively).  Note that even though the health indicator results
appear to be small, they may be significant, given the difficulties in measuring impact of water
projects on health indicators.
c) Basic sanitation projects had little impact on health indicators. Latrine projects did not have an
impact on diarrhea incidence and only a small impact on acute diarrhea (2.4% reduction). The
low impact is attributed to the low level of use of the latrines, particularly by the jungle population.
Sewerage projects did not appear to have an impact. This is attributed to the fact that, as is typical
for this type of projects, households take long periods of time to connect to the system. For
example, the 1999 projects had 33% of beneficiary household connected to the system, while 79%
of households were connected for the 1997 projects. In terms of sustainability, more than 90% of
projects were reported to be operating well or with few problems.
d). Electrification projects appear to have had an impact at the household level in the medium term as
households take some time to have their connections installed. Still, impacts appear to be
significant in the self -valuing of dwellings (net increase of US$570) and in the number of electric
appliances in the house (0.4).
e) Results from the assessment of irrigation and rural road project were qualitative as they were
evaluated using case study methodologies. Still, irrigation projects were valued by beneficiaries
and appear to have raised significantly the irrigated areas as well as productivity (usually from one
harvest to two harvests per year). Rural road projects were highly valued by beneficiaries in terms
of product transportation to the markets, access to markets and to new products, arrival of public
transportation and greater security during travel (particularly for women and children).
The targeting of investments to poor populations was further improved by the combined use of the
geographical targeting methodology, focusing investments on communities with 40 to 400 families, and the
simplification of the project cycle. The impact assessment results showed that 17.5% of community
- 5 -



projects were financed in extremely poor districts (as classified in FONCODES' poverty map, based on the
1993 census), 50.2% in very poor districts and 29.2% in poor districts. While in the case of FONCODES
1, 20% of projects were financed in non-poor districts, in the case of FONCODES II, only 3.2% were
financed in non-poor districts. Schady (3) also found that FONCODES had been efficient in its targeting
process for the period 1992-1995 as compared to other agencies in Peru.
The relative success of the FONCODES model can be attributed mainly to the organizational set-up of the
institution, both within the government and in its relationship with the community, as well as its efforts to
promote project sustainability. FONCODES is an institution that is independent of sectoral ministries and
that has flexibility in the flow of funds. The use of the "Nucleo Ejecutor" (based on a traditional model of
community organization in Peru) for the planning and execution of the project allowed FONCODES to
transfer funds and ownership of the projects to the community itself. In some cases, the Nucleo Ejecutor
built a relationship with local governments which provided support through cofinancing of projects. An
added benefit of this contracting mechanism was that communities, including women, gained experience in
some first time management activities such as using bank accounts and managing relatively large sums of
money. Women participated as members in 43% of the "Nucleo Ejecutores".
However, FONCODES could have been more successful if it would have strengthened its capacity to
monitor its investments and developed a strong promotional component to ensure that previously unserved
poor and extremely poor communities were benefited. As Schady (3) points out based on his analysis for
the period 1992-1995, while FONCODES funding decisions had a technical component related to the
poverty alleviation strategy, they also responded to political imperatives. This risk was considered during
project design so that provisions were made to ensure that FONCODES kept qualified technical staff
during implementation, keeping the Bank informed of any changes. This requirement was complied with,
but it may have not been sufficient to keep FONCODES apart from political influence.
FONCODES II financed productive projects as pilots to assess the best means for stimulating economic
activity in poor communities. The results of these pilots showed that FONCODES does not appear to
contribute any value added in the productive sector. A mid-term assessment of the productive project
showed a number of deficiencies in the current design and recommended significant changes for future
expansion. Overall, it was found that the projects were not economically viable, very dependent on
technical assistance, too focused on traditional agricultural products (namely potatoes and maize), and did
not take into consideration the potential markets during project evaluation.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Community based subprojects. Achievement of this component was highly satisfactory. The project was
expected to finance about 9,000 community-based subprojects over three years at an approximate average
cost of US$46,700. FONCODES financed between 1997 and June 2000 a total of 14,398 projects. Of
this total, FONCODES financed 1,960 schools, 360 health facilities, and 7,686 water and sanitation
projects, 1,247 irrigation systems, and 1,369 rural roads and bridges and 322 productive projects. The
total number of projects is much larger than the 9,000 projects projected in the SAR, especially considering
that the project closed with approximately US$26 million undisbursed.  This significant increase in
projects is attributed to the delegation of approval to regional Offices allowing for faster processing. They
approved 7,511 projects while the Central office approved 11,920. Also, community sub-projects tended to
be smaller since FONCODES improved its targeting to rural areas (i.e. smaller communities), so that
project average costs went down from US$46,700 to US$27,000.
- 6-



FONCODES' portfolio did shift somewhat to economic infrastructure. Thus, while in the first project
schools represented 30% of the portfolio, in the second phase these projects were only 13% of the portfolio.
Economic infrastructure grew from 23% to 27%. However, the greatest change was observed in the water
and sanitation area. While before, 25% of the projects were financed in this sector, they represented 53%
of the projects under this loan.
Overall, the quality of the infrastructure financed by FONCODES was satisfactory. For example in the
case of the water and sanitation projects, only about 14% were found to operate inadequately or were not
working (2). On the other hand, there is evidence (5), that there were some design errors (due to relatively
low investment in project evaluation) that tended to be resolved during construction by the resident
engineer.
Institutional development. Achievement of this component was, on average, satisfactory. There were
four areas where the project was to provide support: (a) decentralization of FONCODES activities to the
regional offices, (b) the implementation of an MIS, (c) training, and (d) environmental impact assessment
and mitigation.
The proposed decentralization of FONCODES progressed during project implementation so that most of
the goals in terms of approval threshold were attained. By the end of the project, 22 of the 23 regional
offices were approving projects. It is not possible to evaluate efficiency indicators such as reduction in
project processing and financing time as these were greatly influenced by the severe budget restrictions of
1999 and 2000. A key factor of success in the decentralization process was the new project cycle which
ensured a homogeneous reference framework for all the regional offices. Thus, despite the fact that there
were many changes in personnel in these offices, there were clear standardized procedures that ensured
continuous processing of projects.
The MIS was developed up to the point where there were well designed independent modules for the
vanous parts of the project cycle. However, FONCODES faced a number of technical difficulties in the
integration process, which resulted in the partial achievement of the stated goal of facilitating
decentralization by having an integrated system that was accessible to the regional offices. In addition, the
MIS was not used to provide the necessary information for the decisionmaking process, namely
performance indicators.
FONCODES carried out the training on operations and maintenance directly, first through project
supervisors, and later through a team consisting of the resident engineer and a "social agent". The impact
assessment study showed that training did have an impact on the operation of the water and sanitation
projects (these were the only ones where communities received training). There was a clear correlation
between deficiencies and age of the project, where the older projects received little or no training. On the
other hand, FONCODES missed the opportunity of relying on local NGOs for the training on operations
and maintenance, which might have rendered this process more effective.
A significant effort was made in the development of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
Guidelines and in training regional staff (including evaluators and supervisors) in the recognition of
envirornental risks and mitigation measures. During field supervision, it was observed that all projects
were subject to EIA, and that mitigation measures were recommended when necessary. However, these
measures were not always incorporated during project construction. FONCODES staff were aware of this
problem and hired an environmental specialist within the project supervision area whose responsibility was
to oversee implementation of recommendations.

Midway into project implementation (August 1998) the FONCODES Executive Director and all
managerial staff were changed. This change resulted in a slow down of this component, while ongoing
activities, such as training and MIS development, and proposed studies were evaluated by the new team.
The implementation of the first component was not significantly affected by these changes.
This component financed a number of studies (see Annex 7). These studies included beneficiary
assessments and an impact evaluation, in addition to a strategic plan evaluation. The latter provides some
guidelines in terms of what changes should FONCODES implement, should the GOP decide to continue
financing infrastructure projects in rural areas.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The project was not subjected to NPV/ERR analysis. Evidence points out that FONCODES'
cost-effectivenes was significantly better than comparators in Peru and other social investment funds. The
cost-effectiveness study carried out on FONCODES showed that the operational costs were 7% of the
budget (of which 4% were fixed costs and 3% were variable costs). These were lower than those found for
comparator government agencies such as INFES and PRONAMACHCS which have operating costs of
around 16%. Other social funds evaluated as part of the SIF 2000 study reported 10%-13% operational
costs.
Project costs were also lower than the comparator agencies and other SIFs. While a FONCODES
classroom cost US$198.9 per square meter, an INFES classroom cost US$352.97 per square meter. In
addition to the difference in operating costs, the community manpower contribution and the use of local
materials (namely adobe) for construction are other factors that lead to lower costs. With respect to
irrigation canal the unit costs per meter were US$18 and US$26 for FONCODES and PRONAMACHCS,
respectively. Here, the difference is due, in addition to the lower operational costs, to the additional
complementary works financed by PRONAMACHCS (see Annex 3).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial rate of return calculations were not undertaken for this project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
FONCODES showed significant improvement in its efficiency to target, process projects and ensure
community participation. While the percentage of projects financed between 91 and 95 in extremely and
very poor districts were 31%, under the current project 67.7% of community based projects were financed
in these districts. Also, while previously 20% of projects were financed in non-poor areas, only 3.2% were
financed in these same areas under this project. FONCODES stopped using the poverty map for resource
allocation because it was based on 1993 census data and it became outdated. Instead, they focused on
ensuring that communities with 40-400 families in rural areas were targeted. In addition, at the beginning
of the project a system for prioritizing among projects submitted to a regional office was installed. This
system was to ensure that as many communities were served as possible in very and extremely poor areas.
This system continued to operate during project implementation.
The FONCODES model clearly emphasized community participation. Beneficiary participation in project
selection was much larger than the minimum required by the guidelines (78.7% vs 30%). Also, 88.7% of
the beneficiaries participated in the execution of the projects, contributing approximately US$27.7 million,
that is 6.9% of the total cost of the Project.

Although FONCODES worked well with the communities, they lost the opportunity to work with NGOs
and local governments. This was a reflection of the political climate at the time which discouraged
government institutions to work with these sectors.  Thus, in 1997, 63 projects had NGO participation
while in 1999 the number of projects was reduced to I with NGO participation. The same pattern can be
observed on local government participation; in 1997, 890 projects involved local governments while in
1999, the number was only 75.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Two factors outside of the control of the government or the implementing agency affected project
implementation. The first one was the El Ninlo phenomenon which destroyed or damaged a significant
amount of infrastructure, particularly in the northern part of Peru. FONCODES committed investment
funds for the rehabilitation of these works, somewhat reducing the financing of new projects elsewhere
during a period of approximately six months.
The second factor was the international Asian crisis which significantly affected the macroeconomics
conditions in Peru. As a result, the Ministry of Finance significantly reduced the flow of funds to all
investment projects, including this one, during calendar years 1999 and 2000. As a result, the project was
extended twice, each time for six months, until June 2000. In addition, US$25.4 million ha(d to be canceled
from the loan. The IDB extended its loan until December 2000.
5.2 Factors generally subject to governmient control:
During the early period of execution of this project the GOP had a clear poverty alleviation strategy.
FONCODES was given the role of working in rural areas because of its comparative advantage in this
area. Other programs, such as the rural school breakfasts program (which was previously managed by the
Ministry of Education) was transferred to FONCODES.
However, two serious deficiencies in the poverty alleviation strategy arose. First, decentralization efforts to
local governments were stopped and even reverted. Public institutions were discouraged to work with local
governments or NGOs. As a result, a number of government efforts, most visibly PROFINES (a program
which intended to bring local organizations together in a participatory planning process), were closed.
Second, public institutions were given mandates to deliver beyond targets. Thus, they concentrated more
on the means than on the ends (for example on increasing the number of schools, but not of children served
them, or increasing the food assistance programs but not the nutrition level of the population).
Nonetheless, FONCODES overall had a positive impact on reaching populations which otherwise would
not have been reached by other govermment programs, especially in remote rural areas.
5.3 Factors generally subject to imnplenenting agency control:
Based on the lessons learnt during the previous loan, FONCODES II implemented the new project cycle
under this loan providing a homogeneous standard of operation, facilitating the decentralization of the
project approval process.  In addition, FONCODES enforced the requirement that, prior to project
approval, the Ministries of Education and Health had committed human resources to the facilities.
On the other hand, FONCODES lacked a medium tetm strategic plan, which would have allowed the
institution to assess its own achievements and improve its implementation policy. In addition, because of
-9-



the lack of an integrated MIS, the institution did not have at hand a valuable management instrument which
would have also contributed to the decision making process. This lack of timely information also resulted
in the institution measuring itself in terms of expenditure levels and number of projects as opposed to
medium term goals.
5.4 Costs and financing:
N/A
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The community based projects will likely be sustainable. FONCODES concentrated its sustainability
efforts in community-driven water and sanitation projects through a training program on operations and
maintenance. Ex-post evaluations showed that, as a result of this program, beneficiaries have become more
conscious about their responsibilities in terms of maintenance of all projects (2, 7 and 8). Approximately
46% of households currently pay maintenance fees. The impact assessment found that 86% of the systems
were working well or with a few problems. Older projects, which did not benefit from a training program
or only from an incipient one, have a higher incidence of malfunctions or total inoperability, indicating that
training may not have been sufficient and/or that it may have started too late.
In the case of schools, the impact assessment showed that the community projects led to a higher number of
teachers per school. In terms of maintenance, the impact evaluation showed that parents associations,
which are responsible for this activity, participate more intensively as projects require more repair. In the
case of electrification, there is evidence of a large lag of time between the conclusion of the works and
connection to the electric power system. However, once the systems are connected, more than 90% operate
well or with few problems. More than 58% of users are currently paying fees, and in the case of the older
projects evaluated (1996-97) more than 80% pay fees. Irrigation and rural road projects were found to be
in good condition. However, while the first ones do have sustainability mechanisms (communities are
organized to carry out maintenance of canals), there are no maintenance schemes for the latter. Productive
projects, as currently designed, were not found to be sustainable.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
FONCODES was designed as a temporary agency; therefore part of the process to ensure sustainability is
the formal transfer of projects to the responsible parties (for example, Ministry of Education, Health, local
governments, etc.). A law was passed in 1999 to authorize FONCODES to transfer the works financed by
the social fund and the respective by-laws were published in April 2000. FONCODES has initiated the
transfer process through (a) an umbrella agreement with the Ministry of Education, and (b) through a pilot
for water and sanitation projects. In the latter case, water management committees at the community level
have been created and the legal processes are being tested in 75 projects in order to standardize them before
extending them to the national level. In parallel, FONCODES has trained Headquarters and Regional staff
on legal, accounting and operational issues related to the transfer process.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Baik
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance is rated satisfactory for the following reasons:
a) The project was prepared within the framnework of the 1994 CAS whose central objective was
poverty reduction through investments in public goods and services which directly benefit the poor.
The CAS also stated that the portfolio in Peru would move from adjustment to investment
operations. The previous FONCODES loan had proved successful in terrns of cornplying with
CAS objectives and in reporting very fast disbursements.
b) FONCODES I was considered a successful project for its ability to provide basic infrastructure to
the poor and the Bank decided to accelerate the preparation of the second project to maintain
momentum of delivery of services.
c) The Bank had also developed experience in working with Social Investment Funds (SIFs)
world-wide and in Peru through the prior loan. Based on the results from three beneficiary
assessments and the mid-term review, the team carried out a clear analysis of strengths and
weaknesses of the institution and safeguards were provided to reduce risks as much as possible.
For example, the project cycle was simplified, targeting (especially to indigenous populations) was
emphasized, participation of women was included as a horizontal issue, and the menu of
sub-projects was revised.
d) The current project was prepared during supervision missions for the first FONCODES project
which led to economies of scale in preparation. Also, the Bank team generated significant synergies
with the IDB, further reducing preparation costs.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance is rated satisfactory for the followin reasons:
a) Annual reviews were carried out with the borrower, in addition to a second mission every year.
b) In response to the recommendation of a procurement audit pointing out the need for further field
supervision and to the potential for political use of project funds, the Bank hired a local consultant
engineer who visited 19 of the 23 regional offices and 166 community projects. Feedback from
field supervision was used during missions and other meetings with the borrower.
c) Financial assessments were carried out, showing an adequate financial management system. An
expost procurement review was carried out which rated the project as satisfactory.
d) There was complete continuity in the supervision of the project as the second team leader was a
member of the team throughout implementation.
e) The project was supervised by a combination of headquarters and local staff. Supervision missions
were carried out jointly with the IDB and, between missions, the Bank coordinated with the IDB
- 11 -



staff in the resident mission. This reduced costs and enabled significant supervision work with
reduced costs. Also, coordination with cofinanciers happened between missions.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
This project was a priority for the government. Commitment by the government was shown in its rapid
implementation of preparatory activities, responsiveness to Bank request, and its allocation of necessary
funds. Borrower performance was satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation perfbrmance:
This project was implemented during a difficult period, including municipal and presidential elections, a
serious El Nifno event and the Asian crisis. The Government made its best effort to support FONCODES
during this period but the shifts in priorities and fiscal restrictions resulted in lack of counterpart funds
which led to the cancellation of a portion of the loan. There were claims, and for an earlier period hard
evidence (3), that there was political use of FONCODES. Still, FONCODES was able to provide
continued services to very poor communities. Notwithstanding these constraints, GOP performance is
deemed satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
FONCODES has permanently shown a very large capacity to process available funds and finance a very
large number of community based projects, always using the project cycle as the reference framework.
Also, FONCODES, as many other social funds, has had a demonstrated capacity to learn and change
accordingly. Many of the lessons learnt during the first project were included into this follow-up loan.
Project fund management was found to be in accordance to the loan agreement and to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. Issues dealing with the accounting system for the institution's assets, raised in the
Management Letters, were diligently resolved by the institution (11).  On the other hand, there was
significant turnover of management staff at the central and regional level. Even though this turnover did
not have an effect on project execution, it did have an impact on the institutional strengthening component
where targeting, decentralization and efforts to render the projects sustainable were less effective than
expected. Overall, implementing agency perfornance was satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
This section is mainly based on the results of the Stakeholder Workshop held on February 20, 2001,
although it also contains lessons learnt from Project implementation. The final report for this Workshop
and the list of participants can be found in Annex 8.
- 12-



8.1 Infrastructure Projects
Sustainability
*   FONCODES included training in operations and maintenance towards the end of the project cycle as a
means to ensure sustainability. However, workshop participants indicated that this is not sufficient.
Sustainability must be assessed during project evaluation by including socio-economic and institutional
analysis of the beneficiary community. The capacity of the community to pay fees must be assessed,
when relevant. The results of the assessment must be translated into project design and implementation.
*   The "Nucleo Ejecutor" (NE) is an efficient community contracting agent for project implementation,
but, due to its short-term character, the NE cawnot contribute to the sustainability of the project.
Therefore, the role of the NE should be reviewed so that it can take on the responsibility to coordinate
with other community agents and local governments and to follow up on the transfer of the project to
the appropriate entity.
*   In the case of water and sanitation projects, training is important to ensure sustainability but it is not
the only factor of success. Other factors include commitment by the community to adequate operations
and maintenance (including the responsibility of payment of fees). Local governments also have an
important role in larger scale maintenance of the system.
Empowerment
* Although there is clear indication that the demand-driven scheme is an asset to FONCODES' projects,
this may not be the best instrument for the development of the poorest communities. Participation
depends on existing social capital, thus where communities are weak, it would be best to have a more
proactive strategy, including a promotional component.
*   FONCODES has helped build local capacities through the Nucleo Ejecutor, by frequently providing
first time opportunities to communities to manage funds, deal with banks and procure goods.
However, the NE may not have had sufficient training to feel comfortable managing funds and, in some
cases, may have relinquished the responsibility to the resident engineer (see also Ref. 12). Also, the
NE may be undermining social capital development when it competes against existing organizations
within the community.
* FONCODES has been successful in its temporary intervention for the financing of small infrastructure.
However, in the future, this intervention should also take into account the social dimensions of the
project. That is, the community driven projects must include the development of social capital as an
explicit objective. To do this, FONCODES must ensure that local organizations, are actively involved
to take on the responsibility of the project and that the involvement results in consensus building
processes ("concertaci6n").  Coordination is also necessary between FONCODES, other state
institutions (e.g. Ministries) local governments, community organizations and leaders, in order to avoid
internal conflicts, duplication of efforts and to achieve longer term impact of projects.
*   Decentralization and a good project cycle are key to institutional efficiency. Delegation of decision
making activities to regional offices is key in making the project processing more efficient.
Accountability is necessary and can be achieved through a well-designed integrated MIS and a simple
project cycle that involves key stakeholders. Note that this is a first step measure because of a lack of a
real decentralization strategy in the government overall.
- 13-



Targeting
*   At the macro-level geographic targeting is the best available method, given its ease of use. However,
poverty maps are limited by their static nature and the lack of data beyond the district level.
* Micro-level targeting is necessary and local governments have a key role in this process. Clearly the
micro-level targeting must be done at the community level, with clear technical criteria. Communities
should also be subject to promotion interventions, with priority to those poorer communities which
have not benefited with FONCODES financing.
*   Social funds need to be monitored in terms of the national poverty alleviation strategy. Risk of
political intervention of social funds can be reduced if there is a clear national poverty alleviation
strategy and the role of the fund is explicitly stated. The strategy needs to include an instrument for
monitoring performance, other than achievement of physical targets. Targeting and promotion should
be key activities as even within poor areas there may be those who do not benefit from the social funds
while those communities that have developed capacity may be receiving more than would be allocated
to them.
8.2 Productive Projects
*   The role of FONCODES, and, in general of the Government, in the promotion and financing of
productive projects, is not clear and should be subject of further discussion leading to a national policy
on the subject. There are two diverging positions, the first one stating that the role of government is
only to reduce barriers faced by the community in order to integrate itself to the market. On the other
hand, there is the position that poor communities need more support than just barrier reduction in order
to insert themselves actively into the economy.
*   Should FONCODES continue working in this area, the institution would have to undergo major
restructuring as the current set-up responds well to infrastructure but not to productive projects. A
number of risks need to be avoided, including, inefficiencies in the decision making process,
sustainability of the projects, and budget management. Also, the demand driven scheme will have to be
replaced with a new one, possibly one of micro-planning, using market assessment and productivity
potential as targeting mechanisms.
*   Also, should FONCODES continue working in this area, it would have to evaluate the feasibility of
investing in other sectors. The pilots on productive projects carried out by FONCODES showed that if
they are exclusively linked to traditional agricultural production, the social investment fund has little
value added. It remains to be seen whether the social funds have a role to play on other productive
projects more related to ecotourism, handicrafts, etc.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results
Resumen Ejecutivo
Evaluaci6n de Impacto y Sostenibilidad
de los Provectos de Foncodes
1. Aspectos generales y metodologicos
I.    El Instituto APOYO se encarg6 de realizar la evaluaci6n de impacto y sostenibilidad de los
proyectos de Foncodes dentro del marco de Sexta Evaluaci6n Ex Post de los proyectos financiados por
Foncodes. La consultoria se llev6 a cabo entre los meses de marzo y agosto del 2,000.
2.     Durante la investigaci6n, el Instituto APOYO cont6 con le aporte de ESA Consultores (Honduras)
en lo referente al diseiio metodol6gico, la colaboraci6n del Ingeniero Arturo Rubio, en la definici6n del
disefio muestral y del Ingeniero Tirso Causillas quien colabor6 en el estudio de casos de los proyectos de
riego financiados por Foncodes. Cabe sefialar, sin embargo, que el analisis y las opiniones vertidas a lo
largo del estudio son exclusiva responsabilidad del Instituto APOYO, instituci6n que fue responsable de la
investigaci6n integral y la elaboraci6n del presente informe.
3.     El objetivo de la evaluaci6n fue detenninar cuantitativamente los impactos que los proyectos han
venido generando en la poblaci6n beneficiaria asi como identificar fortalezas y debilidades en materia de
sostenibilidad de las obras.
4.     Para lograr el objetivo propuesto, el Instituto APOYO realiz6 un disefno metodol6gico con dos
componentes: (i) un disefio probabilistico para la evaluaci6n de cinco lineas (educaci6n, agua, desagiue,
letrinas y electrificaci6n) basado en la definici6n de un grupo de comparaci6n ad hoc y en el uso de
instrumentos de cuantificaci6n de respuestas por parte de beneficiarios, operadores y responsables de las
obras; y (ii) un disefio no probabilistico (estudio de caso) para dos lineas de inversi6n en el area de
infraestructura econ6mica (riego y obras viales) con visitas de campo a proyectos preseleccionados.
5.     El grupo de comparaci6n para el estudio fue tomado del conjunto de proyectos en lista de espera y
emparejandolos con los proyectos muestreados por linea, estrato y ubicaci6n geografica.
6.     Se le dio enfasis al analisis de los proyectos de infraestructura social para la evaluaci6n
(saneamiento y educaci6n) y en funci6n de su peso en la inversi6n total del fondo. Asimismo, se incorpor6
la evaluaci6n de los proyectos de electrificaci6n dentro del area de proyectos de infraestructura econ6mica.
7:     Los proyectos de riego y viales fueron analizados mediante estudios de caso dada su naturaleza
particular que los hace cualitativamente distintos a los proyectos ligados a beneficios de las viviendas y
escuelas. Para estos estudios de caso se usaron tecnicas de recordaci6n sobre los impactos observados, asi
como observaci6n directa y apreciaci6n de los beneficiarios sobre el estado actual y la utilidad de las obras.
8.     Las variables de impacto y sostenibilidad para el estudio cuantitativo provinieron de las encuestas
de hogares y a encargados/operadores y estan orientadas a medir los impactos y niveles de sostenibilidad de
las obras, considerando los cambios en los atributos de las obras originados por la intervenci6n.

9.     El disefio muestral para el componente cuantitativo defini6 un marco muestral sobre la base de
cuatro lineas de corte del universo de proyectos financiados y terminados por Foncodes hasta 1999: (a) s6lo
el periodo 1996-1999; (b) s6lo en areas rurales; (c) s6lo las lineas de inversi6n en aulas, agua potable,
desagiue, letrinas y electrificaci6n; (d) s6lo aquellos departamentos con mas de 200 proyectos.
10.    Se estratific6 el universo en 9 estratos, usando como criterio de estratificacion una division en
proyectos grandes y pequefios con corte en la mediana del monto invertido en los proyectos. Esta divisi6n
se aplic6 a los proyectos de aulas, agua potable, desague y electrificaci6n. Para proyectos de letrinas no se
dividi6 el universo en dos grupos.
11.    Se escogieron 470 proyectos sobre la base de una selecci6n sistematica con arranque aleatorio para
conformar el grupo de intervenci6n. Este procedimiento se aplico para cada estrato y el nurmero de
proyectos total seleccionado en cada estrato se fij6 en forma proporcional a la participaci6n del estrato en
el monto global invertido.
12.    Se seleccionaron otros 470 proyectos de la lista de espera de proyectos de Foncodes para
conformar el grupo de comparaci6n, emparejando los proyectos en cada estrato a nivel de distritos o
provincias
13.    Se definieron un conjunto de variables de impacto para cada linea de intervenci6n entre las que
destacan, ratio y anios de escolaridad y tasa de asistencia escolar (educaci6n), incidencia de diarrea infantil,
mortalidad infantil, calidad del agua y ahorro de tiempo (saneamiento), valoraci6n de la vivienda, uso de
electrodomesticos y probabilidad de tener un negocio (electrificaci6n). El conjunto total de variables para
el estudio ha sido mas amplio pero el presente informe ha analizado en detalle los impactos condicionales
de la intervenci6n sobre este subconjunto de variables. El conjunto de estas variables se definieron tanto
para el grupo de intervenci6n como para el de comparaci6n.
14.    Se definieron variables de sostenibilidad de las obras basadas en las percepciones de los hogares y
en las declaraciones de los operadores/responsables de las obras. Estas variables estan orientadas a medir
la situaci6n actual y uso de las obras asi como los niveles de mantenimiento y pago de tarifas por parte de
los beneficiarios. Estas variables se definen solamente para el grupo de intervenci6n, con la excepci6n de
escuelas, en donde se cuenta con informaci6n para las escuelas no intervenidas.
15.    Para el analisis de impacto y sostenibilidad de los proyectos de Foncodes se gener6 un modelo de
flujos y activos en donde se ha establecido una tipologia que permite hacer un analisis integral del proceso
de intervenci6n en cuanto a impacto y la sostenibilidad.
16.    La tipologia de flujos propuesta es la siguiente: (i) los flujos de Tipo I establecen interacciones
entre Foncodes y los beneficiarios antes de la puesta en operaci6n de la obra; (ii) los del Tipo II son los
flujos desde las obras a los beneficiarios, (iii) los de Tipo III son flujos de operacion y mantenimiento desde
beneficiarios hacia la obra; y (iv) los del Tipo IV son flujos desde el entomo inmediato hacia la obra y
hacia los beneficiarios.
17.    La tipologia de activos es la siguiente: (i) los activos Tipo I son atributos de la obra en el momento
de prestar servicios; (ii) los activos del Tipo II son las capacidades de la poblaci6n beneficiaria para usar y
mantener las obras, (iii) los activos de Tipo III son los activos del entomo que afectan los flujos de las
obras de Foncodes.
- 25 -



18.    El impacto de las obras de Foncodes en el bienestar de los beneficiarios se estimara a partir de la
medici6n de cambios en el flujo de usos de servicios luego de un aumento en el conjunto de oportunidades,
controlando por atributos y capacidades de las familias y otros atributos del entomo.
19.    La sostenibilidad de las obras sera estimada a partir de la medici6n de los flujos de mantenimiento,
su financiaci6n y el estado observado en la operaci6n de la capacidad instalada generada por la
intervenci6n.
2. Resultados de la evaluacin de impacto y sostenibilidad
20.    La muestra obtenida luego de haber realizado la encuesta de campo a nivel nacional fue la
siguiente: 141 proyectos de educaci6n, 546 proyectos de saneamiento (agua, desagiie y letrinas) y 75 de
electrificaci6n. El total de proyectos en los que se realiz6 encuesta y se tiene informaci6n en una base de
datos integral es de 762 proyectos, es decir el 95% de la meta de 800 proyectos. El nmmero total de hogares
rurales para los que se cuenta con informaci6n es de aproximadamente 5,000, con un promedio de 6.5
hogares por Centro poblado visitado.
21.    Para las cinco lineas del componente cuantitativo se analiz6 la focalizaci6n de los proyectos por
estrato de pobreza asi como la comparabilidad de los grupos de intervenci6n y comparaci6n. El calculo de
los estratos de pobreza se realiz6 utilizando informaci6n sobre gasto alimentario de las familias, y
proyectando el gasto total en base a estimaciones tomadas de la ENNIV para las zonas rurales de Sierra y
Selva.
22.    En general, se encontr6 que las cinco lineas del estudio cuantitativo tienen muy buena focalizaci6n,
con una muy baja proporci6n de hogares no pobres beneficiados (entre 1 y 6%, dependiendo de la linea).
Los proyectos grandes de agua y desagiie mostraron las mayores proporciones de filtraci6n (hogares no
pobres beneficiados), mientras que los proyectos de letrinas aparecen como los que menos filtraci6n han
tenido.
23.    Respecto a la comparabilidad, se encontr6 que no existen diferencias estadisticamente
significativas en los promedios estimados de las variables de control observables para los proyectos
(tamanlo del Centro poblado, gasto promedio de los hogares, presencia de instituciones, rol de la comunidad
campesina o nativa, entre otros) para todas las lineas de inversi6n analizadas. Esto sugiere que ambos
grupos han sido bastante similares en variables observables. No obstante, en el analisis comparativo
usando regresiones se introdujeron variables de control por atributos de los hogares y del Centro poblado
que pudieran afectar la comparabilidad de los grupos.
24.    En el caso de los proyectos de saneamiento, se observ6 que un subconjunto de hogares dentro del
grupo de comparaci6n tenia acceso a agua y letrinas. Este grupo no estaria reflejando apropiadamente la
situaci6n "sin proyecto" que se busca generar para el grupo de comparaci6n por lo cual fueron excluidos
del grupo de comparaci6n. Asimismo, se excluyo del grupo intervenido a aquellos hogares que actualmente
no se estan beneficiando de las obras. Estos ajustes han permitido hacer las mediciones de impacto mas
robustas en cuanto a reflejar la situaci6n "con" y "sin" proyecto.

2.1. Resultados para proyectos de Educacion
Situacion actualy sostenibilidad
25.    Con respecto al estado de las aulas y su evoluci6n por afio y distribuci6n por area geografica, se
observa que las escuelas intervenidas en 1999 tienen una mejor situaci6n que las de afios anteriores,
indicando un cierto deterioro de la infraestructura a medida que pasa el tiempo, especialmente en los
proyectos grandes. Por area geografica, la regi6n Sierra Sur muestra los mejores niveles de niantenimiento,
mientras que la de la Selva los peores.
26.    Con respecto a la participaci6n de los padres de familia (APAFA) en las actividades ligadas a la
infraestructura de las escuelas, se observa que el nivel de participaci6n ha sido mayor en las escuelas
atendidas en 1996 y 1997, con una menor participaci6n en 1998 y 1999. Quizas esto indica que los padres
de familia empiezan a participar mas a medida que las aulas se deterioran, con un enfoque mas reactivo que
preventivo. Por regiones, la Sierra Norte tiene la menor participacion de la APAFA en actividades de
infraestructura, mientras que la Sierra Sur tiene la mas alta participaci6n (con 41%).
Impactos en educaci6n
27. La intervenci6n de Foncodes en el area educativa gener6 las siguientes mejoras en infraestructura
educativa:
aument6 en un promedio de 34 alumnos matriculados en cada escuela intervenida;
permiti6 ampliar el numero de grados en 1.6 grados por escuela intervenida;
aument6 el niumero de profesores por escuela intervenida en 1.22;
aument6 en 15% la probabilidad de que la escuela intervenida tenga grados de secundaria;
aument6 el nutmero de aulas promedio por escuela en I aula;
mejor6 en 24% el porcentaje de aulas en buen estado por escuela;
aument6 en 35% la probabilidad de que la escuela intervenida tenga conexi6n al sistema de agua
potable.
28.    Para estimar si existe algan impacto estadisticamente significativo de la intervenci6n en el ratio de
escolaridad, se realiz6 una analisis de regresi6n en donde la variable dependiente es la probabilidad de que
cada nifno asista a la escuela, y las variables independientes se refieren a caracteristica del nifio (sexo, edad,
idioma), del hogar (educaci6n de los padres y gasto per capita) y dominios geograficos. La variable
Foncodes" distingue al grupo intervenido del grupo de comparaci6n.
29.    Los resultados de la regresi6n indican que el efecto de la intervenci6n tiene signo positivo (0.9%)
pero con un bajo nivel de precisi6n estadistica (significativo al 27%). Esto pennite afirmar que la
intervenci6n no ha tenido un efecto apreciable en el ratio de escolaridad de los ninos en zonas rurales.
30.    Se analiz6 el impacto de la intervenci6n en los afios de escolaridad acumulados por los ninos en su
ciclo de vida. Se encontr6 que el efecto agregado de la intervenci6n en el conjunto de ninlos entre 6 y 14
anios es positivo y significativo al 8%. El grupo intervenido ha podido acumular un promedio de 0.08 anios
de educaci6n mas que el grupo de comparaci6n.
31.    De otro lado, cuando se restringi6 el anAlisis s6lo a los ninos entre 10 y 14 afios se obtiene un
impacto aiun mas preciso de la intervenci6n, con un coeficiente positivo y significativo al 2%. Para los
- 27 -



ninios entre 10 y 14 anios, el grupo intervenido ha conseguido acumular 0.2 afios mas de afnos de educaci6n
que el grupo no intervenido.
32.    Las regresiones para la variable afios de educaci6n tambien muestran que las caracteristicas del
hogar del nino (educaci6n de los padres y gasto per capita) tienen una influencia muy importante en una
mayor capacidad de acumulaci6n de afios de educaci6n por parte de los nifios. Esto sugiere que existe un
espacio para politicas complementarias de incentivos a los padres de hogares mas pobres para que tengan
mayores incentivos en invertir en Ia educaci6n de sus hijos en zonas rurales. Esquemas de subsidios
focalizados para la asistencia de los ninios a la escuela han sido implementados en otros paises y podrian
mejorar notablemente el resultado positivo obtenido con la actual intervenci6n de Foncodes en el area
educativa.
33.    Se analiz6 el impacto de la intervenci6n en la tasa de asistencia escolar. Los coeficiente estimados
implican que la intervenci6n de Foncodes parece haber tenido un efecto positivo en reducir la inasistencia
escolar ligada a enfermedades s6lo para los ninos entre 10 y 14 afios, mas no para todo el conjunto de nifios
entre 6 y 14 afios. La intervenci6n reduce en 4.5% la probabilidad de que un niiio entre 10 y 14 afios falte
a la escuela por motivos de enfermedad. Este resultado puede estar asociado a un mejor ambiente
educativo en donde es menos probable que los nifios adquieran enfermedades, o puede estar asociado a
programas nutricionales correlacionados con la intervenci6n de Foncodes.
34.    Para el caso de las inasistencias por otros motivos (ligados a incentivos de los padres para enviar a
los ninos a la escuela), se observa un coeficiente negativo para la intervenci6n de Foncodes aunque muy
poco preciso. Esto sugiere que no se han encontrado diferencias significativas entre ambos grupos con
respecto a las inasistencias por motivos ligados a los incentivos de los padres.
2.2. Resultados de los proyectos de saneamiento
2.2.1. Proyectos de agua potable
Situaci6n actual y sostenibilidad de los proyectos
35.    Un 7%  de los encuestados declara que los proyectos de agua potable no se encuentran
funcionando, mientras que otro 7% declara que ellas estan funcionando con muchos problemas. El
porcentaje que declara que la obra no funciona es mayor en la Sierra Norte (11%) y el menor en Selva
(2%). La Sierra Sur tiene los mayores porcentajes de hogares que declaran que las obras funcionan con
muchos problemas (10%) seguido de la Sierra Norte (9%).
36.    Por afio, se observa que los proyectos de 1996 tienen los mayores problemas (17%) seguidos por
los de 1998 (16%). Los proyectos mas recientes (de 1999) tienen pocos problemas segun los beneficiarios.
Estos nuimeros sugieren que actualmente 1 de cada 7 proyectos de agua potable tiene problemas de
sostenibilidad, tendencia que se acentia para los proyectos mas antiguos (de 1996).
Impactos de los proyectos de agua potable
37.    Para el impacto en diarrea infantil, el coeficiente estimado para la intervenci6n de Foncodes es
positivo y genera una reducci6n de 3.3% en la diarrea infantil generica siempre que los hogares cuenten con
conexi6n domiciliaria.
- 28 -



38.    Para la incidencia de diarrea con sangre en los nifios se encontr6 que la intervenci6n de Foncodes
en proyectos de agua potable reduce la incidencia de diarrea con sangre en 2.7% en los ninios entre 0 y 10
anios (en promedio), nuevamente, s6lo si los hogares cuentan con conexi6n domiciliaria.
39.    Se analiz6 el impacto de la intervenci6n de Foncodes con proyectos de agua potable en el ratio de
mortalidad infantil en ninios menores de cinco anios. Nuevamente se observ6 un efecto estadisticamente
significativo sobre los hogares que acceden al servicio de agua potable a traves de conexi6n domiciliarias,
luego de controlar por atributos del hogar, presencia de posta medica y otros atributos del Centro poblado.
El efecto estimado es de reducir la probabilidad de que el hogar pierda un niiio menor a cinco anios en
2.9%.
40.    Para el analisis del impacto en la calidad del agua se estim6 una regresi6n del tipo probit ordenado
en donde cada hogar ocupa algiun lugar entre los valores 0 (minima calidad) y 3 (maxima calidad). Los
resultados indican que la intervenci6n tiene un coeficiente positivo y estadisticamente significativo. Esto
indica que los hogares beneficiarios tienen una mejor percepci6n sobre la calidad del agua que los hogares
no beneficiarios.
41.    Finalmente, se encontr6 que los proyectos de Foncodes reducen el tiempo del hogar dedicado al
recojo de agua. Especificamente se tiene que, aislando el efecto del resto de variables de control, el ahorro
de tiempo para los hogares con conexi6n domiciliaria es de 96% y de 86% para los hogares sin conexi6n
(usan pileta). Dado que el promedio de tiempo que dedican los hogares a recoger agua en un dia tipico es de
55 minutos, el ahorro de tiempo producto de la intervenci6n de Foncodes para las dos fuentes de
abastecimiento es de 53 minutos y 47 minutos, respectivamente.
2.22. Letrinas
Situaci6n actual y sostenibilidad de los proyectos de letrinas
42.    A partir de los resultados obtenidos a traves de las encuestas a hogares se ha encontrado que la
Sierra Sur es el dominio geografico en el que una mayor proporci6n de hogares utiliza su letrina como
servicio higienico. Asimismo, se aprecia que mas de la quinta parte de los hogares beneficiarios que
cuentan con sus letrinas desde 1997 no las utilizan para los fines que fueron instaladas.
43.    Entre los hogares que cuentan con letrinas desde 1996, el 98% hace uso de las mismas como
servicio higienico; sin embargo, es importante sefialar que el porcentaje de hogares que cuentan con letrinas
desde dicho aiio (5% del total de hogares beneficiarios) es relativamente pequefio respecto al total de
hogares al que representa la muestra de proyectos de letrinas evaluados en el presente informe.
Impactos de los proyectos de letrinas
44.    Se observa que la intervenci6n en letrinas no ha tenido un impacto significativo en reducir la
diarrea generica de los nifios entre 0 y 10 afios pero si en reducir la diarrea con sangre. En este uiltimo
caso, la construcci6n de letrinas ha reducido la incidencia de diarrea con sangre en un promedio de 2.4%
para los nifios entre O y 10 afios.
- 29 -



2.2.3. Desague
Situaci6n actual y sostenibilidad de los proyectos de desague
45.    Se ha encontrado que el porcentaje de hogares que se ubican en zonas donde Foncodes ha
financiados proyectos de desagiue y que efectivamente se favorecen de ellos (es decir, cuentan con conexi6n
domiciliaria) es de 52%. Si se considera que en la muestra se tienen proyectos cuyos convenios datan de
1996, resulta preocupante el hecho de que un porcentaje significativo (casi la mitad) de la poblaci6n
beneficiaria aiu no se favorezca de los servicios. Ello seguramente guarda relaci6n con el alto costo que
tiene que incurrir un hogar para poder contar con conexi6n al servicio de desagiie (este se estima en
alrededor de S/.300, una carga alta para hogares que se encuentran en situacion de pobreza y pobreza
extrema).
46.    En lo que respecta al funcionamiento de los proyectos de desaguie segun el afio del convenio
(excluyendo a los hogares que no cuentan con conexion domiciliaria) se ha encontrado que los proyectos
cuyo convenio se firm6 en 1999 son los presentan un mejor indice de funcionamiento. Asimismo se aprecia
que cerca de un 6% de los beneficiarios de los proyectos de desague sefialan que las obras de desagiie no se
encuentran funcionando aim cuando estos hogares estan conectados al sistema.
Impacto de los proyectos de desague
47.    En un intento por estimar los impactos de las obras de desagiie financiadas por Foncodes en la
incidencia de diarrea infantil, se estimaron diversas regresiones para diarrea en general y diarrea con
sangre. En ninguno de los casos se obtuvieron coeficientes positivos y estadisticamente significativos para
las obras de desagiie financiadas por Foncodes. Esta baja influencia en el nivel de las diarreas de la
poblacion beneficiaria parece estar asociado al hecho de que pocos hogares del ambito de las obras estan
realmente utilizandolas (estan conectados). Esto puede deberse a diversos factores no necesariamente
excluyentes entre si como problemas de disefio, baja cobertura y/o a problemas de uso y sostenibilidad.
2.3. Resultados de los proyectos de infraestructura econ6mica
2.3.1. Electrificaci6n
Situaci6n actual y sostenibilidad
48.    Se encontr6 que los proyectos de electrificaci6n cuyo convenio se dio en 1999 son los que
reportaban menores indices de funcionamiento. Mas del 72% de los hogares con proyectos de ese afio
declaran que las obras de electrificaci6n financiadas por Foncodes no se encuentran funcionando
actualmente. Esto estaria reflejando el desfase entre el momento en que Foncodes termina la obra y el
momento en que el concesionario culmina las labores pertinentes (instalaci6n de medidores, pruebas, etc.)
antes de la puesta en operaci6n de la obra.
49.    En cuanto al pago de tarifas, se obtuvo que una mayor proporci6n de hogares beneficiarios de los
proyectos pequenos de electrificaci6n pagan por contar con el servicio, en comparaci6n a sus similares que
habitan poblados donde los montos invertidos en las obras han sido mayores. Ello podria estar explicando
porque los proyectos de electrificacion pequenos evidencian indices de funcionamiento mas favorables que
los proyectos grandes.
- 30 -



50.    Finalmente, se observ6 que en tanto el afio del convenio es mas reciente una menor proporci6n de
los hogares pagan una tarifa por contar con el servicio el&trico. Asimismo, destaca el hecho de que en el
caso de los proyectos de electrificaci6n cuyo anio de convenio es 1999 tan s6lo el 16% de los hogares pagan
una tarifa por contar con el servicio. Ello resulta natural dado que una alta proporci6n de estos hogares auin
no se conecta a la red electrica.
Impactos de los proyectos de electrificaci6n
51.    El analisis descriptivo indic6 que un niimero significativo de beneficiarios aun no se habia
conectado a la red electrica, pero no se observa una variaci6n sistematica respecto al nivel de gasto de los
hogares. Esto indicaria que la limitaci6n para la conexi6n de los hogares puede no estar influida tanto por
la capacidad econ6mica de los hogares como por aspectos tecnicos o por el hecho de que la obra es
reciente.
52.    La primera.variable que se analiz6 para establecer si existe algun impacto en los hogares fue la
autovaloraci6n de la vivienda. Los resultados indican que los proyectos de electrifica aumentan la
autovaloraci6n de las viviendas en casi 2,000 soles a precios del 2,000, un poco mas de US$570. Este
impacto es importante y podria indicar que los proyectos de electrificaci6n si estan teniendo realmente un
impacto muy importante en el bienestar econ6mico de los hogares al aumentar significativamente el valor
de uno de sus principales activos.
53.    Similar resultado se observa para el niumero de electrodomesticos, en donde el acceso a electricidad
aumenta la posesi6n de artefactos en 0.4 artefactos. Para el caso de la probabilidad de tener un negocio, la
intervenci6n no parece haber generado un impacto positivo despues de controlar por las otras variables (en
especial las dummies departamentales).
2.3.2 Proyectos de riego
54.    Los nueve proyectos de mejoramiento de pequefios sistemas de riego financiados por FONCODES,
estudiados en Ancash, Cusco y Piura, son exitosos en trmninos generales porque:
*      Han beneficiado a familias rurales en situaci6n de pobreza,
*      las obras de infraestructura de riego se encuentran generalmente en buen estado y funcionando
para los fines que fueron construidas y,
*      las obras han permitido incorporar 312 has de tierras eriazas al area bajo riego de seis de los
proyectos,
*      Se ha regularizado el riego, minimizando perdidas de agua e incrementando en forma inmediata y
en proporci6n aceptable los rendimientos de los principales cultivos,
*      Los proyectos de riego estudiados tienen algunas debilidades que pueden afectar su sostenibilidad,
*      Las limitaciones en tecnologia agricola que tienen los beneficiarios, le impiden enfrentar
adecuadamente procesos de empobrecimiento de los suelos, aumento de plagas, etc.
*      Los comites de regantes existentes en 8 de los 9 proyectos, con diferencias entre estos, tienen
fortalezas en lo que se refiere a coordinaci6n de la distribuci6n del agua de riego y el
- 31 -



mantenimiento de las obras en cuanto a limpiezas y reparaciones de las mismas, pero tienen
debilidades en la gesti6n de los propios comites, como falta de planes, cierta apatia para la
biisqueda de asistencia tecnica, no uso de registros de informaci6n sobre el sistema de riego y la
producci6n agricola de los usuarios.
55.    Los procesos de ejecuci6n de las obras se han desarrollado generalmente con normalidad, con
retrasos de hasta 33 % en el tiempo previsto, proporci6n comprensible en este tipo de obras. Algunas
limitaciones se presentaron en 2 de los proyectos, por demoras en los desembolsos por parte de
FONCODES, atrasos en entrega de materiales por los proveedores en un caso, incunplimiento parcial del
aporte comunal de mano de obra no calificada en otro caso y agotamiento de los fondos presupuestados que
obligaron a acortar la longitud de un canal, en otro caso.
56.   Las municipalidades distritales han colaborado en varios proyectos como promotoras y en el
funcionamiento posterior de la organizaci6n de regantes. Por su cercania a los beneficiarios de los
proyectos, pueden ser aliados importantes a tener en cuenta en otros proyectos de mejoramiento de
pequefios sistemas de riego.
2.3.3. Proyectos Viales
Situacion actual y sostenibilidad de las obras
57.    Las obras se encuentran actualmente funcionando bien. Sin embargo, nadie se encuentra a cargo
de ellas. Los pobladores manifiestan que no tienen ningun sistema de mantenimiento y que no saben quien
debe ser el responsable de esta tarea. Cuando se les pregunto que va pasar cuando se malogren, todos
manifestaron que la junta de campesinos tendra que hacerse cargo o Foncodes.
58.   No existe entre los pobladores con los que se convers6 una preocupaci6n por organizarse para
mantener las obras. Nos manifestaron que hay que esperar como pasan las obras la temporada de Iluvias.
En general se puede senialar que son comunidades muy pobres con muy pocos recursos para soportar el
costo de la reparaci6n de cualquiera de estas obras.
Impactos de las obras viales
59.   Las obras de infraestructura vial son de mucha importancia para las comunidades visitadas. A
pesar del debil flujo de trafico encontrado en estas vias, las obras traen consigo un conjunto de
oportunidades y beneficios para estas comunidades, que se describen a continuaci6n:
El transporte de los productos agricolas en temporada de cosecha. Segun declaraciones de los
comuneros, estas vias (puentes o trochas) ofrecen la oportunidad de traer vehiculos en epocas de
cosecha para poder trasladar de forma mas rapida y segura los productos de las familias de la
comunidad y lievarlos a los mercados mas cercanos. Antes de la existencia de estas vias, los
campesinos trasladaban sus productos en animales de carga de forma mas lenta y fatigante.
El acceso a mercados y nuevos productos de consumo. En las epocas de cosecha y fiestas, los
pobladores consiguen vehiculos para transportarse y tener acceso a los mercados mas concurridos
de la zona. En estos mercados se compran e intercambia productos como arroz, aceite, fideos,
harina, azucar, sal, alcohol; que ellos no producen. Antes de estas vias el acceso a estos productos
no era posible.

La llegada del transporte pAblico. En dos de las comunidades visitadas se registro que por lo menos
dos o tres veces a la semana liegaba transporte publico de salida por la mafiana y de Ilegada por la
tarde. Esto era muy apreciado por los pobladores porque era la primera vez que contaban con un
servicio de este tipo y segun sus propias declaraciones les permitia tener mas contacto con las
comunidades vecinas y con la capital de provincia. Manifestaron que usaban el transporte publico
para trasladar sus productos, hacer tramites, visitar familiares, etc.
El uso de bicicletas y caminos mas seguros. Estas zonas estan caracterizadas por encontrarse en
zonas muy altas y accidentadas con acantilados y precipicios profundos. Los caminos peatonales
que anteriormente existian eran generalmente muy estrechos. Esto hacia peligroso el uso de
bicicletas, que ahora es frecuente entre los carnpesinos varones. Con este tipo de transporte y a pie,
los pobladores se trasladan a las comunidades mas cercana donde generalmente se encuentran la
escuela, el Centro de salud, el municipio, la comisaria, la iglesia. Por otro lado, las mujeres
seiialaron que para ellas y los nifios los caminos eran mas seguros de transitar por las mismas
razones mencionadas.
La llegada de otros servicios.. En todas las comunidades visitadas esta es la primera obras que
tuvieron y por lo tanto es vista por la comunidad como la mas importante. Seguin sus propias
declaraciones de los pobladores de algunas de las comunidades, despues de esta obra lleg6 la
escuela y el maestro, la posta medica, y otros servicios. Indudablemente estas vias mejoran las
posibilidades de la comunidad de recibir otros servicios.
3. Resultados sobre las Comunidades Campesinas o Nativas atendidas por Foncodes
Proyectos de Saneamiento y Electrificaci6n
60.    Se registr6 que las familias que viven en Centros poblados que constituyen comunidades
campesinas o nativas presentan indicadores de niveles de vida relativamente inferiores a los que presentan
las familias del resto de Centros poblados. Los indicadores de acceso a servicios bAsicos como: agua,
desagiie, salud, educaci6n entre otros tienden a ser inferiores en el primer grupo quienes, ademas, presentan
una menor capacidad de gasto y un menor valor de sus activos.
61.    Esta menor capacidad de gasto que tienen las familias de las comunidades podria deterininar que la
proporci6n de familias que realizan aportes sea menor, lo que determina menores posibilidades de hacer
pagos a los encargados del mantenimiento de la obras por su trabajo o contar con los medios necesarios
para adquirir los repuestos. Esto tiene consecuencias negativas en el mantenimiento de las obras.
62.    En lo que respecta a los niveles de organizaci6n que existe al interior de los Centros poblados, se
muestra que los niveles de organizaci6n de las familias de las comunidades son significativamente
superiores a los que presentan las familias del resto de Centros poblados. Esto se evidencia al mostrar que
la existencia de las distintas organizaciones comunales es significativamente mas frecuente en las
comunidades.
63.    Este resultado estaria permitiendo que los indicadores de participaci6n de las familias en la
elaboraci6n, ejecuci6n y mantenimiento de la obras financiadas por Foncodes sean mayores en las
comunidades campesinas o nativas. Esto influiria positivamente para que este grupo de Centros poblados
presente mejores indicadores de funcionamiento, aunque las diferencias que se aprecian en estos
indicadores no son significativas.
- 33 -



En los proyectos de educacion
64.    En lo que respecta a los niveles de organizaci6n que presentan las familias de Centros poblados
visitados en los proyectos de Educaci6n se presenta la misma tendencia que se aprecia en los proyectos de
saneamiento y electrificaci6n, es decir, que la existencia de las distintas organizaciones comunales es mas
frecuente en las comunidades. Pero, a pesar de que las familias que viven en comunidades campesinas o
nativas tiendan a organizarse mejor, esto no ha contribuido a la mayor participaci6n de las familias en las
APAFAs en las escuelas, sobre todo en aspectos criticos como la mejora de la infraestructura educativa o
la mejora en el aprendizaje de los nifios.
65.    Respecto de los indicadores de infraestructura educativa, la intervenci6n de Foncodes en los
centros poblados que constituyen comunidades campesinas o nativas han permito un aumento del promedio
de alumnos matriculados en cada escuela intervenida; ampliar el nuimero de grados por escuela intervenida
y mejorar el porcentaje de aulas en buen estado por escuela. No se presenta impactos positivos de la
intervenci6n de Foncodes en el niumero de profesores por escuela, ni en la probabilidad de que la escuela
intervenida tenga grados de secundaria, ni en el nuimero de aulas promedio por escuela en I aula, ni en la
probabilidad de que la escuela tenga conexi6n al sistema de agua potable, cuyos impactos se apreciaba
cuando se trabaja con el conjunto de centros poblados y no s6lo con las comunidades.
66.    En lo referente a los indicadores de cobertura y desempefio educativo se muestran que no hay
impactos perceptibles en el ratio de escolaridad de la poblaci6n beneficiaria, ni en la acumulaci6n de afios
de estudios, ni en la probabilidad de inasistencia a la escuela por motivos de enfermedad o por incentivos
para los nifios entre 6 y 14 afios.
67.    En los proyectos de agua potable implementados por Foncodes en las comunidades campesinas o
nativas solo muestran un impacto positivo en los indicadores de calidad del agua y en el ahorro del tiempo
que las familias emplean en el recojo de agua, no importando para estos resultados si los hogares estan
conectados o no.
68.    De los tres indicadores de impacto analizados para los proyectos de electrificaci6n implementados
por Foncodes en las comunidades campesinas o nativas (el incremento en la valorizaci6n de la vivienda, el
aumento del numero de artefactos electricos y el incremento de la posibilidad de negocio en las familias),
los resultados muestran un impacto positivo s6lo en el niumero de electrodomesticos con los que la familia
cuenta.
69.    Al realizar un analisis comparativo de lo que ocurre con los indicadores de impacto, ya sea de
proyectos de educaci6n, agua potable, letrinas o electrificaci6n en los centros poblados que constituyen
comunidades nativas o campesinas y los resultados obtenidos para el total de centros poblados visitados, se
evidencia una tendencia a un menor impacto de los proyectos de Foncodes en el primer conjunto de centros
poblados.

Annex 9. Stakeholder Workshop Results
TALLER DE LECCIONES APRENDIDAS DE LA INTERVENCION DE FONCODES
1) OBJETIVOS Y METODOLOGIA
El taller busc6 identificar lecciones aprendidas -logros y retos pendientes- del accionar de FONCODES en
dos campos: la construcci6n de infraestructura basica en comunidades pobres y el desarrollo de proyectos
articulados de desarrollo, con enfasis en mejorar las capacidades de generar ingresos de la poblaci6n pobre.
La experiencia de FONCODES en lo primero es mucho mas amplia y estructurada, por lo desde un inicio
se entendi6 que las contribuciones en ambos casos serian de distinto nivel de precisi6n.
Cada uno de estos temas fue materia de una presentaci6n en la plenaria, que permiti6 centrar el debate, y
luego se dividi6 a los asistentes en tres talleres, para tocar los temas de focalizaci6n, empoderamiento y
sostenibilidad. Un moderador del Instituto APOYO estuvo a cargo de la conducci6n de cada taller,
mientras un relator tecnico extemo al Instituto APOYO, especialmente seleccionado por su familiaridad
con el tema, recogia los temas mas importantes planteados y ayudaba a plantear las preguntas
fandamentales al inicio del taller. El resultado de estos talleres fue luego sistematizado brevemente por los
relatores tecnicos y presentado a la plenaria.
El objetivo de estos talleres fue tener una sesi6n de lluvia de ideas informada que recogeria perspectivas de
diversos actores sobre el tema en cuesti6n. Las relatorias de los talleres, que se adjuntan como anexo, no
buscan Ilegar a una unica conclusi6n o recomendaci6n, sino reflejar las posiciones que fueron materia de
debate. El debate estuvo centrado en aprender de lo realizado por FONCODES en estos campos para
diseniar mejores acciones de politica piublica, independientemente de si estas son o no realizadas por
FONCODES. Las relatorias ex-post de los talleres reflejan una sintesis estructurada de las posiciones
vertidas en los talleres, con recomendaciones y diagn6sticos, en algunos casos identificando dos posiciones
contrarias.
Este resumen, por el contrario, no busca recoger todo lo que se senial6 en el taller, sino una apreciaci6n
personal y subjetiva respecto de c6mo optimizar toda la infonnacion proporcionada en los talleres para
identificar las lecciones mAs importantes que podria tomar FONCODES en relaci6n al futuro, sobre la base
de todo lo debatido. Este resumen ejecutivo debe ser complementado con la lectura de las relatorias tecnicas
de los talleres, que si han sido mucho mas objetivas y rigurosas, dentro de lo que cabe, para reflejar los
planteamientos vertidos por los participantes en cada taller. Las principales lecciones y recomendaciones
hacia futuro que se plantean son una interpretaci6n y una opci6n personal sobre los puntos y posiciones
debatidas bajo esta mecanica.
2) PRINCIPALES LECCIONES Y RECOMENDACIONES HACIA FUTURO
a) Infraestructura Basica
i) Supervisi6n de Sostenibilidad de Obras: Tanto el estudio de evaluaci6n como la participaci6n en los
talleres identifica a la sostenibilidad de los proyectos ya realizados como un tema de preocupacion. Si bien
existieron distintas posiciones reflejadas en el taller respecto de que instituci6n publica debia cuidar por la
sostenibilidad de las obras, como primera recomendaci6n se plantea disewar un provecto que permita
- 35 -



asegurar en el plazo de dos afios la sostenibilidad de las inversiones ya realizadas. Este proyecto, que
podria ser manejado directamente por FONCODES sin mayores cambios institucionales, deberia abocarse
a inventariar el estado de la sostenibilidad de las obras ya realizadas, diagnosticar los problemas de
sostenibilidad mas comunes y disefiar acciones de supervision y coordinaci6n con otras instituciones para
asegurar que el dinero ya invertido no se pierda por deterioro de las obras o falta de sostenibilidad
econ6mica.
ii) Fondo Municipal para Infraestructura Basica: Tambien en funci6n de las participaciones durante los
talleres se cons idera pertinente que se redisefie el ciclo del proyecto para que la presentaci6n de proyectos
por nuicleos ejecutores deba ser avalada, promovida o coordinada con el municipio distrital local. En este
nuevo tipo de intervenci6n, tambien compatible con la actual capacidad institucional de FONCODES,
podria tambien incorporar requisitos que los municipios deberian cumplir para poder acceder al
financiamiento del fondo. Ello se haria con el objeto de garantizar una mayor representatividad de los
gobiernos locales respecto de las comunidades mas alejadas de su distrito, asi como una mayor
transparencia y rendici6n de cuentas de la gesti6n municipal en general. El tipo de acciones que se podria
requerir incluye, por ejemplo:
- Realizaci6n de ejercicios de micro-planificaci6n de necesidades en los centros poblados de su localidad.
Realizaci6n de cabildos abiertos para la discusi6n de la asignacion presupuestal, tanto de recursos del
Fondo de Compensaci6n Municipal (FONCOMUN) como de los fondos aportados por FONCODES,
con representantes de los centros poblados (en similitud con la asamblea de beneficiarios del actual
ciclo de proyectos).
Compromiso a una contrapartida proveniente de recursos del FONCOMLUN. Para efectos de disefiar
esta acci6n, que seria compatible con la dinamnica de descentralizaci6n que posiblemente caracterizara
el gobiemo siguiente, deberian considerarse los siguientes puntos de referencia previos.
- Realizar un estudio sobre el uso que se ha venido dando a los recursos del FONCOMUN: un estudio
representativo permitiria un diagn6stico objetivo y realista de lo que implica un modelo de
descentralizaci6n que gire principalmente en tomo a la transferencia de fondos a gobiemos locales sin
mayor supervisi6n ni limites.
Analizar el programa de apoyo a gobiemos locales financiado por USAID en zonas cocaleras. Estudiar
sus logros y retos.
Estudiar las experiencias boliviana, colombiana y chilena de descentralizacion, especialmente la
primera.
* Estudiar las experiencias de otros fondos que trabajan con gobiemos locales, especialmente en
Centroamerica.
b) Proyectos Articulados de Desarrollo
Los participantes en el taller se dividieron en dos planteamientos muy diferenciados respecto de este tema.
De un lado, quienes tenian una posici6n en el sentido que el Estado debia entrar a promover el empleo para
poblaci6n pobre, a traves del desarrollo de infraestructura econ6mica y apoyo a la producci6n, sefialando
que FONCODES deberia pasar por un conjunto de cambios institucionales para adaptarse a ese nuevo tipo
de acci6n. Del otro lado, otro sector cuestionaba no solo que FONCODES debiese cumplir ese rol, sino el
hecho mismo que el Estado debiese o estuviese en capacidad de cumplir un papel de este tipo, pues la
visi6n empresarial es fundamental para la sostenibilidad de estos proyectos, y no es esperable que el Estado
tenga especial criterio para identificar las oportunidades de negocio que permitirian dar empleo a la
poblaci6n pobre. Estas dos posiciones contrarias podrian ser articuladas a la luz de lo planteado en el taller
sobre empoderamiento, donde se mencion6 que los conceptos de concertaci6n y participaci6n con otras
instituciones eran claves. Yendo mas alla de lo planteado en ese taller, pero recogiendo lo esencial de las
- - 36-



ideas que fueron alli expresadas, se puede decir que el rol del Estado es uno de facilitador y financiador
pero no ejecutor o promotor activo de este tipo de proyectos. Dentro de este marco, podria desarrollarse un
nuevo modo de intervenci6n para FONCODES en este campo.
Este nuevo modo de intervenci6n podria ser caracterizado por lo siguiente: FONCODES podria financiar,
de similar manera a los Fondos Contravalor, pero por montos de mayor envergadura, proyectos articulados
de desarrollo presentados conjuntamente por organizaciones de la sociedad civil -ONG, empresas,
gobiemos locales, etc.- en zonas del pais donde coincidan poblaciones pobres, potencialidades productivas
con mercados disponibles, y capacidades institucionales que pudieran permitir que estos proyectos sean
exitosos. A efectos de poder disenar este tipo de intervenci6n debiera revisarse las siguientes experiencias:
Proyecto PRA-CONFIEP, Proyecto ADEX-AID, FONDOEMPLEO, PROFINES, entre otros.
Un esquema como el propuesto permitiria que FONCODES mantenga un enfoque de demanda, que sea la
sociedad organizada la que presente proyectos a FONCODES para su financiamiento -en este caso,
proyectos articulados de desarrollo en zonas pobres, que incluyan obras de infraestructura economica y
otras actividades que promuevan la capacidad generadora de ingresos de dicha poblaci6n pobre-, que
FONCODES no intervenga directamente en un area mucho mas riesgosa para un organismo puiblico, que
se establezca como requisito el que los productos a ser desarrollados cuenten ya con mercados y opciones
de compra estudiados y, en cierta medida, comprometidos, etc. El sector privado, a traves de iniciativas de
responsabilidad social como las que vienen desarrollando empresas mineras, por ejemplo, en coordinaci6n
con ONG y gobiemos locales podrian asi presentar planes de desarrollo para comunidades pobres que
recibirian el apoyo financiero de FONCODES. Ello obligaria a una redefinici6n del ciclo de proyecto y otra
serie de procedimientos, pero mantendria algunos elementos de la actual estructura organizacional de
FONCODES.
3) PRINCIPALES LOGROS Y RETOS IDENTIFICADOS EN LA ACCION DE FONCODES
a) Una Buena Focalizacion
El estudio de impacto y sostenibilidad debi6 restringir la muestra por una serie de criterios para garantizar
distintos objetivos metodol6gicos deseables. En la muestra seleccionada (proyectos financiados entre
1996-99 en areas rurales de departamentos donde se hubiesen realizado mas de 200 proyectos, en las lineas
de aulas, agua potable, desagiie, letrinas y electrificaci6n), s6lo entre 1% y 6% de los proyectos
beneficiaron a poblaci6n no pobre. Los criterios de selecci6n de muestra sobrestiman la calidad de
focalizaci6n, por lo que los resultados generales no deben ser tan positivos, pero es seguro concluir que
FONCODES ha focalizado bien. Ello se corrobora con otros estudios del Banco Mundial, basados en las
encuestas de hogares, que identifican a FONCODES como uno de los programas puiblicos que mejor ha
focalizado.
Los talleres sobre focalizaci6n sugirieron complementar un enfoque de focalizaci6n geografica con
focalizaci6n individual, realizando esta ultima mediante mecanismos participativos con gobiemos locales y
otras organizaciones de la comunidad.
b) Evidencia de haber logrado impactos deseables en muchos de los programas financiados,
controlando por diversas variables.
Los principales impactos logrados y no logrados, por linea de inversi6n, son:
- 37 -



i)   Educacion (mas detalle en el anexo 4)
* 0.08 afios mas de afios de educaci6n en los alumnos de centros beneficiados
Reducci6n en 4.5% de la probabilidad de que un nifo entre 6 y 14 anios falte a la escuela por
motivos de enfermedad.
34 alumnos mas matriculados por escuela
*  1 aula, 1.6 grados y 1.22 profesores adicionales por escuela.
* 24% mas de aulas en buen estado.
No hay evidencia de un incremento en la tasa de escolaridad de los centros educativos.
ii)   Agua con conexion domiciliaria (idem)
* 3.3% menos de incidencia de diarrea infantil generica y 2.7% de diarrea infantil con sangre.
2.9% menos de mortalidad infantil de los ninios nacidos vivos durante los uiltimos cinco anos.
* Beneficiarios con mejor percepci6n de la calidad del agua
*  16 minutos diarios menos dedicados al recojo de agua respecto de quienes utilizan pileta puiblica
(19 versus 35)
* 79 minutos diarios menos dedicados al recojo de agua respecto de quienes no tienen acceso a
pileta puiblica (19 versus 98).
ii)  Agua sin conexion domiciliara (idem)
* Beneficiarios con mejor percepci6n de la calidad del agua.
No se aprecian efectos en los indicadores de salud.
iv)  Desague (idem, indicadores mds imprecisos, muestra mas pequenia)
* No existe evidencia de que este tipo de obras tenga efectos sobre su poblaci6n beneficiaria.
* No se aprecian efectos en los indicadores de salud.
v)   Letrinas
* 2.4% menos de incidencia de diarrea con sangre entre ninios de 0 a 10 anios. (Es debatible si este
es un efecto directo de la obra o son otros los factores que lo determinan, pues los ninios de este
grupo de edad podrian no estar utilizando las letrinas, que mas naturalmente son utilizadas por la
poblaci6n adulta).
* No hay evidencia de reducci6n de la diarrea generica de los ninos entre 0 y 10 anios.
vi)  Electriflcacion
*  US$570 mas de autovaloraci6n de las viviendas, a precios del afio 2000.
0.4 unidades mas de electrodomesticos
* No se registra efecto en la probabilidad de tener un negocio.
vii)  Proyectos de Riego (estudio de 9 casos)
* Beneficiarios rurales pobres
* Obras en buen estado y funcionando para los fines para los cuales fueron construidos.
312 Has. de tierras eriazas incorporadas al area bajo riego
Se ha regularizado el riego, minimizando las perdidas de agua e incrementando el rendimiento de
los principales productos.
Existen limitaciones en la tecnologia agricola de los beneficiarios que pueden afectar la
sostenibilidad de las obras financiadas.
viii) Proyectos Viales (estudio de 5 casos)
- Beneficiarios pobres
Obras en buen estado y funcionando adecuadamente.
* No existen responsables definidos para las tareas de mantenimiento de las vias. Los pobladores
no demuestran preocupaci6n para organizarse para tal fin.
* Pobreza de los beneficiarios puede impedir obras de mantenimiento o refacci6n.
- 38 -



c) Problemas de Sostenibilidad de las Obras
i)   Resultados del Estudio:
* Educaci6n: aunque las obras ejecutadas por FONCODES en los centros educativos han
permitido la mejora de su infraestructura, las obras mas recientes muestran el porcentaje mas
elevado de deterioro. Los padres de familia muestran un comportamiento reactivo ante el
deterioro en la infraestructura, mejorando los niveles de sostenibilidad.
Agua: uno de cada siete proyectos presenta problemas de funcionamiento, 46% de hogares pagan
por el servicio, y las obras presentaron, en promedio, 3.6 desperfectos en los ultimos doce meses.
* Desagiie: 52% de hogares con conexi6n, y 5.9% de hogares en los que no funciona.
* Letrinas: el 89% las utiliza.
* Electrificaci6n: de las obras cuyo convenio fue firmado en 1996, 100% de obras cuyo convenio
fue firmado en 1996 en funcionamiento y 93% pagan tarifas. Estos porcentajes varian
fuertemente segun el aiio, posiblemente debido a que el concesionario no ha concluido el
acondicionamiento.
ii)   Lecciones sobre como mejorar la sostenibilidadlempoderamiento:
Sostenibilidad Tecnica:
* Es necesario evaluar la sostenibilidad desde el inicio. Debe incluirse el plazo en el cual la obra
debe estar vigente/operativa.
*  Incorporar aspectos socio-econ6micos e institucionales en el analisis de la sostenibilidad del
proyecto.
* El enfoque de demanda no es suficiente garantia para la sostenibilidad.
- La sostenibilidad de las obras se incrementaria si se integra con politicas sectoriales y se
enmarcan en esquemas de gesti6n descentralizada.
Sostenibilidad Social:
*  Controversia sobre la legitimidad del niucleo ejecutor. Por un lado, hay quienes cuestionan los
beneficios de crear una nueva instancia de organizaci6n que compite con las organizaciones
existentes. Por otro lado, hay quienes la consideran como una instituci6n nueva y s6lida, capaz
de articularse mejor con otras instancias de la sociedad. Por ello, el esquema de modificar el
fondo para su gesti6n con participaci6n de los gobiemos locales y otras organizaciones, pero
exigiendo procedimientos y requisitos que aseguren el mejor funcionamiento de estas
organizaciones, y vinculandolas con la figura de los nucleos ejecutores podria dar respuesta a
esta contradicci6n entre dos visiones.
La mayor duda esta en c6mo el nucleo ejecutor puede evolucionar hacia ser una instituci6n de
mayor peso y duraci6n.
Revisi6n de los aspectos de la transferencia de las obras. Los aspectos legales y organizacionales
deben planearse desde un inicio.
La capacitaci6n, siendo ftindamental, no es condici6n suficiente, deben verse tambien los
criterios de participaci6n y empoderamiento de beneficiarios, transferencia legal y diseiio
organizacional de las organizaciones receptoras de las obras.
Sostenibilidad Economica:
* Se debe analizar la capacidad de pago de los beneficiarios desde un inicio.
* Hubo controversia respecto de que hacer en los casos en que los beneficiarios no tienen
capacidad de pago suficiente: subsidio o busqueda de alternativas de reducci6n del costo unitario
del proyecto.
Empoderamiento:
*  En el taller de empoderamiento se valor6 la experiencia del nucleo ejecutor, que permiti6
- 39 -



beneficiar a comunidades pobres y permitirles sin mayores interferencias realizar obras que
necesitaba su comunidad. Sin embargo, se cuestion6 que este modelo permnitiera en realidad un
fortalecimiento comunal sostenible, el cual pasa por vincular la experiencia de los nucleos
ejecutores con otras fuerzas de la comunidad, y hacer que estas obras respondan a un esfuierzo de
concertaci6n y micro-planificaci6n entre las distintas organizaciones de la comunidad.
La concertaci6n con otras entidades de la comunidad fue mencionada reiteradamente como el
concepto que debia primar hacia el futuro en terminos de la relaci6n del nJcleo ejecutor con otras
organizaciones de la comunidad, para mejorar el impacto y la sostenibilidad de las obras.
APENDICE I
TALLER: SOSTENIBILIDAD DE LOS PROYECTOS APOYADOS POR FONCODES
Relatoria
Para iniciar la discusi6n sobre las lecciones aprendidas respecto a la sostenibilidad de los proyectos
apoyados por FONCODES el grupo de trabajo de sostenibilidad decidi6 iniciar la sesi6n definiendo lo que
se entenderia por sostenibilidad durante la discusi6n. Asi, se considera que una obra es sostenible si esta
presta adecuadamente servicios durante el tiempo para el que ha sido diseniada. Esta definici6n limita la
discusi6n a la sostenibilidad de los resultados (obras) y deja de lado el tema de la sostenibilidad de la
instituci6n ejecutora.
El taller mostr6 la existencia de dos posiciones contrapuestas sobre la importancia de incorporar el tema de
sostenibilidad en la agenda de discusi6n sobre FONCODES; para un grupo el rol de FONCODES termina
cuando se entrega/transfiere la obra a los beneficiarios; mientras que para el otro grupo, FONCODES debe
incluir el tema de la sostenibilidad como parte de sus variables de decisi6n, pues FONCODES es un
inversionista y por ende debe preocuparse por los reditos de su inversi6n.
A pesar de la existencia de ambas posiciones en el grupo, existia consenso respecto a la necesidad de
discutir el tema de sostenibilidad, sea o no esta una responsabilidad de FONCODES, con miras a
incrementar el aprovechamiento e impacto de las obras de FONCODES.
Cabe recordar que el tema de sostenibilidad entra recien en el 96 a FONCODES.
Proyectos de Infraestructura
Sostenibilidad tienica:
Para que exista sostenibilidad tecnica debe incorporarse el criterio de sostenibilidad de la obra
desde la etapa de disefio.
Es necesario evaluar la sostenibilidad desde el inicio para maximizar el beneficio de la
intervenci6n.
Se debe adoptar un enfoque que evalie la obra en tanto parte de una intervencion y no s6lo como
proyecto/obra individual.
Se requiere de una evaluaci6n de los proyectos y obras, intervenciones en general, desde una
perspectiva mas amplia, no s6lo de ingenieria para producir la obra sino incorporando aspectos
socio-econ6micos e institucionales de los beneficiarios. Hacer una evaluaci6n mas integral de
cada proyecto.
Se requiere hacer una validaci6n de demanda como guia de la selecci6n de obras. Si la gente no
asume el compromiso de sostener/mantener la obra es necesario deslindar si es por falta de
recursos (econ6micos, humanos, de gesti6n, ausencia de responsables, etc.) o porque no hay
- 40 -



voluntad/interes de seguir con la obra por su falta de adecuaci6n a la demanda (si quieren
conexi6n domiciliaria y s6lo se proveen piletas, por ejemplo. Si Ia gente no hace suyo el
proyecto/obra quiza es porque el proyecto no era el adecuado para esos beneficiarios (por costos,
por capacidad, por deseo/expectativa de los beneficiarios.
La sostenibilidad de las obras se incrementaria si se integran con politicas sectoriales, y se
enmarcan en esquemas de gesti6n descentralizada.
Se mejoraria el nivel de sostenibilidad si se aprovecha la especializaci6n de otras entidades y
sectores, salud y educaci6n por ejemplo.
En el disefio debe incluirse el plazo en el cual la obra debe estar vigente/operativa. Este disenlo
debe incluir los compromisos de los beneficiarios en este sentido.
Sostenibilidad social:
Controversia en el grupo sobre la legitimidad del nucleo ejecutor. Por un lado, no existe consenso
sobre los beneficios de crear una nueva instancia de organizaci6n que podria competir con las
organizaciones existentes, mientras que por el otro lado, se considera una instituci6n nueva y
s6lida capaz de articularse mejor con otras instancias de la sociedad y del sector puiblica que las
organizaciones pre-existentes en las comunidades de beneficiarios.
*  No es claro como se da la evoluci6n del nucleo ejecutor hacia instituciones de sostenimiento.
- Existe consenso en la necesidad de involucrar a los municipios en las actividades de
FONCODES en general, pero en particular se debe trabajar con los municipios para asegurar
sostenibilidad de las obras. No hay consenso sobre c6mo se debe involucrar a este actor (es
decir, Zque transferirle: la obra, la responsabilidad, recursos, capacidad de decisi6n sobre la
obra?).
* Un tema fundamental para mejorar la sostenibilidad es el tipo de sistema/procedimiento por el
cual se transfieren las obras a los beneficiarios. Aspectos legales (titulos de propiedad) y de
arreglo institucional (tipo de organizaci6n que recibe la propiedad) deben detallarse y
planificarse desde el principio de la obra (inicio del ciclo de proyecto) para asegurar el
comprorniso de mantener la obra. j Quien es responsable legalmente por la obra entregada?
* La capacitaci6n es fundamental, pero resulta una condici6n necesaria pero no suficiente. Lo
mismo sucede con los programas de fortalecimiento institucional.
*  La sostenibilidad depende del tipo de empoderamiento que se logre y de la solidez, legitimidad y
fortaleza de )a organizaci6n de beneficiarios.
Sostenibilidad econ6mica:
No se evalua la capacidad de pago de la poblaci6n, luego se le exige que pague mas de lo que
puede para mantener la obra, este problema debe considerarse desde el disefno. Puede verse
como un problema de focalizacion.
Se requiere incorporar variables econ6micas en el analisis de la viabilidad de las obras no s6lo
aspectos tecnicos. Se presento controversia ante afinnaciones del tipo: Quiza es mejor hacer
obras mas lentamente o con costos unitarios no tan bajos pero mas sostenibles.
Entonces, el mejor escenario posible es: si todo se hace bien (focaliza, empodera, valida por
demanda, transfiere adecuadamente) y las acciones se eslabonan con estrategias de desarrollo
local (descentralizaci6n) y sectorial, y si el tema de la sostenibilidad se discute como objetivo
desde el disefio del proyecto (como parte de la evaluaci6n integral del proyecto), las posibilidades
de que la obra sea sostenible aumentan.
Proyectos Productivos
El taller sobre sostenibilidad de proyectos productivos promovidos por FONCODES se organiz6 sobre la
base de dos preguntas:
- 41 -



Debe el sector publico, y en especifico FONCODES, dedicarse a realizar proyectos productivos, y,
*  Si el sector publico, y en especifico FONCODES, deciden continuar con proyectos productivos,
,como se asegura la sostenibilidad de los mismos?
El taller se concentr6 en la discusi6n del primer punto, pues no se Iogr6 una posici6n de consenso sino mas
bien se gener6 una controversia respecto a la pertinencia de intervenir a traves de proyectos productivos.
Por un lado, se presentaron posiciones sefialando que el Estado no es un buen productor y que debe
limitarse a reducir las barreras que enfrentan los pobladores de menores recursos para integrarse con los
mercados. Es decir, debe privilegiarse la inversi6n en infraestructura social y econ6mica y dejar al sector
privado y a los propios beneficiarios las decisiones de aspectos productivos Por el otro lado, se manifest6
que existen comunidades en las que no basta con reducir barreras para iniciar actividades productivas
sostenidas y rentables y que debe definirse una intervenci6n orientada a promover el desarrollo de estas
comunidades hasta el punto en que puedan seguir solas sobre la base de la iniciativa privada.
En esta discusi6n se mencionaron los principales riesgos que se asocian a la participaci6n de FONCODES
en actividades productivas, estos serian:
* Ineficiencia en la toma de decisiones
* Insostenibilidad dado que dependerA de FONCODES
* Costoso
*  Se debera abandonar la estrategia de selecci6n sobre la base de demanda (demand-driven) para
pasar a una basada en una orientaci6n hacia el mercado que tendra que ser -impuesta- hacia los
beneficiarios (top-down)
Se puede caer en procesos de desarrollo ficticio que terminan con la descapitalizaci6n de los
programas
* Se suelen unir en un mismo programa asistencia tecnica y credito, dejando de reconocer sus
peculiaridades.
* No se logran suficientes eslabonamientos productivos
* No se genera/fortalece institucionalidad sino que se promueve una no necesariamente legitima,
luego cuando se retira el proyecto la institucionalidad no se sostiene ni logra sostener la
intervenci6n.
* Riesgo de intervenci6n politica y discrecionalidad en toma de decisiones.
Asimismo, se mencion6 que existirian beneficios de intervenciones de FONCODES en proyectos
productivos:
* Adecuada presencia en zonas que requieren este tipo de intervenci6n
* Se puede pensar en un esquema que se encargue s6lo de dar un impulso inicial para promover
eslabonamientos con mercados y/o con otras instituciones sociales o del sector puiblico.
* La intervenci6n de FONCODES puede reducir los niveles de riesgo asociados a distintas zonas en
las que el sector privado no opera, luego de reducido este riesgo el sector privado podria entrar.
Se podria enmarcar en una estrategia mayor de desarrollo de mercados en coordinaci6n con otros
sectores/agencias del sector publico/instancias locales.
La interrogante que se desprendi6 luego es si FONCODES esta preparado para manejar estos riesgos y
capitalizar los beneficios de una intervenci6n en proyectos productivos. Para un grupo el tema no se puede
limitar a esa evaluaci6n sino que mAs bien debe verse desde una perspectiva mas macro, es decir, si
FONCODES no promueve proyectos productivos en estas zonas, nadie lo hara, por lo que se debe
- 42 -



promover la mejor intervenci6n posible de FONCODES como unico actor posible en determinadas zonas y
evaluarlo dentro de una propuesta integral de alivio a la pobreza del pais y no de una zona en particular.
Aqui surge una nueva controversia sobre el rol de FONCODES como programa de alivio de la pobreza
versus un programa de desarrollo.
Surgieron varios temas transversales que deben tomarse en cuenta para decidir si FONCODES debe o no
participar en proyectos productivos. Estos temas serian:
CuaI es la institucionalidad necesaria para que FONCODES pueda intervenir bajo esta modalidad
* CuaI es el rol de las ONG y del sector privado.
* C6mo se enfrenta el reto de la sostenibilidad?: Las condiciones minimas serian: institucionalidad
fuerte (no politica) transferible a la comunidad, interacci6n con otras intervenciones de
FONCODES y de otros sectores (coordinaci6n) y asegurar que los proyectos productivos no se
limitan a proyectos de producci6n agropecuaria.
Se sugiri6 que dado que existia un relativo acuerdo de que habia instituciones bien preparadas para
participar en determinadas etapas de los proyectos productivos se debia analizar la posibilidad de que el rol
de FONCODES, al menos en algunos aspectos/zonas, sea el de una instituci6n de segundo piso que opere
con ONGs, sector privado, municipios, organizaciones de la sociedad, etc.
Qued6, finalmente, la necesidad de hacer una reflexi6n de para que se entra a hacer proyectos productivos
en zonas donde el mercado no Ilega, y considerar la opci6n de utilizar los proyectos productivos como un
mecanismo de transferencia de capacidades. Sin embargo, no hubo consenso en este punto.
APENDICE II
TALLER: EMPODERAMIENTO, PARTICIPACION Y CAPITAL SOCIAL
Proyectos de Infraestructura
En el taller se reconocieron importantes meritos en la intervenci6n de FONCODES en los ultimos anios;
sobre todo, una buena ejecucion de los fondos disponibles, evitando una intermediaci6n que podria resultar
innecesaria y generar perdidas de eficiencia. Asi, la percepci6n fue que se logr6 una focalizaci6n adecuada,
llegando a los pobres y mas pobres, cubriendo todo el territorio del pais, en plazos bastante rapidos. De
otro lado, se reconoci6 como positivo el componente participativo del programa, que buscaba relacionar de
manera directa a la instituci6n con las comunidades de base, expresadas en los Niucleos Ejecutores (NE).
En el disefio, los NE resultaron una iniciativa interesante para hacer participar a las comunidades, de modo
de estimular el desarrollo de sus capacidades. De hecho, se han registrado muchas experiencias exitosas, en
las cuales la participaci6n permiti6 el ahorro de recursos, el cumplimiento de las metas previstas y la
sostenibilidad de los proyectos; una clave para esto parece residir en el establecimiento de relaciones
arm6nicas y de colaboraci6n entre FONCODES, los NE, los lideres y organizaciones existentes en las
comunidades, y la poblaci6n en general, dandose una dinamica de apoyo y fortalecimiento mutuo. A pesar
de esto, tambien se han registrado muchos problemas. Surge asi un primer desafio, el lograr que el disenlo
participativo se de efectivarnente en la ejecuci6n a nivel de base, c6mo implementar mecanismos
institucionales que eviten la desnaturalizaci6n de lo propuesto a nivel central.
Se dieron asi evaluaciones criticas. Podriamos decir que algunas apuntan a problemas menores, que aluden
bAsicamente a la necesidad de hacer mas flexibles los programas, de modo que sean capaces de ajustarse a
las particularidades locales, inevitables en un pais tan diverso como el nuestro. Esto seria una
- 43 -



manifestaci6n mas del centralismo que debemos combatir. Se mencion6 por ejemplo la necesidad de dar
mayor grado de autonomia, en cuanto a la toma de decisiones, a Jos organismos zonales de FONCODES;
tambien a los NE.
Pero la parte mayor y mas interesante de las criticas apunt6 a cuestiones sustantivas. Se dijo que en el
disefio participativo de los NE no se plante6 seriamente una estrategia de empoderamiento de las
comunidades, pese a algunos planteamientos que quedaron muchas veces en buenas intenciones. La
estrategia de hacer participar a la comunidad en los proyectos tuvo en la practica como objetivo casi
exclusivo el lograr un uso eficaz de los recursos, evitando la intermediaci6n de otras instancias, y no se
plante6 seriamente la dimensi6n social de los proyectos, el fortalecimiento de las capacidades de las
comunidades, de sus organizaciones y lideres, y por consiguiente, de sus posibilidades de acci6n colectiva.
Se reconoci6 que ciertamente es sencillo hacer este cuestionamiento y dificil convertirlo en un diseiio
institucional concreto que no genere perdidas de eficiencia, pero es claro que hacia delante estamos ante un
reto ineludible.
Entrando en detalle, se mencion6 que la 16gica de los NE no busc6 coordinar o relacionarse con las
organizaciones preexistentes en las comunidades o la poblaci6n en general, a lo largo de las diversas etapas
de los proyectos, quedando en muchas ocasiones el componente participativo como algo puramente formal.
En la practica, no se puede decir que hayan sido siempre las -comunidades- las que hayan tomado las
decisiones. Frecuentemente una serie de actores intervinieron de manera decisiva: alcaldes, lideres sociales,
funcionarios estatales, y los propios promotores o contratistas de FONCODES, que resultan tomando las
decisiones; todos ellos aparecen cumpliendo funciones de intermediaci6n entre comunidades desarticuladas
y FONCODES. Asi, se mencion6 que muchas veces las comunidades no se identifican ni comprometen
seriamente con los proyectos, aceptandolos pasivamente; no los -hacen suyos-, pese a que las asambleas
comunales y NE representativos de ella, en teoria, toman las decisiones.
El problema de la falta de una participaci6n efectiva tiene consecuencias serias sobre la eficiencia de las
obras y sobre su sostenibilidad. Se mencion6 que el no seguir una metodologia de diagn6stico participativo
de los problemas llev6 a que, por ejemplo, en algunos lugares se construyeran pozos y letrinas en lugares
inundables, cosa que podria haberse evitado facilmente de haber mediado una consulta con la poblaci6n.
Esto seria consecuencia de una suerte de enfoque "tecnocritico" de la intervenci6n de FONCODES, que
deja de lado aspectos sociales. AdemAs, la falta de participaci6n y fiscalizaci6n no permite una rendici6n de
cuentas efectiva, y puede tambien causando problemas de mal uso de recursos. El no tomar en cuenta la
relaci6n entre los NE y las comunidades y sus organizaciones "naturales" hace que en muchas ocasiones
los NE sean "capturados" por intereses particulares, se autonomicen de la poblaci6n en general,
generandose una suerte de paralelismo, competencia, respecto a otras organizaciones, que lleva a la
exacerbaci6n de conflictos, en vez de coordinaci6n y apoyo mutuo. Tambien se presentan problemas de
sostenibilidad, porque una vez hechas las obras los NE desaparecen, no quedando clara la responsabilidad
por el mantenimiento de las mismas. Para esto resulta crucial involucrar a las organizaciones e
instituciones que se mantienen mas alla de los NE.
Por esto, la palabra clave para enfrentar estas situaciones es concertaci6n, termino empleado
reiteradamnente en el taller. Concertaci6n entre FONCODES, otros organismos estatales, los NE, alcaldes,
presidentes de comunidades, lideres sociales, organizaciones, ONGs, en suma, el conjunto del tejido
politico y social de las zonas de intervenci6n. La ausencia de coordinaci6n lleva a una dinamica de
conflictos incluso entre distintas instituciones estatales, que duplican esfuerzos, y finalmente diluyen
responsabilidades. Se mencion6 por ejemplo la falta de coordinaci6n entre FONCODES y el Ministerio de
Salud en lo que atafie a obras de saneamiento, o con el Ministerio de Educaci6n a prop6sito de la
construcci6n de escuelas. Se perdi6 asi la posibilidad de una intervenci6n mas eficaz, basada en una mirada
- 44 -



mas amplia de la problematica del desarrollo, que viera mas alla de la mera ejecuci6n inmediatista de
obras.
Afortunadamente, existen algunas experiencias de concertaci6n interesantes de las cuales aprender. Se
habl6 de diversas "Mesas de concertaci6n", que ejecutaban ya diversos proyectos de desarrollo en varios
lugares del pais. Pese a ser experiencias algo aisladas, resultan un buen punto de partida. Se habl6 de la
importancia de incorporar a la poblaci6n organizada, tomando en cuenta que en algunos contextos la
participaci6n debe ser promovida, dado que tambien se ha producido un debilitamiento de las posibilidades
de acci6n colectiva de la poblaci6n. Esto implica trabajar en cuanto a la capacitaci6n de la poblaci6n en
general y fortalecer y democratizar las organizaciones existentes, para asegurar su representatividad y
legitimidad. Asi podria evitarse que la participaci6n no se limite a s6lo algunos segmentos de las
comunidades, dejando de lado a sectores mAs vulnerables como las mujeres o los j6venes.
Esto uiltimo nos lleva a otro desafio senialado en las discusiones. Dado que la pobreza se asocia tambien a
escasas capacidades de acci6n colectiva, de organizaci6n, de expresi6n de demandas, el enfasis en la
participaci6n de la poblaci6n podria generar un sesgo involuntario que excluya precisamente a los mas
pobres, marginales y necesitados. La estrategia de FONCODES, basada en la demanda de las comunidades
(demand-driven), debe mantenerse por su enfasis en la participaci6n, pero FONCODES debe tambien
hacer un esfuerzo por llegar alli donde la pobreza hace dificil la expresi6n de demandas.
Proyectos Productivos
En esta parte del taller se parti6 de la necesidad de no perder de vista la naturaleza de FONCODES: una
instituci6n que intervendria de manera temporal para compensar a los mas necesitados en una situaci6n de
emergencia. La problematica del desarrollo, de la producci6n, de la generaci6n de empleo e ingresos,
claramente la desbordan. FONCODES tiene un papel que desempefiar, pero formando parte de una
estrategia nacional e integral de combate a la pobreza, que vincule la politica econ6mica y la politica social,
que lamentablemente no ha existido.
Al igual que en la sesi6n en la que se discutieron los proyectos de infraestructura, las palabras
participaci6n y concertaci6n aparecieron como palabras clave para lograr empoderamiento de las
comunidades, y viabilidad y sostenibilidad de los proyectos. A diferencia de los proyectos analizados en la
primera sesi6n, aca es claro que tiene que incorporarse una l6gica econ6mica; los proyectos no s6lo deben
buscar Ilegar a los mAs pobres, sino que tienen que lograr ser competitivos en el mercado. Para esto resulta
necesario ir mAs alla de una focalizaci6n territorial que identifique las zonas mas pobres, y tratar de ubicar
en tomo a ellos circuitos econ6micos dinamicos con potencial de crecimiento, sin los cuales la intervenci6n
no tendria sentido. A pesar de que la inversi6n en infraestructura productiva (caminos, canales) tiene de por
si un valor intrinseco, es claro tambien que si no forman parte de una estrategia integral de desarrollo
serian escasos sus efectos.
Aqui la participaci6n implica permitir que los actores tomen las decisiones de mercado, pero contando con
el apoyo de organismos del Estado que permitan superar problemas de informaci6n, falta de capacitaci6n y
distorsiones de mercado. Nuevamente se presenta acA la necesidad de establecer vinculos entre aquellos
grupos sociales pobres, pero con algiun dinamismo social y potencial de crecimiento econ6mico, y los
pobres extremos, que lo son precisamente por carecer de estas caracteristicas. La estrategia de intervenci6n
debe combinar componentes sociales y econ6micos, de modo que se generen eslabonamientos y vinculos
entre los sectores dinamicos y los mas pobres.
- 45 -



En cuanto a la concertaci6n, se resalt6 la importancia de estimular espacios de coordinaci6n entre el
conjunto de actores involucrados en el desarrollo no s6lo de las comunidades, sino de espacios mas
amplios, expresivos de potencialidades de desarrollo regionales. Dentro de ellos, destaca la importancia de
los municipios, junto con organizaciones y lideres sociales, ONGs, y las diversas instituciones estatales. Lo
bueno es que existen experiencias de las cuales aprender, como las mesas de concertaci6n existentes en
varios lugares del pais, y algunas practicas tradicionales y solidarias presentes en casi todos nuestros
pueblos. Ciertamente es mucho mas facil hablar de la importancia de la concertaci6n que Ilevarla a la
realidad practica, pero con todo, hay ya cierta tradici6n que recoger y potenciar. Esto implicaria un cambio
en la concepci6n tradicional del Estado, asumiendo un papel mas activo y promotor, estimulando el
desarrollo de mecanismos de mercado. Felizmente, en la actualidad parece haber mayor permeabilidad a
este tipo de propuestas.
APENDICE III
TALLER DE FOCALIZACION DE INFRAESTRUCTURA BASICA:
La focalizaci6n para los esfuerzos de lucha contra la pobreza puede realizarse a traves de instrumentos de
focalizaci6n geografica, que identifican las areas geograficas en las que existen mayores niveles y
concentraci6n de pobreza, asi como a traves de instrumentos de focalizaci6n individual, que buscan
identificar al interior de una zona geografica los hogares mas pobres. Lo primero es mas facil de realizar,
lo segundo mAs costoso.
FONCODES ha focalizado sus recursos mediante instrumentos de focalizaci6n geografica (Mapa de la
Pobreza), teniendo en ese campo resultados muy positivos, en terminos generales. No ha utilizado
instrumentos de focalizaci6n individual. Ambos elementos fueron materia de debate y propuestas.
En el campo de la focalizaci6n geografica, se plante6 dudas respecto de que el estudio de impacto reflejara
adecuadamente los niveles de filtraci6n hacia sectores no pobres, pues los resultados (entre I y 6%)
resultaban sorprendentes. Los autores del estudio hicieron notar que la evaluaci6n no apuntaba a medir la
focalizaci6n, sino se concentraba en medir el impacto y la sostenibilidad para un conjunto muy
representativo de las obras de FONCODES, y que para poder construir una metodologia que midiera el
impacto y la sostenibilidad de las obras, habia sido necesario definir el marco muestral bajo ciertos criterios
que habian sido explicitados al inicio de la presentacion. Entre ellos, el haberse concentrado s6lo en
proyectos en el ambito rural, donde la posibilidad de filtraci6n es mucho menor que en el campo urbano. Es
decir que el estudio si sobrestima el exito en el campo de la focalizaci6n por restringirse a un tipo de
proyectos y un area de intervenci6n que, siendo sumamente representativa de la acci6n de FONCODES, no
es el integro, y donde los niveles de filtraci6n pueden ser menores que en el caso de las obras no
consideradas en el estudio. De otro lado, sobre la base de un estudio comparativo en ejecuci6n por el Banco
Mundial, y de anteriores estudios sobre la distribuci6n del gasto social entre los diferentes quintiles de la
poblaci6n, por niveles de ingresos, se sefial6 que, si bien los resultados de filtraci6n en general no son tan
bajos como los que se encuentran en la muestra analizad por el estudio de impacto y sostenibilidad, la
focalizaci6n geogrAfica realizada por FONCODES esta entre las dos mas efectivas de los programas del
Estado peruano en esta Area.
Tambien se discutieron opciones respecto de las mejores opciones de actualizaci6n de esta informaci6n
geografica. En general, hubo consenso relativo que el mapa de pobreza debiera manejarse centralmente a
nivel de distrito, y actualizarse peri6dicamente con cada censo. Se plantearon ideas en el sentido de que a
nivel local, se hiciera un mapa por tecnicas participativas que permitiese afinar la identificaci6n de zonas
-46-



pobres, sin quedar claro si el planteamiento implicaba llegar hasta la detemminaci6n de hogares, centros
poblados, comunidades o que otra unidad. Se plante6 que en este esfuerzo los gobiemos locales podrian
tener un tema que realizar.
Asimismo, se plantearon tambien cuestionamientos respecto de si el sistema demand driven excluye a
comunidades pobres con menor capacidad de organizaci6n o zonas mas alejadas, y que hacer al respecto.
Se discuti6 respecto de un rol de promoci6n de FONCODES en las zonas de este tipo, el cual no habia sido
realizado de manera activa.
Con respecto al tema especifico de la focalizaci6n individual a nivel de hogares, se plantearon opiniones en
el sentido de que ella no es necesaria, pues las obras de FONCODES son de beneficio comunal y no de
hogar, por lo que la naturaleza del proyecto hace que solo sea necesario focalizar a nivel de comunidad.
Por otro lado, y en favor de la focalizaci6n a nivel del hogar, se sostuvo que, si bien estas inversiones en
infraestructura son bienes puiblicos, tienen un impacto privado.
Finalmente, se podria sefialar que, para el caso de infraestructura basica, una conclusi6n mas o menos
consensual fue la de seguir focalizando geograficamente a nivel de distrito, pero mejorar los procesos de
actualizaci6n de data, y complementar esta focalizaci6n geografica con focalizaci6n a nivel de comunidad,
centro poblado, u hogares, mediante tecnicas participativas desarrolladas con apoyo de la comunidad
organizada y del municipio.
Respecto a la pregunta de si fue la desconcentraci6n de FONCODES suficiente para que las oficinas
zonales respondan a las demandas, se plantearon opiniones en el sentido de que no fue asi. Se hizo notar la
necesidad de compatibilizar la acci6n de FONCODES en el futuro con el proceso de descentralizaci6n que
posiblemente se llevara a cabo.
Con respecto a las oficinas zonales, se sefial6 que en la actualidad el problema es la asignaci6n de recursos
a cada una de las oficinas, y que seria necesario darles mAs autonomia para que puedan focalizar a las
comunidades mas pobres. Asimismo, que en las oficinas zonales hay un conocimiento de la poblaci6n, pero
que se requiere sistematizar y desarrollar una base de datos que sea coordinada con otras instituciones,
para no duplicar esfuerzos, enfatizandose la importancia de que participen los gobiemos locales.
Se reiter6 que existe un porcentaje importante de la poblaci6n rural (10-15%) que no vive en poblados en
los que FONCODES hace intervenciones. Deberia estudiar en que forma se pueden incluir en los
programas de focalizaci6n. Esto se podria solucionar con la descentralizaci6n si se diefian mecanismos
apropiados.
Un punto aparte, pero tambien importante, que se mencion6 fue que hay muchos proyectos que se realizan
porque la poblaci6n los demanda, pero que de acuerdo a los resultados de la evaluaci6n no tienen impacto.
Se planteo que deberia hacerse un esfuerzo por estudiar si hay algun beneficio que la evaluaci6n no esta
incorporando como los incentivos de empleo para construir infraestructura, para evaluar si este tipo de
obras se justifican, y c6mo podria optimizarse los recursos.
Proyectos Productivos
Con relacion a las caracteristicas de los proyectos productivos que se buscaria impulsar se
sefial6 lo siguiente:
Experiencias piloto
-47 -



* Se trata de proyectos que generen ingresos e incluyen obras de infraestructura economica y
otras actividades que pernitan sinergias y que incrementan la capacidad productiva y el
potencial de generar ingresos de manera sostenible para la poblaci6n pobre.
Proyectos con posible replicabilidad
Proyectos autosostenibles en el futuro
* Se debe combinar lugares con poblaci6n pobre, potencialidad productiva y mercados
disponibles.
Se basan en un modelo de intervenci6n y por lo tanto estaba acotado territorialmente.
Deben considerar el analisis de rentabilidad y riesgo.
En el taller existieron, fundamentalmente, dos posiciones divergentes. En primer lugar, aquellos que se
preguntaban: por que hablar de un mecanismo de focalizaci6n para un objetivo de FONCODES que auin no
se ha definido, considerando que primero habria que definir cual es la estrategia de lucha contra la pobreza
y c6mo seria el FONCODES futuro para luego pasar a analizar los mecanismos de focalizaci6n.
De otro lado, aquellos que pensaban que si seria uitil realizar el ejercicio de preguntarse como se deberian
focalizar los proyectos productivos, no importando si FONCODES o otra entidad los ejecutaba.
La relatoria se concentrarA en este ultimo grupo. Este consideraba que la evaluaci6n de lo que ya ha hecho
FONCODES ayudaria para evaluar las posibilidades de pasar a un FONCODES distinto que manejara
proyectos productivos dentro de un enfoque integrado, por lo que seria importante considerar qu& criterios
de focalizaci6n debieran seguirse.
Se sefial6 que la discusi6n de estos metodos de focalizaci6n se daria sobre la base de dos supuestos que
merecian discutirse mas a fondo, y que fueron motivo de varios cuestionamientos:
(i) el Estado debia realizar este tipo de actividades directamente
(ii) FONCODES era la entidad pertinente para realizarlo
Dados esos supuestos, se plante6 que la focalizaci6n no podria ser la misma que la de infraestructura
bAsica, pues a la existencia de pobreza debia sumarse las condiciones de potencialidades, mercado y
capacidad institucional. Algunos asistentes plantearon cuestionamientos importantes a la viabilidad de
realizar un instrumento de focalizaci6n geogrifica que pudiese cubrir todos estos aspectos con la calidad
debida.
Al respecto, los consultores a cargo de la evaluaci6n plantearon que no debia magnificarse esta dificultad,
pues existian tantas zonas de pobreza que podrian ser escogidas, que no se Ilega al problema de no poder
focalizar. Que, dada la limitaci6n de recursos, el niunero de zonas pobres que podrian ser atendidas con
programas de este tipo era limitado, por lo que la focalizaci6n no resultaba mayor problema.
Los cuestionamientos a este tipo de proyectos por parte del Estado, y en particular, de FONCODES
aludieron a las siguientes razones:
FONCODES s6lo tiene experiencia de proyectos piloto en base a oferta. La filosofia y la
experiencia de FONCODES en proyectos realizados en base a la demanda.
C6mo se compatibiliza este tipo de actividades con las que realiza el Ministerio de Agricultura.
El Estado en general no ha demostrado tener una buena performance en el manejo de este tipo
de proyectos.
- 48 -



Se plante6 la necesidad de estudiar el impacto logrado en programas de este tipo ya Ilevados a
cabo, tanto en otros organismos del Estado (MINAG; MITINCI) como por entes del sector
privado (ADEX-USAID,PRA-CONFIEP).
Se plante6 tambien que tal vez el rol del Estado sea s6lo acelerar el proceso y no ejecutarlos.

Additional Annex 10. Informe de Cierre de FONCODES II
CON VENIO DE PRESTAMO No 4068-PE-BIRF
INFORME DE CIERRE
L.     CONTEXTO DEL PROYECTO
1.1 Entorno econ6mico
Durante los altimos diez anios la economia peruana ha observado un periodo de crecimiento
econ6mico importante, excepto durante los ultimos tres afios en donde se ha registrado una marcada
desaceleraci6n como consecuencia de factores extemos como la crisis de Mexico, Brasil y Asia, que
afectaron la situaci6n macroecon6mica del pais y el Fen6meno del Nifio que destruyo gran parte de la
infraestructura del Pais
El crecimiento medio anual del producto percapita durante la ultima decada ha sido positivo, excepto
en el anio 1998 en donde fue negativo, alcanzando -1.4% como parte de la tendencia decreciente que
caracteriz6 en los Witimos afios 1998 y 1999.
Las reformas econ6micas y sociales iniciadas al comienzo de la decada contribuyeron a la
estabilizaci6n de la economia y la pacificaci6n del pais, que se tradujo especialmente entre 1993 y
1997, en un incremento del bienestar, como consecuencia del mejoramiento del entomo econ6mico y
el incremento del gasto percapita, observandose una tendencia decreciente entre 1998 y 1999, como
consecuencia de los factores de la crisis recesiva que atraves6 el Pais Los Estudios de Jesko
Hetschels "Poverty and Social Delopments in Peru 1994-1997" y los resultados de la ENNIV 1999
perfilan el comportamiento diferenciado en el crecimiento del producto percapita y el comportamiento
de la economia nacional.
1.2 Evoluci6n de la Pobreza
Durante 1995-1999, afios en que se ejecut6 el Programa, los indicadores de reducci6n de la pobreza
en el Pais muestran avances significativos en la ampliaci6n de la cobertura de necesidades basicas
insatisfechas, sin embargo por el lado del gasto o linea de pobreza no parece observarse una
reducci6n en los niveles de pobreza.
La poblaci6n que por lo menos ha cubierto el conjunto de necesidades basicas insatisfechas, entre
1995 y 1999 se ha incrementado del 51.1% al 60.4%, segun Informaci6n del INEI. Ello debido a
que la poblaci6n a logrado reducir el numero de necesidades basicas a traves de los diferentes
programas sociales iniciados durante el periodo El Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informantica
realiza la medici6n de las Necesidades Basicas Insatisfechas (NBI) mediante indicadores de:
viviendas con caracteristicas fisicas inadecuadas, hogares en hacinamiento, vivienda sin servicio
higienicos, hogares con al menos un ninio que no asiste a la escuela, hogares con jefe de hogar con
primaria incompleta, y hogares con tres o mas personas perceptoras de ingreso. La poblaci6n con al
menos una necesidad basica insatisfecha se redujo en 9.3 puntos entre 1995 y 1999.

La evoluci6n de la pobreza por el lado del gasto muestra una tendencia estable para los niveles de
pobreza total, mientras que la poblaci6n en extrema pobreza registra una ligera reducci6n. De
acuerdo a los resultados disponibles de informaci6n comparables de las Encuestas Nacionales de
Hogar que fueron aplicadas entre 1997 a 1999, la pobreza extrema se ha mantenido alrededor de los
37 %, en tanto que la poblaci6n en situaci6n de pobreza extrema se ha reducido en 1.40/c,, durante
dicho periodo Es importante senialar que los resultados preliminares de la ENNIV 2000, seiialan que
los niveles de pobreza total se han incrementado entre 1997 -2000, registrandose en el anio 2000, que
el 54.9% de la poblaci6n se encuentra en situaci6n de pobreza total, mientras que la poblaci6n en
situaci6n de pobreza extrema se ha mantenido alrededor del 14.8%.

Las cifras de 1997, 1998 y 1999 son comparables entre si, pero no lo son respecto a anios anteriores.
Los estudios han permitido ratificar tambien que los mayores niveles de pobreza extrema se
encuentran principalmente en las areas rurales del Pais, siendo las zonas rurales de sierra y selva las
mas criticas, en donde se presenta vulnerabilidad social por la brecha observada respecto a la linea de
pobreza. La ENAHO 1998 encontr6 que las mayores tasas se presentan en dichas areas, el 65.3%de
la poblaci6n en extrema pobreza se encuentra en la sierra rural, mientras que el 10% se encuentra en
la selva rural, que es significativo si se lo compara con la poblaci6n asentada en dicha area..
1.3 Rol de FONCODES en la Politica Social
El Fondo Nacional de Compensaci6n y Desarrollo Social (FONCODES), forma parte de la Red de
Instituciones del Sector Piblico que a partir de 1990 el Gobierno peruano diseft6 para la lucha contra
la pobreza. Fue creado en 1991 mediante el D. L. 657 del 15 de Agosto, que establece que es un
organismo publico descentralizado con autonomia financiera y depende de la Presidencia de la
Republica.
Su objeto es el mejoramiento de las condiciones y la calidad de vida de la poblaci6n pobres mediante
la atenci6n de sus necesidades basicas y la generaci6n de empleo. Para ello, financia un meniu de
vinculados a la asistencia social, infraestructura social, infraestructura econ6mica y desarrollo
productivo.
En el marco del Programa Gubernanental para la Estrategia Focalizada que orient6 de lucha contra
la pobreza durante 1996 y 2000, las acciones de FONCODES estuvieron dirigidas a la consolidaci6n
de la atenci6n de las necesidades sociales basicas y de infraestructura de la poblaci6n, principalmente
en el area rural de sierra y selva, con el objeto de contribuir a la reducci6n del 50% de la pobreza
extrema, senialado por el gobiemo como meta para el afio 2000.

2.3. Estrategia de Ejecuci6n
La estrategia general de ejecuci6n del Programa es el financiamiento de pequefios proyectos
presentados por las comunidades beneficiarias pobres, organizados en Nuicleo Ejecutores. Para ello
FONCODES ha establecido como parte de su mecanismo de operaci6n un conjunto de actividades
denominado ciclo de proyectos. En el anexo N I se muestra el ciclo de proyectos vigente.
Las lineas o tipos de proyectos elegibles del Programa se presentan en el Anexo N 2 .
Los Nuicleos Ejecutores, organismos de gesti6n de financiamiento y ejecuci6n de los proyectos, estAn
conformados por representantes de los beneficiarios y cuentan con el apoyo de un conjunto de agentes
de proyectos como son: proyectistas, evaluadores, inspectores, supervisores y capacitadores, estos
ultimos incorporados recientemente en el marco de la ejecuci6n del Programa.

3.3 Fortalecimiento Institucional
El Componente de Desarrollo Institucional, ha contribuido a financiar una serie de actividades para el
fortalecimiento de las acciones de modernizaci6n de los sistemas administrativos del FONCODES,
fundamentalnente para lograr una mejor accesibilidad de la poblaci6n mas pobre y el desarrollo de
actividades de mejoramiento del ciclo de proyectos que viabilicen los procesos descentralizaci6n de la
Sede Central hacia las Oficinas Zonales. Igualmente contribuy6 a la implantaci6n de las acciones de
capacitaci6n y transferencia para mejorar la sostenibilidad de los proyectos financiados.
Promocion y mejoramiento del ciclo delproyecto
Con el objeto de favorecer la accesibilidad de la Poblaci6n mas pobre, FONCODES actualmente ha
incorporado en el ciclo del proyecto, la presentaci6n de la solicitud de financiamiento, en vez del
expediente tecnico, que por su complejidad representan un alto costo para las poblaciones mas pobres
por el mayor riesgo del rechazo al momento de la evaluaci6n del proyecto.
Las actividades de promoci6n estuvieron operativizados principalmente por los Jefes de la Oficina
Zonales, en el marco de una estrategia de promoci6n focalizada y descentralizada hacia los distritos
de mayor pobreza, y que tienen menos posibilidades de presentar proyectos ante el Fondo y obtener el
financiamiento respectivo. Se estima que desde 1991 a la fecha, con los Agentes de Proyectos y Jefes
Zonales se han cubierto el 100 % de los Distritos calificados como de pobreza extrema, muy pobres y
pobres, que cuentan con localidades menores 400 viviendas (15,085 Distritos ), que fueron
considerados como prioritarios para ejecuci6n de acciones de promoci6n.
De otro lado y en lo que se refiere al proceso de priorizaci6n durante el segundo semestre de 1997 se
implant6 el sistema automatizado de jerarquizaci6n de proyectos, que utiliza el metodo multicriterio
denominado electre IV, el mismo que combina diferentes atributos de focalizaci6n de proyectos,
cobertura de atenci6n de la localidad y de costos para determinar el orden de atenci6n de los
proyectos de manera objetiva, rapida y transparente. Dicho sistema ha venido operando
satisfactoriamente y ha sido objeto de analisis de diferentes estudios contratados por FONCODES,
recomendandose para su optimizaci6n pequefios ajustes y rebalanceo para su mejoramiento.
Igualmente a fin de mejorar el proceso de evaluacion de proyectos en aspectos de impaclo se viene
implantando un sistema de evaluaci6n ambiental para los proyectos a lo largo del ciclo del proyecto,
el mismo que considera inicialmente la elaboracion de un diagn6stico ambiental para identificar la
situaci6n antes de la ejecuci6n proyecto, la posterior identificaci6n de los impactos ambientales, la
definici6n de las medidas de control ambiental necesarias y asegurar su cumplimiento en la etapa de
ejecuci6n. Este sistema pasa por un proceso final de monitoreo.
Descentralizacion
Durante la ejecuci6n del programa se ha consolidado el proceso de descentralizaci6n iniciado en el
anio 1994, que contempla la delegaci6n paulatina de facultades de la Sede Central hacia las Oficinas
Zonales, en las actividades del ciclo del proyecto.
Al inicio del programa se contaban con 14 Oficinas Zonales con facultades para la aprobaci6n de
proyectos, mientras que a junio del 2000 se tienen a 22 de las 23 Oficinas Zonales con facultades
para aprobaci6n de proyectos.
- 61 -



Para el mejoramiento de los sistemas automatizados y de comunicaciones entre la Sede central y las
Oficinas Zonales se han realizado adquisiciones de equipos de computo, en este sentido, en el primer
semestre del presente afio, se han adquirido servidores de datos, switch de comunicaciones y equipos
para el fortalecimiento de la integraci6n de los diferentes subsistemas y de los m6dulos de infommatica
tanto a nivel central como para el enlace a las Oficinas Zonales. Adicionalmente se ha adquirido el
servicio de la Red Digital de Servicios integrados a la Telef6nica. Se espera que a la culminaci6n del
proceso de implantaci6n, se facilite la integraci6n de los sistemas y procesos informaticos.
Capacitacion y Transferencias de obras para la sostenibilidad
Las actividades de capacitaci6n para la sostenibilidad de los proyectos se iniciaron a mediados del
afio 1997, habiendose priorizado inicialmente la capacitaci6n de los proyectos de agua potable y
riego, por las caracteristicas consideradas para su operacion y mantenimiento y el volumen de
inversi6n previsto por el Programa. La estrategia inicial, estuvo a cargo de los
supervisores-evaluadores. Posteriormente a partir de julio de 1999 y efectos de optimizar las acciones
de capacitaci6n se consider6 un agente adicional para el desarrollo de las actividades vinculadas a la
sensibilizaci6n y capacitaci6n de los aspectos sociales como genero, medio ambiente, y salud puiblica,
recayendo las actividades de capacitaci6n en los temas de operaci6n y mantenimiento de la obra en
los inspectores capacitadores. Al termino del Programa los proyectos que se han financiado con el
componente de capacitaci6n suman aproximadamente 3,502, que representan el 57% del total de
proyectos financiados de las lineas de agua potable y riego.
Adicionalmente y con el objeto de contribuir a la sostenibilidad de los proyectos, FONCODES ha
iniciado un proceso dirigido a lograr la transferencia formal de las obras, que contribuya a mejorar
los niveles de apropiaci6n por parte de los beneficiarios. En este sentido, mediante Ley No. 27171 de
fecha 31 de agosto de 1999, se declar6 de necesidad y utilidad el saneamiento fisico-legal y contable
de las obras de inversi6n social financiadas por el Fondo Nacional de Compensaci6n y Desarrollo
Social /FONCODES, asi como su transferencia en propiedad a las Entidades Receptoras,
responsables de su administraci6n y mantenimiento (Ministerio de Educaci6n, Ministerio de Salud,
Gobiemos Locales, Comunidades Campesinas, entre otras).En el primer semestre del presente afio se
ha iniciado dicho proceso mediante acciones de coordinaci6n y capacitaci6n sensibilizaci6n,
habiendose priorizado obras de saneamiento basico financiadas por el programa de la cooperaci6n
suiza, del ambito de las Oficinas Zonales de Abancay y Puno Programa de cooperaci6n suiza tiene
dos Proyectos/Programa de Recuperaci6n Agropecuaria en cuatro Microcuencas de la Provincias de
Aymaraes y Antabamba (Departamento de Apurimac) y el Proyecto /Programa de Agua Potable en
Zonas Altoandinas/, en el marco de un Plan Piloto, las cuales seran transferidas a Juntas
Administradoras de Agua creadas por la propia poblaci6n que cuentan con reconocimiento puiblico.
Igualmente se ha iniciado coordinaciones, en el marco con el Ministerio de Educaci6n y el Consejo
Transitorio de Administraci6n Regional de Chiclayo a traves del Vice-Ministerio de Desarrollo
Regional del Ministerio de la Presidencia.
Avance Financiero
Al 30 de junio del 2000 el componente de Fortalecimiento Institucional presenta una ejecuci6n de
US$6.6 millones de d6lares, que representan un avance del 79%. La ejecuci6n del prestamo N
4068-PE BIRF alcanza a US$3.1 millones mientras que la del BID a US$2.8 y la contribuci6n del
Gobiemo peruano a US$0.7 millones.

Como parte de las consultorias financiadas con el Componente de Fortalecimiento institucional se
han realizado diferentes estudios entre los mas importantes que se pueden destacar son los siguientes:
La Quinta Evaluaci6n   Ex-Post, la Evaluaci6n de Impacto y el Plan de Desarrollo Institucional.
FONCODES espera elaborar un Plan de Implantaci6n de recomendaciones que integren las
recomendaciones sugeridas por dichas consultorias.
IV. RESULTADOSEIMPACTO
4.1 Resultados
FONCODES es una de las instituciones que por su mecanismo de operaci6n se ha constituido una
entidad que ha fmanciado la mayor cantidad de pequefios proyectos y en el mayor numero de distritos
del Pais. Durante 1997 y 1999, aprob6 un promedio anual de 6,377 proyectos. Tiene costos
operativos alcanzaron un rango del 5 al 7.5% durante 1997 y 1998, coeficiente menor que los
observados en principales programas sociales del Pais. Los resultados de la evaluaci6n de costos es
presentada en el Analisis Costo Eficiencia de los Programas Sociales BIRF/FONCODES.
La distribuci6n de la inversi6n del programa por niveles de pobreza presenta resultados
satisfactorios, en tanto los mayores niveles de inversi6n se han registrado en los estratos mas pobres.
En los distritos de pobreza extrema, muy pobre y pobre, la inversi6n realizada por el Programa suma
el 97.6% de la inversi6n total realizada al 30.06.2000. Si se compara la poblaci6n distrital y la
inversi6n realizada del periodo, se puede confirmar que la orientaci6n de los recursos ha sido
satisfactoria, en tanto la inversi6n tiende a concentrase en los distritos de mayor pobreza.

En relaci6n al empleo se estima que el Programa aproximadamente gener6 17 millones de jornales de
mano de obra no calificada.
4.2. Impacto
De acuerdo con los resultados del estudio de impacto de los proyectos financiados por FONCODES,
realizado en el primer semestre del presente afio, a partir de una muestra de 570 proyectos y
- 66 -



utilizando grupos de comparaci6n, se puede concluir que los proyectos han tenido alguin impacto en
la poblaci6n beneficiaria.
Los proyectos en educaci6n contribuyeron a incrementar el promedio de 34 alumnos matriculados,
asi como la ampliaci6n de 1.6 grados en la escuela beneficiada.
Los proyectos de agua potable generan una reducci6n en la diarrea infantil en 3%, igualmente
incidieron en la reducci6n del tiempo promedio tipico en un 96 % en el caso de conexiones
domiciliarias y del 86% en el caso de viviendas con piletas.
Los proyectos de letrinas no parecen tener impacto en la incidencia de diarreas, salvo en el caso de
la diarrea aguda en nifios mayores a 6 afios en donde el impacto alcanza al 2.4%. Esto se explicaria
por la mayor probabilidad que tienen este grupo etareo respecto a nifios de menor edad.
Igualmente los proyectos de electrificaci6n indican que la autovaloraci6n de las viviendas un poco
mas de US$570 d6lares, siempre y cuando estos logren su conexi6n.
En los proyectos de riego y los proyectos de infraestructura vial que fueron analizados mediante un
estudio de casos, los primeros presentan un mayor nuimero de areas de riego generadas por la mayor
disponibilidad de agua y en el caso de los segundos el impacto puede explicarse por el mayor
conjunto de oportunidades y beneficios derivados del transporte de los productos agricolas
principalmente en epocas de cosecha, acceso a los mercados y llegada del transporte puiblico.
En cuanto a las actividades de capacitaci6n en proyectos de agua potable sobre 302 proyectos, la
Evaluaci6n de las acciones de capacitaci6n muestran resultados aceptables. El 94% de los proyectos
ftunciona o funcionan con algunos problemas, mientras que solamente el 3% funcionan con muchos
problemas y 3% no funcionan. Igualmente se registra que en los proyectos con hogares mas
capacitados hay un mejor funcionamiento de las obras, en tanto existe un menor nmunero de veces que
la obra se ha malogrado y funcionan con menor numero de problemas. No obstante, se observa que la
participaci6n de la comunidad en el mantenimiento de las obras tiende a ser mas reactiva que
preventiva, por cuanto solamente existe un nivel de significaci6n estadistica cuando se realizan
reparaciones de obra.
Finalmente, en relaci6n a la evaluaci6n de los proyectos productivos, la evaluaci6n intermedia
realizada entre los meses de febrero y mayo del presente afio, sefialan fortalezas y debilidades de la
estrategia de intervenci6n de FONCODES, que podrian ameritar el mejoramiento de la estrategia de
intervenci6n a fin de optimizar los resultados de los proyectos.
V. LECCIONES APRENDIDAS, LIMITA CIONES EN LA EJECUCON DEL PROGRAMA.
5.1 Lecciones Aprendidas
Fondo Eficientey Eficazpara transferir recursos
Al igual que todos los Fondos de Inversi6n Social implementados durante los ultimos diez afios, el
FONCODES se ha convertido en un instrumento efectivo y eficaz para la lucha contra la pobreza.
Desde su creaci6n hasta 30 de Junio del afio 2000, ha canalizado recursos por un monto de US$1,132
millones, dirigidos al financiamiento 40,968 pequefios proyectos de infraestructura social,
infraestructura econ6mica y desarrollo productivo. En el desarrollo de sus operaciones a alcanzado a
- 67 -



financiar por lo menos un proyecto en el 100% de los distritos calificados por el mapa de pobreza en
situaci6n de pobreza (muy pobres, pobres y muy pobres).
Dichas acciones han sido realizadas con costos operativos que se ubican entre el 5 y el 7% del
presupuesto institucional.
Su estrategia de intervencidn privilegia la participacidon comunitaria
La participaci6n de la poblaci6n en la gesti6n del financiamiento y ejecuci6n de los proyectos a traves
del Nucleo Ejecutor, legitimiza las necesidades de financiamiento y mejora la sostenibilidad de los
proyectos, contribuyendo a una mayor apropiaci6n del mismo. Igualmente, en el largo plazo,
contribuye a la formaci6n de liderazgos comunales para fortalecer las capacidades locales de gesti6n.
Manejo de cartera diversificada de proyectos
A diferencia de otras entidades del sector publico, que intervienen en la ejecuci6n de programas
antipobreza, FONCODES ofrece financiamiento para un conjunto de proyectos que potencialmente
puede ajustarse a las necesidades locales de las poblaciones rnas pobres. Las lineas de inversion que
se financian corresponden a mas de 20 tipos de proyectos en areas de asistencia social,
infraestructura social y desarrollo productivo.
Necesidad de una integracidn del Fondo con procesos m as amplios de modernizacidn del Estado.
El FONCODES al haber desarrollado una capacidad institucional a traves de Nuicleo Ejecutor, para
recoger las legitimas expresiones de necesidades sociales, puede contribuir activamente en el proceso
de modemizaci6n del Estado y hacer mas eficiente la inversi6n publica mediante asociaciones con los
Ministerios Sectoriales y Autoridades Municipales. Las estructuras administrativas simplificadas del
fondo y la utilizaci6n eficaz de los mecanismos de tercerizaci6n de actividades pueden servir como
referencia para procesos de reformas que se realicen en cada uno de los Ministerios y Entidades
Gubemamentales Locales.
5.3 Limitaciones en la ejecucidn del Programa
Retrasos en la asignaci6n de los recursos
Durante 1998 la economia peruana fue afectada por crisis intemacionales que repercutieron en la
situaci6n macroecon6mica del pais, traduciendose en la reducci6n de la disponibilidad de recursos
que limitaron la inversi6n publica, entre ellas la canalizada a traves del FONCODES. Debido a las
limitaciones de recursos de contrapartida, no se utiliz6 un monto de US$25.6 millones provenientes
del prestamo concertado con el BIRF, a pesar de que inicialmente el plazo de ejecuci6n se ampli6
hasta 31 de diciembre de 1999 y posteriormente hasta el 30 de junio del 2000.
Insuficiente avance en el proceso de modernizacidn del Estado que fomente la coordinaci6n
institucional
Es de esperar que el proceso de modernizaci6n institucional deberia fomentar entre otros aspectos la
eliminaci6n de los elementos que dificultan la complementariedad y eviten la duplicidad de acciones a
traves del establecimiento de mecanismos e instrumentos que contribuyan a mejorar los niveles de
coordinaci6n institucional. Desde 1994 FONCODES ha celebrado diferentes convenios de
- 68 -



cooperaci6n interinstitucional con entidades del sector publico dirigidos a coordinar y complementar
sus acciones, sin embargo las limitaciones generadas en la falta de claridad en los objetivos
institucionales de las instituciones del sector puiblico y las estrategias diferenciadas de intervenci6n
que se tienen muchas veces limitan el desarrollo de las coordinaciones interinstitucionales y fomentar
competencias que obstaculizan una acci6n eficiente.
La limitada cobertura de los Ministerios genero limites en el cambio de la composicion de la
cartera de proyectos
El Informe de Evaluaci6n del Programa (SAR) consider6 que las acciones del FONCODES estarian
dirigidas hacia un cambio gradual de la cartera de proyectos a favor de los proyectos relacionados.
con los temas productivos, a partir de un mayor incremento de las acciones de los Ministerios hacia
los sectores sociales en el ambito rural.
La limitada ampliaci6n de la cobertura de los Ministerios, hizo que dichas metas globales se
consideren ambiciosas para el programa, motivo por el cual FONCODES continu6 recibiendo
demandas de financiamiento de obras de los sectores sociales y que finalmente incidieron en una
mayor ejecuci6n de los proyectos de infraestructura social.
Adicionalmente, es probable que la poblaci6n privilegiara la demanda de proyectos de infraestructura
social en vez de los de infraestructura econ6mica por cuanto en el primero de ellos se realizaba el
pago por la contribuci6n comunal de mano de obra no calificada, en desmedro de los proyectos de
infraestructura econ6mica en donde no se pagaba.
VI. MISIONES DEL BID Y BIRF
Durante la ejecuci6n del Proyecto diferentes Misiones del BID y el BIRF. Dichas Misiones realizaron
importantes sugerencias para apoyar la ejecuci6n del Programa.
Entre el 27 y 30 de Junio del presente afio, se realizo la Misi6n del BIRF con motivo de cierre del
Programa, que entre otras temas recomend6 revisar:
La necesidad de mejorar las actividades de control y seguimiento mediante la implementaci6n de
un Programa regular de visitas.
*   Procesos de preinversi6n en el ciclo del proyecto
*   Promoci6n y capacitaci6n
*   Asesoria Legal.
Se espera que el Fondo elabore un Plan de Implantaci6n de dichas recomendaciones, y que
adicionalmente con las sugerencias que se deriven de la Evaluaci6n de impacto y otras consultorias
recientemente concluidas, se integren en un instrumento orientador para el mejoramiento de las
acciones del FONCODES.
VII. CONCLUSIONES YRECOMENDAClONES
7.1 Conclusiones
1.  El Proyecto ha contribuido a mejorar las condiciones de vida de la poblaci6n mas pobre del
pais, mediante la dotaci6n de infraestructura social. Los resultados del estudio de impacto realizado
durante el primer semestre del presente anio determinan efectos que abundan en ese sentido.
- 69 -



2.  La  estrategia de Ejecuci6n del FONDO ha continuado mejorandose respecto al primer
programa financiado por el BIRF, en tanto se han mejorado actividades del ciclo del proyecto,
dirigidas a mejorar la accesibilidad de los beneficiarios, la descentralizaci6n del Fondo. Igualmente se
ha implementado un programa de capacitaci6n y de transferencia formnal de obras que permitan
mejorar la sostenibilidad de los proyectos financiados.
3.  Las restricciones presupuestarias generadas por fen6menos extemos que afectaron la economia
nacional durante 1998, han sido un factor determinante para que el proyecto no pueda cumplir con la
utilizaci6n total del financiamiento comprometido con el BIRF, por cuanto contribuyeron a reducir la
inversi6n publica, canalizada por FONCODES por las dificultades en la asignacion de la
contrapartida necesaria para la ejecuci6n del programa.
7.2 Recomendaciones
1.  Que las sugerencias de las diferentes consultorias sean integradas en un Plan Institucional que
permita su implantaci6n a efectos de preparar al FONCODES para nuevos retos en la Politica Social
del pais.

Comentarios al Informe de Cierre
1. Numeral 3.1 Objetivo
(Tercer Parrafo)
. Tambien que la expectativa que podia haber coordinacion con los Ministerios fue
irreal, lo cual fue un problema permanente en el Peru desde que el Banco reabri6 sus
Operaciones en 1992".
Comentario
Con el prop6sito evitar la duplicidad de acciones y facilitar la complementariedad e
integralidad de estas en la lucha contra la pobreza, desde 1994 FONCODES ha celebrado
diferentes convenios de cooperaci6n interinstitucional con entidades del sector publico. Los
convenios que se han suscrito son los siguientes: con el Ministerio de Educaci6n, el INFES,
Ministerio de Salud, Ministerio de Agricultura, PRONAMACHCS y el Ex - FONAVI.
Por otro lado FONCODES desde 1995 ha venido transfiriendo gradualmente diversas
facultades de la Sede Central a favor de las Oficinas Zonales. Dicha medida ha contribuido a
fortalecer las coordinaciones interinstitucionales a nivel descentralizado, en raz6n de que los
procesos de intercambio de informaci6n y opiniones sobre los proyectos prioritarios en los
:imbitos locales, podian ser facilmente incorporados en el Fondo por el nivel de autonomia en
la aprobaci6n de proyectos y selecci6n de los agentes.
En este sentido, FONCODES ha desarrollado esfuerzos para facilitar los niveles de
coordinaci6n necesarios, no obstante es probable que su dinamizaci6n tambien este en fiunci6n
de procesos de modernizaci6n del Estado y los niveles de descentralizaci6n del Pais, que
permitan una mayor precisi6n en la estructura organica de las instituciones del Sector I'ublico
para establecer los mecanismos que faciliten las coordinaciones institucionales y la
responsabilidad que de ellas se generen.
2. Numeral 3.3 Componentes Originales
(Tercer Parrafo)
"Por otro lado la expectativa de que los ministerios podian aumentar su capacidad en
atender los sectores sociales con infraestructura en areas rurales, no fue posible. Por esta
raz6n las metas especificas para este primer componente fueron demasiado ambiciosas....
Comentario
El SAR consider6 que las acciones del FONCODES II estarian dirigidas hacia un cambio
gradual de la cartera de proyectos a favor de los proyectos relacionados con los temas
productivos, a partir de un mayor incremento de las acciones de los ministerios de los sectores
sociales en el ambito rural, debido a lo cual se suponia que el Programa alcanzase el 100% de
las necesidades de cobertura en la infraestructura educativa primaria, acerca del 50 % de las
necesidades de agua potable y sistemas de alcantarillado y aproximadamente el 20 %/o de las
necesidades de electricidad.
La limitada ampliaci6n de la cobertura de los ministerios hizo que dichas metas globales se
consideren ambiciosas para el programa, motivo por el cual FONCODES continu6 recibiendo
- 71 -



demandas de financiamiento de obras de los sectores sociales y que finalmente incidieron en
una mayor ejecuci6n de los proyectos de infraestructura social.

alcantarillado no parecen que hayan tenido impacto .... "
Comentario
Si bien es cierto los resultados mostrados son producto del informe preliminar de la
evaluaci6n de impacto realizada por el Instituto Apoyo, dichas conclusiones deben ser
tomadas en el contexto adecuado en cuanto a su nivel de precisi6n, en la medida que estas
responden a encuestas de hogares en donde los informantes tienen limitaciones para generar
informacion precisa sobre temas como reducci6n de diarrea y otros aspectos sanitarios, que
muchas requieren de un conocimiento tecnico.
Igualmente, en cuanto a impacto de los proyectos de alcantarillado es importante que para una
mejor precision e interpretaci6n de los datos se diferencie los resultados de los sistemas que
cuentan instalaciones interiores de desague y sistemas sin instalaciones interiores. El impacto
que pareciese no haberse alcanzado podria deberse a la no ejecucion de las conexiones que
estan a cargo de los beneficiarios, debido a que generalmente son poblaciones en situaci6n de
pobreza y en consecuencia en futuras operaciones financiar las conexiones domiciliarias con
cargo al Programa como el FONCODES lo ha venido planteando.
Dicha recomendaci6n ha sido discutida con la consultora encargada de realizar la evaluacion
de impacto, a efectos que dicha recomendacion se incorpore en el Informe Final del Estudio.
4. Numeral 4.1 Gesti6n /Logros de Objetivos
(Octavo Parrafo)
"La evaluacion intermedia de los proyectos productivos (pilotos) muestran un numero de
deficiencias .... "
Comentario
Los proyectos productivos son iniciativas dirigidas a constituir fondos rotatorios para atender
las necesidades de asistencia tecnica y pequenos creditos solidarios, que contribuyan al
incremento de los niveles de vida de la poblaci6n pobre mediante el desarrollo de sus
capacidades productivas.
La evaluacion intermedia de los proyectos productivos realizada entre los meses de febrero y
mayo del presente afio por la Consultora CIMA S.A. sefialan fortalezas y debilidades de la
estrategia de intervenci6n de FONCODES para con los proyectos productivos, a partir de un
- 72 -



conjunto de 11 Racimos Estrategicos de Desarrollo Rurales (RED Rural) implementados a
nivel piloto. Aun cuando las limitaciones sefialadas pudieran haber influido en los resultados
econ6micos negativos de 4 de los 11 RED's evaluados, encontrados por el estudio, es
importante destacar que estos se debieron al alto riesgo de la actividad agricola y los factores
imprevistos que se presentaron, como el fen6meno de El Nifno y la fluctuaci6n de precios de
los productos agricolas (principalmente papa), que fue un factor que afect6 a todos los
productores del Pais, durante el primer semestre de este afio.
La consultora sefiala en el estudio que parece "necesario introducir algunas modificaciones en
el disefio si se plantea la ampliaci6n de la aplicaci6n del Modelo RED a proyectos de
desarrollo productivo en otras areas del Perud".
5. Numeral 4.2 Resultados por Componentes-Sub-proyectos basados en la comunidad.
(Segundo Parrafo)
"FONCODES aprobo entre 1997 a junio del 2000, un total de 19,431 proyectos pero
financiados 17,863 proyectos por restricciones presupuestales...."
Comentario
FONCODES aprob6 entre 1997 a junio del 2000, un total de 19,431 proyectos pero financi6
17,863 proyectos por restricciones presupuestales. Del total de proyectos financiados, con los
recursos del FONCODES II se cubrio el 100% del financiamiento de 12,655 proyectos y se
iniciaron 1,743 proyectos con algun desembolso, que seran concluidos con los recursos del
BID y el Tesoro Publico. Los desembolsos pendientes suman aproximadamente US$10.8
millones.
Es importante sefialar tambien, que el costo promedio de los proyectos fmanciados
(US$27,000 aproximadamente) fue menor a lo sefialado por el SAR (US$46.700) en raz6n a
que el costo promedio sefialado por el SAR para el FONCODES II proyectaba un cambio
gradual de los proyectos de infraestructura social a infraestructura productiva. Al mostrar los
proyectos de infraestructura social  una menor participaci6n que los proyectos de
infraestructura productiva al termino de la ejecuci6n del Programa, los costos promedios se
redujeron. Al respecto cabe sefialar que los proyectos de infraestructura productiva, tales
como Trochas Carrozables, Canales de Riego, tienen un costo de S/.114,961 y S/. 109,428
respectivamente, mientras que los costos promedios de los Proyectos de Infraestructura
Social, como sistemas de agua potable y centros educativos, son de aproximadamente
S/.64,293 y S/. 76,661, respectivamente.

"El sistema de Informaci6n Gerencial (MIS) fue desarrollado al punto de tener m6dulos
independientes para las diferentes partes del ciclo del proyecto. Pero FONCODES afront6
un numero de dificultades tecnicas en la integraci6n de este proceso. Por ello, el MIS nunca
logr6 la meta establecida de facilitar la descentralizaci6n teniendo un sistema integrado y
quefuera accesible a las oficinas Zonales"

Comentario
A traves de la licitaci6n Publica Intemacional N 01-2000 FONCODES, financiada con los
recursos del Prestamo N' 4068- PE del Banco Mundial y realizada entre los meses de Febrero
y Junio del presente afio se han adquirido servidores de datos, switch de comunicaciones y
equipos para el fortalecimiento de la integraci6n de los diferentes subsistemas y de los
modulos de informatica tanto a nivel central como para el enlace a las Oficinas Zonales.
Adicionalmente se ha adquirido el servicio de la Red Digital de Servicios integrados a la
Telef6nica. Se espera que a la culminaci6n del proceso de implantaci6n, se facilite la
integraci6n de los sistemas y procesos informaticos.
Paralelamente FONCODES mediante una consultoria de corta duraci6n viene definiendo
indicadores asociados al MIS, estimandose que sean culminados en mes de Diciembre del
presente afio. A traves de ella se ha previsto definir indicadores de insumo, resultados y de
impacto para los proyectos de infraestructura, Asistencia Social y Desarrollo Productivo.

8. Numeral 4.2 Resui'Ados por Componentes-Desarrollo Institucional (Cuarto Parrafo).
"Este componentefinancio un numero de estudios (ver la lista Anexa).en la mayoria de los
casos, con solicitudes realizadas al Banco. Las recomendaciones presentadas de estos
estudios nofueron siempre incorporadas dentro delproceso institucional."
Comentario
Con el componente Desarrollo institucional se financiaron diferentes estudios, entre los
principales que se pueden destacar son la Quinta Evaluaci6n Ex-Post, que fue realizada entre
octubre de 1998 y marzo de 1999, el Plan de Desarrollo Institucional, que se realiz6 entre los
meses de Marzo y Junio del presente afio y la Evaluaci6n de Impacto (Sexta Evaluaci6n
Ex-Post) cuyo informe final se viene actualmente revisando.
Con el prop6sito de incorporar las recomendaciones de la Quinta Evaluaci6n Ex-Post en
Octubre de 1999, FONCODES formul6 el Plan correspondiente, que entre otros aspectos
consideraron dar especial atencion a las actividades de promoci6n, transferencia de obras a las
comunidades, revisi6n del proceso de priorizaci6n (ELECTRE IV) y la implementaci6n de la
nueva plataforma informatica.
- 74 -



En relaci6n a las actividades de promoci6n FONCODES ha venido ejecutando diferentes
actividades de promoci6n las mismas que han estado vinculadas a los proyectos productivos,
habiendose realizados diferentes eventos de promoci6n en Limatambo (Cusco), Cojata (Puno),
Chazuta (Tarapoto) y Sonche-Utcubamba (Chachapoyas).
Igualmente se han realizado diferentes eventos para sensibilizar el proceso de transferencia.
Con respecto al proceso de transferencia de obras financiadas se viene implementando un Plan
de Transferencia. Igualmente se ha realizado un analisis mas detallado del Sistema de
Priorizaci6n que actualmente FONCODES, en el marco de la consultoria contratada para la
elaboraci6n del Plan de Desarrollo Institucional.
Se espera que luego de la culminacion de la Evaluaci6n de Impacto FONCODES formule un
nuevo Plan General para la implementaci6n de las recomendaciones sugeridas por los estudios
recientemente concluidos.
9. Numeral 4.5 Impacto de Desarrollo Institucional
(Segundo Parrafo)
"FONCODES dejo de utilizar el mapa de pobreza para la asignaci6n de recursos, por lo
que se tuvo que monitorear para asegurar que en la medida de lo posible estas
comunidades localizadas dentro de los distritos pobres y extremos pobres, fueron
correctamente beneficiadas. Adicionalmente al inicio del proyecto, fue instalado un sistema
para priorizar los proyectos presentados en las Oficinas Zonales. Este sistema fue para
asegurar que la mayoria de comunidades atendidas estuvieran en careas de extrema de
pobreza. Este sistema oper6 eficientemente por aproximadamente un aro.

FONCODES permanentemente ha priorizado la asignaci6n de recursos en los distritos
clasificados como muy pobres, pobres y regulares por el mapa de pobreza. Durante el periodo
1997 al 30 de Junio 2000. La inversi6n realizada en los distritos pobres, muy pobres y
pobres fue del 97.3% mientras que solamente 3.3% canalizada a los distritos regulares y
aceptables. La inversi6n en estas dos iltimas categorias fundamentalmente es explicada
debido a que al interior de los distritos existen areas socioecon6micas diferenciadas que
pueden calificarse como en situaci6n de pobreza.
La focalizaci6n al interior de los distritos, se viene realizando fundamentalmente en base a la
clasificaci6n de los espacios territoriales en zonas rurales y urbanas, prior izandose las
localidades rurales que tienen entre 40 y 400 viviendas.
La focalizaci6n al interior de los distritos es un tema que ha viene siendo discutida respecto al
tipo y los alcances de instrumento a utilizarse con otras instituciones normativas, como son el
Ministerio de la Presidencia, Ministerio de Economia y Finanzas y el Instituto Nacional de
Estadistica e Infonnrtica. Auin cuando no existe ningon instrumento uniforme.  El
FONCODES durante 1996 realiz6 una encuesta a 16,000 centros poblados entre 40 y 400
viviendas, la misma que ha proporcionado informaci6n importante sobre las necesidades de
infraestructura que permitan identificar aquellas localidades con mayores necesidades de
infraestructura.

Actualmente a efectos de mejorar el proceso de focalizaci6n, FONCODES viene elaborando
un nuevo mapa de pobreza a partir de un conjunto de indicadores actualizado de indicadores
de desnutrici6n, deficit de postas de salud, disponibilidad de infraestructura vial y acceso a los
servicios sociales basicos.
En relaci6n al sistema automatizado de priorizaci6n de solicitudes de proyectos que utiliza
FONCODES, cabe seiialar que este estA basado en un sistema de clasificaci6n numerica
denominada ELECTRE IV, el cual se implant6 en 1997. Dicho sistema viene ha venido
funcionando sin interrupciones. Tal es asi, que en el marco de la 5ta. Evaluaci6n Ex -Post
dicho sistema fue evaluado, recomendandose realizar un estudio mas profundo respecto a la
selecci6n de los atributos utilizados y la ponderaci6n asignada a cada una de las lineas de
inversi6n, habiendose recomendado por ello un analisis detallado. Posteriormente en el marco
del Plan de Desarrollo Institucional se realizo dicho analisis recomendandose procedimnientos
para su ajuste y rebalanceo.
10. Numeral 6.1 Avances Basicos que califican la sostenibilidad
(Primer Parrafo)
"En el caso de las escuelas, la Asociaci6n de Padres de familia ...... La Evaluaci6n de
Impacto muestra que ellos participan en el mantenimiento, pero es mas frecuente en los
proyectos antiguos".
Comentario
De acuerdo a los resultados de la Evaluaci6n de Inpacto la mayor participaci6n de las
Asociaciones de Padres de Familia en los proyectos antiguos probablemente se debe a que
estos requieren mayores niveles de mantenimiento. La versi6n preliminar de la evaluaci6n
de Impacto sefiala al respecto ".. los padres de familia empiezan a participar a la medida
que las aulas se deterioran con un enfoque mas reactivo que preventivo".

(Todo el Parrafo Unico)
"Parte del proceso para asegurar la sostenibilidad es la transferencia formal de los
proyectos ... El proceso de transferencia ha sido iniciado con los colegios. En el caso de
saneamiento basico, las Juntas Administradoras serdn creadas durante el proceso de
transferencia."

Comentario
Parte del proceso para asegurar la sostenibilidad es la formalizaci6n de la propiedad de
los proyectos financiados por FONCODES a favor de las partes responsables (Minmsterio
de Educaci6n, Ministerio de Salud, Gobiernos Locales, Comunidades Campesinas. entre
otras). Mediante Ley aprobada en agosto de 1999 se declar6 de necesidad y utilidad
puiblica la Transferencia de Obras financiadas por FONCODES. Los dispositivos que le
dan operatividad a dicha Ley fueron publicados en abril y mayo del 2000. El proceso de
Transferencia ha sido iniciado con obras de saneamiento basico del ambito de las
Oficinas Zonales de FONCODES de Abancay y Puno, las cuales seran transferidas a
Juntas Administradoras de Agua creadas por la propia poblaci6n que cuentan con
reconocimiento publico.
