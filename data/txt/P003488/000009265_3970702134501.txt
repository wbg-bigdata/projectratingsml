MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A RED SOILS AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
People's Republic of China for SDR 34.0 million (US$40.0 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be an standard IDA tenms
and would assist in financing a project to develop land and improve agricul-
tural infrastructure in two provinces in southeastern China.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock,
forestry and fisheries, provides sustenance to over one billion people, is the
source of income for some 190 million farm families, and accounts for about
35% of the country' s GDP. Only about 100 million of China's 960 million ha
are arable. Farming systems are intensive, with large inputs of labor,
chemical and organic fertilizers and water. Nearly half the arable land is
irrigated. Food grains occupy about 70% of the cropland and account for about
one-third of total agricultural output. This intensive farming system allows
China to meet the basic food requirements of its population (about 22% of the
world's total) from less than 8% of the world's arable land. Major changes in
farm policies since 1979, most importantly a shift from collective to family
farming and major increases in farm prices, have led to rapid growth and
diversification in agricultural production. The system of contracting out
production to small-scale family farms has given farmers more flexibility in
determining what crops to grow, bow much to produce and where to market their
output. Results have been dramatic: production increased by 102 per year
over the period 1980-85 in comparison with an average of 3% per year in the
preceding 23 years.  Grain output reached a record 407 million tons in 1984,
34% greater than in 1978, despite a reduction in the area sown with grains.
In 1985, responding to growing surplus stocks, the Government began a new
phase of reform, replacing compulsory procurement quotas with voluntary
contracts, adjusting procurement prices and greatly enlarging the role of the
market. These measures contributed to a decline in grain and cotton area and
output as farmers increasingly shifted production into livestock and other
cash crops.  As the current reforms are extended, the challenge to China's
v         agriculture will be to maintain an adequate growth rate while continuing to
improve consumption patterns. In terms of the average Chinese diet, Chinese
planners project a rapid increase in the demand for fruits, vegetables, meat,
poultry, fish and dairy prouacts with a corresponding decrease in the share of
direct grain consumption.
3.        China's "red soils areas", so named because of their characteristic
red or yellow subsoil colors, cover two million sq km, or 21% of China's total
surface area, in eleven provinces south of the Yangtze River. Favorable
climatic and rainfall conditions give the area potential for producing many
elements of a more diversified agriculture. However, the river basins and
delta areas, with their alluvial soils and extensive dike and irrigatiou
systems, are already occupied with highly productive paddy rice cultivation.

-2-
The Government, therefore, has focussed attention in recent years on formulat-
ing a development strategy for the uplands designed to bring into productive
use about ten million ha of underutilized land which is suitable for estab-
lishment of orchards and other tree crops, feed crop cultivation, pastures,
and comuercifl forest plantations. About eight million ha of this total
represent cultivated areas which have very low yields due to the inadequacy of
irrigation, erosion protection, and fertility improvement measures. Another
2.3 million ha in remote and underpopulated areas are presently unutilized but
can be economically developed for cultivation if proper soil improvement and
conservation measures are introduced. Large tracts of low-yielding or idle
land which have considerable productive potential are found in the uplands of
J'angxi Province with smaller, scattered tracts in Fujian Province.
4.        Project Objectives.  The main objective of the proposed project
would be to demonstrate efficient methods of developing the productive
potential of presently unutilized land in the red soil areas of south China.
The project would introduce cultivation of cash crops and livestock production
under individual household management in six coun:ies and two state farms in
Jiangxi Province and five counties and two municipalities in Fujian Province,
and would improve infrastructure and support services in these areas.
5.        Project Description.  The project to be carried out over five years
would support: (a) de-elopment of about 27,000 ha of idle land through
terracing, concour planting, onrfarn irrigation and drainage, and construction
of farm access roads; (b) improvement or extension of existing infrastructure,
including enlargement of small reservoirs, canal construction, installation of
pumping stations and sprinkler :rrigation systems, rural electrification, road
and bridge construction; (c) construction of about 343,000 sq m of buildings,
including housing, schools and clinics, administrative buildings, warehouses,
laboratories and extension stations, and livestock sheds; (d) provision of
construction and farm machinery as well as trucks and other vehicles required
for land dcevelopment, support services and management; (e) development of more
than 22,000 ha of cultivated area with planting of fruit, ramie, feed grains,
fodder crops, and woodlots as well as rehabilitation of low yield tea planta-
tions, including provision of seeds and some 32,000 tons of fertilizer;
(f) provision of purebred stock and feed for dairy and pig breeding farms and
specialized households; (g) rehabilitation or new construction of agroproces-
sing factories; (h) provision of equipment to upgrade and enlarge the existing
extension system; as well as training, study tours, and technical assistance
to project management organizations and agrotechnical service agencies; and
(i) a pilot program of research and demonstration to be conducted on areas of
more marginal red soils.
6.        The total r.ost of the project is estimated at US$122.2 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$40.5 million (33%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement
schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. Three maps showing project locations are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6072-CHA dated August 1, 1986, is
being distributed separately.



7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The major rationale for IDA support
is that the project provides a well-prepared, innovative and workable model of
environmentally sound land development which can be replicated elsewhere in
China. The land development scheme, featuring broad terracing along the
contours, well-designed irrigation and drainage systems, protective afforesta-
tion, and integration of chemical and organic means of soil improvement,
combines techniques individually proven in earlier trials in China. The sites
selected are those most economical to develop; however, the inclusion of less
*          favorable sites in a pilot program would increase the demonstration value for
other red soils areas. This is the first Bank-supported agricultural project
in China that would: (a) fully integrate land development, raw material
production and processing; (b) introduce new approaches to China's dairy
industry, such as reliance on household dairy farming  (c) attempt nearly
complete cost recovery through subloans to farmers and enterprises; (d) be
coordinated by an interprovincial commission, with minimal central government
supervision; and (e) be based on specialized household farm management. This
project would also be the first to be primarily managed by Agricultural
Development Corporations (ADCs) r4hich are state-owned autonomous entities.
The ADC is a relatively new form of organization in China and has been created
as a means of separating the provincial government's normal administrative and
extension functions from project management and conmercial activities.
8.        Agreed Aktions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions; (a) preparation of a plan for provision of chemical fertilizers
sufficient to meet annual crop nutrient requirements and submission of the
plan to the Association for review prior to November of each year;
(b) detailed study of the tech.nical and financial feasibility of project-
financed agroprocessing facilities to be carried out and submitted for review
by IDA prior to approval of any investments; (c) maintenance of provincial
project offices, as well as the Joint Coordinating Comnittee Secretariat,
during project implementation with staff, functions and responsibilities
acceptable to the Association; (d) continuous monitoring by ADCs of farm
budgets and family incomes, and annual review of findings with the Associa-
tion; (e) sublending by the ADCs to farmers and enterprises at interest rates
that are the same as the prevailing Agricultural Bank of China rates,
currently between 5.6% and 10.08X p.a., for similar loans for similar purposes
(the proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Jiangxi and Fujian
Provincial Governments for a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at
an interest rate of 4% p.a. and passed to the ADCs on the same terms, with
end-users bearing the foreign exchange risk, except for individual farmers
where the risk is borne by the provinces); and (f) restrict use of any net
cash accruals by ADCs, due to differences in timing between subloan repayments
to the ADCs and repayments by the ADCs to the provincial governments, to
financing agricultural development or agroprocessing activities.
9.        Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected primarily from increases in agricultural production and productivity
which in turn will increase the average per capita income of the largely
household farm beneficiaries by 330% at full project development (from an
average per capita income of $114 in 1986 to $490 in 2000). Project land
development would generate about 41,000 full-time jobs. The project's overall
economic rate of return (ERR) is 29%, ranging from 13% for the Provincial and



- 4 -
Red Star dairy breeding farms to 36-37% for household pig breeding. The ERRs
for the main farming activities generally exceed 20%. Forestry, which
typically suffers from the long gestation period before most benefits are
realized, is an acceptable exception (16-17%). The two dairy breeding farms
would provide breeding and technical support not only to project dairy
households, but other dairy farms in south China; the economic analysis omits
these indirect benefits, hence the 13% ERRs for their project activities are
considered satisfactory. Sensitivity of the ERRs for each activity was tested
to shortfalls from projected yields or prices, cost overruns, and increases in
the economic cost of labor.  No single variant proved crucial to the economic
viability of the project as a whole or to any major production activity.
10.       Risks. The project faces no significant technical, marketing or
organizational risks. The land development program would combine methods
which have been locally tried and proven, and apply them to red soils sites
selected for their ease of development. Local farmers have considerable
experience with the crops to be grown, .and the existing breeding farms have
the expertise required to train the dairy and pig raising farmers. The
agricultural goods to be produced under the project have large and rapidly
growing domestic markets. The successful track record in implementation of
IDA-funded land development projects in China indicates that project imple-
menting organizations belonging to local government have been able to
coordinate a work program involving multiple agencies. In this project, the
need for a high degree of coordination has been substantially removed by
building this coordination into the structure of the ADCs. The Jiangxi
Provincial ADC has been an implementing agency for three Bank Group financed
agriculture projects in that province, and consiaerable technical assistance
and training is provided under this project for both the two provincial ADCs
and their constituent county level branches. The use of ADCs as implementing
agencies whose longevity and income depend entirely or successful project
implementation thus promises further improvement on this record.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SOR.  In scme cases,
therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the original principal credit
amount expressed in dollars.

Country Brief
(for circulation with
Report No. P-4378-CHA)
CHINA
I. THE ECONOMY
1.        A country economic report entitled, "China: Long-Term Issues and
Options" (No. 5206-CHA) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 22, 1985.  Basic data on the economy are given in an Annex.
Backgro und
2.        Since 1978, China has initiated economic reforms in both rural and
urban areas and in the external sector. Reforms have thus far progressed the
farthest in the rural economy. Following some experiments with the abolition
of collective farming in impoverished areas, the Government implemented a
comprehensive restructuring of rural institutions based on various forms of
the "production responsibility system". By 1983 the farm household had become
the fundamental unit of management and production in agriculture, within a
framework of collective or state ownership of land and major fixed assets.
Reforms are now proceeding in the urban economy, and there have been signifi-
cant changes in enterprise management and finance. The scope for collective
and individual economic activities has been enlarged, and state enterprises
have been allowed greater freedom in production, pricing and marketing above
their mandatory plan targets. State enterprises have also been allowed to
retain some profits, and investment projects are increasingly being financed
on a loan rather than a grant basis.
3.        In international .rade and investment, China has been progressively
opening up to the rest of the world. Berween 1978 and 1985, the share of
exports to GDP nearly doubled to about 10%, a ratio similar to other large
economies such as the U.S. and Brazil. Foreign investment has been encour-
aged, first through the establishment of four Special Economic Zones and the
signing of joint venture contracts for off-shore oil exploration, and more
recently through the opening of 14 coastal cities to foreign investment.
Growth and Stabilization
4.        Reforms have helped to stimulate more rapid development of the
economy. Real CDP growth averaged 5% p.a. between 1978 and 1981 and 10% p.a.
between 1981 and 1985. More recently, in 1985, growth accelerated to 12.3% as
a result of further reforms emphasizing decentralized decisionmaking, and the
expansionary macroeconomic policies of 1984. During 1978-1985, per capita
incomes in real terms more than doubled in rural areas and increased by more
than 50% in urban areas. Agriculture has continued its remarkably strong
performance, with gross agricultural output value (excluding rural industry
and commerce) rising at nearly 11% p.a. between 1981 and 1985 and grain output
at 8% p.a. (reaching as high as 407 million tons in 1984).  Cash crops and
animal husbandry, stimulated by rising demand and attractive prices, have also
grown rapidly. Gross industrial output value grew at over 10% p.a. over the
same period, with heavy industry growing somewhat faster than light industry
(12% p.a. vs. 9% p.a.). If rural industrial output is included, gross
industrial output value grew at close to 12% p.a. in real terms between 1981



- 2 -
and 1984. The energy constraint on industrial growth was eased by rising coal
output (8% p.a. between 1981 and 1985), renewed increases in crude oil produc-
tion (4% p.a. between 1981 and 1985) and improvements in the efficiency of
energy utilization (primary commercial energy consumption grew only 60h as
fast as GDP between 1981 and 1985). Manufactured exports growth, at 8% p.a.
between 1981 and 1985, was slower than during the 1978-81 period in rhe face
of worsening world market conditions.
5.        The Government continues to face difficulties in combining system
reform and rapid overall growth with maintenance of economic stability.
During 1979 and 1980, China experienced large budget and current account
deficits, combined with excessive investment and inflationary pressures. In
response, a strict stabilization program was introduced in 1981 relying mainly
on administrative controls on investment spending. The program slowed growth
but also helped lower the budget deficit from about 5% of GDP in 1979 to less
than 1% in 1981, reduce inflation to around 2% p.a., and change China's exter-
nal position to one of current account surpluses averaging nearly $4 billion
during 1982-84. As a result, foreign debt and debt service ratios were still
at low levels ($13.1 billion and 6.8%, respectively, in 1984), and China's
foreign currency reserves rose to $17.8 billion (over 9 months' imports) by
mid-1984.
6.        This comfortable balance of payments position disappeared rapidly
during the course of 1984 and early 1985.  Partly as a result of decentraliza-
tion of decisionmaking and the lack of effective indirect policy instruments,
there was a rapid acceleration of investment and consumption during late 1984
and the first half of 1985, causing the economy to overheat. Real GDP grew by
8.8% during 1985, while average wages in state-owned enterprises rose by 20%,
and domestic credit grew by 22%. The retail price index rose by 12% in 1985.
There was also a rapid expansion in consumer goods imports. As a result,
foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $13.2 billion by the end of 1985
(equivalent to 4.2 months of imports), and the current account deficit for the
year was $12 billion, much of which was financed by an increase in foreign
borrowir.g. China's external debt by end 1985 reached $20 billion, up from
$13.1 billion in 1984 and the debt service ratio (including short-term debt)
rose to 8%. The Government responded by launching a strict stabilization
program that aims to control imports and borrowing and includes further
increases in interest rates as well as a series of administrative directives
governing bank credit and project approval. Most recently, in July 1986, the
Renminti was devalued from Y 3.2 to the US dollar to Y 3.7, and a program to
improve controls over external borrowing was introduced. As a result, aggre-
gate credit and investment as well as new import orders have begun to slow.
The balance of payments in 1986 is likely to show an improvement, albeit small
from 1985.
Recent Reforms
7.        The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a major
document on "reform of thte economic structure" in October 1984. According to
that decision, confirmed by the recently approved Seventh Five-Year Plan:
(a) state enterprises should be made fully independent units which pursue
profits and are responsible for losses; (b) the scope of mandatory planning



should be reduced and replaced by indicative planning, while the focus of
planning should shift from annual to mediumr- and long-term guidance planning;
(c) a more rational price system should be introduced, reducing the role of
state-controlled prices and increasing the role of "floating" and free market
prices; and (d) the tax system should be improved, finance and banking should
be reformed, and a larger role should be given to indirect macroeconomic regu-
lation through indirect instruments such as tax, credit and pricing policy.
8.        Rural reforms have continued to progress more rapidly than reforms
*         elsewhere in the economy.  There has been a remarkable spread of nonagricul-
tural activities like processing, transport, and commerce. "Specialized
households" (which concentrate on cash crops, animal husbandry, or nonagri-
cultural activities) and pooling of capital by small groups of households in
various types of ventures are becoming increasingly common forms of economic
organization in China's rural areas. Wholesale markets for some agricultural
products have emerged. To encourage investment in land improvement and devel-
opment, farming contracts between collective and peasant households for the
use of land (which typically had been fixed for no more than 3-5 years) can
now be extended to as long as 15-20 years. In early 1985, the system of
agricultural procurement was changed. Previously the Government purchased
quota output of grain and other crops at relatively low prices and stood ready
to purchase all above-quota output at a higher price. Under the new system,
procurement up to a certain amount (below former quota procurement) is based
on contracts concluded voluntarily between peasants and procurement agen-
cies. Prices for these purchases are based on the relatively high average
price of past years. Output above the contracted amount must be sold by
peasants directly on the free market, but the Government will intervene to
purchase grain if the price falls to the original quota procurement price.
Thus, a considerably larger portion of basic crop production will be produced
for and traded on markets with flexible prices.
9.        The momentum of urban reforms has continued with significant
progress on several fronts. In enterprise management, the focus has been on
broadening and delineating the decisionmaking authority of urban enterprises.
Profit retention now extends to virtually all state-owned industrial enter-
prises and to nonindustrial sectors like transport, commerce, constructioa,
and other services. Urban collectives and individual enterprises, as well as
a variety of joint ventures between them and state enterprises, have grown
rapidly (the number employed in urban individual enterprises rose from 150,000
in 1978 to 3.4 million in 1984).
10.       In financial reforms, the most important new development has been
the implementation of a profit tax system to replace profit remittances by
state enterprises to the government budget. Though most enterprises have
switched to this system, the benefits have been limited because financial
discipline at the enterprise level remains weak. Efforts have been made to
strengthen accounting and auditing systems and more strictly enforce existing
financial regulations, but the expectation remains strong that the Government
will subsidize losses.



4-
11.       Progress has also been made with price reform.  The majority of
agriculture commodity prices were decontrolled even before the recent change
in pricing and procurement of grain. Prices of many consumer goods are also
set by negotiations between producers and commercial units. "Floating prices"
(up to 20% above or below official prices) are now allowed for many industrial
producer goods (either for all output or for output above the mandatory plan
target). Price adjustments for key energy products and raw materials (which
in many cases are severely underpriced) and for subsidized basic consumer
goods like grain and edible oil have proven more difficult to implement,
hindered by the potential impact of price changes on urban living standards
and on the finances of energy-using enterprises. Nevertheless, some price
rises have occurred (e.g., for coal and petroleum), and, moreover, the share
of free-market transactions, at largely uncontrolled prices, has increased in
recent years. Gradually over time, a two-tier system is emerging; a large but
shrinking share of the total supply of most important goods is subject to
mandatory plan allocation and administratively set prices, while at the margin
a substantial and growing share is allocated by the market mechanism, largely
at flexible prices. This pattern may permit China to "grow out of the plan"
in a relatively smooth transition, though there are obvious threats to this
strategy arising from the strong incentive for arbitrage between planned and
unplanned realms.
12.       The Government recognizes the need to develop new tools of indirect
macroeconomic mantagement and has taken some stepe to do so. The People's Bank
of China was established as a separate central bank at the beginning of 1984,
with its commercial banking functions taken on by the newly created Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China. In 1985, new methods of credit planning and
control were introduced and redeposit requirements were introduced for the
specialized banks. Interest rates (including deposit rates) were also raised
in 1985, with some move toward unification of rates and development of a term
structure resembling that in other countries. Technical transformation loans
with a maturity less than one year and loans for working capital now carry the
same 7.9% interest rate while loans of longer maturity carry higher rates, up
to 10.8% for 10-year loans. However, interest rates on budgetary capital
construction loans (formerly grants) remain low, and there is a variety of
directed credit schemes. On the external side, greater use is now being made
of the exchange rate. The old internal settlement rate was abolished at the
beginning of 1985, and between January 1985 and the present, the Renminbi has
been devalued three times, most recently in July, by 16% against the US
dollar. Despite these changes, progress in perfecting new indirect levers of
control has been slow. Recent difficulties in securing macroeconomic balance
highlight the need to strengthen institutions and macroeconomic management
tools (including monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate instruments) for a
decentralized and more market-oriented economy.
Long-Term Issues and Prospects
13.       In April 1986, a national Party conference adopted the new Seventh
Five-Year Plan covering the period 1986-90. The Plan reaffirms the commitment
to economic reform and provides guidelines for future reform and development.
Target growth rates (7% p.a. for industry, 6% for agriculture, 7.5% for GNP)
are below rates of growth achieved with the Sixth Five-Year Plan, investment



is to be restrained in the next few years, and emphasis is to be placed upon
quality rather than quantity of output. It is thought that slower growth will
facilitate reform and help maintain macroeconomic balance.
14.       The Plan identifies three main areas of reform.  First, enterprise
management and incentives are to be improved by: giving enterprises greater
autonomy in production, pricing, and employment decisions; lowering and
equalizing taxes; increasing competition; increasing accountability for
performance; and reforming personnel procedures. In addition, more small
state enterprises will be turned over to collective or individual management
through contracts or leases. Second, the role of the market is to be further
extended, and market networks strengthened. The scope of mandatory planning
will be further reduced, and markets for capital, technology, and labor will
gradually be developed. Third, the emphasis of planning will shift from
detailed administrative control to indirect macroeconomic control through
economic policy. To this end a series of mutually reinforcing reforms in the
planning, pricing, fiscal, banking, and labor and wage systems will be intro-
duced during the plan period.
15.       Specific policy measures will take time to design and implement,
however. Many of the reforms required will be difficult. Since reforms in
different areas are closely interrelated, appropriate sequencing and coordina-
tion are essential. For example, price reform in the absence of improvements
in enterprise financial discipline will have limited benefits, yet the more
profit-oriented behavior that would result from tighter financial discipline
would exacerbate the adverse impact of distorted prices. Similarly, reform of
the labor allocation system will be incomplete without eliminating many of the
"social responsibilities" of enterprises (which now provide housing, medical
care, and pensions for their workers and in many cases education and jobs for
workers' children) and replacing them with Government-supported social service
programs.
16.       China's objective of quadrupling the gross output value of induwcry
and agriculture between 1980 and 2000 (which means GDP growth of well over
6% p.a.) will require significant improvements in efficiency as well as
continued high saving and investment rates. The Plan recognizes there must be
major structural changes in the economy over the next two decades, including a
reduction in the share of agriculture, a rise in the share of industry and
services (which at present is unusually low), and substantial urbanization.
There will also be a shift within agriculture, away from grain and basic crops
and into cash crops and animal husbandry. The new plan will emphasize
development of the service sector, mainly through removing restrictions on
collective and individual activity. Urban development will focus on small and
mediur-sized cities and towns, while restrictions on growth of large urban
areas will continue.
17.       Certain physical/technical constraints will hinder the attempt to
achieve China's targets for the year 2000 and its longer-term goal of catching
up with developed countries. Despite rapid growth and substantial improve-
ments in efficiency in recent years, agriculture may again become a constraint
on overall growth, since land in China is severely limited. In energy, short-
ages of fuel (primarily coal) and electricity may continue to constrain growth



- 6 -
of transport and comnercial infrastructure. Without large new investments and
improved efficiency, economic growth will lag. In mobilizing resources in all
these areas, China could profitably make use of foreign borrowing. Finally,
the rising share of the elderly in China's population (related to the slowdown
in population growth) means that more resources will have to be devoted to
maintaining their consumption levels, especially in the decades after 2000.
18.       Poor motivation and inefficient utilization of labor in the state
sector of the economy are major problems which can be solved only by coordi-
nated reforms in labor allocation, the wage system, enterprise management, and
social services, among other things. Reforms in the system of education and
training to develop China's "human capital" potential also are crucial.  Back-
ward technology and inefficient use of existing technology must be addressed
by a combination of reforms, appropriately directed investment, and transfer
of advanced foreign technology. Irrational location of factories, suboptimal
scale of many plants, and poor utilization of physical capital in general are
related problems.
19.       If reforms successfully transform the economic system, with a bene-
ficial impact on growth and efficiency, a new set of issues will come to the
fore. Management of a reformed economy with indirect fiscal, monetary, and
other instruments is a major issue (see para. 13 above). In this context,
maintaining an adequate saving rate (since the Government no longer accounts
for the bulk of aggregate saving) and avoiding inflation (as well as deep
cyclical downturns) will be major goals. Assuring an adequate minimum
standard of living for the population and an appropriate level of social
services will become a major challenge, as enterprise and rural communal
responsibilities in these areas are reduced. The problem of poor, backward
rural areas in various parts of the country will continue to require atten-
tion. Redistributing financial resources to these areas through the fiscal
system, easing restrictions on migration out of the poorest areas, and lower-
ing nonagricultural wages to make investment in them more attractive are some
options for alleviating poverty.
20.       In order to mobilize the external resources needed for rapid,
sustained growth the Plan calls for export growth of 40-50% over the next five
years to reach $38 billion; greater efforts to attract foreign investment; and
increased but cautious commercial borrowing. Imports are expected to reach
$45 billion by 1990, implying a fairly slow growth rate of 4% per annum but on
a very high base volume of imports in 1984-86. By implication, the Plan calls
for continued borrowing on the world capital markets through the end of the
decade. Under this scenario China's current account deficit would average
around $7-8 billion p.a. during the remainder of this decade, equivalent to
about 2% of GNP. This implies that the present debt service ratio would
increase substantially by 1990, although it would remain below the 15% ceiling
given in the Plan. If China's exports grew more slowly, imports would prob-
ably have to be cut back, because a higher borrowing target although feasible,
might not be comfortable in terms of debt service indicators. This highlights
the need for continued export growth in order to meet other Plan objectives
and to service present and future comercial borrowing. The Plan recognizes
that flexible use of exchange rate and pricing policies will be needed to
encourage export growth.



21.       Even with continued good export performance, China will have
substantial external capital requirements during the remainder of the decade,
and access to concessionary capital will continue to play an important role in
sustaining China's growth.  China is still one of the poorer countries of the
world, but its access to concessionary capital for financing development and
modernization is limited. Apart from Bank Group funds, a significant amount
of concessionary capital is likely to come only from Japan and a few other
bilateral donors and will probably average no more than $500-600 million p.a.
during the rest of the 1980s.
.

II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
22.       To achieve the target growth rates envisioned in the Seventh Five-
Year Plan, to increase efficiency, and to maintain equity in distribution,
China will need continuing economic reforms. China will need to import more
technology, increase trade, and expand investment. In the next few years,
therefore, the Bank can best assist China by increasing its access to foreign
technology and capital and supporting the implementation of reforms that will
help to increase the efficiency of resource use and reduce poverty.
23.       To address China's objective of updating technology, the Bank will
play the role of an intermediary. In transportation, energy, industry, agri-
culture and social sectors, the Bank will contribute to technology transfer by
bringing the Bank's experience to bear on project design and implementation
and by helping China to seek appropriate technical solutions through interna-
tional competitive bidding, training, and foreign technical assistance.
24.       Bank assistance will be closely linked with the Government's reform
efforts. There are five major elements common to both rural and urban reform
in China that will be the focus of the Bank's involvement. First, institu-
tional change, involving both the separation of economic and administrative
functions and further decentralization of decisiornmaking, will extend to every
sector in which the Bank is involved. Second, financial sector reform,
primarily development of financial institutions, has become a focus of Bank
assistance. Third, improving planning and project analysis will be critical
to reform in sectors such as agriculture and industry, where decisions are now
being made by households and independent enterprises, as well as in infra-
structure where direct government involvement will be required. The Bank will
therefore continue its emphasis on introducing appraisal methods and financial
planning as well as analysis of intersectoral issues. Fourth, the Bank will
be involved in the Government's major program of price reform and development
of indirect levers such as control via money, credit and fiscal policies. And
finally, the Bank will support reforms in health, education and other social
services and measures, in particular, to address the problems of poor regions.
Economic and Sector Work
25.       The Bank's economic and sector work in China aims at expanding the
understanding of the structure and direction of the Chinese economy and of the
tools of economic management. This work provides a foundation for Bank Group
lending and for the dialogue with the Government on development options and
policies. The Bank's program of economic and sector work in China is in four
main areas. The first consists of studies aimed at providing timely advice on
the macrosystemic elements cf economic reform. Past work has included two
major economic reports, and a third will be produced this year based on the
findings of an FY86 mission which studied the evolving processes of mobiliza-
tion, intermediation and allocation of investment resources in China. A study
on reform of China's foreign trade and investment regimes will be undertaken
in FY87.



26.       A second area of the program is concerned with macroeconomic manage-
ment.  Working in close cooperation with the IMF, the Bank will assist China
in examining medium-term macroeconomic prospects, with particular attention to
fiscal, balance of payments and external debt trends and related policy
issues. The Bank will also continue to organize seminars on macroeconomic
issues.
27.       The third area is sector analysis to provide support to the reform
process at the sectoral and micro levels, to strengthen sector planning and to
underpin the development of the Bank's lending program. Emphasis will be
given to sector work in industry, energy and transport, reflecting priorities
identified for the Seventh Five-Year Plan.
28.       The fourth area of economic and sector work is continued collabora-
tive economic study with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other
Chinese research institutions. This type of collaboration has proven to be an
effective means of introducing Chinese academics and technicians to modern
research concepts and techniques. A study of state enterprise management has
been completed, and work is now underway on a similar study of township and
village collective enterprises, which are expected to become increasingly
important industrial organizations in the reformed system.
Lending Operations
29.       Since China's change of representation in the Bank Group in May 1980,
41 projects involving lending of $4,086.1 million to China have been approved.
Of the projects, twelve have been in the agriculture sector, ten in energy,
six in transport, four in industry, four in education, two each in health and
technical cooperation and one in water supply. In FY85, IFC made its first
investment in China of $17.02 million in automobile manufacturing.
30.       In addition to the proposed Red Soils Area Development Project, we
expect to present to the Board this year projects in hydroelectric power, port
development, machine tools, industrial credit, area development, coal, urban
sanitation and highway development. For FY87 and beyond, we expect the
lending program for China to continue to grow from current levels. Infra-
structure projects in energy and transport will remain priorities. Technical
renovation of enterprises, particularly in industry, will be given greater
attention and support as will the regional approach to project devnlopment,
which is the basis of a proposed project to meet the needs of Gansu province.
31.       In the energy sector, future Bank lending will be aimed at improving
efficiency of energy consumption and expanding energy production. For
example, in the coal subsector, we will assist in upgrading the facilities and
operations of existing mines and in transferring improved technology for mines
under construction or in operation. In power, we will assist China in tech-
nology transfer, system planning, staff training and institution building. In
the petroleum subsector, the rationale for project involvement will lie in the
identification, packaging and transfer of specialized technologies as well as
in the strengthening of investment planning and management capabilities.



- 10 -
32.       Future transport projects will be aimed at contributing to China's
efforts to efficiently meet the transport requirements of its growing
economy. In roads, major changes in organization and financing will be
required as a result of administrative decentralization and introduction of
the production responsibility system in rural areas. In railways, we will
focus on technologies to improve domestic production of railway equipment and
materials in addition to our work on line construction and electrification.
We also intend to broaden our involvement in ports to include coastal shipping
and inland water transport. For all transport subsectors, we will support
efforts to improve financial analysis and investment planning.
33.       Bank lending in industry will continue to support financial interme-
diaries which provide credit to state and collective enterprises. In
addition, we will expand lending in the sector through direct and subsector
lending to upgrade technology, conserve energy, and improve overall organiza-
tion and management, particularly in fertilizer, cement, machine tools and
other capital goods industries.
34.       Agriculture lending will focus on developing institutions to provide
services to individual farmers and to monitor and stimulate change in the pace
and pattern of agricultural development. The shift from grant to loan finance
and the increased autonomy of the rural banking system will continue to be
supported through rural credit projects. We will also assist with the train-
ing, research, extension, and other service activities of the ministries
concerned with agriculture. In addition, we expect to finance programs for
specialized agricultural development such as livestock and for irrigation and
area development.
35.       Bank lending in education will suppport China's efforts to expand
and improve the quality of higher education, develop technical and vocational
education and strengthen basic education by improving training of teachers and
administrators, increasing domestic capacity to produce teaching materials and
educational equipment, and raising the quality of schools administration at
the provincial level.
36.       Project preparation in the urban sector is currently concentrated in
Shanghai on efforts to improve services, especially in environmental upgrading
and housing, and development of muaicipal institutions. Future lending is
expected to include support for development of mediur-size and small urban
areas in specific provinces.  In addition, we expect to continue lending for
rural water supply.  Bank lending in health will provide access to new medical
technologies for more efficient health care in both the lingering problems of
communicable disease, particularly in poor rural areas, and the emerging
problems of chronic disease. This will involve further support for medical
training and planning and management of service delivery systems. Projects
will also support the reform of systems for supplying and financing health
services.
37.       Cofinancing with multilateral and bilateral agencies has been
arranged for projects in coal, power, transport, agriculture and rural water
supply and will remain a feature of our assistance program. We will explore
further options for cofinancing with export credit agencies. Commercial bank



- 11 -
cofinancing and the use of B-loans also appear viable, particularly as China
increases the overall volume of its foreign borrowing. In technical assist-
ance, we will continue to incorporate into projects components for training,
overseas study, and access to foreign expertise. In addition, we will be the
executing agency for a second UNDP umbrella project in China. EDI activities
remain an important element of the Bank's program and in coming years will
provide an extensive program of policy seminars for senior Chinese officials,
and economic and financial management courses and sector-specific training for
officials from core and line agencies.
Implementation
38.       Project implementation is generally proceeding well- Most project
agencies, as well as the Ministry of Finance and the State Plina±ng Commission,
have established and staffed offices to handle Bank projects. Disbursement
performance has also been satisfactory. Special accounts have been estab-
lished for a majority of the approved projects and have helped to speed
disbursements. In October 1985, the Bank opened a resident office in Beijing
to support further expansion of the lending program, accelerate project prepa-
ration, improve project implementation and further economic and sector work.
