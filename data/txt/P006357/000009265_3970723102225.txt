BRAZIL
SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS).
Guarantor:      Federative Republic of Brazil.
Beneficiaries:  ELETROPAULO - Eletricidade de Sao Paulo S.A. (ELETROPAULO)
LIGHT Servicos de Eletricidade S.A.(LIGHT)
Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL)
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS).
Amount:         US$312 million equivalent.
Terms:          Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
Relending
Terms:        ELETROBRAS will relend US$310 million of the proceeds of
the loan to the Beneficiaries on the same terms and
conditions of the loan. Interest and foreign exchange
risks will be borne by the Beneficiaries. The balance will
be used by ELETROBRAS to finance studies for the
preparation of electric energy conservation programs and
studies for power distribution planning.
Project
Description:  The proposed project would support Government efforts  to
reverse the financial deterioration of the sector. It is a
priority project within the Government's 1984-1988 Sector
Development Plan which the Bank has analyzed and approved.
The objectives of the project are to support the expansion
of power distribution systems in highly industrialized
areas, to improve the operation and planning of the
Beneficiaries' distribution systems, and to support energy
conservation programs. The proposed project consists of
portions of the investment programs for 1986-89 of the
three Beneficiaries, and studies and overseas training for
distribution planning and for the preparation of electric
energy conservation programs.
Benefits and    The proposed project would allow the Beneficiaries to
Risks:        distribute the energy from large generation plants nearing
completion to the most populated and industrialized area in
the country; to meet projected demand; to restore or
maintain the reliability of service to key consumer groups,
and to start with the preparation of electric energy

conservation programs. The project itself does not present
any special risks. The main risk derives from the
financial difficulties currently faced by the Brazilian
power sector. They are being addressed through a number of
measures to be agreed between the Government and the Bank
that would progressively improve the financial conditions
of the sector.

1. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
Energy Sector
- Energy Resources
1.01      Brazil's energy resources comprise a vast hydropotential, as well
as oil shale, coal, nuclear fLels and biomass.  Proven oil and gas reserves
are limited. Of the indigenous energy resources only hydro and biomass
currently play a significant role in the country's energy supply mix,
though domestic oil production has increased significantly in the last
three years and in 1983 it covered only about 35% of the market
requirements. The potential for hydroelectric development is estimated at
about 213,000 MW of which about 50,000 KW are in use or under construction.
1.02      Presently the Government is making important efforts to increase
domestic oil production and substitute domestic alcohol, natural gas, coal
and other sources of energy for oil. Started in 1975, production nf
alcohol for use as fuel in internal combustion engines amounted in 1984 to
9 billion liters equivalent to 120,000 bbls. of oil per day. The current
goal is to produce by 1993 about 20 billion liters of alcohol equivalent to
256,000 bbls. of oil per day. In 1983 coal production was 5.2 million
tons, equivalent to 29,000 bbls. of oil per day or about 4% of the energy
supply. The government expects that in 1993 coal production will be 21.8
million tons, equivalent to 104,000 bbls. of oil per day, about 8% of the
total energy supply. Brazil is also developing a nuclear generating
capacity which should have an important role in electricity generation
beyond the year 2010, when most of the economically exploitable hydro
resources would be utilized. Efforts are also being made for a more
intensive utilization of other domestic energy resources, including burning
wood and sugarcane bagasse for electricity generation in isolated areas.
- Energy Demand and Supply
1.03      In 1983, Brazil's gross energy consumption was 152 million tons
of oil equivalent (t.o.e), or 1.2 t.o.e. per head of population and is
expected to grow at about 5.8% p.a. through 1986, reaching about 1.33
t.o.e. per capita in 1986. Oil products, about 61% of them imported,
accounted for 35% of energy consumption and hydroelectricity for 29%; the
remaining 36% was met mainly by coal, wood products and bagasse.
- National Energy Policy
1.04      National energy policy has the following main objectives:
(a) Conservation and rational use of energy to encourage maximum
efficiency in the utilization of energy resources;
(b) substitution of imported energy sources by domestic ones,
especially -renewables-, wherever technically and economically
feasible, to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and coal;
and
(c) exploitation of existing domestic energy resources and
intensification of search for new sources.



- 2 -
While (b) and (c) are desirable objectives, it is important for Brazil to
scrutinize further development of domestic energy sources carefully. Given
the country's domestic and external resource constraints and the prospects of
relatively stable real oil prices in the next decade, only cost-effective
substitutes which require relatively modest investments should be
undertaken. Controlling energy consumption is also important. The
Government could be using pricing more aggressively to promote conservation.
While the domestic prices of gasoline and diesel are substantially higher
than the international prices; LPG, fuel oil, and naphtha prices do not cover
c.i.f. international prices plus local distribution costs. Incentives for
alcohol use are still substantial; the retail alcohol price is 35% lower than
the gasoline price, although the energy differential between the two is
closer to 20-25%. And, as discussed later on in this report, electric power
rates are substantially below the long-run marginal cost of production.
Finally, as long as the Government continues to regulate the energy sector,
more coordination in the development and use of the major fuels is needed, in
order to reduce overexpansion of capacity. The issues related to power are
being dealt with through this and other Bank loans given to the sector, while
loans for alcohol and transportation address issues related to alcohol and
other fuels.
Power Sector
- Policies
1.05      The power sector is making an important contribution in achieving
the national energy policy goals listed above. Pricing of electricity will
be very important in encouraging conservation and promoting efficient
resource allocation. In this respect, progress has been made through marginal
cost tariff studies carried out under loans 1300-BR, 1824-BR and 1939-BR. The
results of these studies will be put into effect over several years in the
framework of currently enacted legislation and should result in more
efficient use of installed capacity (para. 5.12(b)). Plans for generating
plants to be built in the remainder of this century give emphasis to the use
of indigenous primary energy resources (hydropower, coal and uranium). As
96% of electricity generated in the existing interconnected systems is
hydro; there is little room for displacing oil in power generation. However,
to make full use of the existing hydro generation capacity, gradual
substitution of electricity for oil products in industry is being encouraged
through application of low rates for interruptible and off-peak electricity
services.
-  Organization
1.06      The institutional development of the Brazilian power sector over
the last 50 years has been characterized by progressive nationalization and
growing centralization, resulting in the consolidation of a few large and
hundreds of small utilities into a relatively compact structure of state and
federally-owned utilities. The power sector is under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) created in 1960. Since then the drive has
been towards increasing sector efficiency and coordination with the



establishment of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS) (paras.
2.02 to 2.11) in 1962, and the strengthening of the Departamento Nacional de
Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE), within MME, as regulatory agency. The aim
has been to combine, as much as possible, regionalization of operations with
country-wide optimization of resources.
1.07      Though complex, and one of the largest in the world, the
electric-power sector is well organized and past policies have generally been
well formulated and applied. Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967 established the
current sector organization under which DNAEE performs regulatory functions,
grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, approves
expansion plans and sets tariffs, after approval by the Ministry of Planning,
based upon the Water Code of 1934, as amended, under the principle of
service-at-cost plus an adequate return on capital (Annex 1.1). ELETROBRAS
serves as a holding company and as a sector development bank (para. 2.06).
ELETROBRAS also analyzes expansion plans for major generating and
transmission facilities and coordinates and supervises the public power
system.
1.08      Four ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries (FURNAS, CHESF, ELETROSUL
and ELETRONORTE) are responsible primarily for regional generation and
high-voltage transmission systems. They act as bulk suppliers to state and
municipal utility companies which generally are responsible for
sub-transmission and electricity distribution. In addition to the four
regional subsidiaries, ELETROBRAS also owns ESCELSA (Espirito Santo Centrais
Eletricas), the power distributor for the State of Espirito Santo in the
Southeast, and LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade S.A., servicing the
metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro. ELETROBRAS also holds the Brazilian
Government's 50% interest in the Itaipu Binacional, the binational agency set
up in April 1973 by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay to build jointly
the 12,600 MW Itaipu hydroelectric facility on the Parana river.
1.09      Since 1967 the Government policy has been to consolidate public
electricity service in the individual states into single state-owned
utilities primarily responsible for distribution activities, although some of
them have also generation and transmission activities. This policy has
resulted in the absorption by the major state-owned companies of many
municipal and privately owned utilities and in the gradual transfer to the
state-owned utilities of ELETROBRAS' ownership in distribution utilities.
The main existing state-owned utilities are: CESP-Companhia Energetica de
Sao Paulo (CESP); ELETROPAULO-Eletricidade de Sao Paulo S.A. (ELETROPAULO);
Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Companhia Paranaense de Energia
(COPEL); Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE) - Rio Grande do Sul;
Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL); Centrais Eletricas de Santa
Catarina S.A. (CELESC); Companhia de Eletricidade do Estado da Bahia
(COELBA); Companhia de Eletricidade de Pernambuco (CELPE), and Companhia de
Eletricidade do Ceara (COELCE). All these utilities have been borrowers or
beneficiaries under past Bank loans. Despite this process of consolidation,
the sector still comprises 600 concessionaires, of which 25 are state
companies and the rest small municipal and private companies.



-4-
- Growth of Demand
1.10      In 1983, national average production of electricity was about 1,000
kWh per capita; the industrial sector used 512 of the electricity and the
residential sector 22%. Due to the high industrial and urban concentration
in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the geographical distribution
of demand is uneven. Though the most developed states have promoted rural
electrification, access to electricity in rural areas for the whole country
is still low (about 20Z). During the period of 1970 to 1980 public service
electricity consumption rose at an average annual growth rate of 13Z, which
is very high when compared with other countries. Though the annual increase
rates in the last three years have been lower than the previous decade's, (3Z
in 1981; 6Z in 1982; and 8% in 1983) they are still high when compared with
other countries. The revised projections of electricity consumption recently
prepared by ELETROBRAS show that despite the difficult economic situation
faced by the country demand was expected to grow 11% p.a. in 1984 and at a
moderate rate of about 8% p.a. in the period 1985-1998 which would imply a
certain degree of energy management through pricing.  The Government's
intention now is to increase tariffs over time to reflect long-run marginal
cost. During negotiations the Government agreed to prepare, and agree with
the Bank, during 1985 on a plan of action to implement by December 1989 the
recommendations of a long-run marginal cost study financed by the Bank (Loan
1939-BR) (para. 5.12 (b)).
- System Expansion Planning
1--11     ELETROBRAS has the primary responsibility for the coordination of
planning in the power sector and for the preparation of system generation and
transmission expansion plans. Distribution planning is the responsibility of
each individual utility company but a higher degree of participation of
ELETROBRAS in the global assessment of the adequacy of the level of
investments of the individual utilities is needed, to ensure a consistent
approach. At negotiations, agreement was reached with ELETROBRAS to
implement by December 31, 1987, a medium term program satisfactory to the
Bank, designed to strengthen ELETROBRAS' role in the sector distribution
planning.
1.12      ELETROBRAS is subject to the supervision of DNAEE in the
preparation of its plans, and the plans themselves are subject to the formal
approval of MME. However, in practice, DNAEE tends to concentrate on tariff
planning and on the sector budgeting exercise, which provides financial
projections for the ensuing three years. Since 1981 the responsibility for
approving the investment programs and tariff levels of public utilities has
been exercised by the Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN). The composition of
Brazil's current generation expansion program for the 1980's was based, by
and large, on ELETROBRAS' demand forecasts prepared in the 1970s which are
now seen to have been too optimistic and to have assumed an availability of
financial resources which failed to materialize fully. This program resulted



in commitments for large generating plants (Itaipu, Tucurui and nuclear)
which are now nearing completion but which leave a significant financial
burden to the sector.
1.13      ELETROBRAS has developed a set of mathematical planning models and
programs specially suited to the size and complexity of the Brazilian power
sector for preparing a comprehensive Master Development Plan every three or
four years. The latest generation and transmission development plan to meet
demand through the year 2000 (Plano 2000) was prepared in 1982. Plano 2000
is the result of a comprehensive planning process which includes evaluation
of energy resources and inter and intra sectoral coordination. The country's
major energy problem, its heavy dependence on oil imports, is reflected in
sector planning: Plano 2000 taps only indigenous resources - hydro, uranium
and coal - for expanding the generation system. A complete revision of Plano
2000 is scheduled for 1986; however, partial revisions are made annually to
adjust the expansion program to take into account: changes in demand, peak
reduction through application of time-of-day tariffs, the effect of energy
substitution program, the progress of projects under construction, and
financial considerations. As a result of these revisions, a -*edium-term plan
was prepared in 1984 and is described below.
- The Sector Development Plan
1.14      On the basis of the methodology of tie Piano 2000 and in order to
address more effectively the urgent finan^ial needs of the sector in the
medium term ELETROBRAS with support from the federal and state utilities, in
consultation with SEPLAN, and with input from the Bank, prepared in 1984 a
general Power Sector Development Plan for the 1984 to 1988 period. This
plan serves as a basis for the operations with Bank involvement p-esently
under consideration. For the preparation of the revised Development Plan, it
was agreed that:
Ci) the demand scenario would be based upon moderate targets on
expanding electricity coverage to the population, realistic
assumptions in relation to the possibility of implementing large
industrial projects, and modest increases in electricity
consumption due to energy substitution;
(ii) the expansion plan would consider the minimum investments required
to provide electricity to the final user with levels of reliability
which, even though lower than the reliability levels traditionally
used in the sector for planning purposes, are still considered
acceptable;
(iii) investments in generation would be directed toward completing
ongoing construction and starting additional works to provide
energy needed after 1990;



- 6 -
(iv) investments in transmission would be directed toward completing
transmission networks required for transfering the energy
generated by projects nearing completion and constructing high
priority lines;
(v) invect-ments in distribution would include increases in the
level of investment over those in the last few years which are
considered lo-w in relation to the needs. However, the sector
plan would not provide for major rehabilitation of some
distribution systems which have reduced their reliability because
of insufficient investment in the past few years; and
(vi) the Government would take or allow to be taken measures to
strengthen the financial condition of the sector so that it may
be in a position to carry out the investment program (paras.
5.08-5.12).
1.15      Sector investment needs in the period 1984-1988 would be about
US$4.5 billion per year. This level of investment is low considering that it
is equal in nominal terms to the average sector investment realized in the
period 1979-1983, when the demand was considerably lower. However, this is
reasonable because of the heavy investment in generation made in the past and
the current lack of resources.
1.16      The proposed project has been identified as priority investment in
this revised Development Plan; it is essential for transfering the energy
generated by projects nearing completion to the major load centers. Bank
financing for this project would support the financial rebabilitation of the
power sector by monitoring through annual reviews the sectoral investment
program and the measures that would be taken by the Government for this
purpose (para. 5.12(a)).
- Sector Finances
1.17      The sector finances are discussed in detail in Chapter 5, and the
main problems and proposed actions on the subject are summarized here.
Sector finances deteriorated in the late 1970's and early 1980's and the
sector faces now a critical financial situation with a heavy debt service,
inadequate consumer based funds generation, and constraints in Goverment
contributions. The Government, with Bank assistance, has prepared a
financial rehabilitation program which is based on a program of real tariff
increases to achieve a rate of remuneration of 10% by 1989, a power sector
development plan which considers the minimum investment required to meet
demand projected at moderate rates (para. 1.14), improvements in the debt
profiles, and compensation to the sector of any increase of its operating
costs resulting from the operation of and the Itaipu hydroelectric station.
The above problems and actions, related to the financial rehabilitation of



the sector, are being addressed through the proposed loan and the loan for
the proposed CHESF-FURNAS Transmission Project currently under preparation
(see Chapter 7).
- Financial Information and Financial Planning System
1.18      The procedures used to consolidate the financial information for
the sector as a whole are not adequate. While the ELETROBRAS Group issues
yearly consolidated financial statements for its subsidiaries, the sector's
historic financial information originates from different sources (several
departments of ELETROBRAS or DKAEE). This financial information is prepared
under different criteria; the final versions of each statement are completed
at different times, and the coverage is not always comprehensive of all the
utilities in the sector. The present procedures need substantial improvement
to allow a better analysis of sector finances.
1.19      Similarly, the financial planning system of the Brazilian power
sector has not yet been able to consolidate in a timely fashion the financial
projections of the utilities to arrive at sector aggregates. Thus
projections used for sector analysis do not contain details of each utility's
finances and are prepared using a computer model which is not compatible with
the computer models used for financial projections by the individual
utilities. The planning process goes from top to bottom as the sector
projections give the general conditions on which the individual projections
will be based. The process is slow as several months are needed to obtain
projections of individual utilities, consistent with the sector projections.
In the case of Brazil such slowness is critical as conditions change rapidly
and frequently, especially because of high inflation. Thus the sector's
financial planning system should be improved to allow more reliable and
timely analyses of financial forecasts.
1.20      During negotiations agreement was reached with ELETROBRAS to carry
out a study to consolidate, in a timely and consistent fashion, the
historical financial information and financial planning systems for the power
sector, within the general framework of Government regulations and avoiding
duplication of systems. This study should be completed by December 31, 1986
and its conclusions implemented starting in January 1987. The study would be
basically carried out by sector specialists (see Annex 1.3).
- Bank Participation
1.21      Since 1949, the Bank's loans to the Brazilian power sector have
amounted to about US$2.4 billion. Most of the loans have been for
hydroelectric plants and associated transmission facilities in the
Southeastern and Southern regions, but the most recent loans have been mainly
for transmission and distribution projects, and included beneficiaries
outside these two regions. The Bank's lending strategy in the sector has
been, besides financing high priority projects, to promote rational tariff
policies, monitor sector finances and keep continuous dialogue on measures



-8-
required for their progressive improvement, act as catalyst for the
mobilization of funding from other agencies, and help strengthen sector
coordination and planning. Given the country and the sector's present
financial crisis, the Bank's role ia the future would be to assist the
Government and sector authorities in their efforts to improve the financial
condition of the sector through realistic investment and financial policies.
The Bank began to assist the Government's efforts to improve the financial
situation of the sector with the tariff agreement of September 1981,
supplemented with the rate of remuneration agreement of November 1983
(para. 5.08). Since then, sector authorities and the Bank collaborated in
preparing the 1984-88 sector Development Plan which will be the general
framework for future Bank sector operations. Because the sector's present
financial constraints are so stringent the Bank would further assist the
sector by financing interest during construction of this project. Nine
project performance audit reports1? have been distributed to the Executive
Directors. These reports conclude that, despite construction delays, cost
overruns in some cases, and the beginning of a deteriorating financial trend
in the late 1970s Bank financing had been substantially successful. In
general, such reports emphasized the useful role played by the Bank in the
Brazilian Power Sector.

2. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
- Introduction
2.01      The borrower would be ELETROBRAS which would onlend the proceeds
of the proposed loan, under the same terms and conditions, to the
beneficiaries (ELETROPAULO, LIGHT and CPFL) for their proposed distribution
expansion subprojects, and would use a portion of the loan for studies for
distribution planning and conservation under the proposed project (see
para. 4.01) the beneficiaries would bear the interest and foreign exchange
risks of the loan. As borrower, ELETROBRAS would sign on-lending
agreements satisfactory to the Bank with each one of the beneficiaries.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with ELETROBRAS that as a
condition of loan effectiveness at least one satisfactory on-lending
agreement would have been signed, and as a condition of disbursement for
the other beneficiaries each one of the corresponding on-lending agreements
would have been signed. The on-lending agreenents should contain the
standard loan covenants included under Bank loans for the power sector in
Brazil, e.g. reporting requirements, access to works and information,
commitments of counterpart funding, accounting records, independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and indebtedness limits. The three
beneficiaries have been Bank borrowers/beneficiaries under previous
operations, they are efficiently run companies and ELETROBRAS is not
expected to play a direct role in the execution of their respective
subprojects. Supervision will be performed directly by Bank staff.
The Borrower (ELETROBRAS)
- Background
2.02      ELETROBRAS was created in 1962 by Law No. 3890-A as a vehicle for
consolidating existing public utilities, centralizing management of the
sector and encouraging orderly regional expansion and long-term growth.
ELETROBRAS is a mixed economy corporation (sociedade de economia mista),
operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME)
and responsible for the planning, financing, coordination and supervision
of the operation and expansion of the Brazilian power sector (paras. 1.06
to 1.09 and 1.11 to 1.13).
2.03      Under law, at least 51 percent of the company's voting stock must
always be owned directly or indirectly by the Brazilian Government, which
currently holds 99.8 percent of total company shares and 100 percent of
voting stock. In accordance with its objectives established by law,
ELETROBRAS shall apply the resources allccated to it for the development of
the electric energy sector of Brazil, coordinate the activity of and render
financial, technical and administrative assistance to its subsidiary and
associated companies, and implement the national electric energy policy
under the guidelines issued by MME.



- 10 -
- Organization and Management
2.04      ELETROBRAS is governed by an Administrative Board of Directors
comprised of the President (appointed by the President of the Republic of
Brazil); five Directors who are elected at the General Shareholders meeting
for a term of three years and who head up the various departments of the
company (Coordination, Operations and Systems, Economics and Finance,
Planning and Engineering, and Corporate Management); four Counselors, elected
for a term of three years, who are associated with public power companies
under federal concession and have experience in technology, finance or
business management; and two Counselors, again elected for a term of three
years, one representing public bodies other than the Federal Government and
another representing private shareholders. An Executive Board, comprised of
the President and the five Directors, has responsibility of making policy
recommendations to the Board and managing the day-to-day activities of the
company. Annex 2.1.1 shows the organizational structure of ELETROBRAS, which
is adequate to serve the company's needs.
- Financing Role
2.05      Because of its function as holding company, financial agency and
development bank for the Brazilian power sector, ELETROBRAS plays a pivotal
role in the development of the sector. It finances projects of subsidiary
and associated companies.  ELETROBRAS, thus becomes heavily dependent on
sector based resources for its finances. This tends to make ELETROBRAS'
financial conditions mirror the trends in the finances of the sector.
2.06      ELETROBRAS raises funds from four sources, as follows:
(a) Statutory Resources: ELETROBRAS receives and distributes funds
from two statutory sources, the Compulsory Loan and the Global
Reversion Fund (GRF)(Annex 1.1).
(b)  Government Funds.   There are two sources of funding from the
Federal Government, its reinvestment of ELETROBRAS' dividends and
special appropriations.
(c) Internally Generated Funds. Internal sources of funds include
dividends paid on its investments by its subsidiaries and
associated companies and payments of interest and principal from
loans advanced to those companies. In lending from its general
resources, ELETROBRAS requires borrowers to guarantee their loans
with their statutory sole tax quotas (Imposto Unico de Energia
Eletrica - IUEE)(Annex 1.1).
(d) Borrowings. ELETROBRAS raises both domestic and foreign currency
loans. Proceeds from these loans are relent or invested in
subsidiaries or associated companies. Annual borrowings targets
for ELETROBRAS are established on a yearly basis and in accordance
with the sector budget approved by SEST.



- 11 -
2.07      Decreasing consumer-based contributions in face of a relatively
heavy investment program, caused ELETROBRAS to increasingly rely on
borrowings (from 4% of total sources in 1973 to aii estimated average of 25%
in 1982/84), thus increasing the debt service burden and thereby additionally
eroding its internally generated funds (paras. 5.05 to 5.07). Sector
financial projections forecast a reversal of such deteriorating trend
(paras.5.08 to 5.11). This reversal and a subsequent progressive
improvement is based upon the November 1983 agreement on tariffs and target
rates of remuneration and the implementation of a financial rehabilitation
program for the sector (para.5.12) co be submitted by the Government and
ELETROBRAS as a condition of effectiveness.
- Planning and Budgeting
2.08      ELETROBRAS has long been at the center of sector technical and
financial planning, both in the short-term through the budgeting process and
in the long-term associated planning. Since 1981, however,
ELETROBRAS'responsibility for the budgetary process has been reduced with the
centralizing of decision-making in SEST (an agency of the Secretariat of
Planning). Besides budgeting and related financial planning ELETROBRAS has
primary responsibility for the coordination of medium and long-term planning
in the power sector and preparation of system expansion plans (para. 1.11).
Planning functions are carried out satisfactorily.
- Training and Staff Relations
2.09      ELETROBRAS' staff is competent and well trained.  At the present
time some difficulties in recruiting and maintaining staff exist because, in
order to fight inflation, ceilings for salaries of top management of
government-run entities have been established and salary increases have not
kept up with inflation. The Federal Government has established a zero-growth
rate in the number of personnel of ELETROBRAS. With these constraints in
salary levels and number of personnel, ELETROBRAS will be obliged to improve
the productivity of its staff.
2.10      ELETROBRAS has a comprehensive and updated training program,
for personnel of Brazilian power utilities conducted by capable staff, that
also benefits its own staff members. This training program has been extended
to other South American power companies, members of the Regional Electric
Commission (CIER).
- Accounting and Auditing
2.11      The accounting system of ELETROBRAS is satisfactory and well suited
to ELETROBRAS' needs. Internal control functions are vested in the Internal
Auditing Department which reports to the President. Internal Audit carries
an adequate program of financial audits and follow-up on past recommend-
ations. ELETROBRAS employs as its external auditors the firm Boucinhas,
Campos and Claro Ltda. which is acceptable to the Bank. In addition, the
Fiscal Council, appointed by the Shareholders' meeting, carries out external
control duties in accordance with Brazilian legislation.

- Prior Bank Lending
2.12      The proposed operation would be the seventh loan to ELETROBRAS.2/
Except for its participation as one of the executing agencies of the Electric
Power System Coordination Project (SINSC) under Loan 1939-BR and small
components of studies and training under Loans 1300-BR, 1939-BR and 2365-BR,
ELETROBRAS has acted basically as a financing agency to channel the resources
to the executing agencies, beneficiaries of the loans. No PPAR on these
loans has yet been issued. ELETEOBRAS' performance has been satisfactory in
all operations. In two of them (2138-BR and 2364-BR), ELETROBRAS' role was
expanded as the Bank delegated its functions of appraisal and supervision of
the beneficiaries. It is still too early to make an assessment of
ELETROBRAS' performance under this system.
The Beneficiaries (ELETROPAULO, LIGHT and CPFL)
2.12      ELETROBRAS would on-lend about US$179 million to ELETROPAULO, US$71
million to LIGHT and US$60 million to CPFL.
- Background and Ownership
2.13      ELETROPAULO was created on March 20, 1981 to operate the
generation, transmission and distribution sub-system in Sao Paulo which was
bought from LIGHT on March 31, 1981. It is the largest distribution company
in Brazil. The State Government through Departamento de Aguas e Energia
Eletrica do Estado de Sao Paulo (DAEE) is the owner of 99.7% of common stock
and thus controls the company. LIGHT is the owner of 96.6% of the company's
preferred stock.
2.14      Canadian investors founded "The Sao Paulo Tramway, Light and Power
Company" in 1899 and "The Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company' in
1905 to operate public utilities in the Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro areas,
respectively. In 1912, these two companies and several other Canadian-owned
public utilities were merged under the -Brazilian Traction, Light and Power
Company Ltd." which later acquired additional public utilities and expanded
its role to cover the areas of electricity, gas, water supply, tramways and
telephone. In the 1960's the company concentrated its efforts in the
electricity sector while leaving other public utility sectors. In 1967, the
Sao Paulo Light S.A. absorbed all power companies of the group and the
resulting company was named LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. On January
12, 1979 BRASCAN sold 85% of its controlling stock in LIGHT to ELETROBRAS and
in 1981 LIGHT sold the Sao Paulo subsystem to ELETROPAULO. LIGHT is a
corporation and its shareholders composition is as follows: ELETROBRAS,
82.2%; Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimiento Economico e Social (BNDES), 8.0%;
and other, 9.8%.
2.15      CPFL was created on November 16, 1912 by a group of Sao Paulo
entrepreneurs for the industrial production of electricity, promotion of
2/ 1300-BR (05/76); 1538-BR (05/78); 1939-BR (01/82); 2138-BR (05/82);
2364-BR (12/83); 2365-BR (12/83); CHESF-FURNAS Power Transmission.

electricity consumption and sale of electric equipment. In 1927 the company
was bought by the American Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) a subsidiary of
Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO), an American utility holding
company. CPFL is now a corporation and its common stock composition is as
follows: Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP), 73.3%; ELETROBRAS, 13.4%;
and municipalities and other, 14.3%.
- Organization
2.16      The organization of the beneficiaries is well structured and
follows the general pattern of Brazilian power sector utilities (see Annexes
2.1.2,   2.1.3 and 2.1.4).  The Shareholders Assembly nominates the members
of the Administrative and Fiscal Cotncils, approves the company's financial
statements and the distribution of profits. The Administrative Council sets
general policy directives for the company, elects among its members the
President of the company, appoints the Executive Directors, approves the
corporate budget and engages the services of independent auditors.
2.17      The President and the Executive Directors3/ constitute the Board
of Directors which has executive functions and is responsible for managing
the day-to-day activities of the company (ELETROPAULO and CPFL, also have
Executive Vicepresidents).  The Executive Directors head each one of the
utilities departments (six in ELETROPAULO, five in LIGHT and four in CPFL).
Staff units assist the President (or the Vice-President) in carrying out his
statutory functions.
- Management Systems
2.18      Notwithstanding that the three beneficiaries are well-run utilities
they have been incorporated in an institution building scheme which was
started under loans 2138-BR and 2364-BR. ELETROBRAS prepares institutional
assessments of the utilities pointing out the areas where improvements
are advisable and, after agreement with the utilities, the corresponding
recommendations become action plans which are implemented during project
execution. Individual specialists for each management system, from companies
where the corresponding systems are working adequately, are engaged by
ELETROBRAS to make the assessment and monitor the implementation process.
The scheme has been quite successful as it has promoted an intra-sector
transfer of technology with significant results.
2.19      The institutional assessments of ELETROPAULO and LIGHT were
performed under loan 2364-BR, of which they are beneficiaries. The
corresponding plans of action are under implementation and are being closely
monitored. The assessment of CPFL was completed by ELETROBRAS during the
Bank's appraisal mission. The assessments have been found satisfactory by
the Bank and no major institutional deficiencies have been id_ntified which
would require a special agreement under the proposed loan. However, in order
to support the institution building program, during negotiations agreements
3/   In the case of ELETROPAULO and CPFL, each one also has an Executive
Vice-President.



- 14 -
were reached with the beneficiaries to continue (ELETROPAULO and LIGHT) or
initiate (CPFL) implementation of the agreed plans of action.
- Staffing and Training
2.20      The three beneficiaries have well defined policies for human
resources management and development, and adequate job grading and
performance evaluation systems which have resulted in adequate productivity
levels, good labor relations and great staff stability. They all have
training programs of their own which are complemented by ELETROBRAS' training
program, especially for managers, and other training programs available in
the sector and in the country. During recent years, foreign currency
restrictions have limited training outside Brazil which is needed to maintain
technological updating and supplement the existing local programs. To attain
this objective suitable training components have been included under the
proposed sub-projects of each beneficiary which would, inter-alia, finance
the foreign exchange costs of technical studies and trips abroad, and a
fellowship program (see para. 4.09).
- Planninz and Budgeting
2.21      The beneficiaries are under the planning regulations of the
Government, both on the physical and financial areas. They all have adequate
budget systems which are well structured and closely integrated to their
accounting and treasury systems. The medium and long-term financial planning
is improving and a computer model developed by ELETROBRAS (Modelo
Corporativo) is used by all of them. In general, corporate planning systems
integrate the planning functions of all areas.
2.22      Planning of the power system is in general well organized and
satisfactory. Expansion planning for the subtransmission system is
coordinated with ELETROBRAS so that it takes into account the requirements
and characteristics of the interconnected system. Expansion planning for the
distribution system is based on reasonable planning and design criteria.
However, this process has been disrupted in the past by financial
constraints established by the Government, for it has been necessary to
introduce frequent changes to the expansion programs and questions about the
adequacy of existing planning methodologies have been raised (para. 4.07).
- Accounting and Auditing
2.23      A new uniform system of accounts was established by the Brazilian
Government in 1978 and it is still being implemented by ELETROPAULO and
LIGHT. All three beneficiaries have efficient accounting systems that allow
them to issue their financial statements in a timely fashion, usually within
the twenty days after the end of each month. With different degrees of
involvement in the data processing systems, the beneficiaries have their own
internal auditing units and adequate internal control systems. They all have
independent auditors to review their accounts, and during negotiations they



- 15 -
agreed to appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and to send
their audited financial statements within four months after the end of their
fiscal year.
- Billing and Collection
2.24      The billing and collection systems of the beneficiaries are
efficient as their receivables have been from 27 to 48 days during the last
four years. The billing system is mostly computerized and well integrated
with the accounting and treasury systems.
- Insurance
2.25      The insurance policies of the three beneficiaries are under review
in the institution building program (see para. 2.19) but no major
deficiencies have been identified. There is an on-going process of updating
the coverage values when coverage is below replacement cost. At the same
time, the beneficiaries have initiated a program of exclusion from insurance
coverage of goods and installations with little or no casualty risk.
- Operation
2.26      ELETROPAULO's and LIGHT's monitoring of their distribution system
is not adequate. They currently have outmoded operation centers and lack
basic information about the distribution system. A project to modernize the
supervision and control facilities and to develop adequate system maps and
computerized data bases for these two beneficiaries is under preparation
(para. 4.12). Unlike LIGHT and ELETROPAULO, CPFL implemented several years
ago modern supervision and control facilities, as well Rs system maps and
data bases, and has successfully improved the efficiency of the operations
with these tools. It is now planning to continue one step forward in the use
of computerized systems, by introducing on-line access to its data base and
upgrading its supervisory control facilities.
- Prior Bank Lending
2.27      Although between 1949 and 1959 four loans were made to Brascan,
LIGHT's parent company at that time, LIGHT has participated in only two Bank
operations: as borrower under loan 887-BR (04/73) and as beneficiary under
loan 2364-BR (12/83). The proposed operation would be the second loan to
ELETROPAULO since it is also a beneficiary under loan 2364-BR. This loan
finances investments in power distribution for low-income consumers, while
the proposed operation comprises other investments in power distribution not
related to low-income consumers. The project financed under loan 2364-BR
suffered substantial delays during the initial period of implementation due
to major revisions of the tender documents required to comply with the Bank's
procurement guidelines, but it is now under accelerated implementation as
such difficulties have been overcome. For CPFL, the proposed loan would be
the second Bank operation as it was a borrower under loan 477-BR (12/66).
CPFL's program was successful in terms of achieving its objectives, and the
financial performance of CPFL was better than the appraisal estimates.

3. THE MARKET
Introduction
3.01      The market studies carried out by the beneficiaries follow the
methodologies established by the Technical Committee for Market Studies
coordinated by ELETROBRAS, and are consistent with the studies used by the
corresponding technical groups, responsible for the long and medium term
planning of the power sector.
3.02      The power sector is now projecting an annual rate of growth for
total electric energy sales in the country of 8.7% for 1984-1987 and 7.5%
for 1987-1990, which is lower that the observed in the past decade (10%).
This is consistent with projected economic growth, and with the assumption
that energy conservation measures, including real tariff increases, will be
taken. Projected rates of growth by regions for 1984-1990 vary from 6.1%
p.a. for the most developed ones like the Southeast, to 32% p.a. for less
developed "frontier' states in the northern region. This projection has
been discussed with the Bank and was found to be reasonable (para. 1.10).
3.03      Market data, demand projections, and energy balances for the
three beneficiaries are discussed below.
ELETROPAULO
- Historical Data
3.04      ELETROPAULO serves a relatively small but highly populated and
industrialized area (Sao Paulo and its environs) of the State of Sao
Paulo. In a service area of about 22,000 km2, ELETROPAULO served about 4
million consumers in 1984, corresponding to an electrification rate of
about 75%. Total electricity sales in 1984 were 35,500 GWh (24% of total
sales in Brazil) of which 55% to the industrial sector.
3.05      The rate of growth of electricity sales slowed down sharply in
the period 1981-1983 (to about 2%, from previous rates of about 9Z) due to
the economic recession. In 1984, however, sales resumed previous high
rates as a result of the reactivation of the economy, and most importantly,
of sales for energy substitution amounting to about 6% of total sales (see
Annex 3.1.1)
- Demand Forecasts
3.06      The energy demand projection prepared by ELETROPAULO was based on
economic and demographic data, industrial expansion plans and energy
substitution prospects for its service area. An annual rate of growth of
about 9% is projected for 1984-1987, dropping to 5% for 1987-1990 (see
Annex 3.1.1). The reduction in the rate of substitution of electricity for
oil in thermal processes in industry, resulting from the application of the
EGTD tariff explains this drop. In fact, EGTD contracts already signed are
expected to increase the contribution of the energy substitution component



- 17 -
from 6% of total demand in 1984 to about 11% in 1986; afterwards, its
contribution levels off at 12%, when the EGTD contracts are terminated (end
of 1986) and EGTD is replaced by higher EFST and ETST tariffs (see para.
6.06). Total sales are projected at a moderate annual rate of growth of
about 6.8X for 1984-1990, well below the rate sustained in the 70's (9%
p.a.), which is consistent with the projected rate for the Southeast region
and with the assumption that energy conservation measures will be taken
(para. 3.02).
- Energy Balance
3.07      ELETROPAULO generates about 7% of its energy requirements in
various hydroelectric plants with a total installed capacity of 920 MW; the
rest is purchased from the interconnected system (FURNAS and CESP).
Energy purchases will continue to increase in the future as its generating
system will not be expanded (Annex 3.1.2). Total transmission and
distribution losses in recent years were about 7%, a reasonable value.
LIGHT
- Historical Data
3.08      LIGHT serves a relatively small (12159 km2) but highly populated
and industrialized area of the State of Rio de Janeiro. As of 1984 it
distributed electricity to about 2.2 million consumers. Total electricity
sales in 1984 were 16,600 GWh (11% of total sales in Brazil) of which 43%
to the industrial sector.
3.09      The rate of growth of electricity dropped sharply in 1981 to 1%,
from previous rates of about 8X, coinciding with the economic recession.
Sales resumed in 1982 their previous high growth rates and maintained these
rates in 1983 and 1984 mainly as a result of the reactivation of the
economy (see Annex 3.2.1).
- Demand Forecasts
3.10      For 1985-1990 LIGHT is projecting an annual rate of growth of
sales of about 5.5%, with a small contribution of energy substitution that
is projected to increase from 2% to 5% of total sales in this period (see
Annex 3.2.1). The projected rate of growth of 5.5% p.a. is moderate and
well below the rate sustained in the late 70's (about 8%). As commented in
para. 3.02, it assumes that energy conservation measures would be taken.
- Energy Balance
3.11      LIGHT generates about 22% of its energy requirements in four
hydroelectric plants with a total installed capacity of 802 MW; the rest is
purchased from the interconnected system. As in the case of ELETROPAULO,
its own generation system is not expected to be expanded in the future, and
it will rely on purchases to meet increases in demand. Total
subtransmission and distribution losses are about 9%, which are reasonable
but in the high range for a power system liKe LIGHT's (See Annex 3.2.2).



- 18 -
CPFL
- Historical Data
3.12      CPFL serves a large area (about 93000 km2) in the State of Sao
Paulo, consisting of well developed rural areas (agroindustry, etc.) and
some relatively important industrial centers (e.g. Campinas). CPFL served
about 1.4 million consumers in 1984. Total electricity sales in 1984 were
9174 GWh (6% of total sales in Brazil) of which 49% to the industrial
sector.
3.13      Electricity sales, which were growing at a rate of about 12%
p.a. in the late 70's, slowed down gradually to a rate of 5% during
1981-1983 as a result of economic recession. Sales picked up in 1984 due
to the contribution of energy substitution, which amounted to 6Z of total
sales (see Annex 3.3.1).
- Demand Forecasts
3.14     For 1985-1990 CPFL is projecting an average annual rate of growth
of demand of about 7%, with an important contribution of sales for energy
substitution, which are expected to increase from 6% to 1lZ of total sales
in this period. The projected rate of growth of 7% p.a. is considered
moderate as compared to previous rates (12%) and is consistent with
forecast for the Southeast region. Once again, it assumes that energy
conservation measures would be taken (Para. 3.02)
- Energy Balance
3.i5      CPFL purchases most of its energy requirement from the
interconnected system (96% in 1984) and generates the rest in various
generating stations with an installed capacity of 117 MW. As in the case
of the other beneficiaries, CPFL will rely on energy purchases to meet
demand increases in the future. Total subtransmission and distribution
losses are in the range of 6% to 7%, a low value for a power system like
CPFL's (see Annex 3.3.2)

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Introduction
4.01      Investments in power distribution expansion were reduced in recent
years due to financial constraints applied to the power isector. As a result,
the current condition of the distribution systems of the major power
utilities in the country is not satisfactory. However, the economic
difficulties facing the country still place a constraint on the pace at which
investment may take place. Investments in distribution, as well as the
development of programs to improve efficiency and energy conservation have
been identified as investments of high prilority in the 1984-,988 Power Sector
Investment Program, which takes into account the financial constraints, and
was based on a minimum expansion program needed to meet a demand projected at
moderate rates of growth, with reliability levels lower than those
traditionally used in the sector for planning purposes (para. 1.14).
4.02      The proposed project supports the implementation of distribution
investment programs for ELETROPAULO, LIGHT, and CPFL, which are responsible
for about 45% of the electricity market in Brazil. This project, and the
proposed FURNAS-CHESF Power Transmission Project would allow distributing the
energy from large generation plants nearing completion to the most populated
and industrialized area in the country.
The Investments Programs
4.03      Despite past reduced investments programs, the three Beneficiaries
have managed to maintain average reliability and quality of service indices
better than the standards established by DNAEE (see Annex 4.1.1). However,
the reliability and quality of service in several areas within their systems
as well as the loading of substations and distribution feeders is far from
satisfactory (see Annexes 4.1.1 and 4.1.2).
4.04      The investment programs prepared by the beneficiaries are based on
expansion programs which give priority to meeting projected demand, restoring
or maintaining the reliability of key consumer groups (large industrial
consumers, transportation, health services, etc.), and developing modern
supervision and control facilities and adequate data bases for the operation
and planning of the system. Programs for the rehabilitation of generating
plant and distribution facilities have been reduced and delayed until the end
of the period 1985-1990.
4.05      The proposed expansion of power facilities for 1985-1990 is
sumnarized below:

Details of the investments programs for 1985-1990 for the three
beneficiaries are shown in Annexes 4.2.1. 4.3.1 and 4.4.1. These programs
are summarized below:
ELETROPAULO d/        LIGHT         CPFL

4.06      The investment programs shown above are consistent with the
investment limits established in the 1984-1988 Power Sector Investment
Program (para. 4.01) and in general, are the minimum required to meet
Drojected demand (total investment for the three Beneficiaries represents
only about 8Z of sector investment program). However, they would permit an
improvement in the current loading conditions of distribution facilities (see
Annex 4.1.2), specially in the case of LIGHT and ELETROPAULO, which present
relatively high average incremental costs per new connection and per peak
demand increment as shown below:

b/ Proposed increase expressed as a percentage of existing.
c/ All figures have been rounded-off.
d/ Corresponds to the 1985-1989 investment program.

fl Includes investments in supervision and control facilities (US$85
million), in communication facilities (US$31 million), in maintenance,
transportation, buildings and support facilities (US$82 million), and
most importantly, includes investments in works to be commissioned after
1989 (US$148 million).

Per demand increment (US$/kW)      410                703            287
It should be pointed out that LIGHT and ELETROPAULO have substantial
investments in costly underground distribution systems which increase their
average incremental costs.
4.07      Handling of the financial constraints in the preparation of the
Power Sector Investment Program was not fullv satisfactory. At the aggregate
level, presently neither ELETROBRAS nor the Government have adequate
methodologies to assess the adequacy of investments in power distribution.
At the power utility level, the distribution companies need to revise their
planning and design criteria in the light of economic considerations and
financial constraints, and should improve their methodologies to define
priorities in power distribution investments. To address the aforementioned
problems, two actions were taken: (i) a study on distribution planning at the
aggregate level is included in part D of the proposed project; and (ii) at
negotiations, agreement was reached with the beneficiaries to carry out by
December 31, 1987, studies aimed at improving the methodology for expansion
planning and design of their power systems. Furthermore, it is proposed to
carr y-out annuai reviews by the Bank of the Sector Development Plan and of
the beneficiaries' investment programs.
Description of Subprojects
4.08      The subprojects proposed for Bank financing consist of portions of
the investments programs for 1986-1989 for the three beneficiaries, and
studies and overseas training for strengthening distribution planning and
energy conservation programs. They exclude investments related to the
low-income consumer programs of LIGHT and ELETROPAULO that are being financed
under loan 2364-BR, to generation, and to rural electrification, as well as
investments involving electronic equipment subject to reserved procurement
(para. 4.12). The objectives of the project are: (i) to support the
expansion of distribution systems in highly industrialized areas; (ii) to
improve the operation and planning of the distribution systems and (iii) to
develop basic studies for preparing electric energy conservation programs.
4.09      In view of the relatively small and numerous works included in the
project and since it comprises portions of larger investment programs that
will be reviewed annually, the specific project components related to
distribution works are not described in detail. Global work quantities have
been established to determine project cost, financing and procurement
arrangements. The Beneficiaries have agreed to annual reviews of their
investment programs. They have also agreed to modify global work quantities
and the list of goods and services for the proposed subprojects if such
reviews find it necessary. The major project components are described below:



- 22 -
Part A: ELETROPAULO
a)   Construction of about 20,000 conductor-kms of subtransmission and
distribution lines, and 6,800 MVA of distribution substations, and
installation of about 1,400 MVA of distribution transformers, and
related ancillary equipment.
b)   Implementation of training program for ELETROPAULOS's staff in
distribution planning and operation, and energy conservation,
involving about 310 staff-months.
Part B: LIGHT
a)   Construction of about 13,500 conductor-kms of subtransmission and
distribution lines, and 830 MVA of distribution substations, and
connection of about 230,000 consumers, and related ancillary
equipment.
b)   Implementation of training program for LIGHT's staff in
distribution planning and operation, and energy conservation,
involving about 60 staff-months.
Part C: CPFL
a)   Construction of about 5,300 circuit-kms of subtransmission and
distribution lines, and 1000 MVA of distribution substations, and
installation of about 142 MVA of distribution transformers.
b)   Implementation of training program for CPFL's staff in distribution
planning and operation, and energy conservation involving about
70 staff-months.
Part D: ELETROBRAS
a)   Execution of an electric energy conservation study involving about
400 staff-months of work of a local group with the assistance of
consultants.
b)   Execution of a distribution planning study involving about 100
staff-months of work of ELETROBRAS's staff with the assistance of
consultants.
4.10      The objective of the electric energy conservation study is to
develop a good basis for defining priorities on conservation programs, and
preparing well structured and economically justified policies and programs
for electric energy conservation. It would comprise:
(i) assessment of electricity losses in the Power Sector.
(ii) assessment of the efficiency of electric appliances and equipment
available in Brazil and of potential for improving their
efficiency;



- 23 -
(iii)  analysis of electricity end use consisting of surveys of patterns
and intensity of electricity use by consumers, as well as
equipments used by consumers;
(iv)  development of adequate methodologies for the economic evaluation
of energy conservation programs;
(v)  assessment of the existing instruments and institutional
constraints for the implementation of conservation programs
(including, but not limited, to electricity pricing, taxation,
import duties, rules and regulations on appliances, etc).
This study will be completed by December 31, 1987.
4.11      The objectives of the distribution planning study are: (i) to
develop methodologies to assess the adequacy and priority of global
investments in power distribution; (ii) to propose adequate goals for the
reliability and quality of electricity service on a country-wide basis; and
(iii) to recommend improvements in the organization and staffing of
ELETROBRAS' distribution planning unit. This study will be completed by
December 31, 1987.
4.12      ELETROPAULO and LIGHT have included in their investment programs
the implementation of modern supervision and control facilities and
computerized data bases and system maps for improving their operations.
However, these works, which represent only 7% of their total investment
program, have been excluded of the project as they require data processing
and communication equipment that are reserved by law to be procured locally
(reserved procurement). As the implementation of these works is essential
for meeting the objectives of the project, ELETROPAULO and LIGHT will furnish
to the Bank, not later than March 31, 1986, an adequate program to implement
these works, and will carry them out not later than December 31, 1991.
Cost and Financing
4.13      The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies
is estimated at US$1,031 million, of which US$401 (or about 39% of total) is
the foreign exchange cost (direct and indirect). Interest during
construction and other finacial charges on the Bank loan amount to about
US$50 million. Detailed cost estimates are given in Annexes 4.2.2, 4.3.2 and
4.4.2, and are summarized below:

4.14      The project costs were prepared by the beneficiaries based on
detailed bills of quantities and Dec-1984 unit prices for equipment and
materials, and on construction costs according to recently awarded contracts
for similar works. They were reviewed by the mission and are considered to
be reasonable. The cost of consultant services were estimated based on an
average cost of about US$10,000 per staff-month. Costs include sales and
other taxes amounting to about 14% of total costs. Physical contingencies
were estimated at 10% for transmission lines and 5% for distribution and
other works and services. Price contingencies were calculated applying the
following annual escalation factors to both the foreign and local costs



- 25 -
(base plus physical contingencies) expressed in US$ equivalent: 5% in 1985,
7.5% in 1986, 8X for 1987 to 1990, and 5% after 1990. It was assumed that
the Cruzeiro would be devalued according to the differential between domestic
inflation and international inflation. Price contingencies correspond to a
seven year execution schedule consistent with the Bank standard disbursement
profile (para. 4.21).
4.15      The proposed Bank loan of US$312 million would cover 29% of the
total project financing requirements. The balance of 71% would be financed
from the internal resources of the beneficiaries and borrowings. To assist
the Government and the sector authorities in their efforts to improve the
financial condition of the sector during a period of very stringent financial
constraints, the Bank would finance interest due on the Bank loan during the
first four and half years of project construction, amounting to US$50
million.
Project Implementation
4.16      Engineering for the execution of subtransmission and distribution
works will be carried out by the beneficiaries with their own staff which
have extensive experience in this type of works. The energy conservation and
distribution planning studies will be carried out with the assistance of
consulting firms or individual consultants acceptable to the Bank under terms
of reference satisfactory to the Bank. Construction of subtransmission and
distribution works will be contracted with local construction firms, with the
following exceptions: minor expansions will be carried out by force account,
and in the case of CPFL, installation of substation equipment will also be
carried out by force account. These arrangements are considered to be
satisfactory taking into account the characteristics of the works and the
experience of the beneficiaries.
4.17      Procurement, manufacturing, installation and construction of the
different works included in the subprojects are expected to be carried-out
during the period July 1985 - December 1989. The proposed training programs
for the beneficiaries would be implemented during the period 1986-1989.
Details of these programs are included in Annex 4.5; the beneficiaries will
timely prepare and furnish to the Bank the detailed individual fellowship
plans. Performance indicators have been established to monitor the
beneficiaries operational and financial performance (see Annexes 4.2.4, 4.3.4
and 4.4.4).

4.19      The proposed loan would help finance the foreign exchange cost of
the project and would cover only a portion (29%) of the total estimated cost
of the project. Equipment, materials, and services that are not financed
with the proceeds of the Bank loan would be procured in accordance with the
beneficiaries' normal procedures which contemplate open bidding competition,
limited bidding and quotatiois depending on the estimated cost of goods and
services. Procurement under these conditions may or may not be the most
efficient and economic depending on the 'characteristics of the items. These
procedures are considered to be the most efficient and economic in the case
of equipment (such as poles) which are not likely to attract foreign bidders,
equipment with long delivery times (such as power transformers) required for
works to be commissioned during the first 1-1/2 years of project, and that
are already in the bidding process, and of services for the construction of
project works which are relatively small and technically simple, and are not
likely to attract any foreign contractors. ICB is considered to be the most
efficient and economic procedure for the rest of the equipment (amounting to
about US$270 million), and the correspoading amount has been classified as
reserved procurement (RP). The foreign component of the cost of goods under
reserved procurement was subtracted from the foreign cost to determine the
loan amount. RP is not expected to affect the economy or efficiency of the
project for in the past the local manufacturers have been competitive in
price and have met required delivery schedules and technical specifications.
4.20      Procurement of equipment and materials to be financed with the
proceeds of the Bank loan will be made according to Bank guidelines through
ICB procedures, except for small laboratory and testing equipment (not
exceeding a total of US$500,000 equivalent) that will be procured through
limited international bidding (see procurement schedules in Annexes 4.2.3,
4.3.3 and 4.4.3). As in previous power loans, Brazilian suppliers of
equipment or materials with a local aggregate value of at least 50% of the
price of the goods will be given a margin of preference of 15% or the
applicable import duties, whichever is lower. Consultants for carrying out
the distribution planning and the energy conservation studies will be
selected in accordance with Bank guidelines. All equipment contracts over
US$200,000 each, to be financed with the proceeds of the Bank loan, will be
subject to prior Bank review.
Disbursements
4.21      It is expected that the project will be executed in a four years
period because it consists of conventional and relatively small works that
normally are implemented in less than two years, and the beneficiaries have
proven experience in executing this type of works. However, according to
Bank experience with distribution projects in Latin America, the standard
disbursement profile of about seven years was utilized for calculating
disbursements from the loan (Annex 4.1.3), and for calculating price
contingencies.



- 28 -
4.22      Proceeds from the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed  against
expenditures, which should be submitted to the Bank fully documented for
contracts valued more than US$200,000 equivalent. Other expenditures would
be disbursed against statement of expenditures. The above proceeds would be
applied to:
a)   100% of foreign  expenditures for imported goods, or 100% of the
ex-factory cost for local goods, both procured under procedures
acceptable to the Bank;
b)   100% of the expenditures for overseas training and consultant
services;
To reduce the interval during which the beneficiaries would
finance with their own resources locally procured items to be financed by the
Bank loan, a Special Account will be opened with the Central Bank for payment
to local contractors, in an amount of US$10 million representing four months
of average expenditures. Withdrawals from the account would be made at the
rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the expenditures. The Central
Bank would send the corresponding statement of expenditures to the Bank,
which would consequently replenish the account. The loan closing date would
be on December 31, 1992.
Risks
4.23      The works included in the project do not involve major risks as
they are conventional and relatively simple, and the beneficiaries are
capable and well organized. Major risk would be the lack of counterpart
funds resulting from investments cuts imposed by the Government. To address
such risks, it is proposed that the Government should approve the
beneficiaries' investment programs, and would take or allow to be taken
measures to improve the financial situation of the Beneficiaries so that they
may be in a position to carry-out their programs.
Environment
4.24      The works included in the project consist mainly of overhead and
underground transmission lines, substations and other distribution facilities
to be constructed mostly in urban areas, and do not pose any environmental
problem because they are relatively small and in most cases they will
utilize existing rights of way. Besides, the beneficiaries design the works
with due regard to safety considerations.

5. FINANCES
Introduction
5.01      The present legal structure of sector finances is such that it is
fundamental to analyze the overall sector finances in order to interpret
adequately the finances of individual utilities. A system of financial
communicating channels has been established through the tariff and rate of
remuneration equalization scheme (Annex 1.1, para. 2 (d)), and the most
significant financial decisions are in the hands of the Federal Governme, :..
with little participation of the State Governments and the utilities.
5.02      The equalization scheme for tariffs and rates of remuneration is
implemented through the Global Guarantee Fund (RGG), a mechanism by which
companies with a rate of remuneration higher than the sector average make
payments to the RGG whereas companies with a rate of remuneration lower than
the sector average receive funds from the RGG, so as to equalize the
individual and the sector rates of remuneration. The Federal Government:
Ci) through DNAEE, approves the operating costs of the individual utilities
and establishes the contributions to and the allocation of RGG resources;
(ii) sets the levels of the reversion tax and, through ELETROBRAS, allocates
its resources, and (iii) through the Ministry of Planning, sets tariff
levels, investment ceilings and availability of financing for each utility.
5.03      The proposed loan has been prepared within the context of a sector
financial rehabilitation program (para. 5.10). The program objectives are to
assist the power sector, during particularly difficult times, to carry out
high priority investments in the context of the sector present needs.
Assistance through the proposed project is justified by the efforts that are
being made by the Government and the utilities through such a financial
rehabilitation program, to address the problems facing the sector. This
program has sector-wide scope, it includes measures that would positively
affect the finances of the beneficiaries and constitutes a suitable basis to
improve progressively the financial performance of the utilities in order to
enable them to carry out satisfactorily the proposed project and the other
works of their investment programs.
5.04      Consequently, this chapter presents a description of sector
finances followed by a description of the finances of the three
beneficiaries. The conditions resulting from the assumptions on which the
sector projections are based are given in detail after the sector financing
plan. In the case of the beneficiaries projections, each one shows the need
of additional funding. During negotiations, the beneficiaries agreed to
submit each year, by November 30, a financial plan for the following five
years, with detailed identification of the funding requirements for the
following year.   The Federal Government, and the State Government of Sao
Paulo, ELETROBRAS and CESP (as major shareholders) agreed to review annually
the funding requirements of the beneficiaries and to provide the necessary
resources for the beneficiaries to carry out their subprojects in a timely



- 30 -
fashion. The major shareholders and the beneficiaries agreed to take all the
measures necessary to (i) achieve debt service coverage ratios of at least
1.1 in 1985, 1.2 in 1986, 1.3 in 1987, 1.4 in 1988, and 1.5 in 1989 and
thereafter; (ii) limit borrowings to a maximum of 70% of their capital
expenditures for each year; and (iii) restrain the debt/equity ratio to a
maximum of 67/33.
Power Sector
- Historical Performance
5.05      In the early 1960's, the establishment of the new structure for
sector organization - which included (i) ELETROBRAS as the federally owned
holding company, (ii) ELETROBRAS subsidiaries as entities primarily
responsible for regional generation and transmission, and (iii) state
utilities as entities primarily responsible for distribution - was part of a
general scheme to make the power sector an important contributing factor to
Brazil's economic development. The corresponding policies included the
setting of realistic tariff levels and adequate equity contributions in face
of an ambitious investment program which would satisfy the national
electricity requirements.
5.06      As a result of these tariff policies, the consumer-based fund
generation and its contribution to the growing investment program increased
steadily through the mid-1970's, at which time the sector reached a peak of
financial soundness. In 1973, the net (after debt service) consumer-based
fund generation had a share of 56% in the sector's funding mix whereas
borrowings had a share of only 30%, the rest being equity contributions.
Coincidentally with such peak in sector financial soundness the sector
initiated an even more ambitious investment program which included three
major generating schemes: the Itaipu (12,600 MW) and Tucurui (7,600 MW)
hydroelectric projects, and the nuclear program. The heavy investment
program in non-oil-fueled generating schemes became more justifiable because
of the oil crisis. The oil crisis of the mid 1970's, however, also created a
different set of financial conditions for the Brazilian power sector: (i)
inflation affected substantially the unit costs of the investment program;
and (ii) the Government's fight against inflation resulted in a deterioration
of real tariff levels and of the consumer-based contribution to the
investment program. As a consequence of these conditions, the sector became
increasingly dependent on borrowings.
5.07      The increasing dependency on borrowings, compounded by increasingly
harder lending terms, created a heavy debt service burden for the sector in
the late 1970's and early 1980's. In 1983, the sector's debt service was,
for the first time, greater than the consumer-based fund generation, thus
resulting in a negative self-financing ratio for the sector investment
program.
- Forecast
5.08      After a review of sector finances with the Bank, the Federal
Government agreed in September 1981, to increase power rates in real terms by
at least 3% in 1982 and by at least 5Z in 1983 and thereafter, until the



- 31 -
annual 10% rate of return for the power sector as a whole has been
attained--which is required by Brazilian law--and shortfalls occurring
since 1978 have been recovered. However, because of slippage in the dates of
rate increases, and slow growth in demand, sector revenues had not expanded
as expected. Consequently, in December 1983 the Government and the Bank
agreed on a series of measures aimed at improving the financial situation of
the sector. Such measures include a commitment from the Government that the
electric power sector will reach a 10% financial rate of remuneration in
1989, to be achieved by improving the rate of return by one point each year.
It is to be achieved through tariff increases and other measures aimed at
reducing operating costs. To achieve the agreed rate of remuneration in 1984
and 1985 the Government agreed to increase tariffs by 5% in real terms each
year. Beyond 1985, the Government agreed to review with the Bank by January
1986, the financial performance of the power sectnr and to agree on a program
of tariff increases and other measures required to achieve the agreed rates
of remuneration targets in future years. Failure to achieve the agreed rates
of remuneration and to reach agreement on the program of tariff increases for
1986 and thereafter by January 15, 1986, shall entitle the Bank to suspend
disbursements under all loans to the power sector in Brazil. The tariff
increases are to be achieved through a series of quarterly tariff
adjustments. The increases are to be made effective no later than February
1, May 1, August 1, and November 1, each year. The increases of February 1
and May 1 are to include one-half each of the real increase that has been
agreed for the year. So far the Government has complied with the 1983
agreement. Tariff increases have been introduced on the dates agreed with
the Bank. In fact in 1985, the Government has already increased tariffs by
5% in real terms. The increases were introduced in February and March
instead of February and May as provided by the agreement with the Bank.
Also, as provided in the 1983 agreement, the sector reached the agreed 5%
rate of return in 1984. Although the success of the sect-r's financial
rehabilitation depends basically on increasing the consumer-based fund
generation, two other conditions are quite important to enstire such success:
(i)  rationalization and curtailment of the sector investment program
through a greater emphasis on transmission/dist-ibution development
in order to balance the heavy generation investnents made in the
past, and no-growth in investments until 1988; Pnd
(ii)  reduction of the indebtedness pressure on sector finances through
an improvement in the debt profile and a decreasing reliance on
borrowings as a source of financing.
5.09      As provided by the 1983 agrepment, the Brazilian Government and the
Bank will hold in January 1986 a meeting to agree on the measures necessary
to achieve the annual rate of remuneration targets beyond 1985. Those
measures will most likely include actions to increase the level and to modify
the structure of electricity tariffs. The average electricity price level in
Brazil is low, both on financial and economic grounds, and needs to be
increased to improve the sector's finances and the country's internal
savings. The tariff structure has been disrupted in the last few years



- 32 -
through a series of special tariffs, basically for oil substitution and
export promotion, which are a fraction of the already low normal industrial
tariffs. Under these conditions, neither the tariff level nor the tariff
structure are conducive to electricity conservation. As a result of this
tariff scheme, during the last few years electricity consumption grew at
fairly high rates despite a null or low rate of growth in the country's
economy (para. 1.10). In line with its policy for energy conservation and
its intention to rehabilitate the finances of the sector, the Government's
intention now is to increase tariffs over a reasonable period of time to be
in line with long-run marginal costs (para. 5.12 (b)).
- Financing Plan
5.10      Under the 1984-1988 Sector Development Plan, the Government with
assistance from the Bank, prepared during 1984 a financial plan to enable the
sector to finance the 1984-1988 investment program and to rehabilitate the
financial condition of the sector 5/.

- 33 -
5.11      This plan shows that the objective of financial rehabilitation of
the power sector will be attained during the projection period (1984-1988) as
the deteriorating trend in sector finances will be reversed. Even though the
level of sector finances is not expected to be satisfactory during the first
half of the projection period, an improvement in the sector's funding mix
will start at that time as the consumer-based contribution will
increase steadily whereas the reliance on borrowings will decrease and the
sector is expected to reach an adequate level of financial soundness at the
end of the projection period.
5.12      The main assumptions of the sector financial plan (Annex 1.2)
reflect the necessary conditions to rehabilitate the power sector finances.
As part of its justifying rationale, the proposed loa- would support the
efforts made by the Government and the sector to attain such rehabilitation.
The main features of the plan are as follows:
(a)  Investment Program and Financial Plan (see paras. 1.14 to 1.16):
Prior to loan negotiations the Government informed the Bank of its
intentions to carry-out the 1984-1988 investment program and
financial plan prepared by ELETROBRAS and found to be acceptable by
the Bank. The Government is now reviewing the Plan to ensure that
it is in line with the national economic program. It has informed
the Bank that by July 1, 1985 it would send to the Bank an approved
1984-1988 Investment Program and Financial Plan. Consequently, the
following agreements were reached with the Government during
negotiations:
(i) as a condition of loan effectiveness the Government would
present to the Bank a satisfactory 1984-1988 investment
program and financial plan, formally approved by the
Government;
(ii) the Government would submit to the Bank by November 30 of each
year an updated five-year investment program and financial
plan, both to be satisfactory to the Bank;
(iii) the Government would carry-out the five-year investment
program in accordance with appropriate administrative,
financial, engineering and public utility practices and shall
provide or cause to be provided to the sector the funds and
other resources required in accordanc with the provisions in
the five-year financial plan; and
(iv) the Government would take all actions expected to enable the
electric power sector companies to carry-out a program
satisfactory to the Bank aimed at reducing over a reasonable
period, the sector's reliance on borrowings.
(b)  Long-Run Marginal Cost Study:  During negotiations the Government
agreed to prepare and agree with the Bank during i985 on a plan of
action to complete implementation by December 1989, of the
recommendations of the long-run marginal cost study that is being
financed by the Bank (Loan 1939-BR).



- 34 -
Cd)  Itaipu Tariffs:  During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government that if tariffs for bulk sale of electricity
generated at Itaipu were to exceed the levels charged by Brazilian
power suppliers in the South, Southeast and Central-Western regions
of Brazil, the Federal Government would promptly take measures
required to offset cost increases arising from high Itaipu tariffs
and to ensure that the rates of remuneration agreed with the Bank
are met.
ELETROPAULO
- Historical Performance
5.13      On March 31, 1981 ELETROPAULO bought the Sao Paulo subsystem from
LIGHT for the price of Cr$ 115.0 billion, equivalent to US$ 1.5 billion at
the then prevailing exchange rate of Cr$ 76.15 per US$. The payment was made
as follows:

(of 3/31181)   (of 3/31/81)

Debentures (with a 30-year repayment period
including a 10-year grace period, and

TOTAL                      115.0         1,510.0



- 35 -
The acquisition was a substantially leveraged operation as the State
Government of Sao Paulo, through Departamento de Aguas e Energia Eletrica
(DAEE) subscribed Cr$ 11.0 billion in shares, but only paid Cr$ 2.0 billion
in 1981. When considering the subscribed capital, the State Governent
participated with less than 1OZ of the initial capitalization which gave it
control of the company but resulted in a serious financial imbalance in the
capital structure, especially because LIGHT's preferred shares have the
characteristics of long-term debt.
5.14      The imbalance in the capital structure has resulted in a heavy
burden of dividend and debt service payments which the company has not been
able to cover with its gross internal fund generation. This critical
condition in company finances coincided with that of the sector and was
further compounded by the fact that in 1983 and 1984 ELETROPAULO decided to
use its scarce resources in its investment program and to stop payments to
the global guarantee and reversion funds (see Annex 1.1, para. 2 (d) and
para. 5.02 above). At the end of 1984, ELETROPAULO owed the Federal
Government about US$82.5 million for this concept and the corresponding
arrears carried an accumulated fine of about US$136.5 million.
- Forecast
5.15      In the financial projections of ELETROPAULO (see Annex 5.1.2) it
has been assumed that an equity contribution equivalent to the fines owed to
the guarantee and reversion funds will be made available, without having yet
identified the source, on the basis that such a problem should not remain
pending and that its solution could have different alternatives. In fact,
the departing federal administration was already considering a decree to
condone or reduce the fines resulting from these arrears (of ELETROPAULO and
other companies). Unfortunately, a draft decree in that sense was not
officially passed and its processing has been left to the newly elected
Government. During negotiations, the Federal and State Governments,
ELETROBRAS and ELETROPAULO agreed to present a satisfactory solution to the
problem of arrears to the guarantee and reversion funds, including the
corresponding fines, within the context of the sectoral financial
rehabilitation measures included in the 1984-1988 Sectoral Financial Plan
(see para. 5.12(a)).
5.16      The financial outlook of ELETROPAULO shows an improving trend which
follows the general trend expected for the sector as the rates of
remuneration increase by one percentage point in compliance with the November
1983 Government/Bank agreement (see para. 5.08). During the 1985-1990
period, the debt service coverage ratio is expected to improve from 1.2 times
to 1.5 times, the self-financing ratio from 8.9% to 45.3%, and the
debt/equity ratio from 64/36 to 60/40 (see Annex 5.1.4). However, because
of its weak capital structure, ELETROPAULO will need to finance its debt
service through equity and new loans if it is to achieve such ratios. Also
important for ELETROPAULO's finances will be to change its debt profile as
the average maturity is now from 8 to 10 years (see Annex 5.1.4). Such
conditions seem to be forthcoming as negotiations of new loans for the
country give evidence that they will carry a minimum 14-year repayment
period. The financial plans for ELETROPAULO to be submitted by November 30
of each year (see para. 5.04) would be supported by confirmation that the
terms of the loans to ELETROPAULO will be changed satisfactorily and that
ELETROPAULO will have a more balanced capital structure.

5.17      A summary of the corresponding financial plan for the 1985-1990
period is given below and it shows that a substantial improvement in
ELETROPAULO's finances will be attained under the conditions set forth under
the financial rehabilitation plan for the sector and the specific conditions
applicable to ELETROPAULO as described in the previous paragraph (the
detailed composition of this financial plan can be seen in Annex 5.1.2).

LIGHT
- Historical Performance
5.18      By selling the Sao Paulo subsystem to ELETROPAULO (see para.5.13)
in 1981, LIGHT's asset composition changed as follows:
1981
March 31     December 31
Fixed assets                              89.4%          41.2Z
Financial and other investments            0.6%          45.1Z
Current assets                            10.OZ          13.7%
100.0Z         100.O0
5.19      In spite of existing legislation for the equalization of rates of
remuneration within the sector (see para. 5.02), DNAEE allowed a higher rate
of remuneration for LIGHT than the sector average. Thus LIGHT's rates of
remuneration for 1981-1984 were 9.1%, 7.6%, 8.6Z and 7.0%, while the sector
average rates of remuneration *'cre 7.7%, 6.1%, 5.1% and 5.0X6/
respectively.  This preferciltial treatment to LIGHT stems from the Federal
Government's decision to maintain LIGHT's high credit-worthiness level and
from broad interpretation of the legislation regarding equalization of rates
of remuneration.
5.20      Within this context. in 1984 LIGHT's financial operations resulted
in a net profit as the sum of dividend and interest revenues was greater than
the amounts of interest on debt, showing an atypical condition for a
Brazilian electric utility and its similarity to an investment institution.
This was possible in part because of its investments at ELETROPAULO which
dividends and interest payments are mostly tied up to LIGHT's rate of
remuneration (see para. 5.13), and also because LIGHT has been used by
ELETROBRAS to channel relending operations for the ELETROBRAS group which, in
turn, yielded additional revenues in the form of commissions. Its gross
internal funding has been more than sufficient to cover its net debt service
(after dividend and debt service receipts) and has resulted in a debt service
coverage ratio of about 1.5 times in the 1981-1984 period and a low reliance
on borrowings for its electricity investments in 1983-1984 (2%).
- Forecast
5.21      As the sector's financial condition improifes under the
rehabilitation program, LIGHT's financial condition will improve even
further. During the 1985-1990 projection period the average rate of
remuneration would be equal to that of the sector and the company would
continue having profits
6/   Source: 1981-1983, DNAEE; 1984, mission estimate.



- 38 -
from its financial operations. As a consequence, the debt service coverage
ratio is expected to be on the average 2.3 times, the self-financing ratio
74.2Z, and the debt/equity ratio 33/67.
- Financing Plan
5.22      The following table summarizes the financing plan of LIGHT for the
1985-1990 period, as show-n in more detail in Annex 5.2.2 and as described in
the previous paragraph. The plan is realistic as the share of borrowings in
the total funding mix is low for a company with LIGHT's characteristics.

CPFI
- Historical Performance
5.23      CPFL is an efficient company (see Annex 4.4.4) which has had its
finances affected by the general sector conditions and by the funding
restrictions of the country in general. Its rate of remuneration fell from
10.3% in 1981 to 3.5% in 1983, which is lower than the sector average of 5.1Z
This difference shows a discrepancy between the calculations made by DNAEE
and the company. In fact, CPFL is being required to make contributions to
the global guarantee fund thus implying a rate of remuneration higher than
the sector average before the contribution and at least equal to the sector
average after the contribution, by the official count. The discrepancy
arises from different criteria as to what should be included in the cost of
service. Because of this, CPFL stopped paying to the guarantee and reversion
funds and at the end of 1984 had a debt of US$46.1 million of which US$25.0
correspond to the amount of revalued principal and US$21.1 to fines. During
negotiations it was agreed that the Federal Government, ELETROBRAS and CPFL
would present an acceptable solution to this problem, within the context of
sectoral financial rehabilitation measures included in the 1984-1988 Sectoral
Financial Plan (see para. 5.12(a)).
5.24      The financial difficulties of CPFL were compounded by the fact that
since 1981 it increasingly relied on short-term borrowings. In the
allocation of long-term funding available for companies of the sector in Sao
Paulo, greater priority was given to the generation projects of CESP, the
parent company of CPFL, and only short-term borrowings were made available to
CPFL at high interest rates. Thus in 1983 the current maturity was 5 years
and the average interest rate was about 17Z (see Annex 5.3.4).
- Forecast
5.25      A reversal  n the deteriorating trend of CPFL finances can be
achieved by modifying its debt profile, i.e. changing the medium-term debt
into long-term debt, and reducing the interest rates it pays. This is
attainable as the indebtedness of CPFL is still within acceptable limits
(debt/equity ratio of 57/43) and the terms of borrowings now under
negotiations by the Government would be adequate for this purpose. The
financial plan for CPFL to be submitted by November 30 of each year (see
para. 5.04) would be supported by confirmation that the terms of loans to
CPFL will be changed satisfactorily.
5.26      If the conditions set for the financial rehabilitation of the
sector are complied with, they will also firm up the rehabilitation of CPFL's
finances during the 1985-1990 projection period as the company will reach a
10% rate of return in 1989, generate enough internal funds to cover its debt
service 1.2 times, make a contribution to investment of 47.6%, and have an
average debt/equity ratio of 54/46 (see Annex 5.3.4).
- Financing Plan
5.27      The corresponding financing plan is feasible as the share of
borrowings (41.4%) in the total funding mix is reasonable for a company with
CPFL s characteristics. The financial projections included in the group of
annexes 5.3 give details of such forecast and are summarized in the following

6. ECONOQIC ANALYSIS
- Introduction
6.01      The proposed subprojects represent only a portion of the
beneficiaries investment programs in distribution and subtransmission and
do not constitute by themselves well defined components whose benefits
could clearly segregated from those of the investment programs. Therefore,
the following analysis presents a calculation of the economic rate of
return of the investment programs as a whole, and a discussion about the
least-cost solution for the expansion of the power system. Additionally, a
discussion on the energy substitution program is presented.
- Least Cost Solution
6.02      The expansion program of the subtransmission and distribution
systems of the beneficiaries is based on a demand projected at moderate
rates of growth and on the application of reasonable planning criteria.
When reasonable alternatives existed for the power system expansion (e.g.
new supply points for the distribution network) the beneficiaries selected
the least-cost alternative at a discount rate of about IIZ. In most of the
cases, however, no reasonable alternatives exist, because investments
involve expansion of existing installations which should use predefined
sites and right of ways. In these cases, the sizing and other
characteristics of the works are defined in accordance with standard
configurations which represent an economic solution. It is recommended,
however, to carry out a critical analysis of the planning and design
criteria currently used by the beneficiaries (para. 4.07).
- Rate of Return
6.03      The benefits and costs related to the investment program cannot
be exactly quantified and the use of proxys is required. First,
incremental revenues have been used as a proxy for the economic benefits
(however, tariffs are Government controlled and there are indications that
they understate the consumer willingness to pay). Second, bulk energy
tariffs have been used as a proxy for the cost of generation, because the
beneficiaries depend almost totally on energy purchases from the inter-
connected system to meet their demand. The impact on the rate of return of
costing electricity purchases at the long-run marginal generation cost is
also presented.
6.04      Annexes 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 show the details of the rate of return
calculation, and are summarized below:
Rates of Return
ELETROPAULO     LIGHT    CPFL
Energy purchase price equal to bulk tariff 23.0%          17.6%     33.3%
Energy purchase price equal to               8.7%          5.4%     17.0X
long-run marginal cost
Investment 20% higher                       18.9%        14.5%      28.4%
Investment 10% lower                        25.7%        19.5%      36.5%



- 42 -
Some basic assumptions are:
a)   the incremental revenues were estimated on the basis of average
retail tariffs prevailing at December, 1984 (inclusive of the
sole tax but exclusive of the compulsory loan) and projected with
real tariff increases necessary to attain the rate of
remuneration levels agreed on November, 1983 between the Bank and
the Brazilian Government;
b)   the cost of energy purchases were estimated on the basis of bulk
energy tariffs prevailing at December, 1984 and projected
increases consistent with a) above. These tariffs are lower than
the long run marginal generation cost (preliminary results of the
tariff study (para 5.09) show that the LRMC for the Southeastern
region is about 33 US mills/kWh). The impact on the rate of
return of using the marginal cost was analyzed above assuming
that the purchase price would be equal to the LRMC as of 1989.
6.05      Some conclusions can be drawn from the aforementioned results:
a)   the price differential between the average retail tariff and the
average price for energy purchases (about 100%) is sufficient to
yield an adequate financial rate of return for the beneficia-
ries. However, this does not mean that the projected retail
tariffs are adequate; on the contrary, the above results show
that they do not provide an adequate rate of return when the long
run marginal cost for bulk energy purchases is considered. This
is consistent with the findings of the DNAEE tariff study, which
indicates that retail tariffs do not reflect appropriately long
run marginal costs;
b)   those beneficiaries which are investing more in the
rehabilitation of their power systems, or whose incremental
investment costs per consumer are higher (LIGHT and ELETROPAULO)
have the lowest rate of returns. It should be pointed out,
however, that the benefits of rehabilitating the system are not
explicitly taken into account in the economic analysis. However,
these rates of return are still higher that the opportunity cost
of capital in Brazil, currently estimated at 11%.
- The Energy Substitution Program
6.06      Since 1982 the Government established promotional rates for the
substitution of electricity for oil in industrial processes, mainly ovens
and boilers. This rate (EGTD: guaranteed energy for specifted time) has
already induced a considerable amount of energy substitution (DNAEE
estimates that contracts signed as of September, 1984 add up to 2100 MW or
11.4 TWH/year, corresponding to a potential substitution of 30,000 barrels
of oil per day). Taking into account that the power system had already
used up surplus energy and other reserves available, and that the marginal
cost for meeting additional energy substitution was not longer very low,
the Government decided to stop signing additional EGTD contracts as of
September 1984, and to terminate as of December 1986 the EGTD tariff and
replace it by new tariffs more in line with the costs of the system. These
are: (i) the firm energy substitution tariff (EFST) priced at about 80% of



- 43 -
normal industrial tariff, and (ii) the temporary energy substitution tariff
(ETST) priced according to short run marginal costs, and applicable only to
interruptible loads.
6.07      The demand projections prepared by the beneficiaries (paras. 3.06,
3.10 and 3.14) contemplate in.general, moderate increases in the market for
energy substitution consistent with the new tariffs established by the
Government and with an economic analysis of the potential loads. Details of
a methodology developed by ELETROBRAS to analyze the potential loads, as well
as results of its application to the beneficiaries, are presented at Annex
6.4.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      In addition to the standard clauses in power projects, during
negotiations agreement was reached on the following main points:
(a)  With the Federal Government, that it would:
(i) by November 30 of each year, furnish to the Bank an updated
five-year investment program and corresponding financial plan
both to be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.12(a)(ii));
(ii) carry-out the five-year investment program in accordance with
appropriate administrative, financial, engineering and public
utility practices and provide, or cause to be provided, the

to implement, by December 1989, the recommendations of the
long-run marginal cost study financed by Loan 1939-BR (para.
5.12(b)); and
(v) promptly take measures to offset cost increases arising from
high Itaipu tariffs and to ensure that the agreed rates of
return were met if tariffs for bulk sale of electricity
generated at Itaipu were to exceed the levels to be charged by
Brazilian suppliers in the South, Southeast and
Central-Western regions of Brazil (para. 5.12(c)).
(b) With the Federal Government, ELETROBRAS, State Government of Sao
Paulo, and CESP:

study to assess the adequacy of power distribution investments,
and the reliability and quality of electric service, and to
support the implementation of the program referred to in (ii)
above (para. 4.11);
Ci") on relending US$310 milion of the loan proceeds to the
beneficiaries on che same terms and conditions as those of the
Bank loan (para. 2.01); and

Brazil power sector (para. 2.01):
- keeping adequate accounting records;
- engaging the service of independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank;
- Bank's concurrence for major investments;
- progress reporting;
- access to works and information;
- seeking Bank's concurrence for any new borrowings if debt
service coverage ratio falls below 1.5 times;
- procurement according to Bank guidelines;
- revenues according to legislation; and
- opening of special account at the Central Bank in the amount
of US$10.0 million, to pay local suppliers.
7.02     As a condition of loan effectiveness:
(a)  the subsidiary loan agreement between ELETROBRAS and one of the
beneficiaries, satisfactory to the Bank, would have been signed
(para. 2.01); and
(b)  the Federal Government would present to the Bank a satisfactory
1984-1988 investment program and financial plan formally approved by
the Federal Government (para. 5.12(a)(i)).
7.03     As a condition of disbursements for each beneficiary, the respective
subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would have been signed.
7.04     Any change in sector legislation, or failure to implement the tariff
agreements, which may adversely affect the operations or financial
performance of the borrower or beneficiaries would be an event of default.
7.05     With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$312 million, to be repaid over a period of 15
years, including three years of grace.

BRAZIL
POWER SECTOR
ELECTRICITY REVENUES
1.   Consumer bills contain the following charges:
(a) The basic tariff, which on a nationwide basis, provides about 80%
of revenues collected from consumers.
(b) The sole tax (IUEE) on residential, commercial and small
industrial6! consumer bills, which provides about 12% of sector
revenues. Forty percent goes to the Federal Government, fifty
percent to state and federal utilities, and ten percent to
numnicipal utilities; and
Cc) The Compulsory Loan (8% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers using more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding 6%
annual interest and revalued through monetary adjustments).
2.   The basic tariffs are set at a level designed to cover:
(a) operating, maintenance and administrative costs;
-b) taxes other than income, principally property taxes;
Cc) straight-line depreciation on gross fixed assets at rates of 5% for
thermal facilities, 4% for distribution and 3Z for hydro
facilities;
(d) a charge of plant in service reduced by the sum of accumulated
consumer advances, contributions and grants (the -Reversion
Base"). This charge consists of:
(i) a tax of up to 4% of the Reversion Base levied by the
Government, the proceeds of which are credited to the Global
Reversion Fund. This fund is used to compensate utility
companies when their concessions revert to or are taken over
by government and to help finance electric utility expansion
programs throughout Brazil;
6/   Industries using less than 2,000 kWh per month.

(ii)  contributions to the Global Guarantee Fund, a mechanism
designed to assist in the equalization of electricity charges
throughout the country.  Until 1980, the Global Guarantee Fund
(GGF), financed through a surcharge of up to 2Z on assets in
operation, was used in the tariff equalization process to
supplement the earnings of eligible utilities. In January
1981 the Brazilian Government expanded the role of GGF, from a
tariff equalization instrument to a rate of remuneration
equalization instrument for the sector.
(e) a fuel tax (ccc) earmarked to pay the fuel expense in each
interconnected system;
(f) a return of between 10% and 12% on remunerable investment.
3.   The remunerable investment consists of:
Ca) plant in service including capitalized interest, plus monetary
correction;
(b) less accumulated depreciation, monetarily corrected;
Cc) less the year-end sum of contributions from customers and
government grants;
Cd) plus other remunerable assets, including an allowance for working
capital and inventories; and
(e) less the accumulated excess in previous years remuneration.

year, equal to the 1984 level;
*c)  as per Government-Bank agreement of November 1983, tariff
increases, in real terms, would be implemented each year to achieve
the rates of return of 52 in 1984, 6% in 1985,         , and 9% in
1988;
cd) Itaipu tariffs for sale of electricity to the Brazilian power
sector would he equal to similar sector tariffs for hulk supply in
the South-Southeast region;
(e)  compensation to the sector for the nuclear plants, equal to the
difference in investment and operating costs of comparable hydro
plants in the least-cost sequence would be made to the power

SOUTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
TRAINING PROGRAMS
The training programs proposed for Bank financing are addressed to
upgrade and strengthen the skills of the beneficiaries' professional staff in
planning, operation, energy conservation, administration, and engineering of
distribution power systems. The proposed programs mainly comprise
participation at seminars and formal courses taken place abroad, and
technical visits to power utilities, manufacturers and other institutions in
foreign countries.   They are a complement to existing training programs for
professionals which are carried out in Brazil, for they only include areas of
study where overseas training is required and no adequate substitutes are
available in Brazil. The proposed training programs are general; however,
during the implementation of the programs specific individual programs would
be prepared by the beneficiaries before fellowshipsare authorized, and the
selected professionals would report their experiences and achievements upon
their return. A summary of the programs is presented below:

BRAZIL
SOUTHEAST POWER DTSRIBUTION PROJECT
BASIC ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF BENEFICIARIES
Ar             The financial projections of the beneficiaries have been prepared based
on assumptions which (i) follow, as far as possible, the basic assumptions
used to prepare the sector projections under the Financial Rehabilitation
Plan as agreed upon between the Bank and sector authorities (see Annex 1.2);
(ii) result from using the Modelo Corporativo computer program, accepted as
satisfactory by the appraisal mission as they reasonably reflect conditions
envisaged for Brazilian power utilities; and (iii) were agreed among oificers
of the Borrower, the Beneficiary and the Bank during appraisal mission. The
assumptions applicable to each beneficiary are given in each financial
statement.
As such, the basic assumptions used for the preparation of the
financial projections of the Beneficiaries are summarized below and are
referred to the sector projections for the Financial Rehabilitation Plan
(FRP), to the Modelo Corporativo (MC), and/or agreements during the appraisal
mission (AM).
A. Period: even though under the historical profile disbursements are
forecast to finish by mid-1992, the financial projections have been prepared
only for the 1985-1990 period as the improving paths of the beneficiaries
finances are clearly set during this period and the uncertainties of the
projections are significantly compounded for the 1991-1992 period (the
financial projections for the FRP were prepared for the 1984-1988 period
only).
B.  Price level (FRP): mid-1984 US dollars (1 USS - 1,700 CrS).
C. Rates of remuneration (FRP): 1985, 6%; 1986, 7%; 1987, 8%; 1988, 9%;
1989, 10%, and 1990: 11%
D.  Sales of electricity:  based on the FRP demand forecast.
E.  Tariff increases (FRP and AM):  1985, 5.0%; 1986, 8.5%; 1987, 9.3%;
1988, 8.3Z; 1989, 50%; and 1990, 5.0%.
(Different increases in average tariff may result because of changing
weight of each consumer class and tariff structure).
F. Operating expenses (labor, materials and services): 1985, based on
existing legislation; and 1986-1990, with a rate of growth equal to the
rate of growth of sales (FRP).
G. Equity contributions:
1. From State Governments: at least equal to the 1984 level, in real
terms (FRP).



- 89 -
ANNEX 5.4
PaeZof 3
2. From other shareholders: according to the particular conditions of
each beneficiary (AM)
H. Dividend reinvestment: 100Z for major shareholders (AN).
I. Sole tax reinvestment: 1002 of portions corresponding to state and
municipal governments (FRP).
J. Borrovings:
1. From out-of-sector resources, in foreign currency: with a 9-year
repayment period, including a 5 year grace period, and interest plus spread
equal to 12% p.a. The annual amounts of these borrowings destined to debt
service not to exceed the following percentages of total foreign currency
debt service:  1985, 80Z; 1956, 70%; 1987, 60%; 1988, 50%; and 1989-1990, the
amount of debt repayment in each year (FRP and AN).
2. From ELETROBRAS, in local currency:
a) for generation and transmission projects: a 15 year repayment
period including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate of 10Z p.a.
(RN);
b) for distribution and general property: a 12-year repayment
period including a 2-year grace period, and an interest rate of 101 p.a.
(AM).
3. The total amount of borrowings in a single year as a percentage of
total applications not to exceed 701 and to show a decreasing trend during
the projection period (AM and FRP).
4. Total debt as a percentage of fixed assets (indebtedness ratio) not
to exceed 67% in any single year (AM).
5. Debt service coverage ratios (see Annexes 5.1.4, 5.2.4 and 5.3.4),
not to be lower than those agreed upon under loan 2364-BR in the case of
LIGHT and ELETROPAULO, and to show a positive trend in the case of CPFL. In
all cases, to re&ah at least 1.5 times by 1988 (AM).
6. Disbursements of the proposed loan to be as follows: 2.5% in 1985,
14% in 1986, 23.5Z in 1987, 35% in 1988, 20% in 1989, and 5.0% in 1990,
consitent with project execution under investments (a longer period based on
historical series would result in better financial conditions as less
counterpart funding would be needed).
K. Investments: bases on the FRP investment program.
L. Working capital:
1. Accounts payable to suppliers and contractors: if any arrears
existed at year-end 1984, to be paid 50Z in 1985 and the rest in 1986 (this

condition is a result of pre-negotiations meetings under the proposed
co-financing operation for the FRP). The current balance of this account not
to exceed 20% of the investmebts made in that year (FRP).
2. Accounts payable to the reversion and guarantee funds: arrears at
the end of 1984 to be made current in 1985 (AM).
3. Accounts payable to electricity suppliers: function of payment
period under financial indicators (AM).
4. Cash and banks: funtion of short-term obligations (MC and AM'.
5. Accounts receivable, consumers: function of an improving trend of
collection period (MC and AM).
6. Other current assets and current liabilities: function of
historical series and of an improving current ratio (MC and AN).

Energy Substitution
The methodology developed by ELETROBRAS to prepare the economic
analysis of potential loads for energy subsatitution is described below:
(a) a breakeven cost for the conversion to electric energy (CES) is
calculated by process andior type of equipment. CES is compared to
the real cost of electricity supply (CEM) and, in those cases when
CES is greater than CEM, the substitution is considered to be
justifiable from the economic point of view;
(b) CES is calculated as the net benefit per kWh (exclusive of the
generation cost for electricity supply) associated with the
substitution;
Cc) the following benefits are considered:
Ci)  fuel savings;
(ii) reduction in fuel storage costs;
(iii)  benefits related to reduced air pollution, and
(iv) reduction in operation and maintenance costs of industrial
equipment;
(d)  the following costs are considered:
(i) investment in new equipment and works by the consumer;
(ii) investment in the subtransmission and distribution system
necessary to meet the demand increase resulting from the
substitution;
(e) CES is calculated for two cases: first, when the substitution is
expected to take place on a firm basis, i.e., about 10OZ of the
time; and second, when the substitution is expected to take place
on a non-firm or secondary basis, i.e. about 50% of the time;
(f) CEM is calculated based on the marginal cost of generation and
transmission for the interconnected system, and the characteristics
of the load curve related to the substitution;
(g) CEM is also calculated for two cases: firm energy, and secondary
energy;
(h) the potential loads are classified in one of the following
categories:
