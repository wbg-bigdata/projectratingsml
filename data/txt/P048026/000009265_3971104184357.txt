AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
Block 1: Project Description
1. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
1.1  The objective of the project is to assist His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HIMGN)
improve the management and capacity of agricultural research and extension services by (a)
developing location-specific agricultural technology on the basis of close consultation
with farmers; and (b) improving the technology delivery system.
2. PROJECT COMPONENTS
The project consists of an agricultural research component and an extension service component.
Agricultural Research Component (US$16.2 million)
2.1  The project would (a) strengthen the agricultural research institutions by improving the
management information system, priority setting of research programs, and monitoring
implementation and evaluating impact, (b) support human resource development by training
research scientists and introduce a reward system which is based on results and performance, (c)
expand on-farm adaptive research which is responsive to farmers needs, and (d) provide
facilities, infrastructure and working capital to enable the research institutions to accomplish
their tasks.
Extension Service Component (US$14.3 million)
2.3 The project would (a) strengthen the extension service by intensifying its decentralization to
the grassroots level and strengthening farmer self-help groups, (b) develop the human capital by
training extension staff, and implement a reward system based on results and performance (c)
provide facilities, infrastructure and working capital to enable individual participants to
accomplish their tasks.

3. BENEFITS AND TARGET POPULATION
3.1 The immediate benefits would accrue to the institutions and professional Nepalese engaged
in agricultural research and extension services in the country. By improving the efficiency of the
agricultural research and extension service delivery systems, the project would ultimately
enhance agricultural productivity thereby increasing rural income, employment, and food supply,
and reduce rural poverty. Specific direct benefits from the project would include (a)
establishment of more effective and efficient local institutions, (b) delivery of relevant
agricultural technology to farmers, (c) higher-quality and better-motivated agricultural extension



-3 -
and training staff, (d) better integration of research and extension, and (e) increased farmer
participation.
3.2 About 80 percent of Nepal's 20 million people are employed in agriculture. The project
would expand coverage to include about 10 million farmers, or 1.8 million households, an
increase of about 18 percent from the current 8.5 million or 1.5 million households covered.
Project beneficiaries would include women farmers, at least two-thirds of whom live below the
poverty line.
4. INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENT
4.1 The Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) and the Department of Agriculture
(DOA) will implement the project over five years. The private sector, NGOs, and farmers groups
would also be involved in planning and implementing project activities, including contract
research and technology transfer.
4.2 NARC and DOA have prepared plans to implement the project in thirty-one districts in two
phases. The first phase (up to midterm review) would include twenty-three districts. Depending
on the success of implementation of the first phase, (to be evaluated at the mid-term review) the
project would support the inclusion of the remaining eight districts.
The thirty-one districts selected to implement the project have a sufficiently developed enabling
environment and potential for improving agricultural production. These include:
(a) established albeit limited markets for agricultural inputs and production;
(b) basic infrastructure for delivery of research and extension services;
(c) functioning grassroots institutions; and
(d) suitable farming conditions for agricultural growth.
4.3 NARC and DOA would prepare detailed plans for phase two while they are implementing
the first phase. The details would include (a) organizing farmers into groups with the help of
local NGOs and community based organizations' support, (b) involving village and district-level
committees, (c) providing technical training to the field staff on project implementation and
identification of area-specific constraints to agricultural productivity.
4.4 NARC and DOA would implement the project according to a transparent decision-making
process and flow of funds. The project would provide a structure for policy-making and
management that would coordinate the involvement of other donors, thereby facilitating synergy
among donor-supported programs. This arrangement would enhance the Government's capacity
to integrate and manage support of the agricultural sector.



- 4 -
4.5 To strengthen and expand the institutional management capacity, the project would:
a) introduce an institutional framework (creating a steering and technical advisory committees
in MOA) to link the management of DOA and NARC through regular meetings and
implementation of joint activities;
b) improve the capacity of middle-level management staff through training to enhance their
ability to implement an effective decentralized system which responds to farmers' needs;
c) strengthen linkages between management and staff of research and extension through regular
interaction, for example holding joint meetings and workshops;
d) strengthen monitoring and evaluation to provide feedback to senior and middle-level
management of MOA and DOA;
e) promote synergy between programs supported by donors, NGOs, and the private sector and
programs of MOA and NARC, through organized regular meetings and workshops to share
information and technology;
f) reform the current resource-driven district plans and budgets, which are based on targets that
ignore quality and the trade-off between activities;
g) strengthen the administrative, accounting, and procurement capacity of NARC and DOA
through training to efficiently administer the IDA credit;
h) re-focus the work of DOA regional and district staff to enhance their effectiveness in serving
farmers' needs rather than providing local administrative services; and
i) motivate DOA field staff through training and provision of adequate allowances for travel, to
enable them to meet the growing demands from farmer groups as new farming systems
develop.
Conducive Changes in Strategy and Policy Guidance
4.6 The government has started to address some of the institutional weaknesses. For example it
has established an Agricultural Development Steering Committee in MOA to provide overall
policy and strategic guidance for project implementation. The committee would comprise the
Secretary of Agriculture (Chair); the Joint Secretary/Under Secretary Ministry of Finance and
National Planning Commission; the Executive Director, NARC; the Directors General of DOA,
Irrigation, and Livestock; the Joint Secretaries of Women Farmers Development Division
(WFDD), Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and Planning within the MOA; the Chairperson of
Project Technical Advisory Subcommittee; the General Manager of the Agricultural
Development Bank; and the Project Coordinator for the project as member-secretary.
4.7 The Steering Committee's strategy and policy guidance would include a vision for (a)
farmer involvement in the identification, design, and implementation of project activities; (b)
sustainability of research and extension activities; and (c) reduction of public sector involvement



-5-
and the increased role of the private sector in agriculture. Details of the functions and terms of
reference for the Steering Committee are given in Annex 2.
4.8 The Steering Committee would provide overall guidance for project implementation and
facilitate coordination of activities of other donors. As such, it would enhance the Government's
capacity to integrate donor supported programs into the Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP).
The immediate task of the Steering Committee would be to adopt and issue a Policy Framework
to guide NARC and DOA management and staff in implementing the project.
4.9 Also, the government has established an independent Technical Advisory Subcommittee to
review project activities and recommend to the steering committee appropriate action, thereby
enhancing the effectiveness and impact of the project. Additionally, the committee would
evaluate the project during the midterm review and make recommendations on its scope, design,
and implementation.
4.10 The government has appointed a qualified Nepalese professional to chair the Subcommittee
which includes members from the main stakeholders, including senior technical staff
representatives of extension and NARC; representatives of donors providing support to research
and extension, including the Bank, an IARC, and an NGO; a farmer representative; and the
Project Coordinator as member-secretary. Details of the Subcommittee's functions are given in
Annex 3.
Donor Coordination
4.11 The Agricultural Development Steering Committee would formalize donor collaboration in
the agricultural sector by establishing a donors group of representatives resident in Nepal. The
current forum, which involves periodic meetings hosted alternately by ADB and USAID
representatives, would be supported through more active Bank participation. The Joint Secretary,
Planning, MOA will take the lead and prepare a summary of activities relevant to the project in
collaboration with other donors and schedule regular meetings to share implementation
experiences and discuss future plans to support the agricultural sector.
Project Coordination
4.12 The government has established a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the Ministry of
Agriculture to coordinate implementation of the project. The government has also appointed a
senior official (a Class I Officer) with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank to
head the unit. The Project Coordinator has full authority to sanction expenditures approved for
PCU, DOA, and NARC. Other senior PCU staff would include two Assistant Agricultural
Development Officers, an Accounts Officer (a Class 3 officer), two non-gazetted accountants,
two Assistant Engineers, one seconded Project Officer from NARC and one from DOA, and
general administrative/office staff.
4.13 The PCU would prepare all documentation needed by the Steering Committee and
Technical Advisory Subcommittee, including consolidation of accounts, progress reports, work
programs, and budgets. The Unit would assist implementing agencies and districts with
procurement and contracting activities, and it would submit documentation to the Bank as
required. Terms of reference for the PCU are presented in Annex.4

Implementation of Agricultural Research Component
4.14 NARC would be responsible for implementing this component. It would:
(a)   streamline its organization and management as described in paras. 4.5 and 4.6;
(b)    develop its human capital and cooperate with other national and international
agricultural research institutions to train its staff in (i) integrated pest
management, (ii) farming systems, (iii) agricultural economics, (iv)
biotechnology, (v) agronomy, and (vi) soil science;
(c)   recruit research management consultants to assist in the organization and
management of research;
(d)    develop a demand driven agricultural research program to cover: (i) commodity
research for rice, wheat, potatoes, legumes, vegetables, citrus, small ruminants
and forage crops; (ii) regional research for adaptive farmer participatory
research; and (iii) thrust area research for sustainable production systems.
4.15  More details on implementation of the research component are presented in the
Implementation Volume of the Project Appraisal Document.
Implementation of Extension service Component
4.16 The Department of Agriculture would be responsible for overseeing implementation of this
component. It would:
(a)   streamline the organization and management of a decentralized extension service
as described in paras. 4.5 and 4.6;
(b)    develop its human capital and collaborate with local NGOs, by (i) improving the
methodology for identifying staff training needs, (ii) providing field staff with
higher level training and education; and (iii) involving local NGOs in identifying
farmers to be trained based on the needs and level of the farming community;
(c)   involve the private sector to provide extension service on a pilot scale in two-
three hill districts producing high value crops (fruits and vegetables); and
(d)   recruit extension management and farming systems consultants to assist in
the organization and management of the decentralized extension service.
4.17 Terms of reference for consultants to strengthen implementation of the extension service
component are presented in Annexes 5-8. However, more details on implementation of this
component are in the Implementation Volume of the Project Appraisal Document.

Research and Extension Linkages.
4.18 DOA and NARC would: (a) strengthen their institutional linkages at all levels, for example
through annual workshops with the participation of NGOs, (b) reinforce the linkages between the
Regional Agriculture Development Office and the Regional Research Stations through joint
identification of constraints to increased agricultural productivity and implementation of annual
adaptive research programs, (c) institutionalize joint planning and monitoring of annual
demonstrations and outreach programs, and (d) ensure that both research and extension prepare
and publish annual inventories of research results for dissemination to farmers. See diagram for
details (Annex 10).
Programming and Budgeting
4.19 The project would adopt a bottom-up approach for planning research and extension
activities. Farmers would identify their problems in collaboration with extension agents of the
area, and local NGOs, with periodic participation of research scientists from the regional and
commodity research stations. After which the District Agricultural Implementation Committee
(DAIC) would prioritize and consolidate local farmers' technology needs and services in an
annual plan and budget by January 31 of each year.
4.20 The District Agricultural Development Officers (chairpersons of the DAICs) would present
district plans to their Regional Agricultural Development Officers for review and consolidation
before submission to PCU and DOA headquarters. The Project Coordinator would organize
meetings every February and March in each of the five regions to rationalize and reconcile the
plans and budgets.
4.21 By April 15 of each year the Project Coordinator would submit the consolidated plans and
budgets from DOA and NARC to the Technical Advisory Subcommittee for review and
comment before approval by the Steering Committee. After which the plans and budgets would
be submitted to MOA for review, consolidation and processing through normal Government
procedures, which include review by the National Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance
and approval by the parliament. The entire process is designed to be transparent.
Accounts and Audit
4.22 The Department of Agriculture will implement normal Government accounting and auditing
procedures, while NARC will apply its mercantile procedure as an independent institution. The
PCU would maintain separate accounts for DOA and NARC, perform separate audit reporting,
and maintain a separate ledger for DOA and NARC with respect to withdrawals from the Special
Account. The financial management arrangements would include (a) accounting based on Project
Charts of Accounts to group or classify expenditures by project components activities,
disbursement categories and sources of funds, and appropriate accounting standard and reporting
formats; (b) arrangements for recording monitorable physical and other indicators for
comparison with related costs; (c) procurement contract management information; and (d)
internal control arrangements to ensure proper segregation of duties, documented procedures for
authorizations, and levels of supervision. The financial staff under the project would be trained
to implement above accounting requirements.

Procurement
4.23  Under the project works consist of construction and rehabilitation of laboratories,
agricultural service centers, training halls, greenhouses, and sheds. Because these works are
small and scattered throughout the country and would be implemented throughout the five-year
project period, they would not attract foreign bidders. Where feasible they would be procured
using national competitive bidding; where national competitive bidding is not feasible force
account or local contracting would be used.
4.24 NARC would use national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures satisfactory to the
Association, for works valued at US$3.4 million in aggregate. It would group the works into
convenient packages of at least US$200,000 by research station. NARC and DOA would use Force
account or direct contracting with local contractors in the districts for all works valued at less than
US$200,000 (such as construction and repair of sheds and boundary walls and rehabilitation of
buildings) up to an aggregate value of US$2.0 million. Most of these works range between US$
10,000 and 50,000.
4.25 Goods consist of vehicles, machinery, tools, equipment, furniture, and other materials. The
aggregate value of goods under the project is US$5.0 million. Jointly NARC and DOA would
group goods into packages of at least US$200,000 to be procured according to international
competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank. They would use national competitive
bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank to procure small pieces of machinery, tools, equipment,
and furniture costing less than US$200,000 per package up to an aggregate value of US$1.0
million. Construction materials required for force account works costing less US$20,000 would be
procured according to national shopping procedures after comparing price quotations obtained from
several suppliers (usually at least three) up to an aggregate value of US$0.2 million. Materials for
agricultural development activities (seed, seedlings, fertilizer) with a total value of US$0.1 million
would be purchased under the project. Purchases of such small quantities costing less than
US$10,000 for use throughout the project area would be procured using direct purchase procedures
satisfactory to the Association.
4.26 Consultancies and training consist of implementation support (US$2.6 million) and capacity
building (US$8.5 million). NARC and DOA would contract Technical assistance on terms and
conditions set forth in the "Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers" dated January 1997. They would procure training using in-house procedures
satisfactory to the Association.
4.27 Incremental operating costs (US$7.7 million) consist of materials and labor required for
operation and maintenance of project vehicles, equipment and machinery, buildings and office
supplies, field trial expenditures, and incremental NGOs and staff benefits. NARC' and DOA
expenditures-for these items would be made using in-house financial and administrative procedures
satisfactory to the Association.
4.28 The Association will review contracts for works valued at US$200,000 or more, goods valued
at US$100,000 or more, consultancies valued at US$50,000 or more, and consultancies with
individuals valued at US$10,000 or more, prior to contracting. All single-source consultant
contracts and other contracts would be subject to selective post-review by visiting Bank missions.

4.31  The credit would be disbursed to cover expenditures on incremental operating costs
(including vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, office supplies, field trial
expenditures and incremental staff benefits and utilities) on a declining basis over time.
Disbursements would cover 75 percent of these expenditures until July 15, 1998; 50 percent until
July 15, 2000; and 25 percent thereafter.
4.32 The implementing agencies would provide full documentation for disbursements for
expenditures for vehicles, equipment, and fumiture under contracts exceeding US$100,000; for
works under contracts exceeding US$200,000; and for consultancies and training under contracts
exceeding US$50,000 (US$10,000 for individual consultants). IDA would disburse against
statements of expenditure presented in an agreed upon format for all other expenditures.
Implementing agencies would present supporting documents for statements of expenditure to the
Bank's supervision missions and auditors for inspection. These documents would be retained by
implementing agencies for one year after receipt by the Bank of audit report for the fiscal year in
which the last withdrawal from the credit account was made.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS OBJECTIVES SUPPORTED BY THE PROJECT: CAS Document Number 15508-NEP,
of April 30, 1996
5.1 The priority sectors for IDA involvement in CAS were selected on the basis of their
importance for poverty alleviation, growth, and natural resource management. In the agricultural
sector CAS has determined that agricultural technology and its dissemination play an important
role in alleviating rural poverty and generating economic growth in the agricultural sector.
5.2 Agricultural research is one of the priority investment areas in Nepal's Agricultural
Perspective Plan (APP), which gives highest priority to research and extension on staple crops
(rice, maize, wheat, potatoes, and pulses); high-value commodities (horticulture, vegetables,
livestock, apiculture, and sericulture); and natural resource management (soil fertility, integrated
pest management, and sustainable intensification of production systems). By supporting
agricultural research and extension the project would ultimately increase rural income and
improve the living standard of the rural poor.
5.3 This project is also consistent with the Bank's strategy for agriculture which supports the
involvement of beneficiaries in the design and implementation of rural development programs
for poverty reduction. In support of the strategy, the project would implement a decentralized
approach that ensures that both agricultural research and extension are relevant and responsive to
farmers' needs.
6. MAIN SECTOR ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
6.1 Main sector issues are: (a) the centralized planning process for research programs does not
adequately address farmers' problems at the grass-roots level; (b) the benefit reward system for
agricultural staff (promotion, salary increments and training, etc) discourages individual
initiative and hard work as these aspects are not recognized by supervisors; (c) agricultural
inputs (fertilizers and seed) supplied by the Agricultural Inputs Corporation are highly
subsidized which can not be sustained.



- 11 -
7. SECTOR ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT AND STRATEGIC CHOICES
7.1 The first two issues discussed above would be addressed by the project. The project would
support a decentralized bottom up planning process for research and extension activities. The
process would involve the participation of beneficiaries, local NGOs, extension and research
staff and the private sector in the identification of farmers problems and in the implementation of
research programs that address these problems. The collaborative process would also improve
the linkage between research and extension.
7.2 The research and extension staff would be motivated through training and a reward system
which recognizes initiative and hard work. Job descriptions for all field staff would be prepared
and their implementation monitored through feed-back from farmers.
7.3 Because the supply of agricultural inputs by the public sector is inadequate, in the short to
medium term NARC would concentrate on increased production of breeder seed and contract the
private sector for seed multiplication. The Department of Agriculture would also train a few
farmers in seed multiplication and provide them with initial capital for seed production.
8. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION
8.1 The project proposed by the government was country wide, including districts which lacked
the appropriate environment for agricultural growth. It was based on a top-down process for
developing research recommendations that did not reflect farmers' concerns. Additionally, the
proposal lacked plans to improve linkages between research and extension services which are
crucial to the success of the project.

10. LESSONS LEARNED AND REFLECTED IN THE PROJECT DESIGN
10.1 Lack of Responsiveness and Relevance to Farmers' Needs. The farmers group approach
to extension introduced in the later part of AEP II implementation as a pilot exercise has
significant advantages over other extension systems used in Nepal. The approach: (a) addresses
farmers needs, (b) provides for wider coverage of extension contact with farmers at lower cost
(therefore cost effective), and (c) provides greater direct interaction between technicians and
SMSs and farmers. Because of these advantages, the government would implement the group
approach throughout the project area and re-orient the research system toward solving farmers'
problems. The project would ensure through intensive supervision that farmers' problems are
identified by farmers themselves with the assistance of local NGOs and technical guidance is
provided by extension agents and research scientists. The project would emphasize farmer
participatory research and on-farm verification of technology.
10.2 Poor Staff Quality. The project would up-grade NARC and DOA staff through training
both locally and to neighboring countries. The training program would be tailored to meet
farmers' needs.
10.3 Inadequate Linkages between Research and Extension. The project would support
Regional Working Groups that would prioritize the research proposals submitted by Regional
Directors of Agriculture, DADOs, and ASCs. Farmers and NGOs would be involved in the
selection of members of the Regional Working Groups, to ensure equal representation of
research and extension staff. The main objective would be to ensure that selected proposals for
finding represent farmers needs identified at the local level.
10.4 Extension Agents' Lack Motivation. The training provided to extension staff was irrelevant
to farmers' needs because trainers and trainees were not motivated. DOA would prepare a
strategy which introduces incentives to motivate field staff. This is one of the dated covenants in
the Development Credit Agreement.
10.5 Weak Management. The project would help enhance the management capacity of NARC
and DOA by introducing management information systems for personnel, finance, and program
implementation.
11. INDICATORS OF BORROWER COMMITMENT AND OWNERSHIP
11.1 The Government is conscious of the problems constraining agricultural growth in general
and agricultural research and extension in particular. Actions taken recently demonstrate the
Government's strong commitment and ownership of the project. The govemment has:
a) Reorganized MOA based on the concept of decentralization in planning and design
of an agricultural development program. The reorganization would strengthen the
activities of grassroots level institutions (ASCs and farmer groups). The new
approach would maximize farmer participation in planning and designing of
community-based development activities.
b) Established NARC as an autonomous agency with powers to guide and coordinate
all research activities in the country (1992) to prepare a strategic plan, which



-14-
establishes priorities for agricultural research, and discusses the plan with the all
donors supporting the agricultural sector.
c) Approved an Agricultural Perspective Plan (1995) that highlights the strategic focus
and a prioritized productivity package that is essential for holistic and sustainable
development of the agriculture and rural sector.
d) Adopted a National Agricultural Extension Strategy and an action plan for its
implementation through a three-day workshop attended by key agricultural policy-
making personnel, donors, and farmer representatives from each region (1994).
e) Organized a one-day workshop to discuss outstanding issues and agree on the overall
concept of the project and on specific project design considerations (late July 1996).
f) Caused NARC to strengthen links with national and international research centers,
for example by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research to cooperate on agricultural technical matters. Selected
CGIAR centers have also been invited to participate in NARC's research program.
11.2 In November 1996 the Govemment (a) prepared an implementation plan for the project; (b)
established a Steering Committee that includes the membership recommended by the Bank; (c)
accepted the reduced scope of the project; and (d) established a Technical Advisory Sub-
Committee to be headed by a non-government official in consultation with the Bank. The
Government has also prepared the annual work plan and budget for the activities of the project to
be implemented during the first year, and it has prepared bidding documents for about 25 percent
of procurement under the project. These commitments establish ideal conditions for successful
implementation of the project and indicate that the Government is serious about improving the
economic welfare of the rural poor.
12. VALUE ADDED OF BANK SUPPORT
12.1 Aid Coordination. The Bank has been involved with the government for the past 24 years
as a leading donor in supporting the agricultural sector. With this relationship the Bank would
provide the government the opportunity to consolidate the disparate approaches of donors in
research and extension and strengthen its conceptual and implementation capacity.
12.2 International Experience. The Bank has extensive international experience with research
and extension projects. It has access to international research centers which would provide
support to Nepal through the project.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessment
13. ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT
[X] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$73 million; ERR=5 1 percent.
Project Costs
13.1 Total project costs are estimated at US$30.5 million, including contingencies equivalent to
US$5.0 million. IDA would provide US$24.3 million (SDR17.5 million) and His Majesty's
Government of Nepal would provide US$6.2 million. Of the total project cost, US$22.8 million
would be for investment and US$7.7 million would be for incremental recurrent costs. Duties
and taxes are equivalent to US$3.5 million. These costs are based on 1996 prices and include
physical contingencies of 5-15 percent. Actual price contingencies are based on projected
domestic inflation rates for local costs and projected foreign inflation for foreign costs over the
project implementation period of five years.
Retroactive Financing and Special Account
13.2 To expedite project start-up, IDA would retroactively finance project expenditures incurred
between March 1997 (after appraisal) and credit signing (within 12 months) up to a limit of SDR
1.44 million (US$2.0 million equivalent), provided IDA procurement procedures and guidelines are
followed. These expenditures would include limited procurement of vehicles and equipment,
consultant services and workshops for training, and other start-up activities. To facilitate timely
payment of project expenditures, a special account holding the equivalent of US$1.5 million (equal
to three months' average disbursements) would be established at the Nepal Central Bank.
Project Benefits
13.3 The Project is designed to dovetail with the overall objectives of the APP and provide a
substantial input in terms of new agricultural technologies which, along with irrigation, fertilizer,
and roads and rural electrification, are the driving forces behind the APP strategy that will
increase farmer income and rural employment.
13.4 The new interventions from research, disseminated through extension, will also increase the
yields and production of high-valued crops, citrus, and livestock which are also key elements of
the APP strategy. The Project develops technologies to be used across all three main regions of
the Terai, Hills and Mountain regions. Furthermore, since a major source of income for farm
women, many of which are poor, is from high value crops and livestock, the interventions form
the Project combined with the APP strategy will increase their productivity and enhance the
welfare of women.
13.5 Benefits will accrue to the agricultural research and extension systems from the project.
First, the project resources are earmarked and Project funds distributed in such a way as to
encourage the decentralization of both the research system and the extension system. This allows
more authority over budgets and expenditures by scientists in regional research institutions, on-
farm (outreach) research programs, and by the RADO's and DADO's in extension. The project
also encourages the institutionalization of the design, evaluation, and dissemination of
technologies by creating a stronger interface and institutional linkages between component
researchers from the research stations, those doing on-farm (outreach) research, and extension
(farmer groups). This allows for a more bottom-up approach to identifying research priorities



-16-
and organizing yearly programs and budgets for both the research and extension systems. The
Project will also contribute to further developing a critical mass of research scientists through
training and through international research contacts. The introduction of a competitive research
grants system will focus research and make the research system more competitive.
13.6 The immediate beneficiaries are farmers although the country will benefit from more
employment in rural areas and from the growth in the gross domestic product though multiplier
effects. The yield and production of the main crops of rice, maize, wheat and potatoes will be
substantially increased especially in conjunction with the full implementation of the APP.
Economic Analysis
13.7 The expected returns from research on rice, maize, and wheat were estimated using an ex-
ante economic surplus model over a time horizon of 15 years. Included in the wheat estimates
are the returns from the research thrust on the rice/wheat cropping sequence.
13.8 The three commodities account for 85% of the total cropped land, 93% of all cereal
production, and rice alone accounts for one-fourth of the gross domestic product. In terms of
research investment, about 50% of the total Research and Extension Project funds are devoted to
direct and indirect research expenditures on the three commodities. The returns on the three
commodities are indicative of the returns that may be expected from remaining Project
investments in research.
13.9 Two rate of return scenarios were employed. Scenario 1, assumes that the project would be
fully implemented but the remaining part of the APP would not be implemented (no increase in
irrigation, roads and electricity, or fertilizer levels as foreseen under APP), whereas scenario 2,
assumes the project would be fully implemented but the APP would be partially implemented.
Partial APP implementation means irrigation investments and policies are delayed by five years
and increments in fertilizer levels reduced by 80% and 70% of expected fertilizer levels in the
second and third five year periods of the APP respectively.
13.10 For scenario 1, the net present value of benefits (NPVB) and the economic rate of return
(ERR) were estimated to be NRs 4,029 million and 51% respectively when the benefits and
expenditures for rice, maize and wheat are taken as a group. Individually, rice, maize and wheat
NPVBs were estimated to be NRs 2,619, NRs 964, and NRs 446 million with a corresponding
ERR of 68%, 56% and 27% respectively.
13.11 For scenario 2, the NPVB and ERR were estimated to be NRs 7,762 million and 70%
respectively when the benefits and expenditures for rice, maize and wheat are grouped.
Individually, rice, maize and wheat NPVBs were estimated to be NRs 4,739, NRs 2,089, and
NRs 934 million with a corresponding ERR of 94%, 80% and 36% respectively.
13.12 Project economic costs have been derived from detailed cost tables (attached), excluding
taxes and price contingencies. After the implementation period, recurrent costs were maintained
at a constant level for the economic life of the project. On-farm production costs were derived
from crop budgets for 1994 provided by the Department of Agriculture, with minor adjustments.
All local costs including labor costs have been converted to border values by using a standard
conversion factor of 0.9 for Nepal.



- 17-
13.13 Because Nepal is a food deficit country, incremental production would be consumed on
the farm or marketed locally. In the process, the incremental production of rice, wheat and maize
would act as a substitute for imports. The economic prices for these crops were derived from the
latest World Bank Commodity Price Projections issued in February 1997. The prices were
adjusted for port handling at Calcutta (India) and local transportation to the Nepal boarder to
determine their import parity levels.
Sensitivity Analysis
13.14 A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on selected parameters. The base model results are
not overly sensitive to moderate changes in supply elasticity, commodity prices, or an increase in
research expenditures and the returns remained robust. Scenario I has been assumed to be the
most likely out-come under the project, giving a rate of return of 50 percent.
13.15 The rates of return under the two scenarios are robust and in line with similar research
investments in other countries indicating that agricultural research, and the research from the
project in particular, is a good investment. Under scenario 1 estimates, the NPVB from research
on rice alone is 2.5 times that of the net present value of the expenditures for the entire project.
Details on economic analysis are presented in Annex 9.
Poverty Alleviation
13.16 The Project would ultimately help to increase the productivity and production of a wide
range of crops and livestock. The increase would mainly be in the dominant food crops of rice,
maize, wheat and potatoes which are important to the welfare of small farmers, many of whom
are poor. The marketable surplus crops derive much of the farmers' outside income. These crops
are also the main food of most of the rural and urban poor. Any increase in production of these
crops would contribute substantially to food security. Additionally, the increased agricultural
productivity and production, through research interventions would increase employment for the
rural and urban poor.
Fiscal Impact
13.17 The actual expenditure on research and extension in the project area for FY96 and
estimates for FY97 was NRs 123.7 million and NRs 164.2 million respectively. These
expenditures exclude external donor financing.
13.18 Under the proposed project, the government plans to spend NRs. 495.0 million during
FY98. Of this amount IDA would provide NRs.357.3 million and HMGN NRs. 137.7 million.
Thereafter, the government's counterpart contribution to the project would be about NRs 64
million annually against average IDA disbursements of NRs 306 million. This amount is below
the estimated annual expenditure in the project area. As such no incremental funds in the
government budget above current levels would be required.
14. FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT
14.1 The financial rate of return is not applicable to this project. However, the project would
improve the financial viability of farming enterprises through increased annual net returns to
farm labor and capital investment. As a result, the disposable incomes of farmers participating



- 18 -
in the project would increase, enabling them to invest in the education and health of their
children and to acquire fixed assets in the long run. These results are based on farm budgets
prepared using current farming systems, with increased crop yields derived from the
development of relevant technology through the project. Farm incomes are estimated to increase
from NRs24,700 to NRs 28,950 per household at full project development.
15. TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT
15.1 The main thrust of the project is to develop and disseminate technology that would raise
farmers' incomes and meet the country's longer-term food and export needs. Given the low farm
productivity throughout Nepal, distribution of improved seed varieties, albeit in limited
quantities, and dissemination of inter-cropping technology for short season cash crops, including
technology for high-value vegetable production, could significantly improve agricultural output
over the next five years. Applicable technology is available from research institutions in Nepal
and India, from some NGOs, and from the IARCs.
15.2 In the longer term a stronger research and extension capacity will have to be developed in
order to resolve issues of environmental sustainability and marketing associated with agricultural
intensification. Accordingly, the project has been designed to strengthen the capacity for
adaptive research and collaboration with bilateral research centers and IARCs in order to take
advantage of the relevant technology and know-how available abroad. The project would also
seek to move research and extension away from the current commodity/discipline approach
toward a more holistic "production systems" approach. The focus would therefore be on
introducing integrated pest management, beginning with the rapidly emerging production of
vegetables, and intensifying production in the rice-wheat cropping system, which accounts for 80
percent of agriculture production in the country, in a sustainable manner.
16. INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT
Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC)
16.1 NARC's current structure is complex and difficult to coordinate its activities, and its output
is not always responsive to the location-specific needs of farmers. Disciplinary research
divisions are poorly organized. Each regional research station concentrates on commodity
research rather than the more relevant farmer problems, and coordination with other regional
stations is weak. The project would consolidate NARC centers, transforming them into smaller,
more dynamic organizations that respond to farmers' needs by developing relevant agricultural
technology.
16.2 NARC currently employs 1,700 people, most of whom are poorly motivated and under
qualified to do research. The project would upgrade staff through training and introduce a
reward system that recognizes individual performance and output and links rewards to adoption
of technology in the extension worker's area of operation. Senior staff performance reviews
would be based on achievement of program objectives.
16.3 NARC's autonomous status which has been reinforced by the amendment of its Act in
1997, would allow project implementation to be monitored closely. NARC's success would be
measured in termns of increases in productivity and farm incomes generated by adoption of its
technology rather than by the traditional measures of inputs and outputs. The benchmarks



-19-
established by the study commissioned by USAID could be used to measure NARC's
performance. The USAID benchmark review would provide an indication of NARC's
administrative effectiveness and would help stakeholders determine how effective and
sustainable NARC is as a key institution for technology generation.
16.4 The organizational performance evaluation system consists of five clusters, each of which
leads to the next, with feedback mechanisms based on critical agreed upon management
standards. The five clusters include (a) human resources (personnel), funds, infrastructure,
research strategy, and goals; (b) research operations (research, testing/adaptation, reporting, and
dissemination); (c) output (knowledge, procedure, improved technology, and publications); (d)
users (planners, consumers/producers, academics, the community, and other stakeholders); and
(e) outcomes (increased production, cost reduction, profit, and achievement of objectives).
16.5 The project includes a periodic organization assessment of policies and goals, strategy,
research programs and staff quality, research and extension linkages, protection of public assets,
and information flow (M&E systems, periodic external reviews, MIS, internal and external
reporting, and so forth).
Department ofAgriculture (DOA)
16.6 Although overall responsibility for implementing the extension component lies with DOA,
day-to-day decisions would remain with the district administration. The district administration,
village development committees and NGOs would assume a major role in disseminating
technology to farmers. The field extension staff would serve as facilitators of technology
transfer. To support implementation of a decentralized extension service, more than 60 percent
of its expenditure would be at the grassroots level.
16.7 The project would train extension workers, farmers group leaders and local NGOs to
enhance their capacity to provide farmers with relevant advice. Some sub-centers would be
upgraded to ASCs, and others would be converted to residential quarters to relieve field staff
with the problem of inadequate housing. Such an arrangement would motivate extension workers
to take up postings in remote areas.
16.8 The role of local institutions would change under the project. For the first time, village
development committees, local NGOs and farmers groups would be given the opportunity to be
actively involved in the design and implementation of project activities. The project would
facilitate the participatory approach by providing resources (working capital) to teams of experts
from research and extension service, and local NGOs and farmers groups to work together. The
PCU would monitor the participatory approach closely using the performance indicators in
Annex 1.
Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
16.9 Because the PCU is new, its staff would be trained and provided with appropriate tools to
function. This would involve the introduction of a computerized management information
system, to assist PCU staff to analyze and consolidate data and information from districts and
NARC participating in the project. The use of MIS would facilitate monitoring of
implementation progress and record keeping. The monitoring and evaluation process would
include assessment of community participation, human resource development and training,
preparation of annual plans and budgets, and procurement and it would assess the social and
economic impact of the project on participating districts.



- 20 -
17. SOCIAL ASSESSMENT
17.1 There is a gender imbalance in the decision making process in research and extension
service set-up. To address the issue, the project would assist the Women Farmers Development
Division in the MOA (WFDD) enhance the recruitment and training of extension staff. Women
farner groups would be given equal opportunity for training and in the decision-making process
to choose activities of their interest. The project would also support WFDD to develop a
women's sensitization program and develop performance indicators to assess its achievements.
At the national level the project would support WFDD to provide special gender-related training
in agricultural and rural development to its staff. To achieve this, a gender specialist would be
recruited to assist WFDD design and implement its activities
17.2 Because project benefits ultimately would be shared by all participating farmers, it would
not be necessary to provide special treatment for disadvantaged groups at the village level.
However, DOA would be required to give these groups special consideration in the recruiting
and upgrading extension workers. The PCU would monitor implementation of the Government's
plans for disadvantaged groups and bring to the Government's attention cases of neglect.
18. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Environmental Category (C)
18.1 The project would have a positive impact on the environment:
a) The focus given to IPM research would help farmers reduce the use of herbicides and
insecticides in their farning systems.
b) Research on water management, soil fertility, and integrated nutrient management would
provide interventions with which to combat soil degradation and ground water
contamination.
c) Interventions to increase crop diversification, particularly into legume crops, would increase
soil fertility, thereby decreasing the need for chemical fertilizers.
d) Interventions to increase the use of low-cost quality feeds for small ruminants would reduce
dependency on shrubs and trees for feed and would have a positive effect on the
environment.
e) Much of the increase in productivity would come from introduction of improved seed and its
multiplication and dissemination to farmers, which in most cases has a neutral effect on the
environment.
f) By contributing to the sustainability and increased productivity of the farming systems, the
project interventions would reduce the immediate pressure to develop new lands and water
resources in all regions, particularly in the Hill regions, where soil degradation and water
problems could become acute.

20. SUSTAINABILITY
20.1 The proposed participatory approach would increase the sense of ownership in the project.
Involving farmers groups, research scientists, and extension workers in identifying constraints
and finding solutions to local problems would help ensure the relevancy of research. Giving
more accountability to grassroots institutions, including NGOs, would enhance the efficiency of
resource use.
20.2 For example contracting out research activities where necessary and privatizing extension
services on a pilot scale as has been done in Nepal (No Frills and New Era) and in Estonia and
elsewhere, increases the likelihood of minimizing costs. The close monitoring of implementation
ensures that project activities by beneficiaries would be sustainable and that public resources will
be efficiently used. Savings would also accrue from the project's emphasis on low-input
technology in the short to medium term, which would reduce the use of chemical fertilizer.
These savings could be used to improve agricultural advisory services in Nepal.

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
GENDER SPECIALIST IN AGRICULTURE
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Objectives
1.    The consultant would assist the Women Farmers Development Division (WFDD) of the
Ministry of agriculture (MOA) to:
(i)    design research and extension activities and methods appropriate for women
farmers and for women groups;
(ii)   develop strategies for integrating a proper gender perspective into agricultural
research and extension activities at all levels; and
(iii) design a training curriculum and instruction program to sensitize male extension
agents on gender perspectives in agriculture, and monitor their implementation
effectiveness.
Purpose and Methodology
2.    In Nepal, about 96 percent of women live in rural areas, and 94 percent are engaged in
agriculture. The role of women is important in both farming activities and in farm decision
making. A strong male bias pervades, however, the effect of which is compounded by socio-
cultural taboos. Both agricultural research and extension are mostly geared toward male farmers.
Thus, messages tend to focus on the activities of male farmers rather on the wide range of
agricultural responsibilities of women. The result is a highly inefficient use of resources and a
negative impact on agricultural production altogether.
3.    To promote women's activities in the rural areas, WFDD was established in 1992 under
the MOA with the mandate to formulate short and medium-term strategies for incorporating
gender dimensions into agricultural development policies, programs and projects. So far, WFDD
has been constrained by lack of experience in planning and in designing a global program due to
insufficient trained personnel to deal with gender issues.
4.    The work will be carried out in close cooperation with MOA, WFDD and the Institute of
Agriculture and Animal Sciences (IAAS) faculty in Agricultural Extension and Rural Sociology.
The assignment will commence with field visits to the Hills and the Terai districts to assess
women's role in and contribution to agriculture. Assessments will also be made of the nature and
of the extent of NARC and DOA incorporation of research and extension studies on and
activities for women farmer groups into their respective programs.



-32 -
Assignment Topics
5.    Based on background information obtained from field visits, and from discussions with
WFDD and IAAS personnel, the consultant will:
(i)      identify the areas where women need support as they face particular constraints
in terms of access to resources and to information;
(ii)   define the main factors that contribute to the formation of women
farmers groups, their operation and function, using the problem census/problem
solving as well as the rapid rural appraisal approaches to ensure the women's
participation in design and evaluation;
(iii)   examine the information needed to adjust extension to better reach
women farmers, to modify the focus of research to address women's specific
activities and constraints, and to properly monitor and evaluate women's
programs;
(iv)   make recommendations as to an integrated but flexible extension system
for all farmers including women farmers, and define ways to deliver extension
services to women to overcome their constraints of time, mobility, and lower
education level;
(v)   identify women farmers training needs, priorities, type of training,
duration, and training venues;
(vi)   suggest the best ways of ensuring lateral exchange of information among
women's groups and villages;
(vii)  define WFDD  personnel's short and medium-term  training needs
including pre-and in-service training to enable male extension agents to work
effectively with women farmers, and M.Sc courses on gender perspectives in
agriculture;
(viii)  design gender sensitivity training for extension workers, project staff,
community leaders, and for decision makers;
(ix)   indicate whether and how to use the mass-media to transfer messages to
women farmners;
(x)    suggest ways for women farmers to generate agricultural and non-
agricultural income; and
(xi)  train her assigned local counterparts in accordance with a detailed
training program prepared in liaison with WFDD and IAAS; and



- 33 -
Nature, Timing and Length of Assignment
6.    The international Gender Specialist will be recruited for a total period of five months,
split into two months each in year 1 and 2, and one month in year 3. The consultant will work
closely with WFDD personnel at the center, a local gender specialist engaged for 20 person
months over the project first four years, and with five WFDD Regional Subject Matter
Specialists for women in agriculture. The consultant will also work closely with the Extension
Management Specialist, the Agricultural Communication Specialist, and the local Extension
Management and Training consultants.
Training of Counterparts
7.    The consultant will finalize with WFDD, and submit to MOA, a training program for her
local Gender Specialist and for the 5 regional SMS for women in agriculture by the end of her
first two months stay in Nepal. Both WFDD and MOA will prepare relevant key indicators for
the proper monitoring and evaluation of the local counterparts training program.
Reporting
8.    The consultant will submit a progress report at the end of each stay. The report will
highlight the progress, the difficulties and the constraints encountered. It will also detail the
status of the counterparts training program as against initially defined targets.
Qualification and Experience
9.    The candidate should have agricultural sciences, rural sociology and gender analysis
background with preferably a post-graduate degree in one of these areas. The consultant should
have a broad range of international experience and some exposure to cases in Asia. Finally, the
candidate must be fluent in English and have proven teaching skills.

Annex 6
NEPAL
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Objectives
1.       The consultant will assist the Ministry of agriculture (MOA) strengthen the
Agricultural Communication Division (ACD) at the center, and establishing effective
Agricultural Communication Units at the regional levels for design and use of appropriate
media. To that end the Agricultural Communications Specialist will need to:
(i)   recommend the most suitable communication technologies for use in Nepal's
agricultural research and extension programs; and
(ii)   develop and present training courses for ACD at the center, the regions (RADO) and
IAAS staff in the use of communication strategies, media, and technics, paying
particular attention to the design of media to meet the needs of specific audiences.
Purpose and Methodology
2.       To date ACD has concentrated on producing a successful radio program for farmers.
It also produces print media. There is, however, little or no linkage and coordination with other
agencies involved in the transfer of knowledge and training. There is no audience awareness
either in terms of what farmers want as information, or how print material should be presented
for farmers to understand. There is no evaluation as to the impact of agricultural communications
on farmers knowledge and on their income. Last but not least, extension takes little to no
advantage of this formidable tool.
3.    Despite the above weaknesses, the use of communications has considerable potential in
Nepal, especially in the Hills where many farmer households are still of difficult access. Finally,
radio is by far the most cost/effective means for transferring knowledge.
Assignment Topics
4.    Based on the background information obtained from field visits, and from, discussions
with communication specialists, the consultant will:
(i)    design the necessary awareness campaigns and impact evaluation surveys in
order to better target and adjust current radio programs and print media;
(ii)   prepare a communication strategy, prioritize themes and topics, categorize
farmers including women and youth, taking into account designs, methods, materials and
technologies;



- 35 -
(iii)  define with NARC, MOA, IAAS and the end users, the type of communication
media appropriate per category of farmers, as well as for the extension agents;
(iv)   establish with IAAS a training module for extension personnel aimed at teaching
how to become an active communicator, and when to make the best use of mass-media
and of print material to complement extension visits;
(v)    ensure through proper venues the lateral exchange of information among farmer
groups and villages;
(vi)   devise the organization and management of multi-level, multi-dimensional
agricultural development communication system that is responsive to farmer groups
information needs;
(vii)  prepare together with IAAS training programs for JT/JTAs to become better
communicators, for farmer indigenous specialists to become active communicators
within farmers groups and village development committees, for faculty members in how
to communicate effectively with the farming community, and for communication units
on how to produce video, films and print media to raise levels of awareness,
understanding, and support for the ATDP goals, and objectives.
Nature, Timing and Length of Assignment
5.    The international consultant in Agricultural Communication would be hired for a total
period of three months spread over the first two years of the project (one month in year 1 and
two months in year 2). A local communication specialist would be employed for six months
distributed over the first two years. The consultants would work as a team to articulate a
nationwide system for agricultural development communication, design strategies, and identify
message-media packages for production, and conduct a training course for the communication
specialists on communication strategies and technology.
Training of Counterparts
6.       Because of the overall short stay of the consultant in Nepal, the training of the local
counterparts will be rather limited. Thus, the priority will be on the various types of media to
consider given the diversity of the farmers, of their environment, and of their level of
understanding. The producing of video-films and of print media would be treated as an option in
the training program, knowing that these aspects can easily be learned in neighboring India. By
the end of the first stay in Nepal, the consultant should have finalized the counterparts training
program and set the key indicators needed to evaluate future progress.
Reporting
7.       The consultant will produce a short progress report at the end of the first month in the
country. A more thorough report will be prepared at the end of the second and last stay in Nepal.
The latter report will be essentially the set of recommendations and of proposals made by the
consultant in order to strengthen ACD at both the center, and in the regions.



- 36 -
Qualification and Experience
8.       The international consultant should have agricultural sciences, rural sociology and
communication background with preferably a post-graduate degree in rural sociology. The
candidate should have strong international standard and a record of development communication
program and institution building in developing countries, preferably in South Asia. The
candidate must be fluent in spoken and in written English, and have proven teaching skills.

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
EXTENSION MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1. Objectives
The consultant would have a key role helping MOA/DOA conceptualize the country's
current agricultural extension system so that it be based on a farmer-centered Group Approach.
The consultant would therefore:
(i) assist MOA/DOA in restructuring its extension system and management of the
extension service based on bottom-up and demand driven farmer-centered group
approach using all necessary techniques including PC/PS and RRA;
(ii) help promote a participatory approach whereby farmers, including women and
youth, are encouraged to give their views on what they expect from extension, how they
would like it to operate, and, how they could eventually contribute (given extension's
current limitations);
(iii) develop a management system in extension from the field to the central level which
ensures that planning and implementation reflect farmer groups particular problems and
constraints;
(iv) review the training courses for trainers responsible for mobilizing and teaching
farmer groups the PC/PS and RRA approaches to agricultural development;
(v) liaise with IAAS in developing curriculum and materials for the teaching to the
extension staff the purpose and methodology of participatory approach to community
resource development and planning;
(vi) provide advice and assistance in the training of trainers at central, regional and
district levels; and
(vii) assist MOA/DOA further develop a national strategy for extension that gives
increasing responsibilities to farmers, associates other partners already providing
knowledge transfer to the rural community, anticipates a gradual divesting over the long
term of the public sector from as many support services to agriculture possible, and
defines a new role for the Government.
2.    Purpose and Methodology
Agriculture extension in Nepal has essentially been based on a top-down technology
transfer approach over the past three decades. Numerous extension systems and approaches have



-38 -
been tested and/or implemented, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. The T&V
system was the most widespread system in the late 70s. It is estimated that by 1991, technology
dissemination to farmers through that system was reaching an average 5 to 10 percent of the total
rural population through interpersonal contacts between extension workers and contact farmers.
Subsequently, however, and due to financial constraints HMGN adopted a decentralized farmer
groups approach to render extension more cost-effective.
The challenge to the MOA is to make extension available to all farmers, in one form or
the other, while remaining within a budget the country can afford over time. In view of Nepal's
rapidly evolving agriculture on one hand, and given the national and local budgetary constraints
on the other, extension now needs to rely on the quality of its agents not on their sheer numbers.
Also, a more systematic use of the mass-media would be made.
The consultant would work in association with the local extension management and
training specialists of each region and in cooperation with IAAS. Cooperation would also be
sought from DOA's central, regional and districts levels. The consultant will interview extension
personnel having implemented the PC/PS approach, farmers involved, and analyze reports.
3.    Assignment Topics
Models would be designed within a regional context to make the best use of existing
personnel, while relying on other partners when available, on other means of knowledge transfer
and, on possible contributions by farmers. Extension cannot reach all farmers on a one-on-one
basis nationwide, nor should it. Thus the proportion of farmers that would be reached through
groups and during a given period of time would be defined. The extension specialist will
therefore be asked to:
(a)    define the main categories of farmers and their various sources for
advice;
(b)    carry out an inventory of the various types of groups formed so far and
analyze the reasons for their success and/or for failure;
(c)   review the other partners involved in the transfer of knowledge, the way
they are organized, how they operate and, at what estimated costs;
(d)    determine possible areas of duplication, of complementarity and, of
comparative advantage;
(e)    propose flexible approaches to extension using farmer groups and other means,
that derive from interviews with farmers, researchers, scholars, representatives
of NGOs and, the private sector;
(f)   review and/or define clear, updated terms of reference and profiles for all the
categories of extension agents;
(g)    provide - together with the human resource specialist - guidance as to the
extension agents and the farmers training requirements.



- 39 -
(h)    review the current links with the local research networks and devise simple
mechanisms to ensure such links;
(i)    make proposals for the complementary increase use of audio-visual aids,
including radio and television broadcasts and other means that suit users'
comprehension levels; and
(j)    anticipate how extension is likely to evolve within the next five to ten years and
work out the corresponding budgets;
4.    Nature, Timing and Length of Assignment
The international Extension Management Expert will be recruited for a total of 16
months as follows during the project period: 4 months each in the project's first four years. Local

will start at the end of the consultant's third month with the Project.
6.    Reporting
The consultant will submit regular progress reports at the end of each of his/her stay in
the country. Theses reports will highlight the progress made in the assignment as well as the
status of the training of the counterparts. The consultant will finalize an Operational Guidelines
on the approach to extension based on farmer groups, the widening of the knowledge
dissemination process using mass media, and the resorting to other partners including NGOs and
the private sector.

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
FARMING SYSTEMS CONSULTANT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Objectives
I.    The consultant would assist and train research staff in design and implementation of on-
farm research trials in cooperation with extension personnel and farmers for evolving location
specific technology recommendations for farmer groups. He will therefore make proposals to:
(I)   improve the current farming systems approach and methodology;
(ii)   strengthen and expand the outreach research program with farming
systems perspectives;
(iii)   promote farmer-centered technology development programs specific
to the various ecological zones; and
(iv)   establish institutional linkages between research, extension and
higher education.
Purpose and Methodology
2.    Farming systems in Nepal, especially in the Hills, are complex, dynamic systems which evolve
in response to agro-climatic, ecological, technological, socio-economic and, political conditions. No least
important, the farming systems need increasingly to adopt certain principles of agricultural sustainability.
3.    The current links between research and extension are weak. Also, research tends to be
compartmentalized between agriculture and livestock as well as between the farmers various activities.
This is adversely affecting the relevance and the effectiveness of the technology being transferred to
farming communities.
4.    While the farming system approach will emphasize close interaction of the various agronomic
and livestock subsystems typifying both subsistence and commercial farm operations, research will need
to be shaped by community consultation. This would ensure that farmers obtain recommendations that
are relevant to their activities and truly address their priority problems and constraints in a holistic
perspective.
5.    The work will be carried out together with the proposed outreach director of NARC and the
stations directors. The key approach will be to take stock of the experiences and successes of outreach
programs supported by the ARETP. The end results should lead to: (i) the developing of relevant
technology through research; (ii) the disseminating of appropriate technology and managerial
improvements through extension; (iii) the developing of relevant policies to encourage production and
sustainability; and (iv) the implementing of appropriate support systems for farm-households.

Assignment Topics
6.     The consultant, in association with the NARC project coordinator and the outreach
director, will:
(I)    advise and assist the outreach research director in formulating,
prioritizing, coordinating and supervising integrated outreach programs
based on farming system perspectives at regional, district and local
levels, both in the Terai and in the Hills, in collaboration with
DOA/DLS and IAAS;
(ii)   advise and assist the director, coordinators of outreach research and
station/center chiefs on the determination of appropriate allocation of
resources to the outreach priority research programs;
(iii)   advise and assist the chiefs/coordinators of NARC operational units in
monitoring, reviewing and in evaluating ongoing and completed outreach
research programs;
(iv)   provide training and guidance to scientists involved in outreach research
programs on principles and methodologies of farming systems research taking
into account farm families objectives, resources and capacity and how these
affect adoption rates of agricultural technology;
(v)   train his assigned local counterparts in accordance with a detailed
training program prepared in liaison with MOA and IAAS;
(vi)  review IAAS curriculum on farming systems approach or, in abstentia,
contribute to the formulation of such curriculum; and
(vii)   work in close collaboration with the Extension Management Specialist, the
Agricultural Communication Specialist, the Gender Specialist and the local
Extension Management and Training consultants.
Nature, Timing and Length of Assignment
7.    The international Farming Systems (outreach) Research Expert will be recruited for a
total of 12 person months as follows during the project life span: 2 months the first year, 4
months each the second and the third year, and 2 months the fourth year. A local Farming
System Research Specialist engaged for about 35 months within the five years of the project
would build up on the international consultant to further strengthen the links between research,
extension and farmers.
Training of Counterparts
8.    The consultant will at the end of his first two-month stay in Nepal prepare a detailed
training program for the central and the regional counterparts assigned to him. The proposed
training program will be submitted to both MOA and IAAS for their comments and



- 42 -
endorsement. The latter two entities will, together with the consultant, define key indicators for
the proper monitoring and evaluation of the counterparts training program which will start the
second year.
Reporting
9.     The consultant will submit a progress report at the end of each of his stays in the
country, highlighting the specificities of the farming systems approach in the nepali context, the
limitations, and the constraints. Also, he will prepare a Farming Systems Operational Guidelines
no later than the end of his second mission to Nepal.
Qualification and Experience
10.   The candidate should have agricultural sciences, agricultural economics and rural
sociology background with preferably a post-graduate degree in one of these areas. The
consultant should have a broad range of international experience and possibly some prior
experience in the Nepali farming systems programs and projects. Finally, the candidate must be
fluent in English and have proven teaching skills.

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
The Nepal Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP) sets out a strategy for overall economic growth
that centers around the acceleration of agricultural growth. The strategy calls for agricultural
growth to be accelerated mainly through policy changes and concentrated investments in: (1)
shallow tubewell irrigation in the Tarai, (2) well-controlled year-round water supplies in both
the Tarai and Hill regions, (3) agricultural roads and rural electrification, (4) fertilizer, and (5)
the technology systems of research and extension. The strategy relies on increasing production
and productivity of basic food crops, high value crops, and livestock over the next 20 years.
The Nepal Research and Extension Project outlines the investments that will be made in the
technology systems of agricultural research and extension. This annex presents an ex ante
economic analysis that estimates the economic rate of return (ERR) to investments made under
the Research and Extension Project.  The analysis uses the economic surplus approach for
estimating the benefits from investments in research and extension and follows the methodology
outlined in Alston et al. (1995) and the method used by The World Bank Staff Appraisal Report
for Bangladesh (World Bank, 1996a).
The analysis focuses on estimating the ERR from research and extension investments in the
basic food crops of rice, maize, and wheat. While high value crops and livestock are very
important to Nepal and to the APP strategy, rice, maize and wheat dominate Nepal's agriculture.
Rice, maize and wheat account for 85% of total cropped land area and 93% of cereal production.
Rice alone accounts for about one-fourth of the gross domestic product (Manandhar and Shakya,
1996). About 50% of the Project funds will be directly or indirectly invested to increase
production and productivity of the three commodities. Thus, a quantitative estimate of the
benefits and returns for these three dominant commodities will give a good picture of the size
and rate of return to the overall project.
The Empirical Model
The small open-economy economic surplus model (Alston et al., 1995, p. 380) was used ex-ante
to calculate the change in economic surplus from a shift downward in the supply curve due to the
adoption of interventions attributed to agricultural research. The small open economy model is
used because some trade in rice, maize and wheat usually takes place internationally (both
official and unofficial trade) each year but the trade is not large enough to influence world prices.
The empirical model formula for estimating the change in economic surplus (benefits from
investment in research) is as follows:
ATSt = Kt P'tQ't * (1 + 0.5Kt s)                     (1)



- 44 -
Where ATSt is the change in total economic surplus attributed to research investment, P't is the
pre-research commodity price, Q't is the pre-research quantity produced in year t, e is the
elasticity of supply, and Kt is the proportionate shift downward in the supply curve in period t
attributable to research investment. Quantity Q't can be adjusted for exogenous increases from
non-research sources by a linear appreciation factor. Exogenous factors such as increased inputs,
increased land utilization, or research spill-in effects from other countries can increase
production apart from production increases brought about through indigenous research and
extension efforts. The exogenous increase is calculated as Q't = Qo (I+s)t where Qo is the
initial base production quantity and s is the growth rate trend expressed as an annual percentage
change. The proportionate shift Kt is further adjusted as follows:
Kt = ((E (Y) /s) - (E (C) / (I + E(Y) ))) x (pAt (I - t))  (2)
where E(Y) is the expected proportional yield change per hectare given that research is
successful and the resulting interventions fully adopted, E(C) is the proportionate change in
variable costs required to achieve the expected yield, p is the probability of research success, St
is the linear research depreciation factor, and At is the rate of intervention adoption by farmers
which may take on the traditional S-shaped adoption curve growth pattern. A research lag may
be introduced. For example, if research on a new variety takes 7 years before it is available for
dissemination to farmers, then the first 7 years of the rate of intervention adoption is zero (i.e.,
A1, ... , A7 = 0).
The change in total economic surplus as calculated by equation (1) is calculated for a 15 year
future time horizon for research that is undertaken over the life of the Research and Extension
Project (5 years). The net present value of the benefits (NPVB) is then calculated and given by:
n
NPVB = E  (ATSt - Ct) (I + r)-t                          (3)
where Ct is the cost of research investment in year t, r is the discount rate, and n is the time
horizon over which the benefits of the research investments are realized. The NPVB indicates the
amount of total funds returned from the investment in research.
The economic rate of return (ERR) is calculated relating the benefits (ATSt ) to the 5 years of
research expenditure and is the discount rate that results in a zero NPVB. The ERR is calculated
as:
n
O = Z  (ATSt -Ct )( + ERR)-t                             (4)
Project Interventions
The Research and Extension project will allow new interventions to be produced and
disseminated to farmers. The specific research programs and interventions are outlined in Annex



- 45 -
??. In the case of crops, the interventions will have the most impact on increasing production and
productivity by increasing the yield/ha, and in some instances, allow for increased cropping
intensity. Although increases in quality may come about, the prime impact will be on increased
production and productivity.
The priority rice research areas under the Project are soil fertility and integrated nutrient
management, and new varietal development (increased yield, disease resistance). Priority
research areas for maize are varietal development (increased yield, disease resistance, and
drought tolerance), agronomic and soil fertility management, and post harvest management
technologies. Wheat research priorities are mainly focused on varietal development (increased
yield, disease resistance, and milling quality). The Project support given to IPM research and
other programs will also contribute to increased productivity of the three commodities.
A major research thrust is the support of research on the sustainable intensification of the
rice/wheat cropping systems. Studies to-date have indicated that, with appropriate interventions,
the rice-wheat cropping system can have a major impact on increasing farm level income,
production, and productivity (Hobbs and Morris, 1996; Hobbs et al., 1996). A major constraint is
the labor and time shortage at rice harvest leading to late planting of wheat resulting in poor
wheat crop establishment. Other constraints are fertilizer and irrigation water availability and
declining soil fertility problems. Interventions from the Project include earlier maturing rice
varieties, wheat varietal improvement, soil nutrient management, mechanization of rice harvest
to allow timely planting of wheat, reduced tillage and no tillage options for timely wheat
planting resulting in lower costs and lower soil degradation. Mechanization calls for the use of
Chinese tractors and harvesting and seeding equipment.
It is estimated that 0.5 million hectares (mostly in the Tarai) are now under full rice/wheat
production and that the potential exists to increase this amount to 0.85 million hectares. The
increase of 0.35 million hectares would increase total wheat plantings by almost 30%. The
potential land for rice/wheat cropping is now mainly planted to rice. Thus the main effect from
the rice/wheat cropping systems research and resulting interventions would be to increase wheat
production through both an increase in hectares planted and from a productivity increase.
However, increasing the number of hectares sown to rice/wheat not only depends on research
interventions but also on the APP improvements to irrigation and fertilizer use.
Model Scenarios
The APP (pgs. 39-41) outlines five different cases of what may happen to growth rates
depending on the extent of the implementation of the overall APP strategy. The five cases are:
(1) All APP policies and interventions are implemented including increases in expected fertilizer
use rates and improved irrigation to provide a full impact.
(2) Same as case 1 but only one-half of the expected improved irrigation area has been realized.
(3) Same as case 2 but irrigation improvement delayed for five years.
(4) Same as case 3 but expected application rates of fertilizer are reduced by 80% in the second
APP five year period, then by 70%, 65% in the two subsequent APP five year periods and
then continue at 60% of the maximum expected fertilizer levels under the APP.
(5) Present policies and priorities continue with no effect from the APP.



- 46 -
Under case 1, fertilizer application rates would increase from the present average 25 kg/ha to 42
kg/ha in 1999-2000, 64 kg/ha in 2004-2005, to 94 kg/ha in 2009-2010 and to 131 kg/ha in 2014-
2015 and remain at this rate thereafter (APP, p. 91). Under APP case 1, arable area expansion by
irrigation over a period of 20 years is estimated to be a net increase of 13,000 hectares in the
Mountains, a net increase of 85,000 hectares in the Hills, and a net increase of 578,000 hectares
in the Tarai (APP, Table 4-2, p. 73). The increases in the Mountains and Hills comes from
increasing year-round surface water while in the Tarai, approximately 15% comes from an
increase in year-round surface water and 85% from increased ground water (shallow tubewell)
irrigation. Total arable land does not change from increasing irrigation, however crop area
expansion is increased through the ability to multiple crop.
The NPVB and the ERR to research and extension investments under the Research and
Extension Project depends on the extent of the implementation of the APP. Both the NPVB and
the ERR would be expected to be higher under APP case I than under APP case 5, For this
report, the economic surplus analysis has been run for two separate scenarios as follows:
(1) Scenario 1: Research and Extension Project fully implemented but other APP policies and
priorities not implemented (APP case 5).
(2) Scenario 2: Research and Extension Project fully implemented but irrigation improvement
delayed by five years and expected application rates of fertilizer reduced as in APP case 4.
The above two scenarios will indicate the NPVB and the ERR for the minimum returns that
could be expected without the APP (scenario 1) and for what could be expected when the APP is
moderately successful. Returns would be expected to be higher than scenario 2 returns for the
full implementation of the APP. NPVB and ERR for each of the above two scenarios is first
calculated for rice, maize, and wheat separately using the empirical model. The analysis of the
rice/wheat cropping sequence research is amalgamated with the overall wheat analysis. Once this
is complete, a NPVB and ERR is calculated for the three commodities as a group.
The Data
Market Related Data and Information
Commodity prices (P't): Economic values are used as prices and are borrowed from a recent
Nepal irrigation sector project economic analysis (World Bank, 1996b). The prices per tonne
used in the analysis are NRs 14,210, NRs 13,510, and NRs 15,900 for rice paddy, maize and
wheat respectively.
Production quantities (Q't): The initial production quantities (Qo) used in the analysis are
3,160, 1,275, and 875 thousand tonnes for rice paddy, maize and wheat respectively and are
1991-92 to 1995-96 five year averages (Manandhar and Shakya, 1996). Corresponding average
yield/ha for rice, maize, and wheat are 2,255, 1,650, and 1,400 kg/ha respectively.
Supply elasticities (E): Reliable supply elasticities for rice, maize and wheat do not exist. The
more inelastic the supply elasticity (closer to zero), the larger the change will .be in the net
benefits (ATSt). Thus, to avoid inflating the net benefits to any great extent, the supply elasticity
is set to 0.8 for all three commodities and thus represents an intermnediate to long-run supply



- 47 -
elasticity. For comparison, a sensitivity analysis shows the results under a supply elasticity of
0.7 and 0.9.
The discount rate (r): The interest rate used for discounting the benefits and research
expenditures in equation (3) to obtain the net present value is set at 12 percent. This is in line
with World Bank discount rates used for similar projects.
Exogenous growth rates (s): Past annual percentage growth rates (1980-81 to 1995-96) in rice,
maize and wheat production have been 1.1%, 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. These growth rates
can be attributed to both indigenous research and extension investments and to exogenous
factors. In the analysis, the growth rate trend (s) is set at 1% for scenario I and 2% for scenario
2 for each of the three commodities. It is anticipated that there would be a higher degree of spill-
in effect with the momentum of the APP.
Research Related Data and Information
Research related data and information pertains to the research and extension costs of the Project
and to the parameters in equation (2). The information for the parameters in equation (2) was
solicited primarily from personal interviews with research managers and scientists and key
extension personnel. The information relies on their perceptions of the future but these are based
on their many years of previous experience.
A. Parameters that remain constant over the three scenarios
Research expenditures (C): As research and extension are both responsible for increasing
production and productivity under the Project, both expenditures are included as costs in the
analysis. The Project expenditures for each of the three commodities are presented in Table I
and are the yearly expected direct and indirect expenditures to be made under the Project. Also
Included in Table I is the amount to be spent on rice/wheat systems research which focuses
mainly on increasing wheat production in rice/wheat growing areas. The expenditures shown in
Table I have been derived from the Project Cost Summary figures in Annex ?? by identifying
and proportioning out the direct and indirect research and extension expenditures pertaining to
each commodity.
Probability of research success (p): Because not all research is successful, the proportionate
shift down the supply curve due to research is adjusted by the probability of research success.
After discussions with researchers, the probability of research success was set at 70% (i.e., p =
0.7) for all commodities which is a conservative estimate.
Research depreciation rates (3t ): The research depreciation rates used are those suggested by
Alston et al., (1995 p. 382). Depreciation starts in the ninth year at Sg = 0.95 and decreases
yearly by an absolute 5 percent.
B. Parameters that change with each scenario
Expected proportional change in yield (E(Y)): Increases in the yield/hectare from APP
implementation will come mainly from interactions among (i) technology interventions (research
and extension), (ii) increased fertilizer use, and (iii) increased irrigation use inputs. The effect on



- 48 -
yield increments of all three inputs will have to be accounted for in the analysis and the costs to
increased fertilizer inputs and irrigation netted out so that a rate of return to research and
extension can be obtained.
Scenario 1: With policies and investments in fertilizer and irrigation remaining as they are (no
APP), future increases in yield/ha will only come from research and extension interventions
interacting with present fertilizer use and irrigation levels. Without the APP, increase in fertilizer
use and increased irrigation will take place but at a very slow rate of increase leading to a
minimal impact on production and productivity increases. In the absence of the Research and
Extension Project, the present Nepal research and extension service can be expected to undertake
sufficient research to cover maintenance research as well as add to increased yield/ha for rice,
maize and wheat, mainly through new varietal development (with the aid of International
Centers). The Research and Extension Project is seen as bolstering existing research programs as
well as supporting some new research endeavors. On average, a conservative estimate of the
perrnanent change in yield/ha from all expected interventions is 15% (i.e., E(Y) = .15) for all
three commodities in the analysis given that research is successful and fully adopted. However,
only a proportion can be claimed by the Research and Extension Project and this is set at 60%.
The remaining 40% is claimed by the on-going national and international expenditures on these
research programs.
The rice/wheat cropping sequence area in Nepal grew at 3% per year between 1975-76 and 1991-
92 (Hobbs et al., 1996). However, in the absence of improved irrigation, roads and rural
electrification from the APP, the growth rate is likely to decline substantially even with research
on the rice/wheat cropping systems under the Research and Extension Project. While there will
no doubt be an increase in the area of rice/wheat sequence planting that will be directly related to
the research under the Project, it is reasonable to assume that the impact would be small. For this
reason, returns to rice/wheat research and extension efforts are not calculated for scenario 1;
they are however, calculated for scenario 2 where irrigation from the APP comes into play.
Scenario 2: In addition to increases in yield/ha from research and extension, yield/ha will also
be increased by more fertilizer use and irrigation inputs. Fertilizer and irrigation policies and
investments will be those a described under APP case 4. Fertilizer application rates would
increase from the present average 25 kg/ha to 34 kg/ha in 1999-2000, 45 kg/ha in 2004-2005,
and to 60 kg/ha in 2009-2010. Using a ratio of 10:1 for the average kilograms of grain/kilogram
of fertilizer nutrient use, as used by the APP (APP p. 47), this translates into an average
percentage increase in yield/ha from increased fertilizer use for rice, maize, and wheat of 5% for
the second five year period, and 12% for the third five year period. Since no breakdown on
fertilizer use by crop is available, it is assumed that fertilizer application is equal on all three
crops. For modeling purposes, production quantities related to the percentage increases in
production from increased fertilizer use (i.e, from the 5% and 12%) are added to Q't in equation
(1).
Both surface irrigation and ground water irrigation improvements are proposed under the APP.
However, investments in surface water schemes are slated for the last half of the APP period and,
as indicated by the APP, will have only a modest effect on crop output over the remaining life of
the APP Project (APP, p. 74). As the APP indicates, the driving force with respect to cropped
area and production increases is ground water development. Table 2 shows the increment in
crop area expansion from the APP irrigation thrust. This is land that is now mainly in rainfed



- 49 -
crops (rice and maize in the wet season) that will become irrigated year-round and thus have the
potential for multiple cropping, of which the rice/wheat cropping sequence will likely dominate.
Thus irrigation will (i) increase the yield/ha of the wet season crops now grown on the soon to be
new irrigated land, and (ii) allow for increased production of wheat and other crops in the dry
season on the newly irrigated land. It is assumed that fertilizer would be applied at the full APP
rates of 152 nutrient kg/ha (APP, table 5-2). In terms of (i), irrigation is estimated to increase the
average rice yield/ha by 45% and double the average maize yield/ha (World Bank, 1996b, Table
59). It is assumed that as the new irrigation land becomes available in the Tarai, 80% will be
used for rice and 20% for maize production in the wet season.
For (ii) above, the average irrigated wheat yield/ha that can be expected on the newly irrigated
land is 3,000 kg/ha (World Bank, 1996b, table 59). Research scientists estimated that about
350,000 hectares are suitable for the rice/wheat cropping sequence but the number of hectares
devoted to rice/wheat will depend on the pace of the increments in crop area expansion from the
APP. Scientists and extension specialists indicated that 10% of the hectares suitable to rice/wheat
could be put into production each year over a ten year period once the interventions (including
irrigation) were made available to the farmers. For scenario 2, irrigation improvement is delayed
by five years and thus, so is the acceleration of the rice/wheat cropping sequence expansion. An
adoption rate of 10% per year is used starting in the second five year period. As in the case of
fertilizer, production quantities related to the increases in production from increased irrigation
use are added to Q't in equation (1) in the appropriate models.
As there is an interaction effect between the increased fertilizer rates and the new interventions
(mainly new varieties) from the Research and Extension Project, the permanent change in
yield/ha (E(Y)) from all expected interventions would be higher than the 15% used in scenario 1.
The permanent change in yield/ha from all expected interventions is set at 18% in the second
five year period and 20% in the third five year period of the analysis. Thus E(Y) = 0.18 and 0.20
for all three commodities in the analysis given that research is successful and fully adopted. The
proportion that can be claimed by the Research and Extension Project is set a 70%.
Research lag and adoption rate (At): Many of the research programs are on-going and in
addition to some new research, the Project funds will mainly bolster many of the on-going
programs. Thus the research lag period will be shorter than if the research programs were all
starting new. Research lags can be up to eight years before a new variety is available for
dissemination to farmers but shorter for other interventions. A four year research lag is used for
an overall research lag across all interventions for each commodity in the analysis.
Scenario 1: The farmer adoption rate over all interventions was set at 5 percent starting in year 5
to allow for the research lag and increased to 10 percent in the next year and increasing by an
absolute 5 percent each year thereafter. Thus 55% of all hectares will have adopted the
interventions by the last year of the 15 year time horizon (by the year 2011) which is a
conservative estimate.
Scenario 2: The adoption rate of the Research and Extension project interventions would be
expected to be higher in scenario 2 than in scenario 1 because of the momentum of the overall
APP project. For scenario 2, The farmer adoption rate over all interventions was set at 15
percent starting in year 5 to allow for the research lag and increased to 20 percent in the next
year and increasing by an absolute 5 percent each year thereafter up 50% but increasing by 10%

per year thereafter. Thus 80% of all hectares will have adopted the interventions by the last year
of the 15 year time horizon.
Proportionate change in variable costs (E(C)): The adoption of an intervention may involve a
change in the amount of purchased inputs required to make use of the new intervention. The
costs from intervention adoption may increase or decrease the production costs/ha or may have
no effect on the cost structure. These cost changes (E(C)) must be accounted for by either
subtracting or adding them to the overall change in economic surplus.
Scenario 1: Little change in production costs are anticipated under scenario I for rice, maize and
wheat in the absence of improved fertilizer use and irrigation. The interventions are mostly
improved seed and better agronomic and soil management practices. Production costs/ha are
assessed as being 2% above present average production costs/ha for scenario 1 (based on crop
budgets from Departnent of Agriculture Development, 1994).
Scenario 2: The economic price of fertilizer, delivered plus application cost, is NRs 25/kg
nutrient (based on World Bank, 1996b). This translates into an incremental fertilizer cost/ha of
NRs 225 for the second five year period and NRs 500 for the third the five year period under
APP case 4 fertilizer application rates. Given an overall average cost of production of NRs
8,000/ha (Department of Agriculture Development, 1994) for rice, maize and wheat, the
percentage in the increase in production costs from adding the incremental fertilizer application
is 3% for the second five year period and 6% for the third five year period of the analysis.
For the rice/wheat cropping sequence, operation and maintenance economic costs for shallow
tube wells is NRs 2,717/ha (World Bank, 1996b, p.3). The initial investment cost of a shallow
tube well is NRs 20,000/ha (APP, Table 4-5). Amortized over 15 years at 12% gives an annual
cost of NRs 2,936. These costs are netted out in the calculation of the change in economic
surplus.
Under the Research and Extension Project, interventions in the rice/wheat cropping systems
include (i) reduced or minimum till, and (ii) introduction of tractors and equipment. Reduced or
minimum till for wheat planting will reduce the production costs/ha while, the introduction of
tractors will increase the production cost/ha. The cost of land preparation for planting wheat in
the rice/wheat cropping sequence is estimated at NRs 2,160/ha (Hobbs et al. 1996, p. 44). The
cost of a Chinese tractor and seeding and harvesting equipment is estimated to be NRs 110,000
which, when amortized over 15 years at 12%, gives a yearly cost of NRs 16,150. As the average
holding size of land is about one hectare, it is likely that only large farmers (or farmer groups)
could afford the tractors and equipment but a rental market would develop for smaller farmers.
Minimum tillage would mean a savings of the NRs 2,160/ha but a rental charge/ha would have to
be paid for the tractor and equipment. As yet, no rental market exists. The rental charge would
likely be under NRs 2160/ha and thus, in all likelihood, there would be a savings.from the shift
to minimum tillage. In the analysis, because of the unavailability of the rental market rate, it is
assumed that the tractor rental cancels out the savings from reduced tillage which will may bias
the returns downward.
Results and Sensitivity Analysis
Base Model Returns: Table 3 presents the base model results and selected sensitivity analyses.
The base model results indicate significant rates of return for both scenarios I and 2. The overall



-51 -
ERR to rice, maize and wheat research as a group from the Project was estimated at 51% in
scenario 1 and 70% in scenario 2. The returns from scenario 1 would be expected to be the
minimum rates of return. Rates of return, had they been calculated for the full implementation of
the APP (APP case 1), would be expected to be higher than those calculated for scenario 2. The
NPVBs and the ERRs are consistent across the three commodities with rice being the highest
followed by maize and then wheat. This mainly reflects the size of production. For example, rice
production is about 3.5 times as large as wheat production and thus the returns from the
interventions for rice are gathered in over a wider production base. The returns to wheat research
may seem small particularly in light of the research thrust on the rice/wheat cropping sequence.
They are lower than the 75-84% IRRs estimated by Morris et al., (1996) for past wheat research
rates of return but their analysis is only on wheat breeding with a different investment schedule
and time horizon for the analysis. However, they estimate that future returns for wheat breeding
are likely to have an IRR of 38%-48%. But considering the size of the wheat production base
and the fact that the hectares available for wheat in the rice/wheat cropping sequence were
increased at 10% per year, the base model results are favorable. Finally, given that the entire
discounted net present value of the Nepal Agricultural Research and Extension Project
(economic) expenditures is NPs. 1,016 million, it is interesting to note that the NPVB for rice
(scenario 1) is NPs 2,619 million. Thus the returns from the investment in rice research from the
project (scenario 1) alone returns more than 2.5 times the cost of the entire project.
Sensitivity Analysis: Most parameters were given moderate values so as to be sure not to bias
the results in favor of high rates of returns. Yield increments from research interventions were
set at moderate levels as was the probability of research success which was set at 0.7. The
analysis was carried out over a 15 year time horizon but could have been carried out over or
twenty or even thirty years as the effect of some of the interventions would be producing
benefits at that time. A lengthier analysis time horizon would undoubtedly have made a positive
increase to both the NPVB and the ERR. However, because of the discounting effect (at 12%)
of obtaining the NPVB and the research depreciation factor ( t), which increases appreciably
over time, the extra NPBV from carrying out the analysis over a twenty or thirty year period
would not be substantially higher nor would there be a large increase in the ERR. Thus, in this
respect, the results of the analysis are conservative
A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on selected model parameters to identify the impact on the
NPVB and ERR. First, returns can be sensitive to the supply elasticity. Table 3 presents the
results for the base model with a supply elasticity of 0.9 and then 0.7 to contrast the results with
the base model results which use a 0.8 supply elasticity. The 0.9 elasticity (Model II), decreases
the NPVB and the ERR but the changes appear not to be overly sensitive to the supply elasticity
change. The 0:7 supply elasticity (Model III), gives more robust returns. Model IV Is run with an
increase in the research expenditures by a factor of 1.5. This is analogous to adding on a value
for the marginal cost of public funds (MCPF) as was done in the Bangladesh ERR analysis
(World Bank, 1996a). Again, the results are not overly sensitive. Model V. is run with a decrease
of 25% in the rice, maize and wheat prices which decreases the returns from the base model but
still maintains a sufficiently high level of returns. Model VI. Indicates the results when the
probability of research success is changed to 60% from 70%. Model VII identifies the results
when the research lag period of four years is increased to six years. Thus, in scenario 1, 45% of
all hectares will have adopted interventions by the last year of the 15 year time horizon. The
comparable figure for scenario 2 is 60%.
