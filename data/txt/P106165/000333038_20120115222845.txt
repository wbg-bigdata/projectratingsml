A. SUMMARY

This Restructuring Paper (RP) introduces changes to the Lao PDR Trade Development Facility (TDF) Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and its accompanying legal document: RETF Grant Agreement No. TF091201. The
proposed changes are to: (i) update the detailed financing plan by sub-components to fully utilize MDTF re-
sources in light of (a) contributions from a third donor to the MDTF, and (b) realization of exchange rate dis-
counts and earned investment income; (ii) include the updated results matrix and project indicators; (iii) add a
new category of disbursement and reallocation of grant funds to allow for small renovations of the project unit
offices and, (iv) extend the closing date of the RETF from February 28, 2012 to March 31, 2013. The closing date
extension will ensure that there is sufficient time available to complete all activities. A revised action plan that
reflects the new proposed closing date has been agreed with the Government. This will be the first extension of
the project.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Background. The TDF Project is a recipient-executed project financed from a Multi Donor Trust Fund, with con-
tributions by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAid), the European Commission (EC) and
the Deutsche Gesellschaft für International Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). The TDF is executed by the Ministry of In-
dustry and Commerce (MoIC), under the supervision of the Lao Integrated Framework Secretariat. The overall
objective of the project is to support the establishment of the National Integrated Framework Governance Struc-
ture (NIFGS) and implement NIFGS‟s initial activities to address key institutional and operational bottlenecks
and capacity gaps that hinder cross-border trade.

The TDF is designed with five main components: (A) Trade Facilitation; (B) Strengthening of Sanitary and Phy-
to-Sanitary Standards and Technical Barriers to Trade Frameworks; (C) Export Competitiveness and Business
Environment;, (D) Capacity Building, Trade Policy, Trade Agreements, and Global Opportunities; and, (E)
Strengthening of the National Implementation Unit. The five components contribute to the overarching outcomes
of the project which are:

       Better trading environment, with simplified bureaucratic procedures including in customs;
       Improved legal and regulatory framework;
       Enhanced capacity of line ministries and agencies involved in the trade sector;
       Improved private sector capacity to compete in the international market;
       More effective participation in bilateral and multilateral negotiations; and,
       Increased competitiveness of Lao PDR products and contribution to poverty reduction.

Implementation progress. Progress towards achievements of PDO is rated Satisfactory and overall imple-
mentation progress is also rated as being Satisfactory. The project had a slow start due to the challenges as-
sociated with establishing a new multi donor approach. This resulted in delays altogether of over a year between
appraisal, signing of administrative agreements with donors, signing of the grant agreement and project effective-
ness. In addition, the TDF is the first project fully executed by the MoIC, and it took some time for the newly es-
tablished National Implementation Unit (NIU) to recruit essential fiduciary staff and to get up to speed with Bank
procedures and guidelines. However, the project is now running smoothly with an increasingly experienced and
confident implementation team. All major procurement selections have now been completed and activities are
proceeding across all components.




                                                                                                                  4
Disbursements. The initial allocation to the RE TF091201 was for US$ 6.82 million. To date the RETF has dis-
bursed US$ 3.5 million (equivalent to 51 percent of the grant amount) and outstanding commitments to date are of
the order of US$ 1.7 million.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

    Components

The overall component structure will remain unchanged, that is, no new component has been added since project
design. The detailed financing plan by sub-components will be updated to fully utilize MDTF resources in light
of: (a) contributions from a third donor to the MDTF, and (b) realization of exchange rate discounts and earned
investment income. The detailed table of the revised components and respective allocations is included in Annex
1 to this Restructuring Paper.

Cost overruns and savings
Additional resources are required to complete the full scope of activities planned under the Trade Portal assign-
ment (Component A). Similarly, additional resources are required to support an intensified pace of WTO acces-
sion negotiations (Component D). Cost savings have occurred under Component B where less technical assistance
has been required than originally envisaged under the project.

Additional activities under Component D: Capacity building, trade policy, trade agreements and global oppor-
tunities
As a member of ASEAN, Lao PDR is progressively complying with requirements to reduce tariffs under the
ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, and to harmonize and simplify border procedures in line with the objectives
of the ASEAN Economic Community. Major reforms and investments are underway that will contribute towards
improved compliance with ASEAN commitments1. A series of additional activities are planned under the TDF to
support the work of GoL in implementing trade-related commitments under the ASEAN Economic Blueprint.
These activities will be incorporated into Component D (Capacity Building, Trade Policy, Trade Agreements and
Global Opportunities) of the TDF, with work planning managed directly by the ASEAN Division, Foreign Trade
Policy Department. Responsibility for overall coordination will remain with the National Implementation Unit.
These activities will be divided into three principle sub-components:

Regional trade policy diagnostics and research. Regional/international short-term technical assistance will sup-
port the ASEAN Division in carrying out a series of analytical studies in the following indicative areas: (i) An
assessment of the impact of potential new agreements such as trade in service agreements under the ASEAN
(plus) and the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement; and (ii) A diagnostic review of preference utilization by Lao
exporters under overlapping bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements, including a detailed assessment
of the determinants of limited preference utilization and of the restrictiveness of different rules-of-origin and non-
tariff measures. Selected consultants will also be expected to focus on building the capacity of staff in the ASEAN
Division to undertake trade policy analysis, and on the identification of specific recommendations for policy and
investment by the ASEAN Division.

Awareness raising, outreach and implementation of regional trade commitments. A series of outreach activities
will be undertaken as part of efforts to raise awareness among government and private sector stakeholders on Lao
PDR‟s existing and future regional trade commitments. Based on the diagnostic studies undertaken within sub-
component 1 and the ongoing commitment stock-taking exercise, resources will be made available to support im-
plementation of outstanding commitments under AFTA and the AEC-Blueprint. Similarly, this sub-component
will support implementation, reforms and capacity building related to addressing priority constraints such as
rules-of-origin and non-tariff measures inhibiting the full utilization of regional trade agreements by Lao expor-
ters. The ASEAN Division will also work to ensure that regional commitments and requirements are fully inte-

  The installation of ASYCUDA World by the Lao Customs Department (financed via the IDA Customs and Trade Facilitation Project) and the
establishment of a Trade Portal by the Department of Imports and Exports (under Component A of the TDF MDTF) are key parts of efforts by GoL
to move towards electronic processing and the establishment of a National Single Window, consistent with the ASEAN Single Window.

                                                                                                                                          5
grated into existing trade facilitation initiatives such as the development of the Lao Trade Portal 2 and ASYCUDA
World.

The additional funds allocated will also provide for coordination and management support costs, including the
provision of a full-time national research policy analyst/coordinator based in the ASEAN Division of the MoIC
Foreign Trade Policy Department.

      Financing plan

The initial parent MDTF for the TDF was setup with two main donors: AusAid and the EC. The total pledged
contribution in US$ equivalent was approximately: US$ 8.50 million (at the time of establishment), out of which
US$ 6.82 million was allocated to the recipient executed trust fund. Unpaid donor contributions were discounted
at 20 percent. To date, the project has benefitted from additional resources: (i) realization of exchange rate dis-
counts as unpaid donor commitments have been paid in; (ii) earned investment income; and (iii) additional fund-
ing from a third donor (GIZ) who recently signed an administrative agreement to join the MDTF. As a result, the
total amount available to the RETF increases from US$ 6,815,855 to US$ 7,600,000. The restructuring of the
project and extension request will require no additional resources for the administration and supervision of the
RETF.

      Results Matrix/Indicators

The overall project development objective of the TDF remains unchanged. The PDO is “to support the establish-
ment of the National Integrated Framework Governance Structure (NIFGS) and implement NIFGS‟s initial activi-
ties to address the key institutional and operational bottlenecks and capacity gaps that hinder cross-border trade?.
While a results framework was not included in the initial PAD, efforts were undertaken by the Ministry of Indus-
try and Commerce to prepare a detailed framework for monitoring results during the initial stages of project im-
plementation. The final results framework was endorsed during the midterm review mission (January 2011); and
is included as Annex 2 to this RP. A comprehensive monitoring framework for these indicators with baselines and
target measurements can be found in the project file.

      Implementation timeline

In a letter dated May 5, 2011, the Ministry of Finance is requesting an extension of the closing date for the Lao
PDR Trade Development Facility Project (TF091201 / P106165) from February 28, 2012 until March 31, 2013.
The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that the originally planned four-year implementation period re-
mains available. Due to start-up delays associated with the establishment of a multi donor approach, significant
time was lost between appraisal, the signing of donor administrative agreements, the signing of the grant agree-
ment and project effectiveness. This resulted in compression of the available time for implementation to just over
three years. The closing date extension will ensure that there is sufficient time available to complete all activities.
This will be the first extension of the project.
