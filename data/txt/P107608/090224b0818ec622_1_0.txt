                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall implementation progress of the Project is satisfactory. The latest reported results present evidence that the Project Development Objectives are likely to be achieved by
                         the end of the Project.

                         The maintenance works in Osh city have been completed at the end of October 2012. By October 1, 2012, 4,092 person-months of temporary jobs have been created.
                         Civil works to rehabilitate the Pulgon-Burgandy section (32kms) of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor have been completed on-time as well. Traffic along the road section has

                         increased substantially from 3,046 vpd (2009) to 3,814 vpd (2012) with a ten-fold increase in truck traffic. Based on the field visit to the Project site undertaken in June 2013, the
                         quality of works appears to be good. This has also been confirmed by the final report prepared by the supervision consultant, Kocks Consult GmbH.

                         The civil works contract for the Nookat Pass and sections in and around Osh and Jalal-Abad city has been awarded. Works are expected to start after the final draft Resettlement

                         Action Plan has been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. Assuming the works will start in the Spring 2013, the completion date for road repair and rehabilitation along
                         Nookat Pass and sections in and around Osh and Jalal-Abad city is expected to be in November 2014.

                         The development and launch of a national safety program and action plan is expected to be completed in 2013 as the consultancy services are on-going. Consultancy services to
                         support the development of road asset management system and review financing options for road maintenance activities by municipalities are currently being procured. The work is
                         expected to start mid-2013.

                         During the last implementation support mission by the Bank team (June 2012) extensive dialogue with beneficiaries and communities was undertaken to appraise social issues and
                         conflict-sensitivity within the Project. The objective of focus group discussions was to assess beneficiary-level outcomes, perceptions and needs in relation to ongoing road works as
                         well as potential consideration of future works. These discussions demonstrated social and economic constraints of local communities stemming from inadequate condition of the
                         road corridor. While ongoing and completed road works are notably improving their life, the local communities pointed out the importance of considering rehabilitation of the feeder
                         roads branching from the road corridor in future works due to their poor conditions and importance in enhancing social and economic access to villages. The Bank is now initiating an
                         analysis of social and economic benefits resulting from the rehabilitation of sections of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor (primarily from new roadside construction and
                         businesses).
