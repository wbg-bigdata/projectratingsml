                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall implementation progress of the Project is satisfactory. The latest reported results present evidence that the Project Development Objectives are likely to be achieved by
                         the end of the Project. Substantial progress has been achieved on employment generation in Osh city: 2,748 person-months of temporary jobs have been created to date.

                         Civil works to rehabilitate 32 kms of the Pulgon-Burgandy section of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor are progressing well and are on track to be completed within the allocated
                         budget by the end of this year's construction season. Both the contractor and the supervision consultant have indicated that the contract duration may have to be extended, possible

                         extension is not expected to be for more than one or two months, when the pavement will be completed and the contractor will focus on finishing works.

                         Repair of urban roads in the city of Osh are also progressing at pace. The current progress indicates that the works will be completed by end of October 2012.

                         Proposed civil works along the Nookat Pass and roads within and around the city of Osh are at the tendering stage now. The selected contractor is expected to mobilize to the site
                         before the end of construction season (October 2012).

                         Consultancy contracts for (i) the development and launch of a national road safety program, preparation of pilot demonstration projects for road safety and improvement of road
                         safety planning (NRRP; contract signed in December 2011), and (ii) the introduction of quality management system to enhance public service delivery in the road sector (contract
                         signed in May 2011), financed through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant are at the inception stage. The terms of references for the consultancy services on (i) the Road
                         Asset Management Improvement, and (ii) Financing options for road maintenance activities by municipalities are currently being reviewed and finalized by the MOTC.

                         During the June 2012 mission the Bank team undertook extensive engagement of beneficiaries and communities to appraise social issues and conflict-sensitivity within the Project.
                         The objective of focus group discussions was to assess beneficiary-level outcomes, perceptions and needs in relation to ongoing road works as well as potential consideration of
                         future works. These discussions demonstrated social and economic constraints of local communities stemming from inadequate condition of the road corridor. While ongoing and
                         completed road works are notably improving their life, the local communities pointed out the importance of considering rehabilitation of the feeder roads branching from the road
                         corridor in future works due to their poor conditions and importance in enhancing social and economic access to villages. The Bank is now initiating an analysis of social and
                         economic benefits resulting rehabilitation of sections of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor (primarily from new roadside construction and businesses).
