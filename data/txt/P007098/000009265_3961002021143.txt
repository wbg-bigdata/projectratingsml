PRIVATE SECTOR  EVLPMENT: PROJEC
Loanand Proiect Summarv
1B owrrower      Corporaci6n Financiera Nacional (CFN)
G-ugAn_pr        Republic of Ecuador
Sa~lderAiA:      Accredited Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs):
Private medium and large enterprises in all sectors.
Amount:          US$75.0 million.
Terms:           US dollar single currency loan repayable over 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard LIBOR
based variable interest rate for US dollar single currency
loans.
Onlending:       CFN would relend US$75 million to accredited PFIs. The
relent resources would be denominated in dollars or in
sucres hidexed to the dollar. Pricing of the CFN loans to
the PFIs would be established, initially, through direct
negotiation between CFN and each PFI. The interest rate
charged by CFN to PPIs for dollar loans and sucre loans
indexed to the dollar would be based on a floor price equal
to the Bank's LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan
rate, plus a spread that will remain constant during the life
of the CFN loan. One year after effectiveness, CFN
would consider adopting an auction system for determining
the margins above the Bank's LIBOR based interest rate on
its loans to PFIs. Interest rates charged to subborrowers
would be freely agreed between the PFI and its clients.
Maturities would conform to the maturities of subloans
made by the PFIs to subborrowers, but would not exceed
12 years for fixed asset investments and 2 years for
permanent working capital. The maximum grace period
would be 3 years. CFN will make sucre denominated
loans to PFIs from locally mobilized resources with the
option of capitalization of the inflation part of the interest
rate during the grace period.

Qt i         :   Parallel credit lines from:
Inter-American Development Bank (1DB): US$100.0
million
Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento (CAP): US$25.0 million
Technical Assistance Loan from IDB of US$2.2 to support
CFN restructuring.
Emm
Q.b.jeti:        To support private sector development by
(i)  improving the efficiency of the financial sector by:
-reducing state competition with private banks through the
restructuring of CFN into a second-tier bank and the
elimination of the financial intermediation role of the
Central Bank.
-supporting recent measures to liberalize interest rates and
reduce commercial banks' forced investments.
-encouraing the development of longer-term sucre
investments by permitting indexation.
(ii)  improving the efficiency of the productive sector by:
-supporting recent trade liberalization measures, that
include reduction of tariff rates, elimination of quantitative
restrictions, and simplification of import and export
procedures
-expanding the role of the private sector by the sale of
CFN's equity investments.
-providing a more stable investment climate.
(iii) enabling the private sector to take advantage of the
liberalized trade regime through the timely provision of
term finance for private investments.
Project           The project would comprise the following components:
Desgription
(i)   a credit line to CFN to be passed onto commercial banks
and finance companies for on-lending to viable productive
enterprises for the purpose of financing fixed investments
and associated working capital
(ii)  policy conditionality linking continuation of disbursements
to no retrogression of previous trade and financial sector
reforms.



- iii -
Beneftts:          The main benefits of the proposed project would be the
increased efficiency and output of the productive and
financial sectors. Provision of term financing at a time
when Ecuador is adopting a more liberal trade regime and
removing barriers to private activity, should enable the
private sector to undertake the necessary investments for
export production and enterprise restructuring and
modernization that should accompany such a liberalization
program. The project would, therefore, help increase the
international competitiveness of Ecuadorean firms and
ensure private sector support for the reform agenda. CFN
will onlend the loan's funds in US dollars or sucres
indexed to the dollar to PFIs, who in turn will lend the
same currency to enterprises with revenues in dollars or
in sucres linked to international prices in US dollars.
Therefore, PFIs will not bear any currency risk and
business enteiprises will bear minimal currency risk.
Bofrowing on a US dollar single currency loan basiE will
enable CFN to eliminate the foreign exchange risk that it
would have borne with the Bank's currency pool loan.
The major risks to this project would be the Government's
failure to advance its stabilization program and reduce
inflation. High inflation, with the attendant expectation of
devaluation, could constrain dollar denominated credit
demand. To lessen this risk, the legal agreement will link
disbursements to the maintenance of free access to foreign
exchange. High levels of inflation also keep interest rates
of sucre loans at high nominal levels, which--in the
absence of indexing of principal--result in a heavy
financial burden for borrowers in the initial years of a
loan. High nominal rates could, therefore, constrain
credit demand in sucres. To lessen this risk, the project
would offer an interest capitalization scheme to
subborrowers to reduce the financial burden in the initial
years of the loan caused by high inflation. While the
onlending arrangement of this loan protects CFN from
interest rate risk, PFIs could face increased credit risk if
sharp increases in LIBOR caused subborrowers to be
unable to meet their debt obligations. CFN has determined
that these risks are more manageable than the currency
risks it would have faced with a currency pool loan.
There is also a risk of a reversal of trade, financial and
investment  policies  encouraged  by  an  unstable



- iv -
macroeconomic environment. The likelihood of this event
is being constrained by macroeconomic policy
conditionality. Furthermore, the loan legal agreements
would specify a review pause in loan disbursements to
ensure that the policy reforms supported by this operation
continue.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ECONOMIC SETTING
A. ReeL_Economic Developments
1.1         After enjoying rapid economic growth during the 1970's,
Ecuador's economic performance during most of the 1980's was
disappointing. Between 1971 and 1980 output growth averaged 9.1 % per
year and real per capita GDP almost doubled. This impressive growth was
led by the petroleum sector, which now accounts for 15% of GDP and close
to 45% of exports. This period of economic growth was accompanied,
however, by an expansion of the public sector and an array of protectionist
policies that eventually hindered development in the eighties. Some of the
factors that contributed to the economic difficulties encountered by Ecuador
in the eighties were the appreciation of the real exchange rate during the oil
boom, which stifled the development of non-oil exports and distorted the
growth pattern towards home consumption; excessive reliance on foreign
borrowing to finance increases in demand; price controls which discouraged
agricultural development; excessive protection that led to the development of
a small and inefficient manufacturing sector; and energy and interest rate
subsidies, along with labor market regulations, which created incentives for
capital-intensive development.
1.2         The development strategy followed by Ecuador in the
seventies exacerbated the structural rigidities in the economy and left the
country more vulnerable to the series of external and internal shocks that
buffeted the economy in the eighties. The vulnerability of the economy
became evident in 1982, when the world-wide debt crisis led to the cessation
of foreign credits. Following this event, the country experienced an abrupt
decline in oil prices at the beginning of 1986, and an earthquake in 1987,
which caused a six month interruption of oil exports. These developments,
along with some mismanagement of macroeconomic policies, severely
constrained economic growth and prolonged the economic crisis faced by the
country. In the last ten years, Ecuador's growth slipped to an average of
only 2.1 % per year, considerably below the rate of population growth (Table
1.1).



2 -
1.3          Since 1983, successive govemments attempted to deal with
the country's economic problems through a series of stabilization and reform
efforts. The periodic stabilization measures were supported by five
Interrational Monetary Fund (IMF) Standby Arrangements (December 1984,
October 1986, January 1988, September 1989, and December 1991). The
earliest stabilization attempt began in 1983 with the first sharp devaluation of
the sucre in ten years. The Government that took office in 1984 proceeded
to introduce additional stabilization and reform measures to increase the
competitiveness of the economy and re-establish econaomic growth. Just as
these measures were beginning to yield results, the sharp ensuing shocks of
1986 and 1987 placed heavy pressures on the Government to adopt more
expansionary policies during a pre-election period. As a result, the
Government's budget deficit widened to 9.6% of GDP In 1987, inflation
surged to an unprecedented 56% in 1988, and the current account deficit
reached 12% of GDP. During this period, shortages of foreign exchange led
the Governmient to suspend debt service to external creditors, severely
affecting relations with the international financial community.

1.4          The new Govemment that took office in 1988 introduced an
emergency program to control the economy. It also embarked on a cautious
program of structural adjustments to deal with the vulnerability of the
economy to extemal shocks, to cope with an expected decline in oil exports
and to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the productie sectors.
Its first measures were to devalue the sucre once agai-, to double domestic
petroleum prices, to reduce fiscal expenditures, and to raise substantially
public utility rates.



"3-
1.5       In 1989, after indications that the economy had begun to
stabilize, the Government dismantled some of the Import controls and
adopted a comprehensive tax reform that standardized tax treatment, reduced
marginal tax rates, and reduced the possibility of tax evasion. It also
embarked on a three year trade liberalization program by sharply reducing
tariffs and quantitative restrictions. Finally, it resumed partial interest
payments to commercial creditors and settled all of its X tears to official
creditors. These economic measures made it possible t. x. vtrol the non-
financial public sector fiscal deficit, which declined, on an accrual basis, to
1.0% of GDP in 1989 and showed a small surplus in 1990. The rate of
inflation decelerated to 49% in 1990, after having reached a peak of close to
100% annual rate during the first few months of 1990. Concurrently, the
current account deficit improved and foreign exchange reserves increased.
1.6         Despite the partial success of the stabilization measures, the
uneven pace of reforms of the last few years has led io a very slow recovery.
Ever since the reconstruction following the earthquake the economy has
failed to show any sustained progress. Even in 1990, when the price of oil
surged during the second half of the year, the economy grew at the moderate
pace of 2.3% per year. The pace of reforms was derailed in 1990 by
electoral setbacks and the Government's loss of its Congressional majority.
Strong opposition to the policies being followed led to a temporary
suspension of some important measures such as the periodic adjustment of
domestic petroleum prices and the prices of other publicly provided goods,
and to the postponement of the introduction of reforms that required
legislative approval. Despite these difficulties, the Government maintained
the thrust of its macroeconomic policies by continuing to control expenditures
and to curtail tVe. provision of public credit.
1.7         Throughout 1991, the Government attempted to secure the
support of the international financial community for its policies, while trying
to negotiate an external agreement with its commercial creditors. Both of
these actions were viewed as essential for restoring confidence on the part of
both domestic and foreign investors. In order to obtain an IMF agreement
and reschedule its debt with bilateral creditors, the authorities once again
introduced stabilization measures in September 1991 by increasing the
domestic price of petroleum products by 25% and by reestablishing the
monthly adjustment of prices. These measures were reinforced by other
policies including the elimination of subsidies to exporters, further
liberalization of interest rates, increase in telephone tariffs, some labor
market liberalization, the adoption of equal treatment of foreign investment,
and removal of restrictions on profit remittances. During 1991, the economy
grew at a respectable 4.4%, thanks to a surge in the country's most
important export items: bananas and shrimps.



-4 -
1.8         Fiscal discipline, however, suffered during the months
preceding the presidential election of August 1992. The expansion of public
sector spending was financed by drawing down foreign exchange resesves,
which declined from US$760 million at the beginning of the year to US$258
million in August. With the decline in reserves, severity liquidity problems
arose in the financial markets. Liquidity constraints and the contractionary
effect of the stabilization measures had a recessionary effect on real economic
activity. Economic growth in 1992 was 3.7%, barely keeping in line with
population growth, and it was estimated that the public sector deficit would
reach 7% of GDP.
1.9         A new administration took office in August 1992 with a
mandate to reduce inflation, modernize the economy and reform the public
sector. It introduced a package of measures in ea.ly September designed to:
reduce the fiscal deficit, eliminate any monetary growth associated with it,
regain foreign exchange reserves and provide a nominal anchor (through the
fixed exchange rate) that would condition inflationary expectations.
1.10        In early 1993, the Government idendfied a macroeconomic
program that would solidify stabilization gains and by April 1993, an
agreement with the IMF on a stabilization program covering 1993-1994, was
very advanced. The agreement should establish the basis for both, continued
progress towards improved macroeconomic conditions and for negotiations on
a resolution of the external debt problems of Ecuador.
B. The Government's Reform Program
Macroeconomic Adjustment.
1.11        The stabilization measures taken in September 1992 included:
(i) an increase in average domestic petroleum prices by over 100% (to
roughly international levels), which was expected to improve macroeconomic
efficiency and increase revenue by an estimated 5% of GDP on an annual
basis; (ii) increase in average electricity prices by over 90%, which would
yield 1.2% of GDP on annual basis; (iii) an increase in telephone and water
tariffs by 40%; (iv) a one time tax on assets of companies; (v) reduction in
public spending; and (vi) the elimination or consolidation of 14 autonomous
entities. In addition, the Government fully liberalized lending interest rates,
reduced reserve requirements and devalued the official commercial exchange
rate by 34%.
1.12        The initial impact of the measures was, predictably, a sharp
increase in inflation and interest rates. The twelve month rate of inflat )n



-5-
peaked at 66% in October 1992, but dropped to 55% in February and to an
average of 25% during the first quarter of 1993. Lending interest rates
increased to 100% and dropped subsequently to an average of 52% during
the same period. The decline in interest rates reflected the rise in liquidity in
the financial markets generated by the increase in reserves held by the
Central Bank, following the measures. The measures helped to lower the
combined public sector deficit to 2.5% of GDP, instead of the predicted 7%.
1.13        The Government is well aware that achieving stabilization must
remain the major objective of macroeconomic policy in the short run. To
this effect, the Govemment is having discussions with the IMF on an
economic program aimed at consolidating the adjustment effort. The
program has the following objectives: (i) reduce inflation to 25% in 1993 and
around 12% in 1994; (ii) increase reserves by US$175 million in 1993 and
US$355 million in 1994; and (iii) achieve real GDP growth of about 2% in
1993 and 5% in 1994. These objectives will be achieved through fiscal
policies that would generate a substantial primary surplus; moderation in
wage settlements; maintenance of market-deterrnined interest and exchange
rates; implementation of further structural reforms; and reaching agreement
with Ecuador's foreign creditors on a comprehensive debt restructuring that
would bring the debt burden to a manageable level.
1.14        Beyond the maintenance of macroeconomic control, the current
Government intends to continue with its structural reform program in order
to prepare Ecuador for the challenges posed by the process of international
economic integration currently under way. Under the new strategy, the
economy is expected to grow at rates above the 1980s average, returning
closer to its historical trend. The sources of growth would arise from greater
oil production, expanding non-oil experts, as a result of exchange rate and
trade liberalization policies, and greater productivity of investment, as a
result of the shift from the public to the private sector and away from
inefficient import substitution manufacturing activities. The financial and
trade reform programs are analyzed in some detail in Chapters II and III.
Structural Changes.
1.15        The authorities are convinced that the development model of
the 1970's has been exhausted, and that Ecuador must pursue policies that
will result in a more dynamic, diversified and competitive economy. The
Government has, therefore, embarked on a program of structural reforms
aimed at reducing the role of the public sector in the economy and improving
the investment climate through the reduction of labor market rigidities,



-6 -
facilitating foreign investment, liberalizing the trade regime, and reforming
the financial sector.
1.16        Public Sector Ref_rm. During the 1970's, the Government
significantly increased its role in t}!e economy and embarked on a deficit-
financed expansion of aggregate demand that resulted in large increases in
both budget and current account deficits, made larger by low levels of non-
oil taxation and major implicit subsidies to domestic consumers of petroleum
products. Until 1982, these deficits were financed by readily available
external credits. Faced with reduced oil revenues and lower levels of
external financing, the previous Govermment initiated a reform program in
1988 to reduce spending and broaden the tax base. However, the most
important step in initiating the reform of the state was taken with the
approval by Congress. in November 1992, of a new Budget Law that brings
under executive control 50% of public spending that previously was largely
outside the budget. This law provides the basis for better budgetary
management and reform of the public sector, such as the reduction in public
employment. To implement its program of state reform, the Government has
recently submitted to Congress a Modernization of the State Law covering:
(i) restructuring; (ii) decentralization; and (iii) privatization of public
enterprises. This law will grant authority to the Executive to proceed with
the sale of several of the 167 public enterprises. It also introduces a program
of voluntary retirement for public employees.
1.17        The role of the state in the financial sector has been reduced,
first, through the drastic reduction of subsidized Central Bank lending and,
later, through the New Monetary Regime Law approved in May 1992, which
restructured the BCE, converting it into an exclusively reserve bank,
eliminating its financial intermediation role. The Government has also
initiated the restiucturing of other government financial institutions,
including: Corporaci6n Financiera Nacional, the borrower of this proposed
loan, Banco del Estado (formerly BEDE), the Housing Bank (BEV) and the
National Development Bank (BNF). The restructuring of these banks
involves staff reductions and the sale of equity shares that these banks have
in other enterprises.
C. Investment Climate
1.18        The Government has taken a number of important measures to
improve the environment for private sector development. Besides striving to
achieve macroeconomic stability, a prerequisite for sustained private sector
growth, and liberalize the trade and financial sectors, Congress has approved
a number of new laws to reduce labor market rigidities, liberalize the foreign
investment regime, rationalize mining operations, and facilitate exports.



-7 -
The Government has also plans to modify the Companies Law to ease the
requirements for the formation or liquidation of enterprises and equity based
financing.
1.19         Labor Legislation Reform. Measures have been taken to
reduce labor market rigidities, a major disincentive to investment. Labor
laws were amended in mid-1990 to allow greater flexibility in work contracts
to export industries. These changes made it easier for employers to hire and
fire part-time workers. Also, the right to amend the minimum wage was
taken away from Congress and given to the President. A new Labor Law
was approved by Congress in November 1991 that: (i) recognizes piece work
and payment (by day, week or month); (ii) permits apprentice contracts with
remunerations below the minimum wage (75%); (iii) prevents increases in
labor stability through collective contracts or executive decree; (iv) increases
from 15 to 30 the number of workers in a firm needed to form a trade union;
(v) limits the right to strike for workers in institutions and enterprises of
public interest (vi) accelerates procedures to resolve collective conflicts; and
(vii) regulates solidarity strikes, forbidding their use to obtain concessions
and limiting their duration to three working days. The new law also requires
strikers to give prior notice and obtain the approval of the Ministry of Labor
for any solidarity strike.
1.20         Creation and Liquidation of Companies. The Government is
in the process of reducing the paper work and time spent in the registration
and liquidation of companies. A report by the Superintendency of
Companies shows that the registration of a company used to take, at least,
31 working days-'. When the new procedures are implemented, it will take
8 days to register a company. To reduce the time involved in registering a
company, the Superintendency of Companies has issued a resolution limiting
the number of days involved in processing applications. It has also improved
the coordination with the Producers Associations, Municipalities and the
Ministry of Finance to reduce to 24 hours the time necessary for each agency
to provide the users with the relevant documents. The Government is
discussing reforms to the Registrar Law and Civil Code to eliminate
duplication in registration of companies between the Superintendency of
Companies and the Mercantile Registrar. The Government is also studying a
draft "Companies Law" that will further reduce the registration requirements
1/ The steps to register a manufacturing firm are as follows: (i) review of constitution scripture and issuing of
resolution by the Superintendency of Companies: 5 working days; (ii) registration in Producers Association: 1 to
3 working days; (iii) registration of company scripture in the Mercantile or Property Registrar: 8 working days;
(iv) notarization: 1 or 2 days; (v) press publication: I or 2 days; (vi) registration in Municipality: I day; (vii)
inscription of nominations in the Mercantile Registrar: 8 days; (viii) registration in the Tax Payers Registrar--
Ministry of Finance: I or 2 days.



-8-
for creating, expanding or liquidating companies to one step, except for the
companies that emit obligations, which will be regulated by the Capital
Markets Law.
1.21        Foreign Investment Regulation. In mid-1991, the Government
liberalized the foreign investment regime (Decree 25,01). The new
regulation: (i) provided equal treatment for national and foreign corporations
in terms of tariffs, taxes and other fiscal incentives; (ii) eliminated limits to
repatriation of net profits (from its prior ceiling of 40% of the corporation's
capital base; (iii) allowed foreign investmc. t in previously closed sectors
including utilities, the mass media, advertising and domestic transportation;
and (iv) reduced the requirement of registering investment with the Central
Bank to only a formality. In January 1993, the new administration further
liberalized foreign investment regulations (Decree 415) eliminating remaining
restrictions on foreign investment in commercial banking and extending to
foreign firms the promotional mechanisms available to Ecuadorean firms
under the Cartagena Agreement. The new decree allows foreign investors
and firms to become local investors without registering or meeting specific
qualifications and eliminates prior authorization for the transfer of equity
shares. Regulations have been eased also on technology transfer. The
Government intends to encourage private and foreign investment in the
petroleum sector by amending the Hydrocarbons Law. Former restrictive
foreign investment regulations may account for the low level of foreign
investment in Ecuador, which totalled only US$1.4 billion in 1990.
1.22        Mining Law. A new Mining Law, approved by Congress in
May 1991, defines and organizes the handling of exploration and mining
concessions in an orderly manner, allows them to be real property, and
introduces a better organized geographical demarcation of such areas. It
provides for equal treatment of national and foreign investors, penali.-es
illegal and illicit mining and clearly sets out obligations of title holders and
the government, and limits government discretion. Most importantly, the
new Law establishes a firm base for environmental control of mining
operations. The Bank assisted in the preparation of this law in the context of
a proposed technical assistance operation.
D. Environmental Issues
1.23        Ecuador faces a broad range of resource management and
environmental issues. For lack of a national strategy to incorporate the
environmental dimension in development plans and policies, investment
programs are executed without analysis of potentially adverse environmental
impacts, and natural resources are exploited by employing technologies that
increase potential and actual damage to the environment. The institutional



-9 -
and legal infrastructure to deal with these issues is inadequate: laws and
regulations to protect the environment are inconsistent and incomplete and the
units in charge of natural resource management are spread among various
ministries and semiautonomous entities, with limited resources and untrained
staff. There is a growing consensus in Ecuador on the need to protect the
environment and improve the management of the country's natural resources.
A Congressional Commission on Environment is currently considering a draft
of a new Environmental Protection Law, and several Subsecretariats for
Environment have been created under the Ministries of Mines and Energy,
Agriculture, and Transport. A Bank mining loan, under preparation, would
support the authorities' ability to implement new mining legislation that
ensures environmentally appropriate techniques in mining. A Bank project
for Environment Management and Technical Assistance, also under
preparation, would help strengthen the general institutional and regulatory
framework for environmental management.
II. FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
A. Evolution and Structure
2.1         The main institutions in Ecuador's financial system are the
Central Bank (BCE), 31 private commercial bar.ks--28 of which are locally
owned--with about 285 branches; three state banks--the National
Development Bank (BNF), the Ecuadorean Housing Bank (BEV), and the
Ecuadorean Development Bank (BEDE); and 10 development finance
companies (DFCs) including the publicly owned Corporaci6n Financiera
Nacional (CFN). There are also 9 leasing companies, 11 savings and loan
associations, more than 28 insurance companies, and various currency
exchange offices and securities exchanges in Guayaquil and Quito. The
Social Security Institute is also a major depositor of financial savings as well
as a mortgage lender. Policy-makdng agencies include the Monetary Board,
BCE and the Superintendency of Banks (SB). The Monetary Board sets
exchange rates, interest rates and other financial policies implemented by the
BCE and the SB. The BCE also provides credit to financial intermediaries.
The SB supervises and audits financial intermediaries and publishes statistical
information on the banking system.
2.2         By the mid-1980's, the performance of the financial sector in
Ecuador had revealed several weaklesses from the point of view of resource
allocation, institutional strength, and mobilization of domestic resources for
long-term lending. These problems dated back to the 1970s, when the
financial system grew rapidly, mainly because of the availability of external

market by improving the conditions for adjustable rate lending and reducing
the tax bias against equity finance.
2.5         The implementation of the program was delayed as a result of
mounting financial distress which stemmed from the oil price collapse in
1986, the earthquake of March 1987, and a change in Government. The
major problem was accelerating inflation fueled by the use of monetary
emission to finance the growing fiscal deficit. The new Government
inaugurated in August 1988 took immediate action to stabilize the economy
and reached agreement on a new IMF stand-by program. The partial success
of the stabilization measures allowed the Government to implement the
financial sector reform program during 1989-92 in a more stable
macroeconomic environment. Important measures were taken to liberalize
interest rates and reduce the financial intermediation role of the Central
Bank. The new Government inaugurated in August 1992 advanced further
the reform of the financial sector by fully liberalizing interest rates, reducing
reserve requirements and introducing the auction of government securities to
regulate the liquidity of the financial system. The financial role of public
banks is being redefined and curtailed. CFN has been transformed into a
second-tier bank; BNF will not receive more Government funds and will be
allowed to operate only with its own recovered funds; The BEV has instituted
a program for cost and personnel reduction and will be converted into a
second-tier bank.
Strengthening of Financial Institutions.
2.6         The measures taken to improve the capital adequacy of
financial institutions included: (i) a Monetary Board regulation setting
minimum ratios of capital to assets for all banks; (ii) a SB regulation
establishing provisions as a function of portfolio quality; (iii) development of
a monitoring system for financial institutions including indices of portfolio
quality, risk, liquidity, capital adequacy, and profitability; (iv) a SB
regulation prohibiting distribution of profits by financial institutions not
complying with required provisions and minimum ratios of capital to
assets;     (v) introduction of yearly portfolio quality inspections by the
SB to determine required provisions; (vi) quality control of independent
auditors by the SB; and (vii) improvements in the quality of SB supervision
through personnel training.
2.7         Based on an in-depth analysis of the more seriously
undercapitalized institutions, five banks, three DFCs and one short-term
finance company were deemed non-viable and were liquidated. Banks that
had insufficient provisions for doubtful loans by December 31, 1988, were
given 5 years to comply with the new regulations (the adopted regulations



- 12 -
follow the recommendations of the Basle Committee, including a capital to
assets ratio of approximately 8%). Compliance would be achieved through
the provision of at least 10% of the identified deficiency every 6 months.
Although initially most of the banks and DFCs had substantial provisioning
deficiencies, all of them had covered their position by December 1990, three
years before the maximum time allowed. Banks and DFCs were given until
December 1991 to fill the capital deficiencies identified by December 31,
1988 (these had to be covered: 20% in 1989, 30% in 1990 and 50% in
1991). Regularization with respect to capital adequacy has proceeded more
slowly, and by June 1991 many of the local banks still presented deficiencies.
As a result of the above policies and of the inflation-induced reduction in the
value of loans, the situation of financial institutions has improved markedly.
2.8         Technical assistance provided to the SB under the FSAL, has
helped make it into one of the strongest in Latin America. The strengthened
regulatory framework and the improved financial situation of a number of
financial institutions would contribute significantly to the success of the
proposed financial intermediation operation. However, the SB requires
further strengthening to expand its supervision and enforcement efforts to
financial groups and other financial institutions such as savings and loan and
leasing companies.
Interest Rate Policy
2.9         In the mid-1980s, the Government took initial steps to
liberalize interest rates. Among the most important measures taken was the
introduction, in 1985, of freely floating rates, following a long standing
tradition of fixed rates. Specific measures were: (i) creation of a Certificate
of Deposit (CD, called P6liza de Acumulaci6n) with a freely determined
interest rate; (ii) introduction of adjustable rates on loans with resources from
the BCE or international institutions; (iii) subsequent freeing of interest rates
on all deposit instruments (except demand deposits): and (iv) increased
interest rates on BCE credit. The introduction of a market determined
variable CD rate raised financial savings, although the share of CDs in total
deposits was only slightly higher in November 1992 than in December 1987.

2.10         Interest rate liberalization in 1985 allowed interest rates to
become positive in real terms, except for periods of unexpected inflationary
outbursts. The CD rate is the rate most representative of the cost of funds of
financial intermediaries. This rate has been mostly positive since the second
half of 1990. Savings deposits, on the other hand, received on average a
nominal rate of close to 29%, well below inflation, which may be the result
of the monopsonic positions of some banks in certain geographical areas
and/or the preference for keeping liquid assets on the part of a large number
of small depositors. Another factor could be regulations that reduced banks'
incentives for mobilizing deposits, such as the obligation to invest part of
their deposits in forced investments that had below market yields.
2.11         In August 1988, the Government introduced a ceiling of 19
percentage points on spreads between passbook saving rates and lending
rates. In April 1989 the system of spreads was modified by allowing
commercial banks to set their lending rate at 15 percentage points above a
reference base equal to the arithmetic average of the 90 day CD rate and
their respective passbook savings rate. Other financial institutions, which did
not issue savings deposits or CDs, had to set their lending rates at up to 17
percentage points above the arithmetic average of the reference base of all
domestic commercial banks. Average annualized lending rates of the
banldng system for non-preferential loans have been consistently positive
since early 1990.
2.12         Despite the ceiling on spreads, progress was made in interest
rate liberalization. Since 1989 subloans of foreign long term funds to large
industries were priced at the commercial rates. These rates are automatically
variable throughout the lives of the subloans. In December 1989, in the



- 14 -
context of the Fourth SSE Project (Loan 3162-EC), the Govemment agreed
with the Bank on a formula to adjust the interest rate of preferential loans
every six months, to reach the commercial rates by June 1992. In May
1991, the Monetary Board allowed loans for SSE to be priced at the
commercial rate, advancing by one year the adjustment agreed with the Bank.
Moreover, in July 1991 rates on loans with BCE funds were made market
determined by linldng them to the lowest reference rate (average of CD plus
savings) of the banking system plus 15 points (except for FODERUMA, a
fund for small agricultural growers that charges an interest rate of 47%).
Preferential loans from commercial banks' forced investments have been
drastically reduced and are now priced at the commercial lending rate.
2.13        Still, the ceiling on spreads had the effect of directing the
banking business towards less controlled activities such as leasing, growth of
the overnight market and an increase of resource mobilization for off-shore
operations. Also, distortions were created by the practice of some banks of
issuing small amounts in CDs at very high interest rates to be able to
increase their average lending rates. During negotiations, the Government
agreed to liberalize further lending interest rates by eliminating the formula
linking maximum lending rates to average cost of funds.
2.14        In September 1992, under the new administration, the
Monetary Board eliminated the formula linking lending rates to the cost of
funds for loans made by financial institutions with their own resources.
Since then, borrowers and lenders are free to agree on the lending rate of a
particular operation. After an initial increase in lending rates following the
measures (the average lending rate in August 1992 reached 90%), interest
rates dropped to an average of 52% in January 1993, with interest rates paid
on 90 day CDs dropping also to an average of 40%. In January 1993, the
Monetary Board took additional steps to facilitate long-term lending by
adopting a system of market determined reference interest rates. These
reference rates, published periodically by the BCE, are weighted averages of
the market interest rates on deposits and credits. By specifying a margin--in
percentage points--above or below a selected reference rate, banks and their
clients can now have a market determined system for adjusting interest rates
over time.

Auction of Government Paers and Reserve Requirements.
2.15          An important step towards the modernization of the financial
sector has been the introduction by the BCE, since December 1992, of
several new instruments to improve its management of monetary policy
including open market operations, periodic auction of open market securities
and the operation of a modern money desk for daily transactions.
Previously, any buyer could buy government stabilization bonds at a prefixed
price and predetermined interest rate, which impeded the development of a
secondary market. The auction of government securities allows the market to
establish a floor rate over the basis of "zero risk". This, in turn, will allow
other rates to be adjusted to this reference rate, according to the riskiness and
length of the operation. Also, the auction gives the BCE the basis to
influence the liquidity of the financial system through open market operations
and reduce its reliance on direct measures such as changes in reserve
requirements. The adoption of the auction system for government securities
has been complemented with reductions in reserve requirements from 34% to
32% in September 1992 and to 28% in February 1993.

Central Bank Credit
2.16        In the context of the FSAL, the Government sharply reduced
BCE credits, increased rates on these credits, and reduced the number of
separate lines under which this credit is provided from 44 to 22. The
outstanding credit of the BCE to the financial system dropped from a peak of
19% of GDP in 1984 to 2.4% in 1990. The stock of BCE loans to the
financial system in 1990 decreased in real terms to about 14% of the 1984
level and will further decrease in 1991 to 10% of the 1984 level. As a
result, the proportion of the banks' portfolios financed with their own
resources, increased from 66% in 1988 to 75% in mid-1990.
2.17        The reduction of the financial intermediation role of the BCE
has been more significant with respect to loans to private rather than to
public financial institutions. The result is that the stock of BCE credits to
three government financial institutions: BNF, BEV and CFN, increased in
relative terms. Since most of this credit has been at subsidized rates, these
institutions were favored at the expense of private banks, which have to carry
in their monetary liabilities the costs of the reserve requirements tnat permit
BCE lending. The New Monetary Regime Law, approved by Congress in
May 1992, reformed the BCE, eliminating its financial intermediation role.
Under this law, provision of credit to financial institutioi.s by the BCE is
restricted to the need to cover such institutions' temporary liquidity needs.
The New Monetary Regime Law also creates the State Bank as the depository
for public sector accounts. The new Government intends to amend the
Monetary Regime Law to maintain the public sector deposits in the BCE and
to ensure that the State Bank does not provide subsidized credit to the
financial sector. The proposed operation would help reduce pressures to
reinitiate BCE lending in two ways: (i) by supporting the conversion of CFN
into a second-tier bank, independent of BCE credit; and (ii) by increasing the
availability of market priced term credit, which would reduce the pressure on
BCE to provide more rediscounts.
Forced Investments.
2.18        The obligation of commercial banks to place part of their
portfolio in forced investments increased the cost of other bank loans and
caused distortions in both the financial and goods markets. The Government
has reduced or eliminated most forced investments. The main forced
investments of private banks were: (i) the obligation to provide credits for
agriculture and small scale enterprises. This forced investment was greatly
reduced from the equivalent of 10% of the banks' commercial portfolio to
1% in May 1991, and the interest rate of these loans was made market



- 17 -
determined; (ii) the obligation for the banks to keep at least 5 % of their
capital and reserves in shares of the BCE, which paid no more than 12% in
deMdends. The restructuring of the BCE, under the new Monetary Regime
Law, eliminated the requirement of commercial banks to subscribe shares of
the BCE; and (iii) the obligation to acquire BEV bonds at their nominal
value--which give a yield of only 10%--for an amount equal to 10% of the
banks' savings deposits (excluding reserve requirement). The new law for
public banks that the Government will present to Congress, as part of a
package of financial laws, contemplates the restructuring of BEV into a
second-tier mortgage bank, and the elimination of the requirement that
commercial banks subscribe BEV bonds. To ensure maintenance of these
policies, loan commitments would be conditioned to: (i) maintaining the
policy to reduce in real terms the stock of BCE direct credit to financial
institutions, from 1993 onwards, except to cover banks' temporary liquidity
problems; and (ii) freezing or reducing the obligation of commercial banks to
place 1 % of their deposits in finaneial funds.
Term Credit Under Inflationary Conditions.
2.19        Ecuador does not have a mechanism of indexation for term
credits, despite several years of high inflation. With nominal rates of over
50%, borrowers are forced to undertake an accelerated repayment of the real
principal of their term loans, which creates a cash flow problem, particularly
for enterprises with new projects (in real terms most of the loan is repaid in
the first two years, while later repayments are minimal in real terms).
Possible solutions to this problem are: (i) indexation of the loans to the
exchange rate, (ii) indexation of the loans to the CPI, and (iii) capitalization
of interest or granting of "new loans" to cover the debt service. All three
options have some problems. The first option could be viable for exporters,
but is seen as too risky by producers of non-tradeables. The second option
could invite wage earners to demand wage indexation. Both, the second and
third options face legal problems, since it is currently illegal in Ecuador to
pay interest on interest (anatocism). Demand for the proposed loan could be
adversely affected if inflation remains high and no indexation or interest
capitalization scheme is adopted. To address this problem, the Government
agreed with the Bank to include in the New Monetary Regime Law a
provision to make legal the capitalization of the inflation component of
interests in medium and long term loans. Although the Law allows the
capitalization of interests only during the grace period, the Government has
agreed to review with the Bank, one year after loan effectiveness, the
convenience of extending the capitalization of interests to the amortization
period.

C. Demand for Term Finance
2.20         The economic downturn that started in 1982 was accompanied
by a sharp reduction in the level of gross fixed investment. During 1983-
1989, the average level of gross capital formation was 20% to 25% lower
than that of the 1976-1982 period. Particularly dramatic has been the
reduction in imports of machinery and transport equipment which were, on
average, 40% lower in US dollars during the 1983-1989 period than in the
previous seven years. Aggregate fixed investment by medium and large
private enterprises supervised by the Superintendency of Companies (about
16,000 companies) averaged around US$600 million pef year during the
1985-1989 period. About one fourth of this investment was financed by the
firm's own resources and the rest (about US$430 million per year) by credit
provided by the financial system, mostly in the form of short term loans.
The level of investment in fixed assets in 1989, however, was well below the
period's average (US$384 million). Supply of credit (domestic and external)
declined also, with term credit unavailable at any price.

2.21         An increase in investment demand is expected for the 1993-95
period, as a result of the stabilization and structural adjustment efforts. A
conservative estimate of investment in fixed assets can be made assuming that
investment will gradually recover from the drop suffered in 1989, to reach by



- 19-
1995 the average level of the 1984-1989 period. Under this assumption, total
credit requirement of the private companies could reach US$1,500 million for
the 1993-1995 period. Of this amount, about US$1,100 million would be
required by productive enterprises in manufacturing, agriculture, mining and
transport. These estimates are broadly confirmed by two independent
surveys of credit demand from manufacturing enterprises carried out by
independent consultants during the preparation of this operation (involving
184 and 152 firms respectively), and by the project pipeline of financial
institutions active in term lending. All these sources provide evidence that
tere are concrete investment projects in manufacturing totalling about
US$400 million for the next four years, and that they would require about
US$200 million in credit from the financial system. These are mostly
projects for expansion and modernization of existing operationis.
2.22        A recent survey among 8 out of 16 banks that have been pre-
qualified by CFN to have access to CFN's loans indicates that these banks
expect to lend a total of US$126.3 million from the proposed project in the
next two years, of which US$60.7 would be in aollars to exporting firms that
earn revenues in US dollars. This is equivalent to 48% of their expected
project loan portfolio. CFN estimates that the total demand of dollar loans to
exporting firms by the 16 banks already qualified to participate in the project,
could be at least US$135 million in t&e next two years. This figure could be
higher if some of the additional 14 b: iks that have requested participation in
the line qualify.

D. Provision of Long-Term Financing
The Banking Sector.
2.23          The far-reaching financial reforms implemented in Ecuador
have not yet led to a significant extension in the maturity of domestic
financial resources. A large percentage of financial intermediation in
Ecuador is don'- through transactions of no more than 90 days. Financial
institutions do .,iake loans at 180 days with their own resources, but this is
uncommon. There is medium-term intermediation (at three to five years)
with: (i) funds from the BCE and the IlESS, which rediscount instruments
issued by banks; and (ii) funds from international organizations.



- 21 -
2.24         Lack of term finance is the result of economic instability, high
levels of inflation, and lack of a mechanism of monetary correction that
would reduce the interest rate risks of lenders and borrowers and reduce the
impact of high nominal interest rates on borrowers stemming from
prepayment of principal. On the other hand, negative real deposit interest
rates for some recent years have reduced the level of resource mobilization.
It is no surprise, therefore, that despite negative real interest rates, nearly
one-third of total investment in industrial fixed assets between 1983 and 1988
was financed with equity and owner's loans; while long-term loans from the
financial sector, including the capital market, accounted for only 12%.
Banks play a more significant role in financing incremental working capital.
During the same period, incremental short-term loans were equivalent to
63% of these firms' total incremental working capital needs.

The Capital Market
2.25         The capital market remains extremely underdeveloped. The
stock market (both shares and securities) is very thin. Transactions in the
stock exchanges of Quito and Guayaquil in 1992 amounted to only US$160
million, and less than one percent of the amounts transacted was in shares.
The most actively traded instruments are: promissory notes, mortgage bonds,
government bonds, letters of exchange, and BCE bonds. The transactions of
some of these instruments are dominated by the IESS and the BCE. Since
these institutions unilaterally determine the price of their securities, many of



- 22 -
the operations in the stock exchange are not really negotiated. This situation
has stimulated the development of a substantial unregulated market.
2.26        The capital market's limited development is in part the result
of the same problems that have prevented the development of term lending.
There are, however, other factors that have contributed to this situation. On
the demand side, the availability of subsidized credits from the financial
system acted as a disincentive for enterprises to issue shares or direct
obligations; and the absence of an adequate legal framework, accountancy
norms and proper supervision reduced the incentives of investors. On the
supply side, the market has been constrained by excessive regulations,
limitation of maximum interest rates on securities, the ownership structure of
a large number of enterprises characterized by a closed family structuie not
interested in disclosing financial information, and a tax structure that
discriminated against investments in shares compared to bonds and against
bonds compared to bank deposits.
2.27        In recognition of these deficiencies, since the early 1980s,
Ecuadorean governments have developed programs to improve the securities
market. The tax reform supported by the FSAL reduced the tax bias against
bonds. And, in July 1991, the Monetary Board freed interest rates on
securities issued by financial and non-financial institutions. The Government
has prepared a draft "Capital Market Law" and intends to present it to
Congress during the first quarter of 1993, together with proposed
modifications to the Companies Law. Initial versions of this draft law were
developed with the assistance of IFC and of the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission of the USA. The draft law establishes the creation of
brokerage houses which would be the owners of the Stock Exchange and
would negotiate for third parties or on their own. Banks would be allowed to
operate in the Stock Exchange through subsidiaries constituted as brokerage
houses. A Securities Commission would be established for regulating and
promoting the development of a securities market, centralize information and
investigate and discipline violators to the norms.
III. TRADE POLICY ISSUES
A. Introduction
3.1          Like many other Latin American countries, Ecuador adopted
an import substitution industrialization model in the 1950s, relying on both
import and export restrictions. Its many import restrictions have included
tariffs, surcharges, and other tariff-equivalent costs; prohibitions and prior



- 23 -
authorizations (QRs); and intricate import procedures21. Exports have been
discouraged chiefly by direct export as well as import restrictions and by
complicated export procedures. In February 1990, the Government
announced a program to address trade policy issues. Despite difficulties in
achieving macroeconomic stability, the major aspects of the program were
implemented as planned. The new Government that took office in August
1992, took further actions to liberalize the trade regime by reaching free
trade agreements with the other Andean Pact countries and accepting the
common external tariff agreed by the Andean Pact with a schedule of tariffs
between 5% and 20% (except for motor vehicles which face a tariff of 40%).
B. The Trade Reform Program
3.2          The trade policy reform program has three fundamental
components: (a) a major reduction in the average level and dispersion of
tariffs, including removal of tariff exonerations; (b) a major removal of QRs
on imports and exports; and (c) a simplification of import and export
procedures. The Government has enacted much of this program between
1990 and 1992. The following paragraphs describe these policy changes in
detail.
Reduction of Import Tariffs and Surcharges
3.3         At the end of 1989, tariffs ranged from 0% to 290%.
Additional surcharges ranged from 0% to 48% and included a 30% surcharge
on a list of luxury imports, a so-called "stabilization" surcharge (5%, 8%, or
15%, depending on the import list), and other minor surcharges. The
implied effective protection rates ranged widely; from about -260% to about
600% (see Table 2 in Annex V). However, domestic prices seldom exceeded
international prices by more than 50%, suggesting that the extent of tariff
redundancy or "water in the tariffs" was significant. Tariffs were an
important source of Government revenue, accounting for 27% of tax
revenue.
3.4          The tariff structure was further complicated by tariff
exonerations. There were 34 legal bases for exonerating tariffs. These
included, in particular, development laws that granted tariff exonerations on
imported inputs and capital goods to firms in manufacturing and to the
agricultural sector. Tariff exonerations not only contributed to the lack of
transparency of the protective system, but were also a significant hidden tax

No. 8412-EC, Chapter III. See also Table 1 of Annex V, which dercribes tariffs plus surcharges and import
restrictions as of 1989.

an expiration date, which had been reduced to 45% of eligible tariffs in
1986, were further reduced to 40% of eligible tariffs in July, 1990, and to
20% in January 1991. Under the Andean Pact Agreement, all remaining
exonerations will be eliminated altogether with the adoption of the CET.
3.8        The Government has already abolished most other non-tariff
costs. These include import deposits, which were fully phased out in July,
1990 and a requirement that imports of capital goods be funded with long
term loans, which was abolished last year. Advanced payment of tariffs will
be abolished with the changes in import procedures (para. 3.14).
3.9        Although the BCE segments the allocation of official foreign
exchange between the private and public sector, such segmentation has not
been binding thus far. The BCE sells foreign exchange revenues from non-
oil exports to private importers at an exchange rate that has often been
significantly below free market rates. Revenues from oil exports are
restricted to finance government imports, debt service and accumulation of
reserves. However, the ceiling on sales of foreign exchange to private
importers exceeded demand from private importers, partly because demand
was contained by import restrictions. Importers can also legally pay for
imports with foreign exchange purchased in the free market.
Removal of Ouantitative Restrictions
3.10       QRs on imports include prohibitions and prior authorization
requirements. Imports of goods not included on a positive import list are
prohibited. Moreover, several imports require prior authorization from one
or more government agencies. The production coverage of these restrictions
has been quite high. By 1990, 26.4% of import items; 68% of gross
production in manufacturing was covered by QRs. The coverage of QRs was
increased during the balance of payments crises of the early eighties to stem
the drain on BCE foreign reserves. They were reduced moderately in April
1985 and January 1986, but with some reversal over subsequent months.
Since 1986, some prohibited items have been transferred to the prior
authorization list. The production coverage of import QRs was reduced by
more than 50% in early 19°1; and most remaining QRs were removed during
1991. In February 1992, ;he Government rescinded the prohibition to import
motor vehicles. Some prohibitions, however, will remain in effect as
safeguards to national security, health, and environmental protection.
Reduction of Export Restrictions
3.11       Exports have been discouraged chiefly by direct export as well
as import restrictions. On average, import tariffs alone account for a gap of



- 26 -
about 15% between the effective exchange rates for imports and exports.
Import prohibitions, prior authorizations, other import requirements, and
export restrictions further raise this gap. Export restrictions, which include
prohibitions, prior authorizations and quotas, are set quarterly by government
decree. These restrictions aim to provide for environmental protection or
attempt to help regulate the domestic supply of consumer or intermediate
goods. Most of the restrictions apply to primary goods. The Government
has agreed to remove all export restrictions in conjunction with the
privatization of its agricultural food marketing enterprises. In November
1991, Ecuador adopted an antidumping regulation in accordance with the
norms of the Cartagena Agreement.
Export Promotion
3.12       The chief export promotion mechanisms seek to exonerate
exports from tariffs on imported inputs. Under the Industrial Development
Law, th. Government can grant partial exonerations of tariffs on imported
inputs not produced domestically. These partial tariff exonerations are
available to firms engaged in export (100% permanent exoneration) or
import-substituting production (less than 100% exoneration for a limited
number of years). Tariff exonerations conflict with each other and are not
efficient: exonerations on imported inputs for import substitutes discriminate
against exports, while tariff exonerations on imported inputs for exports
reduce the anti-export bias. These exonerations are being abolished (para.
3.7).
3.13       In addition, under Customs Law regulations, firms can store
freely imported inputs for a period of up to 15 months in authorized
warehouses and not pay import duties if the output is exported. The
efficiency of this mechanism is undermined by the exclusion of imported
inputs subject to prohibitions or prior authorizations. This mechanism has
not been extensively used because it requires the beneficiary to meet several
conditions that chiefly seek to control its strong incentive for abuse.
Following approval of the new Custcms Law to be submitted to Congress,
the Government would introduce a system of exonerations that includes: (a)
temporary admission of duty and VAT free inputs; (b) drawback of tariffs
and VAT paid on imported inputs: and (c) duty and VAT-free restitution of
imported inputs used in exports. Ecuador has applied for membership in
GATT.
Simplification of Import and Export Procedures
3.14       Import procedures included several steps and costly
documentation involving several Government agencies. Importers had to



- 27 -
obtain prior authorization from the applicable government agency and then
present evidence of such authorization to the BCE to obtain an import permit.
Since prior overvaluation of the official exchange rate with respect to the free
market rate encouraged importers to use foreign exchange for purposes other
than the authorized import, the BCE designed a number of procedures--
import value guarantees, import deadlines, surrender of shipping documents,
and prior notification of merchandise arrival for inspection--to counteract this
incentive. Furthermore, the BCE undertook its own inspection, duplicating
the customs clearance process.
3.15        Export procedures were also complicated. First, prior
authorization requirements implied that the exporter had to obtain such
authorization in the applicable government agency and then present evidence
of this in the BCE, which must issue an export permit. Second, past
overvaluations of the official exchange rate discouraged exporters from
surrendering all of their foreign exchange earnings. Thus, to counteract this
incentive, the BCE established several requirements, including a foreign
exchange surrender guarantee, export deadlines and fines and foreign
exchange surrender deadlines.
3.16        To complement its reduced trade restrictions, the Government
has simplified trade procedures. Trade procedures seek only a statistical
record of trade, collection of import duties and control of trade restrictions.
The import permit has been regulated as the procedure to obtain information
on trade and approve prices for foreign exchange purposes. Approval of
prices is automatic unless explicitly objected. Importers simply report
information on quantities, prices and country of origiin to the BCE. The BCE
inputs the data into a computerized information system on line with customs
and only objects to prices that are out of line with international quotations.
The customs service assesses the import value and the applicable tariff,
certifies admission of the merchandise (following payment of import duties at
a financial institution) and indicates admission clearance to the BCE. To
facilitate imports, in September 1992 the new administration eliminated the
requirement of obtaining authorization from the BCE to be able to retire
imported merchandise from Customs.
3.17        Similarly, export procedures have been simplified. An "Export
Facilitation and Cargo Reserve Law" that simplifies export procedures was
approved by Congress in March 1992. This law eliminated export licenses
leaving as an only export requirement the registration of the exporter in the
Tax Payers Registrar (Registro Unico de Contribuyentes). Although the
exporter has to submit a report to the BCE indicating export quantities,
values, prices and destination, this is now for statistical reasons. The BCE
verifies prices and inputs data in computerized information system in line



- 28 -
with customs. The exporter ships the merchandise, following customs
verification of export quantities and prices, and surrenders foreign exchange
earnings to the BCE through a financial institution. Customs then issues a
document indicating shipment of the merchandise and also informs the BCE
of the shipment. The "One window" system for import and export
procedures, established by regulation of the Monetary Board in May 1992,
has reduced substantially the paper work for trade operations, allowing
traders to get the required permits in one day. The Export Facilitation Law
also liberalized shipping rules, ending the monopoly of state-owned and
associated foreign ships in the transport of merchandise. Furthermore, the
Government is preparing a new "Ports Law" to modernize the ports and
improve customs administration. Under this law, the private sector could
deliver some services under concession and the private sector would have
more representation in decision making bodies such as the Board of the Sea
Merchant Council.
3.18        To summarize, the third stage of Ecuador's trade reform
program involved: (i) setting tariff levels within the 5%-20% range (except
for motor vehicles); (ii) removal of remaining import and export QRs, except
for a list of exceptions justified by security, health and environmental
concerns; and (iii) simplification of export and import procedures. Given
the importance of the trade liberalization for the success of the loan, to
resume commitments after the mid-term review of economic environment for
private sector development, the Bank will require a positive assessment that
there has been no retrogression in trade reform (para. 6.6).
IV. BANK ASSISTANCE AND STRATEGY
A. Past Lending
4.1         The Bank has approved six DFC loans to Ecuador totalling
US$270 million, net of cancellations between 1970 and 19823'. A PCR
dated June 11, 1985, for the third and fourth DFC projects, showed that the
projects' effectiveness had been limited as a result of the financial
deterioration suffered by the loans' financial intermediaries during the early
3/ First DFC Project, Loan 721-EC, approved December 1970
Second DFC Project, Loan 930-EC, approved June 1973
Third DFC Project, Loan 1359-EC, approved December 1976
Fourth DFC Project, Loan 173 i-EC, approved June 1979
Fifth DFC Project, Loan 2096-EC, approved April 1982
Industrial Finance Project, Loan 2672-EC, approved July 1986



- 29 -
1980s. Similar problems were also found in the Fifth DFC project,
according to the findings of a PCR dated June 30, 1989. On the positive
side, a dialogue on financial matters between the Govemment and the Bank
was opened during the Fifth DFC loan. However, the dialogue did not bear
fruit until the sixth operation in the sector, approved July 1986. This was a
hybrid operation with a US$50 million policy component in support of policy
reforms. This loan was disbursed after the Government introduced a revised
import tariff structure, removed 20% of then-prevailing import prohibitions,
and shifted from fixed rates to variable interest rates for industrial sector
lending. There was also a US$65 million credit component. During joint
negotiations of this and the Third SSE loan, agreement was reached with the
Ecuadorean Governinent to establish a variable interest rate regime for
subloans, and to maintain interest rates on all loans to the industrial sector
with maturities exceeding two years at positive levels in real terms. After
July 1, 1987, the interest rates were also reviewed relative to 90-day
certificate of deposit rates, as agreed with the Bank. The positive interest
rate objectives were not fully accomplished, however, because changes in the
onlending interest rates were not automatically linked to the market reference
rate. Instead, changes were discretionary, requiring issuance of regulations
by the Monetary Board. Non-compliance with interest rate covenants led to
suspension of commitments under this loan. Upon establishment of the new
interest rate regime, the suspension was lifted in May 1989, and by mid-1990
the loan was fully committed.
4.2        In addition, to the DFC operations, the Bank has approved four
small scale enterprise (SSE) loans to Ecuado,4', for US$140.0 million
equivalent. The First SSE loan for US$20.0 million, approved in 1980,
helped to establish the Fund for the Development of Small Industries and
Artisans (FOPINAR) as a second-tier mechanism in CFN. The Second SSE
operation for US$40.0 million, approved in 1982, helped FOPINAR to
expand and consolidate its operations. A PCR dated June 29, 1988
concluded that both loans were effective. The Third SSE loan for US$30.0
million was approved in 1986 and a Fourth SSE loan for US$50.0 million
equivalent was approved in early 1990. During loan negotiations of the
Fourth SSE loan, the Government and the Bank agreed on a formula to
adjust semi-annually preferential lending rates to reach the commercial bank
lending rate by June 1992. The Government has advanced by one year the
compliance with this agreement.
4/ First SSE Project, Loan 1879-EC, approved June 1980
Second SSE Project, Loan 2221-EC, approved December 1982
Third SSE Project, Loan 2673-EC, approved April 1986
Fourth SSE Project, Loan 3162-EC, approved February 1990



- 30 -
4.3        The Bank approved a FSAL (Loan 2897-EC) for US$100.0
million in December 1987, released the first tranche in January 1988, and the
second tranche in December 1989. The objectives of the PSAL program are
detailed in paragraph 2.4. A PCR issued June 1990 concluded that,
although implementation was delayed by deteriorating economic conditions
and a change in government, the operation was successful in achieving its
main objectives.
4.4        Trade issues have also long been the subject of Bank-Country
dialogue. Trade liberalization measures were agreed in the context of former
agricultural and industrial sector and credit operations. The Industrial
Finance loan (Loan 2672-EC), approved in April, 1986, also supported a
significant reduction of tariffs and QRs on imports of industrial products. An
Agricultural Sector Loan (Loan 2626-EC) supported the replacement of QRs
on imports of agricultural outputs and inputs with import tariffs and further
reductions in industrial protection. Although these measures reduced some of
the additional protection that had been implemented in the early 1980s, the
remaining protection was still substantial and some reversals occurred. The
Government that took office in August 1988 indicated its intention to pursue
a trade reform program and its interest in Bank support of that program.
The Bank has maintained an intensive discussion of trade policy issues with
the Government. The policies that this operation would support are
consistent with the recommendations of a trade policy review of Ecuador
completed in 1990 (see footnote N.2).
B. Bank Strategy
4.5        The Bank's country assistance strategy for Ecuador is to help
resume economic growth, improve basic services targeted to the poor, and
respond to the Government's agenda by diversifyi,qg assistance towards
supporting the reform of the public sector and institutional strengthening, the
shift towards private sector-led growth, and the reduction of debt and debt-
service. The Bank's assistance objective would be met through new lending,
economic and sector work, and flexibility in adjusting the existing project
portfolio to the Government's new priorities, timetable and institutional
realities. The proposed operation would be consistent with the Bank's
assistance strategy concerning public sector reform and structural
strengthening through its support of CFN's restructuring into a second-tier
bank. Also, consistent with the strategy of supporting private sector-led
growth, the proposed operation would support Government actions in
liberalizing financial markets and trade and investment regimes by meeting
the longer term credit needs of private enterprises, especially those with an
export orientation. The proposed project would help consolidate progress



- 31 -
already achieved in these policy areas by conditioning continuous access to
the loan to the maintenance of the reforms.
c. ICSrae
4.6        IFC's operations have been historically constrained by the
availability of subsidized credit in sucres in the local financial system. Total
IFC exposure to Ecuador is only US$13 million; including a US$10 million
approved by IFC in 1992. IFC's strategy is to: (i) promote export-oriented
projects where the country has comparative advantages (agroindustry, fishing,
mining, oil and gas); provide advisory services for the privatization of public
companies; and promote joint ventures with multinational sponsors in light of
the large size of oil and gas projects, zs well as Andean Pact expectations.
D. Lessons Learned From Other Projects
4.7        The design of this proposed loan has taken into account lessons
learned from financial intermediation loans and trade and financial sector
adjustment loans in Ecuador and other countries in the LAC region in the last
ten years. The lessons learned come from PCRs, PPARs, as well as from
supervision reports of some ongoing operations. Some of the lessons are
country specific but, for the most part, they are common to credit line
operations and policy-based loans. The most important lessons learned
concern the institutional arrangements, the onlending mechanisms, the policy
conditionality and the legal agreements.
4.8        Institutional Arrangements. A major lesson of previous
operations in the region is that the Bank should not lend through government
banks that operate as first-tier banks or that have extensive equity investments
in government or mixed companies. In most cases where the saenp
government bank acted as both first and second-tier lender, unavoidable
conflicts of interest have seriously interfered with the working of the
operation. Also, for the most part, the Bank has failed to convert these
banks into effective financial institutions, independent from Central Bank
funding and free from political influence on their lending activities. Even
carefully drafted statements on policies and procedures, and financial
covenants to monitor their performance, have been unable to prevent them
from falling into serious financial troubles as a result of excessive exposure
to loans and guarantees to state enterprises and the low quality of their loan
portfolio to the private sector. This operation would avoid these problems by
requiring CFN to become a second-tier bank without direct lending activities
and to limit its equity investments to agreed minimum levels.



- 32 -
4.9         Onlending Mechanism. An important lesson from past credit
line operations is the need to reduce or eliminate the project appraisal role of
the second-tier bank and to streamline the approval and disbursement
procedures, shifting the emphasis to ex-post evaluation. The experience of
most credit line operations in the region is that second-tier banks tend to
duplicate the appraisal procedures of the first-tier banks, delaying by several
months their approval. Delays are even longer for subprojects above the free
limit that require Bank approval. This operation would try to reduce these
delays emphasizing ex-post review of subprojects by both the second-tier
bank and, to a limited extent, by the Bank. Another lesson concerning the
onlending mechanism is that under unstable macroeconomic conditions, and
periods of over and under valuation of the currency, it is difficult to pass on
the exchange risk to the ultimate borrower. When sudden devaluations have
made it difficult for subborrowers to repay their dollar denominated loans,
almost invariably the government has assumed the foreign exchange risk.
The Government will not assume the foreign exchange risk of this loan.
CFN will manage its foreign exchange risk. To this effect, unlike in the
past, CFN will now maintain US dollar accounts in the BCE earning interest
in US dollars. Since the ultimate subborrowers will be enterprises with
revenues in dollars or in sucres linked to international prices in US dollars,
CFN has requested a US dollar single currency loan, and is expected by the
Government to bear any residual foreign exchange risk.
4.10        Policy Conditionality and Legal Agreements. A lesson learned
from both financial sector and credit line operations is the need to establish
clear legal safeguards against the reversal of the policy measures that justified
the operations. Most credit line operations are justified on the basis of the
recent adoption of more liberal policies in trade or finance. However, when
during implementation some of these policies are reversed the Bank has no
legal recourse to suspend disbursements. Similar problems affect policy
loans. Since conditions for first tranche release are usually not specified in
the legal agreements, the Bank has no legal recourse when these policies are
reversed, even if this happens before the release of the second tranche. Even
if the policy conditionality for credit lines or policy loans is in the legal
agreements, the wording is frequently vague, which results in differences of
interpretation and difficulties for the Bank in enforcing the covenants. The
justification for this operation includes measures taken under this and other
Bank loans to liberalize the trade regime and the financial sector. To reduce
the risk of policy reversals, the legal agreements would have a review clause
indicating that after one third of the loan has been committed or after a year
of effectiveness --whichever comes first-- new commitments would pause for
a joint Bank/Government review of trade and financial policies.
Commitments would resume subject to a positive assessment by the Bank of
the government's adherence to the agreed policy reforms.



- 33 -
4.11       The proposed operation adopts other major lessons of prior
adjustment operations including: (a) a limited number of conditions focusing
comprehensively on feasible reforms to address the major issues; (b) well-
defined conditionality that is amenable to effective supervision; (c)
complementarity of the trade and financial policy programs with the IMF
program; and (d) significant up-front action ensuring the country's
commitment to the reforms.
V. THE BORROWER AND PRTICIPATING FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS
A. Corporaci6n Financiera Nacional (CFN)
5.1        CFN would be the borrower of the proposed loan; the proceeds
would be relent by CFN to participating financial institutions (PFIs) for
onlending to productive enterprises. The proposed operation is designed in
the context of a restructuring plan to convert CFN into a second-tier bank.
As a result of previous Bank operations using CFN as the apex institution,
CFN is ready to become a wholesale bank, onlending funds to retail financial
institutions rather than to end-users. The proposed project would reinforce
the expected evolution of CFN by strengthening its wholesale lending
function through provision of term funds for relending to PFIs and by
monitoring its progress in implementing its restructuring program.
5.2        CFN was established in 1964 as a government-owned banking
corporation with the following responsibilities: (i) to provide short and long-
term financing to developing industries; (ii) to assist the development and
expansion of industry through financial and technical assistance; (iii) to
stimulate capital markets through the sale of debt instruments, underwriting
security issues, and investments; (iv) to promote and channel external credit
to industrial development; and (v) to develop and direct funds to small and
micro-industries.
5.3        The "Law of Corporaci6n Financiera Nacional", issued in
December 1977, was the most recent modification of the governing legal
base of the institution. It was modified in August 1990 to: (i) allow CFN to
increase its authorized capital from s/. 2,000 million to s/. 100,000 million
(about US$90 million); (ii) to facilitate the issuance of its own securities; and
(iii) to institutionalize second-tier banking.
5.4        CFN's original operating capital was contributed by the BCE,
which continues to control 100% of its capital resources. The virtual



- 34 -
nonexistence of a capital market in Ecuador has limited the ability of CFN to
mobilize local resources and forced it to fund its lending program with BCE
rediscounts and through loans from international institutions, particularly
from the World Bank.
5.5        The main activities of CFN are three major financial programs
and a corporate investment portfolio.
(i)    General Operations Fund (FOGEN). A first-tier banking
operation that provides short term working capital loans and
medium/long term loans for equipment purchase. FOGEN is
the largest financing segment of CFN, with about 67% of its
total portfolio.
(ii)   Export Promotion Fund (FOPEX). A first-tier banling
operation that offers short-term pre-and post-shipment working
capital and medium/long term credit for expansion to non-
traditional exporters. FOPEX accounts for only 7% of CFN's
total portfolio.
(iii)  Small Scale Enterprise Fund (FOPINAR). A second-tier
banking operation that provides medium and long-term loans to
small enterprises and artisans. This fund accounts for about
26% of total portfolio; the Bank has made four loans for its
use.
(iv)  Investment Portfolio. CFN has also invested in corporations
and finance companies in industry and tourism. By end-1991
CFN had equity shares in 36 enterprises with an adjusted value
of US$52.8 million. The value of CFN's investment portfolio
is greater than that of its loan portfolio, net of provisions.
5.6        Between 1980 and 1985, a period of economic contraction for
Ecuador, loans disbursed by CFN decreased each year in real terms (from
US$135.5 million to US$79.8 million). Disbursements picked up in 1986
and 1987 in response to expansionary credit policies and negative real
interest rates charged for loans financed by the BCE. Loan disbursements
then declined again in 1988 and in 1989 (to about US$37.0 million) for lack
of BCE funding, curtailed as part of the government's credit restraint to
combat inflation. In 1990, loan disbursements recovered somewhat to
US$42.0 million, but decreased again in 1991 to US$39.2 million. The
reduction in loan disbursements reflects resources constraints due to delays in
negotiating loans from IDB and the Bank. The disbursements financed from

external credit lines increased from 27% in 1989 to 519% in 1990, but
decreased to 36% in 1991.
5.7        CFN is well organized and managed, although there is room
for some changes to improve the institution. It is vertically organized with
four functional units, each reporting to the General Manager. The Executive
Committee, composed of the Chairman, the Ministers of Industry and
Finance and the General Manager, is the highest level of operating authority
in CFN. The Board has nine members: the chairman, nominated by the
President of the Republic; six permanent positions held by high officials from
other government institutions; and two representatives from the private
sector, elected for two years. An internal group, the operations committee,
chaired by the General Manager is the de facto authority in many areas.
CFN is managed autonomously of the Government and is expected to service
Bank debt from its own resources. As a second-tier bank only, CFN is now
insulated from governmental intervention with respect to its lending
decisions.
CFN's New Role as Second-tier Bank.
5.8        Growing recognition that the BCE should not be involved in
direct financial intermediation has prompted the decision of the Government
and CFN's management to restructure CFN into a second-tier bank,
independent of BCE funding and able to mobilize international and local
capital market resources for onlending to private productive borrowers
through retail financial institutions. There has been also a recognition that
CFN should sell most of its equity investments and establish stringent limits
to this type of investments in the future. The transformation of CFN into a
second-tier bank has to be compatible with profitability and the full
assumption of credit risks of subloans by private PFIs.
5.9        CFN's transformation into a wholesale bank has been
accomplished through the suspension of all new retail lending activities. The
administration of the outstanding retail loans would be passed on to a
subsidiary of CFN or sold to private banks and finance companies. In the
context of loan preparation, CFN's board approved a Policy Statement
indicating that during the life of the proposed loan CFN would lend solely as
a second-tier bank. During negotiations the Bank agreed with CFN th t
resumption of first-tier lending would be cause for suspension of loan
disbursements.



- 36 -
5.10       As part of its reorientation towards wholesale lending, CFN has
started the process of selling its equity investments and liquidating troubled
subsidiaries. CFN had shares in 54 enterprises, but sold its shares in 17 of
them between 1989 and 1992. Of the remaining 37 enterprises, 23 were in
operation, 4 in promotion and 10 in liquidation at the end of 1992. The
estimated value of CFN's shares in the equity of the 23 operating enterprises
(which range from less than one percent to 99,7%) is s/. 67.9 billion, but the
value of these shares in the enterprise's equity was estimated at s/. 120.3
billion in December 1991 (US$93.5 million). The sale price of these shares
is estimated to be higher. CFN is now in the process of selling its
investments in the 23 operating enterprises through the stock exchanges of
Quito and Guayaquil. Sale of these investments would generate a cash flow
that would allow CFN to reduce its borrowing needs, while increasing
private sector participation in these enterprises. Before negotiations, CFN
presented to the Bank an Equity Valuation and Sales Plan specifying the
schedule and the rules and procedures for the sale of CFN's equity
investments. These rules have been approved by the Superintendency of
Companies. In September 1992, CFN's Board approved a document
establishing priorities for the sale of the remaining shares. During
negotiations, the Bank and CFN agreed that after a year of loan
effectiveness, the Bank would review CFN's progress in implementing the
Equity Sales Plan.
5.11        CFN will limit all future equity investments in accordance with
the objective of reducing the role of the public sector in the economy.
Before negotiations, CFN's board approved a Policy Statement limiting its
investment activities (equity participation in enterprises) to a maximum of
10% of CFN's equity and limiting its shares in any one enterprise to a
maximum of 51% of the firm's paid up capital.
5.12        Resource Mobilization. Although CFN is expected to play a
major role in domestic resource mobilization, lack of a developed capital
market will impede CFN's capacity to raise significant long-term sucre funds
in the near future. Therefore, increasing reliance on domestic resource
mobilization can only be gradual. Until the capital markets develop, CFN
will have to fund itself mostly through foreign resources, the sale of its
equity investments, and the placement of one-to two-year bonds in the local
market. In 1991 the SB approved new "Regulation for Issuing Titles and
Obligations by CFN", that gives more autonomy to CFN to issue obligations.
At the beginning of 1991, CFN obtained approval from the Monetary Board
to issue bonds for s./10 billion, of which s./2.5 billion was issued in June
1991. The interest rate of these bonds is linked to the average CD rate
(about 41.0% at the time of issuing), adjustable every six months. In August
1992 the Monetary Board approved another issue of bonds for s./25 billion.



- 37 -
According to CFN's financial projections, incremental outstanding bonds for
about US$2 million equivalent per year would provide a positive and realistic
target ibr CFN. During negotiations, the Baik and CFN agreed that after a
year of loan effectiveness the Bank would review CFN's progress in
implementing its Resource Mobilization Plan,
Institutional Develoment Plan.
5.13       The restructuring of CFN into a second-tier bank is being done
in two stages. As part of the first stage, CFN has adopted a new
organizational structure and has reduced significantly its staff through a staff
retirement program. In the second stage, CFN will formulate and adopt an
Institutional Development Plan to adjust further its funding, organization and
staffing to its wholesale banking role and strategy. Important components of
the Institutional Development Plan are a training program fur CFN's staff
and the improvement and redesign of CFN's management information
system. CFN's Institutional Development Plan will be developed with the
support of a concessionary Technical Assistance loan from IDB and its
implementation would take between two and four years.
5.14       Organizational Structure. In June 1992, CFN adopted a new
organizational structure more suitable to its new wholesale banking strategy.
The new organization reduced from seven to four the operating divisions.
The new divisions are: Operations, Business Development (Fomento),
Finance and Administration. The final organizational structure of CFN will
be designed with the help of specialized consultants as part of the TA
Program for CFN to be financed by IDB. The guiding principles for the new
organizational structure are a clear separation of funding and lending
operation, and upgrading the resource mobilization function. Within the
lending area, there is also a clear separation between second-tier operations
and the management of the outstanding portfolio of direct loans.
5.15       Staffing. CFN has reduced its staff from a total of 475 to 279
employees, a reduction of 41%, through a voluntary retirement program.
The staff left is, on the whole, competent and experienced; more than half
falls under the category of professional or technical personnel. CFN has
reassigned responsibilities and reclassified remaining staff according to the
requirements of the new organizational structure. Vacant positions will be
filled through selective hiring.
5.16        Training. Important training areas for a successful second-tier
bank are: (i) loan pricing and hedging against foreign exchange losses, (ii)
evaluation of financial intermediaries; and (ii) capital markets and resource



- 38 -
mobilization. On the evaluation of financial intermediaries, it has been
agreed that the SB would provide training to CFN staff on bank regulation
and supervision. IDB is expected to finance a training program for CFN
staff and for staff of the PFIs and subborrowers, as part of its Technical
Cooperation Program. To this effect, CFN has submitted for IDB's approval
a comprehensive training program for 1993.
5.17        Accounting and Management Information System. CFN has
implemented part of an Integrated System of Managerial Information,
developed since 1987 with the help of Price Waterhouse, under a TA
program supported by two Bank loans (Loans 2096-EC and 2221-EC). A
consultant's report, financed by IDB, indicates that the capacity of the system
has become saturated and does not provide satisfactory services. Moreover,
there is a need to reconceptualize the information model for CFN's
operations in light of its restructuring as a second-tier bank. The redesign of
the reporting function would involve rationalization of the system, acquisition
of hardware and software, and training. The development of an accounting
and management information system appropriate for CFN's new role as
second-tier bank, will be part of CFN's Institutional Development Plan.
5.18        Management of Second-tier Operations. To manage second-
tier operations, CFN has created a Financial Intermediaries Unit ascribed to
the Operations Division, and a Treasury Unit ascribed to the Finance
Division. These units coordinate the activities related to second-tier lending
that are carried out by different departments of CFN, such as selection and
follow up of PFIs, approval and supervision of subloans, and disbursements.
An Environmental Coordination Unit (para. 6.23) also has been created
ascribed to the Operations Division.
CFN's Financial Status
5.19        Valuation of CFN's Loan Portfolio CFN's loan portfolio at
December 31, 1991, amounted to s./81.6 billion (about US$64.8 million) of
which s./21.8 billion were loans to small and medium enterprises through
intermediary banks. CFN follows the loan classification system and
provisions policies established by the SB for all commercial banksY'. As of
December 31, 1990, CFN's loan portfolio arrears amounted to S/.5.4 billion,
of which 49.8% had arrears of over a year, 47.4% arrears between 90 days
and a year, and 2.4% had arrears of less than 90 days. Provisions,
S/ CFN's provisioning system classifies loans in four categories: (i) special attention: provision 1-5%; (ii) sub-
standard: provision 7-23%; (iii) in difficulty: provision 25-75%; and (iv) lost: provision 100%.



- 39 -
considered adequate, reached 8.8% of the loan portfolio. The quality of
CFN's portfolio of loans through first-tier banks is higher than that of its
direct lending operations. Arrears of the FOPINAR portfolio--also a second-
tier operation-- are practically nil. These are good indicators that the quality
of CFN's lending portfolio will improve after suspending its direct lending.
5.20       Valuation of CFN's Equity Investments. As indicated, CFN
has an important investment portfolio in 36 enterprises. In the balance sheet
of December 31, 1991, the value of these shares was s./67.9 billion (about
US$53.9 million), much higher than the book value of these shares a year
before (in the balance sheet of December 31, 1990 was s/.7.6 billion). The
book value of the shares as of 1990 did not reflect reality, since they had not
been revalued to reflect the full impact of inflation (authorized revaluations of
non-financial assets was less than half the inflation rate). Furthermore, in the
case of equity investments, book figures tended to reflect purchase values
instead of market or current values. This was a major accounting distortion
that complicated solvency analysis. For the 1991 statements CFN's assets,
including its equity investments were reexpressed, with the help of Price
Waterhouse, to reflect their inflation adjusted value (following International
Accounting Norm N. 29). The estimates were based on the lowest value of
three methods of adjustment applied to the largest investments, namely: (i)
acquisition value net of depreciation, adjusted by the general price index; (ii)
market value, if available, and (iii) the enterprise's adjusted equity. Most of
the investments with difficulties were given "zero" value. The SB had no
objections to the methodology applied for the revaluation of CFN's equity
portfolio. Subsequently to the revaluation exercise, CFN has sold its equity
in several enterprises at prices above the estimates made for the revaluation.
Among the most valuable CFN investments are nearly 50 per cent equity in
two cement factories and 8% shares in the Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento.
5.21       Valuation of CFN's equity was fundamental to decide whether
CFN had enough equity base to become the borrower under this operation.
As of December 31, 1991, CFN's capital base adjusted for restatement of
shares, land and building, amounted to s/.92.7 billion (about US$73.7
million) compared with total assets of S/. 184.2 billion. Risk assets
(deducting cash and fixed assets) amounted to S/. 159.3 billion.
Consequently, the capital to risk assets ratio reached 58%, well above the
10% ratio recommended for mature DFCs. CFN's equity for 1991 adjusted
for monetary correction reached SI. 214.7 billion, equivalent to US$170.7
million. With this level of equity, CFN is able justify borrowing a total of
US$200 million from the Bank, IDB and CAF. During negotiations it was
agreed that CFN would present evidence that its equity had increased during
the fiscal year 1991 to at least US$60.0 million, through revalorization or
sale of investments and/or additional capital contributions by the



- 40 -
Government. CFN has presented evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that its
equity has increased to the required amount through revalorization of assets.
Based on these results, in September 1992, the Superintendency of Banks
allowed CFN to increase the value of its paid capital to s/. 92.7 billion
(about US$46.3 million). During negotiations it was agreed that continued
disbursemenLs of the loan would be subject to the maintenance by CFN of a
Cvital adequacy ratio of at least 10%.

5.22         Profitability CFN's profitability improved in 1990 and 1991,
after registering losses in 1989. The reason for CFN's poor past
performance has been the negative lending interest rates that prevailed in the
past (the average lending rate was 30.5% in 1989, against an average
inflation rate of 78.1%). CFN's solvency as of December 31, 1992 was
adequate. The ratio of total debt to adjusted equity was about 1 to 0.8.

CFN's Financial Projections.
5.23         Financial projections for CFN have been made for the 1992-95
period. The projections are based on CFN's financial statements for the
years 1990 and 1991 (1992 are unaudited figures), reflecting CFN's equity
investments revalued as explained in pa>. 5.19. For the projection years,
revaluation of the non-monetary assets was assumed. The main assumptions
of the model are: disbursements in second-tier operations would be: US$44
million in 1993, US$78.7 million in 1994, and US$125.9 million in 1995;
and devaluation would be equal to the difference between domestic and
international inflation, assuming an inflation scenario for Ecuador of 30%
during the period. Table 5.2 presents CFN's financial projections for 1992-
1995 (see Tables 1 to 4 in Annex VI).

5.24        The model estimates CFN's net profits which would go entirely
to increase its equity. According to the projections, CFN's profits would be
positive in real terms after covering its financial and operational costs,
including the interest costs of the external loans and a fee for foreign
exchange risk to be set aside in a contingency fund, equal to the difference
between the domestic and the international inflation. The resulting spread for
CFN would be 2% per year. Similarly, CFN's solvency would be
maintained at satisfactory levels as indicated by the evolution of CFN's debt-
to-equity ratios, which would not increase beyond 2.1:1. Its liquidity would
also be appropriate.
B. Participating Financial Intermediaries
5.25        Commercial banks, DFCs and leasing companies would
intermediate the subloans under the proposed operation. To participate as
retailers, they would have to comply with the SB's capitalization and
provisioning standards, as well as with other agreed qualification criteria
(para 6.9). CFN, as the apex institution, would appraise prospective PFIs
and submit a report on each qualified PFI for Bank approval. Qualified PFIs
would sign a Participation Agreement in which they would commit
themselves to: (i) maintain an administrative unit staffed with at least two
qualified professionals to carry out subproject appraisal and supervision work
along the lines of the loan's operating guidelines; and (ii) present annual
audits by external auditors approved by CFN, on the basis of agreed uniform
financial reporting standards. Although a number of commercial banks and
DFCs have participated in previous Bank credit lines and are familiar with
appraisal procedures, it is likely that some prospective PFIs would only
qualify after further training on project evaluation.
Commercial Banks
5.26        Although most local commercial banks still show low levels of
profitability, due to past negative real interest rates, there has been
considerable progress in bank capitalization and provisioning since 1988,
when the SB adopted standards in accordance with international practice.
Table 5.3 presents the surpluses or deficits of capital of all the banks as of
December 1992. By that date, commercial banks, both local and foreign,
had surpassed the SB required capitalization levels by 31 %. The capital
surplus of the commercial banks amounted to US$71.5 million (deficiencies
amounted to US$8.3 million). Assuming a relationship of capital to risk
assets of 10%, these banks would be in the position to lend an additional
US$700 million. The equity position of several banks improved markedly



- 43 -
since December 1991, when new regulations entered into effect allowing for
the revaluation of non-financial assets. Previously, BCE norms for the
ievaluation of non-financial assets had kept revaluation well below inflation
(in the previous five years the obligatory revaluation index had been 53% of
the price index). As part of the qualification of PrIs, CFN would consider,
for capital adequacy purposes, the bank's revalued equity, as long as the
revaluation has been confirmed by the bank's external auditors and the SB.
Finance Companies
5.27       The original purpose of the DFCs was to provide medium and
long-term loans, primarily for industrial development. Until mid-1988, BCE
provided around 80% of the DFCs' funding. This situation has changed and
the DFC's liabilities are diversified among: CDs, bonds (development and
guarantee bonds), foreign borrowing, and borrowing from domestic banks.
DFCs have been the main retailers of loans from international institutions.
DFCs also showed low profitability levels for the last few years, and many
of them have curtailed their lending operations due to lack of medium-term
resources. Some DFCs have resorted to trade finance, short-term working
capital loans and leasing operations, where the returns are higher. Despite
these problems, DFCs have been more successful than commercial banks in
achieving the SB minimum provision and capital requirements. After the
liquidation in 1989 of four troubled DFCs, all the remaining DFCs were in
compliance with the SB by June 1991. By December 1992, they presented
total capital surplus with respect to the SB's requirement of US$7.6 million--
84% above SB requirements. This means that the finance companies would
have the capacity to lend an additional US$70 million. Table 5.3 shows the
surpluses and deficits of the DFCs with respect to the SB requirements. One
of the four largest DFCs has merged with a commercial bank to create the
first multiservice bank in Ecuador.

Leasing Companies
5.28        Leasing activities have experienced a rapid increase in Ecuador
in recent years because of favorable tax treatment for both the lessee and the
lessor, and the possibility of obtaining internal rates of return above the
interest rates charged by banks and finance companies. There are currently
nine leasing companies, but DFCs are also allowed to do leasing operations.
Most leasing companies are associated with commercial banks or financial
groups; only two medium-sized leasing companies are independent. The
main sources of funding for leasing companies are their parent banks and 90
day CDs. Although leasing companies are regulated by the SB, their
regulation is less stringent than for other financial institutions; they do not
have minimum capital requirements. Participation of leasing companies in
the proposed operation would be subject to: (i) a tax treatment that dees not
discriminate between leasing and credit transactions; and (ii) a more rigorous
regulatory framework for leasing companies, similar to the one applied to
banks and DFCs. Part of the Technical Assistance to be provided to the
Superintendency of Banks under this operation would be directed at
strengthening the supervision of leasing companies. This should take time
and little participation of leasing companies would be expected at the
beginning.

VI. THE PROPOSED-PROJECT
A. Proiject Obectivs
6.1        The objective of the proposed Project is to support private
sector development by:
First:   Improving the efficiency of the financial sector by:
- reducing state competition to private banks through the
restructuring of CFN into a second-tier bank and the
elimination of the financial intermediation role of the Central
Bank.
- supporting further interest rate liberalization and reduction
of banks' forced investments.
- introducing the use of interest capitalization schemes for term
lending to reduce the impact of high inflation.
- enabling the provision of a wider spectrum of financial
services through cominercial banks and finance companies.
Second:  Improving the efficiency of the productive sectors by:
- supporting further trade liberalization through the reduction
of tariff rates and quantitative restrictions, and simplifying
custom procedures.
- improving the climate and scope for private investment by
labor, mining and other legislation, sale of CFN's prior equity
investments, and appropriate regulatory changes.
Third:   Enablng the private sector to take advantage of an improved
economic environment through the timely provision of term
finance for investments.
B. Project Description
6.2         To achieve these objectives, the Project would include the
following components:
(a)   Global Line of Credit for Equipment and Incremental Working
Capital. The global line of credit of US$75 million would be

inflation component of interest rates for long-term loans (the program of
financial reforms is described in Chapter II). It was also agreed that
continuation of loan commitments after effectiveness would be contingent on
no retrogression of such reforms. The Government has already implemented
the agreed reforms. The New Monetary Regime Law (of May 7, 1992)
includes specific provisions allowing the Monetary Board to, inter alia: (i)
eliminate the provision of direct credit to financial institutions by the BCE,
except to cover such institutions' temporary liquidity problems; (ii) eliminate
forced investments of financial institutions (the obligation of commercial
banks to purchase bonds from BEV and the shares that commercial banks are
required to purchase from the BCE; and (iii) permit the capitalization during
the grace period of the inflation component of the interest rate in long-term
loans. A Monetary Board Regulation of September 3, 1992 eliminated the
formula linldng lending interest rates to the average cost of funds and a
Monetary Board Regulation of January 22, 1993, established a system of
market determined reference interest rates to facilitate long term financial
transactions. The financial policy measures are summarized in Annex I.
During negotiations it was agreed that continued commitments gf the loans
would be subject to: (i) maintenance of the policy to reduce in rea terms the
stock of Central Bank direct credit to financial institutions from 1993
onwards. expt to cover banks' tempoar liquidity problems: Cii' kein
banks' participation in financial funds to not more than 1 % of deposits: and
Ciii) maintenance of the policy of not allowing Banco del Estado to lend to
financial institutions, whether public or private, or to mobilize resources
fromthe private sector.
6.5        Trade Policy Reforms. During negotiations, the Bank agreed
with the Government that continuation of loan commitments after
effectiveness would be contingent on no retrogression of the trade reform
program adopted by the Government, described in Chapter III. This
program includes: (i) setting maximum tariff levels outside the Andean Pact
of 20% (except for motor vehicles and agricultural produce); (ii) removal of
remaining import and export QRs, except for a list of exceptions justified by
security, health and environmental concerns; and (iii) simplification of import
and export procedures. The trade policy measures are summarized in Annex
I.
6.6        The Government has presented a letter of intention outlining its
strategy for private sector development, including policies that affect the
investment climate and the financial and trade policy reforms implemented or
to be implemented in the context of this loan. During negotiations. the Bank
and the Government agreed on the inclusion in the legal agreement of a
review clause linking loan commitments to a positive assessment of the
Government policies affecting the private sector. The review clause would



- 48 -
indicate that after one third of the loan has been committed or after a year of
effectiveness--whichever comes first--new commitments would pause for a
review, by the Govemment and the Bank, of the economic environment for
private sector development. Commitments would resume subject to a
positive Bank assessment based on the following aspects:
(i)   the macroeconomic program, particularly the compatibility of
fiscal and monetary policy with progress towards
macroeconomic stability.
(ii)  the trade and financial policy regimes, particularly that there
has been no retrogression in the trade and financial policy
reforms that justify this project.
(iii)  the investment climate, particularly that no actions have been
taken by the Government that would adversely affect the private
sector.
C. Loan Amount
6.7        The proposed loan of US$75.0 million would be made to CFN
in US dollars, under the pilot program approved by the Executive Directors
on February 9, 1993. The Bank determined that CFN meets the eligibility
criteria for single currency loans: (i) CFN has a need for a US dollar single
currency loan to match the repayments it will receive from PFIs in US
dollars or sucres linked to US dollars (para. 2.22); (ii) CFN is managed
autonomously from the government and is expected by the government to
service Bank debt from its own revenues (para. 5.7); and (iii) CFN manages
the risks associated with the foreign currency composition of its assets and
liabilities (para. 4.9). The Bank has provided a borrower information
program to CFN, so that it would have sufficient information and assistance
to select loan terms on the basis of risk management considerations. The
interest rate of the Bank loan will be tied to the Bank's LIBOR based single
currency loan. The loan would have a term of 20 years including 5 years of
grace. The Government of Ecuador would guarantee the Bank loan to CFN.
It is expected that the Bank loan would be fully committed within four years
after effectiveness.

D. Project Implementation
Credit Component.
6.8         CFN as a wholesaler bank would channel funds to the PFIs
which, in turn, would finance their client's long-term plant, equipment and
working capital needs, and/or write equipment lease contracts. The PFIs,
which would bear the subloan credit risk, would be responsible for subproject
appraisal and supervision. To be able to operate as a second-tier bank
during the transition period of its restructuring into a second-tier institution,
CFN has adopted a new organizational structure and created a Financial
Intermediaries Unit and a Treasury Unit (para. 5.18). Since the training of
CFN's staff under IDB's TA program will take some time, and CFN needs
some critical expertise to operate the line, during negotiations it was ageed
that loan effectiveness would be conditioned on the hiring of two qualified
consultants, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank: one to assist in
the selection of PFIs and the other to assist in pricing the loan to PFIs.
6.9         PFI's Accreditation. It would be critical for CFN to select
PFIs following strict solvency criteria and that those selected remain sound
and in good financial standing. For an intermediary to be eligible, its
solvency would have to be satisfactory to the SB and CFN, based on criteria
acceptable to the Bank. Eligibility criteria would include:
(i)   net equity levels equal to or greater than those required by the
SB to be estimated using established valuation procedures;
(ii)   provisioning levels equal to or greater than those required by
the SB (to cover probable losses as a function of portfolio
quality, based on the SB classification of portfolio quality);
(iii) earnings performance. Net income adjusted for inflation and
provisions should provide a positive return on equity during the
previous three years;
(iv)   adequacy of staff and procedures to implement efficiently the
following activities: (a) loan promotion, (b) project and subloan
appraisals, (c) supervision of projects and subloans, as well as
verification of procurement aspects and environmental
guidelines under the subloans. Alternatively, the PFI would
have to use consultants of recognized quality, satisfactory to
CFN; and



- 50 -
(v)   have its financial statements audited by external auditors
approved by the SB.
6.10       For leasing companies to be eligible to participate as PFIs, they
have to be subject to the same equity and provisioning levels as banks and
finance companies. Failure to continue to comply with these criteria would
disqualify PFIs from further participation in the project. The accreditation of
PFIs would be regularly reviewed during Bank supervision. During
negotiations, CFN presented a draft eligibility criteria to select PFIs and a
draft Participation Agreement between CFN and a PFI. During negotiations
it was agreed that CFN's Board would adopt satisfactory PFI eligibility
criteria and that signature of at least three Participation Agreements,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness.
6.11       Neither the Bank nor CFN would duplicate the credit or project
analysis of the PFIs. CFN would perform ex-post quality control to
determine whether the eligibility criteria for subprojects and subborrowers
have been met. A main aspect of the procedures to be applied is that CFN
would approve subloans presented by the PFIs with minimum ex-a  review
of the subproject documentation so as to expedite the process; but, CFN
would emphasize ex-post review of docum-ents and the supervision of both
the PFIs and the subborrower. For each PFI, the ex-ante review of
subprojects would be implemented for above free-limit subloans. A free-
limit subloan would be a PFI's first or subsecuent subloans after the first
three subloans of this PFI have been reviewed by CFN and approved by the
Bank. If a subsequent ex-post review of free-limit subloans by CFN or the
Bank reveals noncompliance of a PFI with the agreed requisites, the PFI
again could be subject to ex-ante reviews or, in case of more serious
deficiencies, it could lose its accreditation under the loan. The same
arrangements would operate for leases.
6.12       CFN would adopt three basic documents to operate under the
proposed program: a new Operating Policy Strategy, a Credit Regulation
Manual and an Environmental Evaluation Manual.
6.13       The new Operating Policy Strategy (OPS) will describe the
policies and procedures that apply to CFN' wholesale banking role under the
project and its policies with respect to equity investments. During
negotiations it was agreed that CFN's Board would adopt an Operating Policy
Strategy, satisfactory to the Bank. It was also agreed that continuous
disbursement of the loan would be subject to CFN's adherence to the agreed
OPS.



- 51 -
6.14       The Credit Regulation Manual will describe the norms and
procedures guiding CFN's lending operations under the proposed program.
The regulations will cover, inter-alia:
-eligibility criteria of subborrowers
-eligibility criteria and procedures to select PFIs
-use of Bank resources
-terms and conditions of subloans
-maximum loan amounts
-free limits
-minimum loan participation by PFIs
-minimum equity contribution by subborrowers
-disbursement procedures
-subproject documentation requirements.
CFN has presented to the Bank a draft Credit Regulation Manual. Dgrin
negotiations, it was agreed that before effectiveness CFN would finalize, in a
mtanner satisfactory to the Bank. and formally adopt, a Credit Regulation
Manual. It was also agreed with CFN that the content of this manual would
be revised only after consultation with the Bank.
Technical Assistance Component.
6.15       TA For CFN's Institutional Development Plan. IDB's Board
has approved a US$2.27 million TA operation to support CFN's
restructuring. The TA operation will finance the preparation of CFN's
Institutional Development Plan and the training program for CFN's staff. As
part of the agreed collaboration between the Bank and IDB, in the context of
this operation, the content of the TA program has been discussed with the
Bank.
6.16       TA For PFI's Training. Under previous Bank operations, CFN
has organized training courses for PFIs on project evaluation with emphasis
on market analysis, and the financial and economic analysis of projects.
CFN would continue organizing such courses with funding from IDB's TA
loan, adding training in assessing the project's compliance with
environmental norms. IDB's TA loan would also finance training to
subborrowers. Following CFN's voluntary retirement program, a number of
former CFN staff, with expertise in project evaluation, have been employed
by prospective PFIs. This transfer will help increase the project evaluation
capability of these institutions.

E. Relending Mechanism, Terms and Conditions
6.17       Relending Mechanism. The Bank loan to CFN would be in US
dollars under the Single Currency Option adopted by the Bank on February
9, 1993. Under contractual arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, CFN
would pass on the proceeds of the Bank loan in US dollars or in sucres
indexed to the US dollar to the PFIs, which would onlend the funds in the
same currency to eligible subborrowers. Loan repayments by PFIs will be
made in dollars or in sucres at the free exchange rate prevalent the day the
repayment is due. Dollar loans will be granted provided that the Government
maintains a free exchange rate regime. CFN would establish a separate
project account to accumulate subloan repayments until they become due for
repayment under the Bank loan. Repayments in sucres will be converted to
US dollars at the prevailing market exchange rate on the day of the
repayment before depositing to this account. The funds thus accumulated
would be used for further onlending for similar purposes and on similar
conditions. The reason for lending the Bank funds in dollars is to match
CFN's dollar assets with its dollar liabilities. The opening of the economy
should enable producers of tradeables to assume the dollar exchange risk.
6.18       Foreign Exchange Risk. The dollar exchange risk of the Bank
loan will be assumed by the ultimate borrowers. CFN's dollars from loan
recoveries will be deposited in the BCE, at least initially. To protect CFN
against foreign exchange losses, the BCE would pay CFN an interest rate on
such dollars based on the average earnings of its monetary reserves. During
the review pause, one year after effectiveness, the Government would decide
whether to allow CFN to maintain foreign currency accounts. During
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on payment of
interests by the BCE on CFN's dollar accounts.
6.19       Interest Rates on CFN Loans to PFIs. CFN would relend the
Project funds to the PFIs in dollars at market interest rates. The interest
rates on CFN loans to the PFIs would be established, initially, through direct
negotiations between CFN and the PFI, based on a floor rate. Later on,
CFN will consider the adoption of an auction mechanism. The rates on
dollar loans to the PFIs would be linked to the Bank's LIBOR based variable
rate plus a margin to cover operating costs, credit risks and a reasonable
profit for CFN. The margin would remain constant during the lifetime of
the intermediary loan and the rates would be adjusted every six months, on
January I and July 1 of each year. CFN would try to obtain the highest
margin over the Bank rate that PFIs would be willing to pay.
6.20       CFN will lend in sucres funds mobilized from the local market
through bond issues, the sale of its shares in local enterprises and the



- 53 -
recovery of current sucre loans. Sucre loans will be at market interest rates
and would be offered with the option of capitalization of interest during the
loan's grace period. During the review pause, the authorities and the Bank
would decide on the convenience of extending the capitalization of interest
option to the amortization period. In case of sucre loans, CFN's floor
interest rates should cover: financial costs, credit risks, operating costs, and a
reasonable profit for CFN. CFN would try to obtain the highest rate PFIs
would be willing to pay. Once the rate for an intermediary in a specific
operation were established, the margin--expressed in percentage points--
between the resulting CFN rate and the Reference Lending Rate would
remain constant during the life of the intermediary loan. The Reference
Lending Rate is calculated by the BCE and published in the leading
newspapers. Since CFN's lending rates would be adjusted every three or six
months, the new adjusted interest rate would be equal to the new outstanding
Reference Lending Rate plus the constant difference.
6.21       CFN is reluctant to implement an auction mechanism to price
and allocate the funds to the PFIs from the beginning, because of uncertainty
about the number of PFIs that would be able to participate initially in the
operation and the absence of alternative sources of long term finance in
Ecuador. During negotiations CFN agreed to present. within a year of loan
effectiveness, an pction plan for establishing and makdng use of an auction
mechanism to price and allocate the loan proceeds to the PFIs. CFN wyould
then agree with the Bank on the implementation of the auction mechanism.
6.22       Interest Rates on PFIs Subloans to Subborrowers. Bank funds
would be lent in dollars or in sucres indexed to dollars. It is expected that
the majority of the subborrowers will be enterprises producing tradeable
goods or services whose international prices are quoted in US dollars.
Interest rates to final borrowers would be freely agreed between the PFIs and
their clients. The variations of interest rates in dollar subloans would be
linked, as in the case of intermediary loans, to the variations of the Bank
LIBOR based interest rate. The variations of interest rates on sucre subloans
would be linked to the variations of the Reference Lending Rate. An interest
capitalization scheme to capitalize the inflation part of the interest rate would
be offered as an option to the final borrowers, to avoid the adverse effect on
cash flow management of high nominal interest rates. Every six months
CFN will send a report to the Bank on the interest rates charged to PFIs and
subborrowers. During negotiations it was agreed that continued disbursement
of the loan would be contingent to the maintenance of market determined
interest rates.
6.23       Eligible Subprojects. Subborrowers would be enterprises that
have revenues in US dollars or in sucres linked to international prices. The



- 54 -
proJect would finance technically, financially, and economically sound
investment subprojects of viable enterprises in all sectors. Bank funds would
be available for equipment purchase and for associated working capital. The
minimum subloan size would be US$85,000 and the accumulated maximum
subloans to any individual company by a PFI would be US$5.0 million
equivalent. For each subproject the PFI would be required to finance at least
6% of the financing package from its own funds; this may include the
working capital loans they normally extend. These matching funds could
have shorter repayment schedules with a minimum of six months, compatible
with the short-term nature of the PFIs' resources. The minimum equity
contribution by the subborrower would be 15% of total project cost excluding
recurrent labor costs, working capital, imputed value of investments already
made and contributions in kind. Subprojects would have to yield a financial
rate of return of no less than 12% in real terms.
6.24       Maturities and Grace Periods. The maturity for equipment
subloans would vary from 3 to 12 years with a maximum grace period of 3
years. Permanent working capital subloans would be for a maximum of two
years with a six month grace period. Lease financing--provided that the
leasing company complies with the capital and provision requirements of
financial companies-- would have maturities of 3 to 12 years and no grace
period.
6.25       Eligible Expenditures. In addition to financing investments in
plant and equipment and permanent working capital, the Bank may consider
financing the following expenditures important for adapting local production
to greater competition:
(a)   Worker's Retraining. A shift in market focus or changes in
the organization of production may affect the size and
composition of the firm's work force. Retraining expenditures
may be eligible expenditures and could be included in a
subloan.
(b)   Technical Services. Consultant services to improve the firm's
productivity or to prevent or reduce environmental damage
associated with an investment, would be eligible.
6.26       Environmental Requirements. The current environmental
institutional and legal framework is very weak in Ecuador. For this reason,
the Bank is preparing a Technical Assistance Project for Natural Resources
Management and Environmerital Protection. CFN has created an
Environmental Coordination Unit (ECU) ascribed to the Operations Area.
The ECU has developed the procedural requirements for the environmental



- 55 -
evaluation of subprojects and is preparing an Environmental Manual
describing the environnmental selection criteria to be met by subprojects
financed under the credlit line. Approval of subprojects with potentially
damaging environmental impact would require preparation of an
environmental impact assessment to be cleared by the ECU. A clear division
of responsibilities and acLcountability has been established between CFN, the
PFIs and other environimental agencies. CFN will prepare a training
program, supported by IDB's technical assistance loan, for ECU's staff and
the staff of the PFIs thaet would carry out or review the environmental
assessment prepared by consultants. During negotiations it was a rd tha
preparation of an Environmental Manual acceptable to the Bank, would be a
condition of loan effectiveness. It was also agreed that the content of this
document would be revised only after consultation with the Bank.
6.27       CFN would ensure that the PFIs review each subproject
according to the environmental manual and selection criteria. Also, it would
make sure, through the ECU, that subborrowers carry out any corrective
measures to prevent environmental damage required as conditions for
granting the subloans. ]For subprojects that cause negative environmental
effects, not foreseen, the ECU would also recommend corrective measures
that could be financed by complementary subloans.
6.28       Free Limit and Subproject Documentation Requirements. The
first three subloans approved by CFN for each PFI will have to be reviewed
and authorized by the Bank. The Bank would make periodic sample analysis
of individual subproject appraisals during supervision missions. All
subprojects would be apjpraised by the PFIs in accordance with CFN's
appraisal requirements established under prior Bank loans. CFN would agree
with each PFI on a free limit of no more than US$1.0 million. If the
subloan is above the free, limit, CFN would review the basis used by the PFI
in approving the subproj,ect before granting approval. For subloans above
US$2.0 million, the subproject documentation would include a feasibility
study of the investment project and an analysis of the operational and
financial situation of the company. CFN will keep copies of the subloan
application (submitted by the subborrower to the PFI), the PFI's credit
evaluation and the subloan agreement between the subborrower and the PFI
for Bank inspection during supervision. No loan proceeds shall be
transferred to the subborrower or the PFI except for reimbursement of actual
payments made.
6.29       To give fluency to the disbursement mechanism for subloans
below each PFI free limit, CFN would use an immediate disbursement
system whereby: (i) the PFI would present a summary subloan application to
CFN together with a swom statement indicating that the operation complies



- 56 -
with all requirements under the credit line; (ii) CFN would immediately
reimburse the funds to the PFI or disburse to suppliers or contractors at the
request of the PFI. After disbursements have been made, CFN would review
the documentation presented by the PFI. If the ex-post analysis demonstrates
non-compliance by the PFI with the loan requirement, penalties would be
applied ranging between: loss of the immediate reimbursement option for
subsequent subloans, loss of accreditation under the line, or acceleration of
repayment of CFN's loan to the PFI.
F. Procurement
6.30       Procurement of goods, works and services would be done itt
accordance with Bank guidelines. The Government of Ecuador has recently
enacted new procurement legislation that resolves past disagreements
regarding the precedence of Bank procurement guidelines over local
legislation. The Loan Agreement for this project will contain explicit
provisions dealing with points of difference, either in substance or
interpretation, between Bank guidelines and Ecuadorean legislation. The
table below shows an estimate of the expenditures by procurement method,
based on a sample of the pipeline of projects of prospective PFIs.
6.31       For subprojects financed under the credit line program and
executed by subborrowers, procurement of goods, works and services would
comply with those customary for operations through financial intermediaries.
Experience with similar operations in Ecuador has been that private sector
procurement practices are adequate, particularly among medium and large
enterprises. PFIs would ensure that contracts valued at US$3.0 million
equivalent or above would be procured through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures, in accordance with Bank guidelines; a preference
margin may be granted to local producers for ICB contracts for goods.
Contracts costing less than US$3.0 million equivalent would be procured
following normal commercial practices for the private sector. In order to
assure efficiency in contracting, beneficiaries would be required to award
contracts on the basis of quotations from at least two eligible suppliers,
except in those cases where direct contracting is permissible as per para. 3.5
of Bank procurement guidelines. All subproject appraisals would include a
discussion of procurement procedures used and criteria for selection of
suppliers of goods and services, and indicate that these conform with the
procurement provisions specified in the Loan Agreement. These
procurement principles would be incorporated in CFN's Credit Regulation
Manual. Evidence of the quotations requested would be required for ex-post
review during project supervision. The Bank's Procurement guidelines for
the Use of Consultants of August 1981, as well as particular provisions



- 57 -
spelled out in all loan agreements for Ecuador, would be applicable to
contracting of consultants financed by subloans. Prior review by the Bank
of procurement documentation would be carried out for: (i) all contracts
procured through ICB; and (ii) the first contract procured by other methods
submitted by each PFI. Procurement procedures and documents under other
contracts would be subject to random review by the Bank during project
supervision.

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the amounts to be financed by the Bank
loan.
N.B.F.: Not Bank Financed (IDB, CAF, PFIs, Subborrowers).
G. Disbursements
6.32       To facilitate project execution, a Special Account would be
established in BCE in US dollars to finance the Bank's share of subloans.
The Bank would make an initial deposit into it of US$5.0 million. CFN
would submit to the Bank a monthly statement of the transactions of the
Special Account.
6.33       Under the credit component, the Bank would finance 94% of
the amounts disbursed by PFIs for subloans. In all cases, Bank
reimbursements would be related to expenditures made not more than 180
days prior to submission of the application by the PFI to CFN.
6.34       Expenditures for individual contracts valued at under
US$200,000 for goods and US$500,000 equivalent for works financed by
subloans would be disbursed against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
certified by CFN. CFN would ensure that all supporting documentation is
being adequately maintained and that it would be available for review at the
Bank's request. Disbursements for all contracts valued at or above
US$200,000 for goods and US$500,000 equivalent for works, and under the
TA component, would be made against fully documented withdrawal
applications.



- 58 -
6.35       These disbursement arrangements would be incorporated in
CFN's Credit Regulation Manual. During-negotiations, agreement-was
reached with  FN on the disbursementrrangements. The loar. is expected
to take four years to commit and six years to disburse, somewhat longer than
the standard profile of DFC operations in Ecuador, due to the complex nature
of this operation that involves the restructuring of CFN. The final date for
submission of subloans would be June 1, 1997, the Completion date would
be December 1, 1998, and the Closing Date for the loan would be June 1,
1999.
H. Monitoring,. Reporting and Auditing
6.36       The Bank's monitoring of the project would be at three levels:
(i) implementation of the Project, (ii) the institutional development of CFN,
and (iii) the maintenance of the trade and financial policy reforms that
justified the operation. The monitoring of project implementation by the
Bank would focus on: (i) the accreditation and follow up of PFIs by CFN,
(ii) CFN's adherence to the OPG, (iii) the PFIs repayment of loans to CFN,
and (iv) the implementation of the TA components. Bank supervision
missions would assess all these aspects and carry out §pns. reviews of
samples of subprojects presented by the PFIs. In addition, CFN would
prepare and submit to the Bank semiannual progress reports on project
implementation, including a review of interest rates charged to PFIs and
subborrowers. The Bank's supervision of CFN's institutional development
would involve assessing CFN's performance in accordance to the agreed IDP
for its transformation into a second-tier bark. CFN will also present
semiannual reports on progress in implementing its IDP. The Bank's
monitoring of the policy environment would focus on the maintenance by the
government of the financial and trade policy reforms agreed with the Bank
under this operation. In addition to monitoring the compliance with the
policy reforms during supervision, the Bank will carry out a major policy
review after one third of the project funds have been committed or after a
year of effectiveness --whichever comes first. A Project Completion Report
will be produced no later than six months after closing the loan. CFN will
be responsible for preparing Part II of the Project Completion Report.
During negotiations, agreements ws reached with CFN on these
arrangements for monitoring and supervision.
6.37       The accounts of CFN, including those kept for the purpose of
the project, the Special Account, and Statement of Expenditures, would be
audited annually by independent private auditors acceptable to the Bank. The
audit reports, including an opinion regarding the supporting documentation
for disbursements based on SOEs, would be submitted within six months



- 59 -
after the end of CFN's fiscal year. The accounts of the PFIs would also
have to be audited annually by external auditors acceptable to CFN and
submitted to CFN within sx months after the end of the fiscal year. These
audits would be available to Bank supervision missions. During negotiations.
agreements was reached with CFN on these reporting and auditing
arrangemeni
I. Benefitsand-Risks
6.38       The major benefits of the proposed project would be related to
the increase in efficiency of the productive and financial sectors. The
provision of term financing at the time Ecuador is adopting a more liberal
trade regime would enable the private sector to undertake the necessary
investments for export production, enterprise restructuring and modernization
that should accompany a trade liberalization program. The project would,
therefore, help increase the international competitiveness of Ecuadorean firms
and ensure that the reform agenda is maintained. By supporting CFN
restructuring into a second-tier bank, the project would reduce the
dependence of CFN on BCE's funding and demonstrate the viability of a
second-tier role for a public bank. Finally, the financial and investment
policy changes supported by the proposed Project would help improve the
availability and effectiveness of long-term funds for productive investments.
6.39       CFN will lend in US dollars or sucres indexed to the dollar to
PPIs which, in turn, will lend in the same currency to enterprises with
revenues in dollars or in sucres linked to international US dollar prices.
Therefore, PFIs will not bear any currency risk and business enterprises will
bear minimal currency risk. Borrowing on a US dollar single currency loan
basis will enable CFN to match the currency of its debt obligation with the
effective currency of its repayments from PFIs. Single currency loan terms
will eliminate the risks of exchange rate movements in Japanese yen and
Deutsche mark group relative to US dollars that CFN would have born with
the Bank's currency pool loan.
6.40       The trade liberalization program supported by this operation has
three major benefits. First, it will establish the appropriate policy framework
to foster growth and development through increased exports, export
diversification and efficient import substitution. Increased competition
resulting from trade liberalization will encourage businesses to allocate
resources to activities where they can best compete. Second, the program
will lead to an increased demand for labor, which will help reduce



- 60 -
poverty§'. Third, the Government will also derive important benefits from
the program, including improved collection of tariffs and a less costly
management of trade policy instruments.
6.41        The major risk to this project would be the Government's
failure to advance or continue its stabilization program and thereby to reduce
inflation or reverse its present more liberal trade, investment and other
policies. Inflation has dropped steadily in the first months of 1993, but it is
still above 45% per annum. High inflation has kept interest rates at high
nominal levels, which result in a heavy financial burden for borrowers in the
initial years of a loan. High nominal rates could, therefore, constrain the
investment recovery that should accompany the trade liberalization program.
To lessen this risk, the project would offer subloans indexed to the US
dollar. Sucre subloans made by CFN with its own resources will have the
option of capitalization of interests during the grace period to reduce the
financial burden in the initial years of the loan caused by high inflation.
Another risk would be that the Government could give in to internal
pressures to reinstate the provision of Central Bank subsidized credit to the
productive sectors. To reduce this risk, the project agreement would have a
review clause establishing that after one third of the loan has been committed
or after a year of effectiveness--whichever comes first--new commitments
would pause for a Bank review of trade and financial policies. Commitments
would resume subject to a positive assessment of the government's adherence
to the agreed policy reforms.
6.42        While the onlending arrangement of this loan protects CFN
from interest rate risk, PFIs could face increased credit risk if sharp
increases in LIBOR caused subborrowers to be unable to meet their debt
obligations. However, CFN has determined that these risks are more
manageable than the currency risks it would have faced with a currency pool
loan.
6.43        There is also the risk of a reversal of trade, financial or private
investment policies encouraged by an oil-led appreciation of the currency or a
new episode of macroeconomic instability. High inflation could lead the
Government to reestablish controls on imports in an effort to stem the drain
on international reserves in lieu of raising the real official exchange rate.
High inflation could also lead the Government to reestablish controls on
prices and exports. A reversal of trade liberalIzation policies could also take
place under a stable macroeconomic environment. Producers could succd

in convincing a new economic team that protection should be reestablished to
encourage domestic production and industrial employment. This could
particularly occur if an oil boom led to appreciation of the domestic currency
and thereby reduced the international competitiveness of other tradeable
products. The likelihood of these events is being constrained by the inclusion
in the legal documents of the review clause referred to above. Moreover,
some policy reversals are restricted by on-going trade and investment
liberalization policies in several other countries of the region.
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements
7.1        During Negotiations agreement was confirmed upon:
(a) with Government:
(i)   that continued commitments of the loan would be subject to
(para. 6.4):
-maintenance of the policy to reduce in real terms the stock
of Central Bank direct credit to financial institutions, from
1993 onwards, except to cover bank's temporary liquidity
problems.
-keeping banks' participation in financial funds to not more than
1% of deposits.
-maintenance of the policy of not allowing Banco del Estado to
provide subsidized credit tc private financial institutions.
(ii)  that the Loan Agreement would have the following Dated
Covenanta:
-after a year of effectiveness, or after one third of the loan has
been committed--whichever is first--new commitments would
pause for a review of the economic environment for private
sector development. Commitments would resume subject to a
positive assessment by the Bank based on the following aspects
(para. 6.6):

- the macroeconomic program, particularly the compatibility of
fiscal and monetary policy with progress towards
macroeconomic stability.
- the trade and financial policy regimes, particularly that there
has been no retrogression in the trade and financial policy
reforms agreed under this project; and
- the investment climate, particularly that no actions have been
taken by the Govemment that would adversely affect the private
sector.
(iii) that CFN would borrow the Bank funds in US dollars under the
Single Currency Option and lend these funds in US dollars or
in sucres indexed to the dollar to Participating Financial
Institutions. PFI repayments would be made in dollars or in
sucres at the free market exchange rate of the day in which
payment is made (para. 6.17).

-maintenance of a free exchange rate policy (para. 6.17).
-maintenance of a regime of free market determined interest
rates (para. 6.22).
(v)   that the Central Bank of Ecuador would pay CFN an interest
rate on CFN's dollar deposits based on the average earnings of
its liquid reserves, to protect CFN against exchange losses in
this operation (para. 6.18).
(b) with CrN:
(i)   that it would present to the Bank satisfactory evidence that its
equity has increased, during the fiscal year 1991, to at least
US$60.0 million through revaluation of assets or new capital
contributions (para. 5.21).
(ii)  that it would finalize in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, and
obtain approval by its Board, of the Operating Policy Strategy
(para. 6.13) agreed during negotiations.



- 63 -
(iii)  that it would take the following measures before loan
Effectiveness.
-hire two qualified consultants: one to support the Financial
Intermediary Unit in the selection of PFIs, and another to
support the Treasury Unit in pricing the loan resources (para.
6.8).
-sign satisfactory Participation Agreements with at least three
eligible PFIs (para. 6.10).
-finalize in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and formally
adopt the Credit Regulation Manual (para. 6.14).
-prepare and formally adopt an Environmental Manual and
Selection Criteria satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.26).
(iv)  that the Loan Agreement would have the following Dated
Covenants:
-after a year of loan effectiveness, CFN will present a report on
the implementation of its Equity Valuation and Sales Plan
(para. 5.10) and its Local Resource Mobilization Plan (para.
5.12).
-within a year of loan effectiveness, CFN will have begun
implementation of the Institutional Development Plan, designed
with IDB support (para. 5.13).
-within a year of loan effectiveness, CFN will present an action
plan, for establishing and making use of an auction mechanism
to price and allocate the loan proceeds to the PFIs, and agree
with the Bank on its implementation (para. 6.21).
-every six months, CFN will present a progress report on the
functioning of the credit line and implementation of CFN's
Institutional Development Plan (para. 6.36).
(v)   that continued disbursements of the loan would be subject to:
-CFN's adherence to the decision to operate as a second-tier
bank exclusively and keep equity investments within the limits
agreed with the Bank (para. 5.9).



- 64 -
-CFN's maintenance of a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10%
(5.21).
-CFN's adherence to the agreed Operating Policy Strategy
(para. 6.13).
-interest rates charged on any loans made by CFN (including
intermediary loans) and subloans made by financial
intermediaries be freely market determined (para. 6.22).
B. Recommendation
7.2        With the foregoing agreements and understandings, the
proposed Project would be suitable for a US$75 million US dollar single
currency loan to CFN. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5
years of grace on repayment of principal, and carry the standard variable
Bank LIBOR based interest rate. The loan would be guaranteed by the
Repi!blic of Ecuador.

ECUADOR
PRIATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJEC
1.    The sectoral structure of Ecuador's economy has been shaped by
many years of macroeconomic and sectoral policies that discriminated against
agriculture and mining while subsidizing industry. Other sectors such as
transportation and communications were also heavily subsidized. The move
towards a more neutral policy environment since the mid-1980's has already
induced important changes in sectoral growth rates and their shares of GDP.
2.    Manufacturing Sector. The deliberate industrial promotion policy of
the 1970's, supported by a strong extemnal sector, resulted in rates of growth
of manufacturing output higher than GDP growth rates. Most manufacturing
growth was geared towards the domestic market, with exports playing only a
marginal role. Manufacturing growth was largely generated by capital
accumulation, with employment and productivity growth playing a secondary
role. These features have greatly increased the sector's vulnerability to
external shocks. In the eighties, when external credit became scarce and
earnings from oil exports dropped, manufacturing growth became negative.
Nevertheless, many firms in the sector can achieve international
competitiveness. The comparative advantage for many manufacturing firms--
chiefly determined by international prices of Ecuador's natural resource based
exports--has improved since the 1970's. Increase competitiveness can be
achieved through consistent macroeconomic policies, a neutral trade policy,
and the elimination of factor market distortions. The growth of non-
traditional manufacturing exports is essential to achieve adequate economic
performance in the medium term. This will require the maintenance of a
competitive exchange. The Government has taken important steps in the
desired direction. Future policy reform will also have to focus on labor
regulations, which currently discriminate against employment.
3.    Agricultural Sector. The import substitution policies implemented
during the oil boom years discriminated against agricultural production,
which grew barely faster than the population. In contrast, during the 1982-
1989 period the sector responded to improved incentives--including the more
attractive exchange rate, import liberalization measures adopted in the mid-
eighties, and the improvement in agricultural credit facilities and marketing--
by growing at a rate of 6.2 percent per year, almost three times the growth
of GDP. During this period, exports of processed agricultural and fish
products (cacao, coffee, fish and shrimp) more than doubled their share of
agricultuiral exports. Despite these gains, agricultural potential is still
restricted by price and export controls on key commodities. The igricultural
sector stands to gain greatly from a more liberal trade regime. It is the most
promising sector in the economy in the near future, with substantial room for

expansion in the areas of non-traditional products and processed foods. The
fihing sector is expected to recover from the setback in 1989, but efficiency
gains in shrimp and fish farming will be required if the sector is to remain
competitive. There is also a considerable export potential in the areas of fish
meal and processed fish.
4.    Petroleum Sector. Current estimates of petroleum reserves indicate a
production peak of about 111 million barrels per year (300,000 b/d) in the
middle of the decade, and a decline in production in the second half of the
nineties. These projections actually assume a significant level of investment
in the sector facilitated by a removal of impediments to foreign investment,
particularly in the area of exploration. It is unlikely that petroleum will
continue to play a leading economic role, therefore, Ecuador must adopt
policies that will ensure economic diversification.
5.    Natural Resources. The recent approval of the Mining Law should
expedite the development of the mining sector by helping to eliminate
previous constraints particularly in the area of foreign investment. New
opportunities are likely to open for the exploration of gold, silver and
calcium carbonate reserves. For environmental and commercial reasons the
authorities intend to implement programs to reverse recent trends in
deforestation and to begin expanding the output of forestry products.
Provisions in the new tax law recently enacted by the legislature contain
incentives to develop the forestry sector.

Dear Mr. Preston:
The Republic of Ecuador is seeking a loan from the international
Bank for Reconstruction and Development to support the
restructuring and expansion of private sector enterprises as
Ecuador enters a new phase of its development process. We
request your consideration of this loan, which was initially
prepared under the previous administration, since it will
contribute significantly to the ability of the Government to
implement its economic program. The measures taken so far by our
administration to stabilize the economy and our proposed program
of fundamental structural reforms are geared toward promoting
private sector development in our economy and encouraging private
investment. The support being sought by the Bank will be
instrumental to ensure a smooth flow of f inancing for the needs
of the private sector.  In this letter, we would like to outline
the Government's program and the actions taken so far.
initial Measmres.  The Government of the Republic of Ecuador that
assumed office on August 11, 1992, found the economy beset by
large and growing macroeconomic imbalances. The fiscal deficit
(including Central Bank operational losses) was projected to
reach 7 percent of GDP for 1992.  Inflation qxceeded 50 percent
per year, and net international reserves had fallen from US$760
million (4 months of merchandise imports) at end-l99l to US$260
million (about 1 month of merchandise imports). Much of the
remaining reserves were nfeded for immediate payments, including
US$88 million in arrears to multilateral organizations,
governments, and suppliers.
Immediately after assuming office, the Government took dramatic
measures to correct macroeconomic disequilibria.  Key public
sector prices were adjusted substantially, not only to reduce the
YO--ublic sector deficit. but also to improve efficiency in resource

allocation and to eliminate hidden and distortive subsidies.
Domestic prices of petroleum derivatives were raised by 115
percent on average. In particular, gasoline prices were
increased by 124 percent, bringing them to international levels.
Electricity tariffs were raised by an average of 120 percent to a
level broadly in line with long-run marginal costs. Other public
utility tariffs (telephone, water and sewer, etc.) are also being
adjusted to reflect true costs.
Other important measures in the fiscal field included a once-and-
for-all tax (0.3 to 7 per thousand) on the value of real assets
of enterprises; a substantial cut in public sector expenditures;
a freeze in public sector hiring; and the elimination, merging,
or transferring to the private sector of a number of public
sector entities.
The Government also took steps to replenish its foreign exchange
reserves by sharply devaluing and fixing, temporarily, the
commercial exchange rate (above the free market rate). The
decision to fix the rate was partly influenced by the desire to
use it as means to condition inflationary expectations and to
provide a nominal anchor that would enhance the credibility of
the program. The sucre was devalied in the official
("intervention") market by about 33 percent to 2,000 sucres per
dollar, a measure that also helped to restore export
competitiveness. The new rate was applicable to exports only,
since importers were granted the freedom to purchase foreign
currency in the free market.
The Government's monetary program has been designed to achieve
the Government's anti-inflation and balance of payments
objectives. TAe primary contributor to the success of the
monetary program will be improved public sector finances. The
General Government will not just refrain from borrowing from the
Central Bank but is expected to accumulate substantial deposits
and ease the pressures on monetary policy. The Central Bank also
has introduced several new instruments to improve its management
of monetary policy, such as open market operations, regular
auctions of open market securities and the operation of a modern
money desk for daily transactions. These instruments will allow
the Government to fulfil its commitment to reduce in real terms
the stock of direct credit to financial institutions, except to
cover the temporary liquidity problems of commercial banks.
Structural Reforms. The Government recognizes that the
macroeconomic stabilization program has to be accompanied and
supported by deep structural reforms in order to secure an
enduring restoration of confidence and thus a recovery of private
investment and sustained groWth.  In particular, the Government
is convinced that first order of priority lies with a profound
rm oS e b SUablc sector, which is necessary to reverse the
oor economic performance and continuous decline in living

standards of the last decade. To provide the basis for better
budgetary management and reform of the public sector, the
Government obtained congressional approval, in November 1992, for
a new Budget Law. This law brings under executive control public
spending that was before largely outside the budget.
Furthermore, to provide the institutional framework for the
operation of a modern and efficient state, the Government has
formed a high level commission to manage the reform of the state
and has submitted for congressional approval a "Modernization of
the State Law" covering restructuring, decentralization and
privatization of public enterprises. This law will grant
authority to the Executive Branch to proceed with the sale of
public enterprises and introduce a program of voluntary
retirement for public employees.
jrjV a Sector feIo=sj. The Government firmly believes that the
private sector in Ecuador should play a leading role in economic
development and has taken measures to improve the climate for the
private sector participation in the areas of investment, finance
and trade.
A new investmeng code was adopted in mid-1991 that provided equal
treatment for national and foreign corporations in terms of
fiscal incentives, eliminated limits to repatriation of profits
and allowed foreign investment in several previously restricted
sectors. Recent regulations eliminated remaining restrictions on
foreign investment in commercial banking and prior authorization
for the transfer of equity shares. Foreign firms and investors
can now become local investors without registering or meeting
specific qualifications. Additionally, private and foreign
investment in the petroleum sector will be encouraged by means of
amendments to the Hydrocarbons Law designed to optimize the
management of this exhaustible resource.
To facilitate investments, the process of registering a
corporation is being much streamlined. The objective is to
reduce this process to no more than 8 working days. A new
Companies Law will soon be submitted for congressional approval.
This law will further reduce the formation or the liquidation of
companies to one step, except for the ones which emit obligations
which will be regulated by the Capital Markets Law, also being
sent to Congress.
The Government has also taken important steps to deepen financial
refDj= and to reduce the role of the public sector in financial
intermediation. Consistent with the market-based approach to
monetary policy, tte Government fully liberalized interest rates
in November, eliminating the formula linking maximum lending
rates to the cost of funds for loans made by financial
institutions with their own resources, and sharply reduced
re,serve requirements.

The new Monetary Regime Law, approved in May 1992, reformed the
Central Bank, eliminating its financial intermediation role and
restricting Central Bank loans to the financial sector to short-
term liquidity needs. The law, as approved, would have made a
newly created State Bank the depository institution for public
sector accounts. It is our intention to amend provisions of this
law to retain the public sector deposits in the Central Bank, and
to ensure that the Development Bank of Ecuador does not become
the State Bank and does not expand its role into provision of
(subsidized) credits to the financial sector. The new Monetary
Regime law also eliminated the obligation of commercial banks to
keep a share of their capital and reserves in shares of the
Central Bank, which we intend to maintain.  Similarly, the
Government is committed not to increase the current requirements
that commercial banks place one percent of their deposits in
special financial funds.
The financial role of other public banks is also being curtailed.
Banco Nacional de Fomento will not receive more Government funds
and will be allowed to operate only with its own recovered funds.
The Ecuadorean Housing Bank (BEV) has instituted a program for
cost and personnel reduction, and is being converted into a
second tier institution. The Ecuadoran Development Bank will
continue to exercise its current functions of intermediating
funds to Municipalities and Provinces under current agreements
with Multilateral Organizations that require it to charge market
interest rates.
The Corporaci6n Financiera Nacional (CFN), the prospective
borrower of the Bank loan, already has been converted into a
second-tier bank for lending exclusively through private
commercial financial institutions. CFN would lend in dollars
resources provided by Multilateral Financial Institutions, and in
sucres funds mobilized from the local market through bonds, the
sale of its equity in several enterprises and the recovery of
current sucre loans. The counterpart fund contributed by the
financial intermediaries could also be in sucres. Sucre loans
will be offered with the option of capitalization of interest
during the grace period.
To further advance the development of the financial sector, the
Government has prepared and will soon submit for congressional
approval a new Capital Markets Law and a Financial Institutions
Law. We are also studying suitable reforms to the social
security system, including the creation of pension funds as a way
to deepen the capital markets.
This Government is committed to trade reform as the means to
increase the efficiency and competitiveness of domestic
production, and has taken measures to advance further the trade
liberalization program initiated under the previous
inistration.  Soon after taking office, Ecuador dropped

previous objections to joining the Andean Pact Free Trade Area.
Imports from Colombia and Bolivia enter duty free since September
1992 and from Venezuela enter duty free since February 1993.   In
November 1992, Ecuador further reduced tariff rates by adopting a
5 to.20 percent tariff schedule for imports outside the Andean
Pact countries (except for motor vehicles that, temporarily, will
continue to face tariffs of 40 percent).   The Government has
also advanced the program of simplification of import and export
procedures. The Export Facilitation and Cargo Reserve Law
approved by Congress in March 1992, simplified export procedures
and ended the monopoly of state-owned and associated foreign
ships in the transport of merchandise. The new Government has
taken measures to facilitate imports, eliminating the requirement
of obtaining authorization from the Central Bank to retire
imported merchandise from customs. The Government has also
submitted for congressional approval a Custom Law that would help
improve the efficiency and transparency of custom operations.
Initial Results. A number of clearly positive results are
already being observed since the launching of the Government's
macroeconomic program. Given that short-term devaluation
expectations have been practically eliminated, there has been a
substantial reflow of private capital, as the private sector has
shifted from dollar-denominated to sucre-denominated financial
assets on a scale that has vastly exceeded our most optimistic
expectations. Partly as a result, the Central Bank has rapidly
accumulated foreign exchange reserves, surpassing the
international reserve objective set for end-1992 under the
original monetary program. With these positive results, the
Government decided to float the exchange rate, within a wide
intervention band, in November 1992. Since then, the exchange
has gained some strength and its volatility has been reduced.
Monetary policy has been successful, in great part because net
domestic credit of the Central Bank has been kept well within the
program's targets. In particular, net credit to the public
sector has been contracting in line with the program. These
developments clearly suggest that we are firmly on the path
towarda achieving our fiscal deficit reduction objectives.
After an initial increase, reflecting the pass-through to the
price level of the realignment of the exchange rate, gasoline
prices and public utility tariffs, the monthly inflation rate
drop in November and December of 1992 average less than 1.5
percent a month. The successful implementation of the monetary
and financial program to date, and in particular the observed
improvement in the fiscal position, make us confident that the
monthly rate of inflation will decline significantly over the
next few months. The results of policies Furthermore, the
significant shift in private sector preferences in favor of
sucre-denominated financial assets encourages us to believe that
he process of disinflation will not have to entail a socially

costly recession. To the extent that the private sector prefers
to hold a higher proportion of their financial savings in
Ecuador, rather than abroad, there will be ample room for a non
inflationary expansion of credit to finance private investment,
and this should offset the potentially recessionary effect of the
fiscal adjustment.
Future Refoma. Our efforts are focused on continuing to
strengthen the credibility of the economic program. We are
conscious that it is of crucial importance to move along with the
intended structural reforms, particularly as regards to reducing
the size of the public sector, reorienting its expenditures, and
improving the efficiency in the provision of public goods and
services. Besides the new Budget Law and the "Modernization of
the State" law, we are working also on draft versions of other
key legislation aimed at deepening structural reforms, including
in the areas of tax administration, petroleum sector reform and
the creation of a macrotconomic stabilization fund.
To ensure appropriate financing for our macroeconomic adjustment
and structural reform program over the next years, we have begun
in earnest discussions with multilateral financial institutions,
including the IMF, the World Bank, and the Inter-American
Development Bank. We expect to sign a Letter of Intent with the
IxY, and we would then expect its Board to approve a Stand-by
program for 1993-1994. In the context of a program endorsed and
supported by these institutions, we shall further our
negotiations with the Paris Club and commercial bank creditors to
seek a comprehensive, negotiated and realistic solution to the
foreign commercial bank debt problem, in the context of the Brady
Plan. As regards to the debt to foreign governments, Ecuador
will seek debt restructuring and reduction within the terms
available under the Paris Club and the Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative.
To conclude, we are convinced that the economic program we are
implementing aims in the right direction and is essential to turn
the Ecuadorean economy into a more efficient and prosperous one,
better integrated into the international system of trade and
finance, and thus benefiting from the processes of technological
change that ar          sustained improvements in productivity
and, thus,    the livi g standards of the Ecuadoran people.
