MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OP THE PRESIDENT
OF TBE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPtEKT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UTED REPBLIC OP TANZANIA
FOR A HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to TFnzania for SDR 36.1 million (US$ 47.6 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The Credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity.  The project would be co-financed by the
Government of Belgium for USS 0.7 million equivalent, the Danish
International Development Agency for US$ 1.3 million equivalent, the Swiss
Development Cooperation for US$ 12.2 million equivalent, the British
Overseas Development Administration for US$ 0.1 million, and the UNFPA for
US$ 0.7 million.
2.       Background.  The capacity of the Government to deliver effective
social services has seriously deteriorated during the 1980s largely due to
the severe economic difficulties and mismanagement which Tanzania has
experienced, as reflected in a decline in per capita GDP of about 2.3
percent per annum during the period 1980-85. In order to reverse this
situation, the Government has committed itself to introducing and
maintaining appropriate macro and sectoral policies.
3.         At the macro-level, the Gemernment initiated a major program of
economic reform in 1986 through the Economic Recovery Program (ERP).
Encouraging progress has been made, checking the decline in economic growth
and re-establishing the base for sustainable development. During 1989, the
Goverament has prepared a follow-up macroecono,mic reform program, the
Economic and Social Action Program (ESAP), which amongst its key objectives
seeks to fully incorporate the social sectors in the process of economic
adjustment, so as to reverse their decline through the implementation of a
program of structural reforms. The Priority Social Action Program (PSAP)
elaborates the Government's ESAP social sectors priorities, and provides a
policy framework for the population, health and nutrition (PHN) sectors.
4.          In population, the first National Population Policy is about to
be approved by Government. This policy has a very ambitious target of
reducing fertility by 30 percent by the year 2000, thereby contributing to
a reduction in the population growth rate (currently about 2.9 percent per
annum). UNFPA and the Bank have provided assistance to the Government in
this exercise, but the real initiative has been from the Government, with
the Party playing an important catalytic role. In March 1989, a donors
conference was held, which was successful in mobilizing support for an
expanded program of family planning. Major support for IEC and staff
training will be coming from NORAD, SIDA, USAID and UNFPA; whilst an
expanded supply of contraceptives will be coming from USAID and UNFPA.
5.       In health, a new national health policy has been prepared, which
seeks to update the primary health care (PHC) strategy in the light of the



-2
changed economic circumstances and to secure the financial sustainability
of the sector. In this regard, the Government is evaluating alternative
options for the long-term financing for the sector which do not restrict
the access of poor households to adequate services. Tanzania is benefiting
from significant support from the donor community in the health sector in
meeting its-objectives of "Health for All by 20000, with both DANIDA and
UNICEF featuring prominently, and growing support from such donors as the
British ODA, Italian Government, NORAD, SIDA, SDC and WHO; the national
AIDS program in particular has been well-funded. However, both the
problems and the needs of the sector are still Imuense.
6.       In nutrition, the Government is determined to reduce the high
incidence of malnutrition; some 40 percent of children under 5 suffer from
moderate and 6 percent suffer from severe malnutrition. In addition,
micro-nutrient deficiencies are significant public health problems 41
peruent of the population experience some degree of iodine deficiency;
iron-deficiency anemia is hyper-endemic amongst pregnant w) :.n: and vitamin
A deficiency is a severe problem for children. The Tanzani Food and
Nutrition Centre (TFNC), which has benefited from the support of donors
such as SIDA and UNICEF, has developed national micro-nutrient deficiency
control programs. The iodine deficiency cont_ol program is already
receiving support from the Netherlands and SIDA. Efforts to improve child
nutrition more generally have made encouraging progress in are;r such as
the Iringa region, through a community-based approach. supported by UNICEF,
the Italian Government, WHO and other donors. The Government is seeking
resources to replicate these approaches nationally.
7.       Given Government's clear comaitment to appropriate policies, the
major challenge it faces now is to deal effectively wit. several specific
problems impeding implementation. First, the planning, information sYstem
and policy formulation capacity of the MOR is weak and needs to be
strengthened to complete the design of and carry out a program of rational
reforms. Second, serious deficiencies exist in two critical PHU sub-
systems, namely manpower and pharmaceutical and medical supplies. A more
appropriate mix of trained manpower has to be established and a greater
emphasis must be given to improving the quality of existing manpower
through effective in-service training. Equally, radical reform is required
in the critical areas of financing, pricing, procurement and distribution
of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to ensure the sustainability of
these vital inputs. The Government has begun to address these issues
through a DANIDA-financed master plan for the Central Medical Stores (CMS)
and in the context of the draft National Drug Policy, prepared vith
assistance from WHO. Third, the quality and effectiveness of PHI services
need to be improved, through a renewed emphasis on an appropriate and cost-
effective primary health care (PHC) strategy, which emphasizes community
participation. PHC services in urban areas in particular, which have
suffered from two decades of relative neglect, need to be improved.
8.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project will reinforce the
Government's efforts (including the ESAP and PSAP) to raise the quality,
coverage and effectiveness of family planning, nutrition and basic health
services in urban and rural areas, through providing support to critical
and strategic elements of the PHN sectors, with particular emphasis on
strengthening: (i) institutional capacity for planning and policy



-3-
formulation and implementation; (ii) manpower development and training;
(iii) sustainable provision and financing of pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies; (iv) micro-nutrient deficiency programs; r) implementation of the
national population policy; vi) rural PHC, through the implementation of
the revised strategy in selected districts; and vii) urban PHC, through
reform and rehabilitation.
9.       Proiecc Description.  To meet these objectives, the project will
support improvements int i) health planning, policy formulation and
information syste , through upgrading of staff skills, studies on health
financing and the domestic pharmaceuticals 'ndustry, and strengthening the
project coordination capacity of the MON; (ii) manpower development and
training, through support to in-service training at the district level and
the implementation of a realistic manpower plan; (iii) pharmaceutical and
medical supplies, through reforms to the pricing, financing, management and
procurement of pharmaceutical and medical supplies and the rehabilitation
of the central warehouse facility; (iv) the implementation of national
micro-nutrient deficiency control programs for vitamin A and iron,
including training, supplies and operations research; (v) the
implementation of the national population policy, through building up the
analytical, monitoring and implementation capacity of the Population Unit
of the Planning Commission and establishing a 'National Population
Information Centre'; (vi) rural PHC, through the implementation of the
revised PHC strategy (incorporated in district health plans (DHP)) in 10
selected districts, including mobilization of communities, support to
v¶741age PEC and nutrition initiatives, district nam*gement strengthening,
rehabilitation and maintenance of health facilities; and (vii) urban PHC,
through improved management, maintenance, supply systems and the
rehabilitation of health facilities, in Dar es Salaam. Related policy
reforms will be supported in three major areas, namely: (i) the composition
and incentives for health sector manpower; (ii) the pricing, financing,
budgeting, and procurement for the pharmaceuticals sub-sector; and (iii)
the development of resource mobilization measures for the sector.
10.        The project will be implemented over a five year period by the
MOH, MLG, TFNC, Planning Commission and the Dar es Salaam City Council,
responsible for their specific components. Key project staff have already
been appointed by the MOH and MLG and budgetary provision made for project
commencement in FY90. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. The allocation, amounts, methods of procurement and
disbursement of the IDA Credit are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
project preparation and the status of Bank Group operations in Tanzania are
shown in Schedules C and D respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8217-TA, dated February 5, 1990, are also attached.
11.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Government is embarking upon
key reforms in the PHN sectors and requires external assistance in strategy
development and financial support for their implementation. Through its
experience in supporting sectoral reform in the context of macroeconomic
adjustment in other countries and based upon the analysis of the Bank PHN
Sector Review (Report No. 7495-TA), IDA has a comparative advantage in
assisting the Government ln tackling the strategic issues in the PHN
sectors and in establishing a sound framework for future developments,
thereby catalyzing future Government and donor initiatives. Other donors



-4-
have concentrated on strengthening particular PHU programs, rather than
addressing systemic and policy issues, and welcome an IDA role in this
regard as a complement to their own continuing support. The project
buttresses the Government's com Aitment to macroeconomic reform as embodied
in the ESAP. As the first IDA-supported operation in the PHN sectors, this
project both responds to Tanzania's priority needs and enhances the
existing dialogue with Government in the PHN sectors.
12.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached that
Government would undertake the followings by December 1990, submit a
revised PHC strategy satisfactory to IDA; by July 1991, reach agreement
with IDA on the share of the recurrent budget going to the health sector
and an improved incentives package for health sector manpower; by December
1991, submit the draft health sector manpower plan for IDA review; by April
1992, reach agreement with IDA on the plan of action for the long-term
financing of the health sector; and by July 1992, conmence implementation
of the agreed manpower plan.  Coammencement of the implementation of (i) the
reforms in the pricing, budgeting, financing and procurement in the
pharmaceuticals sub-sector, and (ii) the plan of action for the long-term
financing of the health sector, would be conditions of disbursement for the
second and third portions respectively of the funds for pharmaceuticals
procurement. Adoption of a revised institutional structure for the CMS,
which is satisfactory to IDA, and agreement on the plan of action for
rehabilitating the CMS, will be conditions of dirbursement for the
rehabilitation ef the CMS warehouse complex. Adoption of a plan of action,
satisfactory to IDA, for strengthening the Department of Manpower
Development & Training is a. condition of disbursement for overseas training
for staff from that Department. IDA approval of the DHD for each district
annually would be a condition of disbursement for continued support to the
district concerned.
13.      Project Benefits. The project will assist the Government to
undertake much needed reforms in the PHN sectors, such as improving long-
term sustainability and efficiency, and will provide an opportunity to
improve services in neglected areas. It will also assist the Government in
the impleLr-tation of the national population policy, which will help to
reduce the pace of population growth, and in the implementation of a
revised PHC Strategy, thereby contributing towards improved nutritional
status for women and children in particular. The project represents a
major response to the ESAP and will contribute significantly to the
development of Tanzania's human resource base during the process of
economic adjustment.  The project has a strong institution-building focus
in terms of planning, policy formulation and implementation in the MON, the
MLG and the Dar es Salaam City Council.
14.      Project Risks.  Project risks are three-fold.  Administrative
capacity in the implementing agencies is weak. In order to minimize this
risk, the implementation capacity of these agencies is being strengthened
under the project. The second risk is that of weak performance by staff
(resulting from poor motivation due to low salaries) undermining effective
implementation of project activities. The Government is most cocerned
about this issue, and with IDA assistance, is already reviewing the
remuneration policy for staff, as one key element of civil service refom
to be supported in a Public Sector Management operation. The project will



also contribute to reducing this risk through support to Government efforts
to develop an improved incentives package for health sector staff, and the
provision of non-salary inducements to staff (such as training,
recognition, and improved supervision). The third risk is that the
macroeconomic environment may deteriorate again if the Government fails to
proceed with the reform program. The Bank and the international donor
coamunity are addressing this risk through country dialogue, policy-based
operations, the Consultative Group and PFP process. Fundamentally the
Government believes that the reform process, fully incorporating the social
sectors, is its best strategy for economic advancement.
15.       scomudatio.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
