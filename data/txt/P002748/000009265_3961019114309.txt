UNITED REPUBUC OF TANZANIA
SIXTH HIGHWAY REHABIUTA TION PROJECT
(Credit 1688-TA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Sixth Highway
Rehabilitation Project in Tanzania, for which Credit 1688- TA in the amount of SDR 43.3
million (US$ 50 million equivalent) was approved on June 25, 1986 and made effective on
December 4, 1986.
The credit was closed on June 30, 1994, compared with the original June 30, 1992
closing date. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on October 31,
1994. Parallel financing for the project was provided by grants from the governments of
Denmark (IJS$ 2 million) and Norway (US$ 17.1 million), and a loan from the African
Development Fund (US$ 17.45 million). The total financing of the project, including the
Government contribution (US$ 22 million) was US$ 117.15 million.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Yitzhak Kamhi, Task Manager, and Mrs. Aoufa
Ezzine, Consultant, Energy and Infrastructure Division of the Africa region, and reviewed
by Mr. Stephen Weissman, Division Chiet and Mr. S.K. Agarwal, Project Advisor,
AF2DR..
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in November 1994. It is based on materials in the project file. The borrower
contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing own evaluation of the project's
execution (Appendix II).

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Tanzania is a large country (945,000 km2) with a widely dispersed population of
28 million, most of whom live in rural areas. Agriculture is the key sector, accounting for
over 60 percent of GNP, 90 percent of employment and about 85 percent of foreign
exchange eamings. Transport plays a vital role in this sector for intemal distribution and
marketing of inputs and food crops, including export of cash crops. The transport
infrastructure also serves as an important corridor for the extemal trade of Tanzania's
land-locked neighbors- Zambia, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and increasingly,
Malawi. Roads are predominant means of transport in all sectors, with railways carrying a
major share of the important import/export traffic.
2.    The transport system is comprise of five sectors: (i) a road network of about
82,000 kms; (ii) two railway systems totaling about 3,610 kms of track (2,640 kms
operated by the Tanzanian Railway Corporation (TRC) and 970 kms within Tanzania by
the jointly owned Tanzania/Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA)); (iii) ocean ports
managed and operated by the Tanzanian Harbours Authority (THA); (iv) two
international airports and over 60 smaller airfields (mostly unpaved); and (v) a pipeline
conveys crude oil products from Dar-es-Salaam to the Zambian border.
3.    The basic road network links all the main production centers but with varying
degrees of efficiency. At the time of project appraisal, only about 3,000 kms (30 percent)
of the trunk roads were paved and most had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance. The
two rail systems were also in varying degrees of disrepair due to poor maintenance of
tracks, locomotives and wagons. The transport sector in general suffered from a shortage
of trained and experienced personnel, weak management, and an acute scarcity of foreign
exchange to meet the costs of spare parts and imported materials.
4.    The Bank Group has extended credits and loans to help finance five highway
projects, one trucking project, two railway projects, and five port projects. Prior to this
credit, and during the earlier years of lending, the projects concentrated on financing of
construction and equipment. The focus later shifted to the strengthening of local
institutions with provisions for technical assistance and training. While experience with
the execution of physical components has generally been satisfactory, the technical
assistance and the training objectives have been difficult to achieve mainly because of
(i) delays in the appointment of technical assistance staff, (ii) cultural and language
adjustment problems of technical assistance staff, (iii) lack of effective administrative
commitment by Government, (iv) lack of suitable local counterparts, and (v) unrealistic
targets. Experience also showed that technical assistance staff should be more carefully
chosen to ensure their suitability.



iii
5.    An important lesson learned from the fourth and fifth highway projects was the
high cost of undertaking civil works by force accounts. Efforts should be made to develop
the local contracting industry so that much of the road maintenance and rehabilitation
works could be let out to contractors. The Sixth Highway project included a component
to promote the execution of road maintenance works by contract.
6.    This project was prepared and appraised in 1985 under a very different economic
environment than when implemented in 1986. The macroeconomic reform started in 1986
when the Government launched the Economic Recovery Program (ERP). The measures
initiated at that time included significant exchange and interest rate adjustments, increases
in producer prices for export crops, and reduction of the number of price-controlled items.
These actions were followed up with trade liberalization measures including export
retention accounts and the Open General License facility (OGL), gradual dismantling of
administrative controls over prices and distribution, and progressive devaluation of the
currency. The economic response to these reforms was positive, with Gross Domestic
Product growing at between 4 and 5 percent per annum. Agricultural production also
increased substantially. The volume of road traffic, transport of crops out of the rural
areas and transport of consumer goods into the rural areas increased despite the
deterioration of the road infrastructure. Roads were deteriorating faster than they were
rehabilitated.
Project Objectives
7.    The objectives of the project, were to: (i) reduce the transport costs by
rehabilitating the most important sections of the highway network; (ii) improve the system
of road maintenance works by increasing contractors rather than by force account;
(iii) assist and expand the capacity and efficiency of the trucking industry; and (iv) increase
the availability of trained engineers in Tanzania.
8.    The project provided for: (i) a road rehabilitation program consisting of 295 kms
of the TANZAM Highway and 700 kms to 1,000 kms of gravel roads; (ii) an equipment
rehabilitation program for the inoperable equipment and vehicles bought under the Fourth
and Fifth Highway projects; (iii) technical assistance to the Ministry of Communications
and Works (MCW) in project coordination, road maintenance, and equipment
management; (iv) general training to MCW staff, (v) assistance to the local contracting
industry;, (vi) assistance to the trucking industry; and (vii) consulting services to carry out
an agricultural feeder road study, various feasibility studies and detailed engineering for
several roads.
9.    The project had to be restructured as a result of the increased scope of work, e.g.
widening of unpaved roads and asphalt chip sealing of pave road shoulders. The number
of kilometers of gravel roads had to be reduced from 1,000 kms to 130 kms. Since
preparation of the Integrated Roads Project (IRP) was well underway, the work not
contracted under this project was rolled over to IRP. NORAD increased its contribution
from USS 6.9 million to US$ 17.1 million to finance an additional section of Tanzam



iv
Highway, increasing the total length of the road sections to be rehabilitated from 295 kms
to 370 kms.
Imnplementation Experience and Results
10.   While the project as restructured met substantially its objectives for the road
rehabilitation components, it partially achieved its objectives for the technical assistance
and training components, and it failed its objectives for equipment rehabilitation
component.
11.   The vehicle operating costs were reduced in average by at least 30 percent for all
the rehabilitated roads. The Economic Rate of Return now is 41 percent for Tanzam
Highway, compared to 39 percent at appraisal, and 37 percent for the gravel roads,
compared to 27 percent at appraisal. The data provided by MWCT indicated an increase
of traffic in the Tanzam Highway (almost three times more than the appraisal estimates),
which is due to higher economic activity as a result of the improvement of the roads.
12.   The project as a whole was completed two years behind schedule, in 1994, with
considerable delays and variations for the various project components.
13.   Procurement delays were the main cause of slow start-up of the project. This
prompted the inclusion, under IRP, of a comprehensive study to overhaul the
Government's procurement and supply management system, preceded by agreement
between GOT and IDA of interim procurement regulations, standard procurement
documents and more realistic procurement decision-making limits at ministry and regional
levels.
14.   The roads works proved to be a major source of delays, due to inadequate and
poorly documented engineering designs. As a result, significant changes occurred in the
field and the actual costs of roads works had been increased well above appraisal
estimates. As result of this cost overrun, the project scope had to be amended and the
road rehabilitation was concentrated on Tanzam Highway, by expanding it to 370 kms.
The scope of the gravel road rehabilitation was reduced from about 1000 kms to 130 kms
and the remaining work was rolled over to IRP.
15.   The equipment rehabilitation component started 2 years behind schedule. The
delay was caused by weak management within the MWCT, lack of proper planning of
plant maintenance and utilization of spare parts, and delays in procurement decisions.
These problems remain to date.
16.   The training and technical assistance components had a slow start up due to delays
in the completion of the training facilities.
17.   The initial project cost at appraisal was estimated at US$107.7 million. The final
project cost rose to US$ 117.15 million primarily due to (i) due to the inclusion of the



v
equipment rehabilitation component (US$2.9 million), (ii) the increased component for
the feasibility studies (US$ 7.4 million), and (iii) the exchange rate fluctuation (US$8.6
million). Funding of the total project costs was provided by IDA (US$ 58.6 million),
grants from NORAD (US$17.1 million) and the government of Denmark (US$2 million),
loan from the African Development Fund (US$17.45 million) and a government
contribution of US$22 million.
18.   The project outcome was satisfactory since the project substantially met its
objectives for the paved road rehabilitation component. With this project providing
invaluable experience to MWCT, the ministry is better prepared to manage and contract
IRP's massive investments. Additionally, with regards to institutional development, the
project increased the availability of trained engineers in Tanzania. Further, the assistance
to the Local Contracting Industry enabled the Borrower to improve the local construction
industry. Local contractors acquired training in project management, budgeting, and
preparation of bidding documents. Some of these contractors are now undertaking civil
works under IRP. The assistance to the trucking industry constituted technical assistance
especially accountants and mechanics, and the provision of spare parts, tires and
workshops tools for the Regional Trucking Companies (RETCOs).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
19.   As noted, this project helped in the preparation of the IRP, in the sense that the
lessons learned during implementation of the Sixth Highway project were taken into
account in the preparation of IRP. The two ongoing IRP projects, which provided for
rehabilitation works and institutional support to MWCT, will provide support to the
Government by giving priority to road maintenance, improving transport sector
administration through policy and institutional reforms, expanding the domestic roads
construction industry; improving management and procurement practices, and mobilizing
and coordinating the substantial resources required to support these actions.
Key Lessons Learned
20.   Lessons from the project are:
e   Undertake main institutional changes prior to project effectiveness. The structure of
road administration has been subject to frequent changes during the implementation
of the project. The result of these changes was confusion, poorly organized
planning administration and ineffective long-term institutional and work force
development. Therefore, main institutional and policy changes, including
reorganization and institutional reinforcement of roads administration, as well as
changes in the procurement regulations should be undertaken prior to project
effectiveness.



vi
*   Phase policy changes with implementation progress. Physical progress is often
needed to highlight the needed changes. It would be appropriate to annually review
the program and to phase it with implementation progress, using subsequent fund
releases based on continuing institutional reforms and strengthening.
*   Re-evaluate the engineering design of the roads works before commencement of
project. Inadequate engineering design of roads works and weak documentation
caused substantial changes in the field, delays in the implementation, and cost
overruns. A careful reevaluation of the engineering design prior to actual
commencement of works would avoid such delays and cost overruns.
*    Condition the approval of roads works contracts financed by IDA on the
Government agreed annual road budget. Road networks are deteriorating faster
than the level of investments to rehabilitate and to maintain them. Therefore, the
Government should invest more in timely periodic road maintenance works, while
IDA's contribution should be for road rehabilitation and upgrading projects.
-   Establish a maintenance strategy for the roads. No project can be sustained without
policy and institutional reforms for proper maintenance strategy for the roads
network.
-   Improve the regulatory environment to stimulate the development of the private
sector. An important objective of the project was to carry out major maintenance
and rehabilitation works by contract rather than by force account. Strengthening the
Government's contract management capacity and capability would promote private
sector participation in road maintenance.
*   Public sector based equipment rehabilitation programs do not work. The failure of
the various efforts of the Government to implement this component have led to a
decision to leave this to the private sector.






PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENTIEVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Objectives
1.    The objectives of the project, which formed part of the Borrower's Transport
Sector Investment Program (FY1986-FY1988) were to: (a) support the Borrower's efforts
towards improvement in the efficiency of its transport operations and maintenance; and (b)
expand the effective capacity in its territory in order to assist the Borrower in its efforts to
rehabilitate its economy, particularly the agricultural sector.
The project consisted of the following components:
(i) Road rehabilitation program
(a)   Rehabilitation of six sections of the Tanzam highway totaling 295 kms;
(b)   Rehabilitation of 700 kms to 1000 kms of gravel roads; and
(c)   Provision of technical assistance for the supervision of construction of the
above works.
(ii)   Equipment rehabilitation program:
(a)   Rehabilitation of inoperative road maintenance equipment and vehicles; and
(b)   Provision of technical assistance for the supervision of the above activities
and reorganization and strengthening of six zonal workshops and the
central workshop at Morogoro.
(iii)  Technical assistance to MCW:
(a)   Strengthening the capabilities of the Borrower's Ministry of
Communications and Works by the provision of technical assistance in
project coordination, training, road maintenance, and equipment
management and service.
(iv)   Training:
(a)   Provision of fellowships for training abroad of engineers, planning officers
and other professionals of MCW;
(b)   Establishment of a three-year highway technicians course for about twenty-
five highway technicians at the Dar-es-Salaam Technical College;



2
(c)   Training of existing field supervisory personnel at the Morogoro Training
School; and
(d)   Preparation and supervision of annual in-service training program for
MCW staff,
(v)   Assistance to Contracting Industry:
(a)   Training of local contractors, in the areas of cost estimation, preparation of
bids, site management, methods of execution of roadwork and contractual
obligations; and
(b)   Technical assistance to local contractors in carrying out periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation works.
(vi)   Assistance to Trucking Industry:
(a)   Strengthening of public regional trucking companies by the provision of
technical assistance in the areas of management, accounts, vehicles
maintenance and vehicles repair, and in assisting in the execution of Part 2
below; and
(b)   Provision of spare parts, tires and batteries for both public and private
truck operators;
(vii)  Studies:
(a)   Carrying out of feasibility studies and detailed engineering of sections of
the Chalinze-Segera-Mkumbara, Tanga-Segera and Arusha-Moshi roads;
and
(b)   Carrying out an agricultural feeder roads study.
2.    Given the deteriorated state of the country's high priority trunk road, the complete
lack of maintenance on the rural/feeder roads and the urgent need to alleviate constraints
in the movement marketing and export of agricultural products, the project objectives
were clear and important for the sector, and in line with the Association's country
strategy.
Project Implementation and Organization.
3.    The Department of Roads under the MWCT was in charge of the project's
implementation. The assistance to the local contracting industry was implemented by the
National Construction Council (NCC) under the direction of the MWCT. Similarly, the
assistance to the trucking industry was implemented by National Transport Corporation



3
(NTC) under the direction of MWCT. A project coordinator from MWCT was
responsible for overall coordination of the various project elements and disbursements of
the credits funded by IDA and AfDF. IDA managed NORAD funds through a trust fund
agreement.
Project Restructuring
4.   In November 1989, the Bank and the Government agreed to the following
substantial changes:
(i) revise the financial participation of IDA in rehabilitating road maintenance
equipment and civil works, in order to reduce Government participation in
the project costs to about 10 percent (from 20 percent as appraised), and
to bring the cost share in line with the subsequently appraised Integrated
Roads Project (IRP);
(ii) increase scope of works, by widening unpaved roads and asphalt chip
sealing of paved roads shoulders. With increased IDA participation in roads
works to a more realistic percentage for a country in Tanzania's economic
situation, and increased scope of works, the number of kilometers of gravel
roads had to be reduced, from 700 kms-1,000 kms to 130 kms. Since the
preparation of IRP was well underway, those works not contracted under
this project were rolled over to IRP.
(iii) increase the total length of the sections of TANZAM Highway to be
rehabilitated, from 295 kms to 370 kms. This was result of the additional
financing provided under this project by the Government of Norway; for
rehabilitation of section 5 of the TANZAM Highway;
(iv) increase from $500,000 to $1,000,000 the upper limit amount for contracts
used for training of domestic contractors in road works;
(v) provide MCWT with greater flexibility in the procurement procedures to
carry out the equipment rehabilitation component; and
(vi) permit direct contracting of equipment repairs with local garages.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Physical Objectives
5.    The project initiated a program to help reduce transport as a constraint facing the
Tanzanian economy, through the rehabilitation of the most important sections of the



4
highway network. The economic recovery could not be sustained unless the transport
costs are reduced and accessibility to the primary agricultural areas are improved.
6.    The project, as restructured, substantially met its objectives for the road
rehabilitation component, especially the part funded by IDA and NORAD. However, it
only partially achieved its objectives for the technical assistance and training components.
Further, it failed to meet its objectives for the equipment rehabilitation component.
7.    The rehabilitation of 370 kms of Tanzam Highway restored a portion of the
principal artery of the country to a maintainable condition. The vehicle operating costs
were reduced in average by at least 30 percent for all the rehabilitated roads. The
Economic Rate of Return is calculated at 41 percent for Tanzam Highway, compared to
39 percent at appraisal, and at 37 percent for the gravel roads, compared to 27 percent at
appraisal. Section 1 of Tanzam Highway, was in better condition than the others and has
therefore the highest rate of return (75 percent). The data provided indicated a high traffic
increase on Tanzam Highway (almost three times more than the appraisal estimates),
which is due to the observed higher economic activity and to the improvement of the road
sections (Tables 9 and 9A).
8.    With respect to institutional development, major improvements were achieved:
(i) the Ministry was able to fill the vacant positions identified at the appraisal of IRP; and
(ii) the project increased the availability of trained engineers in Tanzania. About 80
undergraduate engineers were trained, 20 of which obtained academic degrees at M.Sc
level. These engineers were added to the pool of engineers needed to implement the
Integrated Roads Project. A study on agricultural feeder roads provided the basis for
successful institutional restructuring of the organization of the MWCT, creating a new
rural roads division with a task of supervising the Core Rural Roads Program (CRRP).
9.    The assistance to the Local Contracting Industry enabled the Borrower to
strengthen the local construction industry. Local contractors acquired training in project
management, budgeting, and preparation of bidding documents. Some of these
contractors are now undertaking civil works under IRP.
10.   The project continued the effort started under the previously successful IDA-
financed project (Cr 743-TA); to expand the capacity and to improve the efficiency of the
trucking industry. The assistance to the trucking industry was comprised of technical
assistance, especially accountants and mechanics, and the provision of spare parts, tires
and workshops tools for the Regional Trucking Companies (RETCOs).
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS
AFFECTING THE PROJECT
11.   All the components commenced with delays ranging from 5 to 24 months. Initial
delays were mainly caused by slowness of MWCT, MOF, A.G. Chambers and Central
Tender Board (CTB), in the engagement of consultants and in procuring goods and



5
works. This led to the inclusion under IRP of a comprehensive study to overhaul the
Government's procurement and supply management system, preceded by agreement
between GOT and IDA of interim procurement regulations, standard procurement
documents, and more realistic procurement decision-making limits at ministry and regional
levels.
12.   The roads works proved to be a major source of delays, due to inadequate and
poorly prepared engineering designs. As a result, significant changes occurred in the field
and the actual costs of roads works were above the appraisal estimates. To deal with this
cost overrun and actual needs of the transport sector, the project scope was amended and
the road rehabilitation was concentrated on Tanzam Highway; which was expanded to
370 kms. The scope of the gravel road rehabilitation was reduced from about 1000 kms
to 130 kms, while the remaining components were transferred to the subsequent appraised
Integrated Roads Project (IRP). The economic rationale behind this choice of giving the
priority to Tanzam Highway over the gravel roads is neither clear nor documented.
Alternatively, a total of total 370 kms of Tanzam Highway and 110 kms of gravel roads
were rehabilitated. The rehabilitation of gravel roads started about 32 months behind
schedule. The main causes of delays were i) scarcity of equipment, ii) weak local
contractor performance, iii) lengthy period to contract consultants, and iv) under-
estimation of time needed for preparing detailed engineering.
13.   There was a delay of about 24 months in the commencement of the rehabilitation
of inoperative road maintenance equipment and vehicles. The delay was caused by weak
management within MWCT and delays in procurement decisions. Specifically, the
Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) and the Central Tender Board (CTB) delayed in
approving negotiated contracts with private garages for repair of MWCT's road
maintenance equipment. Based on the agreed amendment to the credit agreement, in
November 1989, which allowed negotiated contracts, as well as IDA funding 100 percent
of the equipment transport and repair costs, agreement among AGC and MWCT was
obtained to facilitate procedures for repair contracts and spare parts purchases. However,
CTB rejected MWCT's appointment of a procurement agent selected through procedures
agreed with IDA. This task is now managed by the Government owned Plant and
Equipment Hire Company (PEHCOL).
14.   DANIDA financed the strengthening of the capabilities of MWCT through the
provision of technical assistance, consisting of 4 advisors in project coordination, training,
road maintenance equipment management, and road maintenance programming.
15.   The training program at the Morogoro training School had a slow start up due to
delays in the completion of the training facilities. The training component is being
continued under IRP with IDA funding for a further two years.
16.   The assistance to the trucking industry sector had three components: (i) supply of
spare parts, (ii) supply of tires and batteries; and (iii) technical assistance. Procurement of
4,800 batteries and 8,500 sets of tire tubs and flaps has been completed and distributed to
transport operators by the local supply agents.



6
17.   The assistance to the local contracting industry faced slow initial implementation
because the trainees did not have any experience in roads works, maintenance and project
budgeting.
18.   All the studies were completed on time and more studies emerged from the
implementation of the project including: (i) a feasibility study for trunk roads covering
3,000 kms of gravel trunk roads; (ii) pavement management study on Tanzam Highway;
(iil) bridge and ferry crossing study covering all trunk road bridges and ferry crossings in
the country; (iv) Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) study; and (v) Chalinze-Arusha
Road feasibility study. The agricultural feeder roads study (financed by DANIDA) was
completed on time and has identified some 1,300 kms of Core Rural Roads to be
rehabilitated under IRP. The above study has been succeeded by the Core Rural Roads
Study as part of a DANIDA-financed O&M study which has provided engineering design
for 622 kms of rural roads and training of local consultants in rural road rehabilitation
design.
19.   Delays were also caused by the rejection by the Ministry of Finance of negotiated
contracts with international consultants for short-term studies, because the firms would
not be subject to Tanzanian taxes. An agreement was reached with the Ministry of
Finance to exempt foreign consultants from taxation.
20.   The MOF's regulations did not allow local contractors to receive foreign currency
for importing parts, materials and contracted works. This affected local firms when
competing against foreign firms, and severely hampered efforts to develop the local
industry.
21.   There was lack of agreement with the Bank on the method of application of import
duties and taxes for road contracts awarded through ICB.
22.   The project had to be restructured as a result of the increased scope of work, e.g.
widening of unpaved roads and asphalt chip sealing of paved road shoulders. The number
of kilometers of gravel roads had to be reduced from 1,000 kms to 130 kms. Since
preparation of the Integrated Roads Project (IRP) was well underway, the work not
contracted under this project was rolled over to IRP. NORAD increased its contribution
from US$ 6.9 million to US$ 17.1 million to finance an additional section of Tanzam
Highway, increasing the total length of the road sections to be rehabilitated from 295 mns
to 370 kms.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABIUTY
23.   The project, as restructured, achieved its purpose by beginning the rehabilitation of
Tanzania's trunk roads as a forerunner to the massive road rehabilitation program under
subsequent IRP, as well as by providing the mechanism for implementing studies to
support IRP and the Railways Restructuring Projects. Actions taken by the Government
under the IRP, will deternine the sustainability of the system established for maintaining



7
the main road network. The rapid increase in traffic volumes and loads since IRP, that
commenced in the 1990s, will require special attention by MWCT in implementing the
periodic reshaping and regravelling of unpaved roads and resealing and overlays of paved
roads; especially for the highly trafficked Tanzawn Highway. If the maintenance system
improvements are successful, the achievements generated by the Sixth Highway project
are likely to be maintained.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
24.   The project was identified, prepared and appraised at the time when the country's
transport system was in disarray. The Association helped develop a program for the
rehabilitation/strengthening of the country's vital trunk roads and institutional
strengthening of various Government agencies. The Association's performance in project
identification, as well as in the project preparation was satisfactory. It also assisted the
Government in mobilizing donors to finance other components under the project. The
Bank's supervision performance was generally satisfactory. The number of staff weeks
required for the supervision of the project was doubled from the estimates given at the
appraisal stage. The Association's supervision effort was adequate in spite of the lack of
continuity in project supervision due to frequent changes in task management
responsibilities. Five task managers and three Division Chiefs were involved during the
implementation of the project. However, project implementation progress reporting was
adequate and the performance rating given in Forms 590 appropriate, although in the last
stages of project implementation when IRP started, supervision efforts were shifted from
this project to IRP.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
25.   The Borrower's performance in project preparation was satisfactory. During
implementation, general progress was behind schedule because of lack of experience of the
contractors and because of constant changes in scope of works as a result of inadequate
design documentation. Starting 1991, implementation performance has been improved as
a result of the parallel implementation of IRP. The Government showed its resolve in
addressing problems facing both projects. On the institutional side, trunk and regional
roads have been brought under common management of the Director of Roads and
Aerodromes. Regional Engineers Offices have been firmly established and staffing has
been adequate. On resource mobilization, a Road Fund was established in July 1991 to
finance road maintenance and rehabilitation with revenues derived from a levy on fuel
sales. These improvements have encouraged private sector provision of transport services
and facilitated the movement of freight and passengers throughout the country. The
Project Coordination Office ensured a successful coordination among donors, and
managed effectively and timely payments from IDA Special Accounts, disbursement
applications, project progress and auditing reports.

G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
26.   The project outcome was satisfactory since the project substantially met its
objectives for the paved road rehabilitation component. With this project providing
invaluable experience to MWCT, the ministry is better prepared to manage and contract
IRP's massive investments. Additionally, with regards to institutional development, the
project increased the availability of trained engineers in Tanzania. Further, the assistance
to the Local Contracting Industry enabled the Borrower to improve the local construction
industry. Training of contractors and local engineers was important and essential and is
being utilized under IRP.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
27.   The Integrated Roads Project, which is in two phases, IRP I and IRP AL is a
radical new approach for improvement of transport sector in the country. The supervision
of both projects is in progress. The objective of IRP in general is to restore Tanzania's
trunk and regional roads network and to strengthen the MWCT's institutional capacity to
properly maintain the networks. IDA continues to support this objective under IRP I by
giving priority to road maintenance, expanding the domestic construction industry,
improving management and procurement practices in the roads subsector, and mobilizing
and coordinating the substantial resources required to support the program.
X. KEY LESSONS LEARNED.
28.   Lessons learned from the project are:
*    Undertake main institutional changes prior to project effectiveness. The structure of
road administration has been subject to frequent changes during the implementation
of the project. The result of these changes was confusion, poorly organized planning
administration and ineffective long-term institutional and work force development.
Therefore, main institutional and policy changes, including reorganization and
institutional reinforcement of roads administration, as well as changes in the
procurement regulations should be undertaken prior to project effectiveness.
*   Phase policy changes with implementation progress. Physical progress is often
needed to highlight the needed changes. It would be appropriate to annually review
the program and to phase it with implementation progress, using subsequent fund
releases based on continuing institutional reforms and strengthening.
*   Re-evaluate the engineering design of the roads works before commencement of
project. inadequate engineering design of roads works and weak documentation
caused substantial changes in the field, delays in the implementation, and cost



9
overruns. A careful reevaluation of the engineering design prior to actual
commencement of works would avoid such delays and cost overruns.
•   Link the approval of civil works for the roads financed by IDA with the Government
agreed annual road budget. Road networks are deteriorating faster than the level of
investments to rehabilitate and to maintain them. Therefore, the Government should
invest more in timely periodic road maintenance works, while IDA's contribution
should be for road rehabilitation and upgrading projects.
*   Establish a maintenance strategy for the roads. No project can be sustained without
policy and institutional reforms for proper maintenance strategy for the roads
network.
*   Improve the regulatory environment to stimulate the development of the private
sector. An important objective of the project was to carry out major maintenance
and rehabilitation works by contract rather than by force account. Strengthening the
Government's contract management capacity and capability would promote private
sector participation in road maintenance.
•   Public sector based equipment rehabilitation programs do not work. The failure of
the various efforts of the Government to implement this component have led to a
decision to leave this to the private sector.

IL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF ROAD WORKS
2.01 Tanzam Highway
The Tanzam Highway leaves a very much different impression now, as the repairs carried out by
Noremco/NodestlNorconsult along the approx. 330 km from Ruaha River to Igawa have complemented the
already rehabilitated sections. It is appreciated that the impact of the recent works is very good, at a total cost
of about USS 2 million.
2.02 For Sections 1, 2 and 3A only the signs are still missing, whereas the road markings are complete. The
issue of speed control through Mikumi National Park (Section 2) has premiously been raised by the park
authorities, but proposed measures were very strong and unrealistic. However, at present no precautions to
reduce the adverse effects of the high speeds after the rehabilitation were seen. It is explained that less animals
are appearing along the road after the rehabilitation was completed, possbly because of the high speeds induce
fear.
2.03    Section 4 is substantiasly complete, and only signs and markings are remaining except for some
additional works for erosion protection not included in the contract. The Contractor expects to reach full
completion about December 20. AR interim certificates have been approved, and payment for the last one only
is not yet received The Contractor has also submitted several claims of a total value of about US$ 4 million,
but explains that no answers have yet been received. First claim was submitted two years bacl, and the last one
in June this year.
2.04   A general problem connected to the design of the shoulders in suburban areas was seen in Mbeya as
traffic from accesses and pedestrans are breaking the edge and the surface dressing of the shoulder. Another
design problem seems to be the pavement mix in hills, as in the hill near Inyala Pumping Station there were
clear indications on creep due to an unstable mix. Unless the problem is looked into and corrected similar
pavement conditions as in the Kitonga Gorge may develop. The gradient of the hill seemed to be 8-1l0/%. The
same problem was also noticed developing in the hills of Wami Bridge along the Chalinae-Segera Highway in
Coast Region. It is agreed that the Ministry should identify the mechanisms behind the creep/flow probleni.
and come up with a proposal for eventual countermeasures and precautions for ongoing design and works
within five months.
2.05   Section 5 was completed after the last mission to that area. and works and completion seemed to be
excellent. The only problem, which has got nothing to do with the rehabilitation, is that at Chimala Bridge the
silting up of the riverbed is so extensive that only about 1,5m is left of the height under the bridge. This type of
brdge is not designed to handle side forces, and it may be washed away during the rains if current will become
strong enough. There are other places with similar situation, and the problem should be looked into.
2.06 However, there are still sections that need major works to be undertaken, like:
i)    The 80 km from Songwe to Tunduma in Mbeya Region that remains with a significant lower
standard, and which needs a combination of reconstruction, rehabilitation and resurfacing. Full
rehabilitation is indicated to be at a cost of about USS 10 million.
ii)    The 12 km steep Section 3B through Kitonga Gorge needs a new pavement as the present one has
extensive creeping/flowing due to instabilitv in the mix. It is understood that a new pavement design
is being prepared. The structure of the road except from the top layer is good
iii)   The interim section Chalinze-Melela (Morogoro) is at present being maintained by filling potholes.
but the whole section should be resurfaced, and rehabilitated in some obvious weak sections.
iv)    The remaining 55 km of Section 1 (AFDC) between Ubungo (DSM) and Miandizi will need major
works according to the completed design. This section has been shortened due to increases in works
and costs for the part where works have been camed out.



6
It is agreed that the present status of the Tanzam should be summarized, and packaging proposed for
remaining types and scope of works including cost estimates be presented bv the Ministry to the donor
community.
Himo-Arusha Rehabilitation Project
2.07   The Contractor is Federici, Consultant is Norconsult International. The rehabilitation is financed by
AfDB and the consultancy services bv NORAD. The project is 5 months behind schedule.
The pavement design was modified for this project after signing the contract due to the availability of suitable
materials. The relevant changes in rates were negotiated and presented to the Ministry, and the contractor
informed about his intention to present a claim for extension of time due to the time spent for approval of new
pavement design. The no-objection has been given by AfDB for the changes, but there is no overall change in
contract value due to the change in design. There are obvious advantages from a construction point of view for
the contractor to use bitumen stabilized base rather than penetrated macadam.
2.08   Due to a review of the road safety aspects of the original design of the project a number of changes
outside the road itself has come up, like pedestrian facilities, parking areas and reduction of accesses.
Himo-Holili, and Himo-Marangu Rehabilitation Projects
2.09  The Contractor is Noremco. Consultant Norconsult International, and the rehabilitation are financed by
NORAD. Works proceeding well, including the three spans Whuna bridge. Consumption of bitumen in
stabilized gravel was about 5,2% that is rather high.
Babati Area Roads, Singida-Shelui Section
2.10   This is one of the three sections of the Babati Area Roads Contract. The total length of the Project
initially was 310 km of rehabilitated roads. Due to very heavy traffic and poor materials quality, it was agreed
to realign the Singida-Shelui Section and to change the initial scope of works from gravel rehabilitation of the
original road alignment to a standard whereby the bitumenization is to take place at a later stage.
2.11   Also the original aligmnent of the existing road through the Sekenke escarpment was not adequate to
the functional importance of the major link of the Central Comdor, thus causing numerous traffic accidents
and loss of lives and property. The contractor Messes Ladwa was instructed to embark on the related additional
works, without the formal consent of the Bank. The additional works resulted in significant increase of the
original cost.and change of the original contract rates for the new items of works. V. O .NO.7 was issued to the
contractor by the Engineer in June 93 taking into consideration the new rates and the claims of the contractor
in respect of the new alignment, based on the agreed quantities.
2.12   The May 94 mission requested MWCT to justify the new adopted rates and to compare them with the
rates accepted in similar contracts. The document in this respect was presented to the mission (letter dated
November 15. 1994).
It is agreed that MWCT will resubmit the document and clearly define additional works excluding the claims
submitted by the contractor, as well as to estimate total expected costs for the completion of the project also
considering price adjustment up to the completion of the project. The mission noted that the present extension
of time will end on December 18, 1994 and that the contractor has requested a new extension of time since the
work will continue throughout 1995. It was further agreed that the MWCT will review the situation and seek
legal advice through the consultant to avoid additional claims in this respect, and the Mission recommends
that the issue of extension of time is given proper attention.
2.13   At this point of time, it is clear that the total cost of the project has increased substantially and that the
total funds provided for the project will be adequate for the completion of about 88.0 km. of the road instead of
the originally planned 310.0 km. The contractor has recentlI increased the overall production by injecting new
equipment, however the sustain ability of his efforts necds to be closelv monitored.



7
2.14   Consulting engineer Messes Dorsch expects completion in May 1995. while the mission is of opinion
that the end of 1995 is more realistic date. The mission is further of opinions that the supervision on site is to
be intensified in order to enable proper and timely reaction of the Client if and when required.
Tanga - Horoboro and Marangu - Tarakea Road Rehabilitation
2.15   This road represents the major link between Mombasa, Kenya and Tanga - Dar es Salaam Area. Total
length is 68 km. Contract for the rehabilitation was signed on 20 December 1993 with Messes Sietco and the
contractual period for the completion of the construction is August 1995. The take off the contractor was long
delayed due to non availability of required equipment by the contractor.
2.16   Furthermore, the contractor seems to be lacking experience in construction in tropical areas and of
proper organization. The stretches of the road that he substantially completes being not properly maintained.
lose its shape and deteriorate fast, before the road stretch can be handed over to the client. Lack of the
eqtuipment, specifically loaders and trucks are slowing the progress of works. Estimated delay as of today is
more than three months. Since the contractor was awarded the construction contract comprising of the two
sections of a distance of approxinate 500 km apart, it will be most unlikely if the second part of the contract
will start before the first part is at least substantially completed. Lack of the equipment and proper
management may cause more delays.
2.17    The mission advised MWCT to issue a warning letter to the contractor and to ensure that proper
measures are taken to avoid eventual loss of more time for the construction and possible claim from the
contractor. It is obvious that the consultant will need an extension of time and additional inputs for the
supervision if the contractor commences with the second part of this project now
2.18    The mission urges MWCT to consider the road upgrading to a bituminous road considering the
importance of the road and expected heavy traffic volume. Reference is also made to para 2 19.
Otber Gravel Roads Contracts
2.19  There is a number of gravel roads' contracts in the program. originally under Sixth Highway program:
i)     Babati Area Roads, 310 km, ongoing on reduced length of 88 Km
ii)    Tunduma-Sumbawanga. 230 km. completed
iii)    Usagara-Lusahunga, 270 km, ongoing
iv)    Tanga-Horohoro, 68 km, ongoing
v)     Marangu-Tarakea, 52 km, not yet started. but included in same contract as iv)
The general experiences are that the rate of wearing of gravel pavements along these roads is very fast, and
there is a general concern that some stabilization of the surface needs to be done in order to reduce the gravel
loss.
In Mbeva the Regional Engineer expressed concerns to the mnission about the Tunduma-Sumbawvanga Road.
The RE has previously proposed bitumenization of the road. but funding situation has not allowed any works
of that sort except from a short section within Tunduma village that was included in the contract.
It is agreed that MWCT by end of January, 1995 submit a proposal to the Bank concerning all the gravel road
contracts in order to stop the fast deterioration of the pavements, including economic analysis and estimated
ERRs.
2.20  Dares Salaam Region-Emergency Road Repair Program
The Program initially comprised of 9 packages. Packages 5 and 8 have been canceled and only 7 packages are
presently under construction. The originally foreseen construction period is now in its 35th month. which is
more than double. The original concept of periodic maintenance and emergency repair was discarded early in



8
the Program as the roads scheduled for emergency repairs and for periodic maintenance required full road
width construction, additional drainage facilities and heavier pavement. It is expected that serious flood
prevention deficiencies should be corrected as well as that several major hydraulic structures/bridges will be
constructed. There has been serious flooding in each of the past three years that caused overtopping of several
of the Program roads threatening catastrophic washout.
2.21    Out of seven packages, three packages (1, 7 and 9) are completed. The remaining packages are in
different stages of completion; as follows:
Package 2: substantially completed. expected completion end 94,
Package 3: 70% completed, expected completion 2/95.
Package 4: 75% completed, expected completion 4/95.
Package 6: 65% completed, expected completion 2/95.
Overall completion of the Program is 85%.
The main causes for the massive delay in the execution were identified as:
(i)    not adequate design documentation available for the construction as a result of emergency situation
(ii)   lack of experience of the contractors for the type of work required
(iii)   lack of working capital and financial resources of the local contractors
(iv)    major changes of scope of works during the construction
(v)    non-availability of good quality wearing course material because of poor quality of materials
(Package 9) and because of high increases in traffic flow as characteristically
for urban and semi-urban areas.
(vi)   delays in issuing contract amendments
Contractor Performance
2.22    For package 2, the new Contractor is performing well. In respect to the initial Contractor for this
package, the Mission received information that the performance bond has been pursued with the National
Insurance Company. The mission urges MWCT to resolve the issues, otherwise the mission will not be able to
recommend further use of NIC bonds for IDA-financed projects
Cost increase
2.23    Total cost of the works has been significantly increased. The estimated cost of the works has been
received from supervising engineer taking into consideration the outstanding works to be done. The total cost
of the original works (all packages excluding package 5 ) was Shs. 2.996 billion. Total value of works expected
as of 11/94 is Shs. 4,208 billion in addition to the extra payments in respect of the fluctuations/interest on
delayed payments and other costs totaling to Shs. 0,655 billion. Total expected cost to the completion of the
works is estimated to Shs. 6,043 billion (4,905 billion for the works and Shs. 1.138 billion for extras).
2.24  Because of the increase in quantities and extension of time, contract addenda have been prepared for all
contract packages as well as for the consultants contract. Payments have been stopped to several contractors
and the consultant pending signature of the Addenda. It was agreed that MWCT is to finalize the approval of
addenda at latest by the end of January. 1995.
Mbauda-Losinyai Road, Arusha Region
2.25   This was one of the few rural roads the mission Nisited during this field trip. The Contractor is N1,S
Milkha Singh. and supervision is provided by REO. Works contracted are regravelling of 45 km at a total
contract value of Shs 358.188 million. and works conmuenced in July. 1994. Road width is 5,5m, and design
camber is said to be only 4%. A gravel road w&ith that camber and compaction will after short time become
almost flat and water run-off will becone a problem. Also the general drainage situation of the section Nisited



9
was difficult as the side terrain was flat, but it was explained that the longitudinal gradient was sufficient for
the ditches.
Development Budget 1994/95
2.26 The development expenditures for the local component the last quarter FY 1993/94 were presented
(Annex IV), which shows no major change between planned and approved figures. Total expenditures of the
year were Shs 3.849,7 million.
The Development Budget for FY1994/95 is also presented in Annex IV, and out of the proposed Shs 5.6
billion about Shs 4,5 billion was approved. Already about Shs 2 billion was spent during the first quanrr that
is about half of the allocation of the year. This trend has to be monitored very carefully.
Overall Status of Trunk Roads Upgrading and Rehabilitation Projects
2.27    Annex I provide the status of trunk roads upgrading and rehabilitation projects as of September 30,
1994. General progress is behind schedule and especially gravel roads have poor progress due to compaction
water problems on the Usagara-Lusahunga site, intensive works at Sekenke escarpment, and poor contractor
performance on Tanga-Horohoro Section.
Overall status of Rural Roads Upgrading and Rehabilitation Projects
2.28 Annex 11 provides the status of rural roads upgrading and rehabilitation projects as of June 30, 1994
that shows an overall performance of 68% of planned length, whereas about 490%o of total budget were
disbursed.
ImL MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING
Maintenance Programming
3.01    The previous critical situation for the Tanzam is now stabilized, and the need of a maintenance
program becomes more obvious. Such a prgram should not only deal with the pavement itself as a defective
drainage system often is the reason behind the defects. The impression from the field trip is that the whole
Tanzam should be inspected with the view to improve the side drains, and especially along the recent repaired
sections. Also for some section's bush affecting the shoulder should be cleared, especially noted along Section I
and interim section between 3A and 3B.
Maintenance Funding
3.02 The agreed maintenance funding for FY 1994/95 is US$ 34.257 million (Donor contribution USS 5.5
million and GOT USS 28,8 million), as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report for IRPII. During the budget
session the Treasury allocated only 11 billion Shs., or USS 22 million, to be collected from the fuel levy.
Since July I the collections have increased due to an increase in the levy from 30 to 35 Shs/litter, and the
MWCT allocation has been increased to Shs 15,187 billion (USS 30,375 million) which represents 80% of the
levy to be collected for this financial year; 20% goes to the Prime Minister's Office for development and feeder
roads maintenance and rehabilitation.
Additional to this Shs 1 billion (US$ 2 million) has been allocated from other sources, which will bring the
total expected maintenance allocation to USS 32,37 million.
A review of the present funding situation was presented to the Mission (Annex 3). The review shows that about
USS 30 million will be collected from the fuel levy for FY1994/95 by maintaining the present level of levy. In
addition, maintenance funding support from other donors and agencies is of about USS 16.5 million. Together
with the ordinary GOT allocation to Overheads and Administration in the DRA of US$ 2 million mentioned
above, this will bring the total maintenance budget up to USS 48.8 million out of which about



10
USS 40 million is directed to maintenance works.
Phase I of the study for broadening the revenue base of the Road Fund to meet future maintenance
requirement in accordance with IRP targets is just about to start. The study will determine the most appropnate
measures to increase revenue to the Road Fund through:
(I)    Transit Charges of heavy vehicles from other countries, and
(ii)   Heavy vehicle license fee from Tanzanian registered vehicles
Maintenance Monitoring
3.03 The existing monitoring system for maintenance operations needs improvements. Whereas it is easy to
keep records for the allocation of funds to the regions, the monitoring system for how the funds have been
spent is not sufficient, which especially is due to an insufficient accounting system in the Regional Engineers
Offices (REOs). The issue is already looked into as a part of the identified subjects to be focused on by the
Management Action Group (MAG); the accounting systems already operating in Mbeya and Tanga should be
looked into by MAG.
Maintenance Operations
3.04   The eight regions Iringa, Mbeya. Morogoro, Dodoma, Shinyanga, Coast, Kilimanjaro and Tanga have
recently received some light eqmupment for paved road pothole patching to be carried out by force account. The
equipment is supplied as complete units with small tippers, rollers/compactors, mini excavator/back hoe,
compressor, pick-up, bitumen heater, and various handtools. The mission could already see the units in
operation in Iringa and Morogoro regions.
3.05   Driving along the Same-Himo Road it was noticed that serious erosion had taken place downstream of
culvert outlets especially in Mwanga District due to the heavy rainfall in April this year. It was also noted that
the road markings had become very faint, and will soon disappear. Other types of materials should be used as
center-line marking; such markings are effective in reducing speed with a reduction effect on the number of
road accidents.
3.06    Mbeya and Tanga Regions are still maintaining a different works organization than other regions
whereby more of the works are executed by force account. It should be noted that while typical regravelling
works in Tanpa are carried out at a cost of Shs 6,7 million/km by force account, the typical cost is said to be
above that for contracts.
Maintenance Organization
3.07    At present maintenance responsibilities in MWCT are distributed to three sections, Trunk Roads
Section, Rural Roads Section and Programnuing Section. Along with other proposals for reorganizing the
Ministry. and in order to improve the maintenance organization, the MWCT has proposed the establishment of
a new Maintenance Section under DRA The proposal is at present with the Civil Service Depatment for
approval. The section will have the responsibilities for all maintenance activities, planning, supervision and
monitoring. This restructuring of the Mnistry is urgently needed to improve efficiency and better monitoring
of maintenance work.
IV. SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
Regional Engineer's Offices (REO)
4.01    The mission visited eight regions and held discussions with the Regional Engineers. The main
conclusions are as follows:



11
(i)    The implementation capabilities of REOs have improved significantly, therefore the organization and
management can efficiently carry out their duties.
(ii)    The funds from the Road Fund are released promptly and in accordance to planned activities. Some of
the regions this financial year has received reduced payments due to the agreed deduction in respect to
debts to PEHCOL.
(iii)   The funds required for payments of the administrative expenses of the offices are not fully available
from the general fund, therefore the road fund money is partly financing them. In average, about 50%
percent of these expenses is taken from the Road Fund.
(iv)    Technical assistance is most welcomed by the REOs and should be considered for all regions.
(v)    Reporting and monitoring of the expenditures and its classification is not adequate and this aspect
should be emphasized and looked into by MWCT HQ. The mission urges MWCT to pay attention to
the accounting, reporting and monitoring capabilities of the REOs.
Road Safety
4.02   The Road Safety Master Plan Document is to be prepared by Design Partnership, Dar es Salaam. The
contract is financed by NORAD. The final document is expected to be submitted in April, 1995, and will
contain long term strategies and plan for the next ten years.
4.03   The road accident recording system MAAP has so far been installed in Dar es Salaam, Mbeya and
Tanga. and the Police have received the necessary training to operate the system. In the regions the Planning
Engineer is the Regional Road Safety Coordinator.
4.04   The numbers of accidents along the Chalinze-Segera-Tanga Road have been high since the road was
completed, but seems recently to have stabilized. DANIDA has provided a funding of Shs 35 million for road
safety countermeasures. REO Tanga will await implementation until the accident situation has been analyzed.
Weight Control
4.05   During the field trip the weigh-bridge at Makambako (Tanzam) was visited, and clearly the present
lack of effectiveness of weigh-bridges in providing protection for the roads needs the highest attention. Only 2
of the about 50 heavy trucks passing at the Tanzam were recorded to have entered the bay for checking. There
is also no off-loading of the overload The mission was informed that the strategy of initiating action has been
to control international traffic at entry points.
4.06   The procurement issue of weigh-bridges was discussed with the mission. MWCT will decide which
tvpe of contract is more suitable, either one contract combining civil works and supply/erection, or separate
contracts for civil works and for supply/erection.
4.07   Mobile weighing scales need to have a capacity of 40 tons. It appears that there is only one suitable
supplier of this equipment. A statement in this respect will be needed. The Ministry is preparing with NORAD
TA. a comprehensive program for IDA consideration.
Contracting procedures
4.08   The impression from most of the regions is that the present contracting procedures still take a long
time such that works to be contracted usually change considerably during preparation. MWCT should look into
the issue and identify the possibilities for impros-ing the situation. However. recent contracts by Regional
Tender Boards in Kagera, Mwanza and Tanga have been processed within a few weeks.



12
Central Materials Laboratory
4.09   The TA to Central Materials Laboratory for the past vear is about to leave, at the same time as a
twinning arrangement with the Norwegian Road Research Laboratory has been formulated under the umbrella
of the Road Sector Program funded by NORAD. Looking into contract and project performance there is no
doubt that materials technology is crucial input to project preparation and management that needs substantial
strengthening, and from an engineering point of view one of the most important. The Ministry needs to
struengthen CML to ensure that the issue will be given the highest attention.
NTC and Road Transport Matters
4.10   NTC has signed the consultancy agreement with IBIS Transport Management Services for the study
on Restructuring Road Transport Services in Tanzania. The Inception Report was prepared and submitted.
The recommendations will be presented to the Board of Directors of NTC shortly. The recommendations of
the study should provide a basis for the Government to formulate an action plan for the restructuring and
divestiture of RETCO and UDA.
NTC explained to the mission that it is in a process of structuring its corporate plan focusing on its core
business activtties within the context of the on going liberalization process with the aim of divestiture.
Furthermore, NTC management requested continuation of TA services for their offices. They presented the
status report on utilization of funds allocated under IRP I. From the status report it is understood that the
balance available to date is SDR 684,692 for NTC and RETCOs, plus SDR 336,185 for UDA; totaling to US $
1,020,877. It was agreed that NTC will submit a request for the required technical assistance in field of
financinglaccounting and engineering, to MWCT giving enough details for an appraisal of their request,
before sending it to the Bank.
V. SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
5.01    The Credit was closed on October 31, 1994. During the May mission it was discussed with the
Government the arrangements for the preparation of the Borrower's Contribution to the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) in the coming fiscal year. The Borrower was informed of the new policy on the
submission of the ICR to the Board within six months after the closing date, and was provided with the last
version of the Implementation Completion Reporting (OP 13.55 of April 1994). It is agreed that the
Government will make best efforts to send their draft submission to the Bank for review by January 31, 1995.
VL EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT HIRE COMPANY (PEHCOL)
6.01   In spite of significant improvement in PEHCOL's operations and management, the organization
continues to face serious problems because of procurement of spare parts, outstanding debts from the Regional
Offices, frequent breakdown of its old equipment fleet and presently new constraint of having tax exemption
for importation of spare parts from the Ministry of Finance.
The mission noted that number of the previous recommendations was carried out. namely:
(i)    increase in the amount of the special account to cover LCs for PEHCOL's procurement of
spare parts;
(ii)    100%/. advance payment for suppliers for expenditure of up to US $ 100,000, guarantied by a
accepted guarantee;
(iii)  Contracts for procurement of spare parts for values of up of to US $ 300.000 do not require



13
prior approval by IDA. but will be submintted to IDA together with the requests for replenishment of
reimbursement of expenditure. This is related to 'sole source" purchases.
Arrears of Hire Charges
6.02   Total arrears to PEHCOL by REOs as reconciled and agreed is Shs. 463 million. The agreement for
settlement of arrears calls for repayment in 6 consecutive months. The mission found out that some payments
have been affected already to PEHCOL.
Tax Exemption Approvals
6.03   In July 1994 the Government came up with the new procedures in respect of exemption of tax duties.
taking into consideration that the validity of the present exemption will expire on 31st. December, 1994.
Even so, each purchase must obtain an approval from the Ministry of Finance. To date no such approval has
been received by PEHCOL. The system is not yet functioning ,while in the meantime PEHCOL spare parts are
laying in the port not being released. The mission urges MWCT and PEHCOL to find a solution or to consider
a option that PEHCOL pays the tax and gets reimbursed later.
Valuation of Plant and Equipment and Equipment Condition Audit Study
6.04   The Study inclusive of:
(i)    Valuation Report
(ii)    Plant Demand Report
(iii)   Fleet Condition Report
(iv)    Audit Report
Has been submitted to PEHCOL and MWCT. The workshop was held on 4th December 1994 during which
the Study was presented. The Mission was informed that the main conclusions of the Study are (i) 64% of the
plant life are expired, (ii) funds that originally were supposed to be used for rehabilitation of the equipment
should now finance new purchases. The mission urges MWCT and PEHCOL to give their opinion on the
above conclusions and submit them together with the Reporls to the Bank for its review.
Business Plan
6.05   One of the requirements for IRP 11 Credit to become effective is submission to IDA of evidence of the
execution of an agreement between PEHCOL management and it's Board of Directors on performance
indicators to be used for monitoring performance and determining managerial remuneration. The Consultant
is still working on the Studies. The business plan has not yet been presented. PEHCOL informed the mission
that it will be available by the end of December 1994. In the meantime interviews are held for managerial
senior staff recruitment.
MWCT has informed the Bank , by its letter dated November 25, 1994, that the Goverment has already
decided to divestiture PEHCOL by June 1996. In the light of the above MWCT is seeking the Bank's
concurrence that: (i) the action taken by PEHCOL to engage senior management on terms related to
performance indicators, and (ii) the Goverment's agreement to offer PEHCOL for divestiture by June
1996,complies with the intention of the related condition of effectiveness for Credit 2598-TA.

VIL CIVIL AVIATION
Air Tanzania
7.01    Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC) has continuously making its progress in improving its operating and
financial performance. ATC is the first candidate for divestiture under the Government's program for reforms
of the parastatal sector. The need to complete the organizational, operational and financial restructuring is now
even more emphasized as it has held back the development of a divestiture program for the Corporation. ATC
has therefore requested extension of TA contracts that expire this FY; airline's management expert, director of
finance and administration and chief internal auditor, each for a period of twenty-four months. The funding
available under Credit 2149-TA are not adequate to cover the costs of these services. ATC has therefore
requested an additional allocation of about USS 2.4 million (for training of its staff and computerization and
the TA's). In order to assess and eventually agree on this request. the Bank has requested ATC to develop an
action plan for divestiture within a satisfactory timetable including budgetary provision for takeover of the
remaining local currency liabilities. This plan has to be agreed with MWCT before the Bank can consider it.
The submission is expected by the end of December 1994.

INTRODUCTION
1.    Until July 1994 Implementation Completion Report (ICR) were referred to as Project
Completion Reports (PCR) and were spelled out in the Credits as the obligation of the Borrower '
to prepare the draft in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. The guidelines provided in July
1994 which leaves the Borrower only to a comment on the report needs to be reviewed to
include at a chapter that can enable the Borrower to express his views with respect to the
implementation, lessons learned as beneficiary as well as recipient of the credit. The bulk of the
work is undertaken in the Borrower,s own environment and sometimes with varied impact on
the economy of the recipient's country. The Operational Policies 13.55 of April 1994 which
supplements SVPOP/COD No 8 of June 1989 provides under item 3 that the Borrower prepares
and avails to the Bank its own evaluation report within six after the CLOSING DATE on the
project's execution, initial operation, costs and benefits, the Bank's and the Borrower's
performance of their respective obligations under the Loan Agreement and the extent to which
the purposes of the loan were achieved 2. In this respect the closing date agreed with the Bank
for the Sixth Highway (Rehabilitation) Project (Credit 1688-TA) was October 31, 1994.
2.    The areas which the report will concentrate will be (i) project execution; (ii) initial
operations of the project; (iii) costs of the project ( IDA as well as the other Donors);
(iv)benefits derived from the project; (v) borrower's performance; (vi) Bank's performance; and
(v) accomplishments of the project all together. The last part of the report will deal with
conclusions and recommendations if any form the lessons learned from the project.
Project Execution
3.    The Sixth Highway (Rehabilitation) Project was basically a road rehabilitation program.
The main objectives of the project were to rehabilitate deteriorated road sections of the Tanzam
Highway in Tanzania, traversing from Dar es Salaam to Southwest town of Tunduma and
leading to Zambia included in the project were high priority road sections of the country's gravel
trunk road network which were them serving the highly productive Agricultural areas.
For the execution purposes, the project was divided in six major parts including
complimentary components to the road rehabilitation. The parts including the road rehabilitation
are:
i)    -Rehabilitation of 295 Km of the Tanzam Highway out of the 925 Km stretch (i.e.
DSM - Tunduma). Later another 58 Km was added to the project and funded by
NORWAY.
Staff Appraisal Report No. 5922-TA of April 1986 Annex 111-4 P. 59
2  General Conditions Applicable to development Credit Agreements section 9.06(c) refers.



2
-Regravelling of about 700 - 1000 Km of selected gravel trunk road sections.
ii)    Rehabilitation and repair of road construction/maintenance equipment, plant and
vehicles mostly purchased under the IDA credit namely 4th & 5th highway.
iii)   Strengthening of the Ministry's capacity to coordinate, road maintenance, training
and equipment management through provision of Technical Assistance.
iv)   Assistance to the local contracting industry through training of the local
contractors.
v)    Assistance to the Trucking Industry through T.A. as supply of spares and tires.
vi)   Conducting feasibility studies to badly deteriorated road section of the Chalinze-
Segera-Tanga/Arusha road and Agricultural feeder roads in the highly producing
areas.
Initial Operations
4.    The initial operations under the credit started in early January 1987, as the credit was
only effective in December 1986. Prequalification of contractors to undertake the civil works
was completed by January 1987, followed by invitation to bid and planning for starting of the
civil works on sections 2 & 4 of the Tanzam Highway in August 1987. Consultant for design
and supervision of the gravel trunk road rehabilitation was initiated and signed in 1987. On the
equipment repair and rehabilitations a consultancy contract was also signed in 1987. All the
above activities were those funded under credit 1688-T.A. The other donors also respected their
obligations. Civil works under the AfDB on Tanzam Highway section's 1 & 3, contractors were
prequalified in June, 1988.
5.    Part of the Norwegian funds were to be used for sections 2 & 4 while part was provided
for the feasibility studies. These operations started in 1987. T.A. provided by DANIDA to the
Ministry reported to their station in early 1987. Other operations under IDA were the services
to the local construction industry and Transport Industry both of which started in 1987. All the
students (79) earmarked for undergraduate training in Indian Universities started their studies
in 1987.
Costs of the project
6.    The total original project costs was estimated US $ 107.7 million including taxes and
duties. Five agencies contributed forwards the above costs, four of them were Donor Agencies
while the fifth was the govermnent of Tanzania as the borrower's contribution to the project.
Table 1 below summarizes the contribution of each agency. Later the Kingdom of Norway added
another 50 million W. Kroner (bring the total contribution by the Kingdom of Norway to N.Kr.

7.-The project was divided into seven categories in facilitating smooth disb ent. fhe
project component financing was as summarized in table 2 below. However the procurement
procedures followed individual donor agency guidelines. IDA guidelines for the IDA funding
and AfDB guidelines for their funding. Both these agencies ICB conditions governed where
applicable as well as International Shopping. For the other agencies (NORAD & DANIDA)
bilateral agreements were the guidance.

8.    This was the Sixth Highway project financed by the group in the Highway sector. From
financing point of view the funds estimated for this project would not have been enough to
enable the objectives to be attained. The first highway project (1964)3 involved assistance in
constructing about six road sections totalling 860 kms and Technical Assistance as well as
training and ended up with cost overrun which had to be overcome by a supplementary credit
(1968). The problems encountered during implementation namely (i) the delays and reluctance
in recruiting expatriate staff (ii) cultural and language problems experienced by the expatriate
staff and (iii) shortage of adequately qualified local staff as revealed in a Project Performance
Audit Report (PPAR) of 1975 cited in the reference 3 above, were to experienced during the
Third, Fourth and Fifth Highway projects. This project was also the second on the series of IDA
credit/loans funding with co-financing. The first one was credit 142-TA, Loan 586-TA which
had a co-financing of US $ 7.5 million from The Swedish Government being a contribution
towards the construction of some sections on the Tanzam Highway aggregating to 499 kms.
Reports on the execution of this projet conclude that the funds were not only adequate but its
execution was below appraisal costs and the objectives were fully met.
Benefits Derived from the project
9.    There are a number of benefits which emanated from the projects. The first and foremost
is the rehabilitated road sections thus reducing tremendously the vehicle operating costs and
increasing the user benefit. Journey times have been reduced by almost half of what it used to
be before the rehabilitation. Products movement have been eased. The project included an
agricultural feeder road study which resulted into a major institutional change. A new division
was created under the MWCT to facilitate closer and simpler management of the rural roads
network.The entire institutional reform under the MWCT was initiated under the above study
and the change is ongoing.
10.   The basis of the Integrated Roads Project (IRP) was conceived during the implementation
of this project. The study (feasibility and detail engineering) of the Chalinze - Segera - Tanga
and Segera - Moshi - Arusha road was undertaken during the implementation of the same project
and the outcome of these studies are clearly visible benefits to the borrower. Training as
conceived under the project was very successful and beneficial. The implementation capacity in
the Ministry of COMWORKS was found to be inadequate hence the previous projects (Credits
507-TA and 876-TA) addressed the problem by assisting to train more engineer. Under this
3  Staff appraisal Report No.5922-TA of April 1986 Annex 1-2 P 44



5
project another group of engineers were trained in India and the Government added another 80
graduate engineers to the country. More than twenty (20) other engineers acquired Msc degrees
under the same project while more than seventy five (75) civil engineering technicians were
specifically trained in highway construction and maintenance. A significant improvement was
therefore realized with respect to institutional development which enabled the Ministry to fill the
vacant positions identified in previous reports4.
11.   The assistance to the Local Contracting Industry enabled the borrower to improve the
local construction industry. The objectives of this component was twofold (i) to improve the road
maintenance works executing system by introducing 'contracting' rather than 'force acount'and
this can only be done by increasing the capabilities of the local contracting industry; (ii) to
provide assistance to expand the capacity and efficiency of the trucking industry hence facilitate
smoother movement of goods and freight. At the beginning of the project there were no (both
indigenous and semi indigenous) local contactors interested and capable of undertaking
Roadwork. Now there are about 300 local contractor (again here local indigenous and semi
indigenous) who have already acquired training in project management, budgeting and bid
preparation. This is quite an achievement in local construction industry. Some of these
contractors are now undertaking big jobs under IRP.
12.   The Assistance to Trucking Industry was a continuation of a previous assistance under
Credit 743-TA which had one major goal that is to support the Government's efforts to reverse
the deteriorating trend in truck transport, and this was to be achieved by (i) strengthening the
operations capability of selected companies in regions where agricultural activity was severely
constrained by inadequate truck transport services; (ii) procurement and rehabilitation of truck
through strengthening of management and management information systems; and (iii) putting
these trucking companies on a sound financial footing. The assistance constituted the provision
of spare parts; tyres and workshop tools for the Regional Trucking Companies (RETCO's) and
other firms to improve movements of goods and freight in the country. Provision of technical
assistance to the project implementation agency had an added value its success. The benefits
accrued out of this assistance and the effects are very obvious and conspicuous.
13.   The equipment rehabilitation however was not a success as envisaged under the project.
Number of reasons could be advanced as to why. however the main reason can be due to little
understanding of the real problem. There has been allot of schools of thought of this issue and
quite a few studies have been undertaken but the problem remain unresolved. Under this project
the problem was thought to be of management nature and hence an expert in the form of
technical assistance was provided to advise on equipment management. But also there has been
an issue of monitoring their availability and utilization.
14.   Furthermore to ensure that adequate service and repair is undertaken on time as well as

proper record keeping was itself a problem. In trying to solve the above issues the project has
not succeeded at all. At most the Government has now decided to divest the equipment and hope
that the Regional Engineers will still be able to get from the open market their needs for
equipment when they arise.
Borrower's performance
15.   The Borrower's performance under the project has been quite casual. On one side there
has been too many institutional restructuring within very short period such that performance of
the Borrower is seen as insignificant when measured at sectoral level. The need for private
sector participation in improving the economy of the country cannot be overemphasized.
However, it is the speed at which the borrower would like to have realized these changes at
policy level. Under this project the Borrower became more aware of developing a decentralized
contract management system for road maintenance works, and at regional level for both routine
and periodic.
16.   The policy objectives as contained in the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) prepared
in June 1982 were more real. For example in persuing the Road Transport Policy Paper with
an aim to ensuring that rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing assets were given priority
in the Transport Sector Investment Program the Borrower in December 1987 called a Transport
Sector Donor's Conference to present the paper together with another document entitled
Programme for Transport Sector Recovery.' In that document the Government outlined the
dasic policy, institutional changes and rehabilitation requirements for the sector inorder to
reestablish the road transport infrastructure to enable it to cater for the reuirements of the
economy. Furthermore the document singled out capacity building for sustainability with respect
to delivery of the transport services as a critical issue to be dealt with. First steps to restore the
country's essential road network by providing adequate funding and develop institutional capacity
for their maintenance were taken during the implementation of this project.
17.   Another major institutional reform which became an important performance indicator for
the Borrower is the agreement by the Borrower to implement the recommendations of the study
undertaken under the project. This study namely "The Agricultural Feeder Roads Study" and
funded by DANIDA became the pivot for the institutional changes for better performance. The
Terms of Reference6 for the study were carefully written, and the recommendations of the study
formed the basis for the 10 year rehabilitation programme with objectives to make administration
and management of the road network autonomous. The achievements reported under the
Integrated Roads Project7 are a result of the implementation of the study.
18.   Equally the Borrower undertook the adoption of the Market Liberation Strategy during

6 Staff Appraisal Report No. 5922-TA of April2, 1986 Annex 111-10 Pg. 72

the implementation of the project by promoting the encouragement of the local contractors in
participating in the rehabilitation and maintenance of the road infrastructure as well as the
establishment of the private plant pools and creation of a company to manage the then
Government owned equipment and plant.
19.   Overall, the Borrower learned a number of lessons relevant for the future during the
implementation of the project. The most important lesson is the one on inadequate preparations
on proper documentation that it causes a lot of delay in starting hence cost overruns. Donor
coordination is a success on this respect hence the sound and efficient system of exchange and
flow of project informations, between the implementors, as well as donors. Maintenance culture
and the importance of maintaining the existing infrastructure as a means of achieving a
sustainable economy was also a major lesson learned.
Bank's Performance
20.   During the implementation the Bank staff and management as a whole were very
cooperative. The project was supervised by five task managers during its lifetime. Organizational
changes in the Bank lead to the project passing through supervision of three Division chiefs and
hence three departments. All these changes did not affect the performance of the Bank on the
project. Unavoidable changes of the scope of work due to delays at the beginning were readily
attended to the most spectacular performance was the readiness of the Bank Staff is the early
years of implementation, to positively agree to improvements on the scope of the project. This
created a Donor-Borrower relationship that should be adopted in future for implementation. On
that basis other donor were involved in implementation (This was the first mult-Donor financed)
of the project. Donor coordination and involvement was initiated under this project and has been
very successful.
Accomplishments of the project
21.   The Civil works for paved roads envisaged under this project was overspent by SDR 3.55
mio. whilethe Gravel roads were underspent by about SDR 5.44 mio. There was an
overexpenditure of SDR 3.58 mio. for Consultancy services for the whole project life. As for
the Technical Assistance to MWCT the cost overun was SDR 2.45 mio. which is a clear
indication that there was a good number of Technical Assistance under project.
A summary of the expenditure for the IDA funds is attached for reference. Training and capacity
building for both the Local Construction Industry and the Staff in MWCT was significant. About
80 undergraduate Engineers were added to the country over and above those graduating in the
country and other sources within the project life. Local Contractors were trained and the
completion of the project the number of contractors capable of undertaking roadworks had risen
from almost ZERO to above one hundred. A good number of Postgraduate studies were persued
by MWCT staff adding about 20 proffesional to the society. There were a number of



8
amendments to the scope of the physical works of the project during the implementation. Some
of these amendments were due to delays in the startup of the project. The Civil works for the
paved road sections were delayed for more than a year while the gravel raods were moved to
the next project. All in all the project although extende twice was very successful.
