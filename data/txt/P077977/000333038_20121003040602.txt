1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. At the time of appraisal of the Rural Roads Project (RRP) in the year 2004, the
       rural population in many states in India was suffering from poor physical access
       due to lack of all-weather roads. This was constraining economic activities in
       rural areas and preventing the rural population from being fully integrated into the
       economy and accessing essential services. At that time, an estimated 300,000
       habitations (about 40% of the 825,000 habitations in India) were without all-
       weather road access. The low levels of access of habitations to all weather roads
       was partly a result of lack of adequate maintenance on the existing large rural
       road network of approximately 2.7 million km and partly a lack of capital
       investment.

1.1.2. Progress in decentralization of rural road management had also been slow. While
       constitutionally, the management of rural roads had been entrusted to the
       Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) 1 , almost all state governments retained
       ownership of the majority or all of the low volume roads in their states, leading to
       diffused accountability for the condition of the rural road network. Also, the rural
       road sector was suffering from relatively low levels of technical and planning
       capacity in many areas. This lack of technical and planning capacity was
       impacting the ability of road agencies to absorb new investment funds and was
       also affecting proper asset maintenance. In addition, multiple-ownership issues
       were also impacting road sector management.

1.1.3. In order to address the problem of poor rural accessibility and improve planning
       and management of rural roads, the Prime Minister’s Rural Road Program
       (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, PMGSY) was announced in late 20002 .
       This was a watershed program as it involved a recentralization of a fairly
       decentralized subject by taking up works through a mission mode steered by a
       national level Apex Body. At the time of project appraisal, the PMGSY had
       already made progress, having completed or close to completed works on 22,100
       habitations with population 1,000 and above and financed works for connecting
       another 24,300 habitations with population of less than 1,000. This is against the
       PMGSY targets of providing new connectivity to about 178,000 habitations

  The Panchayati Raj is a South Asian political system mainly in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. It is actually
the oldest system of local government in the Indian subcontinent. The word "Panchayat" literally means
"assembly" (ayat) of five (panch) wise and respected elders chosen and accepted by the local community.
Gram Panchayats are local self-governments at the village or small town level in India. The Gram
Panchayat is the foundation of the Panchayat System. Gram Sabha means a body consisting of persons
whose names are for the time being entered as electors in the electoral roll for a Panchayat.

  The program sought to achieve all weather access for every habitation with a population greater than
1,000 by the end of 2003, and for habitations greater than 500 people (250 people in hill states and desert
areas) by the end of 2007.


                                                      1
       involving construction of about 375,000 km of roads apart from upgrading of
       372,000 km of existing rural roads (in poor condition). Challenges being faced by
       the program at that stage included shortfall in the availability of funds, capacity
       constraints of road agencies and contractors and the issue of inadequate
       maintenance on rural roads.

1.1.4. Project rationale: The provision of connectivity to the rural population was the
       primary focus of the PMGSY program. Allocation of funds to different states
       under the program was mainly governed by the investment needs to achieve
       program targets with some linkages with performance indicators under the
       program. However, no mechanism of linking PMGSY funds with maintenance of
       the entire core network existed. RRP sought to introduce the notion of partly
       linking PMGSY grants to sound management on the entire core rural road
       network. Further, by demonstrating the value of sector planning and management
       reforms in pilot states or districts in partnership with the GOI, the likelihood that
       similar reforms would be implemented as a result of GOI’s own funding through
       PMGSY was greatly enhanced. GO1 had set itself very ambitious connectivity
       targets that required substantial additional resources if they were to be met on
       time, and the Bank, both through IDA and as needed through IBRD, had the
       financial capacity to contribute to the public investment in this huge public good.

1.1.5. This project was envisaged to provide funds, additional to existing Government of
       India transfers, to four of the most poorly connected states - Himachal Pradesh,
       Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The project aimed at accelerating rural
       growth. It sought to contribute to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
       objective for poverty reduction in India through two channels: first, by enhancing
       mobility and thus providing more opportunities for employment, trade, and
       growth within the rural economy; and second, by providing better physical access
       to basic services thereby increasing the quality of life of the poor in the project
       influenced areas. This project was proposed as the first in a series of credits/loans
       to support the Government of India's program of total rural connectivity over the
       subsequent five to seven years. The second project in this series, “PMGSY Rural
       Roads Project?, has been already approved by the Bank in December 2010 and is
       under implementation.

1.2.   Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
       approved)

1.2.1. The project development objective was to achieve broader and more sustainable
       access to markets and social services by the rural population in participating
       districts. This objective was to be measured through the following indicators: (i)
       percentage of eligible habitations in project areas with all-weather access to social
       services and markets; (ii) percentage of through routes in the core rural road
       network in participating districts in fair or better condition; and (iii) level of
       stakeholder satisfaction with rural road network in participating districts.




                                             2
1.3.    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
        Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.3.1. The original PDO was not revised. Also, the indicators to measure performance
       were not revised.

1.4.    Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1. The main beneficiaries of the project included the people in the habitations which
       were to be connected to all weather roads. Anticipated project benefits included
       all season access to economic opportunities and social services, employment
       generation for new construction and maintenance, and improved access to
       transport services. Participating states as a whole also benefited indirectly from
       improvements in the economy as a result of the project.

1.4.2. The staff of the implementing agencies in participating states and at NRRDA also
       benefited because of capacity development, which in turn, benefited the entire
       PMGSY program. Also, the contracting community benefited from the training
       and capacity building activities under the project.

1.5.    Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1. A summary of the main components of the project, together with their costs, is
       listed below:

    a) New Connection and Upgrading of Core Rural Road Networks(USD 430.91
       million):

       i. Civil Works (USD 422.66 million): This includes new construction and
          upgrading of the core rural road network in four states to provide all-weather
          road access to habitations in identified project districts comprising up to 60%
          of all districts in the states, or 78 in all. The component is proposed to be
          implemented in four tranches over five years using NCB procedures generally
          in packages of Rs.1-5 Cr. in line with existing PMGSY practice. Tranche I
          will commence from effectiveness and subsequent tranches annually thereafter
          in line with current PMGSY practice. However, there may be some overlap in
          implementation of each tranche depending upon the capacity of the state
          agency and the local construction industry concerned.

       ii. Technical Examination Services (USD 7.26 million): Consultants will be
           commissioned by each state to undertake independent technical examination of
           Bank funded works. The specific objectives of the services are - for Bank
           funded rural road sub projects in the State - to verify: (i) proper application of
           environmental, social and techno-economic screening procedures for the
           selection of rural road sub-projects; (ii) detailed design is in compliance with
           agreed technical standards as well as stipulated environmental and social



                                              3
         management measures; (iii) the quality of bidding documents is satisfactory
         and that procurement is undertaken in conformity with agreed procedures; (iv)
         compliance of actual works with contract conditions and quality assurance
         procedures as well as agreed environmental and social management measures;
         and (v) expenditures under the Credit/Loan have been made for the purpose
         intended (financial review). One firm will be hired to oversee the first two
         tranches of works in each state and then a separate firm for the remaining two
         tranches.

     iii. Implementation of Compensatory Forestry and resettlement (USD 1.00
          million): Wherever roads require compensatory afforestation to meet the
          provisions of any Forest Department clearance, State governments will deposit
          funds to undertake this afforestation prior to the clearance becoming effective.
          Under current PMGSY policy and practice, the state implementing agency
          concerned is to deposit funds for afforestation with the local forest offices.
          Assistance to eligible project affected persons will be made through ongoing
          state public programs or through community mobilization

 b) Periodic and Routine Maintenance of Core Rural Road Network in Project
    Areas(USD 235.00 million, financed by State Governments): This component is to
    be undertaken in every district where the Bank is providing additional investment
    concurrently with the four tranches of new construction works. The works
    (US$235.00 million, NBF) would be prepared and supervised by the same
    implementing agencies undertaking PMGSY works and will be implemented
    through a mixture of force account for routine works (in HP, Rajasthan and UP)
    and contract for periodic works. The size of the component was determined after
    discussion with Participating states and is roughly equivalent to a per km cost of
    Rs.20,000/year on average and works to be conducted on all the core rural road
    network of 100,000 km in all in these 78 districts. All districts that are seeking
    Bank funding in the first tranches have prepared and made public an annual
    maintenance plan.

 c) Institutional Development (USD 13.56 million):

i.    National Level (USD 0.96 million): There are two institutional development sub
      components at the national level. First, a poverty impact and rural road user
      satisfaction monitoring system is to be put in place. This is to be achieved
      through hiring a single technical support agency to prepare the methodology and
      manage the system on behalf of the MORD (US$0.2 million). The actual data
      collection, to be undertaken three times during the project period, will be carried
      out by separate firms covering one or more states each (US$ 0.56 million).
      Second, technical assistance and training is to be made available to the MORD
      and the National Quality Monitors to build capacity in various areas (US$0.20
      million).




                                           4
 ii.   State level (USD 12.60 million): There are three sub-components to the state level
       institutional development inputs. First, technical assistance consultants are to be
       commissioned by each state (US$4.24 million) with a view to: (i) develop and
       establish in use a simple Road Management System (RMS) in HQ and in district
       field offices; (ii) prepare annual maintenance programs and support the
       implementation by the road agency of these programs, including through the use
       of performance based contracting, on the core road network; (iii) recommend and
       help implement on a pilot basis a framework for transferring ownership of non
       core rural roads to PRIs; and (iv) transfer skills and procedures to an adequate
       number of staff in the road agency to sustain the use of the RMS and continuing
       implementation of maintenance. Second, various goods are to be procured by
       each State - material and quality control testing equipment, IT and associated
       office equipment - for use by the implementing agencies (US$4.72 million).
       Third, each state will undertake training needs analysis and implement training of
       their staff within the main rural road agency plus the local contracting industry
       (US$3.54 million).

1.6.   Revised Components

1.6.1. There were no major revisions to the project components.

1.7.   Other significant changes: Three times restructuring was done as detailed
       below

 1.7.1 Re-allocation of funds within categories: Undisbursed funds from the Works
       category were re-allocated to other categories in February 2011. This reallocation
       was required to support consultancies, trainings and other activities under the
       institutional development component. The reallocation was based on the proposal
       received from the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) dated July 2, 2010
       routed through DEA on September 28, 2010.

1.7.2. Extension of closing date: The closing date of the project was extended in March
       2010 by 24 months, i.e. from March 31, 2010 to March 31, 2012 in March 2010
       to complete the remaining activities which include (i) consolidate the institutional
       development initiatives, (ii) complete the ongoing and additional rural roads
       works to be taken up from the recently reallocated funds to UP ($27) and
       Rajasthan ($9), and (iii) undertake further capacity building activities planned for
       rural roads agencies.

1.7.3. Allocation of additional funds to Rajasthan and UP: The Credit agreement
       schedule-1 was modified in September 2009 to provide additional funds to
       Rajasthan and UP from Jharkhand and other available savings.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry



                                            5
2.1.1. The project rationale of partly linking PMGSY grants to management of the entire
       core rural road network, demonstrating the value of sector reforms in pilot regions,
       as well as contributing financially to the public investment in this huge public
       good was sound and well detailed in the project appraisal document. The logical
       linkage between project issues of: (i) low levels of connectivity of the villages;
       (ii) poorly planned investments; (iii) inadequate maintenance and road asset
       management; and (iv) low capacity in many rural road agencies, and the project
       components was also strong. The focus on institutional development and capacity
       building of participating rural road agencies, local contractors as well as MORD
       was a desirable value-addition that this project envisaged and offered to the
       existing PMGSY program. The project design was based on the robust
       Comprehensive New-Connectivity Priority List (CNCPL) framework and also
       extensive public participation instruments. However, the M&E framework was
       not designed to effectively capture the outcomes of the institutional development
       component. Also, most of the indicators were designed for the outcome of the
       program in the participating states and did not necessarily capture the impact of
       the project.

2.1.2. Lessons learnt and reflected in the project design: Some of the lessons that were
       recognized and substantially incorporated at the stage of design of the project
       were: (i) the requirement of state government commitment to adequately fund and
       undertake rural road maintenance; (ii) focused investments over a manageable
       area rather than thinly spread investments over a larger area; (iii) independent
       monitoring of quality of road designs and construction; (iv) a reliable and
       comprehensive database for investment decisions and promoting improved
       management of rural roads; and (v) capacity building and training of
       implementing agency staff in all aspects of rural road management. However, the
       scope for reducing construction costs through adopting optimal design standards
       and promoting the use of local materials especially for low trafficked rural roads
       was not fully captured as part of project design.

2.1.3. Risks and Mitigation measures: A largely comprehensive risk assessment was
       done and is available in the PAD. However, the extent of risk varied from state to
       state. In the case of two risks, namely: (i) rural road staff design road works
       poorly; and (ii) delayed or improper procurement by rural road agencies, the risks
       were seemingly underestimated. In the case of Jharkhand, the planned
       construction of roads was substantially reduced because of these delays. Another
       risk which was not identified during preparation was the reluctance of states to
       use Bank funds when funds could also be accessed through the normal PMGSY
       programme which had fewer requirements in terms of safeguard and fiduciary
       compliance. Several states were not able to meet the additional requirements of
       the project. Limited capacity of the implementing agency and NRRDA was also a
       risk that was not suitably identified and mitigated. However, the TA sub-project




                                            6
          on Economic Reform 3 provided additional capacity building support which
          helped mitigate this risk to some extent. The risk of sustainability of the project
          was not directly identified.

2.1.4. Overall, the differences between the participating states in terms of: (a)
       infrastructure needs, and (b) capacity to implement such a project, was a major
       feature in the design of the project and its components and implementation was
       also a challenge due to this very factor.

2.1.5. Quality at Entry: No quality at entry assessment of the project was carried out.

2.2.      Implementation

2.2.1. While the project got off to a smooth start in end-2004, issues relating to funding
       of maintenance for the core network, limited concurrent institutional development
       and supply side constraints for new construction started emerging to different
       degrees in different states, and led to a downgrading of the PDO rating to “MS?
       and of the Implementation Progress rating to “MU? in mid-2007. At this time,
       some of the critical issues that the project faced included slow procurement in
       Jharkhand, lack of staff at headquarters as well as field levels in UP, delays in
       implementation of Tranche I works in HP, Jharkhand and UP, procurement delays
       and weak implementation of the Environment and Social Management
       Framework (ESMF) in the state of UP. Some of these issues (e.g. progress in
       Tranche I works, implementation of ESMF) were resolved fairly swiftly, while
       some others such as delays in the procurement process in UP and delays in
       preparation of annual maintenance plans were addressed through intensive
       monitoring and capacity building support (e.g. preparation of action plans to
       address issues, decision to prepare a simple annual maintenance plan followed by
       an excel based maintenance management system, and conducting workshops to
       sensitize the contracting community). The situation in Jharkhand however
       remained a concern which was mainly because of slow procurement and lack of
       staffing.

2.2.2. The mid-term review was done in March 2007. Though the disbursement at that
       time was better than the appraisal forecast (18.8% more than the forecast), there
       was imbalance in the performance of different states. The Jharkhand was lagging
       due to lack of ownership and lack of staff. Another area of concern was
       implementation of ESMF in UP. The need of relocating funds from Jharkhand to
       other states was already identified by then though it actually happened in
       September 2009.

2.2.3. Overall implementation progress came back to a satisfactory rating in 2009 while
       the PDO rating came back to satisfactory in end 2010 owing to proactive support



3
    This was for a loan effective October 2010 for the amount USD 45 million


                                                     7
       and monitoring by the MORD and NRRDA. Some of the factors that gave rise to
       problems in the interim and how these were attempted to be overcome are briefly
       described below:

2.2.4. Different states had different levels of implementation challenges. There were
       some delays in preparation of the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) and
       consequently in awarding of contracts in Jharkhand, HP and UP. Procurement in
       Jharkhand remained slow throughout the project. Inadequate staffing for the
       SRRDA and for safeguards in particular was a challenge. Sustained efforts by
       MORD and NRRDA for provision of training for the staff and interim missions
       by the Bank team, helped in resolving many of the implementation related issues.
       Training and sensitization workshops led to improvements in the participation of
       bidders in states such as UP and Rajasthan. However, the continued unsatisfactory
       progress in Jharkhand, especially resulting from slow progress of procurement,
       ultimately led to a substantial reduction of the Jharkhand component in the project,
       and funds that were originally allocated for use in Jharkhand were re-allocated to
       Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.

2.2.5. By the closure of the project, works for new construction had been mostly
       completed. Against the target of 9,900km of the new road construction, a total of
       9625 km (97% of the target) had been completed. The core road network
       maintenance component was implemented with counterpart funds and the
       corresponding indicators have been mostly achieved. However, despite
       interventions supported by the Bank such as development of a pavement design
       manual, independent reviews of engineering designs through technical examiners,
       and preparation of a rural roads manual by MORD with separate technical
       specifications for rural roads, most of the implementation remained as per
       conventional designs in all the states, and the use of cost effective optimal designs
       using locally available material was inadequate. Similarly, adequate emphasis on
       optimization of geometric design and road alignment was not there.

2.2.6. There were initial delays in the institutional strengthening and maintenance
       components. Despite these initial delays, by project closing, all activities under
       this component were completed. The main areas of training (imparted in local as
       well as international institutions) included maintenance management, quality
       control, environment management and e-procurement. Indeed, the project’s
       training and capacity building activities have had a very significant impact and
       actually covered much beyond the project, spreading to the mainstream. Except
       for Jharkhand, all other states have also developed simple maintenance
       management systems (MMS) to prepare annual maintenance plans and HP has
       even started allocating maintenance funds based on the MMS. Utilization of the
       On-line Monitoring Management and Accounting Systems (OMMAS) was
       another major step forward, though OMMAS was not developed as part of this
       project. The participating states are now in the process of procuring consultancy
       services to further initiatives on asset management, maintenance contracts, quality
       assurance and other aspects. Some of the institutional development initiatives



                                             8
       started under this project would continue through the Bank support available
       under the PMGSY Rural Roads Project.

2.2.7. Overall, despite the uneven implementation of the project because of the differing
       capacity and unwillingness of state governments to implement the agreed
       measures and wide variation in the implementation capacities, proactive
       engagement by MORD, NRRDA and the Bank helped resolve most of the issues.
       By the closure of the project, all the components were completed satisfactorily
       which is confirmed by the last seven ratings in the ISRs.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation, Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. Broadly, the project indicators captured the impact of the PMGSY program in the
       project states and were not necessarily linked to the exclusive impact of the
       project as such. The targets set by the program have not only been achieved but
       exceeded in most cases, which broadly shows that the targets set for these
       indicators were moderate and that the PMGSY program has progressed well.
       Given that the PDO referred to the performance of selected districts, the
       performance indicators should ideally have been designed to measure
       performance in selected districts rather than the program as a whole in
       participating states. However since this project was envisaged to provide funds to
       60% of the districts in participating states, the use of PMGSY indicators to
       measure progress should not be seen as too wide off the mark.

2.3.2. Another shortcoming of the M&E framework was that the indicators did not
       capture all the expected outcomes of the Institutional Development component,
       for which only one indicator i.e. percentage of rural road works prioritized using
       maintenance management system, was designed. The other anticipated outputs
       from this exercise, for instance initiatives on quality assurance and capacity
       building, transfer of ownership of noncore rural roads to PRIs on pilot basis were
       also not captured.

2.3.3. The maintenance management system in UP and Rajasthan is in need of updating
       the data, which raises questions about the extent to which the system is actually
       being used on a regular basis in these states, and about its sustainability beyond
       project closure. However, it is worth mentioning that the project promoted the use
       of the OMMAS, which NRRDA now recommends as mandatory for all progress
       reports and monitoring in order to access future PMGSY funds. Under the
       PMGSY Rural Roads Project, further refinements in OMMAS are being planned
       so as to use it as an effective management tool for PMGSY by producing
       customized management and performance reports at state and national levels.

2.4.   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary compliance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory




                                           9
2.4.1. Procurement. Procurement is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Most of the
       procurement in this project consisted of procurement of works through NCB for
       new construction and upgrading of core rural road network in addition to the
       procurement of Technical Advisory Services and implementation of social and
       environmental measures. All goods, works and services were generally procured
       in accordance with the provisions contained in Bank Guidelines except some
       procedural errors noticed in procurement of works. The procurement capacity
       varied considerably between the states from satisfactory to unsatisfactory. While
       Rajasthan broadly demonstrated adequate procurement capacity, better ownership
       and strong monitoring, the other states were lagging on these aspects. This
       resulted in delays in award of contracts, frequent rebidding and procedural errors
       in finalizing the contracts. Delays in preparation and approvals of DPRs also
       contributed to delays in awarding of contracts in HP, Jharkhand and UP.
       Procurement remained slow in Jharkhand throughout the project and no
       procurement was done during the last two years of the project. The project faced a
       number of challenges including a rapidly increasing size of the program but a
       limited capacity of the construction industry in the states, outdated cost estimates
       which lacked flexibility to respond to fluctuating market rates, distortions to the
       bidding process caused by effective bid ceilings with respect to engineers’
       estimates, high levels of rebidding and delays in award of contracts.

2.4.2. The factors responsible for inadequate competition in bidding were limited
       availability of qualified contractors, outdated cost estimates and reluctance of the
       states to award contracts above the estimated price even if the price obtained
       against the tender was competitive and reasonable compared to market rates. This
       was because the GOI funding was limited to the estimated price and the cost
       above the estimated cost was required to be funded by the states from their
       resources, for which the states were reluctant. Different qualification criteria and
       procurement procedures for this project compared to those used in the PMGSY
       program also created problems in states such as Jharkhand and UP where as a
       result, the level of competition was very low and many of the works had to be
       subjected to repeated re-invitation of bids.

2.4.3. An IPR carried out by the Bank suggested mitigation measures for weak contract
       management – namely, independent procurement, financial management, and
       contract management reviews; regular inspections by the senior officers of the
       road agency and SRRDAs; and improving the quality of engineering designs,
       field investigations, safeguard aspects to avoid subsequent delays during
       execution.

2.4.4. Overall, all goods, works and services were generally procured in accordance
       with the provisions contained in Bank Guidelines. While the project did face
       some challenges and delays in implementation, the lessons learned from this
       project were effectively incorporated in the design of the PMGSY Rural Roads
       Project. Overall, procurement is rated as Moderately Satisfactory on this project.




                                            10
2.4.5. Financial Management. Financial management performance for the project is
       rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The PMGSY financial management systems
       were under development at the time the project was being prepared and this
       provided the Bank with the opportunity to contribute and provide inputs into the
       design of the systems. In its design, the system combines the features of
       traditional works department accounting practices with a double entry accounting
       system to prepare monthly and annual financial statements and has been
       considered as a best practice model for Central Plan Programs. The system is
       documented in three separate Accounts Manuals – Program Fund, Administrative
       Fund and Maintenance Fund. The customized financial management system as
       designed for PMGSY allows manual accounting as well as the web-based online
       computerized Receipts and Payments (R&P) module of the OMMAS. The public
       citizen interface facility of OMMAS 4 allows access to updated compiled state
       wise financial reports.

2.4.6. The financial management arrangements for the project were fully embedded
       within PMGSY’s systems. For a variety of reasons, including the lack of reliable
       web connections in some districts and limited staff capacity, implementation of
       the computerized R&P module of the OMMAS was slower than the MORD had
       anticipated.

2.4.7. Disbursements which started with the SOE method were shifted to report based
       method as the timeliness and quality of the financial reports generated from the
       Receipts & Payments module of OMMAS improved. Weaknesses with respect to
       delays in bank reconciliations, inadequate controls over fund authorization, stale
       bank guarantees, non-settlement of advances etc. have been noted by successive
       Bank missions as well as internal and external audit reports. While the states
       continued to take several remedial measures to address the weaknesses, the results
       have been varying across the states. For the PMGSY Rural Roads Project, revised
       guidelines for selection of Chartered Accountant (CA) firms for external audit
       have been prepared; the selection of auditors will follow the quality and cost
       based method.

2.4.8. NRRDA has an important role in supervising the day-to-day operation of the
       PMGSY financial management system and for establishment of satisfactory
       financial management arrangements, providing timely financial reports to
       stakeholders including the World Bank and providing overall guidance in respect
       of the financial management issues for the project. The current staffing structure
       at NRRDA, however, only allows a fairly limited level of oversight and
       supervision. NRRDA’s oversight on the financial management arrangements at
       the state level is presently limited to review of the annual audit reports,
       troubleshooting on OMMAS and providing training on an “as required? basis.

                                              11
2.4.9. On the overall, the project has had positive impact on financial management of
       PMGSY program, both in terms of the design of the systems as well as the quality
       of implementation. However the project did face some delays in implementation,
       and given the fairly limited oversight and supervision of financial management
       arrangements at state level currently, financial management is rated as
       Moderately Satisfactory on this project.

Environmental and Social Safeguard compliance overall is rated Satisfactory with
environmental safeguards being Satisfactory and social safeguards being
Satisfactory.

2.4.10. Social. Since the construction of rural roads was taken up on the existing revenue
        tracks, the extent of land needed was minimal and there were no resettlement
        issues in terms of relocating families. The Borrower had carried out a social
        assessment in all the project states through an independent consulting agency and
        formulated an Environment and Social Management Framework - Resettlement
        Policy and Framework (ESMF-RP&F) to address social and resettlement issues in
        this project. The assessment brought out minimal land requirements for road
        widening and community willingness to volunteer for land donation. The ESMF-
        RP&F adopted the voluntary land donation approach with appropriate safeguards.
        The ESMF-RP&F/social safeguard objectives were:
         The alignment of the road is finalized in consultation with the community
         To ensure that land donation is not enforced upon the community
         The vulnerable community is assisted for income restoration

2.4.11. (i) Dissemination (ii) consultation (iii) collaboration and (iv) extension of choice
        were the four major processing steps that the Framework prescribed for ensuring
        community participation, voluntary land donation and mitigation of adverse
        impacts on the vulnerable.

2.4.12. The project introduced some innovations in social aspects that led to the
        implementation of the ESMF-RP&F, which included:
         Transect walk with the community for joint decision making, on site
           inventory, identification of affected land and other immovable properties, land
           tenure and finalization of alignment. This technique was found to be useful in
           the finalization of the alignment through informed participation of the
           community and early identification of design requirements
         Involvement of PRIs in the selection process of the core network, preparation
           of DPRs and implementation resulted in higher acceptance of the project
           among the community
         Coordination with revenue officials on a day to day basis helped the
           implementing agencies in establishing land ownership
         Consultations through the Gram Sabha were held in order to select the
           roads. After the consultations, a formal request was sent by the Gram
           Panchayat to the PWD for selection of the road. Consultation resulted in
           minimizing the resistance among the community members and maximizing


                                            12
            community benefits. Involvement of the community also resulted in
            identification of several construction induced adverse impacts and its
            mitigation
           Information dissemination to sensitize the community, disclosing the sub
            project level details and finalizing the schedule for consultation and transect
            walk through Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials
            provided a foundation for collaboration between community and project
            authorities
           Targeted support to vulnerable groups viz. (a) alternate land sites provided
            by the community or Gram Panchayat and (b) inclusion as beneficiaries in
            existing poverty alleviation/livelihood restoration program

2.4.13. Implementation: Social safeguard compliance is satisfactory for the following
        reasons. The ESMF-RP&F, despite institutional constraints, has been
        implemented satisfactorily. The ESMF-RP&F essentially provided the platform
        for involvement of the local community in the selection and finalization of the
        alignment of the road and land to be made available to the executing agency.

2.4.14. The Bank closely monitored the various safeguards measures, and compliance
        ratings were frequently adjusted (ranging from S to U and back again) in response
        to observed conditions, particularly for preparing social safeguard documentation
        in DPRs and land donations. Identified issues were normally resolved quickly,
        and the Bank’s persistent surveillance on these issues facilitated substantial
        improvements. Following the identification of serious deficiencies in safeguard
        preparation in project DPRs in Uttar Pradesh in year 2006, the Bank conducted
        complete audit of social safeguards preparation and implementation for all project
        roads and developed a time bound action plan for retrospective corrective
        measures 5 . Post MTR, these measures resulted in substantial improvement in
        safeguard compliance in UP. A series of training programmes were conducted at
        the Divisional level for field officers through Third Party consultants. The
        Government of UP also prepared a documentary video on social safeguards for
        wide dissemination and capacity building on social safeguards.

2.4.15. Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh performed well on social safeguards
        implementation. The Government of Rajasthan is bringing out a Good Practices
        Manual on ESMF-RP&F based on its implementation experience. In community
        interactions people expressed their satisfaction with road works and also stated
        that access to social and other physical infrastructure (schools, etc) had improved.

2.4.16. Overall, considering above facts, the social compliance is rated as Satisfactory.

 This risk is mitigated in the PMGSY Rural Roads Project by strengthening capacity of state agencies to
implement SMF/VF and ESMF/ECoPs provisions, verifying through supervision consultants/PIUs
implementation of agreed SMF/VF and ESMF/ECoPs provisions before clearing Interim Payment
Certificates (IPCs) and completion certificates, enhancing the use of the complaint handling module of
OMMAS and developing a grievance redressal system to track monitoring of complaints


                                                  13
2.4.17. Environment. The Borrower had carried out an environment assessment in the
        four project states and formulated an Environment and Social Management
        Framework (ESMF) to address environmental issues in this project. The
        assessment identified issues such as impacts on topography, material sources,
        drainage, flora and fauna, community resources, waste disposal and soil
        conservation, which had to be addressed adequately during various stages of the
        project cycle to avoid, minimize and mitigate unwarranted impacts on natural and
        physical environment. Following this assessment, which included review of
        current practices through site visits and discussions with officials of the
        implementing agencies, a stand-alone document called Environmental Codes of
        Practice (ECoPs) was prepared. A total of 20 codes covering aspects such as sub-
        project selection and planning, construction camp management, borrow areas,
        top-soil conservation, debris management, public consultation, drainage and
        worker safety aspects, were prepared to assist implementing agencies in dealing
        with environmental issues likely to be encountered during project execution. This
        approach helped minimize the need for sub-project level EAs and Environmental
        Management Plans (EMPs) by mainstreaming environmental issues in the
        selection, planning, design and construction stages of the project.

2.4.18. Implementation: While, in the initial stages of project implementation, the
        awareness, understanding and capacity to deal with environmental issues in the
        context of the rural roads sector was fairly limited, the project with Bank’s
        support has been able to gradually sensitize and build the understanding of the
        key players in appreciating environmental issues, based on which project
        preparation improved and various measures were executed in the field to mitigate
        and better manage such concerns.

2.4.19. Since the construction of rural roads was largely taken-up on the existing revenue
        tracks, the extent of impact on environmental features such as fertile farmland,
        orchards, trees, sacred groves, water bodies and religious structures was minimal.
        Practices like transect walk and community consultation helped in addressing
        issues early on in the project cycle. The project also helped in introducing good
        practices for addressing two critical issues, namely slope protection and disposal
        of debris, which otherwise are responsible for creating a series of direct and
        indirect environmental and social impacts, particularly in hilly terrain. Notable
        efforts were made by HPSRRDA (Himachal Pradesh State Rural Road
        Development Agency) to prevent damage to properties and water sources through
        protection works, proper management of spoils/debris, and provision of adequate
        drainage works. Similarly, in Rajasthan, good practices, including those
        pertaining to road safety pre-cautions in settlement areas, community involvement
        and provision of measures in areas of wildlife presence (outside protected areas)
        have been introduced. A report covering good practices and lessons learnt during
        ESMF application and implementation in the said state has also been prepared.




                                           14
2.4.20. In almost all the participating states, some roads, especially in the initial phases,
        were delayed due to lack of forest clearances. In subsequent phases, with
        insistence of having a prior forestry clearance in hand before the bids are
        invited/awarded, such situations were almost completely avoided. In fact, this
        approach has helped in avoiding legal issues/court cases; reducing time and cost
        overruns in the sub-projects; and has helped states such as Himachal Pradesh in
        adopting the required forward planning and processing of regulatory requirements
        in a timely manner across both Bank and non-Bank funded projects. .

2.4.21. The Bank task team closely monitored the various environmental measures, and
        compliance ratings were frequently adjusted in response to observed conditions.
        Identified issues were usually resolved quickly, and the persistent implementation
        support from NRRDA and the Bank, including frequent interactions with
        communities and support to training programmes for SRRDA staff, PIUs and
        Contractors on identified issues facilitated in bring about the required
        improvements in project preparation and implementation. As brought out in para
        2.4.15, following the identification of serious deficiencies in ESMF application in
        project DPRs in Uttar Pradesh in 2006, the Bank conducted intensive review/audit
        and developed a time bound action plan for retrospective corrective measures. A
        series of training programmes were conducted at the PIU level which helped in
        improving the quality of preparation of DPRs in the state.

2.4.22. On the whole, given the participating states’ efforts at applying and implementing
        the ESMF/ECoPs, environmental compliance is rated as Satisfactory on this
        project.

2.5.   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. As mentioned earlier, as a major step forward, MORD has made it mandatory for
       the states to complete all data-entry in OMMAS and submit all progress reports
       through OMMAS in order to access future PMGSY funds. This has significantly
       improved the database of the OMMAS. Under the PMGSY Rural Roads Project,
       further refinements in OMMAS are being planned to use it as an effective
       management tool for PMGSY by producing customized management and
       performance reports at state and national levels.

2.5.2. All states that were part of this project are also participating in the recently started
       PMGSY Rural Roads Project. The systems already instituted as well as
       institutional development initiatives that commenced as part of the project are
       accordingly being carried forward by the PMGSY Rural Roads Project. This new
       project has a technical assistance component to help states undertake
       enhancements in PMGSY systems and address critical sector issues such as poor
       capacity, slow procurement, lack of design innovation, lack of road maintenance,
       and continued focus on capacity building of implementing agencies.




                                              15
2.5.3. Further, the state of Rajasthan has requested for Bank support for a rural roads
       project to provide road connectivity to smaller habitations not covered under
       PMGSY and also for road sector modernization, and this project is at the concept
       stage. For the PMGSY Rural Roads and Rajasthan Road Modernization Projects,
       it is recommended that all implementing agencies and also contractors be
       provided additional and regular training in aspects such as project preparation,
       road and bridge design, procurement, contract administration, quality control and
       safeguard management starting at an early stage.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.    Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. The development priorities as reflected in the PDO, which was “to achieve
       broader and more sustainable access to markets and social services by the rural
       population in participating districts? remained relevant throughout the life of the
       project and are as relevant now as they were at the time of project appraisal. The
       project was in line with the CAS for 2002-2005 and 2005-2008 as it aimed to
       strengthen the enabling environment for development and poverty reduction by
       accelerating rural growth. The project was also very much in line with the
       priorities of the GoI and supported the flagship PMGSY program. The importance
       and relevance of the objective is also reflected in the World Bank funded PMGSY
       Rural Roads project which aims to carry forward the achievements of the current
       project by further improving access to markets and social services for the
       unconnected habitations.

3.1.2. The project design comprising components for new construction and
       improvement of rural roads, maintenance of the core road network and
       institutional development rightly placed emphasis not only on the construction of
       new roads but also maintenance of existing roads as well as capacity development
       activities which would facilitate implementation of the larger PMGSY program,
       and was thus consistent with the overall project objectives of improving access to
       markets and social services for the rural population. The fact that construction of
       road component for one state (Jharkhand6) had to be reduced was not so much a
       result of a change in the relevance of the objectives and design of the project but
       rather a circumstance that showed that when a program runs in different states
       with differing implementation capacities, a degree of flexibility is required to
       tailor the technical assistance program to the specific needs of each state, which is
       in fact an important lesson learned from this project. Further there should also be
       flexibility in designing the overall project administration structure and
       implementation arrangements and safeguards compliance mechanisms without
       deviating from the basic framework. Though the project had an institutional
       development component, the PDO did not directly emphasize enabling

  Jharkhand has the problem of Left Wing Extremism, in addition to other implementation issues such as
slow procurement


                                                 16
          improvements in the PMGSY systems and institutional development. Also there
          were limited indicators for the institutional development component.

3.1.3. Considering that the project objectives and components remained relevant during
       the entire implementation period and are relevant even today, and also the fact
       that the PMGSY is considered a well performing program and the project
       objective and design helped in overall program implementation, the overall rating
       for relevance of objective, design and implementation is Satisfactory.

3.2.      Achievement of Project Development Objectives:

3.2.1. Achievement of the PDO was measured through the key outcome indicators of the
       project, which included: (i) percentage of eligible habitations with all-weather
       access to social services and markets; (ii) percentage of through routes in the core
       rural road network in participating districts in fair or better condition; and (iii)
       level of road user satisfaction with the rural road network in participating districts.

3.2.2. Overall about 83 percent of eligible habitations had been connected compared to a
       target of 60 percent. About 50 percent through routes were in good condition
       compared to a target of 43 percent. The level of road user satisfaction with
       PMGSY roads was found high in all the participating states as per the impact
       surveys undertaken in participating states at regular intervals. The PMGSY roads
       were found to be having a significant impact on agriculture, employment, land
       prices, girls’ education, and access to health facilities in medical emergencies.
       The participating states had also started to allocate maintenance funds for the
       PMGSY rural roads as per the instructions of the MORD in the later years of the
       project. This had made a significant impact on the level of road maintenance of
       the PMGSY roads which has also been noticed under the road user satisfaction
       surveys7.

3.2.3. As mentioned, there is a contradiction between the PDO and the actual value of
       the indicators, especially in terms of the area for which these indicators was to be
       measured. While the PDO talks about achievements over project districts, the
       indicators have been used for the entire state. In this way, the indicators have
       captured the impact of the entire PMGSY program in these states and not
       necessarily that of the project alone. However, the fact that the project covered
       60% of the districts in participating states and the indicators have been mostly
       over-achieved, suggests a satisfactory level of achievement of PDO. Also, some
       of the indicators are not achieved. For example, Jharkhand could not achieve
       indicator 2.1, for indicator 3.2, end data is not available for two states, indicator
       1.1 could be evaluated at macro level only as state wise detailed reallocation of

         roads to be constructed was not available after restructuring done in 2009 and
         indicator 3.3 is fully achieved by only one state. However, many other indicators
         are overachieved

3.2.4. On the basis of all the above, it may be concluded that the project’s achievement
       of its development objectives was Satisfactory at an overall level as there were
       minor shortcomings. This rating is also consistent with the rating in the last four
       ISRs

3.3.     Efficiency

3.3.1. Efficiency in achieving the PDO in terms of EIRR is Moderately Satisfactory.
       The economic analysis for the project roads indicates a relatively wide spread in
       the economic results among the states as shown in Table 1 below. The table also
       presents the results of economic analysis which were carried out at the time of
       appraisal, for comparison purposes.

      Total            9,624.9       19%        15%         1.56           33%     19%        1.53
   * Modified EIRR assumes 12% cost of capital and reinvestment rate

3.3.2. The EIRR obtained ranges from 10% for Himachal Pradesh to 26% for Uttar
       Pradesh and the combined EIRR for all four states was 19% (Modified EIRR –
       15%). Overall, the EIRRs are below the estimates at appraisal. This may be
       mainly because of increased construction cost and time over run. The economic
       analysis done at appraisal as well as at the time of ICR preparation does not
       include the counterpart financed road maintenance component where progress has
       been better than planned. Detailed economic analysis for all the states is presented
       in Annex 3.

3.3.3. Other indicators of efficiency: The project was extended by two years. Perhaps if
       more proactive and close monitoring by MORD and NRRDA of lagging states
       (such as Jharkhand) had taken place at an early stage and re-allocation of funds to
       Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan had not been required, the same objectives would
       have been achieved sooner.

3.4.     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating



                                                 18
3.4.1. In summary, the project’s performance regarding PDOs and implementation of
       various sub-components has been satisfactory barring a minor shortcoming in
       achieving some of the indicators especially by one of the states ‘Jharkhand? and
       efficiency with which these accomplishments were achieved has on the other
       hand been Moderately Satisfactory mainly because of longer duration of
       implementation resulting in lesser EIRR than at the time of project appraisal,
       Keeping all these in view, on balance the overall outcome of the operation is rated
       as Satisfactory given the continued relevance of the objectives and design of the
       project and overall satisfactory achievement of the project objectives and benefits
       obtained from the project as well as the program in participating states.

3.5.   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1. The project was part of a larger PMGSY program of GoI to provide connectivity
       to rural population. It envisaged providing benefits such as all season access to
       economic opportunities and social services, employment generation for new
       construction and maintenance, and improved access to rural transport services to
       the target population of the project. The project also aimed at engaging local
       communities in planning and monitoring, and improving awareness and
       empowerment of the end beneficiaries. The level of road user satisfaction with
       PMGSY roads is rated high in all the participating states as per the impact surveys
       being undertaken in participating states at regular intervals. The PMGSY roads
       were found to be having a significant impact on agriculture, employment, land
       prices, girls’ education, and access to health facilities in medical emergencies in
       the participating regions. In community interactions people expressed their
       satisfaction with road works and also stated that access to social and other
       physical infrastructure (schools, etc.) has improved. The social impact of the
       project and of the PMGSY program in general, has been so strong that (as
       mentioned earlier) there is a second PMGSY Rural Road Project being financed
       by the World Bank, which will also try and develop these themes.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2. The project’s impact on institutional development has been mainly in the
       following areas:

 1.     Training and Capacity Building      Officers of MORD, NRRDA, and various implementing
                                             agencies have been trained in the areas of maintenance
                                             management, quality control, orientation for PMGSY,

                                             examples in countries such as South Africa and the UK
 2.     National level rural road user      A methodology for undertaking poverty impact and road
        satisfaction surveys                 user satisfaction surveys has been developed by MORD
                                             for PMGSY roads in various states in addition to the
                                             participating states. The Bank contributed to this
                                             methodology by participating in various meetings and
                                             providing comments
 3.     Road Maintenance Management         Simple and effective maintenance management systems
        Systems                              have been developed by Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh,
                                             and Uttar Pradesh, and these would be used to prepare
                                             annual maintenance plans
                                            Himachal Pradesh has also started to allocate
                                             maintenance funds according to the priorities established
                                             under the annual maintenance plans, which is perceived
                                             by PWD officials as a significant improvement over
                                             traditional practices. The challenge is to make these
                                             systems regular and sustainable
 4.     OMMAS                               As a major step forward, MORD has made it mandatory
                                             for states to complete all data-entry in the OMMAS (On-
                                             line Monitoring, Management and Accounting System)
                                             and submit all progress reports through OMMAS in
                                             order to access future PMGSY funds

3.5.3. It may be noted that these initiatives would be carried forward and further refined
       as part of the PMGSY Rural Roads Project. For example, further refinements in
       OMMAS are being planned so to as to use it as an effective management tool for
       PMGSY by producing customized management and performance reports at state
       and national levels. Further, all participating states would be given support for
       collection of road inventory and condition data and in order to expand MMS to a
       state-wide Asset Management System (AMS). Training activities and the
       methodology for poverty impact and road user satisfaction surveys would also be
       carried forward/institutionalized under the new project(s).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4. While the project does not seem to have any unintended negative outcomes, some
       of the good practices that emerged from the project (e.g. strengthening of second
       tier quality control systems including loading of photographs on the PMGSY
       website for public viewing; improved formats for preparation of engineering
       designs; development of the local contractor industry; and efforts at
       mainstreaming of the ESMF into normal PMGSY works) have received attention
       as good practice examples worthy of being carried forward in subsequent
       programs.

3.6.   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops




                                              20
3.6.1. The Bank participated in State level workshops organized by the PWDs/SRRDA
       of Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh where
       implementing agencies, contractors, and consultants who were involved in
       preparation and implementation of the project were invited. The common findings
       that emerged included: (i) need to improve the quality of DPR by ensuring proper
       reflection of the ground realities; (ii) continued training and capacity building
       efforts for the contractors and the staff; (iii) strategy for using locally available
       materials and design innovations; (iv) changes in bid documents such as inclusion
       of price adjustment to reflect market reality etc.; and (v) need for Government
       support in the provision of the latest survey instruments, office equipment and
       inspection vehicles for field officers.

3.6.2. Further details of the suggestions/comments raised at the stakeholder workshops
       are provided at Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

4.1.1. Several of the initiatives undertaken or commenced under this project are being
       carried over by the PMGSY Rural Roads Project which proactively recognizes in
       its own design the main lessons that have been learned from this project (RRP),
       especially the need for flexibility in tailoring technical assistance programs to the
       needs of individual states as also for extra support/hand holding for states that
       may be lagging and are less pro-active. Specifically the agreed results in the new
       project have been formulated as a series of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI)
       which will be the basis for disbursement of funds during the project life, which
       also mitigates significant risks on sustainability and monitoring of a very large,
       spread out program.

4.1.2. However the complexity of the program and the likelihood of slippages in
       individual states in the event of a loosening of monitoring mechanisms remain a
       challenge. In addition, asset management is a risk that is still there but this risk is
       partly mitigated by the USD 4.2 billion approved under 13th Finance Commission,
       NRRDA’s decision to not sanction any new works unless 5 year maintenance
       funds are available and the activities of the new project to continue focus in this
       area. The increased awareness of these issues can in fact be attributed
       substantially to the activities of this project. Still, given the unmitigated risks that
       still remain, overall, the risk to development outcome of this operation is rated as
       Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance




                                              21
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

5.1.1. The Bank performance at ensuring quality at entry is rated as Moderately
       Satisfactory. The project design was built on a well-established program for
       larger rural connectivity – PMGSY - with high political commitment and focused
       on building the systems for the program further. Also, as observed from the
       continued relevance of the project development objective and the design of the
       project, due attention was paid at preparation and appraisal stage to ensure that the
       project was likely to achieve planned development outcomes. Having multiple
       states with varying implementation capacity as part of project design allowed the
       better states to have a “hand-holding? effect on the lagging states, thus not
       affecting overall progress much.

5.1.2. At the same time, while the PDO referred to “participating districts? for achieving
       broader and more sustainable access to markets and social services by the rural
       population, the indicators referred to the performance of the program as a whole
       in respective states rather than performance in project districts as such. However,
       though the indicators were for the program as a whole, the fact that the project
       covered 60% of the districts in participating states, and also that the target value
       of the indicators has been mostly exceeded, shows that the project as well as
       program have performed well.

5.1.3. The monitoring framework did not reflect outcomes relating to the institutional
       development components clearly. This was a shortcoming given that one of the
       major value additions that the project brought was in capacity building and
       institutional development. Also, one of the important lessons learned from past
       Bank projects, i.e. “considerable scope for reducing construction costs through
       adopting optimal design standards and promoting the use of local materials
       especially for low trafficked rural roads? was not adequately captured by the
       monitoring framework. As a result, this aspect remained somewhat lagging in
       terms of implementation.

5.1.4. Overall, the project was well prepared keeping in balance ring fencing by way of
       supporting a certain amount of new road construction and monitoring, ensuring
       that an otherwise much neglected area, i.e. maintenance of roads gets
       mainstreamed, and that the state government commits to financing this activity, at
       the same time influencing the overall program through capacity building.

5.1.5. Given some of the shortcomings especially in the monitoring framework, the
       overall Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated as Moderately
       Satisfactory.




                                            22
(b) Quality of Supervision

5.1.6. The Bank performance at ensuring quality of supervision is rated as Moderately
       Satisfactory. The frequency of full supervision missions was twice a year and
       these were supplemented by interim missions. Bank supervision at the
       implementation stage of the project was forthright in rightly identifying and
       flagging problem issues which were likely to affect the progress towards
       achievement of the project development objective. It must be recognized that a
       project of this nature had to maintain a balance between delving into micro issues
       at the level of each state on the one hand and capturing an overall picture of where
       achievement with respect to the overall development objectives stood on the other.
       Further, given that the project covered four states which were geographically
       quite widely spread out and had been chosen on the basis of their low levels of
       connectivity, there was an inherent complexity in the implementation of the
       project, and the Bank’s level of supervision largely held up to that challenge.
       Bank mission documents were clear in admitting issues and problems early on,
       which helped some states to show substantial improvement with the help of closer
       monitoring and hand holding. Supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects was
       satisfactory. However, re-allocation of funds to UP and Rajasthan from Jharkhand
       could have been done early on which would have reduced the requirement for
       project closing date extension. Also, while reallocating the funds, corresponding
       targets were not revised, which made it difficult to monitor the performance of
       different states. In addition some of the indicators were not regularly monitored.

5.1.7. Considering that there was only moderate shortcoming in the proactive
       identification of opportunities and resolution of the threats, the Bank performance
       with respect to ensuring Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

5.1.8. Given the Moderately Satisfactory rating for ensuring quality at entry and
       Moderately Satisfactory for Quality of Supervision, the overall Bank performance
       is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

5.2.1. The Government performance on this project is rated as Satisfactory. The
       Government (NRRDA and MORD) extended high levels of proactive support and
       close monitoring throughout the course of the project, to ensure that lagging states
       came up to a satisfactory level whenever slow decision-making threatened to
       hamper the progress of certain activities. For instance, the initial slow
       procurement in states such as UP and HP as well as Jharkhand, poor compliance
       with ESMF, and slow roll out of the computerized Financial Management System
       (FMS) were met with increased pressure and resources by NRRDA, which



                                            23
       undertook state-by-state monitoring reviews, as well as efforts at further training,
       improved documentation and stricter enforcement. These efforts and constant
       monitoring and hand holding support contributed to a large extent in bringing the
       project back on track by early 2009. NRRDA and MORD had also been
       participating in some of the Bank supervision missions to help faster
       implementation.

5.2.2. Government performance during project preparation was satisfactory, with
       NRRDA’s efforts of holding regional workshops on rural road maintenance and
       of critically reviewing and revising existing PMGSY procedures in areas such as
       procurement and financial management contributing to project readiness. Given
       the strong Government commitment and ownership towards achieving the project
       development objectives, Government performance on this project is rated as
       Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance

5.2.3. Implementing Agency performance on this project is rated as Moderately
       Satisfactory. At the outset, it may be stated that the project design and initial
       preparation activity recognized that the implementing capacity of the four state
       agencies chosen would differ. Thus while it was expected that implementation
       would be uneven, the challenge was that each of the agencies should be able to
       meet or exceed their targets, so that, as a whole, the project would be able to
       achieve its development objective.

5.2.4. Of the four states chosen, Rajasthan and HP were clearly more pro-active and
       performed well with a reasonable degree of monitoring and supervision. UP faced
       initial issues with respect to frequent changes in senior management, inadequate
       staffing and weak coordination amongst their agencies, but managed to overcome
       these with the help of pro-active support and hand-holding and finally met or
       rather exceed the targets set by the project.

5.2.5. Implementing capacity in Jharkhand state was an issue right from the beginning
       and unfortunately this was the one state where despite constant efforts by the
       Bank and Borrower agencies, capacity and willingness to implement the program
       and resolve implementation issues in a timely manner remained a challenge.
       Compliance with fiduciary requirements and adequate ownership and staffing for
       the same remained an issue. Eventually, in September 2009, proceeds earmarked
       for Jharkhand were re-allocated to Rajasthan and UP.

5.2.6. By the end of the project, the implementing agencies had achieved the targets
       substantially. After reallocation of funds to other states, overall target of new
       construction and upgrading has been achieved by 97% (9625 km against total
       9900 km). Another 325 km is in advance stage of completion and is expected to
       be completed by December 2012. However, given the delays and implementation
       issues faced in Jharkhand and the need to re-allocate funds from Jharkhand to



                                           24
        other states, the overall implementing agency performance is rated as Moderately
        Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

5.2.7. Given that Government performance on the project is rated as Satisfactory and
       Implementing Agency performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, overall
       Borrower performance on the project is rated at Moderately Satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

The important lessons learned from this project are outlined below. Some of these lessons
have already been taken into account while preparing the design of the PMGSY Rural
Roads Project.

6.1.1   In the case of large programs such as PMGSY, where the Bank’s contribution is
        small relative to the overall size of the program, it is important to agree on
        harmonized standards for fiduciary and safeguard requirements across
        Program and Bank funds. This is essential to avoid the issues that arose with
        respect to, for instance, procurement on this project, where Bank guidelines were
        different from those under PMGSY. Based on the lessons learnt from this project,
        a number of issues have been addressed in the PMGSY Rural Road Project which
        include:
         Use of e-procurement system with two part bidding and adequate safeguards.
         Optimizing contract packaging based on updated cost estimates and
            construction industry situation.
         Preparing cost estimates on the basis of updated realistic market prices.
         Refraining from rebidding of packages simply on the grounds that the price is
            more than the estimated cost. In such cases, a proper analysis to be carried out
            to determine if the price obtained against the tender is reasonable or not as
            compared to the market value.
         Enhancing competition through better information disclosure, contractor
            outreach programs and better phasing of procurement cycles.
         Developing an effective complaint handling system for the benefit of
            contractors and other stakeholders.
         Improving the system for maintenance and retrieval of records.
         NRRDA to play more effective role in procurement monitoring by increasing
            their staff strength and also through Project Performance Audit Consultancy
            Contract

6.1.2. Similarly, in such cases, the possible value additions of the Bank engagement,
       identified during project preparation should be built into the monitoring
       indicators so as to avoid these not getting implemented. For example, the
       possibility of design innovations and use of locally available materials could not
       be achieved as effectively as was envisaged.


                                            25
6.1.3. There was wide variation in the capacity of states to implement the program
       effectively. The design for similar projects should build in some flexibility in the
       level of support required by different states in order to tailor the technical
       assistance program to the needs of each state. To support the development of
       capacity at state level, there is a need to institutionalize training activities within
       existing national and state institutions like state technical agencies and other
       academic institutions engaged in PMGSY.

6.1.4. Further, from the challenges that were faced in managing such large and diverse
       programs, the evolution of the Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI) approach
       now being used for the PMGSY Rural Roads Project took place. This is a change
       in overall approach from a transaction based to a programmatic approach to
       support the implementation of the new project, wherein agreed results under the
       program have been formulated as a series of DLIs, which will be the basis for
       disbursement of funds during the project life. Performance against these
       indicators will determine the extent to which disbursements will be made at the
       end of each time period, i.e. the disbursements have been made performance
       linked.

6.1.5. Another important lesson relates to ensuring that maintenance of the road
       network is done in a regular and sustainable way, which in turn requires that
       reform in maintenance be carried out in an incremental and steady manner.

6.1.6. Some of the innovations introduced by the project that are now being
       mainstreamed for use in PMGSY works generally in project states include: the
       ESMF, use of the technical examiner system for ensuring quality of works,
       introduction of performance based maintenance management contracts and
       development of the maintenance management system which will be further
       evolved into an asset management system in these states. Based on the
       implementation experiences from the project and the preparatory work
       (particularly the diagnostic review) under the PMGSY Rural Roads Project,
       NRRDA revised its Standard Bidding Document to cover environment, health and
       safety issues as part of the normal PMGSY procedures even for the non-Bank
       funded works. The Operational Manual and IRC’s book of technical
       specifications for rural roads is also currently under revision through Bank’s
       support for PMGSY to include and better address environmental concerns – these
       initiatives will bring-in harmonization and improve environmental performance at
       the programme/sector level.

6.1.7. Need to introduce articulated social accountability systems during
       implementation. The project though well designed for community participation
       for the ‘project planning’ cycle through tools such as information dissemination;
       transect walk; collaboration for participatory mapping of the impacts; etc. had
       limited design for ‘community participation and supervision’ during the stage of
       construction. To achieve comprehensive community participation, social



                                             26
        accountability systems through models such as Community Score Cards, Social
        Audit, etc. may be implemented.

6.1.8   Need to introduce innovative solutions for reducing environmental footprint.
        Now that the project has helped in raising awareness and understanding about
        environmental issues, there is a need to move towards innovative solutions for
        further reducing the environmental footprint of the program. Efforts in this
        direction could include: (i) addressing biodiversity related concerns in the
        selection, planning and design of rural roads (as some roads can induce
        development in heavily forested and biodiversity rich areas); and (ii) reduction in
        material requirements (such as cement and aggregates) by introducing improved
        materials (including reuse/recycling) and technology.

6.1.9   Extension of Rural Development program to the adversely affected. There are
        currently no provisions in other rural development programs for preferential
        treatment of people affected by PMGSY. It is therefore important to identify
        certain rural development income generation/beneficiary development schemes
        for the benefit of vulnerable PAPs affected by building rural roads under the
        PMGSY, and amend those identified schemes to build in the criteria and
        provisions for inclusion of adversely affected PAPs of PMGSY belonging to
        vulnerable sections.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.    The Borrower’s version of the ICR was received and is appended in Annex 7
        along with the Borrower’s comments on the ICR. While broadly agreeing with
        the assessment of the project reflected in the ICR, the Borrower has emphasized
        adoption of a more flexible approach, especially in procurement, tailored to the
        specific situation of a particular state or particular areas within a state so as to
        avoid repetitive bidding due to lack of response from contractors.

(b)     Co-financiers

7.2.    There were no co-financiers on this project.

(c)     Other partners and stakeholders

7.3.    Not applicable.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Impact of All Weather Road Access
The economic and social benefit analysis was based on a cross section comparison of
connected and unconnected habitations. During the economic analysis at loan processing
stage, a detailed study was carried out to assess the impact of all-weather connected roads
in 40 villages (both connected and unconnected of similar nature). The selection of a pair
of connected and unconnected village was made in a manner to ensure that the paired
villages have similar resource bases and a similar distance from the main road leading to
a market. Detailed surveys were undertaken in each village to determine production,
agricultural output and consumer commodity prices, social indicators and levels of traffic
generated by the villages.

The provision of all-weather access can have very substantial impacts on the social and
economic development prospects of rural areas. Access to markets is improved,
competition among traders often increases, the prices of agricultural inputs and consumer
goods fall, access to outside employment improves, and access to social facilities outside
the village improves. Better access may facilitate the development of educational and
medical services within the village and help to train personnel. Roads, particularly paved
roads, encourage the establishment of regular public transport to the village. While all-
weather access is not the panacea for rural development, it is generally a necessary
condition for sustained economic and social development.

Initial Analysis
On completion of RRP, revised economic analysis has been carried out for the project for
the ICR. At the time of appraisal of the parent project, economic analysis was carried out
for 914 rural roads with a total length of 3,668 km. The PMGSY program is not based on
the prioritization of roads on economic criteria nor has it prescribed specific design
standards based on estimated traffic levels. To indicate the potential economic and social
benefits of the program, and thus this Credit/Loan, the Bank undertook a study to
estimate the economic and social benefits of providing all weather access roads to
different villages in the four selected States: Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh,
and Jharkhand. The study was also designed to determine the appropriate road design
standards (investment) in relation to the potential traffic and acceptable economic returns.
The approach used in the selection of roads and their design standard, to be funded
through this Credit/Loan, is therefore cost effectiveness, based on economic analysis.

Under RRP, all the project roads were proposed for upgrade to single lane bitumen roads.
These roads are either of new connectivity or the upgrading gravel roads. The economic
viability of project sections due to RRP interventions was obtained due to increase in per-
capita agricultural productivity, reduction in vehicle operation cost of and saving in travel
time cost of passengers/goods with respect to without improved road sections. The
overall economic feasibility results (EIRR) for RRP roads for four participating states
arrived during the loan processing stage is summed up in Table A1.

Approach to Economic Analysis
The initial analysis carried out during the loan processing stage (as reported in PAD)
needed to be updated to the present ICR analysis. For the ICR analysis, most of the
parameters considered during the initial analysis are kept as same. However, the ICR
analysis has considered certain parameters that had changed during the implementation
period (up to the project closing year) and incorporated these, in order to assess how far
the initial economic analysis results hold good after completion. Such major parameters
that are captured from the actual implementation data include:
         Revised project coverage
         Construction period



                                               32
          Completed capital cost
          Phasing of capital cost

Economic Appraisal Methodology:
Most of the candidate roads are designed to provide reliable all-weather motorized access
to previously inaccessible habitations. Therefore, economic analysis based solely on
measuring the reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) of existing vehicles is unlikely
to measure fully the benefits of improving accessibility:
         There may be very little vehicular traffic – people have to walk and carry
            goods to the nearest road
         An all-weather road, with improved pavement conditions, often results in a
            substantial change in the composition of traffic – from tractors to buses and
            trucks
         The intensity of agricultural production may increase in response to higher
            prices/lower input costs and a higher proportion of crops may be sold outside
            the village
         The pattern of cropping may change to take advantage of cheaper and more
            reliable access to market
         Substantial benefits may be generated by better access to social infrastructure
            and improved mobility through the establishment of regular public transport
The economic analysis of rural roads is much more complex than the analysis of
upgrading existing all-weather roads, requiring a more multi-dimensional approach.
However, the size of individual rural road projects is generally too small to justify the
cost of detailed analysis and a more generic analysis need to be undertaken.

The appraisal methodology used for this project utilizes the parameters of difference
between the connected and unconnected villages surveyed during the Initial Analysis.

The economic analysis assumes a project life of 15 years with no residual. The costs
include the initial construction cost and subsequent maintenance costs, including the
periodic resurfacing of the road. The benefits include the additional agricultural
production expected, reduced VOC and the travel time savings of vehicle passengers.
Major assumptions arrived out of detailed investigations and research during the Initial
Analysis (2004) for calculating the benefits and life cycle cost flow were used for the
present analysis with the appropriate changes that happened during the implementation.

Main Assumptions:
(a) Benefits
Agriculture produce surplus: The earlier surveys demonstrated that connected villages
have significantly higher agricultural production values than unconnected villages.
Changes in production and cropping patterns take time to develop, and other constraints
may allow only partial adjustment by farmers in previously unconnected villages. A
conservative approach is adopted: with a road connection the value/capita of agricultural




                                           33
production in the previously unconnected villages increases9 but only to 60 percent of the
present production differential between connected and unconnected villages. The
agricultural adjustment process is assumed to take 5 years. Subsequently, it is assumed
that this benefit will grow at 1.6% annually during the remaining analysis period, after
considering the average observed rural population growth rate of 1.68% (2001-2011).

Traffic and its growth: It was assumed that when villages are connected with an all-
weather road, their vehicle generation pattern will change to approximately those found
in the presently connected villages. Vehicle generation pattern used in the Initial Analysis
as well as the present analysis is summed up in Table A3. The traffic was assumed to
grow at 5 percent for the normal traffic. No attempt is made to differentiate between
“normal? and “generated? traffic and to apply different values to the flows in general. In
Himachal Pradesh, where considerably more traffic was observed for connected roads, it
may be due to its longer length and more additional villages covered. So to be on the
conservative side, the average of the other three states (Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh &
Jharkhand) was used for all the states in the present analysis for the calculation of traffic
related benefits, as followed in the earlier analysis.

Vehicle operating costs and Value of Time: The savings in the vehicle operating costs,
VOC, for each vehicle type were estimated using the SP:30 of Indian Road Congress,
Manual on Economic Analysis of Highway Projects for different type of roads. The
model provides the VOC for both motorized and non-motorized vehicles. In order to
estimate the benefits of savings in time for the users of village roads, the value of time for
the passenger was assumed to be half of the unit value determined for the passengers

  ‘The data illustrate the very wide diversity of conditions in the rural areas of India, but, taking all the
villages together, the average per capita production in the connected villages is about Rs.2400 higher than
in the unconnected villages’. – Annex 9, Economic and Financial Analysis of PAD

(b) Costs
Construction costs: The completed cost of construction for black-top for the four states
of UP, Rajasthan, HP and Jharkhand was collected from NRRDA on annual basis and
after discounting to 2004 level were used in the ICR analysis (Table A5). The financial
costs were converted into economic costs by using a conversion factor (CF) of 0.9.

On comparison of planned cost/construction period with the actual completion, Himachal
Pradesh was found to have the maximum of both cost and time overruns followed by
Uttar Pradesh. But Jharkhand and Rajasthan states were found to have reduced
construction cost and increased construction period (Table A6). All these overruns will
affect the economic return potential.

Maintenance costs: The maintenance costs for the different surfaces vary with the cost of
materials and the damage resulting from both weather and traffic. For black-top roads, it
is assumed that the road would require resurfacing every eighth year, at a cost of Rs.
200,000/km, and that annual maintenance during the intervening periods would average
Rs.5,000/km. Again, the financial costs are converted into economic costs using a factor
of 0.9.

Results of Economic Analysis
The economic model was applied to the project roads in the four States under RRP,
covering over 2,474 roads representing a total of about 9,625 km. As the project size, its
composition etc. of the ‘Initial Analysis’ and the present ‘ICR Analysis’ vary
considerably along with large number of individual project roads, the present economic
analysis was developed for an average road arrived from state aggregates. Data
availability concerns for individual roads are also a reason for the average analysis
approach. Both the economic rates of return and modified economic rates of return
(assumes that the returns from the investment only yield the opportunity cost of capital,
both at 12%) were calculated. The analysis indicated a relatively wide spread in the
economic results among the states as shown in Table A7 below.

   Note: Modified EIRR assumes 12% cost of capital and reinvestment rate
The EIRR obtained for the RRP roads is in the range of 10.4% for Himachal Pradesh to
26% for Uttar Pradesh (11.2% to 18% for modified EIRR) and the combined EIRR for all


                                                      36
four states was 18.8% (Modified EIRR – 15.1%).

The sensitivity analysis was conducted after assuming a 20% reduction of yearly benefits
for the analysis period10 and EIRR/Modified EIRR obtained for road stretches is in the
range of 7.1% to 21.2% for EIRR and 9.4% to 16.1% for Modified EIRR which are more
than the 12%, except for Himachal Pradesh.

In all states, except Himachal Pradesh, the NPV discounted at 12% is positive confirming
the economic justification of the completed project even though the cost of civil works
increased significantly. The EIRR for all the states except for Himachal Pradesh is more
than 12%.

The likely economic returns from connecting villages with all-weather paved roads vary
considerably, depending on construction costs, the distance from the existing all-weather
road, the size of the village and the production differential. Rates of return are high in
Uttar Pradesh, despite the high construction costs, because of the large production
differential, relatively short length of sample roads (2.6 km) and relatively high
populations served. The returns on the roads in Himachal Pradesh are low, reflecting the
high cost overruns (34%), relatively high average length of completed roads (6.4 km),
high time overruns and the less average beneficiaries per village. Jharkhand and
Rajasthan have performed in between these two extremes, with all impacts discussed
above. However these two states have not been affected by cost overruns and the average
completed cost was less than the planned cost.

Compared to the combined EIRR for all states of 33% during the planning stage, the
combined post completion EIRR has come down considerably to 18.8% and this trend is
observed in all states, but with difference in intensity. Major reasons that can be
accounted for the reduction in EIRR include:
            Project Coverage: Considerable negative change in project coverage in
               terms of reduced average road length and average project beneficiaries
               have together resulted in the estimated project benefits (Table A8).
            Project Beneficiaries: All the states, except Rajasthan, have experienced
               reduction in the average project beneficiaries’ coverage. Maximum
               reduction of 59% in Himachal Pradesh followed by 40% in Jharkhand and
               26% in Uttar Pradesh.
            Cost Overruns: Cost escalation is very high in Himachal Pradesh (34.5%)
               followed by Uttar Pradesh (7.6%). However the other two states were
               found to have reduced completed cost as discussed above in Table A6.
            Time Overruns: On an average, all the roads became operational later than
               expected at appraisal from six to twelve months and as a result the savings
               in the revised economic analysis are reduced.

   As cost overruns and time overruns during the implementation period was already captured in the
analysis, the only possible risk of benefit reduction during the operation period was considered for
sensitivity analysis

Distribution of Benefits
The provision of all-weather road access has a pervasive impact, affecting not only
production and facilities within the village but also improved access to economic and
social opportunities outside the village. The entire village population should benefit from
improved access to educational and health facilities and lower prices for basic consumer
goods. The expected increase in the value of agricultural production will benefit farmers
and may increase the demand for labor, thus improving wage rates for landless laborers.
Overall, the project should reduce the levels of poverty and social deprivation in the
previously unconnected villages.

Conclusions
The above results show the robustness of the economic feasibility indicators under
normal and adverse sensitivity scenarios where the benefits are decreased significantly.
The EIRR for all states except Himachal Pradesh is more than 12%. This justifies the
project investment with more risk absorption capacity. However, this sensitivity is
unlikely to happen as: (a) traffic is expected to grow to accompany the current economic
growth, (b) there is little uncertainty on the cost of the works as all the contracts are
completed, and (c) VOCs are unlikely to be reduced in view of the past trend for the
prices of inputs such as fuel, lubricants, tires, and salaries.

The estimated economic feasibility results are much lower as qualitative project benefits
such as tourism development, increased education and employment due to better
accessibility, better road environment are not considered in this analysis.

1.      The Bank participated in State level workshops organized by the PWDs/SRRDA
of Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh inviting implementing
agencies, contractors, consultants who were involved in preparation and implementation
of the project. The objectives of these workshops were as under:

       (i)     The extent to which project development objectives were achieved;
       (ii)    Feedback on factors and problems that affected project implementation;
       (iii)   Lessons emerging for enhancing effectiveness of future Bank
               engagements with the sector.

2.     The discussions at the Workshops revolved around four important themes, viz.

          Planning and Project Preparation including ESMF;
          Procurement and Project Implementation;
          Maintenance of Project Roads and Core Road Network;
          Concerns of Contractors.

3.     In addition to participation at the workshops, the Bank had also brief discussions
with the senior officers of the SRRDAs with a view to obtaining their views on lessons
learning.

4.     The summary of important findings and lessons learning during these Workshops
are brought out in Table A9.

(vi) Suggestions of STAs and Technical
       Examiners        were    valuable       and
       incorporated in DPRs. However,
       sometimes they were guided by ceiling
       on costs per km where so specified.
(vii) ESMF has been helpful in addressing
       environmental and social concerns.
       Requirements like topsoil conversation,
       drainage, plantation, identification of
       borrow areas, and disposal sites are
       addressed. Sometimes lack of land
       availability and cooperation from public
       makes implementation difficult.

       all road works including PMGSY. They
       were not able to devote full time and
       exclusive attention to Project roads

       some cases.
(vi) There has been considerable time gap in
       some areas between sanction of works
       and execution and even delays during
       execution. Since there is no price
       escalation in the contracts, contractors
       suffered financial losses and their quoted
       prices became unworkable.
(vii) Training of PIU staff in contract
       management, quality control, financial
       systems      and      ESMF       guidelines
       contributed significantly in improving

      exemption under the project has also
      helped. However, facilities for training
      of contractors are still inadequate and
      government support is required for
      setting up State level training centres.

1.     Introduction

1.1     Rural Roads have been seen as an entry point for poverty alleviation since the
lack of access is accepted universally as a fundamental factor in continuation of poverty.
There is a growing body of a empirical evidence that links transport investment to the
improved well-being of the poor. In India, the Rural Roads are constitutionally the
responsibility of the States. The States made all efforts to provide connectivity to
unconnected villages and in many cases, the priority was given to connectivity of
villages with high population resulting in improvement of connectivity of such villages
still overall connectivity levels remained low. Only about 60 percent habitations got all
weather connectivity by the year 2000. There were several States where connectivity to
even higher population habitations remained poor. In view of importance of Rural
connectivity as an entry point for poverty alleviation, the Government of India launched
a rural roads development programme known as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(PMGSY) in December 2000. The PMGSY envisaged connectivity to all habitations with
population of 500 and above. However, in case of hill areas, deserts and tribal areas, the
population threshold is relaxed – being connectivity to all habitations with population
above 250. Under this programme, construction of roads is 100 percent centrally funded
and maintenance is the responsibility of the States. Routine maintenance for five years is
to be done through the same contractor who constructs these roads. The major source of
funding envisaged was out of diesel cess. Currently, a cess equal to Re.0.75 per litre of
diesel is set apart for development of rural roads.

1.2    Based on experience of implementation of various Rural Road Development
Programmes in the States in the past and with a view to achieve the objectives envisaged
under PMGSY, Government of India adopted quality centered strategy for
implementation of this ambitious programme. Detailed guidelines for Planning, Standard
and Specifications, Preparation of DPRs, Works Procurement, Dedicated Institutional
Arrangement, A Three Tier Quality Management Programme and well defined
mechanism for ensuring maintenance of Rural Roads have been put in place. The
Ministry of Rural Development administers the programme at the Centre and the
National Rural Roads Development Agency was set up at the centre to provide
managerial and technical support to the programme and works are executed on the
ground by the engineering units of the States. A conscious decision was taken by the
government that these roads should be well engineered and be of sound quality and
receive regular maintenance after construction. In order to accelerate the progress under
the programme and supplement the available financial resources, the Central Government
also decided to approach the multilateral agencies like the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank for financial assistance.

1.3    It was a matter of encouragement that the World Bank evinced interest in the
programme since its inception. Particular mention is needed here with respect to
importance of maintenance and preservation of rural road assets to be created under the
PMGSY and works procurement systems. The standard bidding document under the



                                           46
PMGSY was developed by Government of India on the basis of World Bank Bidding
Document W-II. A policy paper for dialogue on the issue of maintenance was prepared
with the assistance of the Bank and discussed among all stakeholders at three regional
workshops organized by the MORD with the States in the year 2002, where the Bank and
other experts also participated. Subsequently, the MORD approached the World Bank
through the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, for financial
assistance for construction of rural roads under the PMGSY.

1.4    The World Bank considered the proposal of Government of India and given that
the Bank’s Assistance Strategy itself was poverty reduction and socio-economic growth
of the country, the programme of PMGSY fitted well into the portfolio of the World
Bank.

2.       Project Component and Cost

2.1    Through a series of quick dialogues, the contours of the World Bank assistance
were finalized. The project comprised the following components:

         Component 1: Construction and improvement of 9,900 km of rural roads in
         participating districts of the States of Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan
         and Uttar Pradesh.

         Component 2: Maintenance of core road network, about 100,000 km, in the
         participating districts.

         Component 3: Institutional Development covering technical assistance to:

     (a) Rural road agencies to help them plan, procure and execute works including
     maintenance and social and environment management measures.

     (b) Contractors for training in efficient and quality execution.

     (c) MORD and NRRDA to further enhance their capacity for technical and
     managerial support to the programme and the States.

2.2    It may be added that all the four States selected were low connectivity States at
the time of approaching the Bank for financial assistance.

3.       Project Revision

3.1    There were no major revisions to the project except that some works originally
envisaged for Jharkhand were dispensed with and reallocation of funds was got approved
to meet with the requirements of consultancies, human resource and institutional
development.




                                              47
3.2    There were no other financing sources for the project except for counterpart funds
by the States for maintenance of the core road network in participating districts.

4.     Implementation

4.1      The implementing agencies for the project were MORD and NRRDA at the centre
and the States of Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The project
was approved by the Bank in September 2004 and the States were gearing up for
procurement of works having a good shelf of approved works at their disposal at the time
of entry of project. Some project works got delayed initially in the participating districts
of Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh due to some delays in preparation of
DPRs and lack of availability of contractors to the qualifications and experience imposed
by the World Bank. Notably, due to constant efforts of both the Bank and the NRRDA in
institutional development activities of the PIUs of the States and training of contractors
project managers and site engineers, situation was brought up to mark. Further,
implementation did continue to suffer in Jharkhand despite best of efforts by the NRRDA.
In hind sight, the qualification thresholds for the contractors in this State could have been
relaxed to promote entry of local small contractors with additional monitoring and hand
holding support by the staff of the Technical Examiners engaged on the Project. Even
size of each individual package could be reduced in areas where response of contractors
was poor.

4.2     The project had good financial management system because of the already
functional OMMAS by the NRRDA and MORD. The NRRDA continued to supervise
the operations by the States and provide regular accounts to the Bank. The support of the
Bank during their supervision missions to strengthen the reporting of financial picture
also helped.

4.3     The social and environmental assessment and plan to mitigate the adverse effect,
where so found was carried out as part of both DPR preparation and implementation
stage. In this context, a number of training courses organized for the staff of the PIUs and
consultants proved useful in enhancing capacity of the States’ implementing units. By the
end of the project, dedicated cells for ESMF are becoming functional in the States. ESMF
cells are also mainstreaming now in across the country. Under the PMGSY, land for rural
roads is being largely received through voluntary donations. Under the project,
communities were duly involved in joint decision making to finalise the alignment
through transect walk and thereafter seeking the assistance of revenue officials in
verifying ownership records and required mutation. It must be mentioned to the credit of
the Bank environment team, that their regular interaction during the project duration also
helped considerably in better implementation of ESMF safeguards. The NRRDA
encouraged the States to prepare booklets highlighting good social and environment
practices in respect of rural roads for mainstreaming them in other rural road works as
well. The process of transact walk and active involvement of community in alignment
fixation has become the part of PMGSY guidelines and is being implemented throughout
the programme.




                                            48
4.4     In respect of maintenance of the core road network in the participating districts of
the States concerned, the implementation experience has been mixed. Only after the
MORD stipulated to the States that the construction funds would be released only if the
States would specifically earmark funds for maintenance, did the situation start
improving. Initially, maintenance of core road network was neglected and it received
attention mainly towards the last two years of the project. The MORD is seriously
concerned with the maintenance issue of rural roads and is reviewing its current policy in
the light of decade’s experience of running the programme both, with or without the
assistance of the multilateral agencies. While there is need for expanding the network to
provide connectivity to hitherto unconnected habitations in remote areas, it is equally
imperative to ensure regular maintenance of rural roads that already exist or being
constructed under the PMGSY so that benefits of access continue to be available to rural
people on a sustained basis. One of the biggest achievements of the project was to bring
maintenance on the fore-front of PMGSY and developing appropriate process for
maintenance. Now the attention to maintenance is pre- requisite for continuation of the
programmes in the States in general.

4.5    Both the NRRDA and the States benefited immensely from the Technical
Assistance component of the project in enhancing the capacity for efficient delivery of
the projects and programmes under the PMGSY. Several officers of the SRRDAs of the
States were exposed to training in different areas of project planning, project estimate,
procurement, quality control, project management, dispute resolution, ESMF, financial
management. However, the needs are huge and this has to be a regular and continuous
exercise. The NRRDA has been requesting the States to formulate their training calendar
so that it provides the much needed financial and other assistance in this regard. The
contractors also require continuous dosage of skill development efforts for their workers
and equipment operators. As a result of the other on-going projects by the Bank, the
NRRDA would pursue further on this aspect.

5.     Brief Assessment of the Project by the Borrower

5.1     World Bank Project RRP-I has very effectively supplemented the achievements of
connectivity through good all weather roads as envisaged under PMGSY. The major
objectives of the RRP-I project were well achieved and even targets of providing
connectivity to eligible habitations finally got exceeded in the project. Generally, there
has been positive impact on access to social infrastructure such as schools and health
centres.

5.2    The basic contribution of the RRP-I has been with respect to overall institutional
development and development of management process under PMGSY. The TA
component provided various opportunities in development of institutional setup. Overall,
the project received good appreciation from various stakeholders including the
communities served by the roads covered under the programme. This was due to regular
pursuit by the NRRDA, review meetings by MORD and active support of the State
Governments and PIUs at field levels. The Bank supervision missions were a constant
source of both monitoring and support in addressing the issues that cropped up in specific



                                            49
packages for execution. Their minute detailing helped in successful completion of the
project. However, the Bank could have shown more flexibility towards procurement
guidelines in respect of weak states like Jharkhand where challenge was definitely unique
compared to other States of the project. Holding on to the conditions stricter than the
normal PMGSY guidelines, the Bank’s insistence compelled significant reduction of
works in the State of Jharkhand and to that extent the cause of the State got suffered. This
will need to be made up now on a fast track basis.

5.3    The experience of engaging Technical Examiners on the project was fruitful.
Their staff provided useful support to the PIUs in quality execution of works by the
contractors. In some cases, their contribution in review of DPRs was also commendable.

6.     Lessons learnt
       (i)   The adoption of Decentralized planning through preparation of District
             Rural Roads Plan and Development of Core-Network has been extremely
             useful not only from the point of view of taking up new connectivity but
             also from the perspective of upgradation and maintenance of overall Rural
             Roads Network not only limited to PMGSY.

       (ii)    Capacity building of staff of SRRDAs (HQs and PIUs) needs to be a
               continuing activity. The field staff along with the staff of NRRDA and
               MORD also need to be exposed to good national/international practices in
               project planning, design and execution.

       (iii)   The Bidding Document under PMGSY was developed using World Bank
               Bidding Document W-II after due consultations with the States, however,
               the World Bank insisted upon using the document of NCB in its original
               form. The capacity of the local contractors was limited at the time of
               inception of the programme and it was difficult to award the work on the
               basis of World Bank NCB on time. Some delays in tendering and award
               resulted because of some stringent processes and qualifications. The
               procurement team of World Bank was projected certain alternatives which
               could not be accepted. However, for future the World Bank may find them
               useful for road and other projects.

       (iv)    ESMF codes of practices and mitigation measures should become an
               integral part of DPRs and tender documents.

       (v)     More stress needs to be laid on use of locally available and marginal
               materials in construction to reduce burden on quarrying of aggregates.
               How to make this operational would require considerable support of
               academic and research institutions.

       (vi)    There is need for a more critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses
               of each individual SRRDA so that the institutional strengthening and hand
               holding support is geared upto their specific needs.



                                            50
(vii)    There is need to review the current policy of 5-year maintenance from the
         same contractor, in consultation with the States and the contractors
         associations to find a healthy solution.

(viii)   Measures required to strengthen the monitoring and supervision
         arrangements by the PIUs over the works executed by the Contractors.

                   COMMENT OF BORROWER
       ON IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT

1      The Borrower broadly agrees with the assessment of the project reflected in the
Bank draft ICR. It would be the Borrower’s effort to continue and strengthen institutional
and capacity building under the on-going PMGSY RRPII as a follow up to the completed
RRPI project.

2      The Bank will do well to also learn from the project to adopt a more flexible
approach tailored to the specific situation of a particular State or particular areas within a
State so as to avoid the repetitive bidding where there is lack of response from the
contractors. A Procurement Manual has been finalized recently as part of the on-going
PMGSY project. This is currently under use. Experience gained out of implementation of
the Manual in the next one year or so should be utilized for a revisit and refinement
where necessary in consultation with the stakeholders, viz. SRRDAs and contractors, etc.
