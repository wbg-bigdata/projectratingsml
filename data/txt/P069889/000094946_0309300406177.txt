Environmental ftWanagement Plan for P1B
A_izoram State Roads Project Phase-11
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
The Mizoram State Roads Project (MSRP) is being prepared and implemented by the Mizoram
Public Works Department (MPWD) with International Development Association (IDA) assistance.
Phase I of the project is under implementation following appraisal by the World Bank in 2002.
Phase II of MSRP endeavours to complete the enhanced connectivity between Buangpui and
Lunglei (Figure 1.1) subsequent to the Phase I. In addition, 230 km of existing state highways will
also undergo major maintenance. This Environmental Management Plan is prepared to facilitate
implementation of environmental management measures by the Contractor along P1 B route.
1.2 PROPOSED WORKS UNDER UPGRADATION COMPONENT
Activities under the upgradation component are geared to widen the road along the existing
alignment for most of the stretch to intermediate lane standards (5.5m) with side drains+nd
shoulders. Most of the widening will be affected by cutting on the hillside, with only s hort
realignments to smoothen curves on the valley side. New culverts and bridges are to ,ebe
constructed including one major bridge across Mizoram's longest river, the Tlawng. Adequate
slope protection works have been included in design and the pavement is being rebuilt to
structurally sound designs. Adequate provision is made for road signs and other road features
required for making travel on the road safer and more comfortable.
1.3 BASELINE AND IMPACTS
An Env ronmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is conducted for the PlB corridor. The study
indicates issues of waste disposal and slope stability as the major.concerns. Haphazard dumping
of waste will affect the floral habitat of the region and also cause dust pollution. The
geomorphological studies indicate the formation to be of recent origin and are being subjected to
comprehensive erosion. Disturbance to the existing slopes is likely to trigger landslides. Hence,
appropriate slope protection measures are to be adopted.
The study indicated presence.gf Important Biological Areas (IBA's) outside the corridor of impact.
Protection of these areas by--appropriate precautionary measures is the foremost task for the
contractor. However, these-areas being not unique to this region, the impact is not adverse.
Availability of water is a major concern in Mizoram. Though water for construction along the
project corridor is scarce, there are perennial sources in the valleys, which can be tapped. This
does not impact the community users, as these are located in the higher reaches of the hills.
1.4 CLEARANCES TO BE OBTAINED BY THE CONTRACTOR
The contractor shall obtain required clearances and NoC from various agencies for operating his
equipments and carrying out construction operations. The clearances to be obtained are:
*    Clearance of Engineer for location and layout of Worker's Camp, Equipment yard and
Storage yard.
*    Clearance of Engineer for Traffic Management Plan for each section of the route after it has
been handed over for construction.
*    In addition, the Contractor will submit an assurance to comply with the EMP provisions to
.the Engineer.

CHAPTER 3 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Since Phase I of MSRP is already being implemented by the MPWD, the arrangements for the
Phase 11 build on the suggestions of the Sectoral Environmental Assessment using the
experiences of Phase I as guiding lights. By-and-large, the project implementation is going on as
envisaged.
3.1 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNIT, MPWD
The Project Implementatiour Unit (PIU) is currently staffed with 7 full-time officials at PWD
headquarters in Aizawl. A Project Director (PD), an officer of the Superintending Engineer rank.
heads the PIU. The PD is assisted by three officials (two Executive Engineers and a Special Land
Acquisition Officer), one each looking after procurement, environmental and Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R&R) issues. These officers in turn have one assistant engineer each, with an
account officer also assisting the Executive Engineer in-charge of procurement. Another Assistant
Engineer (AE) will be procured for implementatiom of EMP provisions for Phase - II.
The Environmental Cell within the PIU, MPWD includes the Executive Engineer, who will provide
guidance to develop, implement and strengthen the environmental management practices within
MPWD on this and other future projects. The Assistant Environmental Engineer will be entrusted
with field duties and will be the PIU's interface with the Contractors' field staff during
implementation. They operate, as representatives of the Employer and as a unit are to ensure
that the MSRP complies with the environmental covenants of the agreement with the IDA.
3.2 OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
The PIU has availed services of several consultants for the project - for assisting it with
preparation, institutional strengthening and supervision of implementation of upgradation
component. The consultants are:
i.     The Project Coordinating Consultants (PCC) whose presence will remain beyond
preparation until the end of the project for providing the SC with an overview of the
environmental issues that will need to be addressed during implementation.
ii.    The Supervision Consultants (SC), to be procured by International Competitive Bidding
ICB to assist the PIU with implementation of up gradation component. As the 'Engineer'
for the Contract, the SC will certify the Contractors' bills.
Implementation of the actual construction will be through Contractors procured through ICB. The
project will also require monitoring by other government agencies at various points in the project
cycle. The ones that are important from the construction perspective are the Mizoram Pollution
Control Board and the State Department of Environment and Forests.
Phase 11 of MSRP will also utilise the services of a local NGO fo; the implementation of R&R
activities as well as for the plantation on the roadside, where extra land is available and has
recently been declared as road reserve. The NGO will follow the specifications appended to the
Environmental Management Plan for planting of saplings and maintain the plantation for 3 years.
In addition to this, they will also be entrusted the function of occasignally visiting Important
Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) already identified. In these stretches, they can motivate the local people
for conservation efforts and supplement the endeavours of the Environmental Specialist. They
can also send their representatives for training programmes conducted by the CS and/or PIU so
that these grass roots level workers can go back to the site and train village council

representatives of settlements. The entire implementation arrangement is shown in the flow
diagram in Figure 3.1.
3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CAPACITY BUILDING WITHIN MPWD
The preparation of two phases of MSRP and the training programmes that have been organised
during this period have sensitised members of the PIU and many key MPWD officials to
environmental issues in the project. Targeted training modules and a clear setting of priorities by
the PIU have been the key to success of the training so far. This needs to be built upon during the
course of remainder of the MSRP so that the MPWD benefits from the expertise acquired by its
staff well beyond the completion of MSRP.
The focus of future training programmes has to be on implementation. Since project preparation is
drawing to a close, the MPWD officials can concentrate on simultaneous progress of Phase I and
11. The proposed training should allow the officials to enhance their skills for effective monitoring of
project by understanding the formats developed for reporting. Issues that the training can cover
include the stability of slopes, their protection using civil engineering structures as well as
bioengineering techniques, biodiversity and its "protection, etc. For the former, on-site trai1*g
such as in Nepal can be considered while for the latter training can be sourced from t1le
biodiversity centre being planned in Imphal for the Northeast region.
In addition, close interaction is required among members of the PIU responsible for the
Environmental and R&R activities since it is envisaged that the two aspects will have a
considerable overlap. It is envisaged that the training as part of MSRP will include training on
several issues important for both teams simultaneously. The following modules are to be
undertaken as part of MSRP Phase II:

CHAPTER 4 MONITORING AND REPORTING SYSTEM
4.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
The monitoring programme is devised to ensure that the envisaged purpose of the project is
achieved and results in the desired benefit to the target population. To ensure the effective
implementation of the EMP, it is essential that an effective monitoring programme be designed
and carried out. Broad objectives of the monitoring programme are:
*  To evaluate the performance of mitigation measures proposed in the EMP
*  To suggest improvements in the management plans, if required
*  To satisfy the statutory and community obligations
*  To provide feedback on adequacy of Environmental Impact Assessmnent
The monitoring programme contains monitoring plan for all performance indicators, reporting
formats and necessary budgetary provisions. Monitoring plan for performance indicators and
reporting system is presented in the following secqtons.
4.2 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Physical, biological and environmental management components identified as of particular
significance in affecting the environment at critical locations have been suggested as
Performance Indicators (Pls). The Performance Indicators shall be evaluated under three heads:
(a)    Environmental condition indicators to determine efficacy of environmental management
measures in control of air, noise, water and soil pollution;
(b)    Environmental management indicators to determine compliance with the suggested
environmental management measures
(c)    Operational performance indicators have also been devised to determine efficacy and
utility of the mitigation/enhancement designs proposed
The Performance Indicators and monitoring plans prepared for MSRP Phase - II are worked out.
For each of the environmental components, the monitoring plan specifies the parameters to be
monitored; location of the monitoring sites: frequency and duration of monitoring. The monitoring
plan also specifies the applicable standards, implementation and supervising responsibilities. The
monitoring plan for the various environmental condition indicators of the project in construction
and operation stages is presented in Table 4.1.

4.2     REPORTING SYSTEM
Reporting system provides the necessary feedback for project management to ensure quality of
the works and that the program is on schedule. The rationale for a reporting system is based on
accountability to ensure that the measures proposed as part of the Environmental Management
Plan get implemented in the project. Reporting system for the suggested monitoring program
operates at two levels as:
*  Reporting for environmental condition indicators and environmental management indicators
*  Reporting for operational performance indicators at the PIU level.
The reporting system will operate linearly with the contractor reporting to the Supervision
Consultant, who in turn shall report to the Project Director. All reporting by the Supervision
Consultant shall be on a quarterly basis. The MPWD shall be responsible for preparing targets
for each of the identified EMP activities. All subsequent reporting by the contractor shall be
monitored as per these targets set by the MPWVD before the contractors move on to the site. The
reporting by the Contractor will be monthly report like report of progress on construction and+ill
form the basis for monitoring by the MPWD, either by its own Environmental cell or lte
Environmental Specialist hired by the Supervision Consultant.
Along with these reports, NGO shall report progress of plantation and survival rate as per the
monitoring plan. Table 4.2 summarises the monitoring and reporting arrangements. Individual
formats are given in Annexure 4.3.

CHAPTER 5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT BUDGET
The environmental budget for the various environmental management measures proposed in the
EMP is detailed in Table 5.1. There are several other environmental issues that have been
addressed as part of good engineering practices, the costs for which has been accounted for in
the Engineering Cost. Various environmental aspects covered under engineering costs are listed
below:
i.     Turfing and Pitching of slopes
ii.    Construction of slope protection works as retaining walls, breast walls toe walls, band
drains, and gabions.
iii.   Construction of roadside amenities as bus stops, public urinals etc.
Costs of mitigation measures specified in the EMP covered under heads other than those in
Table 5.1 are given as under:
i.     Construction of water harvesting structures to meet the water requirements of
construction shall be borne by the contractor
ii.    Costs of relocation of Common prop'erty Resources are covered in R&IPDP budg*
Explanations  of the  rates  adopted  for estimation  of the  budget are  given  in
Annexure 5.1

Environmental Management Plan for Pt B: Annexures
Mizoram State Roads Project. Phase-It
Annexure 2.8         Rehabilitation plan for borrow      pits
*  The objective of the rehabilitation programme is to return the borrow pit sites to a safe and secure
area, which the general public should be able to safely enter and enjoy. Securing borrow pits/quarry
sites in a stable condition should be a fundamental requirement of the rehabilitation process. This
could be achieved by filling the quarry / borrow pit floor to approximately the access road level.
*  It is important to plan restoration from the outset and coordinate restoration with quarrying activities.
In addition to the bio-diversity issues, land planning considerations are also taken into account
when defining a rehabilitation project in order both to preserve the environment and to generate
income for the local communities. In this framework quarry rehabilitation often leads to the creation
of wetlands and natural reserves or recreation areas.
*  Special quarry/borrow pit rehabilitation plan called 'landscape plan' should be specified according to
the location and shaping of the mining slopes after exploitation and overburdened dump, with
different subsequent uses e.g. forest, meadow, reserve for special and endangered species of
animals and plants, wetlands etc., the re-greening and replanting methods. This rehabilitation plan
with focus on bio-diversity should be worked out in-cooperation with nature protection experts.
Other criteria which should be followed for rehabilitation of quarry/borrow pits are as given below:
*  Quarries and borrow pits will be backfilled with rejected construction wastes and will be given a
vegetative cover. If this is not possible, then excavation slopes will be smoothed and depression will
be filled in such a way that it looks more or less like the original ground surface.
*  During works execution, the contractor shall ensure preservation of trees during piling of materials;
spreading of stripped material to facilitate water percolation and allow natural vegetation growth;
reestablishment of previous natural drainage flows; digging of ditches to collect runoff; and
maintenance of roadways where a pit or quarry is declared useable water source for livestock or
people nearby. Once the works are completed, and the contractor shall restore the environment
around the work site to its original status at his cost.
*  To create a safe environment under the terms of The Mines and Quarries Act the faces have to be
reduced to a naturally stable slope or be adequately fenced to prevent access to the top and bottom
of the faces. Such a fence must be of a height as prescribed under The Mines Act with a barbed
wire top strand designed to exclude the public from the quarry area. Depending on the location of
the site presence of a permanent lake is considered to be a satisfactory alternative to a fence.
*  Appropriate plant species have to be selected in consultation with ecological consultant. Depending
on the limitations on the availability of appropriate plant material, harsh growing conditions (lack of
irrigation and hot summer) and ongoing quarry rehabilitation operations there may be substantial
loss of plantation and the planting programme may have to be continued for over 3-5 years. As
plantings are progressively established they should be monitored before undertaking the next stage
to ensure maximum plant survival rates.
*  The quarry or boFrow pit immediate surroundings should be developed as a low maintenance
reserve, with significant areas of native trees and shrubs and areas of longer grass and tussocks
forming the open spaces. Walkways around the borrow site must be constructed. Provision for a
future drive-in picnic area and car parking area may be developed

Environmental Management Plan for P18: Annexures
Mizoram State Roads Project. Phase-Il
Annexure 2.9         Mitigation measures for slope stabilization
Control of Soil Erosion and Slope Stabilization
In order to stabilize the slopes, retaining walls (engineering structures able to resist bending, and with a
footing designed to withstand pressure at the base of the slope) shall be incorporated in the project design
at vulnerable locations.
Three types of design of retaining walls have been proposed to enhance th^ stability of slopes on the
hillside at different locations of the project road. These are:
*   RO1       Dry Random Rubble Masonry for Heights < = 2.0 m
*   R02       Composite Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > = 2.0 m but < = 5.0 m
*   R03       Mortared Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > 3.0 m but < = 6.0 m
Similarly to stabilize the slopes on the valley-side when it is required to widen the road by filling on the
valley-side breast walls will be provided at different locations of the project road. Depending on the4eight
of the cut to be supported and other site conditions, following types of Breast walls could be providbd at
different locations of the project road.
*   RO1       Dry Random Rubble Masonry for Heights < = 2.0 m
*   ROlg      Bamboo Crib walls/gabions for Heights <= 2.0 m
*   R02       Composite Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > = 2.0 m but < = 5.0 m
*   RO2g      Gabions for heights >2.0 m <=5.0 m
*   R03       Mortared Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > 5.0 m
Bioengineering Techniques for Soil Stabilization
Such measures include plantation of soil-binding plant species on the exposed surfaces resulting from
shoulder - cutting to widen the roads, as well as on the valley slope to further strengthen the soil-binding
there.
* Species Selection
Species have been selected keeping in mind the local availability, growth, pollution control and
bioengineering capabilities and invasiveness. Table 3.8.1 and Table 3.8.2 gives in details the floral species
recommended for bioengineering near settlements within 1 km of the last dwelling) and outside settlements.
Beside these recommended species, species like, Lycopodium spp., Selaginella spp., Polytrichum spp., and
Sphagnum spp., which are found widespread in the area, can be planted to stabilise the soil both on the
valley slope and road shoulders.

Annexure 2.14        Guidelines for rehabilitation of dumping sites
The dumpsites filled only upto the ground level could be rehabilitated as per guidelines below and to be
decided by the engineer and the supervision consultant
*  The dumpsites have to be suitably rehabilitated by planting local species of shrubs and other plants.
Local species of trees (e.g. bamboo etc.) has also to be planted so that the landscape is coherent
and is in harmony with its various components.
*  In cases where a dumpsite is near to the local village community settlements, it could be converted
into a play field by spreading the durrv, ,. aterial evenly on the ground. Such playground could be
made coherent with the landscape by planting trees all along the periphery of the playground.
*  Some of the dumpsites could be used either for plantation or for growing agricultural produce such
as ginger, turmeric or oranges etc.
*  Care should always be taken to maintain the hydrological flow in the area.

MIZORAM STATE ROADS PROJECT
Services of NGO/CBO for Roadside Plantation along Phase II Roads
|ERMS OF REFERENCg
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Government of Mizoram is seeking a World Bank loan (WB Loan no. 4114 IN) available with the
Government of India, for upgradation and maintenance of the state road network. The project envisages
major augmentation of capacity and structural quality of the road network in the state of Mizoram. The
project preparation activities including the project planning and design is be,ing carried out by the PWD,
Government of Mizoram (PWD), through project coordinating consultants (PCC). The corridors that
have been identified for improvement in two phases of the project are listed in Table 1.1. Improvements
to these roads consist mainly of, strengthening, widening, and minor realignments.
Table 1.1: Project Roads

The project proposes to acquire 5m strip of land from the existing edge of pavement on both sides of
the Phase- II project road. The acquisition of land within the settlement stretches has been avoided to
the maximum extent possible in order to minimise disruption under the project. For accommodating the
intermediate lane cross-section suggested would require 7.1m on an average. Thus sufficient space
would be available within the PWD land. The project proposes to utilise this space for roadside
plantation not only from the enhancement purposes but also to protect the PWD land from being put to
other uses. The MPWD requires NGOs/CBOs services for carrying out roadside plantation. MPWD now
invites the services of eligible NGOs/CBOs under quality based lump sum contracts.
2. TASKS OF THE NGO/CBO
The assignment shall be carried out by the NGO/CBO under the following task heads
*    Identification of the plantation stretches along with PWD
* Preparation of nurs,eries
*   Planting of saplings and
*   Maintenance for three years

3.2.2. Digging of Pits
Tree pits shall be dug a minimum of three weeks prior to backfilling. The pits shall be 120cms in
diameter and 120cms deep. While digging the pits, the topsoil up to a depth of 30cms may be kept
aside, if found good (depending upon site conditions), and mixed with the rest of the soil.
If the side of the below, it shall be replaced with the soil mixture as specified further herein. If the soil is
normal it shall be mixed with manure; river sand shall be added to the soil if it is heavy.
The bottom of the pit shall be forked to break up the subsoil.
3.2.3. Back Filling
The soil back filled watered through end gently pressed down, a day previous to planting, to make sure
that it may not further settle down after planting. The soil shall be pressed down firmly by treading it
down, leaving a shallow depression all round for watering..
3.2.4. Planting
No tree pits shall be dug until final tree position has been pegged out for approval.
Care shall be taken that the plant sapling when planted is not be buried deeper than in the nursery, or in
the pot.
Planting should not be carried out in waterlogged soil.
Plant trees at the original soil depth; soil marks on the stem is an indication of this and should be
maintained on the finished level, allowing for setting of the soil after planting. All plastic andsther
imperishable containers should be removed before planting. Any broken or damage roots should bq cut
back to sound growth.
The bottom of the planting pit should be covered with 50mm to 75mm of soil. Bare roots should be
spread evenly in the planting pit; and small mound in the centre of the pits on which the roots are placed
will aid on even spread. Soil should be placed around the roots, gently shaking the tree to allow the soil
particles to shift into the root system to ensure close contact with all roots and prevent air pockets Back
fill soil should be firmed as filling proceeds, layer by layer, care being taken to avoid damaging the roots,
as follows:
The balance earth shall be filled in a mixture of 1:3 (1 part sludge to 3 part earth by volume) and 50gms
potash, (Mop) 50gms of Super Phosphate and 1 Kg. Neem oil cake. Aldrin or equivalent shall be
applied every 15 days in a mixture of 5ml in 5 litres of water.
3.2.5. Staking
Newly planted trees must be held firmly although not rigidly by staking to prevent a pocket forming
around the stem and newly formed fibrous roots being broken by mechanical pulling as the tree rocks.
The main methods of staking shall be:
*    A single vertical shake, 900mm longer than the clear stem of the tree, driven 600mm to
900mm into the soil.
*    Two stakes as above driven firmly on either side of the tree with a cross bar to which the stem
is attached. Suitable for bare- rooted or Ball material.
A single stake driven in at an angle at 45 degrees and leaning towards the prevailing wind,
the stem just below the lowest branch being attached to the stake. Suitable for small bare-
rooted or Ball material
For plant material 3m to 4.5m high with a single stem a three- wire adjustable guy system
may be used in exposed situations.
The end of stake should be pointed and the lower 1 m to 1.2m should be coated with a non-injurious
wood preservative allowing at least 150mm above ground level.
3.2.6. Tying
Each tree should be firmly secured to the stake so as to prevent excessive mnvement. Abrasion must
be avoided by using a buffer, rubber or Hessian, between the tree and stake. The tree should be
secured at a point just below its lowest branch, and also just above ground level: normally two ties
should be used for tree. These should be adjusted.or replaced to allow for growth.
3.2.7. Watering

after planting and he shall during the following growing season, keep the plant material well watered
3.2.8. Fertilising
Fertilising shall be carried out by application in rotation of the following fertilisers, every 15 days from
the beginning of the monsoon till the end of winter:
1. Sludge or organic well-rotted dry farm yard manure: 0.05 cum or tussle.
2. Urea 25gm.
3. Ammonium sulphate 25gm.
4. Potassium sulphate 25gm.
All shrubs, which are supplied pot grown, shall be well soaked prior to planting.
Watering in and subsequent frequent watering of summer planted container- grown plants is essential.
3.3.   Shrub Planting In Planter Beds
*  All areas to be planted with shrubs shall be excavated, trenched to a depth of 750mm, refilling
the excavated earth after breaking clods and mixing with sludge in ratio 8:1 (8 parts of stacked
volume of earth after reduction by 20%: 1 part of stacked volume of sludge after reduction by
8%.)
*  Tall shrubs may need staking, which shall be,provided if approved by the Contracting-conslting
engineer, depending upon the conditions of individual plant specimen.
*   For planting shrubs and ground cover shrubs in planters, good earth shall be mixed with slydge
in the proportion as above and filled in planters.
Positions of planters shall be planted should be marked out in accordance with the Design drawings. When
shrubs are set out, precautions should be taken to prevent roots drying. Planting holes 40cm diameter and
40cm deep should be excavated for longer shrubs. Polythene and other non-perishable containers should
be removed and any badly damaged roots carefully pruned. The shrubs should then be set in holes so that
the soil level after settlement will be original soil mark on the stem of the shrub. The holes should be back
filled to half of its depth and firmed by treading. The remainder of the soil can then be returned and again
firmed by treading.

The grass roots stock received at site shall be manually cleared of all weeds and water sprayed over the
same after keeping the stock in place protected from sun and dry winds.
Grass stock received at site may be stored for a maximum of three days. In case grassing for some areas is
scheduled for a later date fresh stock of grass roots shall be ordered and obtained.
3.4.4. Execution
Small roots shall be dibbled about 5cms apart into the prepared grounds. Grass-will only be accepted as
reaching practical completion when germination has proved satisfactory and all weeds have been removed.
3.4.5. Maintenance
As soon as the grass is approximately a 3cm high it shall be rolled with a light wooden roller in fine, dry
weather and when it has grown to 5 to 8cms, above to ground weeds must be removed and regular cutting
withi the scythe and rolling must be begun. A top-dressing of an ounce of guano to the square yard e"r well

As part of the project implementation, the MSRP plans to undertake plantation and maintenance and
protection of the vegetation along the project roads (in addition to the compensatory afforestation that has
been proposed by the Forest Department, Government of Mizoram). The maintenance of these plantations
would be entrusted to an NGO. The environmental responsibilities of the NGO include the maintenance of
roadside plantations and conservation of biodiversity. The specific roles and responsibilities of the NGO
include:
*  Provide, plant and maintain three year old saplings on the valley side along the free lands and
unclassified forestlands along the project road and along either sides of the road in sections through
non-hilly terrain. Indigenous species would be selected for plantation, and maintained for five years,
including protection and monitoring of the survival.
*   Undertake adequate measures to ensure maximum survival of the saplings during transportation to the
site, and post plantation by proper handling and mairlenance.
*   Ensure proper watering, removal of weed, litter and debris from the vicinity of the plantation. The VGO
will ensure the protection of the fencing provided to the saplings from trampling and browsing b4 the
cattle.
*   Identify locations of medicinal plants and other endangered plant species, and create awareness
amongst the population, the importance of the conservation of the same.
*   Periodically visit the construction activities in the Important Biological Areas identified along the corridor
and ensure that the construction activities are taken with due precautionary arrangements. In case of
any non-compliance, will report to the Environmental Engineer of the PIU and the Environmental
Specialist of the Supervision consultant for further action
*   Will depute 4 personnel (preferably graduates) to undergo training by the Environmental Specialist of
the SC, or for participation in other income generation programmes as Orchid cultivation, creation of
gene pools for medicinal plants etc. These trained personnel will in turn carry out training in each of the
project villages, in co-ordination with the Village Councils.

Mizoram State Roads Project. Phase-t1
Annexure 4.1
Mizoram State Road Project Phase - II
Biodiversity Monitoring
Terms of Reference
(DRAFT June 2003)
1. Background
implementation of MSRP Phase - II by the Mizoram PWD involves widening of the road
from Buangpui - Lunglei to intermediate lane from the existing single lane configuration.
The pavement width will be 7.1m along the. corridor and 8m incase of curves. Thit
involves acquisition of land and clearance of vegetation in the area acquired.
Management of adjoining lands in this forested region is of prime importance in order to,
maintain ecological integrity, including biodiversity. Therefore, the monitoring of
biodiversity is required to assess the success of such management.
2. Program Goal
The goal of the Biodiversity Monitoring Program is to detect changes in biodiversity that
may be caused by human activities along the corridor particularly, movement of traffic
and increased access to the region.
3. Supporting Principles
1. Monitoring will occur in both aquatic and terrestrial systems; an integrated
approach is preferred.
2. Monitoring will occur in locations having a wide range of land use histories,
including those with limited human influence (i.e., reference areas).
3. Estimates of natural variability will be obtained and used to assist interpretations
of the significance of observed changes.
4. The development and implementation of this monitoring program will be
transparent and subject to rigorous technical review.
4. Guidelines for Monitoring
4.1 Scope:
The consultant should carry out monitoring of both terrestrial and aquatic environment.
The locations chosen shall be representative of specific landuses and the sample size
should be selected to cover all the typical landuse/terrain of the prdject corridor. The
consultant shall carry out monitoring with his own instrumentation and equipment.

Mizoram State Roads Project. Phase-l1
4.2 Methodology:
4.2.1 Terrestrial Ecology
The species-richness as well as the densities of Trees and ground flora is to be
estimated. Tree and shrub densities are to be estimated using the line transact method
with each longitudinal traverse of atleast 100m, and 10 replicate samples were to be
taken in each section. Besides, the indirect influence area of the corridor, especially the
valley slope and floor is to be searched for presence of any rare species of pla.-t.
Besides species-richness and density component, the diversity of the plant communities
is also to be measured. Species diversity index should be ,measured using the
Menhinick's diversity index, Shannon-Wiener Index and uniformity shall be estimated
using relative frequency.
4.2.2 Aquatic Ecology
Random experimental fishing is to be adopted for sampling in both upstream and
downstream of Road Bridge along the river. Sampling net should have a minimum size
of 152 x 900 cm and should have an aperture sizes of atleast 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Random
sampling for is to be carried out for a period of one week. In addition, water sampling is
to be carried out to know the physio-chemical characteristics of water of the study area.
5. Timeframe For Services
The monitoring is to be conducted quarterly for the whole period of construction i.e., for
3years.
6. Reporting
Quarterly monitoring conducted should be reported to the client and supervision
consultant within 15 days of completion of site visit. A report with the analysis of
quarterly monitoring is to be submitted at the end of each year. The report should
include but not limited to the all the statistical analysis of diversity, abundance and
density, impacts occurred due to construction and measures that would need to be
taken. It should also include the efficacy of measures carried out and the compliance in
implementation of the measures required.

need to be revegetated to improve the soil binding property of the slopes and increase
stability.
2. Program Goal
The goal of the Bio-engineering Monitoring Program is to monitor the progress of
plantation as well as the survival and effectiveness of the scheme.
3. Supporting Principles
1. Monitoring will occur in stages of plantation and maintenance.
2. Monitoring will occur in all locations where the measures are in progress
3. Estimates of effectiveness of the measures based on natural variability will be
obtained
4. Scope:
The consultant should carry out monitoring during plantation of the species as well as
during survival and maintenance. All the locations where bio-engineering measures are
being implemented have to be monitored. Along with the plantation and survival
monitoring, topographic and soil properties by visual observation shall be collected. The
consultant shall carry out monitoring with his own instrumentatiorf and equipment.
5. Timeframe For Services
The monitoring is to be conducted quarterly for the whole period of plantation (about
6months) and upto 3 years after plantation (during maintenance).

6. Guidelines
*  The monitoring is to be conducted quarterly at all sites selected for
implementation of bio-engineering measures.
* The technique adopted shall be subjected to scrutiny by the consultant in the
initial stages and any changes required shall be intimated to the PIU. Final
technique to be adopted shall be worked out in consultation with the PIU.
*  Species selec.tpri should have good soil binding properties, have firm rooting,
should not be invasive, should not be water demanding and should be available
in abundance
*  Consultations have to be carried out in the villages to 'intimate them of the
measures being undertaken, requirement of species and their availability in the
region in abundance
*  Plantation should be undertaken in the wet season to ensure maximum rate a*
survival
7. Reporting
Quarterly monitoring conducted should be reported to the client and supervision
consultant within 15 days of completion of site visit. A report with the analysis of
quarterly monitoring is to be submitted at the end of each year. The report should
include but not limited to species planted, techniques used, survival rate of the
vegetation planted and recommendations for further improvement of slope stability. It
should also include the efficacy of measures carried out and the compliance in
implementation of the measures required.
