1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. OVERVIEW
The Mizoram State Roads Project (MSRP) is being prepared and implemented by the
Mizoram Public Works Department (MPWD) with World Bank (WB) assistance. Phase I
of the project is under construction following appraisal by the Bank in 2002. The
project preparation for Phase ll is underwoy since late 2001. A consortium', acting as
Project Co-ordinating Consultants (PCC), is assisting the MPWD during project
preparation. Their inputs will continue (in limited capocities) throughout the project
duration. In addition, MPWD will also hire the services of a Construction Supervision
Consultant as the Engineer for the implementation along similar lines as Phase 1. Like
all Category 'A' transport projects funded by the World Bank, MSRP is subject to an
Independent Environmental Review2. This Environmental Impact Assessment and its
companion reports, covering the activities to be carried out in Phase 11, have been
scrutinized during the IER. These reports are now updated addressing the observations
made during the Review.
1.2.  PHASE li ACTIVITIES IN MSRP
Phase 11 of MSRP endeavours to complete the enhanced connectivity of two of the
most important cities in Mizoram - Aizawl and Lunglei, initiated in Phase 1. The
Upgradation of the MPWD's old Aizawl - Lunglei road will reduce the distance traffic
has to travel by 65km when compared to NH 54. A new alignment bypassing Aizawl
city from the east will connect NH 54 near Zemabawk to the state highway near Km
4.5. In addition, 230 km of existing state highways will also undergo major
maintenance. Table 1.1 summarises the works to be undertaken during Phase lIof
MSRP. These routes are also shown in Figure 1.1.
This report relates to the assessment of impacts on the Upgradation along PIS route. It
is built on the work done during Phase 1, which included a Sectoral Environmental
Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment for the P1A stretch. A stand-alone
Environmental Management Plan is prepared to facilitate implementation of
environmental manogement measures. AizawI bypass (BP 1) is studied separately and
a combined EIA-cum-EMP is prepared. The socio-economic impacts of all activities
I The PCC consortium comprised M/s. Intercontinentai Consultants and Technocrats (I) Ltd. (ICT) and M/s. Consulting
Engineering Services Pvt. Ltd. (CES).
2 M/s. LEA Associates South Asia Pvt. Ltd. (LASA) were selected as the Independent Reviewers with the responsibilities of
updating tee documents in light of the observations.

included in the upgradation component, for PI5 and BPI, are analysed and a single
Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan (R&IPDP) is prepared.
Management of environmental and social aspects for all routes covered in the major
maintenance programme are addressed in Environmental and Resettlement
Management Plan.
1.3.   PROPOSED WORKS UNDER UPGRADATION COMPONENT
Activities under the Upgradation component are geared to widen the road along the
existing blignment for most of the stretch to intermediate lane standards (5.5m) with
side drains and shoulders. Most of the widening will be affected by cutting on the
hillside, with only short realignments to smoothen curves on the valley side. New
culverts and bridges are to be constructed including one major bridge across
Mizoram's longest river, the Tlawng. Adequate slope protection works are included in
design and the pavement is being rebuilt to structurally sound designs. Adequate
provision is mcde for road signs and other road furniture. Figure 1.2 shows the typical
cross-section of the finished road for straight sections. Along curves, instead of 7.1m
wide section along straight portions, the bench would be slightly wider at 8.0m.

1.4. IMPACTS ENVISAGED DUE TO THE PROJECT
The beneficial impacts of the project, including the Upgradation component have
been detailed out as part of the project justification. To summarise, these are:
8 Shortening distance between Aizawl and Lunglei. It will result in reduced fuel
consumption, vehicle operating costs improving competitiveness and market access
for forest and agro products.
0 improved connectivity for the settlements along PI.
Building rood to improved standards will result in safee and more informned travel.
8 Better drainage of the road and adjoining areas which can also reduce the chances
of erosion and landslides.
Provision for roadside amenities such as passenger sheds and toilets
o Generation of employment directly in terms of road & allied construction activities and
indirectly due to socio-economic and commercial development that is expected to
follow.
However, the focus of this impact analysis is on the adverse impacts of the project on
various components of the environment with a view to develop effective mitigation
and management measures. It is also to provide inputs to the highway design team
on avoidance, compensation and/or enhancement measures for incorporation into
design. mome of the impacts associated with the project are:
a On the stability of slopes-both above and below the road section
a Habitats (if any) of important species in the area
a Use and storage of water to be used in construction and
e Sensitive receptors located along the alignment being improved under the project
Due to the low volumes of present and anticipated traffic the impacts on the quality
of air, noise and woter environment are expected to be relatively insignificant.io
Mitigation measures commensurate with the anticipated impacts have been worked
out during project preparation. The process followed for this endeavour is described in
drigin. Document oty ICT & CES    1-4

a later section of this chapter. Adoption of these measures as part of the project will
ensure that the residual impacts are within the acceptable range.
1.5.  STUDY METHODOLOGY
The study is built on the SEA carried out for the entire project, where the important
environmental issues were identified. Major activities of the study are concisely
described in this section. The collection, assembly and analysis of data from primary
and secondary sources hove followed the methodology develc;ed during the EA
review and updations for Phase I. Detailed procedures for individual components are
given later in this section.
The inferences drawn have included specialist inputs such as floral diversity and slope
stability assessments. Public Consultations were carried out to ascertain public opinion
regarding the improvements and to provide the roadside communities with advance
information regarding the project. Analysis of alternatives considered has been
constrained by an earlier decision to improve the existing alignment, remote location
of the project site, and the difficult terrain. Mitigation measures developed during the
study are incorporcted in the design drawings and/or Bills of Quantities as
appropriate. For severcl items, which would not be executed by the Civil Works
contractor, separate arrangements have been worked out. Budgetary allocations are
made for all the environmental mitigation and enhancement measures.
Implementation arrangements including responsibilities of all the actors are
streamlined and documented for future guidance.
1.5.1. Air & Water
The air quality data and water quality data was collected by the PCC and Mizoram
Pollution Control Board as part of the project preparation. The procedures prescribed
by the CPCB were followed for the pollutants of concern.
1.5.2. Noise
The noise levels were recorded at four different locations using a hand-held noise
meter during the study. Sampling locations selected were representative of the
various rand-uses along the PIB - Sensitive, Residential and Commercial, as per the
classification used in the national standards.
1.5.3. Natural Habitats
A tree survey has been carried out for the entire PIB route where trees of girth size
over 30cm were enumerated. A floral diversity assessment has been carried out for
the entire stretch during project preparation. As part of the review, an additional
study was carried out within the designated Riverine Reserve, during which in addition
to the floral diversity, fish species in the River Tlawng was also studied.

3. THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT
This chapter presents the baseline information on the biophysical environment and
socio-economic conditions. Information on the environmental components was
generated by primary surveys conducted during project preparation and independent
review, interactions at various levels with local people and other stakeholders like
officials of the Forests Department. The socio-economic profile has been distilled from
the R&IPDP.
3.1.  THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
3. 1.1. Meteorological Conditions
The climate is generally pleasant with summer temperatures ranging between 180C to
320C and winter temperatures between 80C to 240C. The seasonal cycle consists of four
seasons namely summer, spring, autumn and winter. The average annual rainfall
recorded is 2371 mm. However, annual rainfall varies from 2000mm - 3500mm. Relative
humidity in the dry season is 40% while in the monsoon period, it is about 90%.
3.1.2. Land
Geology And Soil
The common rocks found are sandstone, limestone, silt stone, slates and shale. The rock
system is weak and unstable, prone to frequent seismic influence. The terrain seems
entirely immature with regard to recent structural /geological changes in earth's crust.
In general, the geomorphology of the Mizoram State Roads Project - Phase 11 area is
charocterized by the presence of weathering products of typical varying thickness on
original hilltops. The geo-morphological formations consist of steep hill slopes and deep
valleys oriented on the topographic surface in a linear fashion. The presence of valleys
and ravines show physiographic expressions of the faults or structural patterns, giving
origin to different types of drainage patterns. Faulting has resulted in creation of steep
faulty curves, highly dissected ranges with deep ravines, spurs etc. vulnerable to
comprehensive erosion. The rocks are fractured and hence susceptible to failure during
monsoon resulting in landslides.
Soils vary from sandy loom, clayey loam to clay, generally mature but leached due to
steep gradient and heavy rainfall. Soils are porous with poor water holding capacity.
deficit in potash. phosphorous, nitrogen and humus and hence poor in productivity.
The pHshows acidic to neutral reaction due to excessive leaching.
The subject stretch is an old road bench and is perceptibly in a stabilised state. Some
sporadic distress points viz. road cuts exhibiting mini to macro collapses on both uphill &
downhill faces and quite steep slope at locations are observed. However, these do not
look to be immediately vulnerable.

Mostly the derived products as observed in this stretch being cohesive, exhibit coherent
faces and generally stable for the exposed heights, despite high silt content. In the
above general and local scenario, this route length may be considered as it is, in a
better status compared to the stretch under P i A. The recee4 notes on the project road
is appended in the Annexure 3.1.
Topography
The entire territory of Mizoram is mostly mountainous and hilly with precipitous slopes
forming deep gorges culminating into several streams and rivers. Almost all the hill
ranges traverse in the North-South direction. Phawngpui or Blue Mountain is the highest
peak at 2157 m whereas the lowest place is Bairabi at 40 m above Mean Sea Level
(MSL). The average height of hill ranges in Mizoram is 920 m.
The project road passes through hilly terrain with alternate steep slopes and deep
valleys with gorges.
Land Slides
The terrain with fractured rock having unstable steep slopes is further weakened by
heavy rain during the monsoon season resulting in landslides. Deforestation by felling of
trees for timber, animal fodder requirements, removal of vegetation cover by slash and
burn technique for agricultural needs are other factors for destabilization of slopes
resulting in landslides. The landslide locations identified for Buangpui - Lunglei Road
Phase-Il are given in Table 3.1 below. Prominent landslides at Km 140.725 and Km
141.340 are depicted in Figure 3.1

Borrow Pits / Areas
Excess cut material produced from cutting the hillside can be used as fill where
required. No additional borrow areas may be need to be opened along the entire
stretch. Samples of sand from different riverbeds on testing, was found that this
contained considerable amount of pebbles and gravels, which does not make it
suitable for road construction. Also, the transportation cost of river sand from valleys at
lower levels to the high levels, where road construction will take place, will be high.
Hence, as an alternative to sand, it is proposed to use dust from sione crushers as a
binder material for road construction. It can also be utilized for blending with sub-base
and base course granular material.
3.1.3. Water Resources
In Mizoram, major surface water sources are rivers running at the bottom of the valleys
and mountain streams. Few stagnant water bodies like ponds created for human use
have also been recorded along P1B. Due to the steep slope and the soil conditions,
little infiltration takes place and the ground water levels are relc'ively deep. However,
the quality of water is quite pristine in most locations due to absence of major sources
of pollution.
Surface Water and Cross Drainage Channels
There are three ponds, eight waterfalls, one marshy area and one river along the
Buangpui - Lunglei Rood. Out of the three ponds, the pond at Km 102.380 is a fishpond;
the pond at Km 128.060 is a pond used for watering within a nursery and the pond at
Km 128.120 is another private pond. A complete list of water bodies present in the
project corridor is in Table 3.3. Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 shows location of ponds and
waterfalls respectively.

Cross-drainage Channels/Work
There are 217 culverts to convey water flowing in minor streams and accumulating on
the hillside during monsoon across the existing rood. However, the drainage is not
adequate as sheet flow over the formation during monsoon exists. Some of the existing
culverts are clogged by ubposition of soil and growth of vegetation while some are
damaged due to the excessive flow and rocks and debris flowing down with it. Details
of the culverts, both existing and proposed are given in the engineering design
* Tlawng River Bridge
Currently, a 45 m long steel bridge is available to cross the River Tlawng at Km 150.300.
It is a complete steel structure with a narrow deck made out of steel plates and can
allow traffic in one direction at a time. The water flow below it is unhindered since there
are no piers within or outside the waterway.
Ground Water and Water Harvesting
The ground water potential in the Mizoram State is on the whole very low. On hilltops
where most of the population lives, there is acute shortage of drinking water. The PHE
department traps water from streams for piped water supply to some settlements.
Hand pumps are dug at a number of locations along the corridor. However, these are,
seasonal in nature and provide water mainly during rainy secson when the water table
is relatively high.

Marshy Area
A marshy area has been identified along the priority road PIB near Km 100.160.
(Buangpui - S.Kanghmun). This land supports predominantly hydrophytes and is a
breeding ground for dragonfly and other amphibians. This marshy area is about 100 m
away from the road alignment.
3.1.4. Air Quality
The air quality in state of Mizoram is generally pristine. This is expected because
Mizoram is an industrially backward state and has lush green vegetation. Volume of
the traffic on the roads is low and hence the pollutant concentration close to the roads
is quite low.
Air quality data measurements taken along Buangpui - Lunglei road are given in the
Table 3.5. While the values of 502 and CO are below detectable limits, the values of
NOx are within the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The high values
of SPM in case of Lunglei market could be accounted for the temporary roadside works
being undertaken during sampling.

* Forest Resources
Mizoram has a large area under forest cover: over 80% of the state, admeasuring
18,388 sq. km. and is under dense, open or scrub type of forest. However, the forests
are under increasing      stress, due   to increasing   area   under Jhum     (slash and   burn
agricultural practice which follows a 5 to 8 year cycle) and increased area under
plantations. The forests are classified as Protected areas, Reserve Forests, Protected
Forests and Unclassified forests. None of the currently notified 7 Protected Areas
(totalling 840.75 sq. km) are located adjacent to the proposed alignment. The project
route passes through Reserve forests as described below.
a Riverine Reserve forest
The reserve forest of Tlawng was declared by the erstwhile Mizo District Council and
notified in the Gazette of Assam on May 19, 1965. The notification covers 800m on
either side of several rivers, including the Tlawng. PWD has obtained permission for
diversion of Forest Department land from the Regional Chief Conservator of Forests'

In early 2002, the Forest Department, Government of Mizoram, has notified its intention
to declare the Saza hill and the adjoining area, along the project road on the Pukpui
side; and the Tlawng River as a bird sanctuary with an area of 15 sq. km. Thus, project
road PI B forms the western boundory of this proposed Saza-Tlawng sanctuary for a
Leq is defined as the hypothetical steady-state sound level that contains the same amount of acoustical energy as the actual
time-varying sound over a specified time interval. The day time is reckoned in between 6 AM to 10 PM while night time is
reckoned in between 10 AM to 6 AM.

length of just over 7km. For very short stretches, less than I km in length over several
locations, widening on the hillside will require land within the area proposed to be
included within the sanctuary. A copy of the notification is appended to the report as
Annexure 3.2. This proposal has been sent to the District Commissioner, Lunglei (an
official of the Revenue Deportment) for further processing and is open for suggestions
from general public9. Government of Mizoram has already notified 5m wide strip on
both sides of several important roads in the state including P1 (Aizawl - Lunglei). Figure
3.5 shows the current location of the proposed sanctuary and riverine reserve in
relation to the project corridor.

Due to strengthening and widening of the Buangpui - Lunglei Road, a number of trees
and plants are likely to the uprooted. Trees of different species having girth more than
30cm within 15 m of the existing bench were counted and tree inventory was
prepared. Table 3.7 summarises the girth-wise distribution of the trees. Details including
species are provided in Annexure 3.3.

Discussions with a senior Forest Department Official, during the site visit to Lunglei for the Independent Review have revealed
that there is strong opposition from the locals to the proposal. Some moves are afoot to change the location to the other side of
the river. However, there is no documentation available in this regard.

longitudinal traverse of lOOm, and        10 replicate samples were taken in each section.
Besides, the valley slope and floor were scanned with a powerful binocular to note the
presence of any rare species of plant.
Besides species-richness and density component, the diversity of the plant communities
was also measured. Species diversity index was measured using the Menhinick's
diversity index, and uniformity with relative frequency using the following formulae:
D =-
Where D= Menhinick's diversity index, S= Number of species and N=Number of
individuals.
Uniformity was estimated as:
Number of point of occurrences of a species
R. F.     -    Total number of points taken for all species              X 100, where R.F. is
relative frequency
The   Diversity was    also  measured      using  the   Shannon-Wiener Diversity       Index   and
calculated using the following formulae:
Shannon-Wiener Index of Diversity, H = -E pi log pi
Where,                 pi = ni/N,      ni = number of individuals of the ith species,
N = total number of individuals of all the species
The   indices   were   employed      to  get a    comprehensive, easily       comparable, and
quantitative estimate of the diversity of the plant community.

0   Riparian Flora
An extensive biodiversity assessment on the riparian ecology of the river Tlawng near
150.300km is conducted as port of updation of reports. This survey was done as the
area around Tlawng has been declared as Riverine Reserve Forest (discussed in the
preceding sections). The forests around the river Tlawng can be mainly classified as
tropical moist deciduous forest type. These forests are heavily degraded as a result of
shifting cultivation; secondary forests have been regenerated in the form of extensive
bamboo bushes. The dense or climax forests are quite far away from the riverine
reserve area of Tlawng. The forests along the slopes are mainly seral in nature and
dominated by bamboo.
Methodology adopted
The species as well as the densities, frequency and abundance of herbs and shrubs
were estimated randomly with the help of 2m2 least-count quadrate with 30 replicate
samples in the project area. Tree densities, frequency and abundance were also
estimated using the line transect method, with each longitudinal traverse measuring a
distance of I OOm in which 20 replicate samples were taken randomly in the study area.-
Inventory of floral diversity Assessment along River Tlawng
A total number of 35 species of herbs and shrubs and 26 species of trees were found in
the adjoining area of the riverbanks. The riparian vegetation was composed mainly of
Ageretum    conyzoides, Saccharum      sp., Cynodon dactylon, Mikonia micrantha and
Imperata cylindrico species. The highest Menhinick's index of 0.26 was shown by
Melocanna     baccifera   and  Mikonia microntha. The total Menhinick's index and
Shannon-Weiner Index as shown by the herbs and shrubs are 0.91 and 2.91
respectively. Similarly for trees the total Menhinick's index and Shannon-Weiner Index
are 2.32 and 2.86 respectively. The species list along with the density abundances and
indices are shown in Annexure 3.21. No endangered or rare species were reported
during the survey.

* Rare and Endangered Plant Species
During biodiversity survey along the Buangpui-Lunglei road, endangered tree fern
(Cyothea spp) was found at a number of locations all throughout the project corridor.
These locations are 110.140 (S. Kanghmun - Ramlaitui), 111.680, 111.900, 112.680,
115.700, 117.420 (Ramlaitui - Sekhum), 134.206, (Haulawng - Mausen), 138.020, 139.860,
140.020, 1 40.040, 140,300, 140.455, 142.100, and 151.320 (Mausen - Lunglei). This tree fern
despite being included as endangered species by the IUCN is found everywhere in the
Jtr--e of Mizoram and may not be threatened by the road construction. Figure R.6
shows photograph of the Cyathea spp. taken on National Highway 54. Other than
Cyothea spp.. Vanda coeruleo has been located at chainage 111.320 and proper
measures are to be taken to protect the orchid.

* Important Biodiversity Areas
The biodiversity survey identified Important Biodiversity Area based upon the condition
of the existing ecosystem and the biodiversity indices. The reasons for choosing these
areas as IBA are:
> The biodiversity indices are the highest, therein suggesting the existence of greater
diversity of species.
> The existence of endangered species viz. Cyothec spp. in large numbers.
A The existence of the Riverine reserve forest of Tlawng.
' The proposed Sozo-Tlowng Bird Sanctuary is located in the area.
These areas are to be protected from unauthorised disposal of debris (other than at
sites identified and listed in Table no. 6.7and 6.9.) and other activities. These iBAs are

MizorOm State Roads Project Phase-l1
EIA for PI 8, June 2003
. Mammals
The project corridor forms the western boundary of the proposed Saza-Tlawng
Sanctuary, which is supposed to house endangered species like the Sozo (Capricornis
sumotroensis), Leopard (Panthera sp.) slow loris, Chinese pangolin (Manis
pentodactyla), hoolock gibbon, etc., besides a host of other mammalian species. But
during the survey no rare or endangered mammalian species were noticed and
reported in the project area.
3.2.2. Aquatic ecology
Flora
During the biodiversity survey, Green algae (Chlorophyta) like Ulothrix spp. and
Fontinolis spp. were identified among the phytoplankton. No aquatic plant species,
which are endangered, threatened or rore, were reported during the period of the
survey.
Fauna
e Fish survey on the River Tlawng
The fish survey on the river Tlawng was done as port of assessing the biodiversity in the
declared Riverine Reserve Forest. The objective of the survey was to identify the
possible negative impacts of the construction of the bridge and widening of the PIB
within the Reserve forest on the fish species, identify existence of rare or endangered
species, if any within the study area and to draw inference on the condition of the
aquatic ecosystem. Photographs of the flora and faunal survey on the river Tlawng are
given in Figure 3.7.
Methodology adopted for fish sampling:
Random experimental fishing was done in the lotic water of Tlawng by local made
fishing net of 152 x 900 cm. at upstream and downstream of the proposed construction
site of bridge for a period of one week. The sizes of the aperture of the local nets that
had been used were 1.0 x 1.0 cm, 11/2 x 11/2 cm and 3.0 x 3.0 cm respectively.
Altogether, 6 stations were made for random sampling for a period of one week and of
which percentage; average weight and size of each species were determined from
the total number of collected specimens. In addition, water sampling was also done to
know the physio-chemical characteristics of water of the study area. The average
depth of Tlawng River is 98cm, while 196cm was recorded as deepest.
Inventory of floral diversity Assessment along River Tlawng
During the ichthyological survey only three species of fish could be found and
collected, viz, Puntius ticto, Amblypharyngodon mola and Channa striotus. The
presence of some species like, Mastacembelus armatus, Barbus tor tor, Chonna

orientalis, Xenentodon concitl, Chondo manarays, Notopterus chitola, Noemacheilus
spp., Puntius filamentosus, Morcena thyroidoe, etc. were reported to be found by the
local fisher flock which generally reappear during rainy season. The fish species
identified are common and found all over the country. During the study, 52 fishes were
collected and Puntius ticto was the dominant species. Thus, the percentage, average
weight and size of each species were determined from the total number of collected
specimens. By mere observation, only fingerlings of Puntius ticto can be sighted at
different stations. Below is a fish sampling data sheet.

The survey didn't find any spawning grounds within the study area. On analysing the
fish sampling data, the collected specimens cannot be in any way categorized as
abundant, rare, threaten or endangered.
* Other Aquatic Fauna
Other than the fish species the ichthyological surveys identified Larva and adults of
various benthic micro invertebrates and large colonies of tadpoles during installation of
the nets. Calls of frogs were also heard during the night and evening. A number of
avian species (water fowls) e.g., Kingfisher were also identified by sighting and cails
during installing the nets.

4. COMMUNITY CONSULTATION
Extensive Community Consultation has been taken up during the Environmental and
Social Assessment for MSRP. Building on the phase I feedback on the documentation
aspects of consultation sessions, increased attention on recording the information
generated during the Phase II sessions has led to substantial inputs into the project
preparation - including influencing design. This chapter documents the issues that are
close to the community. their aspirations and their addressal by the project. Information
source for the chapter has been the similar documentation as part of the R&IPDP, with
the social team conducting these sessions.
A three-stage consultation process has been followed in the project. The first two
stages of consultation with the people have already been carried out during the pre-
design stage and the post-design verification stage. The follow up consultation
program would be conducted during the implementation of the project by the NGOs.
The objectives of consultation sessions, the procedure adopted and the outputs of the
consultation conducted have been briefly described in the following sections.
4.1.  PRE-DESIGN CONSULTATION PROCESS
4.1. 1. Objective
The pre-design consultations were conducted by 'the PCC. Objectives of the
consultation were:
e Information dissemination on the Project;
a Identification of stakeholders in the project: and
0 Identification of issues of the stakeholders concerning the project.
4.1.2. The Process
Several tools for consultation were applied and the views, suggestions and the
concerns of the community with respect to the project were obtained. The following
paragraphs describe the consultation process in detail.
The consultation process established for the project employed a range of formal and
informal consultation tools including, in depth interview with key informants, village
meetings, workshops and door-to-door personal contacts. Consultation sessions were
held with:
e Heads of the households likely to be impacted;
o Members of the households likely to be impacted;
* Clusters of PAPs;
. Villagers:
e Village Council Presidents;
* Local voluntary organisations, and CBOs/NGOs;
a Government agencies and departments;

Other project-stakeholders, such as women, prominent persons from the villages (such
as teachers, health workers, doctors).
All households were covered under the initial rounds of consultation (door-to-door
personal interviews). The household level consultations were carried out with the help
of a checklist prepared and circulated in advance to the various groups through the
Village Council Presidents. Village level meetings (See Table 4.1) were also conducted.
The information regarding the meeting schedule was announced over the Public

4.1.3. Issues Raised During Consultations
The issues of the community in the Project Impacted Villages were compiled on the
basis of questionnaire based surveys and group discussions. Table 4.2 summarises the
questionnaire-based issues. The questionnaire-based surveys were conducted during
October and November 20011". The group discussions were conducted on 5th and 6th
November 2001. Table 4.3 gives the issues raised during the discussions. Both specific,
issues of villages and common issues raised by the villagers have been described.
4.1.4. Perceived Impacts
In almost all meetings, the villagers seem to take their environmental resources for
granted. None of the impacts on natural resources identified by the project team were
perceived to be a significant. In fact, their perception of important issues focused more
on the socio-economic aspects of the proposed development - reduced travel time

compensation, etc. The only environmental issues, which were mentioned, albeit for
their social impacts, were the blasting and its impacts as well as disposal site locations,
additional disposal for leveling and future use of such locations. Another issue raised
was the impacts on the Christian Hospital and the Church at Serkawn. Here too, the
concern was due to the impacts on the patients and worshippers. The overall summary
of the issues perceived important by the roadside population is summorised below.

0  The project would accelerate development of trade and commerce, which in turn
would lead to an overall increase in the standard of living in the villages.
0  The project would enable the people to save time, money and fuel.
*  Travelling to places like Lunglei and Aizawl for medical treatment would be easier.
*   PAPs would be able to sell agricultural products more profitably as improved road
condition will enable access to a wider market area. More villages would be able to sell
perishable goods to the urban centres (which is difficult now due to the long travel
time).
*   More individual households would be able to open small roadside businesses (such as
provision shops, 'vehicle repairing' shops, restaurants) to increase their income.
*   Influx of tourists and visitors would help the local entrepreneurs.
*   Value of land will increase after the project is implemented.
e   Communication with other villages and urban areas will be improved.
(b)      Negative Impacts
v The PAPs were apprehensive about just and timely payment of compensation by the
Government. People were assured that all possible, and feasible actions would be
taken up to ensure that such issues do not arise in the project. They were informed
about the compensation and assistances that would be given to them against loss of
assets. land and livelihood.

EtA for P18, June 2003
0 There were apprehensions about timely completion of the project and the quality
control mechanism. The implementation schedule and arrangements, including the
procurement of supervision consultants and technical auditors were explained to the
people:
0 Dust and debris due to hill cutting and the adverse impacts on the valley side were the
important concerns raised by the community. Appropriate precautions need to be
taken for the safety of structures on the valley side.
o There were apprehensions of an increase in landslides due to the cutting of hillside
slopes and the trees.
o The project might increase the chances of vehicular accidents since traffic in general
would increase after the project is completed.
4.2. POST-DESIGN CONSULTATION
The Independent Environment Review team conducted the post design appraisal of
the issues raised by the community. The process adopted for the appraisal includes:
8 On site assessment of issues raised by the community:
o Discussions with the stakeholders on specific issues:
8 Integration of community issues with the mitigation strategies: and
v Design Response to the issues raised.
The post-design consultation was restricted to specific issues raised by the villagers in
the light of the proposed design for the project corridor. The site visits were conducted
between 9th and 13th January 2003. The issues have been detailed in Table 4.4 along
with the design response to these issues has been given. Follow up consultations shall
be conducted with the final designs displayed for the public
4.3.  FOLLOW UP CONSULTATION PROGRAMME
The follow up consultation process is conducted by the NGO with the objective of
involving the stakeholders in every stage of project implementation. It involves two
components viz, information disclosure and continuous consultation with the PAPs and
roadside communities where appropriate.
4.3.1. Information Disclosure
The Phase 11 EA documents will be disclosed at each of the project-affected villages,
for the benefit of the interested community, and the stakeholders. The reports would be
kept at a community place so that it is accessible to all the villagers.
The report will also be available, with the PWD headquarters at Aizawl and the PIU
office at Aizawl. The report from these places will be available to the public on request
for reference. PWD project implementation unit office will provide actual information
on policies and other rehabilitation action plan to the people, on a regular basis.

Also, the PAPs would be informed by the NGO of the final project design and the
solutions devised for the issues raised by them during the earlier stages of consultation.
Table 4.4 gives the issues and the design responses which need to be disclosed to the
villagers.
4.3.2. Continued Consultation
As part of the continued consultation program, the following actions are proposed:
a The NGO involved in implementation of the R&IPDP will organise public meetings, and
will appraise the communities about the progress in the implementation of R&R and
Environmentali works as required.
* The functions of Grievance Redressal Committees (GRCs) through which the project
road traverses should be explained to the PAPs. The representatives of the PAPs will be
associated with the committee.
* The resettlement sites, other amenities and facilities to be made available to the PAPs
will be disclosed to them in consultation sessions.
* The NGO will organise public meetings to inform the community about the entitlements
and provisions under the project. Regular update of the progress of resettlement
component of the project (summary version of the report submitted by the NGO) will be
placed for public display at PIU office.
* All monitoring and evaluation reports of the R&R components of the project will be
disclosed in the some manner as suggested in this R&IPDP report.
Table 4.5 summorises the important aspects of continued community participation in
the project. Though the focus is on implementation of R&R issues, it is expected that
the NGO selected for the plantation component will continue to provide key inputs to
the entire consultation process, either on its own, or through the PIU.

5. Analysis of Alternatives



5. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
Activities in Phase II of MSRP, along PIB, are essentially the same as for Phase I and
have therefore been already covered in the earlier assessment. As shown in Figure
5.1, the scope of SEA covered selection of alignment alternatives. Both phases of the
project PIA and PIB are a part of the prioritised alternative of SEA. Hence for the
purpose of this report. scope of alternative analysis is limited to evaluation of
realignment options for short stretches and mitigation alternatives for the alignment.
Both the components are dealt with in the following sections.
5.1.  WITHOUT PROJECT AND WITH PROJECT SCENARIOS
One highly unlikely, but theoretically possible, decision could be not to proceed with
PI B Upgradation because of unacceptable residual impacts. There is no information
other than that presented in SEA regarding the existing environmental conditions or
the anticipated impacts, which would justify without project scenorio. Impacts due to
the project implementation are not significant and mitigation measures can be built
into the project to reduce them to acceptable levels. However, if it is decided not to
proceed with the project. the reduced socio-economic development of this remote,
relatively poorly connected hill state cannot be justified.
5.2.  ALIGNMENT SELECTION (ENTIRE BUANGPUI - LUNGLEI SECTION)
For road projects in hills, provision of new alignments is very expensive and would
involve adverse environmental impacts. Even from the environmental perspective.
widening along an existing alignment may be more acceptable than a fresh
alignmert. Phase II of MSRP has few new realistic alternative alignments that remain
unexplored. SEA prepared for the project analysed the road sector as a whole from
an environmental perspective. Moreover, since the decision to follow the older PW.D
alignment hcs already been made, the examination of alternative alignments for PIB
would not be useful.
5.3.  RE-ALIGNMENTS FOR SHORT STRETCHES
Wherever short re-alignments are required from the geometric cnd/or safety angle,
preference is given to hillside cutting over the filling up of valleys, especially if the
slopes are very steep, as is the case in Mizoram. Only in short stretches valley side
realignment is recommended, since the creation of the new formation on retaining
wall can be prohibitively expensive and lack of stfbilisation of fill, in absence of a
retaining wall is a real safety risk. However, in cases of valley side widening, one
advantage is that the space between the two alignments can be used for filling up
the excess cut material. Hill side widening was also a preferred solution from
minimising displacement point of view. To assess the likely social impacts the number

of structures within a likely corridor of impact12 of 12 m was analysed. Table 6-2 shows
that 628 structures are there on the hill side as compared to 468 on the valley side.
However, in the settlements of Kangmun and Haulowng. higher number of structures is
located towards the valley side.
In Pukpui (161.820 km - 162.040km) the alignment was further altered (refer figure 5.2)
to save 3 houses without alternative land for relocation. As a result only one house will
be affected and the owner has alternative io'nd to shift his residence. In Haulawng
(1 32.340km to 132.400km) alignment could be shifted hillside (refer figure 5.3) to save 5
structures on valley side and affect only 3 on the hillside. In these settlements, minor
realignments have been adopted to best fit the proposed cross-section to reduce
impacts.

In all cases, it needs to be ensured that the hydraulic continuity of the terrcin is
maintained    since   accumulated     water can     become     a   potential hazard    -  by
increasing vulnerability of slopes to sliding. An alternative to this can be the disposing
only enough debris so that the height of the fill remains below the invert level of the
lower cu,lvert, whether on the existing or the proposed alignment. However, this would
mean far less disposal space. Therefore, the Contractor and Engineer will have to
identify more locations suitable for disposol along the route as the construction
progresses.

Mizorarn State Roods Prsject Phase-li
EJA for P I, June 2003
5.3.1. Design of Road Junction at Christian Hospital in Serkawn
The Christian Hospital in Serkawn is a reminder of the commendable role Missionary
activity has played in the overall development of Mizoram. Presently, the approach to
the hospital from the project road is by a rising ramp (Figure 5-4). Another side of the
hospital can be approached from a level rood leading to a hydroelectric project and
the Baptist Mission's other buildings. The [evelling of the junction. by lowering the road
from 'he hydroelectric project site side will have multiple benefits, including reducing
noise levels at the hospital.
The consultations with various stakeholders including hospital staff, local
representatives and the Mission trustees involving the environmental and design
teams of the PCC has led to the evolution of 4 alternative designs (Figures 5-5, 5-6,
5-7 & 5-8) a bfief about each alternative would be required in addition to the option
of maintaining the present conditions. Each alternative has its own advantages over
the others. The fincl alternative involves construction of a retaining wall of 6m high
above the existing wall. Hence, the noise gets damped before being transmitted io
the hospital, reducing the noise levels. No other measures will be required to reduce
the noise levels.
Noise Barrier for the School at Ramlaitui
In Ramiaitui village, the secondary school is located adjacent to the road. It is housed
in a wooden building with from the back, away from the road (Figure 5-9). The school
is not being relocated. Here, in addition to the noise level, safety of students is also an
issue to be addressed.
Figure 5-9 Govt. Middle School at Ramlaitui Village
Here too, the options ccn be use of barrier or double-glazing. The advantage of
barriers in this particular instance stems from the requirement of safety of the students.
Since the structure is made from wood, the replacement with double glazed shutters

would be difficult. Therefore, the preferred solution is provision of a barrier on the side
of the road with an entry gate on the side.
Once the proposed mitigation method is decided, the choice of the material for the
construction of the barrier is the next aspect to be considered. The candidate
materials are bamboo and stone. Bamboo is locally available, cheap and easy to
install. However, stone masonry is stronger and results in a more integrated structure,
whichF will have, better sound insulation. Moreover, during site visits, the headmaster of
the school has specifically requested the provision of a permanent structure. In light of
all these, the preferred solution is a 3 m. high stone masonry wall. This item too will be
reflected in the civil works contract and executed during the project implementation
stage.

6. ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND
MITIGATION MEASURES
6.1.  BASIC APPROACH
The environmental components that are impacted during various stages of project
planning and implementation have to be mitigated and incorporated in the
engineering design.
The Upgradation work of Buangpui - Lunglei (P!B) road will involve widening and
relaying of pavement. Proposed improvements are along the existing alignment
except at some critical sections of the road where environmental, social or
engineering aspects warranted realignment for short stretches.
The assessment of impacts and subsequent mitigation measures adopted are
presented in the following sections. The chapter is built on the experiences derived
from implementation of Phase I of the project (refer Annexure 6.1).
6.2.  IMPACTS ON THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
6.2.1. Meteorological Conditions
As only roadside hill faces up to a height of 10-20 m are likely to be cut, no significant
impacts on wind profile and rainfall pattern shall be observed in the project area. The
adverse impacts on the climatic conditions shall only be of temporary nature e.g.
increase in temperature due to removal of roadside plantation and vegetation. The
localized short-term adverse impacts will be offset by compensatory afforestation of
vegetation and tree plantation. No other specific mitigation measures are proposed.
6.2.2. Land
Loss of Cultivable Land and Top Soil
Permanent and temporary acquisition of agricultural land for widening, workers
camps, stockyards, storage godowns etc. will also have a negative impact, depriving
the local people of their livelihood. Cutting of hill slope will result in removal of topsoil,
trees, vegetation cover and loss of cultivable land affecting the livelihood of the
landowners. The effects will have direct, long-term and irreversible impacts on the
surrounding environment. Cutting of hill slopes will involve elimination of productive
topsoil due to loss of micronutrients to sustain growth of vegetation, standing crops
and other commercially important vegetation.
Destabilization of Slopes and Soil erosion
Widening of the priority road will involve rock/soil cutting of hillside, blasting of rocks
rendering the hill slopes unstable and vulnerable to landslides.

mizOrOm Stare Roads Project Phase-ll
EIA for P I B. June 2003
* Cutting of the hill faces to widen the road will have direct and long term impact e.g.
disruption to stability of cut slopes, modification of drainage patterns and erosion,
increase in overburden on the valley slopes due to disposal of the debris from cut
slopes resulting in their instability.
 Felling of plants/trees, vibrations from construction machinery, passing of heavy
vehicles and action of rcin on the soil during the construction stage would also
contribute to soil erosion and destabilization of hill slopes.
Earthwork for upgradation of corridor
Widening and strengthening of the priority road involves cutting of hillside. Thereby it
creates significant amount of eorth, which will be utilized for the project. The material
shall be utilized for construction of embankments for various realignment sections and
other earth works. However, disposal of excess cut material has to be done at
designated locations selected as disposal sites. The estimated quantities of earth
material to be utilized for road construction and to be disposed off at the designated
disposal sites are given below:
*  Earth work due to hill cutting                      =     9,96,575 m3
*  Earth material to be utilized in road works         =     5.55,457 m3
C  Earthwork to be disposed off at designated disposal sites  =  4,48,733 m3
*  Earthwork that can be absorbed in the identified sites  =  1,71,010 m3
Quarrying and Borrowing Operations
As hill cutting shall produce enough earth material for road works and aggregate
material shall be procured from quarries located in the Priority road P1A, quarrying
and borrowing operations are not envisaged along the project corridor. Though the
operation of quarries is an independent and regulated activity, large requirement of
stone aggregate for the project will cause resource depletion in the state. Similarly.
river sand is a scarce commodity in the entire state and therefore, borrowing of sand
from riverbed shall have significant resource depletion. Therefore as an alternative,
the possibility of using stone crusher dust has been explored. There are many stone
crushers along the route who are willing to supply the material, However haphazard
transportation of stone crusher dust from its source to the construction site can have
negative impact on the air quaiity.
6.2.3. Watercourses and Water Bodies
The proposed widening and improvement of PI B will have wvide range of impacts on
water resources in the project area during construction works. Table 6.1 presents
impacted water bodies along the PIB. The Location of main features such as river,
pond, waterfall etc. along the Priority Road is given in Figure 6.1.

AMizorOm State Roads Project Phose-ll
EIA for P18. June 2003
Mizoram receives a lot of rain, but has no significant water storage capacity as the
steep terrain makes water retention extremely difficult. Road construction process
which demands continuous supply of clean water will bear considerable pressure on
water holdings in the project area. The viability of building water-harvesting structures
along the watercourses and streams will need to be worked out. Small check dams
(Figure 6.7) in the form of cascades shall be constructed to augment water
requirement during road construction, and may later be used by the local
community.
The water quality of surface waters in the project area may get contaminated
temporarily due to accidental spill of construction materials, oil, grease, fuel and paint
from the equipment yards and asphalt plant.

Single lane steel Bailey bridge with a span of 45 m in between 150.300km and
150.345km shall be replaced with double lane concrete bridge having a span of
92.7m constructed in between 150.160km and 150.480km. The construction of new
bridge can cause contamination of the river water due to spillage of construction
material. Sediment loading is most likely when large amounts of soil are disturbed and
exposed to the erosive forces. In addition to the disposal of soils, the increased
sediment load due to the constricted waterway cause increased turbidity
downstream of the bridge location.
During the construction of the road, there will be movement of construction
machinery and setting up of a construction labour camp near the bridge site. There
are chances of oil spills taking place near the site. In addition, construction camp
discharges are likely to contaminate the site and water with refuse, garbage etc.

mizorom Sfare Roccs Project Phase-i;
EiA for P18, June 2C03
Other Water Bodies - Ponds and Waterfalls
There are eight waterfalls at Km 150.960, 151.480, 151.600, 151.660, 151.780, 151.840.
151.940 and 152.200Kms and three ponds at Km 101.900, 128.060, 128.120 that will be
impacted due to construction activity.
The possible causes of adverse impacts could be fuel and lubricant spills or leaks from
construction vehicles or from fuel storage and distribution sites or from hot-mix plants
or accidental fuel spills etc.
The watercourses are mainly seasonal, flowing with their full capacity during the
monsoon season. They however, constitute important outlets as water aquifers from
the hills and also below the ground. The cutting of hill slopes for widening and
improvement of the priority road will disturb the natural drainage of these streams thus
making their present accessibility to the local people extremely difficult or impossible.
It is important to note that in a state like Mizoram where water is scare, the local
people tap these water streams for use.
Other Water sources
In addition to the water bodies, the local people use a number of hand pumps sited
along the Priority Road. Though water from these hand pumps in most cases is not
potable, it is utilized for washing and other purposes. Some of these hand pumps are
seasonal in nature, while the others supply water throughout the year. Due to the
widening of the Priority Road, some of these hand pumps will have to be removed.
6.2.4. Air Quality
Negative impacts on Air Quality during construction will be mostly localized
concentrated within the RoW. Due to a large number of activities both dust and
polluting gases like S02. NOx and Hydrocarbons will be generated. However, it is likely
that impacts due to dust generation are felt downwind of the site rather than the site
itself. Large quantities of dust may have serious implications on the heaith of the
people living in the valleys. Construction workers, especially in quarries, borrow areas
and stone crushing units will also be subjected to serious implications by exposure to
dust. Operation stage impact due to traffic on the priority road shall not be significant
since the project volumes low.
6.2.5. Noise Quality
Noise levels in the project area during the construction stage will increase, though
shall be intermittent and temporary in nature.
The noise levels for various construction octivities/ equipments, though in excess of
the permissible standards, due to their intermittent nature, the impact of increased
noise levels would only be temporary. Even so, the extreme!.' high sound levels

present a risk to the workers on the site. Since the anticipated volume of the traffic on
the road during operational phase is low, the impacts are of less 5ignificance. The
noise levels will be much more pronounced during construction stage particularly
around settlements and in inhabited areas.
6.3.   IMPACTS ON BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
6.3. 1. Terrestrial Ecology
Flora
Widening and strengthening of Priority Road shall involve removal of topsoil and
cutting of hill fcce up to heights of almost 5-10 m on an average. It results in clearing
of vegetation cover and felling of trees. These activities will exert wide-ranging
impacts on the surrounding as summarized in Table 6.2 below.
Table 6-2: Likely Impacts on Flora for Widening of Priority Road
Activity         I                     Impact
Cutting of hill slope/fcce, removal  Loss of vegetation cover (shrubs &grosses) canopies;
of earth/rock                 Felling of 1,177 trees along priority road;
cutting of hill slope/face   Reduced shade and shelter for roadside fauna
Reduction in soil fertility, moisture and humidity;
Workers Camps                Use of plants and trees as fuel wood and wildlife pocching
by construction workers
Roadside Trees
7518 trees of different species having girth more than 30cm within 15 m of the existing
bench were counted out of which a total number of 1177 trees and plants are likely
to be uprooted due to widening of the Buangpui - Lunglei Road.
During the bio-diversity assessment survey carried out along the priority road PlB,'a
number of locations have been spotted which are rich in species of herbs and shrubs,
trees, ethno-medicinal plants and birds. The only endangered tree fern (Cyathea
dealbata) found along the project road will not be threatened by construction
activities since it is available in mizoram State in abundance.
Fauna
*  Invertebrates
Species of 'dragon flies' are reported to exist along the project road. The marshy area
(100.160km) is a breeding ground for dragon flies'. Any disposal in the area can
destroy the marshy area.

EIA for PIS, June 2003
The marsh has dense aquatic macrophytes and is reported to be a breeding ground
of amphibians, which can be threatened due to unwanted disposal of debris.
* Birds
The proposed Saza-Tlawng Sanctuary is reported to house the endangered species
Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus). Besides a host of other species like the Gallus
gallus (Jungle fowl), partridge etc. are found which can fall prey to hunting and
poaching.
. Mammals
Rare and endangered animal species like the flying fox: Chinese pangolin, tiger,
common leopard etc. have been reported to exist in protected areas of Mizoram. It
is however, reported that the priority road PiB (Buangpui-Lunglei Road) does not
show presence of any of these animals. The proposed Saza-Tlawng Sanctuary is
reported to house endangered species like the Saza (Capricornis sumatroensis),
Leopard (Ponthera sp.) etc., besides a host of other mammalian species. However, no
records are available to confirm the presence of endangered animal species. Owing
to low traffic volume and seclusion from the habitation, impact on fauna will be
minimal.
6.3.2. Riverine Reserve forest
The project road passes through the Riverine reserve forest of Tlawng. The riverine
reserve, though it is a reserve forest, human interference is evident. Private plantations
are also found in the Pukpui side with standing crops on both the banks of Tlawng and
private plots are found on Mausen village side. The biodiversity assessment indicates
absence of any threatened, endangered or rare species in the riverine reserve.
Moreover, the forest cover on both sides of the Tlawng is mainly secondary nature.
Only a few small patches of original moist deciduous forests can be seen at higher
slope, which will not be affected by the construction of bridge over Tlawng or by
widening of P1 B.
6.3.3. Proposed Saza-Tiang Sanctuary
The project corridor forming the boundary of proposed sanctuary, very short stretches,
less than I km in length over several locations, widening on the hillside will require land
within the area proposed to be included within the sanctuary. However, a 5m strip of
land is available for widening along the corridor, declared as a road reserve.
Biodiversity survey indicates no presence of threatened, endangered or rare species
in the proposed sanctuary area.

The Ichthyological survey on the river Tlawng found green algae like Ulothrix spp.,
Fontinolis spp. The riparian vegetation is composed mainly of Agerefum conyzoides,
Sacchorum sp, Cynodon doctylon, Mikonia microntha, Imperata cylindrico species.
The construction of new bridge on the River Tlawng will invariably cause
cur itamination of the river water due to spillage of construction material. Sedime, 1i
loading is likely to occur as large amounts of soil shall be disturbed and exposed to
the erosive forces. In addition to the disposal of soils from the riverbed, the increased
sediment load due to the constricted waterway and consequent increased sediment
load wili cause increased turbidity downstream of the bridge location. Large heavy
sediments may smother the flora and change the nature of the substratum resulting in
decline in the number and diversity of plants'4.
Fauna
*  Invertebrates
Larva and adults of various benthic invertebrates were seen during the ichthyological
surveys, which are preyed upon by other species. Any change in the water quality
due to negligence in the construction activity can disastrously alter the food web.
. Amphibians
Large colonies of tadpoles were sighted during the survey installation of the nets. Calls
of frogs were also heard during the night and evening. Any change in the present
population of the micro invertebrates shall affect them.
* Pisces
The on the river Tlawng identified fish species of Puntius ticto, Amblypharyngodon
molo and Channa striotus. During construction if the concentration of the suspended
solids exceeds 185mg/l then the gills of the fish may be damaged'5.
* Birds
A number of avian species (water fowls) e.g. Kingfisher were identified by sighting and
calls during installing the nets, which depend upon the fish and other species for
survival. Any alteration to the existing aquatic environment con have repercussions on
the avian species.

6.4.  THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT - MITIGATION MEASURES
6.4. 1. Land
Structural Engineering Techniques
In order to stabilize the slopes on the hillside, retaining walls shall be incorporated in
the project design at vulnerable locations. Three types of design for retaining walls
have been proposed to enhance the stability of slopes on the hillside at different
locations of the project road. These are:
* ROI       Dry Random Rubble Masonry for Heights < = 2.0 m
* RO I g    Bamboo crib walls/ Gabion for Height < = 2.0 m
& RO2g      Gabion for Heights > 2.0 m < = 5.0 m
*  R02      Composite Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > = 2.0 m but < = 5.0 m
* R03       Mortared Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > 3.0 m but < = 6.0 m
* R04       Reinforced Cement Concrete for Heights > 5.0 m < = 6.0 m
Similarly, to stcbilize the slopes on the valley-side when ii is required to widen the road
by filling on the valley-side, breast walls will be provided at different locations of the
project road. Depending on the height of cut to be supported and other site
conditions, different types of Breast walls have been.provided at different locations of
the project road. Five types of Breast Walls designed to stabilize the slopes on valley
side are:
*  RO1      Dry Random Rubble Masonry for Heights < = 2.0 m
RO iRg      Bamboo Crib walls/gabions for Heights < = 2.0 m
*  R02      Composite Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > = 2.0 m but < = 5.0 m
* RO2g      Gabions for heights >2.0 m < =5.0 m
a  R03      Mortared Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > 5.0 m
Details of the locations where each type of wall is provided is available in the
engineering design. However, No detailed observational data is available on the
geomorphology of the specific locations. Hence, it may be prudent to allot fund
related to the protection measures carefully segregated, to be expended with
necessary features if any major disturbances to slopes are revealed. Based on
observa4ions on site, mitigation measures at specific locations are appended in
Annexure 3.1. Implementation agencies would be required adopt most economical
measures after the cuts are further exposed on a case-to-case basis.
* Bioengineering Techniques for Soil Stabilization
Bioengineering is the successful use of vegetation in combination with structural
engineering techniques to increase slope stability. In comparison to hard armour
solutions, bioengineering is cost effective, aesthetically pleasing and environmentally
acceptable solution. Various Bioengineering techniques as described below are

proposed to regenerate lost green cover due to cutting of hill slopes. These are also
shown in Figure 6.2.
* Species Selection
Where possible, the use of non-native species should be avoided since they can out
compete and displace native plants. To maximize the chances of success, one should
try to select species whose growing conditions roughly match the environmental
conditions of the p.iject site. Care should also be taken to select species with root
systems that match the nature of the soil at the project site. Table 6.3 and Table 6.4
gives in details the floral species recommended for bioengineering near settlements
within 1 km of the last dwelling) and outside settlements.
Beside these recommended species Pterydophyta species like, Lycopodium spp.,
Seloginella spp., Polytrichum spp., and Sphagnum spp., which are found widespread
in the area, can be planted to stabilise the soil both on the valley slope and road
shoulders. The bryophytes and pteridophytes are provided with rhizoids that have a
high cumulative soil-binding capacity. Moreover, these plants, due to their habit forms
extensive spongy mats on exposed soil, protecting the soil effectively against the
bombardment of raindrops.
Besides serving the purpose of soil binding, plants like broom and thatch grasses could
also benefit the local community who could maintain these patches on a sustainable
utilization basis, thus boosting the social welfare component of the proiect.
Various Bioengineering techniques
Contour Wattling:
This method is used to control surface erosion by breaking long slopes into shorter
slopes. Bundles of branches, called wattles or fascines, are placed in shallow trenches
along the slope or stream bank contour. Trenches are excavated by hand to half the
diameter of the bundles. Wattles are typically 8 to 10 inches in diameter and
branches secured with twine. After the wattle is staked in place, the trench is
backfilled until only the top of the bundle is exposed. Wattles can be used for hill
slope restoration, road embankments, wide gullies, or slump areas.
Chevron Grass Lines:
Chevron grass lines are planted as covering diagonal grass at an angle of between
300 - 400 off the horizontal. This grass-planting pattern is recommended on steep,
bodly riled slopes with coarse surface soils. It is used to direct surface runoff to stable
disposal areas such as rill or rip rap channel, or a natural drainage line, thus utilizing
the natural drainage pattern. The chevron-planting pattern can also be reversed to
divert runoff to the centre of the batter and thereby promote infiltration.

Diagonal Grass Lines:
Diagonal grass lines are planted at an angle of 300 - 450 off horizontal, across the
slope. Grass slips are planted at 20 cm intervals, with lines generally spaced at 50 cm
intervals. The diagonal configuration is recommended on steep slopes where low
volumes of runoff occur (i.e. where a small overland catchment exists above the
road). The planting pattern prevents rill formation and retains eroded soil on the slope.
Brush Matting:
This method protects stream banks by placing a mattress-like layer of branches over it
to protect soil and slow water velocity. The mat is composed of interwoven, usually
dead, branches secured to the soil by live stakes, wire, twine or live branches. Live
stakes are often cut from dormant willow. Brush matting helps collect sediment and
enables establishment of vegetation on banks. Like brush layering, this method
requires large quantities of branches.
Live Cuttings:
Live cuttings can be used to secure materials in place and to increase plantings on a
slope. Live cuttings can be from 18 inches to 4 feet in length. Longer cuttings are used
for live staking of wattles, while shorter cuttings are used for plantings.
Fascines:
Fascines are made of vegetatively propagated plant cuttings tied together into 15-20
cm bundles and dug into slopes on the contour to this depth. Fascines are
recommended to stabilize small, critical slopes, and to protect riprap on slopes.
Fascines provide a physical barrier to hold surface soil as well as drainage path, while
cuttings rapidly develop roots that bind the slope.
Palisades:
Woody cuttings are planted at 10-15 cm intervals next to each other in lines across
the slope, usually on the contour, to form palisades. They form a strong barrier that
holds eroded soil, ultimately forming small terraces suitable for the establishment of
vegetation. Palisades are recommended for all slopes except where minor slumps are
likely. The SALT technique of soil conservation, developed in the Philippines for hill
agriculture up to 350, is based on this technique.
Combir{ations:
Combinations of the above practices are usually used for most bioengineering
designs. For example, brush wattles and live staking is a common combination used
to stabilize slopes. A coir fascine can be used with live plantings, brush matting and
trench packing to restore marshes or stream channels. New combinations of existing
methods, and the use of new materials, will provide creative applications of
bioengineering techniques.

In order to stabilize the slopes, species, which have laterally spreading adventitious
roots, and clump-forming tendency are planted that results in effective soil binding.
Some species gives off roots from nodes while creeping that penetrates the exposed
surface and clings to the soil. The bryophytes. on the other hand, are provided with
rhizoids that have a high cumulative soil-binding capacity. Besides, these plants,
because of their habit of forming extensive spongy mats on exposed soil, protect the
soil effectively against the bombardment of raindrops.

Certain locations are to be avoided for disposal of waste material, as these locations
are ecologically important. Table 6.8 lists out such locations. Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4
show chainage-wise locations of marsh and fishpond which need to the protected
from disposal of waste material. Figure 6.5 shows pictorial view of sites that need to
the avoided from disposal of waste material. In general, the disposal sites were
selected keeping in mind the following aspects;
* Water resources such as ponds. rivers should not get polluted:
* The disposal site should have adequate capacity to contcin the waste material:
. Sites rich in bio-diversity must be avoided; and
a The disposal site should not be located downwind side of the residential areas.
a Protection Measures to Contain Disposed Material
In order that the excavated rock / soil does not spread all over on the valley side, toe
walls of the following design will be provided at disposal site depending on the
amount of dumped material:
Dry Random Rubble Masonry for Heights < = 2.0 m
. Bamboo / Gabion Wire Crates / Bamboo Crib Walls for Heights <=2.0 m
> Gabions for Heights > 2.0 m < = 5.0 m
Composite Random Rubble Masonry for Heights > 2.0 m < = 5.0 m
Precautions to be cdopted during debris disposal / waste material are presented in
Annexure 6.2
* Rehabilitation of Dump Sites
Locations of dumpsites are as indicated in Table 6.5 and Table 6.7
The disposal sites as given in Table 6.7 have been selected as a consequence of
change in alignment of the road. These sites do not contain any environrmental
resources, which require protection. The areas surrounding these dump sites hove
indigenous vegetation available throughout the project corridor.

- The terrain being mountainous, it has been estimated that the amount of spoil and cut
material to be disposed off will exceed the amount than the identified dumpsites
could absorb.
> These dumpsites have to be suitably rehabilitated by planting local species of shrubs
and other plants. Local species of trees {e.g. bamboo etc.) are also to be planted so
that the landscape is coherent and is in harmony with its various components.
r Terraces can be made on the dumpsites and converted to plantation or for growing
agricultural produce such as ginger, t :: ieric, and oranges.
> In cases where a dumpsite is close to the local village community settlements, it could
be converted into a play field by spreading the dump material evenly on the ground.
Such playground could be made coherent with the landscape by planting trees all
along the periphery of the playground.
Location of Construction / Labour Camps
Likely candidate locations for construction camps are indicated in Table 6.9.
However, out of these five locations only two could be found satisfying all the criteria
for setting up of construction camp. These two locations are given in Table 6.1 0.

The construction camps will be located at least 500m away from habitations at
identified sites and 1OOOm away from those listed in Table 6.8. All other sanitary and
heaith facilities shall be provided at these locations as per Annexure 6.3
Rehabilitation of Quarry / Borrow Pits
As hill cutting shall produce enough earth material for road works and aggregate
material shall be procured from quarries located in the Priority road P1A, Quarrying
and borrowing operations are not envisaged in the project corridor. But in cose earth
material produced doesn't meet the required standard and the Contractor has to

make borrow pits/quarry areas, the borrow pits/quarries has to be rehabilitated by
following the instructions presented in Appendix 6.4.
Compaction of Soil
The construction equipment. vehicles and machinery shall be moved or stationed
only in designated areas (COI or ROW as applicable), while operating on temporarily
acquired land for traffic detours, storage, material handling or any other construction
related or incidental activity. Topsoil from agricultural land must be removed and
preserved, which after the activity is over should be replaced and . properly
rehabilitated.
6.4.2. Watercourses And Water Bodies
The water resources are likely to be affected during execution of the project. It is
therefore, imperative that adequate mitigation measures are adopted and
incorporated into the project designs to offset the adverse impacts. In sections below
some of these measures are described.
All water sources potable or else used by the public/community e.g. water tanks at
the streams if lost due to widening of the road shall be replaced immediately.
Relocation of the source of water shall be decided in consultation with the local
people. Replacement shall be carried out prior to demolition of the existing
structure/source of water.
Drainage and Hydrological flow
a Detailed drainage surveys and hydrological investigdtions have been ccrried out and
suitable design of bridges and culverts proposed. V-shaped 150mm thick drains of
cement concrete having top width of 600mm and depth of 300mm - 900mm shall be
provided towards the hillside all along the corridor except in inhabited areas.
* In inhabited areas, the cross-drainage structures provided have 100mm thick drain of
cement concrete with top and bottom widths of 600mm and 230mm respectively and
a depth of 350mm. The existing culverts and other drainage structures will be replaced
with new cross-drainage structures of sizes as mentioned above.
In addition to the above design requirements, the contractor shall ensure that during
construction work the following are taken care of:
* Construction work near water bodies have to be carried out in such a way that flow of
water is not blocked. Even if it has to be blocked, the contractor must ensure that the
local communities are informed about the same in advance. Work near the water
bodies should be carried out in dry season.
 Flooding of local drainage channels, waterfalls/streams;

* Measures to ensure that remnants from earthwork, stonework and other waste
material do not hinder the cross-drainage of rivers, canals, streams and existing
irrigation channels: and
* In sections of the road near to watercourses or cross-drainage channels, the
construction material waste would be disposed off in a manner not to block the flow
of water.
& The wastes arising from the project would be collected, stored and disposed off at
approved disposcl sites as per St-We Pollution Control Board norms.
Quality of water in water bodies
The quality of water in the water bodies (Tlowng River, marsh, and Ponds) shall be
maintained by adopting following mitigation measures:
* Construction work close to the streams/water bodies and construction of bridges will
be avoided during monsoon.
& Silt fencing to be provided near construction area to prevent sediments entering the
watercourses.
* The fuel storage and vehicle cleaning area shall be stationed at least 300m away from
the nearest drain/water body
* The slope of the embankments leading to water bodies shall be modified and re-
channelled to prevent entry of contaminants into the water body.
* Discharge of oil and grease is most likely from construction vehicle parking area,
vehicle repair area and workshops. An oil interceptor shall be provided to ensure that
all wastewater flows into the interceptor prior to its discharge.
Enhancement of Waterfalls
Though there are a number of waterfalls along the project roads, most of these are
seasonal in nature and are dried up as soon as the monsoon season is over. Applying
appropriate mitigation measures, however, should preserve some of these waterfalls.
One water fall at Km.151.780 is identified for enhancement. Figure 6.6 (a) and Figure
6.6 (b) depicts how the waterfall could be preserved and developed / enhanced as
a recreation spot. At the location enhancement is carried out as explained below:
.  This approach of developing the waterfall gives special consideration to the
environmental sustainability aspects of the feature. The fall is made visually close but
physically- away from viewers.
* On the hillside of the carriageway. a hold up tank is proposed. On the immediate
periphery of this will be the flowering shrub plantations of the indigenous species.
Beyond this there will be viewing platforms, which allow higher-level view of the fall.
Adjacent to this, away from the waterfall, parking is proposed. On the valley side of
the carriageway, water is allowed to pass through a culvert to another smaller hold up
tank from where it is allowed to fall downward.

v  On the hillside, retaining walls can be provided on both sides of the waterfall,
depending upon the erosion control requirement. In these walls, soi! can be filled and
bright floral varieties planted. This shall stabilize as well as beautify the surroundings.
* One prominent waterfall is identified for enhancement. This has considerable flow and
is aesthetically appealing. This waterfall needs conservation as per the designs
mentioned above and some infrastructure to augment local/regional tourism.
. No built-up development is proposed, unless in co-ordination with the tourism
authorities. The possibility of engaging private partners for maintenance and ck.aning
may be explored.
Water Consumption and Harvestinq
Potential water flows in the several natural drainage courses available on the
Upgradation   road  PIB are   assessed. Seven   locations were identified  and
recommended for procuring water during construction to avoid shortage of water to
the local community. The community can use these water storage structures in the
long-term.
Recommendations were made based on the feasibility of constructing the storage
considering (a) availability of space; (b) avoiding potential damage to the road; (c)
avoiding large/high dams/walls; (d) slope and stability of terrain. The storage tanks
should not be washed away during torrents, and therefore restricted storage, allowing
for spill over needed to be designed.
* To overcome the impact on water resources, locations as indicated in Table 6.11 are
selected for water harvesting. Figures 6.7 & 6.8 shows typical design of water
harvesting structures
Table 6-11: Water Harvesting Locations

.  Water harvesting structure can be built in stone masonry, oriented to receive the
water from the valley side of the contours. The higher levels should be planted with
trees and thick shrubs to control the speed of water. This shall also control the erosion
on the hillside and avoid silting of the tanks.

Fuel and Lubricants
* Fuel shall be stored in proper bounded areas.
* All spills and collected petroleum products shall be disposed off in accordance with
the guidelines framed by Ministry of Environment & Forests, New Delhi and Mizoram
Pollution Control Board.
* Maintenance and refuelling of vehicles, machinery and other construction equipment
shall be carried out in such c fashion that spillage of fuels and lubricants does not
conTaminate the ground.
e An "Oil Interceptor" (Figure 6.9) shall be provided for wash down and refuelling areas.
After the construction of road is over, the concerned State Government Department
must prepare contingency plan so as to contain accidental spills.
Hot-mix Plant
Effluents from the hot-mix plants in the form of oil, grease, etc., if not contained and
disposed properly could lead to pollution of land and water in the adjacent areas.
This ,mpact would be more pronounced in the stretch of 101.900, 126.850 &
126.910km, where there are three ponds and a marsh at km 100.160 near the road.
The oil and grease generated may be disposed into pits filled with the clay-shale
dominant debris that would be produced by earth cutting. This material is a good
absorbent and can later be removed and disposed in safer places.
Air Quality
Following mitigation measures shall be implemented to minimise impacts due to air
pollution.
* Location of hotmix plants/asphalt plants/batching plants shall be atleast 1 km down
wind of the settlements

6.4.3. Noise Quality
The following measures could be adopted to mitigate the impact of observed noise
levels:
* Noise barriers of various barrier-wall shapes and textures along with landscaping (i.e.
by planting trees, bushes and shrubs). The important factors that should be taken into
account are relative height of the barWier, the noise source and the horizontal distance
between the source and the barrier and between the barrier and the noise-affected
area.
. Planting of tfees, bushes and shrubs could also be utilized to reduce noise levels
provided the plantings are very dense and have significant depth.
*  Other noise control measures include limitations on allowable grades eg. Open-
graded asphalt and avoidance of surface dressings to reduce tire noise in sensitive
areas. Maintenance of proper road surface repairs also helps in reducing noise levels.
* Noise problems can be minimized by using silenced equipment, following noise control
regulations and limiting work hours near residential areas.
. Facade insulation such as double window glazing, which is usually adopted to
damper/ noise in buildings.
 Barriers and mounds of various materials, which place a solid obstacle between the
road and homes nearby. These usually take the form of earth mounds or solid walls of
wood, metal or concrete. These walls are known as sound barriers, fences or sources
and can be used in conjunction with noise mounds to give additional effective height.
Noise barriers will be r. iost effective if they break the line of sight between noise source
and the properties being protected. and if these are thick enough or adsorb or reflect
the noise received.
* Christian Hospital Lunglei
At the Christian Hospital Lunglei, special noise mitigation measures are proposed. The
land around the Lunglei hospital belongs to the Church and they are willing to donate
the land involved in the road construction as long as the design takes into account
noise and easy accessibility to the hospital and church. A final design (Figure 6.11)
involving improvement of the existing junction, noise barriers such as rows of plants of
different heights to block noise is proposed. The designs are prepared taking into
consideration some minor improvements requested by the Church Officials and
aesthetics. (Figure 6.10)
* School at Ramlaitui
A noise barrier wall has been proposed for the Government Middle School at
Ramlaitui at chainage 111.260 km. The proposed noise bcrrier shall be a 3m high
masonry wall. The contractor cs per the direction and satisfaction of the Supervision
Consultant shall build the wall. Design of the noise barrier is given in Figure 6.12.

6.5.1. Terrestrial Ecology
Flora
* Riverine Reserve forest and Proposed Saza-Tlang Sanctuary and IBAs
Though a reserve forest exists for half a mile on Mausen side of the Tlawng River. there
is little enforcement and human intervention is widespread. This is evident, as the
Revenue Department of the State has issued ownership/occupation rights on the
Pukpui (Lunglei) side of the River Tlawng. This human intervention has seriously
degraded the reserve forest. The Regional Chief Conservator of Forests' Shillong
Office is also set to clear the diversion of Forestland for the project.
Widening on the hillside shall only involve very short stretches, less than I km in length
over several locations within the proposed Soza-Tlawng sanctuary. Government of
Mizoram has also already notified 5m wide strips on both sides of several important
roads including P1 (Aizawl - Lunglei) as road reserve and shall be utilised for the
project.
The stretches mentioned as Important Biodiversity Areas (IBA) are ecologically
important and have the highest species diversity in the project area. Care should be
taken to arrest any negative impact on the proposed, reserve forest and IBAs by
adopting the following mitigation measures:
Plantation of trees (species specified) to be undertaken to offset any negative impact
on the flora.
, Erection of signboards as specified by the engineer in the area mentioning reserve
forest and proposed sanctuary.

EtA for P B8. June 2003
No disposal of debris (other than at areas identified and listed in Table 6.7 and 6.9) to
take place within the present area of the Riverine reserve forest, proposed sanctuary
and the IBAs17.
> Protection of floral species according to directions of the engineer.
.  Replantation
The estimated loss of about 11 77 trees would have to be compensated by extensive
plantations of about 11 770 saplings. The project will involve the Lcal NGOs to re-
vegetate the slopes as per the tree plantation strategy developed. While plantation
is a onetime cost of the project, there is provision fo provide financial incentive to the
local NGOs for maintenance.
Species identified in Table 6.3 and 6.4 should be used as far as practicable, strictly
avoiding any exotic (but popular) species like Eucalyptus that can have far-reaching
adverse effects on the ecology and water regime of the area. The species in the
above mentioned tables have been identified after considering their local
availability, growth, adaptability, invasiveness nature and mainly bioengineering
capabilities. Detailed specifications have been appended to the EMP.
* Protection of Important Floral Species:
Activities during the construction period are likely to have adverse impact on the
endangered plant species located along the carriageway. Bamboo fencing is
proposed for the trees and the shrubs of the area. Provision of bamboo fencing during
construction phase is depicted in the Figure 6.13.
For the shrubs, especially Cyothea spp., an endangered species in the region, closely
spaced bamboo 125-150mm poles shall be erected as a fence at the edge of the
corridor of impact to stop the falling debris. A drain shall be dug along the Col to
prevent runoff from flowing towards the valley. In case of other plant species requiring
shade, a barbed wire fence covered with bamboo mats shall be provided.
Fauna
The contractor shall take responsibility of prohibiting activities like hunting and
poaching of avian and other faunal species, by the construction workers all
throughout the project corridor and especially within the IBAs.
The IBAs identified are listed in Section 3.2 and includes the whole area under proposed sanctuary and the
Riverine Reseo/r Forest.

6.5.2. Aquatic Ecology
If the present water quality is maintained then there shall be no adverse impacts on
the aquatic ecology. For this purpose all the mitigation measures adopted to
maintain the water quality need to be scrupulously adhered to. Also workers need to
be cautioned against unauthorised fishing.
6.6.   SOCIO - ECONOMIC SCENARIO - IMPACTS & MITIGATION MEASURES ALSO
REHABILITATION AND RESETTLEMENT ISSUES
There will be acquisition of land along the upgraddtion route P 1 B. The loss of land, loss
of structures and the loss of livelihood are the main socio-economic impacts of the
project. Since all the impacted persons are indigenous, a Resettlement and
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan has been prepared in accordance with
OD4.20 for mitigating these impacts. Details of the losses, their mitigation and
implementation of these measures are given in the R&IPDP. However, the major
impacts are summorised here:
6.6.1. Loss of Land
A total of 49.5 ha of land is required for the proposed improvements to the Buangpui-
Lunglei section of the Aizawl-Lunglei Road. Most of the land to be acquired is used for
agriculture (permanent or jhum). The maximum land requirement is in Pukpui, where
maximum agriculture land is being taken to save a few residential structures. Details
are available in Chapter 5. Table 6.12 gives the split of the land requirement for the
upgradation along PI B.

6.6.2. Loss of structures
Most structures in Mizoram are built on stilts. There are few RCC structures along the
rood itself. The structures have walls made out of A. C. sheets instead of the traditional
bamboo structures. Only one RCC structure is being affected. Most of the affected
structures are residential. Only 9 commercial structures are being affected. Details for
the private structures are provided in Table 6.13. Particulars of the community
structures can be obtained from the R&IPDP

The loss of livelihood is mainly due to the loss of agricultural land. Most Mizos practise
shifting cultivation. Therefore, loss of livelihood from loss of agricultural land may not
be considered very significant impact as they can easily be granted rights for other
plots which they can use. The details of the loss of livelihood are provided in the Table
6.14.

7. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Since Phase I of MSRP is already being implemented by the MPWD. the arrangements
for the Phase ll is built on the suggestions of the Sectoral Environmental Assessment
using the experiences of Phase I. By-and-large, the project implementation is going on
as envisaged. There are a few aspects of the work, particularly those relating to the
procurement of small service contractors, where streamlining is required during Phase
11. These are addressed at appropriate locations in sections that follow.
7.1.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNIT, MPWD
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is entrusted with the responsibility of the MSRP.
from preparation to implementation of both phases. Currently staffed with 7 full-time
officials, the Unit is functioning from PWD headquarters in Aizawl. A Project Director
(PD), an officer of the Superintending Engineer rank, heads the PIU. The PD is assisted
by three officials (two Executive Engineers and a Special Land Acquisition Officer),
one each looking after procurement. Environmental and Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R&R) issues. These officers in turn have one assistant engineer each,
with an account officer also assisting the Executive Engineer in-charge of
procurement. Experience in Phase I shows that the existing environmental staff of PIU is
falling short of manpower to undertake field visits to inspect work sites. With the
implementation of Phase II, all the works will be running simultaneously. Hence, to
ensure adequate supervision and monitoring from the PIU, another A.E (Environment)
will be procured for assisting E.E(Environment) for implementation of Phase-Il.
7.2.  OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
The PIU has availed services of several consultants for the project - for assisting it with
preparation, institutional strengthening and supervision of implementation of MSRP
Phase-l1. In addition, services of a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) have also
been procured as part of the project for implementation of the R&R activities and
plantation on the roadside, where extra land is available and has recently been
declared as road reserve. Implementation of the actual construction will be through
Contractors procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) route. For
major maintenance component, field units (divisions) of the PWD will act as
supervisors and a consultant is expected to provide quality assurance services.
Contractors for maintenance component are to be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB). The project will also require monitoring by other
government cgencies as MPCB. Department of Environment and Forests etc., at
various points in the project cycle.
The implementation mechanism of PlU, environmental cell is shown in the flow
diagram in Figure 7-1.

7.3.  ENVIRONMENTAL CELL, PIU
The Environmental Cell within the PIU, MPWD includes the Executive Engineer and an
Assistant Environmental Engineer. They, operating as representatives of the Employer
and as a unit are to ensure that the MSRP complies with the environmental covenants
of the agreement with the IDA.
The Environmental Cell will continue to:
* Monitor progress of the implementation of the EMP measures in consonance with the
timeline for the project within the allotted budget;
& Support Division offices' staff on the implementation of ERMP measures along the
routes selected for the mcaor maintenance component;
* Maintain interaction with the various other statutory bodies like Mizoram Pollution
Control Board;
^ Occasionally inspect the environmental measures being implemented by the
Contractor and the NGO responsible for plantation;
Report progress of works, both in terms of ph-.ical progress and quality for transmission
to statutory authorities such as the Ministry of Environment and Forests as well as the
World Bank Group;
* Facilitate training of appropriate PWD staff on Environmental aspects, either through
the Environmental Specialist(s) of the Construction Supervision Consultants and/or
External trciners; and
* Document and disseminate good practices. bottlenecks and their resolution during
the implementation of environmental measures as part of MSRP.
7.4.  PROJECT CO-ORDINATING CONSULTANTS
The role of the PCC, assisting the MPWD in project preparation, gradually reduces as
the project moves entirely into the implementation stage. However, their limited
presence will remain beyond preparation until the end of the project. A limited input
from the Environmental and Social Experts is envisaged when the Supervision
Consultant (SC) for Phase It mobilises. This will be for providing the SC with an overview
of the environmental issues that are to be addressed during implementation.
7.5.  SUPERVISION CONSULTANTS
The Supervision Consultants will be the key to ensure the successful implementation of
EMP provisions during Phase fi. As the 'Engineer' for the Contract, the SC will certify the
Contractors' bills. Since ICB procurement is envisoged, the selected consultants are
expected to have the necessary professional(s) to tackle the issues that MSRP Phase 11
is likely to bring up. The Environmental Specialist of the SC will be a key position that
can be leveraged to ensure thot the Contractor complies with the various EMP

requirements. The draft Terms of Reference for Environmental Specialist are given
below:
The upgradation component of Phase 11 of MSRP will involve improvement the
southern part.of Aizawl - Thenzawl - Lunglei Road (P1) between Buangpui (km
100.000) to Lunglei (km 169.400) & construction of Aizawl bypass with World Bank
assistance. Environmental Management Plans have been prepared for the same
which need to be foVlowed during the implementation of the civil works. The key
responsibility of the Environmental Specialist will be the successful implementation of
the EMP. In addition, s/he will report to the PIU and the World Bank on the progress of
environmental protection and/or enhancement works as envisaged in the EMP. S/he
will also ensure that the environmental capacity available to the PIU during
implementation of MSRP is successfully transferred to MPWD in general and PIU staff in
particular. The desired qualifications of the Environmental Specialist are:
. A degree in Civil and/or Environmental Engineering
* 15 years of experience in Supervision of implementation of Environmental
Management Plar, including at least one linear project
* Prior practical experience in Hill Roads would be an advantage
His/Her responsibilities will include:
* Supervise and monitor the implementation of EMP by the Contractor
*  Review and approve site-specifi environmental mitigation/enhancement designs for
waterfalls, locations for biodiversity protection, etc. worked out by the Contractor
based on the sketches provided in the EMP prepared during project preparation
* Review and recommend the Contractors' Implementation Plans for approval (with
any changes that may be necessary) to ensure compliance with the environmental
provisions of the Contract
a Hold regular meetings with the Environmental Cell of the PIU and keep it updated on
the progress of site works
Prepare and submit Environmental progress report to the Environmental Cell
Develop and organise environmental training programmes to upgrade the skills within
the staff of the Environmental Cell, Contractors and other MPWD staff
* Document and develop good practices during project implementation for wider
dissernination
MSRP Phase 11 will require continuous environmental supervision. It is desirable to have
field staff with environmental functions to be on site for the duration of construction.
Either the field engineers supervising construction can be trained on environmental
aspects or one dedicated junior staff may be stationed for the duration of the project.

7.6.  NON - GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS
Phase 11 of MSRP will utilise the services of a NGO for the implementation of R&R
activities as well as for the plantation on the roadside, where extra land is available
and has recently been declared as road reserve. The NGO will follow the
specifications appended to the Environmental Management Plan for planting of
saplings and for the maintenance of the plantation for 3 years. A separate amount is
budgeted for this roadside plantation in addition to that for compensotorv plantation
at the rate of 10 saplings for each tree felled. In addition to this, they will also be
entrusted the function of occasionally visiting Important Biodiversity Areas (IBAs)
already identified. In these stretches, they can motivate the local people for
conservation efforts and supplement the endeavours of the Environmental Specialist.
They can also send their representatives for training programmes conducted by the
CS and/or PIU so that these grass-roots level workers can go back to the site and train
village council representatives of settlements.
7.7.  QUALITY ASSURANCE CONSULTANTS
The major maintenance component in Phase 11 requires more environmental
supervision than envisaged for Phase 1. Since the Kanhmun - Tuilutkawn (M2) corridor
passes through Dampa Tiger Reserve towards its southern end for nearly 10 km, it is
su.ggested that Type Ill treatment that envisages building the road subgrade upwards
be avoided in this section of M2. This is reflected in the ERMP. Moreover, the Zobawk -
Haulawng road (M6) is being converted from its current earthen condition to a
blacktopped road. Therefore, the levels of impact are anticipated to be higher on this
particular stretch. The QA consultants need to be aware of these special
requirements. It is expected that like Phase 1, there will be provision for Environmental
staff as part of the QA consultants' ToR so that these issues are accorded due
importance.
7.8.  CONTRACTORS
Execution of works will be responsibility of the contractor. The contractor will also
implement the nvironmental measures since they are already a part of the BoQ for
Phase IlL. This has been done with a view to ensure that road construction and
environmental management go together. As executioners guided by the EMP and/or
ERMP, Contractors need to be sensitised to the needs of Hill Roads. Though the
individual Contractor's set up will vory, they are expected to have sufficient
environmental input to ensure that works entrusted to them are implemented on the
ground. Civil Engineers with implementation experience on highways, and an
understanding of environmental issues, or better - post-degree qualification in
environmental engineering should provide a continuous expertise with the SC's

Contractor are:
a  Provide key inputn in the development of the Contractors' implementation plan for all
construction activities, including haulage of material to site. adhering to the
requirements of the EMP and getting approval of SC on the same before start of
works.
* Ensure that the regulatory permissions required for the construction equipment,
vehicles and machinery (liv'en in the EMP) have been obtained and are valid at all
times during the execution of the project.
* Identify locations for siting construction camps and other plants, machinery, vehicles
and equipment, as well as locations for storage and disposal of wastes, both from the
construction camps and from the site and obtain approval for the same from the
Environmental Specialist of the SC.
* Detail out site-specific environmental mitigation and enhancement measures based
on sketches provided as part of the EMP and obtain approval of SC for the same.
* Carry out the measurements of environmental mitigation and/or enhancement works
and prepare bills for -he same for approval and payment through the SC's
Environmental Specialist.
* Ensure that the safety of the workers and other site users is not compromised during
construction.
*  Ensure that adequate monitoring facilities are available for collecting samples of all
discharges from the Contractor's plants, equipment and camps.
a Verify the extent of environmental compliance at sites from where the Contractor is
procuring the material - quarries, crushers or even sand and suggest appropriate
mitigation measures, if required.
o Participate in training programmes and assist the PIU in preparing documnentation for
good practices in environmental protection as part of MSRP.
7.9.  MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES
The monitoring plan prepared for Phase 11 focuses on activities that can have
significant environmental impacts and can be controlled with appropriate mitigation
and/or enhancement measures. The results of monitoring will provide important
information regarding the effectiveness of the proposed measures and thus influence
decision-making process. The monitoring includes the use of:
* Visual observations of activities which (can) cause pollution
* Sampling and analysis of air, water or noise levels close to sensitive receptors at regular
specified intervals using methods specified in the EMP.
 Feedback from NGO for IBA's
* Surveying and enumeration of biodiversity

7.10. REPORTING SYSTEM
Reporting system provides the necessary feedback for project management to
ensure quality of the works and that the program is on schedule. The rationale for a
reporting system is based on accountability to ensure that the measures proposed as
part of the Environmental Management Plan get implemented in the project.
Reporting system for the suggested monitoring program operates at two levels as:
* Reporting for environmental condition indicators and environmenitril management
indicators
*  Reporting for operational performance indicators at the PIU level.
The reporting system will operate linearly with the contractor reporting to the
Supervision Consultant, who in turn shall report to the Project Director. All reporting by
the Supervision Consultant shall be on a quarterly basis. The MPWD shall be
responsible for preparing targets. for each of the identified EMP activities.  All
subsequent reporting by the contractor shall be monitored as per these targets set by
the MPWD before the contractors move on to the site. The reporting by the
Contractor will be monthly report like report of progress on construction and will form
the basis for monitoring by the MPWD, either by its own Environmental cell or the
Environmental Specialist hired by the Supervision Consultant.
Along with these reports, NGO shall report progress of plantation and survival rate as
per the monitoring plan. Table 7.1 summarises the monitoring and reporting
arrangements. Individual formats are given in Annexure 7.1

7.11. ENVIRONMENTAL CAPACITY BUILDING WITHIN MPWD
The preparation of two phases of MSRP and the training programmes that have been
organised during this period have sensitised members of the PIU and many key MPWD
officials to environmental issues in the project. Targeted training modules and a clear
setting of priorities by the PIU have been the key to success of the training so far. This
needs to be built upon during the course of remainder of the MSRP so that the MPWD
benefits from the expertise acquired by its staff well beyond the completion of MSRP.
The focus of future training programmes has to be on implementation. Since project
preparation is drawing to a close, the MPWD officials can concentrate on
simultaneous progress of Phase I and 11. The proposed training should allow the officials
to enhance their skills for effective nmonitoring of project by understanding the formats
developed for reporting. Issues that the training can cover include the stability of
slopes, their protection using civil engineering structures as well as bioengineering
techniques, biodiversity and its protection, etc. For the former, on-site training such as
in Nepal can be considered .^vhile for the latter training can be sourced from the
biodiversity centre being planned in Imphal for the Northeast region.
In addition, close interaction is required among members of the PIU responsible for the
Environmental and R&R activities since it is envisaged that the two aspects will have a
considerable overlap. It is envisaged that the training as part of MSRP will include
training on several issues important for both teams simultaneously. The following
modules (Table 7-2) are to be undertaken as part of MSRP Phase Il:

Mizoram State Roads Project Phase-ll
EIA for P1.B Annexures. June 2003
Annexure 3.1
LUNGLEI - BUANGPUI SECTION. PROJECT PROPOSAL PIB
A. General Observations:
This section was inspected on 18/01/03 and the allied stretches on 17/01 & 19/01. The subject
stretch represents basically an old PWD alignment to be widened and improved upon under
present project proposal. This stretch is an old road bench and appears to be perceptibly in a
stabilised state. Some sporadic distress points viz... road cuts exhibiting mini to macro
collapses on both uphill & downhill faces with slope at locations quite steep. However, these
do not look to be immediately vulnerable.
It is to be emphasized on the basis of observations & the expert views, that the route
alignment in the section of P1B from km 111 km to 165 km do suggest at the various
elevations of the present line, existence of hill cover material in a coherent and cohesive
matrix and thus in a stable state even considering the minor variations in any natural soil /
weathered rock / rock materials.
Thus, the scale of protection works envisaged in the DPR in this stretch may be considered as
all that not essentially implemental. While it is admitted, the knowledge of the actual status
demanding immediate implementation of protective action in the scale and stretch, can be
better known during execution & implementation phase, it is possible to allot the estimated
funds to be expended in stages (subject to acceptability of the funding system) say 60/70 p.c.
during major implementation and next 30-40 pc in next 2-3 years during the road service is
fully open to public.
The project proposal P1 B have identified the engineering needs and have identified in a table
the needs of Retaining Walls with brief details of heights and lengths. But during inspection
the necessities of such elaborate proposal could not apparently be quite appreciated without a
specific and detailed road - log of the observations, the existing cuts & slopes of down hill
positions with re - entrant locations and culvert inlets outlets.
Further, it is to be borne in mind that during actual implementation with the local re-alignment,
local re- curving local re-grading and widening several newer features would be revealed.
Effects of these new features at some locations could be favourable and at some other
locations unfavourable. Thus the scope of this proposal would desirably elect to provide some
specific broad directions for implementation (for the PMC & the authority) as to expend the
allotted of quantities of the protection works in a more clever manner, say, 60 pc as planned
and 40 pc. Thereafter as the stretch reveals itself and the requirements identified.
In this regard attention is further drawn to one specific item like 8.0 m to 12.0 m high retaining
walls (RCC) with presumably wide bases. The modes of its footing excavation, backfilling etc

may be specifically directed for guidance keeping in view to the practicability or the practical
limitations in the formation of hill road benches with appropriate level of stability.
B. OBSERVATIONS Specifically Connected to Certain Locations
The Recee Notes on the Route from Lunglei to Buangpui section (P1B) is enclosed. Cut
faces on uphill faces generally exhibit light yellow colour exhibiting cohesive character, with
often relatively high silt content. Mostly cut depths range between 2m to 3 m with higher
depths of cuts occurring infrequently in between. The sights of these old cuts appear to be
broadly stable with quite occasional failures with small stretches (3 m to 6m). When the cut
occurs in weathered rocks, highly weathered rocks, scree materials, the stability generally is
found in order with some failures, when the disposition or orientation of bedding planes and/or
joint planes is unfavourable. The failure in scree material depends upon the strength &
character of the matrix materials. Mostly the derived products as observed in this stretch being
cohesive, exhibit coherent faces and generally stable for the exposed heights, despite high silt
content.
In the above general and local scenario, this route length may be considered as it is, in a
better status compared to the stretch under PlA. However several specific cases are revealed
in Recce Route Logs; some of them are elaborated.
Recee Notes are not to be considered as exhaustive, but provides keynotes for the scale of
the problem in this stretch. Observations in the enclosed notes may be read in conjunction
with the following.
Km 163 +270
Friable thinly bedded shale is slowly eroded after weakening of the joint planes on exposures.
Elaborate protection system could be developed at prohibitive expenses. Instead a dwarf
height protection, say 2m high breast wall with mortar & weep holes appears to be an
optimum solution.
Similar specific cases are to be decided following detailed guidance from PCC und6r
PMC/Authority for the contractor's implementation.
Km 161 + 100
To the extent the stated weakness is perceptible, the protection work may cover another 1.5
m / 2.0 m in height and 2.0 m / 3.0 m on lateral extend to contain the problem.
Similar cases to be identified and implementation action as mentioned earlier taken say at km
160 + 910.
Km 159 + 100
This specific case has potential problem. Matrix being of incoherent character, stepped cuts
(in heights) protected with breast walls (banded with mortar) in filled with inverted filter (when
required with Geo-textiles) giving an average slope of 70° or so could be considered.

Widening of the existing culvert with u/s face organized, reset to arrest boulder rolling, but
permitting small gravels, pebbles etc running down with water flow during monsoon. The case
demands specific observation and guidance using rock fall barrier and / or enlarging size &
length of culvert.
Km 151 + 773
The downhill steep faces around culvert outlet are to be protected for long serviceability of the
road turning. Uphill boulder arrestor wall, if required, to be strengthened and/or additional
energy absorbing arresting blocks at several uphill stream location may be considered, after
detailed inspection.
Km 148 + 700
Properly designed breast walls, in 2/3 stage heights in a stepped back pattern may be
considered with longitudinal drains at each stage height/stepped back location.
Km 142 + 600
Problematic case: Well planned stepped back cut to be formed and protected with Breast
Walls having horizontal face also protected and fitted with longitudinal drains with possibly
sealing course to avoid running water ingress behind the breast wall.
Retaining walls as appropriate to protect the down hill faces of Hume pipe outlet. Hume pipe
junctions (typically vulnerable for movement and leakages) are to be well detailed out for
execution.
Km 138 + 560
Low height breast wall protection with dowel anchors and drainage holes is one option.
Alternatively proper cut of road drains (uphill side) backed with medium height breast wall (3
m - 4 m), adequate weep holes, gaps filled with drainage blanket may be considered.
Km 132
Depending on the condition of the face, breast walls of proper design with heights 2 m - 3 m
in massive exposure with joints unfavourable; heights 3 m - 5 m in not so massive exposure
with less coherent joints; stepped back walls with intermediate drains etc. in scree materials
are to be properly developed, based on local features and geometry.
Km 113 + 680
Careful cleaning of a part of uphill zone to avoid lubricating effect of joint planes during
monsoon and provision of cut off drain, followed with breast wall on the down slope with weep
holes etc for a stretch of say 1 5m / 20- m may be considered. If cleaning of bushes exposures
higher degree of problematic zone, stepped back geometrics as mentioned earlier may be
considered.

AMiZorom State Roods Project Phase-ll
EIA for P 18. Annexures. June 2003
Annexure 6.1
1. Lessons Learnt from Phase - I implementation
Implementation of MSRP - I is under progress of which environmental
management plan is an integral part. Feedbock from the implementatik':
authorities on the EMP provides valuable inputs into formulation of the EMP for
subsequent phases. Various issues, have been studied for implementation
aspects of the measures suggested. The feedback received is presented in the
following sections.
1.1 Issues on implementation of environmental mitigation
measures
Environmental mitigation measures suggested in the EMP are being
implemented during the construction of Phase - I roads. The aspects that came
to light during implementation and which need to be addressed during the
course of construction and in preparation of EMP for subsequent phases are
presented in the following sections.
1.1.1 Contractor's EMP
Apart from the EMP prepared during project design, contractor prepares an EMP
after review of the document and field verification. During this phase, due to
lack of enough environmental expertise with the contractor the EMP prepared is
not implementable. The supervision consultants had to intervene in its
preparation by giving him guidance and prepare a draft on his behalf.
1.1.2 Spoil Disposal
This aspect is given greater emphasis in the EMP and accordingly during
construction. The engineer has also formulated a spoil disposal strategy.
Locations suitable for reuse of the spoil are identified and accordingly
agreements are made for disposal. The spoil is mostly being reused for
landscaping.
Due to narrow access at some locations, especially at Sialsuk bypass, spillage of
soil is unstoppable. The cut heights being higher than those reachable by
excavators, spoil benches are being used to reach the full cut height. Hence the
machinery cannot be adopted for stopping the spillage.

1.1.3 Water management
Water harvesting structures are proposed for construction to augment the
construction water requirement of the contractor and also not to interfere with
the sources of community water supply. The structures are intended for use of the
community after construction. However, since the contractor has sourced water
from a greater distance where quantity avoilable is higher, there is no
interference with the community water sources. The budget for these structures
as per estimates of the engineer is limited and hence these have not been
implemented. Implementation of these measures would entail issuing a variation
order for the works.
1.1.4 Worker's safety
The engineer and the contractor prepared a safety plan. The safety plan
included provision of personal protective equipment for the contractor's staff
and also erection of safety signage. However, there is non-compliance of the
contractor on implementation of the safety plan. The reason for non-compliance
as reported by the engineer being, lack of awareness of the labour in complying
with the safety plan. There is lack of communication between the contractor
and labour on enforcement of the safety obligations.
1.1.5 Bio-Engineering
Bioengineering measures for slope protection works have received considerable
attention of the engineer and the contractor. Simple bioengineering techniques
as planting of grass, bamboo and other local shrubs are being taken up with the
participation of the villagers. A variation order is being issued to carry out the
works.
The contractor could not carry out more diverse and site-specific bioengineering
techniques, as enough attention to the detail is seldom possible. However,
training for implementation staff for bioengineering can give exposure to the
techniques available and will need to be applied in the post - construction
stage. -
1.1.6 Quarrying operations
The contractor has not submitted quarry area redevelopment; operation and
closure plan are to the engineer. The contractor has also not produced any
licenses for the quarries being used. Apart from these, site preparation for the
Original Document by Icr & CES

EIA for PIS Annexures. June 2003
crusher plant and haul roads is very poor. Hence more stringent codes of
practice are to be formulated for enforcement of environmental safeguards and
management of quarry operations.
1.1.7 Air Quality
Air quality management at construction sites as well as crusher sites is poor. There
is inadequate sprinkling of water and is causing extreme discomfort to the
roadside dwellers as well as travelers. The problem is compounded during dry
season and with the falling debris from construction operations. Water sources
being at a considerable distance and being expensive, this measure is not being
implemented as envisaged. Water being scarce and expensive and also in the
dry season dust suppression by water being short lived; alternative dust
suppressants are being explored. Engineering budget is to provide higher
amount for dust suppression by water or provide for alternative dust
suppressants.
1.1.8 Traffic management
A traffic management plan has been prepared by the contractor and is being
implemented. The plan includes appropriate signage at construction sites and
traffic diversions are also planned.
1.1.9 Bio-diversity
The engineer has prepared a working paper and a briefing indicating need for
conservation, measures to be taken and specifications for the same.
Implementation of the measures for protection of endangered flora is to be
initiated. Provision of additional culverts for Chinese Pangolin is disregarded
during implementation due to the concerns: a) extent of utilisation of culverts by
Pangolin for crossing the road b) high frequency of culverts already present in
the region in question c) existing culverts being large enough for the Pangolin d)
Absence of specific design of culvert for Pangolin to cross and e) Unknown
crossing locations.
1.1.10 Construction camp
Though a construction camp is set up with the envisaged facilities, these are not
maintained. Solid waste management, sanitary arrangement and oil/fuel
spillage cleansing mechanisms are not operational. However, disposal of solid
waste and hazardous waste through burying is taking place.

1.2 Issues on implementation of environmental enhancement
measures
Environmental enhancement measures as enhancement of waterfall locations
are not being implemented due to limited budget provided. The engineer is
unable to judge the extent of works involved, as the enhancement drawings
provided are generic. The engineer expressed concerns.on the residual impacts
of enhancement measures on slope stability and traffic flows. Proposals are
being worked out to work out enhancement measures on a lesser scale than
those proposed in EMP. Variation orders are being sought for inclusion in the
contract.
1.3 Issues on training of environmental staff
Two training sessions are conducted by the PIU for the implementation staff. In
further requirements of training, it is necessary for the PIU to have exposure in
institutional arrangements for effective implementation of EMP. An internal
seminar with an external trainer is identified to be effective means of undertaking
the training. Budgetary provisions for training have been generous and would be
utilised partially.
1.4 Issues on implementation of EMP
1.4.1 Integration of EMP
The EMP has not been included in the contract during Phase I. Some of the
mitigation measures are included in the contract's BoQ and Specifications but
for others as fencing of biodiversity areas and for other amenities are not
included in the main contract. Hence for implementation these measures,
variation orders are to be issued. However, the contractor being an ISO 9002
registered company has obligations to fulfil towards environmental mitigation.
The EMP being prepared stage wise, including pre-construction and operation
stages, it is leading to confusion for integration into the contract documents.
Hence the works involved in construction stage are to be clearly specified with
the construction drawings and specifications.
1.4.2 Supervision and monitoring
The expertise required for monitoring of air, noise, water, biodiversity and
bioengineering measures is expensive in case of Mizoram and in most of the
Originol Document by ICT & CES
Revised and Updaoed by LASA 



MizorOm Stote Roods Project Phase-II
EIA for PIS, Annexures. June 2003
cases it is not available in the North-east states. Equipment haulage costs are
also high. The State Pollution Control Board has a laboratory and few trained
staff but lacks air-sampling equipment. Hence it was felt prudent to utilize the
EMP funds for procurement of necessary equipment and have a tie up with the
SPCB towards monitoring of air, noise and water sampling. An outline of
agreement for mcnitoring works between PIU and SPCB is prepared. No
monitoring has been carried out in the construction sites to date.
Biodiversity monitoring is suggested by the EMP to serve as a databank for
understanding the impacts the construction may have on the biodiversity. Since
the methodology used for pre-project assessment of biodiversity is 'Quadrant'
method, construction stage monitoring with the same methodology will yield
comparable results. However, with the concerns expressed over validity and use
of monitored data, biodiversity monitoring is not undertaken.
1.4.3 Reporting of implementation
Apart from the mechanism suggested in the EMP for implementation, the
Supervision consultant has prepared guidelines for the engineer's site staff. The
guidelines include purpose of EMP implementation and the role of Supervision
consultant. It also includes a checklist of items to be reported, the frequency and
necessary formats for reporting. Reporting system provided in the EMP is slightly
modified and is elaborated further. However, the reporting system is limited to
the communication between site staff and supervision consultant's head office.
Reporting to the PIU is only in the form of progress reports and interim reports.

Annexure 6.4
instructions for rehabilitation of Quarry and Borrow areas
*   The objective of rehabilitation programme is to return the quarry /borrow pit sites into a
safe and secure area, which the general public should be able to safely enter and enjoy.
Securing borrows pits/quarry sites in a stable condition should be a fundamental
requirement of the rehabilitation process. This could be achieved by filling the quarry /
borrow pit floor to approximately the access road level.
*   It is important to plan restoration from the outset and coordinate restoration with
quarrying activities. In addition to the bio-diversity issues, land planning considerations are
also taken into account when defining a rehabilitation project in order both to preserve
the environment and to generate income for the local communities. In this framework,
quarry rehabilitation often leads to the creation of wetlands and natural reserves or
recreation areas.
*   Special quarry/borrow pit rehabilitation plan called 'landscape plan' should be specified
accord:;-,g to the location and shaping of the mining slopes after exploitation and
overburdened dump, with different subsequent uses e.g. forest. meadow, reserve for
special and endangered species of animals and plants, wetlands etc.. the re-greening
and replanting methods. This rehabilitation plan with focus on bio-diversity should be
worked out in co-operation with nature protection experts.
Other criteria, which should be followed for rehabilitation of quarry/borrow pits, are
given below:
*   Quarries and borrow pits will be backfilled with rejected construction wastes and will be
given a vegetative cover. If this is not possible. then the excavation slopes will be
smoothed and depression will be filled in such a way that it looks more or less like the
original ground surface.
*   During works execution, the contractor shall ensure preservation of trees during piling of
materials; spreading of stripping material to facilitate water percolation and allow natu(al
vegetation growth; reestablishment of previous natural drainage flows; improvement of
site appearance: digging of ditches to collect runoff; and maintenance of roadways
where a pit or quarry is declared useable water source for livestock or people nearby.
Once the works are completed. the contractor shall restore at his own expense. the
environment around the work site to its original splits.
*   To create a safe environment under the terms of The Mines and Quarries Act, the faces
have to be reduced to a naturally stable slope or be adequately fenced to prevent
access to the top and bottom of the faces. Such a fence must be of a height as
prescribed under The Mines Act with a barbed wire top strand designed to exclude the
public from the quarry area. Depending on the location of the site, presence of a
permanent lake is considered to be a satisfactory alternative to a fence.
*   Appropriate plant species for the planting programme have to be selected in
consultation with ecological consultant and local forest department. Depending on the
limitations on the availability of appropriate plant material, harsh growing conditions flack
of irrigation and hot :rnmer) and ongoing quarry rehabilitation operations there may be

substantial loss of plantation and the planting programme may have to be continued for
over 3-5 years.  AS plantings are progressively established, they should be monitored
before undertaking the next stage to ensure maximumn plant survival rates.
*   The quarry or borrow pit immediate surroundings should be developed as a low
maintenance reserve, with significant areas of native trees and shrubs and areas of
longer grass and tussocks forming the open spaces. Walkways around the borrow site
must be constructed. Provision for a future drive-in picnic area and car-parking area may
be developed.
