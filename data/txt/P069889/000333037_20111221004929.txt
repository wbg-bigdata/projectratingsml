1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 This is the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for the Mizoram State
Roads Project (MSRP). At the time of appraisal in 2001, the Government of India‟s (GOI)
planning and development strategy gave a high priority to the socioeconomic development of the
north eastern part of India. This was because of the sub region‟s geographical remoteness from
the rest of India, hilly topography and long transport logistics links.

1.1.2 The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) program priority for India at that time focused
on strengthening the enabling environment for development and growth through the promotion of
the private sector. The MSRP goal of providing high quality infrastructure and more efficient
management of the road transport sector was thus in line with this CAS. Furthermore, the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) stated that the project should facilitate greater private sector led
growth in Mizoram through reducing the constraints that poor transport infrastructure has
imposed on the state‟s socioeconomic development.

1.1.3 Mizoram‟s state road network of 6,840 km of single lane roads (largely unpaved)
provided the only means of transport for goods and people within the state. Most of the roads
were structurally weak. Poor road quality and inadequate capacity provided a low level of service
to road users who endured inadequate riding quality, slow travel speeds (10-15 km/hr.) and high
vehicle operating costs. Since access to a reliable transportation network is a precondition for a
competitive economy, at both regional and national levels, it was not surprising that the Mizoram
development agenda attached an overriding importance to improving the road network to
facilitate access to all parts of the state and beyond.

1.1.4 GOM was at the time of appraisal also participating in several centrally supported
development programs targeting improvements in rural road connectivity, but assistance from the
GOI, international financial institutions and other partners was constrained by Mizoram‟s weak
institutional capacity to develop and implement a large program of high value road investments.
The MSRP therefore focused on the institutional strengthening of the sector with the aim of
improving its planning and implementation capacity, and on ensuring sufficient funding to tackle
the large maintenance backlog and the significant investments required for the rehabilitation and
expansion of the network.

1.2     Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The project development objective (PDO) of the project as stated in the (Project
Appraisal Document) PAD and the Credit Agreement was to improve the management and
carrying capacity of the Mizoram core state road network. Achievement of the PDO was to be
confirmed through the following project development indicators:

(a)     Travel time on improved sections reduced by 30 percent by end of project (EOP);
(b)     increase in the portion of core state road network in good condition from International
        Roughness Index (IRI) < 4m/km from zero to 50 percent by EOP;
(c)     EERs as per appraisal estimates;
(d)     Periodic maintenance backlog decreased from about 1,000km of core road network to
        about 250 km by EOP; and
(e)     PWD administrative costs reduced to 20 percent of road sector budget by EOP.



                                                1
1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO and indicators were not revised during the project implementation, although the
physical targets of phase II for Road Maintenance/Rehabilitation works component was dropped.
The curtailment of the civil works scope was acknowledged by the Bank‟s supervision/Mid Term
Review (MTR) mission (re: Aide-Memoire, Jan 16-28, 2004), but since the PDO remained valid
no restructuring of the project was undertaken until the second additional credit (Sep. 1, 2010).
Hence, only one performance indicator was revised.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary beneficiaries of the project were the road users who benefited from the
improved quality of the core road network in the state. At the time of appraisal, the project had
estimated their number at around 70 percent of the state‟s inhabitants. Another beneficiary of the
project was the PWD. The department was to benefit from strengthened institutional capacity to
more effectively manage its state road assets.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1   The MSRP comprised six components:

Component 1- Improvement of about 184 km of state highways (total cost includes
contingencies: US$39.00 million

1.5.2 This component was to help increase the carrying capacity and structural strength of part
of the core State Road Network (SRN) through widening, strengthening, and new construction
(Aizawl bypass) of about 184 km of state roads in two phases: (phase I: 99 km estimated of
US$20.46 million, Phase II: 85 km estimated of US$18.54 million).

Component 2 - Land acquisition, Implementation of the Resettlement and Indigenous
Peoples Development Plan (R&IPDP), Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and utility relocation for civil works
components: US$ 2.25 million

1.5.3 This land acquisition (estimated to US$0.67 million) and cash compensation (about
US$0.47 million) paid under the project as part of the Borrower‟s contribution.

Component 3 - Rehabilitation/maintenance of about 520 km of state roads (total cost includes
contingencies) US$18.75 million.

1.5.4 This component will help reduce the periodic maintenance backlog of the State by
funding the overlaying, resealing, and minor rehabilitation of about 520 km of key State roads in
two phases. (Phase I: 278 km estimated to US$10.26, and Phase II: 240 km estimated to US$8.49
million).




                                                2
Component 4 - Design, supervision, and technical advisory services for civil works (total cost
includes contingencies): US$6 million)

1.5.5 Project Coordinating Consultant (PCC) will be retained to assist GOM in implementing
the project Technical Advisory Consultants (TAC) will also be used to help GOM implement the
rehabilitation/maintenance component (phase I and II), focusing on quality control.

Component 5 - Institutional strengthening including equipment, technical assistance, training,
and pre-investment studies: US$3 million

1.5.6 This component was to help implement the Institutional Action Plan (ISAP). This
included improved coordination between government agencies and other parties, streamlining of
overhead costs and improvement of PWD‟s capability to manage the Mizoram road network
including the implementation of a comprehensive road management system (RMS)

Component 6 - Road safety engineering measures and the implementation of a road
safety plan: US$1 million

This component includes: (a) the provision of safety-related furniture on both the roads that are
being improved and rehabilitated/maintained; and (b) the implementation of a road safety action
plan. This component also fund minor works and road safety furniture for identified accident
spots on other State roads.

1.6     Revised Components

1.6.1 The work scope had to be curtailed for the Rehabilitation and Maintenance Component,
dropping the phase II from this component from 520 km originally envisaged to 297 km due to
higher unit costs during implementation when compared to the appraisal estimate. This action
was necessitated to cope with the funding shortfall and implementation delays. Although this
decision was undertaken during the Midterm review (MTR), January 2004, there was no formal
restructuring until much later with the second additional financing (September 2010). Hence, the
performance of this component is measured against the revised target.

1.7     Other significant changes

1.7.1 Scope of works: At MTR stage (January 2004), the maintenance component of the project
was reduced to 297 km mostly limited to the roads covered under Phase 1. The remaining length
was removed from the project in view of the increased costs of the civil works, and the possibility
of including the outstanding 223 km of roads needing maintenance in other GOI funded programs.

1.7.2 Fund Allocation: Originally, a Credit of US$ 60 million was approved in February 2002.
The project was later granted additional financing of US$18 million in January 2007 under the
same Credit to finance the costs associated with cost overrun due to higher cost of works and
construction materials, such as bitumen, steel and cement. This additional amount turned out to
be insufficient and a second additional financing allocation in the amount of US$13 million under
a second additional Credit was approved in September 2010 mainly due to price escalation arising
from further delays, additional quantities, and extra cost of engineering supervision. Hence the
final credit disbursement amount allowing for the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar was
(as of June 1, 2011) US$ 103.00 million.




                                                3
1.7.3 Time Period: The original Credit closing date was extended by a total of 36 months (18
months in December 2007, two interim extensions totaling six months in June and October 2009
and 12 months in December 2010). The implementation arrangements remained unchanged.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Project Preparation. The project design incorporated lessons learned from earlier Bank
road sectors operations. Typical lessons covered the need for quality preparation to ensure
satisfactory quality at entry; the need for strong client ownership and good interdepartmental
cooperation; involvement of key stakeholders; encouragement of the development and
modernization of local contractors; the importance of sustained funding for maintenance; and site
readiness for timely implementation of the civil works contracts.

2.1.2 Design: The engineering designs for the upgrading component prepared by the consultant
had to be reworked substantially during the construction phase resulting in significant time and
cost overruns. Issues included a lack of competition in the contracting industry, poor quality of
engineering designs and major delays in the implementation of the works. The project
significantly underestimated the physical and price contingencies (which were reportedly pegged
at only two percent in each case to fit within the available IDA credit envelope), and this partly
explained the need for subsequent additional financing. Although the need for implementing
institutional strengthening measures cannot be overstated, the project design ambitiously, but
unrealistically, given the known weaknesses in capacity, called for the rapid expansion of the
institutional capacity for contract and project management in line with the scheduled pace of
project implementation. Specific measures to be undertaken in respect of building such capacity
and also in assisting in the modernization of the local contracting industry which was relatively
inexperienced were not followed through. On the other hand the project did benefit from
accumulated experience in previous projects and took steps to ensure improved quality control
measures were built into the design.

2.1.3 Participatory Processes: The project was prepared and implemented in a participatory
manner according to plan with extensive involvement of key stakeholders, including local and
district government units, community leaders, trucking associations, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and project affected people including farmers, villagers and roadside
residents. The consultation process utilized a range of formal and informal tools including in-
depth interviews, village meetings, workshops and even door-to-door individual contacts. At the
local and state levels, public meetings were held regularly to explain the project to stakeholders
and elicit their views.

2.1.4 Risks and Mitigation Measures: A large array of risks was identified and mitigation
measures proposed during the preparation phase. The overall project risk rating was „substantial‟
and an above average supervision effort was planned in the early phase of implementation.
However, the design consultant performed poorly overlooking some project specific risks; in
particular, the significant risks associated with preparation of quality hill road designs.
Consequently a significant portion of the civil works had to be redesigned leading to project
delays. The risk mapping did not spell out some other key risks associated with civil works
construction in the local environment, namely, availability of suitable construction material, the
relatively small window for physical construction during the year, a long material and equipment
supply chain, environmental risks associated with fragile geological exposed cut surfaces, and the



                                                4
sequencing of physical works across components. However, all such risks should have been
managed by a competent contractor.

2.1.5 Quality at Entry: No quality at entry assessment of the project was carried out by the
Quality Assurance Group.

2.2     Implementation

2.2.1      The implementation of this Project proved a huge challenge for the implementing
agency for this rather complex project, all the way from designs to construction completion. The
procurement of civil works and mobilization of contractors was significantly delayed while,
staffing of executing agency, supervision and contracts management was below the required level,
The implementation progress ratings given by the respective supervision review missions (in
ISRs) varied between Satisfactory (2002-2004), to moderately unsatisfactory (2005) to
moderately satisfactory (2006-2009) and then satisfactory in the last phase (2010). The Project
experienced delays for the reason mentioned above and below. The following were the main
factors affected implementation of the project:

(a)     Technically Deficient Road Design: The Engineering designs prepared by the consultant
        for the Phase I for the improvement component were assessed to be deficient on the
        ground which was not pointed out early enough before commencement of
        implementation. One reason was that the designs were partly based on visual
        observations and not on actual measurements based on the field conditions. The design
        consultant did very little to remedy some of the many design issues that arose during
        construction of works. Furthermore, the design and supervision consultant were split and
        this created issues of coordination/continuity.
(b)    Implementation Causing Delays and Cost Overruns: (i) Slow mobilization of contractors,
        plant, staff, equipment; (ii) poor implementation performance of the contractors; (iii)
        termination of Phase I ICB contract, with about 20 percent of the works completed; (iv)
        rebidding and awarding the Phase I ICB to three NCB contracts; (iv) heavy and longer
        than normal monsoon period lasting over five months; (v) limited availability of good
        quality natural aggregates for road construction; (vi) lack of skilled manpower; (vii)
        shortage and disruptions of major commodities such as bitumen, oil, cement, steel and
        diesel fuel; and (viii) no diverted traffic during construction.
(c )    Project Management Issues: (i) Weak PIU capacity to monitor and supervise closely the
        consultants and contractors; (ii) lack of qualified PIU staff; (iii) lack of coordination with
        the field staff, inability to take timely actions with respect to poorly performing works
        contracts; and (iv) lack of adequate quality control over site works. However, the limited
        PIU staff did their best efforts to run and complete the Project.
(d)     Contract Management Issues: (i) inadequate contractor capacity; (ii) poor contract
        planning and monitoring; and (iii) insufficient plant, equipment and manpower at the
        sites.
(e)     Procurement and Contract arrangements: (i) lack of competition due Mizoram
        environment difficulties.

2.2.2 Midterm Review: At the MTR, 30 months after the project effectiveness (June 3, 2002),
most of the civil works contracts were running behind schedule. The MTR took note of the slow
pace of implementation, the increased costs of civil works, and the need for additional counterpart
funds, as well as a plan to fund the maintenance and rehabilitation of Phase II roads. It expressed
concern at the slow progress of all four civil works contracts, and in particular the Phase I road



                                                 5
improvement contract that had been awarded 18 months earlier, but in which physical progress, at
the time of the MTR, was only 7.5 percent.

2.2.3 Project at Risk Status and Actions Taken: A formal restructuring was approved through
the second additional financing on September 1, 2010 to: (i) help finance the completion of the
main road improvements due to price escalation arising from delays, additional quantities, and
extra cost of international engineering supervision consultants, and institutional development
initiatives; and (ii) exclude the Phase II of the Rehabilitation and Maintenance component.

2.2.4 The project delays had another significant side effect, as the project supervision costs
increased sharply, largely because of the format of the time-based contracts. As per the final
figures, the supervision costs were nearly 35 percent of the civil works costs. The effectiveness of
the consultants in providing the professional services remained questionable and the inability of
the consultants to timely position adequate and skilled supervisory staff was an important
deficiency. Despite these challenges, however, the quality of permanent works pavement at
project closure was generally satisfactory.

2.2.5 The ISAP component aimed to implement organizational reforms leading to enhanced
capacity to render PWD‟s services efficiently and economically. Some significant milestones
defining road sector strategy were achieved early on in project implementation. Chief amongst
these was the promulgation of Mizoram Highway Act (2002), GOM endorsement of the Road
Development Policy (2002), and preparation of the Rural Roads Master plan. GOM constituted
an Institutional Strengthening Group (ISG) with the responsibility of mainstreaming the ISAP
process across PWD. This step helped to achieve greater ownership. PWD gained substantially
from these reforms and established procurement, contract management and management
information systems. It is now independently able to plan and monitor similar programs of
comparable size. Planning and Quality Assurance Units were established and made functional,
while selected offices in Aizawl acquired ISO 9001 certification in 2010. Environmental and
social policies and guidelines were finalized and adopted organization-wide by PWD. Though not
yet operational, GOM passed the “Mizoram Road Fund Rule? in 2010. Mobilizing sufficient
maintenance funds had previously been hampered by the limited tax base of the state and reliance
on federal government assistance to maintain the network. The Government has not increased
funding for maintenance at their end though some additional funds have been allocated through
the grant under the 12th and 13th Finance Commissions. The actual expenditure on road
maintenance is not more than 35 percent of the requirement resulting in rising backlog of roads
requiring maintenance. This shortfall put a question mark on the sustainability of the assets
financed by the Bank.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation, Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design: The overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) function was the
responsibility of PWD. The project included performance monitoring indicators to monitor
progress and the extent of achievement of the PDO during implementation. The design made
provision that PWD would be assisted by consultants in various aspects of data collection. The
institutional strengthening component was monitored through progress defined by ISAP.
However, some monitoring indicators confused inputs with outputs. There were also too many
monitoring indicators given the capacity of the implementing agency.

2.3.2 M&E Implementation: The performance indicators were monitored and evaluated
periodically by the review missions of the Bank in collaboration with the PWD. However, the
ISAP results were monitored poorly or in some cases (such as training days) not at all. The


                                                 6
consultants could have assisted more with M&E. At MTR the maintenance component was scaled
down and the Phase II maintenance activities were excluded. The performance indicators were
not modified at the time of MTR with the exception of the extent of roads to be maintained under
Phase I which was revised downwards by 40 percent.

2.3.3 M&E Utilization: The project monitored indicators for outcomes, intermediate results
and outputs, which included limited baseline data at appraisal. The indicators were sufficiently
appropriate for broad decision making and resource allocation purposes.

2.4        Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

 Environmental and Social Safeguard compliance overall is rated satisfactory with environmental
safeguards being fully satisfactory and social safeguards satisfactory but with qualifications.

2.4.1 The MSRP was classified as environmental category “A? (full assessment) because the
hilly terrain posed issues in respect of erosion, drainage and disposal of spoil, and because the
road corridor passed through an area of rich biodiversity. There were also several social issues
surrounding land acquisition, compensation and relocation of affected people, community land
ownership and land dependency.

2.4.2 Environmental Safeguards: The performance varied during preparation and
implementation of the project from Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory but the overall
rating was satisfactory. Hillside cutting for a major length of the project route posed serious
issues of stability of hill slopes given the immature geology of the project area. Some 40
vulnerable locations prone to landslides, high erosion potential and loss of productive land were
identified. Although “cut and fill? measures utilized 40 percent of the spoil, about 0.7 million
cubic meters of debris still required disposal. For slope protection, a combination of conventional
techniques (such as retaining walls and stone pitching) and bio-engineering techniques (such as
terracing hill slopes with locally available bamboo) was used. Innovative practices were used to
ensure the retention of the hillside biodiversity and improve productivity. There were initial
slippages on implementation of environmental management plans due to capacity limitations and
harsh climatic and geological conditions. However, the PWD has put in relevant measures to
address institutional capacity and implement EMP. The use of bio-engineering practices using the
traditional skills and local material has proved to be the most effective means to protect hill side
and valley slopes. The bio-engineering practices using the traditional skills and local material led
to cost savings and the local communities were supportive because it provided local employment
and strengthened community ownership of the project. 1 Extensive community consultations
proved to be effective in implementing EMP measures such as the creation of construction
exclusion zones to ensure the preservation of local natural resources and areas of special
biodiversity. Communities were also consulted on appropriate sites for the spoil and other debris.
Some soil was compacted and used to establish soccer pitches for the recreation of local residents.
The goodwill thus created was extended further through the creation of small roadside retaining
structures at five sites to provide ponds to give the communities easier access to water. In
addition, the project led to the setting up of an Environmental Management Unit in the PWD,
training of local engineers and the preparation of environmental management guidelines.

    Similar practices have since been adopted in Himachal Pradesh.

2.4.3 Social Safeguards: The total land acquired under the project was 104.97 hectares and
involved 1,717 project affected families (the estimate in the PAD was 1,504). This includes
additional land acquisition of 11,238 m2 to provide adjustments in designs. At appraisal the cost
of land acquisition, compensation and related costs was estimated at US$2.25million. The final
cost was US$3.22 million (increased after the first additional financing). The majority of the
project R&R activity was completed on time (for Phase 1 roads during 2005 and for Phase-II
roads by October 2006). End Term Evaluation of the R&IPDP implementation was completed for
the project in June 2008. Institutional arrangements for R&IPDP implementation were effected as
agreed. NGOs implemented the R&IPDP with the assistance of the PIU. The NGO team
identified for the project during Phase I, however, had to be replaced by another team for Phase II
due to poor performance. As per the end term evaluation report, the timely payment of R&R
assistance and compensation played an important role in the R&IPDP implementation. Project
affected families under both the phases reported in an ex post survey that the
assistance/compensation money was timely (72 percent), and adequate and satisfactory (62
percent).

2.4.4 Construction-Induced Social Impacts: The project had to devote substantial attention to
address the issues of loss of access to properties, and the safety of buildings due to hill excavation
and/or careless dumping downhill resulting in losses of crops and trees. Several complaints were
received by PWD in this regard. Moreover, due to substantial delays in completing the road
works, the construction sites remained open for a much longer duration than anticipated and the
work activities accordingly caused extended inconvenience to roadside inhabitants outlined in
Aide Memoirs and M&E study.

2.4.5 An initial HIV/AIDS awareness program planned as part of the R&IPDP received a
positive reception locally, and accordingly a second HIV/AIDS awareness campaign with a wider
sweep was carried out at an additional cost of US$0.6 million. The project was also able to
highlight the dangers to society of drug trafficking, cognizant of the project‟s proximity to the
international drug trade axis.

2.4.6 The social aspects, though satisfactory in the end are qualified because of the problems in
execution. The R&R took longer and cost more than planned. The first NGO implementation
team had to be replaced. Of persons surveyed nearly 30 percent thought the compensation was
not timely and nearly 40 percent complained about the amount of compensation. The overall
status of environmental and social safeguards at project closure was reasonably satisfactory with
no critical issues pending, but some areas were flagged where procedures could be further
improved over time. Safeguard compliance benefitted from robust design and supervision and
went beyond mere compliance through listening to and then assisting the affected communities
with small low cost projects. A key area that needed improvement as the project evolved was
planning suitable protection measures for the construction site prior to the monsoon rains. In the
early years of the project, inadequate preventative measures led to erosion, silting and slope
failures, but with more experience and using temporary drainage, greater slope protection and
removal of unsafe debris, the effects of the monsoons were reduced.

Fiduciary compliance is considered Satisfactory as explained below:

2.4.7 Financial Management: Is rated Satisfactory. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
appointed a qualified chartered accountant (CA) in May 2002 and the PIU operated a separate
bank account for the project and maintained its books according to commercial principles.
Submissions of quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports introduced from 2007 onwards were
regular although there were some delays in submitting them to the Bank. Adequate funds were


                                                  8
made available to the project by the state government through the budget and regular claims were
submitted for reimbursement. Annual project audits by the Auditor-General were regular and the
audit reports were then submitted to the Bank, albeit with some delays. However there were
persistent delays in the settlement of audit observations for the project. A risk-based internal audit,
aimed at strengthening internal controls, was introduced from March 2009. While there are no
serious pending internal audit objections, some suggestions by the internal auditors for further
strengthening internal control arrangements remained on paper due to delays as the project neared
closure. After the approval of the first additional financing, use of standardized off-the-shelf
accounting software (Tally) to overcome the inadequacies of the PWD-developed project
financial management software (FMS) was implemented.

2.4.8 At MTR, the issue of inadequate documentation related to R&R disbursement was
highlighted. A detailed post verification of project affected persons undertaken in July 2006
indicated gaps in documentation, but no financial anomalies were detected. The project
subsequently improved its R&R documentation and processes. The project‟s contract
management was weak which contributed to considerable delays in obtaining the Bank‟s no
objections to extension of time and price variations. These delays were repeatedly highlighted by
the Auditor-General‟s audit reports and followed up by the Bank for resolution.

2.4.9 Procurement: Is rated Satisfactory. Procurement of works, goods and consulting
services was carried out generally in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. Overall the
procurement process management was carried out without any irregularities or complaints
concerning procurement cycle management. Initial contracts packaging was kept simple and
geared towards attracting large contractors. At the time, the GOI was encouraging infrastructure
development on a large scale with many huge projects under implementation elsewhere in India,
thereby straining indigenous construction capacity. This in turn limited further the attractiveness
of a remotely located state like Mizoram.

2.4.10 A major works contract was cancelled and rebid by splitting it into three smaller contract
packages. The Bank assisted where it could by encouraging on-the-job procurement training.
Considerable delays in implementation on several contracts inter alia led to additional financing
and two extensions of the project closing date. All participating contractors in Mizoram were
from outside the state and lacked local knowledge, which led to their taking undue risks. The
client, with limited options, often took too lenient a view of implementation shortcomings, and
did not impose the full rigor of contractual conditions. Consultancy services contracts for
supervision were also extended several times. The quality of consultants‟ personnel at times was
inadequate. This affected contract management and preparation of variation proposals and led to
many rounds of unnecessary back and forth negotiations.

2.4.11 Disbursement: Total amount disbursed as of June 1, 2011 was US$103.15 million. This
includes the original credit (US$60 million), first additional financing, (US$18 million), and
second additional financing which became necessary because the first additional financing was
insufficient (US$13 million). The final amount disbursed of US$103.15 million differs from the
amount shown in the Credit Agreement because of a substantial depreciation of the rupee against
the dollar.

2.4.12 Compliance with Legal Covenants: The project fully complied with seven of the ten
agreed covenants. Road surveys and the appointment of a consultant to evaluate the impact of the
R&IPDP were also complied with, but later than the date due. A covenant only partially complied
with was the requirement “to increase funding for maintenance of the core road network so as to
ensure that such funding would cover 80 percent of such norms by June 30, 2007.? Although a


                                                  9
road fund was set up, it is not yet operating. The GOM wished to address this issue through a
third additional financing which the the Bank would not support given that the project has
reached its limit of extensions and closure was imminent.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The upgrading of about 400 km of core road network together with the implementation of
the institutional strengthening component had a positive impact on the state‟s transport network
operations and PWD‟s capacity to manage it. Funding for maintenance received a temporary
boost by way of grants received from the 13th Finance Commission, until the state was able to
improve the maintenance allocation from its own resources and put the road fund into operation.
The GOM is keen to have a follow up operation by the Bank in the transport sector and is in the
process of approaching the GOI in this regard.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation: It is rated Satisfactory as
described below:

3.1.1 The PAD correctly identified the opportunities and constraints of Mizoram‟s situation,
with emphasis on the importance of building up the state government‟s capacity to manage major
infrastructure works, and especially the improvement and rehabilitation of deteriorated roads in
order to support economic growth. The MSRPs goal of providing high quality infrastructure and
more efficient management of the road transport sector was supportive of the CAS for India at the
time. Within this strategy, the project would facilitate higher private sector led growth in
Mizoram through reducing the constraints that poor transport infrastructure places on the state‟s
socioeconomic development. It rightly attached considerable importance to a diagnosis of the
institutional set-up for planning road investments and managing their implementation. The
relevance of the project continued to be valid throughout implementation.

3.1.2 The project design to achieve the PDO underestimated the availability and quality of
local capacity with experience in the difficulties of working in a hilly, high rainfall environment.
It was also vague about specific measures to build capacity and how it would assist in the
modernization of the local contracting industry. Measures were taken, however, to ensure that
implementation would assure good quality controls. Relevance of the PDO was thus substantial,
while that of the design was modest.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives. Overall, it is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory as described below:

3.2.1 The PDO, to improve the management and carrying capacity of the Mizoram core state
road network, is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the analysis of the two sub-objectives
below. Around 98 percent of all project funds went to the civil works and associated design and
supervision services and the final quality of the works was satisfactory, albeit after long delays,
large cost increases and a reduction in scope. This report takes the view that the institutional
components of the project, in the long run, have the potential to lead to a greater impact, and
since their success has been under expectations this aspect must carry a strong weight in this ICR.
The overall assessment is based on the following analysis of achievements:




                                                10
3.2.2 Sub-objective 1: To improve the management of the Mizoram core state road network:
This sub-objective has been partially achieved. The GOM reduced the PWD administrative costs
by about 15 percent of the total of state road sector budget, a substantial improvement on the
target of 20 percent reduction by end of project. The PWD made progress in implementing
organizational reform, preparing a road policy and a road safety action plan, and introducing a
maintenance management system. It now makes decisions based on resource allocation in
accordance with technical and economic reasoning, rather than local politics. It achieved ISO
9001 certification for one of its divisions and intends to scale up to cover the entire department
over the next two years. Furthermore, the PWD is in the process of finalizing an information
technology system to enhance efficiency in its business processes having procured hardware and
software for this purpose. A number of road safety engineering measures have also been
completed. However, the quality of the improvements and the effectiveness of implementation
were not measured.

3.2.3 Although the road fund legislation has been approved by GOM and board members have
been appointed, the fund is not in operation which is a significant shortcoming. The GOM has
been unable to increase funding for sustained maintenance due to lack of fiscal space (even
though some additional funds are becoming available over a four year period through a grant
under the 13th Finance Commission). The actual expenditure on road maintenance is only about
35 percent of the budgetary requirement necessary to keep the roads in good condition and is
resulting in a growing backlog of maintenance needs. This raises doubts concerning the
sustainability of the project investment as well any future investments that are made for the core
road network. In the context of the PDO, the pending decision of the government on whether to
allocate sustained and adequate funding for maintenance is crucial.

3.2.4 Sub-objective 2: To improve the carrying capacity of the Mizoram core state road
network: The sub-objective of improving the carrying capacity of the Mizoram core state road
network was partially achieved. On the positive side, 174 km of state roads were widened and
strengthened against a target of 184 km (95 percent). This led to a reduction in travel time of 65
percent against a target of 30 percent, and substantial savings on road user costs (reflected in a
positive ERR) on these improved portions of the core state road network. Traffic growth on the
project roads upgraded, however, was much higher than anticipated and diverted traffic volumes
were also greater (see Annex 3). This means that maintenance will be required on these roads far
sooner than planned and it is unclear that there will be sufficient available funds for this purpose.

3.2.5 Due to a combination of implementation delays, increases in the global price of inputs
(especially bitumen, steel, diesel fuel and cement), additional quantities and extra supervision
costs, the state road improvement component increased in cost from US$39 million to US$87
million (223 percent). Despite increases in the Credit amount the scope had to be reduced, and
because of the possibility of alternative financing avenues in due course, the maintenance
component of the project was reduced from 518 to 297 km (57 percent of original plans).The
portion of the core state road network in good condition(IRI< 4m/km) increased from zero to 30
percent, against a target of 50 percent, whilst the portion of core state road network in poor
condition (IRI > 12m/km) remained almost static at ten percent, against a target of five percent.

3.3     Efficiency

3.3.1 The efficiency in achieving the PDO is Satisfactory, but with caveats. The ERR at the
ICRR stage for the widening and strengthening component (17 percent) is higher than at the
appraisal stage (15 percent). This is because although the civil works costs more than doubled and,
the time overrun was 56 months (an increase of 198 percent), traffic growth (86 percent) to some


                                                 11
 extent compensated for these deficiencies. However, the highway model assumes that there will
 be additional and timely maintenance to make up for the greater volumes of traffic. Slow progress
 with reducing the maintenance backlog to date and the inability thus far to put the Road Fund into
 operation indicate a serious risk to the achievement of the ERR.

 3.3.2 At appraisal the ERR for the maintenance component was also factored in (but was not
 included in the completion calculation) and only 57 percent of this planned maintenance work
 was actually done. The maintenance component increased the overall ERR at appraisal to 18
 percent. Not surprisingly, the benefit-cost ratio is lower at completion for most of the sections
 where information is available. This is because the marginal decrease in the project cost along
 with the increase in the volume of traffic in the project roads (from a predicted annual average
 growth rate of 8.5 percent at appraisal to an average of 15.4 percent at ICRR stage) has
 counteracted favorably, keeping the ERR above the twelve percent threshold for most links.

 3.3.3 To the extent possible, the same methodology and assumptions used during the appraisal
 stage were used at ICR stage (i.e. in accordance with the Indian Road Congress guideline SP-30),
 but replacing forecasted values with actual values where appropriate. More details of the
 methodology are given in Annex 3 and a summary for the upgrading component is given in Table
 1 below. Assessment of the institutional strengthening aspects of the project was based on outputs,
 but failed to reach the most important goal to put the road fund into operation.

 3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 3.4.1 The overall rating of moderately satisfactory takes into account the substantial relevance
 of the objectives, but modest relevance of design; the shortcomings in the efficacy of the civil
 works (the scope had to be reduced), and modest outcomes of the institutional strengthening in
 respect of resolving the maintenance funding issue; the substantial rating for efficiency is
 qualified by concern that the additional traffic generated will pose future maintenance issues
 which will exacerbate the problem. While the road network is a high economic priority for the
 sector, the institutional components are equally important in terms of longer term development
 impact. Taking into account the delays, cost overruns and reduction of the project scope the
 project overall has some significant shortcomings and cannot be rated as fully satisfactory.




                                                12
3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 There was no study on poverty impacts or gender aspects undertaken during the
preparation of the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 As seen in Section 3.2, achievement of the institutional development sub-objective has
been moderate so far. Among the four main areas – road sector strategy, organizational reforms,
private sector participation, and road finance and maintenance– organizational reforms have had
variable results, and progress of private sector participation, road finance and maintenance has
been weak. The approach of ring has fenced maintenance resources through the creation of a road
fund is faced with the serious challenge of matching credible and sustainable resource inflows in
a state with limited fiscal space. Although there has been positive progress in building capacity to
better handle a similar sized project with similar policy content, there remains scope for further
progress in inter departmental coordination.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3   None identified.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 A meeting was organized at Aizawl on May 20, 2010 to interact with beneficiaries.
Overall, the mainly PWD (no other participants) attendees expressed satisfaction with the
completed operation. However, they raised issues concerning contracting capacity, road safety,
environmental issues, and road management capacity as key factors affecting the sector. Separate
informal interaction with village councils and some prominent residents of Lunglei confirmed a
general feeling of satisfaction with the eventual outcomes.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1.1 The risk that the achieved development outcomes will not be sustained is Moderate. A
concern going forward is the adequacy of the annual road maintenance budget to sustain the state
network in general and the project investments in particular. The state has a core network of
about 1,100 km. The project focused on the improvement and rehabilitation/maintenance of about
520 km (47 percent) subsequently reduced to about 400 km (36 percent). Mizoram‟s annual
maintenance funding on the state road network (project roads included) is about US$7 million
including the salary component of the PWD staff.

4.1.2 With regard to sustaining the institutional reforms, the GOM appears to be committed as
evidenced by its persistence with other adopted sector policies and senior management
understanding of the issues. However, the competing demands on the government have
constrained the allocation of sufficient maintenance resources to ensure long-term sustainability
of the road network.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rated Moderately Satisfactory as
described below:

5.1.1 The quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. This project was the first significant
transport project in one of the least developed, remotest and hilliest regions of India and
considerable progress was made in preparing the officials and stakeholders for what was involved
in taking on a large scale project. Based on state road projects in other parts of India the project
team was able to incorporate into the design well tested approaches involving international best
practice encompassing economic analysis, quality assurance systems, engineering know-how,
public accountability and business practices, procedures and processes. „Soft‟ components were
incorporated into the design to strengthen government organization, and technical and business
capacity for economically sound road planning, budgeting and accountability. Recognizing the
sensitivity of the project to the environment and affected people the design included a sound and
extensive participatory process. An HIV/AIDs awareness program was also included which had a
positive reception leading to a second campaign with a wider coverage.

5.1.2 Although the PAD mentioned a number of lessons taken into account from previous
operational experience some mistakes in the design were still repeated, such as not emphasizing
sufficiently the importance of site readiness for the timely commencement of civil works, and
stipulating sufficiently thorough screening processes before selection of contractors and
consultants. The project design was also vague about specific measures to build capacity
including how the project would assist in the modernization of the local contracting industry,
other than providing stable funding for road works contracts. The project team underestimated,
moreover, the local consultants‟ understanding of some project specific risks; in particular those
associated with the preparation of quality hill road designs. A significant portion of the civil
works had to be redesigned leading to project delays and an inherent design flaw, in the
sequencing of physical works meant that certain physical works under the rehabilitation and
maintenance components were getting completed much in advance of the up gradation works and
these segments were instantly used by traffic as detours and caused unanticipated damage. The
risk mapping also unwittingly missed out (with the benefit of hindsight) some other key risks
associated with civil works construction in the local environment, namely, availability of suitable
construction material, the relatively small window for physical construction during the year, a
long material and equipment supply chain, environmental risks associated with fragile geological
exposed cut surfaces, and the sequencing of physical works across components. However, had a
competent contractor been appointed many of these issues would have been resolved.

(b)     Quality of Supervision. Is rated Moderately Satisfactory as explained below:

5.1.3 The quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The frequency of supervision
missions (two a year) was adequate and the supervision teams brought to bear all their relevant
skills, mostly from the country office, in a cost-effective way. The results of the executed works
were in the end satisfactory despite the delays and were widely welcomed by the road-users. With
regard to safeguards, the team performed creditably well and the project conformed to the
guidelines in respect of consultation and transparency. The team created goodwill with the
affected communities by introducing small sub projects to provide soccer pitches and small ponds.
The supervision consultant‟s costs increased sharply, despite Bank advice to PWD, because of the
construction delays. Final figures show that supervision costs were nearly 35 percent of the civil


                                                14
works costs. While this was not raised at the time as an issue, steps could have been taken to
monitor these costs more closely and contain them where appropriate. At MTR the maintenance
component was scaled down and the Phase II maintenance activities were excluded. Only one
performance indicator, however, was modified to reflect this change. The project team could also
have insisted on better M&E reporting during implementation, especially for the ISAP activities,
and could have followed up more assertively to ensure that proper monitoring took place.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance.                 Is rated Moderately
Satisfactory as follows:

5.1.4 The Bank has played a substantial role in assisting the GOM to focus on the importance
of maintenance and building institutional capacity. However, the Bank‟s performance at both the
design stage and in implementation was mixed. As noted above, improved planning, design, and
greater supervision effort might have removed some of the constraints to project progress and
reduced the need for so much additional finance. Given the moderately satisfactory performance
at entry and during supervision, the overall Bank performance rating is also moderately
satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance. Is rated Moderately Satisfactory as explained below:

5.2.1 The GOM demonstrated a strong level of commitment and ownership toward the project
design, preparation and implementation through a number of actions including: (i) full agreement
with the institutional strengthening action plan; (ii) endorsement of the road development policy
and adoption of roads master plan outlining the state‟s commitment to improve both management
and funding of the road sector; and (iii) maintaining a high degree of continuity in its project
management team; and (iv) counterpart funds were provided when needed.

5.2.2 However, the GOM did not provide adequate resources recommended in the master plan
for maintenance of road network including the project roads which has put a question mark on the
medium to long term sustainability of the project assets.

(b)     Implementing Agencies Performance. Is rated Moderately Satisfactory as below:

5.2.3 The implementing agency correctly recognized its limited capacity to handle large
projects. Indeed, for all local parties involved, these were the largest contracts they had ever been
involved with. PWD, nevertheless, proactively supported the proposed road sector reforms and
has taken initiatives to demonstrate its new capabilities in the handling some large new civil
projects. Encouraged by the Bank, PWD also embraced the practice of greater transparency,
through „clean‟ procurement and consultation with road users, other government branches and
civil society.

5.2.4 Both the PWD and the PIU evolved considerably from the situation prevailing at project
inception and some of the reasons for the delays were partly beyond their control. This said,
initially the PIU was far too lenient with contractors who did not meet their obligations, reflecting
the PIU‟s inexperience. At MTR, the issue of inadequate documentation related to R&R
disbursement was also highlighted. A detailed post verification of project affected persons
undertaken in July 2006 indicated several gaps in documentation, although no financial anomalies
were detected, this was nevertheless a cause for concern and the project subsequently improved
its R&R documentation and processes. The first estimation of the amount required for additional


                                                 15
financing was insufficient and a further request then had to be made in order to complete the
project. Moreover, the M&E was inadequate and many of the softer issues relating to institutional
performance were either not measured or poorly measured. Given these shortcomings, on balance
the performance of the implementers was moderately satisfactory.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Is rated Moderately
Satisfactory as below:

5.2.5 GOM, as the end beneficiary, could have taken more advantage of the project to
strengthen some of its functions, but it did not and this resulted in some key institutional
strengthening activities not reaching fruition. In particular, the failure to operationalize the road
fund stands out. For this reason, taking into account the performance of the government as
moderately satisfactory and the performance of the implementing agency also as moderately
satisfactory, the overall weighted Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1 What can the Mizoram experience teach us about operations in a remote geographical
and economically disadvantaged state?

6.1.2 First, where feasible, policy and strategy support and wider institutional changes should
be delinked from the investment project delivery, since the progress of each area will adhere to a
different timetable. Institutional change is a challenge that can at best achieve goals fairly
gradually over a medium term horizon. This implies that the Bank should commit support for a
commensurate time period if it wants to assure sustainable results. A program approach with
triggers to move from one stage to the next may be more appropriate. In time it should be
possible to transition from a PIU to a more stable integrated departmental solution for project
management.

6.1.3 Second, the inclusion of too many components in a project (six in this case) negatively
affects implementation, because both the client and the Bank have limited resources for effective
supervision and implementation. When clients have limited capacity to begin with, it may be
prudent to limit components to fewer with a similar implementation format. Similarly, the project
should not have too many indicators. Fewer, measurable and objective monitoring indicators and
a well designed evaluation system will better assess the baselines and subsequently achievement
of project outcomes.

6.1.4 Third, special measures should also be introduced to ensure top caliber consultants are
appointed when local capacity is weak. In this case inferior consultants paid on a time basis were
in effect rewarded because of the project delays. The project should have adequate contingency
arrangements in line with Bank norms.

6.1.5 Fourth, hill road design and construction is a specialized field. Therefore the terms of
reference for design and the qualification criteria for works contracts should be carefully
reviewed to mitigate the risks involved. The Bank‟s task team should include a technical expert in
this specialized field to review the outputs. In countries with weak capacity in both Government
and the private sector the regular ICB approach may not be the best option and if alternative
approaches are to be used this should be considered at an early stage.




                                                 16
6.1.6 Fifth, bio-engineering measures using local bamboo and traditional techniques may be
used to stabilize landslide-prone hill sides. This promotes local employment generation. The
success of using such techniques in this project has led to replication in areas such as Himachal
Pradesh.

6.1.7 Sixth, debris disposed in an environmentally friendly manner can also benefit the
community. In the Mizoram project the debris provided a unique opportunity to create football
pitches and water storage ponds for the local community.

6.1.8 Lastly, the phasing of works, both time-wise and content-wise should be done carefully
so that clients can learn from the lessons gained during first phase implementation in such a way
that the physical works elements do not impact each other. This implies a program of less
ambitious, but smaller sequential projects of shorter duration, possibly preceded or in parallel
with a technical assistance project. Careful thought needs to be given as to how financial
management and other skills will be transferred to the PIU.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost Benefit Analysis for Aizawl – Lunglei Road including bypass

1.      Revised cost-benefit analyses have been carried out for the three contracts for road
upgrading Phase I and Phase II whose costs have increased substantially due to the reasons cited
in the main text. The methodology followed for the economic evaluation for these contracts was
same as that used at the appraisal, Indian Road Congress SP-30 for estimating vehicle operating
costs (VOC) and speeds under different road conditions and widths. The cost of construction and
the input parameters used for the analyses were updated for the year 2007 for which the VOC
data were available in SP-30.

2.       The results of the economic analysis are summarized in the table below. The results
indicate that the investments through these contracts are economically justified despite large
increases in the cost. In the case of contracts for upgrading, although the costs have increased by
about 70 percent over the costs at appraisal, the overall economic rate of return (ERR) of 17
percent, is estimated to be above the threshold value of 12 percent mainly due to the higher than
anticipated growth of traffic. The results are based on the future growth at the same rate as used at
the time of appraisal and therefore the economic rate of return is on the conservative side. The
current traffic has grown at double the rate than was assumed at the time of appraisal. Also, the
traffic on the parallel NH which is about 65 km longer has increased to twice the estimated traffic
at the time of appraisal and this has resulted in larger savings from diverted traffic.

3.       Since the assumed traffic growth rates from 2011 onwards have been considered at a
much lower rate than actual growth rate during the last 10 years, the economic rate of return is
quite conservative and no further reduction in the traffic growth rate is envisaged. Even though
the economic cost of the upgrading component has almost doubled in comparison to the appraisal
cost, the ERR continues to be above 12 percent and therefore the investment on this component is
justified.

   1.      Introduction

   1.1      Mizoram, a tiny state in the north-eastern corner of India with geographical area of
   21,078 sq. km and a meager population of 1 million occupies a very important strategic location.
   It is bounded by Bangladesh and Tripura State in the west, Arakan & Chin Hills Provinces of
   Myanmar in the south and east respectively and Assam& Manipur States in the north. It has a
   comparatively long international border of 720km. Mizoram lies between 21o58‟ and 24o35‟
   north latitude and 92o15‟ and 93o29‟ east longitudes. The tropic of cancer passes through Then
   Aizawl village, 90 km south of the state capital Aizawl. The state stretches over 227 km along the
   north-south and 121 km along the east-west directions. The state‟s topography is, by and large,
   mountainous with precipitous slopes forming deep gorges culminating into several streams and
   rivers. The hills are broken and undulating, and almost all the hill ranges traverse in the north-
   south direction. The capital city, Aizawl, with a population of 2.19 lakhs is located at 1,132 m
   height above mean sea level while Lunglei town and Champhai town are located at 1,222m and
   1678m above the sea level respectively. Mizoram has a pleasant climate, generally cool in
   summer and not very cold in winter. The temperature varies between 20oC and 30oC during
   summer and between 11oC and 21o C in winter. The average rainfall in the state is 2540 mm.

   1.2     With the principal aim of improving and strengthening of high density corridors and also
   to reduce maintenance backlog that have been accumulated over the past years, the state
   government has participated in the State Roads Infrastructure Development Technical Assistance
   Project (World Bank Loan No. 4114-IN) taken by Govt. of India from the world bank with the
   hope of getting financial assistance for their implementation. Out of US$51.5 million loan from
   the World Bank, US$5 million was set aside for all special category states, of which US$2.5
   million was allocated for Mizoram. With this Technical Assistance „Intercontinental Consultants
   & Technocrats Pvt. Ltd (ICT)‟, New Delhi in joint venture with „Consulting Engineering Services
   India Ltd(CES), New Delhi and in association with Louis Berger International Incorporated
   (LBII), USA was engaged from 22nd August 1998 as Project Coordinating Consultancy Services
   to carry out SOS, Feasibility Study and prepared Project Report. After having eight World Bank
   Project Preparatory Missions the Project Appraisal mission was done from December 18 – 21,
   2001. Credit Negotiation was held with the World Bank in Washington DC USA during February
   8-13 2002; Credit Agreement was signed on May 6, 2002 and the Project became effective from

           been done fully by the Department.
(v)        Overall contribution from Environmental Management Unit is noteworthy. Regular site
           visits, interactions with contractors and consultants, imparting training to their staff on
           job and PIU have greatly helped in successful implementation ESMP.
(vi)       The Banks support missions (usually twice a year for the whole implementation Period as
           well as project Preparation) comprising of full expert teams of all streams that are
           essential for successful implementation of project, were of a high standard and beneficial
           to the project. The Bank‟s rigorous mission touching all the details had helped in
           successful completion of civil works, financial monitoring, Contract management,
           Institutional Development, Procurement issues, Quality control and implementation of
           Environment and Social Management Action Plans though it sometimes felt harsh to the
           implementing agency. The comments and suggestions in Aide Memoire had helped in
           solving the problems with other line departments.
(vii)      In all, the project has received good appreciation from the public. The timely assistances
           and advices from World Bank, contribution from PIU with lean staffing structure with an
           excellent cooperation of the Consultants and Contractors made it possible to refurbish the
           quality infrastructure.
(viii)     Such good experience and exposure have made department more confident to take on
           similar project of larger size in near future.

6.      Problems Faced in the Implementation

6.1     The execution and completion of MSRP Works took more than 8 years instead of the
original 5-year time frame. The cost of execution had also ballooned on account of substantial
increase in scope of works and high cost escalation.

6.2     Termination of Phase I ICB Contract: Due to slow progress and violation of the
contract agreement, Phase I contract was terminated. At the time of termination only about 20%
of the Works were completed, and the balance works was awarded to three other contractors. The
new contractors need mobilization time thereby resulting in loss of one working season.

6.3     Adverse Climatic Conditions: Adverse climatic conditions on account of the annual
monsoon season lasting at least 5 months but usually much longer would appear to be the most
serious impediment in the execution of roadwork in Mizoram. The effects of Monsoon during
construction are given below in brief:
(a)     Shortens the working season and much more so if the monsoon season is an extended one.
(b)     Trigger landslides, cause soil erosion and sedimentation as well as result in valley side
        slope failures thereby increasing scope of works.
(c)     Damage completed works including drainage and slope protection structures as well as
        the pavement. This again increases the scope of works and construction time.
(d)     Result in compromising the quality of pavement work on account of ingress of water and
        degradation of sub-grade, prolonged exposure of pavement layers to monsoon rains, need
        for carrying out pavement work under wet conditions and lagging effect of drain
        construction. In fact, monsoon rains were identified as one of the major causes for the
        premature deterioration of the completed pavement.

6.4      Scarcity of good Construction Materials: There are no readymade aggregate to procure
in the state nor there is no developed quarry to depend with. The Contractor has to locate, develop,
and run the quarry. The most difficulty is locating a good quality source of quarry.

6.5    Problems Associated with Mizoram State‟s Remoteness from the Plain: The State‟s
remoteness put it at a distinct disadvantage insofar as implementation of large scale project is
concerned. The geographical limitations represented another major impediment in the
implementation.

6.6      Shortage and Disruptions in the Supply of Diesel, Bitumen and Cement: The
problem here is that there are periodical shortage and disruptions in the supply of key
construction material such as diesel, bitumen and cement, especially during the working season,
due to various reasons such as national transporters strike, strikes by petrol/diesel tanker operators,
arterial road cut off due to bridge collapse, flooding or landslides as well as law and order
disturbances in neighboring states.

6.7     Problems Associated with traffic during construction: Due to the topographical
nature of the whole state it is almost impossible to construct bypass road to divert traffic during
construction and the roads are the only links for all the villages along the road it is impossible to
close the road. The adverse impact included loss of work productivity and the corresponding
increase in construction time as well as compromise on pavement work quality.




                                                 30
6.8       Lack of Adequate Experienced and Skilled Manpower: Even though shortage in the
supply of experienced and skilled manpower is a general problem faced by contractors in India it
is not illogical to suggest that the problem would be more acute in Mizoram due to its remoteness.
This had posed a major impediment in the implementation.

6.9     Unseasonal Rains: In Mizoram you can expect rains on any day(s) of the months from
December to May, this un-seasonal rains have the effect of shortening the already short working
season and must be considered as an impediment. Its adverse impact comes in the form of loss of
valuable working days.

7.      Lessons Learnt

7.1     The implementation of MSRP-I had gone through much trials and tribulations. While
numerous setbacks were suffered during the execution of the Works, problems and challenges
had also been partly overcome. Crucially, the implementation revealed certain hard facts which
one has to come to grips with when implementing any major road project in Mizoram, as well as
certain shortfalls and weaknesses which need to be addressed comprehensively at the
procurement stage for mitigating the risks of execution. There are obviously valuable lessons to
be learnt from the implementation of this project, but the extent of the learning would depend
very much on one‟s intimacy with the Project and one‟s perception and understanding of the
impediments; several lessons learned are explained in the following sub-sections.

7.2     High Execution Risks: Having identified many impediments that almost derailed the
implementation of the Project the implementation of any major road project in Mizoram would
face similarly high execution risks. This is because of certain external factors and ground realities
which are beyond every party‟s control and cannot be mitigated even with detailed planning and
comprehensive engineering design.

7.3     Trade-off between Time, Cost and Quality: Another fundamental lesson learned from
the implementation of this project is the need for trade-off between time, cost and work quality if
any major road project was to be ever completed in Mizoram. It is almost impossible to construct
good roads in Mizoram for reasons such as the long monsoon seasons, and lack of good quality
stones.

7.4      The fact that the overall quality of the Works, particularly the pavement work, was less
than it was expected. It may be stated that aggregates and sand not complying with the specified
physical requirements had unavoidably been incorporated in the works at times and that damage
to sub-grade and pavement layers due to monsoon rains and plying of traffic could not be
properly made good, because of the simple reason that working seasons were too short and that
the Contractors had to proceed with the next work activities if they were ever to achieve at least
the minimum target in a working season.

7.5     Understanding of the Adverse Impact of Monsoon Seasons: It may be stated that the
adverse impact of monsoon seasons is the most serious impediment in terms of time lost, quality
of works, deterioration of completed works and heavy landslide almost every season. This is
explained in the above section.

7.6    Detailed Site Investigations, Comprehensive Engineering Design and Complete
Contract Documentation: There was difficulty in administering a contract due inaccuracies,
omissions and discrepancies the originally designed of horizontal and vertical alignments and
inadequate details drawings for pavement, drainage, slope protection and other works. The lesson


                                                 31
learnt here is that a comprehensive engineering design and complete documentation would go a
long way in smoothening out the execution of the Works and minimizing disputes from the
contractors.

7.7      Long Time for Completion and High Cost of Construction: Questions had always
been asked regarding the substantial extension of time granted to the Contractors and the large
increase in cost of construction. External factors like adverse climatic conditions, topographical
restrictions and geographical limitations will not go away and cannot be mitigated. Other
impediments will gradually surface during the course of execution but one other key determinant
is the availability of adequate good quality stones. It is observed that the first working season
spent for mobilization only and with all other conditions favorable for construction and no
material problem, the achievable rate of contractor in one working season is approximately 12 km
for pavement works. Therefore, Time for Completion cannot be fixed arbitrarily without due
regard to the several external factors and many impediments likely to be faced during work
execution and that provisions have to be made for the likely increase in scope of works and
construction cost.

7.8   To complete the project in three or four year, contract packaging may be kept within 50
Km road length, or the project cost within `50 to 80 lakh.

7.9    Problems Associated With the Procurement of Adequate Good Quality Stones: The
problems can be group into four levels such as:

(i)      Lack of good quality stones in Mizoram.
(ii)    Even if good quarry sources could be identified, securing the sources, developing the
        quarries and actually producing the stones is time consuming and costly and there is no
        guarantee that it will be successful.
(iii)   Even after quarries are developed and operated, the production of aggregates of
        conforming quality is not assured because of the nature of Mizoram rocks which are of
        sedimentary deposits and comprise predominantly of friable sandstones and thinly-
        bedded shale.
(iv)    Good quality stones are generally available in small deposits which are few and far in
        between.

7.11     Therefore, availability of substantial sources of good quality stones is a fundamental
issue in road construction in Mizoram, non-availability of substantial sources of good stones will
leave the Time for Completion indeterminate, which will further leads to the use of substandard
aggregates which is unavoidable and has to be accepted or else no major roads can be constructed.

7.12   Specific Design Considerations for Hill Roads: The specific design consideration
would include, inter alia, the following requirements:

(i)     Adoption of different pavement composition at different sections to cater for differing
        sub-grade conditions. For example wet areas are usually experience with the slope
        facing north need sub-soil drainage and boulder soiling to avoid premature damage of
        pavement layers.
(ii)    Emphasis on sub-grade drainage.
(iii)   Careful selection of bituminous base and wearing courses to ensure the overall stability
        and durability of the pavement.




                                               32
(iv)     Particular emphasis on selection of binder and binder content to take care of likely
         thermal stresses and brittleness in bitumen as well as use of porous stones which tend to
         absorb bitumen.
(v)      Complete sealing of shoulders to prevent ingress of water into the pavement layers and
         sub-grade.
(vi)     Careful selection of type of wearing course at sharp bends and/or stretches with steep
         gradient.
(vii)    Need for an efficient sub-surface and surface drainage system for ensuring road stability.
(viii)   Comprehensive measures for slope stability, erosion control and landslide correction.

7.13   The key lesson to be learnt here is that engineering design for Mizoram roads is a very
complicated design engineer must have the requisite experience.

7.14    Unfinished Land Acquisition: The Lesson to be learnt here is that road right-of-way
needs to be clearly defined right from the start of the contract and complaints from landowners
need to be resolved quickly.

7.15     Public Interference: The key lesson to be learnt here is that complaints and demands
from, as well as the feelings, sentiments and expectations of the public cannot be ignored and
continuous consultation with the public by the Employer is the best avenue for minimizing public
interference.

7.16     Shortage and Disruptions in the Supply of Key Consumables and Construction
Materials: This refers to diesel, critical plant spare parts, bitumen and cement which are crucial
to the timely completion of the Works but had to be sourced entirely from outside Mizoram and
hence, extremely vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain. The key lesson to be learnt here is
that shortage and disruptions are the norms rather than exceptions and will continue to affect
future major road projects, thus adding to the Time for Completion.

7.17     Lack of Adequate Experienced and Skilled Manpower: The key lesson to be learnt
here is that the problem of shortage or lack of adequate experienced and skilled manpower will
not go away anytime soon but will only worsen on account of the ambitious road construction
program currently being launched in Mizoram and the very limited pool of skilled manpower
available.

7.18   Importance of Environmental Management, Health and Safety Aspects of the
Works: The overall compliance by the Contractors could be said to be unsatisfactory and this
was a source of much frustration to the Bank, Employer as well as for the SC. The main
shortcomings seemed to be the low level of awareness on the part of the Contractors and the lack
of emphasis of the importance in the Contract documents. Therefore, the requirements of
environmental, health and safety measures would need to be clearly written into future contracts.

7.19     Misappropriation of Advance Payments: The key lesson to be learnt here is that the
utilization of advance payments needs to be monitored very closely or mobilization /equipment
advance payment may be paid in two stages based on the mobilization of the contractor.

7.20     Realistic and Longer Term Traffic Projection: The key lesson to be learned here is
that traffic projection based on historical trends of traffic or economic growth would not be
realistic and that pent-up demand needs to be considered.




                                                33
7.21    The Contractor‟s Un-preparedness: It is found that the contractors bid and actually got
awarded contracts in Mizoram without knowing the risks entailed. Soon after commencement of
works, they found themselves unprepared and mired in big problems and resorted to raising many
disputes in order to cover up their own weaknesses. The lesson to be learnt here is that the
execution risks must be explained clearly to the bidders to enable them to price in, and that the
lowest bid may not necessarily be the best competitive bid. Mobilization Advance may be paid in
installments depending on their progress of mobilization.

7.22    Selection of Consultants and Contractors and the Subsequent Monitoring: It is
realized that reputable firms from outside Mizoram do not necessarily translate into good
execution in Mizoram. Similarly, people claiming to have hill road construction experience do
not necessarily have the requisite experience to handle road projects in Mizoram. It is also crucial
that the performance of the selected consultants and contractors be monitored closely. The key
lesson to be learnt here is that the Employer needs to be more circumspect and thorough in the
selection exercise, though this is easier said than done. It will be in the interest of the project if
the PCC is the Supervision Consultant during execution of works.

         COMMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT, MIZORAM
        ON IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT
                   (IDA 36180 IDA 36181 IDA 48120)


1.   General Comments:

     The Borrowers Performance in general is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This rating is
     not acceptable to us. The self assessment of the Public Works Department is based on the
     following Points and rated as Highly Satisfactory:

     a. This is the first ever World Bank Project and of the first largest project implemented
        by PWD, having no prior experience in this line, our performance, lessons learnt, and
        the benefits for the PWD organization in the fields of procurement, Financial
        Management, Institution Development, Environment and Social Management,
        Supervision of NCB contracts, management of Consultancy Services, Road safety,
        Implementation of IT and RMS are much better than it was expected.
     b. The problem faced during constructions due to remoteness of the area, Steep
        topography, High rainfall/heavy Monsoon, landslides, scarcity of good construction
        materials, non availability of skill workers and labours, inexperienced contractor and
        consultants for hill road construction and traffic problems during construction were in
        fact the major reasons of project delays. However, these problems were skillfully
        manage and solve by a small team of Project Implementation Unit, the hard works
        put by the Department in this regard is considered worthy of giving highly
        satisfactory.
     c. Project Implementation Unit which is composed of Project Director, 2 Executive
        Engineer (Procurement & Environment), SLAO,4 Assistant Engineers, R&R
        Manager ,Accounts Officer and other 3 staff manage this project, the performance of
        small PIU is also considered highly satisfactory.
     d. During Implementation one of the ICB contractor was terminated the matter was
        brought to the DRB by the Terminated Contractor, the DRB decided the case in
        favour of PWD and again the matter was brought to Arbitration by the Contractor,
        and the matter is again decided in favour of PWD, the hard work and the effort to
        counter the case put by the team is appreciable and rated highly satisfactory.
     e. Achievements of the Organization in implementing Institutional Development
        through the ISG such as Re-structuring of PWD from one Chief Engineer to 4 chief
        engineer with separate planning cell headed by CE, Separate ESAMU unit with Land
        Acquisition Coordinator, HR Manger, ISO Certification of some selected offices,
        Computerization of PWD are considered a great benefit for the PWD as well as for
        the state.
     f. The other new introduction that the Department gain from ISD such as Highway Acts,
        Mizoram State Road Policy, Road Fund Acts and Rules etc. also made changes to
        PWD in the right direction and considered highly satisfactory
     g. It is also worth mentioning that the second Additional financing amounting to US
        $ 13 million when it was approved, only 40 days was left before the project closure.
        However, the Department fully utilized the fund for successful completion of the


                                            35
         project in record time. This shows that PWD/PIU at the end of the project become
         more experience to manage the project, which gives us confidence to skillfully
         manage the second World Bank project. Therefore, the general performance of the
         Department is rated highly satisfactory.

2.   POD Indicators(s)

     (b) Intermediate Outcome Indicator(s)

     Indicator 1.1: “About 184 Km of State Roads are improved by EOP? (Page iii)

     Comments: 184 Km is only an initial target, the target is fully achieved and fully
     functional; the road length reduced to 179 km due to improved geometric design. The
     target road from Aizawl to Lunglei is fully completed and the travel time is reduces to
     about 60%. Rating 95% achieved in the ICR is not acceptable at all. During the project
     implementation the set of indicator used are different and we will appreciate if the same
     set of indicator is used for the ICR as well. Those indicators were used in the 2nd
     additional financing.

     Indicator 2.2: “All work delivered within time, budget, quality and safety
     constraints? (Page iv)

     Comments: These indicators were never agreed & never used by the Bank missions we
     are surprised that this indicator is being used.

     Indicator 4.1: “Sustained increase in maintenance funding for the core road network
     from 50 percent of requirement to 80 percent of requirement by EOP.? (Page v)

     Comments: Maintenance fund to be increase is only for the core road net work which is
     1100 km only, This indicator is total wrong, we don‟t understand why it is usedf. GOM is
     having sufficient fund to maintain core road net work. We have also received much
     higher maintenance fund from 13th Finance commission and have increase tremendously.
     The performance of the Implementing Agency has been underestimated; all the
     performance on Environment, Social, Financial and procurement are rated satisfactory
     and why the department performance is rated unsatisfactory in the ICR.

     Indicator 3.5: “Number of effective staff training days? (page v)

     Comments: Initial the department did not keep the record of staff training days but with
     the implementation of ISAP and appointment of HRD manager staff training days were
     maintained and are available with the Department. The training days records were also
     supplied to the Bank Missions.

     Indicator 4.2: “Functioning RMS developed and use in HQ and some field offices by
     MTR? (page vi)

     Comments: RMS is fully achieved through various modifications after having
     discussions with the Bank team and is functional and HQ office and some of the field
     offices, various round of road condition surveys were also carried out.




                                            36
3.   Comments on various paragraphs;

     Paragraph: 2.2 Implementation (Page 5)

     The procurement of Contractor and Supervision consultants for Phase I ICB were
     completed in March 2002 well before the credit become effective on 3rd June 2002 and
     the Phase I 3-NCB contracts were completed in December 2002 while the Quality
     Assurance consultant for the NCB contracts was also done in January 2003. It may also
     be mentioned that Phase II ICB contract was signed on 22nd October 2003, there was
     hardly any delay in procurement of civil works contracts. Frequent changes of key staff
     by the supervision consults, the consultants‟/contractors‟ staff received better offers due
     to various development project going on elsewhere in the country or abroad, with the
     living condition and remoteness of the area it is often preferable to leave the project, the
     executing agency could hardly refused or stopped them as there was no penalty clause in
     the consultancy agreement for such changes.

     (a)    Technically deficient in Road Design: The Geometric Design of the road was
            based on a market readymade computer programme which could not proper take
            care of Hill road design. The PCC even though carried out various test along the
            project road, the Engineering design was deficient, this is mainly due to non
            inclusion of sectional details, especially for those area where retaining walls and
            filling are to be constructed. In this case TOR for designed consultant should be
            drafted so that all the details were made for construction drawings.
     (b)    As for the delays in Mobilization, all the civil works contractor took almost a year
            to fully mobilized, partly the slow mobilization is due to negligence of the
            contractor but it is also due to remoteness of the state, transport bottleneck, narrow
            and curve road have also considerably caused delays in mobilization of the
            contractor as bigger and longer equipments/machineries need to be dismantled
            into smaller pieces. The effective working month available in one year is only six
            months against 8 months considered during project preparation time.
     (c)    As for staffing of the executing Agency, the strength of PIU was discussed in the
            initial stage of the project (i.e. project preparation stage) with the Bank mission,
            the Bank mission knowing the shortfall of staff in PWD, agreed to set up with a
            minimum number. The supervision work is done by the Consultants for ICB
            contracts, PIU staff even though involved deeply in the supervision did not have
            sufficient time to supervise the work.

     It may also be mentioned that the 3 NCB contracts which were supervised by the
     Department, completed much earlier than the ICB contracts with much less percentage of
     cost over run; all the civil work contracts except the terminated contract, there was no
     arbitration case, this should be considered while evaluating the performance of the
     executing agency as well as the supervision consultants.

        2.4.12 : Compliance with legal Covenants (Page 10)

        Comments: GOM and stake holders are seriously in implementation of state Road Fund,
        being Road Fund act and Rules already in place, the Road Fund will be implemented in
        the early stage of the 2nd World Bank Road Project, application is now under
        consideration of GOI.

        3.2: Achievement of Project Development Objectives (page 11)

        Comments: This assessment is not correct; we have achieved most of the indicators and
        the civil work is fully achieved, therefore rating only moderately satisfactory is not
        correct.

        3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome rating (Page 13)

        Comments: this justification is all wrong, we strictly object the outcome of Institutional
        strengthening development achievement to be rated moderately satisfactory, as we have
        been seeing various changes as per ISAP, there was considerable improvement for
        maintenance funding. In fact Maintenance fund overshadowed everything, please note
        that the shortage of Maintenance funding is a global phenomenon it is not only typical in
        Mizoram but it is in every states of India. During various Bank mission it is rated much
        batter we are surprised that it is rated only moderately satisfactory in the ICR. Even the
        performance of the implementing Agency during second additional Financing, where we
        were given only 40 days for 13 million USD, which completed in record time is not
        considered, we are rather surprised to see this report, this section in fact may kindly be
        revised.

4.      Para 5.1 Bank Performance (Page 14)

        Comments: From the beginning of the project, i.e from SOS, project preparation and
        various stages of project implementation the Bank missions were of highly qualified
        teams. Every mission the Bank easily found the requirement of specialized technical
        personnel and arrangement is made immediately to solve such problem. The bank
        mission always comprise of highly qualified Hill road, pavement, Procurement, Social,
        Environment experts, and helping the implementing agency tirelessly. The borrower/the
        Mizoram PWD rated the Bank Performance highly satisfactory. In fact the project may
        never be completed to such level without the Bank Missions.

5.      Para 6: Lesson Learned (Page 17)

        The lesson learnt put in the ICR is below expectation.

5.      In the analysis all the facts and events are not truly brought out. The quality of the
        Analysis and the fact present in this report are rather inadequate, we expect better
        analysis as we are now having full confidence to execute and implement bigger project of
        similar nature.

We are therefore, vehemently objected this report, overall performance of the Borrower should be
rather rated highly satisfactory.
