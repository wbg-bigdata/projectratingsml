MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PREI1DELT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPtENr ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
FOR A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A PUBLIC ENTERPRISES PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Uganda for SDR 11.7 million (IUS$15 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be oni
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help fiuancie a Public
Enterprises Project.
2.      Background:    The present Government, which came to power in May
1986, inherited an economy in disarray and a large number of poorly managed
and physically deteriorating commercial and public service enterprises.
The new Government had considerable success in restoring peace and
stability and, in May 1987, it formally launched a program of economic
reform which is being supported by an IMF Special African Facility program
and an IDA Economic Recovery Credit. Initial measures were taken to
establish a realistic exchange rate, reduce the budget deficit, introduce
expenditure controls, reduce the supply of credit to manufacturing
parastatals, begin E process of partial disinvestment and limit monetary
expansion. However, the sustainability of the reform process depends not
only on Government's capacity to maintain a viable policy framework, but on
the capacity of the civil service and key parastatals, including the
Government-owned banks, marketing boards and key public service agencies,
to implement these policies and quickly upgrade their productivity and
economic efficiency. Fulfilling these objectives will require restoration
of the administrative capacity and managerial and technical skills present
in Uganda in an earlier era.
3.        The parastatal sector is comprised of 112 enterprises; 56 of
these are industrial or agro-industrial firms and represent more than half
the value-added in the manufacturing sector. Key parastatals dominate the
supply of goods and services in all sectors, including agricultural
marketing, electricity, telecommunications, transport (air, rail, road),
sewerage and water supply, financial services, beverages and textiles and a
large range of other manufactured goods. The Government recognizes that
many of these enterprises could be more efficiently operated with private
sector management and with full or partial private sector ownership and has
thus approved a public sector enterprise portfolio rationalization program.
Under the program Government would retain IOOZ ownership in only 34
parastatals, completely divest or liquidate 22, and partially divest a
further 34. The precise status of the remaining 24 parastatals is still
being clarified, as many are either moribund or in the process of being
returned to previous owners. Hence, assistance is required to create the
framework for Government participation in commercially orierLted
enterprises, and to strengthen the Government's capacity to implement its
parastatal divestiture program, rehabilitate retained parastatals, and more
effectively administer, monitor and evalua-e the performance of the public
enterprise sector. In addition, further Government investment in public



enterprises is to be minimized prior to the recotmendations of the longer-
term policy review for tle sector.
4.      ProJect Objectives:  The broad objective of the Project is to
strengthen the capacity of the Government and key productive enterprises to
sustain economic recovery by increasing economic efficiency, productivity
and output while reducing financial losses in the public enterprise sector.
Specific objectives are to: (i) define and implement reforms in the sector
policy and legislative framework and strengthen sector administration and
enterprise management; (ii) prepare and initiate a& overall program of
rehabilitation and rationalization for all public sector enterprises,
integrating ongoing programs and; (iii) begin to implement a program of
rehabilitation, restructuring, divestiture and liquidation of selected in-
dustrial parastatal enterprises.
5.      Project Description:  Under the Project, financing would be
provided for local and international consultant services, training
activities, equipment and materials and special studies for the following
project components:
A. Ministry of Industry and Technology
(i)  Continue support for the Public Industrial Enterprise
Secretariat (PIES) in the Ministry of Industry and Technology
(MOIT) to assist with implementation of the Government's
rehabilitation, divestiture and liquidation program for
industrial parastatals (US$2.9 million).
(ii) Strengthen the capacity of the Uganda Development Corporation
(UDC) to implement an agreed program of divestiture, liquida-
tion and rehabilitation for the 35 UDC companies (US$2.1
million).
B. Ministry of Finance
(iii) Strengthen the capacity of the Statutory Corporations
Division (SCD) to assist it in managing the overall project
(procurement, contract negotiations, project accounting, and
reports for IDA); introducing financial and performance
monitoring indicators and controls; and delivering key
studies (US$2.3 million).
(iv) Conduct a Sector Administrative Reform and Planning Study
(SARAP) to define longer-term policies and institutional
arrangements for Government administration of public
enterprises; and outline an action program for rehabilitation
and performance improvement of all remaining public
enterprises. (US$0.5 million).
(v)  Undertake six detailed diagnostic studies and improvement
plans for large economically, financially or strategically
significant parastatal enterprises (US$3.0 million).
C. Enterprise Rehabilitation and Divestiture
(vi) Undertake management audits of about 10 of the most
commercially sound and economically viable manufacturing
enterprises, resulting in the selection of about five
enterprises for comprehensive management, technology or other
advisory services (US$3.2 million).



(vii) Provide specialized consulting services to design and help
implement a program of divesL'ture and liquidation of public
enterprises (US$1.0 million).
6.      Rationale for IDA Involvement:  IDA's involvtement in the provision
of technical assistance for public sector enterprise reform is consistent
with IDA's role in supporting structural adjustment for sustainable growth
in the Ugandan economy under an ongoing Ecoomic Recovery Credit (ERC I).
By concentrating management and technical skills on key public service
agencies, manufacturing enterprises, marketing boards and financial
intermediaries, the Project would facilitate the anticipated supply
response, and would complement the Third Technical Assistance Credit, which
seeks in parallel to strengthen essential civil service functions.  The
Project would also provide resources to enable the Government to implement
policies agreed in the framework of the first Economic Recovery Program,
and tho^e to be addressed under ERC II (under consideration) regarding
further rationalization of the public enterprise sector.
7.      Agreements Reached:  The Project supports the public sector
related policy actions that will be implemented under the IDA Economic
k-- :overy Credits. Agreement was reached at negotiations: (i) that until an
agreement is reached with the Association on the findings of the SARAP
study, which inter alia will examine UDC's future, UDC makes no investment
exceeding $250,000 without first consulting the Association; (ii) on
criteria for selection of parastatals to receive diagnostic studies and on
parastatals to be divested with the assistance of project consultant
services; (iii) on the composition, terms of reference and decision-making
powers of the Divestiture Implementation Committee; (iv) on approval by IDA
of the public industrial enterprises to be subjected to management audits
and on those to receive management and technology contracts, and advisory
services; and (v) that IDA will approve the performance contracts to be
agreed with companies receiving assistance under the Credit; in exchange
for agreed performance criteria, such contracts will specify and provide
for inter alia short-term access to foreign exchange needs and related
local credit, plus reforms in wages, salary, pricing and other policies
required to expedite rehabilitation. Dated Covenants agreed are (i) that
staff for PIES, SCD, and UDC acceptable to IDA should be appointed and ir,
pluce no later than May 31, 1989; and (ii) that the SARAP study would be
completed by November 1, 1989, with recommendations agreed between
Government and IDA by March 31, 1990; and that all key diagnostic studies
would be concluded and agreed by July 1, 1990. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Uganda are given in
Schedule C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report. No. 7280, dated October 14, 1988, is also attached.
8.      Justification and Risks: The Project would contribute to sustained
economic recovery by improving efficiency and productivity in the ad-
ministration of the public enterprise sector and management of key
parastatal enterprises; by increasing local resource mobilization through
increasing capacity utilization and debt service capability of industrial



enterprises and pricing, billing and collection for public service
enterprises; and by increasing private sector participation in
manufacturing enterprises. The major risks are internal differences
regarding the extent of divestiture and the ultimate level of Government
participation in commercially oriented activities beyond provision of basic
public services. However, Government's attempts to engage all major
interest groups in decision making regarding public enterprise sector
restructuring and divestiture augurs well for the implementation of an
eventual consensus position acceptable to IDA.
9.      Recommendationt I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Project.
