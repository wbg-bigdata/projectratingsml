F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to restore the productive capacity of rural areas through investments in
production and sustainable land management and through capacity building for producer organizations
and local communities. Beneficiaries would also include war-distressed returnees and internally
displaced persons.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)


Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The GEF operational program will address the causes of land degradation by accelerating locally
driven sustainable land management practices, contributing to maintenance of critical ecosystem
functions and structures (including maintaining agro-ecosystems, stabilizing sediment storage and
release in water bodies, and improving carbon sequestration through increase in vegetation cover)

     Comments        Coffee and cabbage indicators were dropped due to low CDD selection of these by beneficiaries;
                     Cassava target was mis-specified (see Box 2 in ICR);
                     For the five commodities showing improvements, productivity gains range from modest (40 to 50%

                                                           viii
                       attainment of target yield) for those commodities most affected by rain variations (tomatoes, onions and
                       especially, beans—See Section 2.2) to good (78%-100%) for the other four.
                    Overall achievement ratio of the PDO commodity yield indicators ranges from zero for cassava and
                       beans to 42-100% for the remaining measured commodities.
PDO Indicator      Increase in beneficiaries' net profit.
2:
           Value                  25%                         N/A                30%                              26%
   Date achieved                  2008                        2004               2008                             2010
      Comments      Baseline was mis-specified (see Section 2.3 in ICR)—it should read zero to inform on the PDO;
                    Net profits are measured as the ratio between production value and investments for 62% of the subprojects;
                    The target set for net profit of 30% is unrealistically high for these types of operations, particularly in a post
                      conflict situation. In addition, the results are very prone to weather variability. This points to a bad design
                      specification rather than issue of achieving the intended PDO.
                    Overall achievement ratio of PDO Indicator 2 is 87% with baseline zero; and 20% with the mis-
                      specified baseline. FRRs of 78% for these subprojects, considerably higher than a standard cost of
                      funds of 12%, makes these were very good investments at the sub-project level. This further supports
                      the argument that the baseline and targets were mis-specified in the design. If correctly specified, this
                      indicator would have provided strong support to the argument that the PDO was achieved.
PDO Indicator      Number of returnees and displaced persons reintegrated in their communities.

      Comments        The project targets, baselines and actuals are households, not individuals;
                      Households are the target unit in the Project‘s activities;
                      The overall number of returnees and IDP households assisted by the Project is 215,516, as per the
                       independent evaluations and Bank‘s last ISR. The 2010 evaluation estimates that the Project has supported
                       20% of Burundi‘s war distressed returnees and IDPs;
                      215.516 is used to report on PDO Indicator 3 in ISRs, but the Government‘s ICR applied a stricter
                       interpretation of the PDO indicator by defining the ‗reintegrated‘ portion of the indicator: Reintegrated
                       include those HH among the 215,516 that were sowing for 2 successive seasons, were able to procure their
                       own seeds and able to replace their own tools ( 43,301 HHs);
                      Overall achievement ratio of PDO Indicator 3 is 92% (most strictly defined) of revised target (150% of
                       the original).

          Comments        As discussed in the ICR Section 1.3, GEO key indicators for the Project are only ever mentioned in an
                             appendix to the Project‘s PAD M&E annex and are not part of the Project‘s Results Framework (RF)
                             or legal agreements as such. GEO Indicator 1 in this table is cited in both the RF and legal agreements
                             for the Project in general and is cited as a potential ‗SLM indicator‘ in the PAD‘s GEO discussion in
                             the aforementioned annex (please see Section 1.3). The ICR therefore uses it to inform on the GEO;
                          Overall achievement ratio of GEO Indicator 1 is 125%.
    GEO Indicator 2:     Increase in vegetative cover
               Value               NA                   NA                       NA                              104,805 ha

          Comments           See discussion above about absence of explicit GEO indicators;

                                                             ix
                             An increase in vegetative cover is cited as a potential ‗SLM indicator‘ in the PAD‘s GEO discussion in
                              the aforementioned annex (please see Section 1.3) and figures in the original (not revised) legal
                              agreement as part of a combined indicator on vegetation cover and water harvesting for 10% of
                              ‗Depression Areas (East Zone). This was never measured and dropped in 2008 restructuring.
                              However, the ICR uses vegetative cover more generally, to help inform on the GEO;
                             Overall achievement ratio of GEO Indicator 2 cannot be calculate relative to a baseline, but the
                              Project’s improvement in vegetative cover accounts for 11% of arable land in Burundi. This is a
                              very positive achievement.

           Comments        It is unclear from the wording of the indicator what is meant by adopted—the census instruments and
                             methodology have been developed and tested. The census is pending a full roll out. The ICR notes
                             progress on the development of the census as the notion of ‗adopted‘ is ill defined.

           Comments        The increase in budgetary expenditure allocations to agriculture was achieved as it grew from 4.1% in
                             2008 (at restructuring) to 8.3% in 2009 (the last year with confirmed World Bank/GoB data).
                             Projections for 2011 are 10% according to the World Bank PREM team in Burundi. Note that it is
                             reported here to complete the RF but attribution is clearly not unique to the Project and the data to
                             analyze attribution more deeply is not available;
                           With respect to (ii) achieved, in ICR interviews, development partners (unsolicited) noted the marked
                             increase in coordination and alignment of sector programs and projects since the Agricultural Strategy

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Burundi is a poor country, beset by acute civil and ethnic conflict in the 1990s that was still in
full swing when preparation of the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land Management
Project (PRASAB) began in 2002. Per capita GNP in 2001 was only US$100, the second lowest in the
world.1 Ninety-one percent of the population lived in rural areas and the rural post-conflict poverty rate
in 2003 was 58 percent, up from 35 percent some ten years earlier. The widespread rise in poverty was
directly related to the conflict-induced economic collapse and the complete discontinuation of most
public services. In the rural space, the looting and destruction of basic farm capital goods and livestock
left those 90 percent of Burundians who relied on agriculture for their livelihood, bereft. The situation
among Burundi‘s refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) was particularly acute.2

2.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) notes Burundi‘s substantial agricultural potential, the
bottlenecks to achieving this potential, and the sector‘s critical importance to the country‘s macro
situation. Agriculture accounted for 50 percent of GDP and more than 80 percent of export earnings
from a non-diversified base (coffee and tea). Depletion of productive capital stock in the wake of
conflict, as well as structural challenges, was noted. These included weak agricultural research and
(especially) extension, soil degradation, low fertilizer use, and considerable land fragmentation into
small plots (0.7 ha average). In the absence of agricultural services and with severe disruptions to
production during times of civil conflict, food security concerns in this population-dense country (270
people/km2) led inevitably to deforestation and watershed degradation as natural resources were mined,
vegetative cover reduced, and soil erosion increased. The PAD also notes that much of the country‘s
300,000-plus hectares of arable marshland were underutilized. These factors accounted for a very low
agricultural productivity at appraisal, remedial measures for which were further constrained by poor
access to finance (less that 5 percent access) and the absence of rural banks.

3.      At appraisal, various Bank documents3 note the lack of capacity in the key line ministries—the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAE) and the Ministry of Land Management, Environment and
Tourism (MATET) for: ensuring environmentally sustainable management of marshlands and hillsides;
formulating policies on land-use issues; formulating rural development policies and strategies; and for
monitoring and implementing the same. This was confirmed by retrospective Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) interviews with Development Partners (DPs) who were active in
Burundi at the time of appraisal. The performance of agriculture was, and still is, widely linked with
overall economic performance. 4 This capacity issue at key ministries therefore posed a critical
bottleneck to post-conflict economic recovery.

4.      The rationale for World Bank assistance through PRASAB, as presented in the PAD, focused
directly on the issues identified above. The Project‘s activities (see components below) aimed to assist

revised upwards over time.

the Client in rebuilding the productive capacity of Burundi‘s rural inhabitants, returnees and IDPs,
service providers and local and central Government authorities. In so doing, the Project aligned itself
with the higher-order objectives of the Bank‘s Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, precursor to the
CAS) that was in effect at appraisal. Specifically, the TSS aimed to ―build a foundation for national
reconciliation, poverty reduction and durable peace‖ in explicit support of the four key development
challenges it cites: (i) achieving peace and security; (ii) reintegrating conflict affected groups; (iii)
improving welfare of the poor; and (iv) implementing socio-economic reforms for economic recovery
for sustained growth and poverty reduction.5 The decision to blend GEF funds with the Project was
particularly relevant in light of the physical degradation documented in the PAD, the Government‘s
own goals for natural resource management6 and the lack of capacity for land use planning and natural
resource management noted at all levels. At appraisal, the Project would contribute directly to the
Client‘s objectives for post conflict reconstruction as per its Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(IPRSP), 7 and its Agricultural Rehabilitation Program for War-Distressed Persons.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The PDO as documented in the PAD is ―to restore the productive capacity of rural areas
through investments in production and sustainable land management and through capacity building for
producer organizations and local communities. Beneficiaries would also include war-distressed
returnees and internally displaced persons‖. This differs slightly from the wording in the Development
Grant Agreement (DGA). Restoring productive capacity in rural areas is the core objective in both
formulations (see Annex 10 and Section 6 for more on this discrepancy). It is not straightforward to
identify the precise set of original ‗Key Indicators‘ for PRASAB, as these differ in three different parts
of the official Project documentation, namely, the PAD text, the results framework (RF) of the PAD
(Annex 3), and the DGA. See ICR Annex 10 for full account of original indicator articulation, where
there is considerable overlap between the different formulations. As the DGA only lists outputs, the
ICR lists here the original ‗PDO indicators‘ of the PAD RF:

     i.   At least 75 percent of the benefitting producer organizations (POs) and local communities
          (LCs) continue to function for the benefit of their members and follow the norms of good
          environmental and sustainable land management; and
    ii.   More than 80 percent of returning refugees and displaced families having received Project-
          financed kits have returned to normal agricultural life.
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
6.     Appendix 18 of Annex 3 of the PAD states that: ―The GEF operational program will address the
causes of land degradation by accelerating locally driven sustainable land management practices,
contributing to maintenance of critical ecosystem functions and structures (including maintaining agro-
ecosystems, stabilizing sediment storage and release in water bodies), and improving carbon

7
  Ibid. Economic growth and the reintegration of war-displaced persons form two out six of the Government‘s strategic axes
of their IPRSP. The IPRSP has as one of its key objectives to ―develop an agricultural sector centered on productivity
growth and reduced pressure on land,‖ with ―a diversified and modernized agricultural sector‖ as one of its higher level
goals. Social cohesion and rehabilitation also figure prominently throughout the strategy.
8
   The Appendix to Annex 1 of the PAD is the Project Design Summary table required in Bank PADs prior to 2004. The
Project went to Board at the transition point between the old Project Design Summary and the new Results Framework.
                                                            2
 sequestration through increase in vegetation cover.‖ It is also only from this Appendix to the RF in
 PAD Annex 3 that ―Key Indicators‖ can be found for the GEO. There are no baselines or targets set for
 these, however, and, in general they are not worded for measurability. They do not figure in either the
 Project‘s RF, or in the DGA, where there is no reference to GEO indicators at all, but to ‗land
 degradation‘ in the Project more broadly (see Annex 10 for summary of GEO-related indicators). The
 GEO ―key performance indicators‖ listed in the PAD Appendix 1 to Annex 3 are listed here because
 although they do not figure in the Project‘s RF or M&E targets, indicator (i) does provide the ICR with
 guidance on the GEO (see Section 3) and several of the Project‘s output indicators do support this GEO.
 They are(see Datasheet Section F):

  i.        Preservation or restoration of the structure and functional integrity of ecosystems as measured by
            a set of applicable sustainable land management (SLM) indicators (including soil erosion,
            siltation, change in vegetative cover, monitoring of encroachment/production in fragile lands, and
            key biodiversity in representative sites);
ii.         Institutional and human resource capacity is strengthened to improve sustainable land
            management planning and implementation;
iii.        Policy and regulatory framework is strengthened to facilitate wider adoption of sustainable land
            management practices; and
iv.         Greater awareness of SLM activities and issues among producers.

 1.4 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons for Revision


 7.      Section B of the ICR Datasheet depicts the PRASAB Project timeline, including formal
 restructuring in 2008 and 2010. The PDO was unchanged in either restructuring. Additional financing
 in 2008 was precipitated by a rapid and effective execution of Project activities, particularly in
 disbursement for sub-projects. The Bank preparation team at appraisal had been cautious about the
 speed of a quality implementation for PRASAB‘s CDD sub-project activities given the post-conflict
 context. When the Project proved to be disbursing well, and with consistently satisfactory overall
 implementation ratings, the case for additional financing was made at midterm (2007) and additional
 financing was prepared in the amount of US$15 million (see Table 1). 9 Revision of the RF was
 undertaken at the same time, although these approved revised indicators largely reflect the de facto set
 of indicators tracked by the Project team since early implementation, when weaknesses in the original
 RF became apparent (see Annex 10 for a complete tracking of ISR indicators and Section 2.3 for
 discussion). The Project RF revision in 2008 formally changed PDO indicators10 to:

       i.    Productivity increase of main agricultural and livestock products in project area;
      ii.    Increase in beneficiaries net profit; and
     iii.    Number of returnees and displaced persons reintegrated in their communities.
 Datasheet Section F lists all formally revised indicators (PDO and intermediate).
 The restructuring of 2010 extended the closing date of the Project by seven months to allow for
 execution of Project activities (resources for which had been augmented by almost 40 percent in 2008).



 9
   The case, and its approval by the Board, is documented in the 2008 restructuring package.
 10
    These are the PDO indicators approved in the restructuring package and tracked by Project. Again, they differ slightly
 from the articulation used in the legal agreements. Please see Annex 10 for details.
                                                              3
1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators

8.     The GEO was not formally revised during Project implementation. As noted above, the GEO
Key Indicators were never explicitly a part of the Project‘s RF even at PAD stage, but continued to be
informed to some extent by the Project revised indicators (e.g., area under SLM).

1.6 Main Beneficiaries
9.      The primary target groups for the Project are found in the PAD, component by component. The
main beneficiaries of productive investments under Component 1(a) CDD sub-project (SP) activity(see
component descriptions below) are the women and men of local community based organizations
(CBOs) and POs receiving SP support. The main beneficiaries under Component 1(b) are returnees and
IDPs. At the time of the 2008 Additional Financing, the indigenous peoples group of the Batwa was
added as target beneficiaries of PRASAB‘s Component 1 and OP 4.10 was triggered (see ICR section
2.4 below for further discussion). The main target group of the capacity building activities of
Component 2 include: CBOs, POs, local implementing agencies, and technical staff of the MAE,
MATET and of the Burundian Institute of Agricultural Science (ISABU). The causal links between the
Project‘s investments and the intended beneficiaries named in this section are explored in Section 3 and
graphically depicted in the Results Chain for the Project (Figure 1).
1.7 Original Components (as approved)

10.      The Project has three components:

11.     As can be seen from Table 1, Component 1 is the largest. The lion‘s share of this Component,
in turn, goes to sub-component 1(a) Production and Sustainable Land Management Investments,
largely for the financing of CDD matching grants for locally identified SPs. 11 Sub-component 1(a) also
finances: the contracting of local implementing agencies (LIAs) to provide support services to POs and
CBOs for their successful SP design and implementation; the development of ten SLM demonstration
watershed sites across representative agroecological zones; and rehabilitation and development of
marshland irrigation schemes. See footnote 13 for description of incremental SLM activities for SPs.
US$10.3 million finances Sub-component 1(b) Emergency Support for Returnees and Internally
Displaced People for agricultural startup kits for these vulnerable groups. The activities of 1(a) in

  At Project end, of 3101 ‗productive‘ SPs, 1107 were for livestock, 171 for food crop production; 78 for cash crop
production; and 76 small-scale irrigation; 294 integrated livestock and 269 off-farm activities (including value adding
equipment, carpentry, crafts, apiculture and fishing/aquaculture). Add to this 622 dedicated forestry SPs and incremental
(GEF-financed) SLM activities to 1583 of the 3101 SPs described above.

supporting community group formation and SP application also extends to this group, and to the Batwa
as of 2008.

12.    Component 2, under sub-component 2(a) Enhancing the capacity of local communities,
producer organizations, and local implementing agencies builds the capacity of CBOs and POs for
sound administration, good service provision and natural resource management; and training for LIAs
to provide the support they are contracted to give local communities under Component 1. The sub-
component also supports capacity building of the local and provincial SP selection committees. At a
second level, under sub-component 2(b) Support for institutional strengthening of key public services,
the Project strengthens capacities of the MAE, the MATE, and ISABU—including the financing of
applied research projects and seed multiplication activities at ISABU.

13.   Component 3 supports Project coordination and management. PRASAB has a National Project
Coordination and Management Unit (NPCMU) under the MAE and three Inter-provincial Project
Coordination and Management Units (IPCMU).

14.     Figure 1 below fully depicts the multiple activities of each component and the causal links
between component activities/outputs and the PDO and GEO. Given the complexity of the
objective/indicators articulation for the Project described above, Figure 1 also clarifies (i) the indicators
used by the Project and in the ICR; and (ii) spells out the logical flow from the Project‘s activities to its
development outcomes in a results chain (RC).

15.     The actual ‗objective‘ portion of the PDO and GEO wording is isolated and faithfully
reproduced in Figure 1 in order to clearly specify the development outcomes under assessment (as
separate from the means to achieve these) although the means are also included in the RC. 12
Intermediate outcomes and indicators in the RC are drawn directly from the PAD, component-by-
component, and from the ‗means‘ specified in the PDO and GEO. The RC cites all formally approved
indicators and also supplements these with other relevant indicators mentioned within and beyond the
various Project documentation in order to provide as complete a picture of PRASAB outcomes as
possible. The ICR assessment is organized around Figure 1 and it is therefore presented early to
ensure readability of this assessment of PRASAB, particularly in the presence of poor M&E
articulation in Project documentation.

1.8 Revised Components
16.   The components were not revised. Additional financing in 2008 was allocated across existing
components as described in Table 1.
1.9 Other significant changes
17.     As indicated in the Datasheet Section H, the Project was restructured twice


12
   The GEO is a good example of why the RC is necessary to assess Project impacts. The GEO (―The GEF operational
program will address the causes of land degradation by [sic] accelerating locally driven sustainable land management
practices, contributing to maintenance of critical ecosystem functions and structures (including maintaining agro-
ecosystems, stabilizing sediment storage and release in water bodies), and improving carbon sequestration through increase
in vegetation cover‖ ) confounds the objective (addressing the causes of land degradation) with the means (accelerating
locally driven sustainable land management practices and increasing vegetation cover), and even with the potential
indicators (stabilized sediment storage and improved carbon sequestration), all of which are important. The RC therefore
respects each of these elements of the GEO and puts them in their logical place.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.     Project preparation and project design were well aligned with the rural development needs of
post-conflict Burundi. This can be seen from the numerous analyses referenced in the PAD, all of
which highlight the risk and needs associated with the conflict, the incipient peace process and key
aftermath issues (reintegration of returnees and IDPs, destruction of capital stock, cessation of rural
services, degradation of soils, etc.). Given this context, the ICR finds that the Project‘s objectives were
appropriate, focusing on restoring the productive capacity of rural areas in Burundi (PDO) with a clear
vision to sustainable land management and environmental concerns (GEO). This assessment is
reinforced by ICR interviews:
        All the [PRASAB] activities respond[ed] to Government demand and in fact, we all
        shared similarities in rural development programs across partners—there was a
        massive need and a massive response, geographically shared across the partners.14
19.      There is therefore evidence of good DP coordination in implementation, 15 but also in
preparation, with lessons drawn in the PAD from other partner operations in Burundi. Further to this,
the PAD cites lessons in the Project‘s design and approach from other Bank operations, including the
use of CDD investments; of GEF-financed SLM additionality; and of a sufficient resource allocation to
multi-level, multi-actor capacity building for implementation. The Bank safeguard policies were
realistic, although OP4.10 for IPs was not triggered until later (see below).

20.     Three factors made the operation risky at the time of preparation. Full scale fighting ended only
in December 2003 and 14 of 17 provinces in Burundi remained under critical UN security
classifications until 2005, so that the conflict was still in full swing at preparation. Second, the conflict
exacerbated capacity issues (and risks) at all levels for implementation and sustainability. Third, the
Project was prepared before the democratic election of 2005 with a transitional Government carrying
ownership and sustainability risks. Government counterpart contribution to the Project was zero. The
first two risks were largely and explicitly identified in the PAD. Assigned mitigated risk ratings were
frank and conservative (High and Substantial in most cases); and accompanying mitigation measures
for capacity were the right ones in terms of Project design (CDD articulation, financing for capacity-
building, etc.). The risks associated with the larger macro uncertainty were not rated in the PAD but
were identified and mitigated in component design and through high-level participatory preparation.
Respectively:
      Component 2 includes a range of support activities for capacity and policy formation of key
        ministries and agencies. In terms of transitional government, the selection of CDD for
        Component 1was the appropriate mitigating design feature for implementation of investments.
      In terms of the risks associated with an interim government for sustainability and buy-in, the
        Project was fully aligned with the Bank‘s transitional post conflict support to Burundi.
        Considerable time appears to have been spent in situ with high-level inter-ministerial planning
        and preparation meetings to build consensus between the different groups as they emerged from

  This partnership approach was evident throughout implementation with, for example, formal geographic coordination
activities with other DPs for Component 1(b) activities with returnees and IDPs. Chaired by the World Food Programme,
PRASAB (and other DP-supported Projects) targeted returnees and IDPs within an allocated geographic area to ensure,
collectively, national coverage.The Project‘s participation and success in this approach was confirmed in ICR DP interviews.
                                                            7
       conflict to co-governance. The task team maintained this intensity despite some mission
       curtailment by the Country Manager due to bombings in the capital.

21.    The ICR concludes that the task team and reviewing Bank management were fully cognizant of
the macro risks and mitigated with appropriate design and participation processes with the transitional
Government (grassroots beneficiary participation in preparation could not occur as field visits were not
permitted due to acute security concerns).

22.      In terms of complexity, as can be seen from the component descriptions above and from the full
depiction of project activities across components in Figure 1 and Annex 2, the Project is comprehensive.
While this argues for a complex design, the status of outcomes and satisfactory implementation ratings
attest ex-post to the Project‘s success in executing them. A key factor here was the choice of CDD
implementation for the SPs, which allowed articulation and implementation to proceed even as the
country‘s post-conflict super-structures and capacity were being rebuilt. In terms of the breadth of
activities, ICR interviews (quoted above) document the need for broad-based reconstruction with
geographic partition among DPs (see Annex 11 for provinces in which PRASAB was active).
2.2 Implementation
23.      The restructuring for additional financing in 2008 (and underlying disbursement and
implementation performance) provides evidence of the Project‘s ability to disburse and execute
activities to the satisfaction of the Bank. Project-end Aide Memoires and ISRs confirm the sustained
quality of implementation, as does the request of only a 7-month extension to conclude Project
activities, despite a 40 percent resource augmentation in 2008. Several key factors contributed to
successful implementation: (i) appropriate selection of a CDD approach and strong multi-level capacity
support in Project design; (ii) very strong Government project management that could identify and
correct problems as they arose; and (iii) close supervision and technical support from the Bank in the
early days of CDD implementation, and later in terms of implementation support despite sustained
security concerns. The first point (i) is discussed in greater detail in Section 3 below. All three factors
contributed to the Project‘s ability to diagnose and correct for implementation challenges as they arose.
Box 1 provides an example flagged in the MTR and independent evaluation documents.

 Box 1: CDD Approval and Implementation Process
 Initially, the pace of project approval by Community and Provincial SP Approval Committees (CCAPs
 and CPAPs, respectively) outstripped the flow of funds to approved SPs. By the start of 2007, only 43
 percent of SPs approved had received financing. Even prior to the MTR at the end of 2007, the Project
 had identified the bottleneck on the flow of funds and requested assistance from the Bank to unblock.
 Namely, the Project flagged that the threshold for CCAP approval of SPs at community level was so
 low as to result in most SPs approval congesting at the provincial (CPAP) level, which then impaired
 the CPAP‘s ability to facilitate the follow-through of flow of funds with the NPCMU. The Bank, in
 turn, was responsive to this and provided support by raising the cap, but also by reviewing and
 emphasizing in the 2007 MTR the need to fine tune the training to both CCAPs and CPAPs to (a)
 accompany the raised level of responsibility of CCAPs; and (b) enforce greater selectivity in SP
 approval. By 2010, the rate of financing for approved SPs had risen to 81 percent, which represents
 100 percent of available financing for the CDD investments activity of the project. That is, the 19
 percent of approved projects that did not receive financing was due to exhaustion of Project financing
 for this sub component, and not to ongoing implementation bottlenecks.




                                                      8
24.      Similar examples of good diagnostic and correction exist in the identification of challenges after
an initial round of SPs. For example, clean planting material and lack of seeds came up as constraints to
good SP implementation in a number of sub-sectors. The Project responded by providing support for
multiplication and seed production activities to beneficiaries (see Box 2 on cassava). Similarly,
corrective measures flagged in the MTR were quickly resolved in implementation. Examples include
the Bank‘s signaling of a stronger focus on management and due diligence in PO/CBO capacity
building and the need for midterm beneficiary assessments, both of which the Project undertook. There
are also documented instances where the in-course correction of Bank supervision was less successful.
These include the 2008 emphasis during restructuring on coffee, and the late diagnosis of the need for a
more sustained extension model for productive investments (discussed in greater detail in Section
5.1(b)).

25.     Disease (see Box 2) and climatic factors outside the Project‘s control created further challenges.
Seasons of either poor or excessive rain were cited in the Government‘s ICR, resulting in lower-than-
expected productivity for rainfed vegetables, some of which figure in the Project‘s (revised) PDO
productivity indicator. There were some factors within the Government‘s control that may have
impacted efficiency, including a reluctance to replace, reinforce or reform public LIAs in the five
provinces where the Project did not use private LIAs. While the SPs in these provinces still had
satisfactory rates of return, there is an open question about whether they could have achieved even
higher returns with better performing extension support.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design
26.    The ICR notes two key weaknesses in the Project‘s M&E design that persist even when the RF
was formally revised in 2008: (1) poor clarity; and (2) weak coverage.
   1. Poor clarity.
    a. There is a lack of clarity in the presentation of the actual key indicators, with considerable
       internal inconsistency within Project documents (see Annex 10). In exploring this issue with
       task team leaders, Project staff and AFTOS the ICR team concludes that a contributing factor
       was the delivery of the Project at precisely the moment of transition from the old PAD ‗Project
       Design Summary‘ to the modern ‗Results Framework‘. There would have been an adjustment
       mid stream through Project preparation from the old format to the new that contributed at least
       in part to the confusion found in Project documents. Second, new or modified indicators were
       added to legal documents that differed from their articulation in the quality-reviewed PAD (see
       also Section 6, Lessons Learned); and
    b. There is a lack of clarity in the actual formulation/articulation of some indicators and
       objectives, including the PDO and GEO. In support of this view:
        Both the PDO (from the PAD) and the GEO include a confluence of objective (e.g., restoring
         productive capacity in rural areas) with the means of achieving the objective (e.g., through
         investments in production and sustainable land management and through capacity, etc.). See
         also footnote 12 for GEO;
        The PDO is worded as if the objective were for the whole of the rural space in Burundi, when
         in actual fact, the objectives pertain to project areas. This can be seen both from the allocation
         of geographic areas of intervention among DPs who had similar programs (and not a ‗national
         coverage‘ approach), as we have documented elsewhere in the ICR. This clarification was
                                                      9
           added to the wording of revised PDO indicators that actually includes ‗in Project area‘(see
           Section F of the Datasheet);
         Articulation is sometimes unclear or inaccurate. For example, revised PDO indicator 3 refers
          to ‗persons‘ whereas the baselines, targets, and data all refer to households, in line with the
          Projects intervention modality (i.e., targeting households). Another example is in the indicator
          on the agricultural census being ‗adopted‘ with no guidance on what that means;
         The baseline for the revised PDO indicator on ―beneficiaries‘ net profit‖ is mis-specified. The
          indicator refers to the net profit accruing to beneficiaries from Project-financed SPs. As such,
          the baseline should be zero to represent the ‗without project‘ scenario and then the target of
          30 percent can be (correctly) interpreted as the net average profitability from SPs accruing to
          beneficiaries. Instead, the baseline was specified as 25 percent (the average SP profitability in
          2008) so that a project-end indicator would only show change in SP profitability over the
          second half of the project relative to SP performance in the first half, which does not inform
          on the PDO, but on project implementation over time.16 In addition, the revised target rate was
          unrealistically high for the types of sub-projects proposed. These returns would also be
          subject be a high level of variability. The design of this indicator made it a poor indicator for
          measuring the PDO achievements.
     2. Weak Coverage.
        The Project‘s PDO indicators may not inform fully on the Project‘s success or failure in
        ‗restoring productive capacity‘ in rural post-conflict Burundi (PDO), or in ‗addressing the
        causes of land degradation‘ (GEO). That is, although intermediate PDO indicators inform on
        the GEO, there remains a gap in the final analysis that could be remedied by the use of some of
        the original Key Indicators in the PAD for the GEO that were buried in an appendix to the RF
        annex (in particular, see (i) in Section 1.3 above). Given this, the ICR uses as many of the GEO
        key indicators named in the PAD text for which there is data available to assess outcomes in
        Section 3.
        Further to the GEO, in terms of sufficiency for coverage, revised PDO indicator (1) on
        productivity of eight commodities poses challenges. First, it is difficult in a CDD context to
        ensure the relevance of commodities chosen ex ante. A good example is the selection of coffee
        productivity in the 2008 revision: When coffee did not figure as prominently in communities as
        anticipated in 2008, that data became less relevant to the Project‘s decisions. 17 More
        importantly, while the ICR agrees that productivity is a critical measure, it may not on its own
        sufficiently inform on the PDO‘s well-placed focus on ‗productive capacity‘ in an immediately
        post-conflict context. Rather, productive capacity could be more directly measured to
        complement the slightly higher order ‗productivity‘ indicators. This logically follows what is
        known and documented in the PAD about Burundi‘s impaired productive capacity including:
            (a) agricultural capital stock (e.g. cattle, basic farming implements, etc.) looted or destroyed
                during conflict;


16
   In addition to this conceptual flaw, arithmetically, the Project-end achievement of 26 percent average net profit rate is
fully 87 percent of the project-end target of 30 percent, if zero were the correct baseline. In specifying 25 percent as the
baseline, the Project technically achieved only 20 percent (one percentage point) of its Project-end target.
17
    ―We were starting in PRASAB from nothing at all—it was an adventure into the unknown. We were trying to envision
what the targets might be. It was also CDD—we could not know what would emerge. As the Project evolved, we naturally
selected indicators for the commodities that were emerging as most relevant to beneficiaries…? Interview with Project Staff
                                                            10
          (b) almost non-existent extension and support services for agricultural production and low
              capacity among producers;
          (c) large number of returnees and IDPs disconnected from productive activity and assets;
          (d) lack of institutional framework and policies for sustainable agricultural growth; and
          (e) documented collapse in production and productivity putting pressure on marginal lands
              for food security and survival.
       The Project‘s activities logically follow from these issues. So for example, respectively, Project
       activities on (a) SP investments in capital stock and agricultural kits to war-distressed persons;
       (b) financing and training for private and local service providers to provide extension and
       support activities for agricultural production; (c) reintegration support for returnees and IDPs;
       (d) support to key ministries for M&E and critical land and sector strategy formation; and (e)
       incremental GEF-financed SLM activities for environmental sustainability, are mapped to
       intermediate outcomes and indicators that inform on these (see Figure 1). Where the flow could
       be improved is in the selection of direct ‗productive capacity‘ indicators.
       A good example of both the challenges in selecting the right commodities and of the need to
       complement productivity measures can be found in Box 2.

                   Box 2: The Case of Cassava Productivity (MT/ha) as PDO Indicator
        Consider the use of the cassava productivity indicator to inform on the PDO. It can be seen in
        Section F of the ICR Datasheet that there is no increase in cassava productivity from the
        baseline (10 MT/ha) to Project-end (10 MT/ha). The logical conclusion is that the PDO
        indicators was not achieved for cassava and, from that, (at least partially) infer that the PDO
        was not achieved (in the absence of other indicators). In actual fact, at a time when cassava
        production (a key food security staple) across the sub-region was devastated by the cassava
        mosaic virus, PRASAB imported the first clean mosaic-resistant tubers into Burundi from
        Uganda and the DRC. Project beneficiaries who prepared cassava SPs did so for
        multiplication of disease-resistant tubers to sell and distribute to other farmers across the
        country. Multiplication of tubers requires their harvest before full maturity (before reaching
        the full targeted yield in the RF). The role of the Project and of its beneficiaries in this was so
        critical that the National Committee for Defense Against Plant Disease cites the Project as a
        key instrument in the fight against the disease for Burundi, both through the support to SPs,
        but also to ISABU. Under PRASAB financing, the Project reports ISABU‘s multiplication of
        disease-resistant tubers to cover 3,300 ha. What proportion of the country‘s stock of clean
        disease-resistant tubers therefore comes from PRASAB activities? In other words, to what
        extent did the Project restore the Recipient‘s productive capacity [sic] in this regard? The
        indicator and target on cassava productivity (12 MT/ha) can not inform on this.

       Finally there are further gaps in the M&E design with respect to the measurement of outcomes
       to training and capacity support for better service provision to SPs. While this is always a
       difficult impact to measure, some attempt beyond input indicators (number of hours of training
       provided) would better inform the PDO. This is attempted in Figure 1 and Section 3 with
       reference to SP profitability (average and specific) and some beneficiary survey response.
M&E Implementation
27.     Despite the weaknesses in design, M&E implementation by the Government‘s Project team is
satisfactory. For example, in addition to information on the formally revised indicators, the Project
made a consistent and exemplary effort to collect data on all the disparate indicators in the different
documents, both pre and post-2008 revision. The ICR further finds that the Project team was proactive
in recognizing that the formal RF did not cover the full PDO/GEO for environmental sustainability and
                                                        11
attempted to fill the gap by measuring soil erosion.18 As discussed in Section F of the Datasheet, it was
the Project team that correctly measured and interpreted the third revised PDO indicator ―number of
returnees and displaced persons reintegrated in their communities‖ at a higher standard than either the
Bank or the independent evaluation teams. Rather than stopping at the ‗input‘ of 215,516 households
receiving emergency kits and group formation/capacity support from PRASAB, the Project team
tracked and reported the ‗reintegration‘ aspect of the PDO indicator by counting only those households
of the 215,516 that were sowing for two successive seasons, were able to procure their own seeds, and
able to replace their own tools, to arrive at a figure of 43,103 households, thereby (correctly) making
the PDO indicator an outcome indicator.19 The Project is commended for that effort as the formally
approved RF does not provide guidance to that high a standard of interpretation.
The Bank team‘s approach to the confusion in M&E design can be seen in the ISRs (see Table 9 in
Annex 10). Namely, to retain more or less consistently a streamlined set of the most relevant indicators.
That is, after an initial attempt to track the seven ―key indicators‖ found in the PAD text, the Project
teams quickly realized the intractability of these and rationalized the indicators reported in ISRs. The
2008 additional financing package formalized these modifications and the indicators approved in 2008
survived to Project-end reasonably intact, with the exception of dropping all coffee specificity and
some vegetables in the productivity list as these did not manifest through CDD. While, arguably, the
Project could have been restructured much earlier to formally correct the M&E weaknesses (see
Section 5), the relative importance of identifying the problem early and correcting for it is noted here.
Finally, the Bank team was also vigilant in ensuring adequate beneficiary input by recommending the
Project undertake independent beneficiary and impact assessments to amplify their M&E information
for decision making. It is this solid implementation which makes it possible to construct a results chain
with informative indicators (on which data is available) to assess the Project‘s outcomes in Section 3
despite persistent weaknesses in the Project‘s M&E design.
M&E Utilization

28.     The consistent tracking of a core set of indicators, formalized in 2008, made relevant decision
data available, as can be seen from Project Aide Memoires. Examples cited throughout the ICR of
corrective measures taken through implementation indicate that the Project well-utilized the data it
collected to inform its decisions (e.g the successful correction described in Box 1 resulted from the
Project‘s use of data on the number of SPs implemented, as compared to those approved).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.   The project was an Environmental Category B, triggering 5 safeguard policies at Project Start:
OP/BP 4.01 Environmental assessment, OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, OP/BP 4.09 Pest
Management, OP/BP 4.37 Safety of Dams, and OP/BP/GP 7.5020 Projects on International Waterways.
The Project team prepared all the appropriate safeguard instruments, and documents were correctly

18
   The Project applied the pin-method on a number of sites. Unfortunately, despite precautionary measures (heavy
cementing), most of the pins were stolen before reliable erosion control measures could be taken. The few surviving pins
measured an average of 160mm/year of soil deposition (i.e. soil that would have eroded) on one site. This unusually high
measure is not fully reliable given attempts to steal the pins and is cited here, rather, as evidence of commendable efforts to
implement comprehensive M&E by the NPCMU.
19
   This figure is 150 percent of the original project target, and 92 percent of the formally revised target of 47,000 households.
20
   Although the Project involved rehabilitation of small-scale water management schemes which drew water from several
international rivers, these activities were determined to have met the requirements for an exception to notification to the
other Riparians under paragraph 7 of OP 7.50 in both 2004 and 2008. That is, project activities did not adversely change the
quality or quantity of water flows to the other Riparians, and did not adversely affect the other Riparians' possible water use .
                                                              12
disclosed both in-country and at the Bank‘s Infoshop. The same is true for redisclosure of the
Environmental Assessment report and the Resettlement Policy Framework at Additional Financing.
Compliance with all environmental and social safeguards, as well as overall safeguard compliance, was
consistently rated as satisfactory over the entire life of the Project, with only two exceptions early on. A
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) rating for OP 4.09 and OP 7.50 were given in 2007. In the case of OP
4.09, the MU rating resulted from a lack of training in integrated pest management, which had resulted
in some loss of assets. For OP 7.50, the MU rating was due to the absence of a long-term water
resources management strategy for the Project. Satisfactory resolution of both was noted by the
environmental safeguards specialist in Back to Office reports and Aide Memoires. In addition to
consistently satisfactory compliance, Bank supervision documents note the successful adoption of
Project-produced training materials on a variety of safeguard issues, by 80,000 beneficiaries across
8,500 organizations.

30.     Part way through project implementation (FY08) the social safeguards specialist recommended
that OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous People be triggered and that an Indigenous People Plan (IPP) be
produced to promote participation of the Batwa. The IPP was duly developed and publicly disclosed on
April 1, 2008. Although the 2008 additional financing package for the project clearly states the IPP
preparation and disclosure, the updated Integrated Safeguards Datasheet for the additional financing
(showing the newly triggered OP 4.10 and describing measures taken by the borrower to address it)
was developed but not disclosed, which is why OP 4.10 is not reflected in the project ISRs. The ICR
team reviewed back to office reports and Aide Memoires and found that the implementation of OP 4.10
mitigation measures was consistently rated satisfactory.

31.     There were no serious fiduciary issues raised for the Project, and the financial management
ratings were consistently satisfactory across the life of the project, with one Highly Satisfactory early
on in the Project and a Marginally Satisfactory at the end of 2008. The 2008 Aide memoire and its
fiduciary annex document a delay in submitting one of the quarterly reports and noted some
computational errors therein. The same Aide Memoire summarizes the independent audit for that
period, which confirmed the fiduciary soundness of the Project‘s audited accounts but notes format
errors and omissions to be corrected. By the next mission the Project had undertaken the remedial
measures recommended in the audit and FM ratings remained satisfactory to the end of the Project life.
Procurement under the project was mainly for Consultancy Services and Community Based
Procurement. Procurement was rated as satisfactory throughout the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
32.    In order not to create a gap in the Bank‘s support (as per the CAS) to Burundi‘s rural
development, the Bank prepared a second operation, Agro-pastoral and Markets Development Project
(PRODEMA) to overlap the PRASAB operation. To a great extent, PRASAB informed PRODEMA, as
can be seen from the PAD where PRASAB is referred to as the ‗first stage‘ in the Bank‘s support to
post-conflict sectoral reconstruction. The PRODEMA PAD is explicit in its reference to lessons learned
from PRASAB. Specifically, in PRASAB‘s success in using grassroots organizations and a matching
grant CDD approach and its superior experience of private sector LIAs delivery over public.
PRODEMA‘s ‗next stage‘ of marketing builds on PRASAB‘s restoration of basic capacity.

33.    In terms of sustainability, PRODEMA Component 1 activities are designed to include support
by LIAs ‗responsible for managing and consolidating PRASAB‘s sub-project portfolio‘; and this
includes capacity for management of PRASAB irrigation schemes. PRODEMA‘s focus on marketing

                                                    13
of output provides a further needed sustainability support to the investments under PRASAB and
targets these. The PRODEMA project provides transition in implementation by maintaining
PRASAB‘s implementation structure, implementation team and geographic coverage. Finally, like
PRASAB, PRODEMA finances activities that follow on with capacity building efforts of public
institutions including the MAE and ISABU. This is important for consolidating the gains made in
PRASAB at central level on planning and policy capacity for the agricultural sector (see Section 3).

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
34.     The context of post-conflict reconstruction persists in Burundi at Project-end. Burundi is still
predominantly rural, with some 90 percent of the country‘s 1.2 million households living in rural areas
and engaged in low-yielding multi- crop subsistence agriculture. As at appraisal, agriculture still
accounts for almost 50 percent of GDP and its farming systems are dictated by weather cycles.21 While
the majority of refugees and IDPs have returned to Burundi and their reintegration has advanced 22 over
the situation at appraisal, DPs in Burundi estimate there are some 37,000 returnees in refugee camps in
Tanzania and many of the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction documented at appraisal remain.
The Bank‘s most recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) for Burundi documents overall
sluggish growth of Burundi‘s economy over the past years, which is largely ascribed to limited
progress in agricultural productivity. 23 The country has had weak agriculture growth of less than 3
percent over 2006-2009. 24 Because of the role of agriculture in rural poverty reduction, the core
development objective of PRASAB is consistent with Burundi‘s priorities even today, as outlined in
the World Bank‘s CAS for Burundi. The first objective of the CAS is to support the increase the
productivity of both food and high value export crops. Furthermore, agriculture is still first of the four
growth sector pillars identified in the Government‘s most recent PRSP (2011). In summary, the
objective of PRASAB was highly relevant to the situation in Burundi at the time, and remained so
through the life of the project.

35.     The design of the project, which focused on a CDD approach to restoring agricultural
productivity in communities that were recovering from a post conflict situation, was the appropriate
design for the situation. It allowed communities to rebuild cohesion, allowed returnees to reintegrate
and allowed a quick recovery of production. The clear link between the design of the project inputs and
outcomes is illustrated in Figure 1 above. Implementation was also an important factor in achieving the
project objectives in a fast changing context. With a few exceptions, adjustments were made quickly in
order to increase the effectiveness of project interventions and were an important part of achieving the
project outcomes. This implementation effectiveness is discussed in more detail under the
implementation agency ratings below.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives
36.     Primary among the issues concerning the articulation and coverage of the PDO and GEO
discussed in Section 2.3, is that the PDO indicators could be supplemented in assessing the PDO to
‗restore productive capacity‘ in rural Burundi and in addressing the causes of land degradation. This

supplementing is possible through a number of independent evaluations (see Annex 9) commissioned
throughout implementation, but particularly at and after MTR on the Bank‘s recommendation. The ICR
team reviewed these evaluations and finds them, qualitatively, to be comprehensive and the associated
survey instruments to be of good quality. They are not, however, statistically generalizable, given that
samples are representative, not random. The ICR cites results accordingly. Quantitatively, the
independent assessments are exhaustive in component activity/output description, providing an
independent basis for Project-reported figures in the Government ICR. These allow for some
confidence, for example, in calculating carbon sequestration (i.e., based on independently verified
reported ha for Project SLM coverage). In general, the representative samples covered by the
independent assessments tend to confirm Project and ISR-reported indicators and issues. Where
necessary (e.g., calculating carbon sequestration), external data sources for the sub-region are used.
World Bank analyses (e.g., CEM) are also used extensively.

37.     Based on modest to good progress on the three (correctly specified) formally revised PDO
indicators; and on positive evidence from the supplementary RC indicators and data, the PDO of the
project was substantively achieved. Based on the excellent performance of the two GEO indicators
drawn from the PAD, supported by an assessment of the intermediate outcome indicators and
supplementary environmental data, the GEO of the Project was achieved. For both, as discussed
above, the PDO and GEO are assessed for project-affected areas and not the rural space in Burundi as a
whole, although some Project activities can be seen to have had national impact.
38.     A review of the evidence on the three revised PDO indicators provides a starting point.
Productivity increases of main agricultural and livestock products in project areas (revised PDO
indicator 1) measured at Project-end represent seven (of nine) formally approved commodities (see
Section F of ICR Datasheet). Five of the seven show productivity improvements over the 2008
baseline, with cassava (see Box 2) and beans having project-end results equal to baseline level, despite
the disease and climate shocks documented, respectively. Table 2 shows attainment levels of revised
targets for the PDO indicator. Productivity improvements range from modest (40 to 50 percent
attainment of target yield) for those commodities most affected by rain variations (tomatoes, onions
and especially, beans (whose ‗attainment‘ equates no progress over baseline—See Section F in
Datasheet and Section 2.2) to good (78 percent-100 percent) for the other four.25

             Table 2 PDO Indicator 1 Results: Productivity of Main Agricultural and Livestock Products

                          Cassava              12.0 MT/ha          10.0 MT/ha                 83 percent

39.    For PDO indicator 2, beneficiaries‘ net profit at Project end was 26 percent, only marginally up
from the 2008 baseline of 25 percent. As per the discussion on M&E in Section 2.1 above, however,
the 25 percent baseline does not inform on the PDO. A baseline of zero provides the ‗without Project
scenario‘ for this indicator, in which case the correct interpretation of the reported project-end value of
26 percent for beneficiary net profit would be that the Project achieved 85 percent of the final net profit


25
 Attempts to compare productivity gains reported by the Project against nationwide productivity figures (with/without)
were constrained by what ICR assessed to be unreliable data on productivity in Burundi, even from international sources.
                                                            15
rate target of 30 percent.26 This is a conservative interpretation since the ICR found that the value of 26
percent includes a large portion of financed SPs (38 percent) that have not been completely executed
(e.g., still prior to first harvest at the time of calculation).

40.     The third revised PDO indicator achieved 92 percent of its 2008 formally revised target of
47,000 households of returnees and IDPs reintegrated into their communities (upgraded from 28,000
originally). The Project ultimately delivered support to over 215,000 households, and this is in fact the
value reported in the independent evaluations and the Bank‘s last ISR for PDO indicator 3. As
discussed above, the Government‘s ICR voluntarily applied the higher (correct) standard of
interpretation of the PDO indicator in measuring the ‗reintegration‘ aspect of the PDO indicator. The
reported result of 92 percent counts only those households that have achieved some level of integration
as defined by sowing activities for at least two successive seasons, the ability to procure their own
seeds, and to replace their own tools. More generally, the 2010 independent evaluation estimated that
support from PRASAB‘s sub-component 1.2 activities impacted on almost 20 percent of all of
Burundi‘s war-displaced people. 27 Further to the formally revised indicator, after an assessment in
200728 on these activities flagged the poor participation of returnees and IDPs in SP application, the
Project made special efforts to support group formation and capacity of these groups to apply for SP
support under Component 1. These efforts resulted in 67 SPs approved for these groups, 66 percent of
the RF target for this indicator. Perhaps more importantly the independent assessments noted an
increase in ‗social cohesion‘ resulting from Project support:

         Support from PRASAB was a tool for creating and reinforcing social cohesion. In the
         context of restoring and developing the agricultural sector, most war-displaced
         households created producer organizations in the hopes of developing sub projects to
         submit to the CCAP. The resulting association permitted the creation and strengthening
         of social cohesion among members of the POs in general, and particularly among those
         POs that received [PRASAB] financing. The evaluation notes the presence of groups
         whose members are drawn from all three ethnicities (Tutsi, Batwa and Hutu).29

41.     Based on the evidence available from multiple sources on the three formally revised PDO
indicators, the ICR finds the targets were largely met, despite the difficult context described.

42.    Yet, as argued in Section 2.3, these three PDO indicators do not tell the full story of PDO and
GEO achievement. In particular, while productivity is obviously the ultimate goal, a more
comprehensive set of PDO indicators informing on actual ‗productive capacity‘ would be useful. To
that end, the ICR summarized data on four further indicators based on the notion of ‗productive
capacity‘ built through group formation and CDD execution; and ‗productive capacity‘ in terms of
replacement of agricultural capital stock looted and lost during the civil crisis. 30 These indicators


26
   Using the 25 percent baseline tell us that the Project increased the net profitability rate of sub projects relative to the
subprojects implemented by 2008 by 20 percent. See discussion in Section 2.1.

This figure is plausible since 215,000 households represent only slightly less than the full documented number of returnees
and IDPs at appraisal, an estimate that grew over the Project implementation period with the identification of large numbers
of Burundians still in camps in Tanzania.

   These additional indicators do not, of course, cover the full scope of ‗productive capacity‘ either. For example, the 2007
beneficiary assessment of Component 1(b) activities compares the results of project beneficiaries having received
                                                              16
include: (i) measures of net profitability of SPs (PDO Indicator 2 and Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
of SPs) and SP rate of failure, in order to measure community capacity to implement productive
activities; the relative contribution of the Project to the national stock of (ii) disease-resistant cassava
and (iii) livestock. Despite the PDO‘s logical interpretation as ‗for project areas‘, Project impact has
been found to be sufficiently important as to register nationally in terms of capital stock. In sum:

     The average net profitability (conservatively) reported at Project-end of SPs financed under the
      project is 26 percent. The weighted average FRR of the main SP categories from the ICR
      economic and financial analysis (EFA) is 78 percent. The reported ‗failure rate‘ of SPs is very low
      at 2.4 percent. These indicators point to good capacity for conceptualization and implementation
      of productive activity (i.e., human ‗productive capacity‘) that can be to some extent attributed to
      the Project‘s intensive training and support activities to POs, CBOs and to the public and private
      LIAs. More concrete causality analysis (in terms of other support factors) requires data and
      regression analysis not available in the ICR, but given the verified approach of geographic
      partition among development initiatives, at least partial causality is not implausible for the impact
      of Project training activities on the productive human capacity PDO aspect in project areas.
     Cassava production in Burundi was under mosaic attack since 2002. The National Committee for
      Defense Against Plant Disease of the MAE estimates the country‘s food security needs for
      cassava to be equivalent to some 90,000 ha of disease-resistant plantation. PRASAB, through its
      cassava SPs and its support to ISABU is responsible for the multiplication of enough disease
      resistant cassava to cover 4 percent of the national territory (3,800 ha).
     The most recent (2007) estimates31 of the country‘s national stock for cattle and goats are 480,000
      and 1.6 million heads, respectively. In 1993 (prior to the end of conflict) these numbers were
      434,000 and 900,000 respectively. The 2007 figures therefore represent the partial recuperation of
      the national stock of these animals. Over the course of the Project, cattle financed by PRASAB
      resulted in 13,100 heads (or 3 percent of the estimated national stock of cattle) and goats financed
      by PRASAB resulted in 183,000 head (or fully 11 percent of the most recent national stock
      figure).32

43.     The PDO, with its focus on productive capacity, is also an environmental objective in the
Burundian context since the only way to prevent encroachment on fragile lands for production is to
increase the productivity of arable land. This is why the attainment of the PDO reflects also the
introduction of SLM, and is therefore measured by the Project‘s intermediate outcome indicators.
Despite the absence of clear formal GEO indicators, the ICR does attempt to further measure the
Project‘s progress on ‗address[ing] the causes of land degradation‘ using these intermediate objectives
indicators on SLM, and supplemental data on vegetative cover and carbon sequestration (see Figure
1):33



agricultural kits and Project support with those of a control group. The key difference identified by the study between
beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries is a higher re-investments rate of (seed) production surplus. I.e. the Project had a
measurable impact on the productive capacity [sic] among beneficiaries (as shown by reproduction of seed, a key input).
31
   FAO. 2010. Burundi : Document d’orientations stratégiques pour le secteur de l’élevage. FAO : Rome.
32
   Even accounting for any growth in the national stock to 2011, this is unlikely to outweigh the reported growth rates of the
Project‘s livestock investments of 37 percent for cattle and 64 percent for goats (through normal animal reproduction and
controlled animal mortality rates achieved in the Project).
33
   These follow logically from the factors contributing to land degradation documented in the PAD: (i) deforestation and
reduced vegetative cover due to strong population pressures, exacerbated by (ii) conflict which prevented normal
agricultural activity and further contributed to harvesting and degradation of natural resources. The (iii) hilly environment of
                                                              17
      GEO Indicator 1 on vegetative cover can be calculated using the intermediate outcomes on
       SLM (which were more than fully attained, see Datasheet Section F) and supplemental data on
       Project forestry activities. In addition to the 11,279 ha of SLM reported in the RF, some 93,000
       ha reforested (forestry and agroforestry) under the Project‘s 622 forestry SPs and 1774 ha
       forested on the Project‘s 10 watershed demonstration sites were planted. Putting these together
       results in 104,805 ha of increased vegetative cover in Burundi from the Project. This
       represents fully 11 percent of all arable land in Burundi, and completely restores the
       estimated 30,000 ha deforested during two years of conflict (1993-1994);34
     Carbon sequestration was estimated at 2.6 million tons over a 20 year growth cycle for the 622
       forestry subprojects alone (i.e., it was not estimated for the total vegetative cover achieved by
       the Project, and as such is a conservative estimate of carbon sequestration benefits); and
     The 2009 independent evaluation documents that the Project‘s soil erosion pin-method
       measurement yielded a positive soil deposition (i.e., soil that would have eroded) measure. The
       ICR finds the precise measure unreliable (see footnote 18), but the broad direction of the
       measure is confirmed by interview responses 35 that document beneficiary observations on
       reduced siltation in valley bottoms since project start.
44.    From these supplementary observations, the ICR concludes that the Project satisfactorily
achieved the GEO of addressing the causes of land degradation and contributed to sustainable land
management in Burundi.

The Project‘s remaining intermediate outcomes complete the picture on achievement of the PDO:
    Water management: As was seen in the PDO indicator 1 on productivity, water management is
       key to productive capacity in Burundi. The Project developed 1,573 ha of irrigation, fully 129
       percent of its revised target;
    Institutional Strengthening: Productive capacity in rural Burundi (as elsewhere) depends on
       greater capacity among service providers and better enabling policies and frameworks for
       agriculture and land use. With respect to the latter, the Project achieved almost all of its
       intermediate outcomes (see Datasheet Section F). Of particular note in terms of policy
       framework, is the Project achievement of having the MAE put a National Strategy for
       Agricultural Investment (NAS) in place by 2008, at which point the targets were changed to
       improved sectoral allocation to agricultural expenditure and better development partner
       coordination, both fully successful. The ICR notes that the NAS permitted Burundi‘s CAADP
       participation and formed the basis for the development of the Agricultural Investment Plan. DPs
       interviewed for the ICR emphasize the critical role of the PRASAB-financed NAS and the
       follow-on investment plan to which it led, in ‗vastly improving‘ donor coordination and
       dialogue within the sector.

3.3 Efficiency

45.    The ICR updated the original economic and financial analysis (EFA). Neither version attempted
to quantify the financial or economic net benefits of the Project as a whole. Instead, a 20-year
discounted cash flow model of 10 representative sub-projects was used to assess the productive SPs of
Component 1. Both the original and the ICR EFA therefore exclude SLM investments and emergency


Burundi naturally adds erosion control (or the lack thereof) to the mix. The selected indicators are a subset directly drawn
from the Project‘s own GEO Key Indicators.

support for returnees and IDPs, although capacity building and project management costs are included
in the ICR EFA. The choice of representative SPs was updated at ICR to reflect actual project
implementation and covers 78 percent36 of the productive SPs financed by PRASAB (see Annex 2 for
complete list of assumptions and further details). Results indicated a high overall return on investment,
and individual SP returns were higher than in the original PAD analysis. The calculated total economic
NPV was BIF 43.7 billion (US$35.5 million) with an ERR of 58 percent. Most of the economic NPV
was generated by cattle, post harvest rice shelling, and goat herd SPs (55 percent, 17 percent and 16
percent, respectively). Switching values were identified for each SP separately. The most sensitive
variables were output prices: a 14 percent reduction in rice price leads to negative returns in the
irrigated rice sub-projects; and a 28 percent reduction in honey price reduces economic NPV of
apiculture sub-projects to zero. Similarly, the project ERR was most sensitive to changes in unit output
prices where a 50 percent reduction in all prices brought the project ERR to 16 percent (close, but still
above, the 12 percent break-even point). Project returns are less sensitive to both investment and input
price increases.

46.     The ICR EFA understates the total benefits of the Project, particularly in terms of
environmental benefits from SLM investments, support to IDPs, some multi-level capacity building,
knowledge transferred outside the project area, and benefits realized beyond the 20-year time frame. In
an attempt to illustrate some of the excluded benefits, a rough estimate of economic NPV that includes
the 622 forestry sub-projects was calculated. The NPV rose from BIF 43.7 million to BIF 72 billion by
including BIF 19 billion from carbon sequestration of 2.6 million tons of carbon over 20 years. This
calculation excludes other potential environmental benefits. It was not possible to obtain separate
benefit and cost estimates for the 9,866 ha that incorporated incremental anti-erosion and SLM
measures due to data constraints. This constraint applied also to the 10 demonstration watershed sites
covering forestry and anti erosion on 3,187 ha.

47.       In terms of efficiency, a number of issues were reviewed.
         A comparison to unit price/cost data from Rwanda showed no evidence that the project was
          inefficient in its investment or input costs. On the contrary the unit cost of marshland irrigation
          rehabilitation is significantly lower in PRASAB, than for similar activity in Rwanda;37
         The efficiency analysis of the EFA indicated a potential for higher project returns if output
          prices were to rise relative to the Rwandan comparator, providing an empirical basis for the
          increased emphasis on marketing in Section 6 Lessons Learned (already internalized in the
          follow on project (PRODEMA) in its marketing emphasis).
         The ICR can speculate whether the observed need for more continuous capacity support in
          certain productive activities (see Section 5.1 (b) and 6 below) could have helped further
          increase the returns to the project‘s SP activity. While the ICR- ERR is certainly sufficiently
          high, it may be true that greater depth in training support may have resulted in higher returns
          still, particularly for beneficiaries using public LIAs, who were seen to have had a weaker
          support performance than the private LIAs. There was insufficient data to assess such a claim
          but is flagged here as a possibility that impacts less on the Project‘s positive development
          outcomes and more on the lessons learned for future operations.



36
   The remaining 22% are made up by numerous SPs for which only a few examples were undertaken. The added cost of
constructing the elaborate activity models required for the EFA for a large number of low-frequency SPs outweighed the
additional information these small activities could add to the EFA.

      Observations on the pedal pump technology chosen for some irrigation SPs include an
       estimated 10 percent breakdown frequency which imply delays and loss of productivity while
       awaiting repairs and parts, which are not locally available. Obviously, local sourcing would
       improve efficiency in these SPs. While no local manufacturers are currently available, sub-
       regional solutions and in-country value chain capacity may prove useful.
      Finally, the ICR notes that the Project was able to effectively reinsert returnees and IDPs into
       productive activity at a much lower cost than the original Government/UN estimates of the
       US$1,200 per household at appraisal.

   Based on these observations, overall the efficiency of the Project in the achievement of its PDO and
   GEO are substantial.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome of Rating of Moderately Satisfactory and Global Environment
Outcome Rating of Satisfactory.
48.      The Project objectives and design are consistent with the key current development priorities in
Burundi, as evidenced by the Bank‘s assistance strategies and the Government‘s own poverty reduction
and post-conflict reconstruction strategies (See Section 3.1). The ICR finds that the Project has
substantially achieved the objective put forth in the PDO on restoring productive capacity in project-
affected rural areas and in the GEO statement on addressing the causes of land degradation in these
areas. The three revised PDOs indicator targets have been moderately well met in the case of
productivity, and largely met in terms of (correctly specified) net profit, and returnee and IDP
reintegration. Given the PDO indicator coverage issues discussed in Section 2.3, however, additional
indicators used by the ICR provide a more complete coverage of the notion of productive capacity and
land degradation and provide additional justification for the Moderately Satisfactory rating. Indicators
on rural community capacity for conceptualization and implementation of productive activities and
projects through successful CDD SPs, as well as capital stock indicators for cassava planting materials
(key to food security) and livestock show success in the Project‘s restoration of different aspects of
‗productive capacity‘ that are fully aligned with the documented constraints at appraisal and project-
end. Datasheet Section F also shows that most revised intermediate outcome targets for the Project
were either met or surpassed, including the higher level policy framework targets. The Project‘s
institutional objectives in terms of policy planning and frameworks were all met or exceeded and their
importance to the sector has been confirmed by DPs operating in Burundi. In addition, an FRR of 78
percent for sub-projects supports the fact that sub-projects were very successful investments, and
supporting the argument that indicator 2 on net income was incorrectly specified in the project design.
In terms of the GEO rating of satisfactory, independent evaluations provide positive evidence on the
Project‘s role in significantly increasing SLM and vegetative cover in Burundi, and contributing to
carbon sequestration. Finally, the ICR finds that overall; the Project was efficient in its use of resources,
in some cases achieving higher results at lower cost than estimated at appraisal (e.g., reintegration of
IDPs and returnees). The EFA for the Project was carefully updated for the ICR and found that, even in
excluding the positive externalities/benefits from the environmental contributions, the ERR is well
above the opportunity cost of capital, and comparators with nearby Rwanda failed to turn up any
evidence of inefficiency in delivering outcomes. While Section 6 identifies lessons for the
sustainability of these outcomes, the assembled body of evidence supports the conclusion that the
PRASAB Project has satisfactorily met its development and environmental objectives for project areas
as embodied in the approved PDO and GEO.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

                                                    20
49.     Poverty reduction, increased incomes, and improved food security are among the Project‘s
higher order objectives (see Figure 1) and so do not figure among the measurable parameters of the
Project, nor of the ICR. 38 The ICR has, however, reviewed the Project impacts on both gender and
social cohesion documented in the independent assessments and beneficiary responses therein.39

50.     Just over one third of all SPs financed by the Project have been initiated and managed by
women. Women are reported to make up 44 percent of PO membership under the Project, and 31
percent of CBOs. These figures are even higher among the returnee and IDP households, where 45
percent of SPs for this group are initiated and headed by women (who are also head of household in
most cases). Women interviewed in the 2010 beneficiary survey, particularly among those engaged in
livestock; report that the initial opposition of their husbands in their participation in the POs has been
replaced by a greater respect towards the women and a greater participation in household spending
decisions.40 Women make up between 30 and 50 percent of training recipients in most of the Project‘s
trainings, with the notable exception of forestry and agroforestry training, where only 5 percent of
training recipients were women.


51.     The Project‘s activities appear to have had an important impact in building social cohesion in
the communities in which it operated. This is most obvious for the 215,516 households of returnees and
IDPs. Many of them landless, either permanently or pending conflict resolution over land, they do not
have the means to economically re-engage. Assessments report that the Project‘s agricultural kits
provided households with the means to reintegrate into their communities, not only in terms of the local
(agricultural) economic activity, but in joining CBOs and community work. Hoes and other implements
in the kit enabled even landless households to participate in public works opportunities, for example,
that they otherwise would have been excluded from. Among the representative households interviewed
for the 2010 evaluation, fully 100 percent of returnees, IDPs and indigenous people having received the
kits reported joining POs as a result. This reinforces the result cited in Section 3.2 concerning the
Project‘s economic incentive to broad based group formation and social cohesion.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Please see Sections 2.5 and 3.2 for a discussion on institutional strengthening, particularly with respect
to the policy frameworks developed by the Project. See also Datasheet Section F.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Please refer to preceding section (a) on social cohesion.

Please see Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The ICR finds the risk that development outcomes (DOs) will not be maintained to be moderate:


38
   The results of beneficiary surveys do convey some perceptions of improvement in food security and poverty reduction.
For example, in the 2010 study, 55 percent of returnees and IDPs surveyed reported having two meals a day, up from the
baseline of 35 percent in 2007. The same figure for three meals rose to 10 percent from the 2007 baseline of 7 percent.
Some 58 percent of POs members interviewed in 2010 report a 100 percent increase in their milk consumption. All these
figures are based on a non-random representative sample, however, and are therefore more indicative that definitive.

        Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Rural Development: As discussed above, the Project design
         intentionally targeted the micro, meso and macro levels to ensure sustainability of DOs. The
         project provided the basic tools and capacity for environmentally sustainable restoration of
         productive capacity for women and men, but also assisted the line ministries with their policy and
         planning tools, as well as the key policy frameworks to do so (e.g. NAS). Land use plans and
         environmental frameworks follow in the same vain. While the institutional support of the
         PRASAB project contributes directly to an enabling environment for sustained DOs, a note of
         caution informs the risk rating to moderate as there is ongoing work to ensure the ownership and
         operationalization of several key frameworks; including the provincial land use plans.
        Continuous Post-Operation Support: As discussed above, the PRODEMA operation uses the
         same implementation team and covers at least the same provinces as PRASAB. LIAs hired by
         PRODEMA provide follow-on support to PRASAB SPs as part of their contracted tasks,
         including operation and maintenance (O&M) 41 of PRASAB-financed irrigation schemes, and
         marketing for SP outputs.
        Output Prices: Related to the marketing activities referenced above, the risk rating is also
         informed by price risks outside the Project‘s control (as well as their likely impact). The updated
         EFA assisted the ICR in attaching a likely impact to risks through sensitivity analysis. The long
         run projected returns to the Project were found to be most sensitive to changes in output prices,
         which are only partially in control of the Project (i.e., with reference to better access to markets).
         Deteriorating prices for commodities are to some extent globally determined and there will be
         residual risk related to output prices that the Project cannot control. With the current elevated
         levels of food prices, however, this risk is remote.
        Conflict. The residual risk, over which the Project has little control, is that of resumption of
         conflict, at least in some parts of the country.
These combined factors contribute to the ICR‘s moderate rating for risks to development outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52.    While identification and technical preparation/appraisal under a very difficult security situation
was found to be highly satisfactory, the ICR finds that there were important shortcomings in the
preparation related to M&E design and project documentation at entry. Strong points in QAE include:
    Strong strategic relevance, as evidenced by the constraints identified in Burundi at preparation
       and their enduring relevance (see Section 3.1). Conflict experts at the Bank particularly note the
       best practice of the Project in ―pre-positioning a peace building operation in advance of a real
       cessation of hostilities‖.42
    Reasonable estimation of benefits at appraisal, as confirmed by the ICR EFA.
    Astute social assessment of the sensitive issues at appraisal is evidenced by the focus of support
       to community based organizations and on the very real issue of returning refugees and IDPs.



41
   ICR interviews with DPs in Burundi flag the simultaneous appreciation of the Project‘s attention to water management
infrastructure but signals the need for strong water user associations and attention to O&M.
42
   See ICR Peer Review comments in WBDocs.
                                                           22
       Both received explicit analysis and resources in the design of project activities. The selection of
       the PDO to focus on restoring productive capacity cuts to core of Burundi‘s poverty challenge.
      Highly satisfactory attention to environmental aspects was facilitated by the decision to blend
       GEF funds and ensure incremental resources to the Project‘s activities for environmental
       stewardship and SLM, and evidenced by better than average analysis in the PAD on the
       environmental challenges and issues in Burundi.
      Appropriate multi-level approach including policy and institutional aspects.
      Satisfactory fiduciary aspects as signaled by consistently satisfactory rating throughout the
       seven years of implementation (with one early exception discussed above).
      Accurate risk assessment and mitigation that was validated by rapid early disbursement and
       additional financing in 2008. The Project‘s CDD approach with designated resources for group
       formation and capacity support and technical assistance for SP articulation and implementation
       all show accurate cognizance of the limitations to Government capacity for large scale
       intervention of this nature in a post-conflict context.

53.     On the other hand (i) weak Project M&E design (documented in Section 2.3 and in Annex 10);
and (ii) poor consistency between the main body and annexes of the PAD and (importantly) between
the PAD and the legal agreements, downgrades an otherwise highly satisfactory QAE to moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision Rating: Satisfactory
The ICR finds many aspects of Bank supervision to be highly satisfactory, including:
    Safeguards: Any deficiencies appeared to be quickly diagnosed and corrective support applied
      without delay, including the triggering of additional policies when necessary (see Section 2.4
      for evidence and discussion).
    Technical: Documented instances, supported by interviews with the Project team, of the Bank
      team maximizing returns to investments (e.g., encouraging beneficiaries to maximize use of the
      second (non irrigated) season on rehabilitated perimeters); improving decision making (e.g.,
      recommending external evaluation at MTR); and relieving bottlenecks in implementation (e.g.,
      documented procurement and FM support in Aide Memoires) despite an extremely challenging
      security environment that precluded easy and frequent site access.
    Process: The Government Project team reports good early implementation support in the post
      conflict context. Later, with the move from the transitional government at appraisal to the
      democratically elected government, strong implementation support and dialogue is evidenced
      by continuity in disbursement around the transition.
    Supervision for Sustainability: The task team was vigilant in resolving and negotiating issues on
      continuity in implementation for the PRODEMA project through the successful PRASAB team,
      despite initial resistance from the Government.
    Good partner coordination, particularly in returnee and IDP activities, confirmed by ICR
      interview with development partners (see also footnote 15).

54.     On the development impact side, as noted earlier, evidence from the independent evaluations
indicate that among the small sample of less successful sub-projects (the ‗failure rate‘ on SPs is
estimated at under 3 percent), particularly livestock, a key factor was the lack of a more sustained
training model. The Project documents a vast amount of training provided, but there may have been a
need during implementation to fine tune the training approach for greater investment sustainability.
There was an opportunity to allocate greater resources and attention to the issue when the project was

                                                   23
restructured in 2008, where instead the issue of coffee privatization seemed to have taken over the
spotlight. The consequence was that at restructuring, a large sum was earmarked for training related to
coffee SPs, which did not figure as prominently as expected. In the end, in 2010 there was a
reallocation of resources away from training activities (that were earmarked for coffee) towards further
SP financing. These funds could have better been allocated at restructuring for in-depth training follow
up (rather than for a particular sub-sector like coffee). Second, while the task team quickly corrected
for the poorly designed indicators early on, restructuring for RF adjustment could have been an earlier
option during supervision.

55.      In sum, the ICR recognizes the ‗massive‘ need being addressed by the breadth of Project
activities and the demands this entails on supervision in a constrained security environment. It cites the
case of the Project‘s training approach and RF adjustments as the basis for a satisfactory rating, as
opposed to an otherwise highly satisfactory supervision performance.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance Rating: Satisfactory
56.     The Bank‘s design, preparation and implementation of the PRASAB project were evidence-
based, appropriate and responsive to the needs of post-conflict Burundi. In particular, the issue of
capacity building for public and private service provision for productive activity was well conceived
and well resourced, as were the risk-mitigating capacity activities for SP implementation from the
community to the provincial levels. The Bank showed good due diligence on technical, financial
management, procurement and safeguard aspects of implementation, and this, despite challenging
security environment that sometimes constrained field visits. The Bank had a demonstrated regard for
the Project‘s sustainability issues in its preparation of another agricultural operation (PRODEMA) near
the end of the Project‘s life. Although not explicitly a follow-on operation, the Bank team nevertheless
ensured continuity for the PRASAB investments through implementation arrangements and scope of
PRODEMA activities. The performance outcomes assessed in Section 3 evidence achievements of the
PDO and GEO. This highly satisfactory performance Bank-side is qualified by poor M&E design and
articulation and document inconsistencies. This was fortunately overcome during implementation with
the early identification and correction by the Bank team of weaknesses in M&E.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance Rating: Satisfactory

57.     The project went effective whilst the transitional government was still in place and before the
democratic election of the Government. This, given the post-conflict context, meant that the Project did
not have any Government counterpart funding (100 percent IDA and GEF). While the Government
performance and commitment was otherwise highly satisfactory under the circumstances, the ICR
identified some issues related to Government commitment and performance, including:
     The project‘s National Steering Committee (further to the Project‘s Technical Steering
        Committee), which only met twice over the seven year life of the Project due to the reported
        difficulty in arranging the meeting between several ministers.
     After allocating training funds to support wider Government reforms in the coffee sub-sector in
        the 2008 additional financing, the reforms were implemented more slowly than envisioned so
        that CDD demand for coffee SPs was lower than anticipated. The Project was able to reallocate
        resources in the 2010 restructuring, however, and effectively shift its activities to support other
        critical sub sectors based on its normal CDD processes.


                                                    24
      At the time of transition for the PRODEMA project, the Government expressed initial
       reluctance to maintain continuity in project management, creating delays and uncertainties on
       staffing.
      In five of the 10 provinces, the LIAs were public sector employees. Although they were
       provided with incentives, the quality of support to beneficiaries in these provinces was
       documented as lower than that of private LIAs. The MAE was not proactive in replacing them
       with private LIAs or in exacting performance from their decentralized staff.
      Government was slow to reimburse the VAT for the Project, placing the project out-of-pocket
       for its activities at the end of its life which threatened successful completion of activities, and
       placed a flag on pipeline operations to the Board. Eventually, the VAT was reimbursed.

58.     Based on these points, the ICR finds moderate shortcomings to the Government performance,
which in many other respects was highly satisfactory. This is particularly true in the latter part of the
Project‘s life but also during preparation when the task team recalls the Government‘s commitment to
attend and finalize preparation meetings despite the bombings in the capital.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance Rating: Highly Satisfactory

59.     The ICR finds the performance of the Project‘s implementation unit, the NPCMU and their
inter-provincial units, to be highly satisfactory. In particular:
     The NPCMU showed a clarity and commitment to the Project‘s PDO and GEO, having a
        clearer articulation and more comprehensive data collection systems than is conveyed by even
        the Bank‘s own ISRs. Even with initially weak M&E design, they did not stray from the PDO
        in the execution of their activities, so that in reviewing Project documents and evaluations, a
        clear alignment can be seen throughout implementation (as documented in Figure 1);
     Implementation is consistently rated as Satisfactory in all aspects in most ISRs, with evidence
        of quick correction and compliance when ratings fell marginally below Satisfactory;
     The Bank approved additional financing half way through the Project‘s life due to excellent
        disbursement and implementation;
     The government ICR is replete with frank examples of learning and timely resolution of
        implementation issues (e.g., early assessment of the factors leading to less successful SPs; the
        Project‘s diagnosis and correction for an initial sluggish fund flow; the Project‘s response to
        recommendations of the 2007 independent assessment of PRASAB activities with IDPs, etc.);
     DP partner interviews for the ICR confirm good collaboration of the NPCMU with partners in
        Burundi.
Based on this evidence, the implementation agency performance is rated as highly satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance Rating: Satisfactory

60.    Given the highly satisfactory performance of the Government‘s implementing agency and the
moderately satisfactory performance of the Government from the immediate post conflict period of
2004 through to 2011, the ICR rates the Government performance as satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned




                                                   25
61.     In its comprehensive review of the PRASAB Project, the ICR distills four key lessons 43 for
similar operations and one further lesson for internal processes at the Bank:
    1. Depth over breadth in training and capacity building. While the failure rate of Project-
        financed SPs is very low, a recurring explanation for failed or lower-than-expected returns for
        some SPs pertains to beneficiary capacity for adhering to good practices, particularly in
        livestock. While the Project provided over 275,000 person days of training, many of these agro-
        technical in nature, there was a need for sustained monitoring or mentoring that may have
        improved the efficiency of outcomes.
    2. Performance based contracts for better performance. The incentive to LIAs, both public and
        private, needs to be performance based. Outcome orientated contracts (in the case of private) or
        enforced performance agreements (in the case of public) would strengthen their accountability
        and performance towards beneficiaries.
    3. Sustaining sustainable land management. Project lessons show that SLM needs to be
        economically interesting to be sustainable: Where the economic incentives were lower in the
        Project, there was greater deterioration of Project-financed SLM infrastructure, and vice versa.
        Therefore, the Government ICR notes that SLM beneficiaries that also have livestock (to whom
        to feed the soil-fixing grasses that reinforce terraces, for example) tend to better sustain their
        SLM investments. Similarly, landowners appear to take better care of SLM infrastructures than
        renters. While beneficiary shortsightedness on the SLM gains of good environmental
        stewardship can and should be corrected by education such as that amply undertaken by the
        Project, the lesson here is that this educational approach should in every instance be reinforced
        by tangible economic benefits to the beneficiaries involved;44
    4. Marketing matters. Having a firm handle on the environmentally sustainable restoration of
        productive capacity in Burundi, future operations should lend further attention in SP approaches
        to facilitating market access (a lesson noted even before project end and taken on board in the
        Bank‘s PRODEMA operation in Burundi).
In terms of Bank processes:
     5. Teamwork. One further lesson emerging from the ICR review of Project M&E design relates
        to support units in the Bank. In exploring the issue of PRASAB‘s weak M&E design, the ICR
        team concludes that a contributing factor to the poor original design was the delivery of the
        Project at precisely the moment of transition from the ‗Project Design Summary‘ to the modern
        ‗Results Framework‘. The mid stream adjustment in Project preparation from the old format to
        the new that contributed at least in part to the confusion found in Project documents. There is a
        need for better ‗hands on‘ support to task teams when new M&E tools and formats are
        developed and when ‗new and improved‘ Bank processes are introduced more generally.
        Further to this, there is a need for greater accountability on the part of legal staff in faithfully
        replicating RF parameters from the PAD, which should prevail given that the PAD usually
        benefits from strong technical input and quality review, as well as buy-in from the Client.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies



43
   There are, of course, many more lessons than these four, particularly in confirming the benefits of the CDD approach in
post-conflict reconstruction. The Government‘s ICR alone is an excellent source of project-specific lessons (see summary in
Annex 7).
44
   Productivity gains on hillsides under similar SLM in neighboring Rwanda have been phenomenal—over 100 percent
increases in just one season.
                                                            26
No Major issues except the Government requested an upgrade in the Government‘s Performance Rating from
―Moderately Satisfactory‖ to ―Satisfactory‖. The Bank has taken this comment into consideration and revised
the rating to Satisfactory. (See Annex 7 for details)

                         IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION REPORT

                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

     Methodology
     1. As with the original economic and financial analysis (EFA), the current analysis did not
     attempt to quantify the financial or economic net benefits of the project as a whole. Instead, a 20-
     year discounted cash flow model of 10 representative sub-projects was used to assess the economic
     and financial impact of the productive investments of Component 1. 45 This analysis therefore
     excludes Sustainable Land Management (SLM) investments and emergency support for returnees
     and internally displaced people, although capacity building and project management costs are
     included. This model structure was maintained from the original economic and financial analysis
     conducted for the PAD in 2003 for comparability: the choice of representative sub-projects was
     updated to reflect actual project implementation. The ICR EFA covers 78 percent of the productive
     sub-projects financed by PRASAB.

     2. Results indicate a high overall return on investment, and individual sub-project returns
     were higher than in the original PAD analysis. Higher returns at Project-end were primarily due
     to increased revenue and costs but also due to changes in sub-project designs. The calculated total
     economic NPV at ICR was BIF 43.7 billion (US$35.5 million) with an ERR of 58 percent. The
     analysis covered 2,407 projects with year 1-5 investments of BIF 24.4 billion equal to US$20
     million. The investment included US$10.4 million direct investment costs and US$9.5 million other
     project costs for capacity building and project management. Most of the economic NPV was
     generated by cattle, post harvest rice shelling, and goat herd sub-projects (55 percent, 17 percent
     and 16 percent, respectively).

     3. A comparison to unit price/cost data from Rwanda showed no evidence that the project
     was inefficient in its investment or input costs. The analysis indicated a potential for higher
     project returns if marketing constraints were removed and output prices were left to increase, as
     these were lower than the Rwanda comparators. The ERR was most sensitive to changes in unit
     output prices where a 50 percent reduction in all prices brought the project ERR to 16 percent and
     close to the 12 percent break-even point. Compared to this, increased investment costs had less
     impact on project returns with estimates ranging between 37 percent and 79 percent. Project returns

  The discounted cashflow model is available in Excel spreadsheet format:

                                                   32
were found to not be very sensitive to input price increases, and the economic NPV increased only
by 12 percent when the price increased by 70 percent.

4. Because the project only fell 6 percent short of its original target number of productive
sub-projects there were almost no missed opportunities in increasing project returns.
Achieving the original goal by investing another BIF 1 million would only have increased the
economic NPV by BIF 3.5 billion to a total ERR of 60 percent. The estimated project return was
dependant on, but not very sensitive to, how quickly the build-up of sub-projects was from year 1
through 5.

5. Switching values were identified for each sub-project separately. The most sensitive variables
were: A 14 percent reduction in rice price leading to negative returns in the irrigated rice sub-
projects, and a 28 percent reduction in honey price reducing economic NPV of apiculture sub-
projects to zero.

6. The estimated financial and economic benefits understate the total benefits of the project
particularly in terms of environmental benefits from SLM investments, support to IDPs, some
multi-level capacity building, knowledge transferred outside the project area, and benefits realized
beyond the analyzed 20-year time frame.

7. In an attempt to illustrate some of the excluded benefits, a rough estimate of economic
NPV that includes the 622 forestry sub-projects covering 93,526 ha was calculated. The NPV
rose from BIF 43.7 million to BIF 72 billion by including BIF 19 billion from carbon
sequestration of 2.6 million tons of carbon over 20 years. This calculation excludes other
potential environmental benefits. It was not possible to obtain separate benefit and cost estimates
for the 9,866 ha that incorporated incremental anti-erosion and SLM measures due to data
constraints. This constraint applied also to the 10 demonstration watershed sites covering forestry
and anti erosion on 3,187 ha (1,774 forestry and 1,413 ha anti erosion). This reinforces the ICR
observation that the impact of the Project extends beyond what the results framework can tell.
Project Description
8. The development objective of the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land
Management Project (PRASAB) is to restore the productive capacity of rural areas through
investments in production and sustainable land management and through capacity building for
producer organizations and local communities. Beneficiaries also include war-distressed returnees
and internally displaced persons. The Project has three main components with a total final budget of
US$55 million, after additional financing in 2008 of US$15 million:

9. Component 1 (US$38.17 million): Support for production and sustainable land
management investments finances demand-driven subprojects and their effective planning and
implementation by producer organizations and local communities. It also provides emergency
support for returnees and internally displaced persons for their reintegration in the agricultural
sector. The component includes: Productive investments; Sustainable Land Management (SLM)
Investments; Support services; Emergency support for returnees and Internally Displaced Persons
(IDP).




                                              33
      10. Component 2 (US$10.92 million): Support for capacity building and institutional
      strengthening enhances the access to information and capacity of producer organizations, local
      communities and local project‘s implementing agencies.

      11. Component 3 (US$5.91 million): Support for project coordination and management finances
      project management and monitoring and evaluation.
      Methodology and Assumptions
      12. A 20-year discounted cash flow model of productive investments. As with the Project‘s
      original EFA, the current analysis did not attempt to quantify the financial or economic net benefits
      of the project as a whole. Instead, a 20-year discounted cash flow model was used to assess the
      economic and financial impact of the productive investments part of the project. This analysis
      therefore excludes Sustainable Land Management (SLM) investments and emergency support for
      returnees and internally displaced people. The financial and economic rates of return on investment
      (FRR and ERR) were calculated as well as the Net Present Value (NPV) of net benefit. 46 All results
      were based on net benefits relative to the without-project situation.

      13. Ten representative sub-project models. In line with the economic and financial analysis
      conducted for the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), annual benefits and costs of productive
      investments were calculated using representative sub-project models aggregated up to the project
      level. Table 3 lists the ten representative sub-project models that were included in this analysis. In
      reality, this covered 78 percent of the productive sub-projects and it excluded forestry projects.
      Note that, because of the demand-driven nature of the project, some of the sub-projects included in
      this analysis were not considered in the original PAD. Similarly, some of the sub-projects included
      in the original PAD were not represented frequently and were therefore excluded from the current
      analysis. In other words, the current analysis included sub-projects that were implemented rather
      than appraisal stage projections.

      14. Same model structure as in original PAD with updated assumptions. The model structure
      was maintained from the original economic and financial analysis conducted for the PAD in 2003
      although the choice of representative sub-projects was updated. 47 All price, cost, and quantity
      assumptions for the 10 sub-project models are listed in EFA Annex 1. The sub-project models
      included typical revenue and input cost items also taking into account wage and family labor. As
      indicated in the annex, when applicable, the investment costs include replacement costs within the
      20-year horizon in line with the item‘s expected lifetime. It is important to note that the current
      model does not have the capabilities of a standard farm-level model because the assumptions are
      tied to the set number of hectare or heads of livestock on each representative sub-project (see Table
      3). As such, a change in the size of a single sub-project must be reflected separately in each line-
      item in EFA Annex 1. For comparison, the assumptions used in the original PAD analysis are




46
     If a net profit is received already during the first year, NPV is used in place of the FRR and ERR.
47
  The original EFA model that formed the basis for the model used in the current analysis is contained in two Excel files:
“PRASAB-ANECO.xls? (dated Nov 11, 2003) and ―PRASAB-analyse economique - sousprojet_regroupement.xls‖ (dated
Oct 17, 2003). These Excel files include detailed line items and calculation results but do not contain any formulas
documenting how the calculations were performed. Time was spent reverse-engineering these files to replicate the results
presented in the original project PAD. Subsequently the reverse-engineered model structure was used in the current analysis
with updated assumptions for prices, costs, quantities, and numbers of projects.

     shown in EFA Annex 2 – although this only includes the sub-projects that are also included in the
     current analysis.

     15. Productive investment costs and other project costs. Using the assumptions in EFA Annex
     1to this EFA, the estimated productive investment costs in Year 1-5 for these 2,407 representative
     sub-projects amounted to BIF 12.8 billion (US$10.4 million). In addition to these investment costs,
     the analysis also incorporated a portion of other budgeted project costs, without which there would
     be no productive investments. Using the approach in the original PAD analysis, this included BIF
     11.6 billion (US$9.5 million) derived from: an additional 10 percent of productive investment costs
     to cover sub-project planning and implementation assistance; 50 percent of the budget for capacity
     building, research and extension, and support for agency investments; and 50 percent of the project
     administration budget. In total, the current analysis included US$20 million or 36 percent of the
     US$55 million project budget. It is therefore assumed that the remaining budgeted costs covered
     other sub-components as well as long-term benefits not incorporated in this current analysis.

     16. Gradual build-up of benefits. The analysis included a gradual uptake of sub-projects over the
     first 5 years based on the number of actual sub-projects financed over the years: 10 percent, 30
     percent, 15 percent, 10 percent, and 35 percent. 48 In addition, while most sub-projects incur



48
   According to the Government‘s project completion report the actual number of productive sub-projects financed in the
first years after 2005 were: 398 (11 percent), 1078 (29 percent), 618 (17 percent), 371 (10 percent), 1279 (34 percent for
2009-2011) to a total of 3744 (Republique du Burundi, 2011).
                                                             35
     investment/input costs and revenue from year 1, a one year delay was assumed in revenue from
     cattle and dairy production (see EFA Annex 1). In line with the original PAD analysis, it was also
     assumed that some yields would increase gradually and only be achieved fully after 2-3 years of
     production. This gradual build-up of yields and associated input costs was incorporated in sub-
     projects for seed potato production, irrigated rice, and apiculture.

     17. Inflation adjustment, discount rate, and exchange rate. For consistency, all prices and
     costs obtained in 2011 currency amounts. A discount rate of 12 percent was used to calculate net
     present value of the investment in accordance with typical Bank practice (as described, e.g., by
     Belli et al. 1998, p. 179), and for coherence with the original PAD. An exchange rate of 1,231 BIF
     per US$ was used.

     18. Economic analysis adjustments. The adjustments made for the economic analysis included
     removing the 18 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) that was introduced on imported goods from
     2009. 49 In addition and in line with the PAD, a conversion factor of 0.50 was used in the
     calculations to reflect the opportunity cost of unskilled labor.
     Results
     19. Table 4 shows that financial rates of return on individual sub-projects are much higher
     than the 12 percent discount rate and they range between 36 percent and 464 percent. Note
     that these estimates exclude project costs from components 2 and 3 which could not be allocated
     accurately to specific sub-projects. While not shown specifically in the table, these financial returns
     were lower than economic returns because of the removal of VAT on imported goods and a 0.5
     conversion factor for the opportunity cost of labor.

     20. Calculated sub-project returns were higher than in the original PAD analysis primarily
     due to higher revenue and costs together with some changes in sub-project designs. Table 4
     also shows that the sub-project returns on investment were found to be higher than what was
     projected in the original PAD analysis. In general, both revenue and cost estimates increased from
     the original PAD projections – with output prices increasing relatively more thereby leading to
     higher net returns. Assumptions are shown in EFA Annex 1 and EFA Annex 2. Other differences
     were found because the original goat herd analysis excluded net benefits from herd growth (i.e.,
     number of goats was maintained at 11 while the current analysis‘ herd projection stabilizes at 50
     female goats per sub-project after 5 years). A second example of the difference between the current
     and original analyses was that the original seed potato sub-project included additional investments
     including a second shed and a potato propagator unit per sub-project.50

     21. The calculated total economic NPV was BIF 43.7 billion (US$35.5 million) with an ERR
     of 58 percent (see Table 5). When other project costs were excluded, the ERR was 109 percent. As




49
   It was assumed that the following investment and input cost items were imported: Male Boer goats, feed/concentrates,
sprayers, improved seed/cuttings/plants, fertilizer, pesticides, lime, protective equipment, scales, furniture, modern bee
hives, beekeeping investment equipment, pumps, rice shelters, electricity, and equipment/spare parts. Details are shown in
Annex A.

    Note that, the FRRs compared in Table 4 were calculated on cashflow before financing - as is standard practice in project
assessment. The numbers in Table 4 were calculated using the original PAD EFA model and differ from those reported in
Table 1 of the original PAD as those were calculated on cashflow after financing.
                                                             36
noted before, the analysis covered 2,407 projects with year 1-5 investments of BIF 24.4 billion
(US$20 million).


22. Over half of the economic NPV was generated through sub-projects for cattle. Table 5
shows that most of the economic NPV was generated by the cattle herd, post harvest rice shelling,
and goat herd sub-projects (55 percent, 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively). The calculated
rates of return by sub-project were high because other project costs from components 2 (capacity
building) and 3 (project coordination and management) were not allocated to each sub-project
group.

23. A comparison to data from Rwanda showed no evidence that the project was inefficient
in its investment or input costs, although on the revenue side, obtained output prices were
generally lower than in Rwanda. It was of interest to explore if output prices, investment costs and
                                              37
     input costs realized in the project were inefficient relative to comparable alternatives. Data were
     obtained for comparable revenue, investment and input cost items in neighboring Rwanda. The
     Rwanda data included 41 unit prices/costs. 51 Table 6 shows that: output prices were generally
     higher in Rwanda and ranged between -10 percent and +80 percent of the current Burundi
     assumptions. Investment costs ranged between -60 percent and +100 percent and input costs ranged
     between -80 percent and +90 percent of the current Burundi assumptions. Overall, this shows no
     evidence that the project was inefficient in its investment or input costs. It is important to keep in
     mind that this analysis only compared a limited number of specific output and input prices. In
     addition, this analysis does not take into account that agricultural productivity is higher in Rwanda
     than in Burundi.

     24. The analysis indicated a strong sensitivity/potential for higher project returns if output
     prices were to increase. An 80 percent increase in all unit output prices could double the ERR
     to 113 percent. This points to strong potential returns to marketing investments such as those under
     PRODEMA. Table 7 shows the estimated ERR when all unit prices or unit costs were changed
     while keeping other assumptions fixed. This illustrated a general decrease or increase in unit
     prices/costs rather than a specific change in one item cost at a time. If one interprets the unit
     price/cost ranges identified in Table 6 as possible in the Burundi situation, the project ERR could
     vary between 50 percent and 113 percent due to changes in unit output prices. This indicates that
     there was potential for higher project returns if market constraints were removed and output prices
     were left to increase.

     25. The ERR was most sensitive to changes in unit output prices where a 50 percent
     reduction in all prices brought the project close to the 12 percent break-even point. In addition
     to the ranges ascertained from Table 6, the analysis included +/- 50 percent changes in unit
     prices/costs to illustrate that the ERR is most sensitive to changes in unit prices (revenue) such that
     a 50 percent reduction in all prices could bring the project close to break-even (16 percent
     compared to the assumed discount rate of 12 percent).




51
  The initial analysis included 77 unit prices and costs. However, 6 unit cost items were excluded as they were found to be
very different (difference exceeded 100 percent). It was assumed that these unit costs were not directly comparable thereby
skewing the analysis. The unit output prices included: rice, milk, calves, goats, cassava, banana, honey, rice bran, shelling.
Unit investment costs included: goats, heifers, sprayers, scales, irrigation, farm/troughs, shelter, hives, smoker, honey press.
Input unit costs included: labor seeds/plants, manure, fertilizer, chemicals, concentrates, transport, veterinary services, and
stud fees.

                                                              38
     26. Compared to reduced output prices, increased investment costs had less impact on
     project returns with estimates ranging between 37 percent and 79 percent. Table 7 also shows
     that changes in unit costs had much less impact on the ERR than changes in output prices. In
     general, the ERR ranged between 37 percent and 79 percent depending on how much the unit costs
     changed. In total the ERR remained significantly higher than the discount rate of 12 percent. This
     indicates that increased investment and input costs had relatively little impact on project returns.

     Note: Rather than changing the unit prices/costs by randomly chosen percentages, such as +/- 10 percent, the minimum
     and maximum ranges shown in Table 6 were used to guide this sensitivity analysis.

     27. Similarly to the situation in Rwanda, there is a potential that the price of manure could
     be driven up by an unmet higher demand for manure. However, project returns were found
     to be not very sensitive to increases in the price of manure, and the economic NPV increased
     only by 12 percent when the price increased by 70 percent. Monitoring of sub-projects that
     combine goats or cattle with crop production has indicated that there are substantial benefits from
     organic manure – both through sales revenue and from increased crop yields (see Republique du
     Burundi, 2010 and 2011). This has been reflected in the model through higher value per tonne of
     manure, increased manure available for sale, and increased crop yields compared to the without-
     project situation. The unit cost comparison with Rwanda showed a price of manure 70 percent over
     that in Burundi – primarily driven by high demand for manure from numerous development
     projects. However, further analysis showed that the economic NPV increased only by 12 percent
     when the price of manure went up by 70 percent, and the economic NPV increased by 18 percent
     when the manure price doubled.52 In other words, if an unmet demand for manure pushed up its
     price by 70 percent-100 percent, the project returns did not change significantly.

     28. Because the project only fell 6 percent short of its original target number of productive
     sub-projects there were almost no missed opportunities in increasing project returns.
     Achieving the original goal by investing another BIF 1 million would only have increased the
     economic NPV by BIF 3.5 billion to a total ERR of 60 percent. The Government‘s project
     completion report indicates that the project has funded 94 percent of the targeted 4,000 sub-projects
     (Republique du Burundi, 2011, Table 12). The current analysis was representative of 2,407 sub-
     projects. If the project had achieved its target of 2,572 sub-projects, and it is assumed that each of
     these sub-projects achieved an average return the same as the sample collected, then investment
     would have increased by BIF 964,000 and the economic NPV by BIF 3.5 billion. The overall
     project ERR could have increased from 58 percent to 60 percent.




52
   Calculations include economic NPV for sub-projects that produce or use organic manure. This excludes sub projects for
apiculture, irrigated rice and post harvest rice shelling.

29. The estimated project return was dependant on, but not very sensitive to, how quickly
the build-up of sub-projects was from year 1 through 5. A faster build-up of the number of sub-
projects extends the years with net benefits giving a higher NPV. Conversely, this lowers the ERR
due to the time-value of money of earlier investment costs. Figure 2 shows two alternative
scenarios to the current assumption. If the project could have initiated 80 percent of the sub-projects
by year 3 rather than 55 percent (faster build-up), the economic NPV could have increased by BIF
2.8 billion while the ERR could have fallen to 50 percent. A slower build-up of sub-projects to only
30 percent by year 3 could have reduced the NPV by BIF 3.1 billion with little effect on the ERR.
Note that, as shown in the figure, the actual build-up rate of sub-projects was very similar to that
projected in the original PAD.

30. Switching values were identified for each sub-project separately. The most sensitive
variables were: A 14 percent reduction in rice price leading to negative returns in the
irrigated rice sub-projects, and a 28 percent reduction in honey price reducing economic NPV
of apiculture sub-projects to zero. Switching values indicate how much a single unit price/cost
variable has to change to make economic NPV zero – while holding all other variables fixed. The
switching values were calculated separately for each sub-project model.53 Calculations indicated
that the economic NPV of irrigated rice sub-projects turned negative with a 14 percent reduction in
rice price. In apiculture sub-projects the economic NPV turned negative with a 28 percent reduction
in honey price. In several other sub-projects, the main switching values were output prices at
between -50 and -80 percent of the original assumptions.




53
   Theoretically, switching values could be calculated for the project as a whole; however this would suggest that the
positive net benefits of one sub-project should carry all other sub-projects. Unless one sub-project was implemented
much more frequently than others, total economic NPV would be very insensitive to changes in one sub-project
assumption. As an illustration, further analysis indicated that, due to the number of cattle sub-projects a 350 percent
increase in the price of heifers could lead to a negative overall project return.

                                                                           40
31. This sensitivity analysis has focused on calculating the effect on project returns from changes
in unit prices/costs. With the current model structure, there was an equivalent sensitivity to changes
in quantities: For example, a 10 percent decrease in the price of potatoes lead to a 21 percent
decrease in NPV, and the same was the case with a 10 percent decrease in potato yield. It is
important to note that the current model does not have the capabilities of a standard farm-level
model because the assumptions are tied to the set number of hectare or heads of livestock on each
representative sub-project (see Table 3). As such, a change in the size of a sub-project would have
to be reflected separately in each line-item in EFA Annex 1.

32. The estimated financial and economic benefits understate the total benefits of the project
particularly in terms of environmental benefits from SLM investments, support to IDP, some
multi-level capacity building, knowledge transferred outside the project area, and benefits
realized beyond the analyzed 20-year time frame. In particular, this analysis did not include
substantial environmental benefits expected from SLM investments including forestry and anti-
erosion measures. The analysis also did not include support for IDPs or multi-level training
activities of component 2 – except the proportion that was seen to contribute directly to productive
investments (see paragraph 15). The estimated benefits also did not include benefits generated by
the project-supported activities that could be transferred outside the project area through trained
farmers interacting with other communities. Benefits are also expected to extend beyond the 20
year time-frame included in this analysis.

33. A rough estimate of economic NPV from 622 forestry sub-projects covering 93,526 ha
was BIF 72 billion including BIF 19 billion from carbon sequestration of 2.6 million t carbon
over 20 years. This analysis has excluded all environmental benefits expected from SLM
investments of component 1 including forestry and anti-erosion measures. Due to the lack of
detailed data, only an illustration of its potential net economic NPV from carbon sequestration was
estimated for 622 sub-projects covering 28,744 ha of forestry and 64,782 ha of agro-forestry,
respectively. The following assumptions were used (see detailed assumptions in EFA Annex 2):
Productive revenue from sale of timber was only assumed on forestry areas. The benefit of 2.6
million t carbon sequestration over 20 years 54 was valued at US$20/t C and only as an economic
benefit because sub-projects received no direct compensation for this.55 Investment costs were BIF
5 billion and consisted of seedlings, nursery labor, and beneficiary contribution in the form of labor
for planting. An additional 25 percent of other project costs was included equal to BIF 5.7 billion to


54
  Using estimates in Falloon et al. (Table 5.1, 2009) it was assumed that land management practices converting areas to
woodland could lead to increased carbon sequestration of 0.5 t carbon/ha/year in the soil on forestry and agro-forestry
areas, and 2.5 t carbon/ha/year and 2.5/4 t carbon /ha/year in above-ground biomass on the forestry and agro-forestry
areas respectively. This amount of carbon sequestered on agro-forestry areas is 25 percent of the forestry area due to the
assumed ratio of plant density between the two areas (see EFA Annex 2).

55
   The social price of carbon emissions is conventionally calculated as the pollution tax required to keep Greenhouse
Gas (GHG) emissions at the socially optimal level. Expressed in terms of global warming, the optimal level of GHG
emissions is the level at which the incremental cost of GHG mitigation is equal to the value of averted damage due to
climate change attributable to GHG. The estimated range of economic or social prices in the Project Appraisal
Documents for the Rwanda Rural Sector Support Project 2 and the Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside
Irrigation Project was based on findings in Fankhauser (1995). This compares to financial prices such as those used in
Biocarbon Fund projects where activities that result in increased carbon sequestration are typically compensated at a
level of US$ 4-5/t C.

                                                         41
account for capacity building (component 2) and project management costs (component 3). Input
costs included maintenance costs in the initial years after planting and operating costs in years with
productive revenue. The calculation therefore excluded any sales and operating costs on agro-
forestry areas. It was also assumed that no other productive activities would have been conducted
on the converted land areas without the project (i.e., the net benefit of a counterfactual was assumed
to be zero). Total economic NPV was estimated at BIF 72 billion with 26 percent attributed to the
economic value of carbon sequestration (BIF 19 billion). The above estimate of net benefits from
carbon sequestration still underestimates the area of land that is expected to provide environmental
benefits. It was not possible to obtain separate benefit and cost estimates for 9,866 ha of the
productive investments in Table 3 that also included some anti-erosion and agro-forestry measures.
The same was the case for 10 demonstration watershed sites covering forestry and anti erosion on
3,187 ha (1,774 forestry and 1,413 ha anti erosion).

                        Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
                             REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
        Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land management Project

Three independent beneficiary surveys were undertaken throughout the life of the
PRASAB Project:
    1. 2007: The impact of the ‗agricultural kits‘ for returnees and internally displaced
       people was evaluated through a household survey covering 480 beneficiaries of
       the agricultural kits (and 120 control households);
    2. 2009: Upon recommendation from the MTR, in a follow-up analysis, the project
       impact was evaluated by surveying 162 producer organizations; and
    3. 2010: The project-end independent evaluation undertook a 260-household survey,
       covering more than7 percent of all sub-projects using a representative sample.

A common methodological feature of the evaluations is a mixed quantitative and
qualitative approach (including field interviews with beneficiaries and extensive reviews
of project documentation and reports). The main findings are as follows:

1. 2007 – Evaluation of the Agricultural Kits

The survey focuses on variables such as crop production, changes in farm output, the
number of meals per day, and seed supply which it uses as indicators to measure progress
towards reintegration. Other indicators include the number of returnees engaged in
productive agricultural activities, expansion of cultivated areas, and participation in
producer associations.

Key findings on the nature of the Project‘s intervention include:
    The production of beans was the most widely used kit, followed by maize;
    The average utilization rate for crops was low, at about 57 percent;56
    Fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and vegetables also recorded a low, but increasing,
       utilization rate from 37 percent in 2005 to 50 percent in 2006; and
    Seed quality was perceived as acceptable: Some 65 percent of beneficiaries felt
       that the quality of seeds was ‗good‘ or ‗very good‘.

The Project contributed significantly to agricultural rehabilitation, as evidenced by the
following findings:
     The land area allocated to beans and corn in project areas doubled since Project-
       start;


56
    As per the Government‘s ICR and ICR interviews, this rate was expected and factored into the PRASAB
volume of seed provided. That is, it is well known (from ICR interview with DPs) that beneficiaries will eat
at least a part of their seeds given the food security situation in Burundi. Several mitigating approaches are
therefore used by DPs, including PRASAB. Key among these is either (i) to partner with WFP who provide
food aid while the Project provides seeds as a part of the kit or (ii) PRASAB provides more than enough
seed to allow for some consumption.

                                                     53
        Over 75 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied with the composition of the
         agricultural kits;
        Most beneficiaries reported affording an average of two meals a day after Project
         intervention;
        Almost every household has a hoe in good condition, which provides opportunity
         for alternative employment (in public works, for example);
        Household seed production for beans exceeds 70 percent of needs; producing
         marketable surplus;
        Participation in associations often exceeds 10 percent; and
        Revenue generated from (seed) production surplus is reinvested in the farms.

Comparing the results of the project beneficiaries with control groups also shows a
doubling in cultivated land. Despite this, respondents perceive their production level
remaining flat. Control groups have similar, yet marginally lower food consumption
patterns. The main difference between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries is a lower re-
investments rate of (seed) production surplus.

2. 2009 – Evaluation of Producer Associations

The qualitative evaluation of the 2009 beneficiary survey of producer organizations about
project impacts finds that PRASAB, at the time of the evaluation, showed an overall
significant development impact. The key results include:

        improved household food security;57
        increased (self-reported) household incomes;58
        increased capacity of associations;
        increased capacity of maintaining the sustainable production levels through SLM
         measures.; and
        Significantly increased Government institutional capacity

Results from the survey are extremely detailed and go beyond the measurement of the
PRASAB‘s core PDO or IOs. Most of the indicators from the project‘s results framework
are captured and overall, are confirmed by those measured in the final 2010 impact
evaluation (see below).

3. 2010 – Final Beneficiary Survey

The beneficiary survey records overwhelmingly positive results. Most Project activities
had a strong positive impact in rural areas. The evaluation suggests that one should build
one these findings for future projects, as it is rare for Burundi that a development project



57
   The evaluations report that 74-100% of the associations whose members were interviewed perceive
better food security associated with the project.
58
   The evaluations report that 28-100% of the associations whose members were interviewed perceive
higher household incomes associated with the project.

                                                  54
can respond as quickly as PRASAB to the needs of the target population. Particular
achievements of the project flagged by the evaluators include:
    the effective combination of production, income diversification, and SLM;
    a close alignment of the project‘s activities with the National Agricultural
       Strategy and with the PRSP adopted in September 2006 (in effect at the time of
       the evaluation); and
    strong empowerment through CDD-type interventions of beneficiaries as well as
       for war-distressed victims was important.

Particular project achievements documented in the evaluation include:

   •       Support of 237,292 households (in 2010, prior to final project-end figures), or
           approximately 1.4 million people in Burundi;
   •       Promotion of social cohesion, female empowerment, and local capacity
           building;
   •       Promotion of agricultural diversification;
   •       High economic efficiency as demonstrated by internal rates of return (IRRs)
           of 165 percent for forestry, 74.3 percent for irrigation; 57.3 percent for
           vegetables crushing units; and 42.5 percent for forestry businesses;
   •       Considerable overall increase in milk production and animal welfare; and
   •       Environment protection, in particular through 71 million seedlings and the
           subsequent development of an agro-forestry business for some 1,000
           households.

Particular challenges of the project include:

   •       ―Confusion‖ and poor support by the public sector LIAs, which could be
           damaging in terms of sustainability of subprojects;
   •       Relatively high cost of benefits provided by the LDPs whose role is important
           and strategic, but could have had more results oriented performance rewards;
   •       Deficiencies in the number of service providers and training, in particular
           taking into consideration growing demand in the livestock sector;
   •       Targeting of beneficiaries (duplications are possible due to illiteracy); and
   •       Continued lack of forest inventory and management plans.

       Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land management Project

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The Borrower‘s ICR is a high-quality, evidence based document. It shows an above-
average level of introspection and produces a number of practical lessons. It is very
thorough in its component-by-component output reporting and includes evaluative
analysis on the challenges and successes of implementation. In sum the ICR reports that:

   •   PRASAB made significant achievements. This is despite the fact that not all sub-
       project applications for funding could be met due to higher than expected costs
       per SP. These higher costs stem primarily from an underestimation of the number
       of beneficiaries per applicant PO or CBO, which is in fact a positive development
       since evaluations show that community solidarity and social cohesion has been
       strengthened through PO/CBO SP application. Results in general come close to
       the original development objectives, and sometimes even exceed the objectives.
       The project‘s overall achievements are thus rated as satisfactory in Government
       ICR;
   •   More than 3,700 sub-projects were financed. The overall distribution of sub-
       projects is as follows: 37 percent for combined agriculture and livestock (mainly
       goats) activities, 30 percent for dairy cattle, 17 percent of the forestry sub-projects,
       7 percent for seed production, 7 percent for non-farm activities, and 2 percent for
       cash crops;
   •   About 145,000 households received the rehabilitation kit for at least two growing
       seasons (215,516 household received overall);
   •   The forestry sub-projects have produced more than 70 million seedlings and
       replants cover about 28,744 ha. Incremental SLM activities allowed reforesting
       of 1,774 ha with an additional 1,413 ha land area, now protected by anti-erosion
       measures;
   •   The restocking of livestock by the Project is amplified by genetic improvements
       of dairy cattle (imported mainly from Uganda). The livestock sub-projects had,
       overall, very positive results. Manure production also contributed significantly to
       improving the productivity of agricultural land. However, breeders have not yet
       acquired full control of the driving techniques of breeding in permanent housing
       and still need support in organizing the collection and marketing of milk;
   •   As part of the project 1,573 ha irrigated net area were rehabilitated in six
       provinces;
   •   Under the capacity building component, the project provided training on various
       topics (modern breeding, bee keeping, financial management, SLM) for
       technicians and managers of the public and private LIAs. The Project also
       supported the publication of the ―Messager agricole‖ newsletters produced in


                                             57
       French and Kirundi, as well as the production of radio programs to inform
       partners, the public, and the beneficiaries about the project‘s activities;
   •   The project equally contributed to improved capacity by providing logistical and
       office equipment, and by funding training and applied research activities at key
       Government ministries. Responsiveness of government institutions have
       significantly increased, with significant results in the development of strategic
       documents, sectoral policies, and the resumption of research activities;
   •   More than 246,000 participants have benefited from capacity building activities
       and 56 research technologies have been developed, of which about twenty are
       now in circulation;
   •   According to beneficiary surveys (see Annex 5) the project also made significant
       impacts by (i) improving food security and household welfare/incomes, (ii)
       capacity building of local producer associations, and (iii) maintaining the
       potential or agricultural production;
   •   The assessment of the beneficiaries is generally very positive, both from the
       implementation and benefits achievements point of view;
   •   These impacts have been achieved through improved productivity crops and
       livestock, sale of part of production, a higher production of manure and soil
       protection. The yields of some crops have almost doubled and milk production
       has increased six-fold;
   •   The share of marketable production is about 50 percent of total production. As a
       result, the project contributes significantly to the monetization of Burundi‘s rural
       society. Sales revenues are used to cover the financial needs of households (44
       percent), reinvested in the sub-projects (31 percent) or accumulated/saved in
       various forms (25 percent). The revenue of sub-projects in the production cycle is
       the main source of income for about 23 percent of the beneficiaries in the
       category of productive subprojects.

In addition, the PRASAB was involved in the mobilization of additional funding and
preparation of the proposed ‗Productivity and Development of Agricultural Markets‘
Project (PRODEMA) with became effective in December 2010.

Key lessons internalized by the Project in their own decision making and for future
operations cited in the Government ICR include:

   •   The participative CDD approach was the most appropriate in terms of raising
       capacity for productive investment among rural communities and their
       organizations, as well as in contributing to the social cohesion required in post-
       conflict Burundi;
   •   Attention to group formation and group coherence is an important factor in SP
       success;
   •   The need for ongoing training over and above the initial transfer of knowledge.
       This calls for more monitoring and mentoring on an ongoing basis for a much
       larger portion of the SP life;

                                           58
   •   It is important to recruit private sector LIAs with clear performance incentives;
   •    Marshland rehabilitation requires extensive planning and scheduling for works;
       and
   •   There is a need for stronger baseline than the Project had to accurately reflect the
       achievements.

In addition to those explicitly cited as lessons in the Government ICR, the following two
lessons also emerge from their auto-analysis of SP success and failure:

   •   The constraint imposed by limited quality planting and grandfathering materials
       (i.e., upstream sourcing);
   •   Marketing aspects require greater attention to maximize returns on SP
       investments (e.g., dairy).

- The analysis done to assess the achievement of the Project Development objectives, as
well as global environmental objectives; and
- The performance rating of the project and of its partners.

2. on the substance
Page 42: section5.2. (a) Government performance:
The rating "moderately satisfactory" was considered too severe. Some points mentioned
to disqualify a satisfactory rating are not recognized as weaknesses of the Government
support, including:

-The 100% financing of the project by IDA and GEF does not result from the
unwillingness of the Government to contribute to project financing. It was instead
an important outcome of the negotiations. Note that during the project preparation, the
Government had allocated matching funds to finance the PPF;

- Reference to the reluctance of the Government to maintain continuity in the

                                            59
management of PRODEMA should not be considered since it has not significantly
hindered the continuity of PRASAB‘s operation.

The representatives recommend upgrading the Government's rating to "satisfactory."

3. on the form
Page 6, line 5: 91% of the population lived in rural areas and not urban areas.

Page 16, last line: ... Capacity with planning orientations for 2004 was "negative." We
suggest "low" rather than "negative".

Page 25, last paragraph: ―very satisfactory "at start of the project and "moderately
satisfactory" in 2008" and not "moderately satisfactory at closure in 2008. ". In fact, the
project did not close in 2008 but in 2011.

Page 28 in the middle of the page: "Table 2 shows the levels of completion .... ".This is
"Table 3" instead of "Table 2".

Page 33, second bullet: In 2008, the project has funded the development of the National
Agricultural Strategy "SAN". SANs enabled participation in the CAADP, which in
turn allowed the development of the National Agricultural Investment Program
"PNIA" that PRASAB co-funded with all development partners.

4. Other recommendation
The Burundian government wishes to receive the document upon completion,
preferably in both English and French.

In addition to our email of January 20, please find below another editorial comment
regarding Cassava, Box #2 on document page 22.

"Tubers" are actually not planting material, but "cuttings". Cuttings are generated by
cutting cassava stems; tubers are harvested for consumption after cassava stems are cut.

European Union:

Sorry for the delay in replying: I was out of the office end of last week and wasn't able to
open the first document received.
Nevertheless, I do not have many comments on the report, and must admit I have not had
the time to read and analyse it in depth, although it seems to give a good and clear picture
of the results obtained.
It might be interesting however to add some information about the sustainability of the
actions implemented as well as about the coordination and harmonization of approaches
with other DPs.

                            REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
       Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land management Project


PDO and Key Indicators
1.      The PDO in the PAD is ―to restore the productive capacity of rural areas through
investments in production and sustainable land management and through capacity
building for producer organizations and local communities. Beneficiaries would also
include war-distressed returnees and internally displaced persons‖. This differs slightly
from the wording in the approved Development Grant Agreement (DGA) which is ―to
contribute to the Recipient‘s goal of restoring the productive capacity and livelihoods of
its rural population through economically and ecologically sustainable investments.‖
Restoring rural productive capacity is the core objective for both. Also, both read as if the
entire rural population/area forms part of the PDO. As discussed in the ICR, the wording
of indicators and the active collaboration and partition of Burundi‘s geographical rural
space among DPs throughout Project implementation indicate that the PDO should have
read ‗in project-affected areas‘ or similar. In assessing the Project‘s progress towards the
PDO, it is possible to identify the restoration of productive capacity (as per DGA) and
assess ecological (DGA)/SLM (PAD) aspects. The PAD wording includes beneficiaries
which are linked to the PDO through the Results Chain of Figure 1.

2.     It is not straightforward to identify the original Key Indicators for PRASAB, as
these differ in three different parts of the official Project documentation. First, from the
main text of the PAD, Key Indicators are listed as:
    i. number of subprojects and smallholder families benefiting from the productive
       investments;
   ii. number of startup kits distributed to distressed people (returning refugees and
       internally displaced persons) returning to agriculture;
 iii. percentage of producer organizations making profitable investments with the
       Project‘s help;
  iv.  increase in yields of major food crops from productivity improvements;
   v. number of hectares of rehabilitated land and agricultural land protected against
       degradation;
  vi.  proportion of requests for help with sustainable land management; and
 vii.  change in the use of wetlands in project areas from under production to not under
       production.

3.     Second, in the results framework (RF) of the PAD (Annex 3), the ―PDO Outcome
Indicators‖ are:
   i.  At least 75 percent of the benefitting POs and LCs continue to function for the
       benefit of their members and follow the norms of good environmental and
       sustainable land management; and
  ii. At least 80 percent of returning refugees and displaced families having received
       Project-financed kits have returned to normal agricultural life.


                                             64
4.      Third, while a number of related ‗outcomes‘ and ‗outputs‘ are stipulated in the
approved DGA, these differ again from both the ‗key indicators‘ and ‗PDO Outcome
Indicators‘ listed in the PAD (as above). The DGA indicators are instead drawn from the
Project‘s (intermediate) results indicators by component, spelt out in the PAD‘s RF.

5.      After an initial attempt to track the seven ―key indicators‖ found in the PAD text,
the Project teams (Bank and Government) quickly realized the intractability of these (see
also footnote 60). The ISRs retained the most measureable and relevant indicators on
returnees and SLM and added productivity measures and beneficiary revenue early on.
All others were dropped. With annual variations in the precise wording, these four could
be seen to be fairly consistently tracked as key indicators throughout the life of the
Project in the Bank ISRs (see Table 9).

6.      The 2008 additional financing package formalized these modifications, demoting
the SLM hectares to an intermediate indicator, although the Bank team continued to
report it as a key indicator until ISR-11 (see Table 9). The indicators approved in 2008
survived to Project-end reasonably intact, with the exception of dropping all coffee
specificity and some vegetables in the productivity list. Section F of the Datasheet spells
out the revised indicators approved in 2008. Once again, however, these differ slightly in
wording from the Project‘s Key Indicators listed in the 2008 legal agreement listed below.
Notably, indicator on budget allocation for agriculture is an IO in the approved
restructuring package and listed as a key outcome indicator in the legal agreement:

      i.   Productivity increase in the Project area of: (A) first grade coffee; (B) irrigated
           rice; (C) onions, tomatoes and cabbages; (D) cassava; (E) palm oil; and (F) milk;
     ii.   Increase in number of returnees and internally displaced persons reintegrated in
           their communities;
 iii.      Number of ha of watershed under sustainable land management practices
           rehabilitated; and
 iv.       Increase in budgetary allocations to the agricultural sector.

GEO and Key Indicators
7.      Appendix 159 of Annex 3 of the PAD states that : ―The GEF operational program
will address the causes of land degradation by accelerating locally driven sustainable land
management practices, contributing to maintenance of critical ecosystem functions and
structures (including maintaining agro-ecosystems, stabilizing sediment storage and
release in water bodies), and improving carbon sequestration through increase in
vegetation cover.‖ It is also only from this Appendix to the Annex 1 that ―Key Indicators‖
can be found for the GEO, although there are several SLM indicators in different parts of
the PAD, RF and DGA. The GEO ―key indicators‖ listed in the appendix to PAD Annex
3 are:

      i.   Preservation or restoration of the structure and functional integrity of ecosystems
           as measured by a set of applicable SLM indicators (including soil erosion,

           fragile lands and key biodiversity in representative sites);
     ii.   Institutional and human resource capacity is strengthened to improve sustainable
           land management planning and implementation;
 iii.      Policy and regulatory framework is strengthened to facilitate wider adoption of
           sustainable land management practices; and
 iv.       Greater awareness of SLM activities and issues among producers.

8.     These key indicators do not appear in the Project‘s RF, although they are
informed by SLM indicators in the RF (indicators on area (ha) of watersheds under SLM,
see below). Some of the results indicators in the original and revised results framework

   The Appendix to Annex 1 of the PAD is the Project Design Summary table required in Bank PADs prior
to 2004. The Project went to Board at the transition point between the old Project Design Summary and the
new Results Framework.

do also inform on institutional capacity and policy and regulatory framework for SLM
(see ICR Datasheet Section F).

9.      Second, the original DGA for the Project lists the following Project-end
‗Outcomes‘ for ―land degradation activities‖, but as the whole Project addresses SLM, it
is unclear that these are specifically intended as Key Indicators for the GEO. They are
listed here for completion, but do not figure in either the original or revised results
framework:
    i.  Erosion control measures are in place in mountainous land in the Project
        implementation area, and sustainable agricultural practices are in place in lower
        areas in at least 10 percent of farmland in the Western Escarpment Zone of the
        territory of the Recipient;
   ii. Pasture management and erosion control through reforestation have improved in
        at least 10 percent of pastureland in the Congo - Nile Divide Zone of the territory
        of the Recipient;
  iii. Agro-sylvan-pastoral production systems have been implemented in at least 10
        percent of cultivated land in the Central Plateau of the territory of the Recipient;
        and
  iv.   Improved vegetation cover (windbreaks) and water harvesting techniques have
        been introduced in at least 10 percent of the Depression Areas (East Zone) of the
        territory of the Recipient.

10.     Paradoxically, there are so many indicators cited in different parts of the Project
documentation that the task and quality control teams may have felt that the PDO and
GEO were well covered. 60 In actual fact, the more streamlined set were actually
monitored through to Project end, with some amplification on basic capital stock
replenishment, are ultimately sufficient and informative on the PDO.

  For example, the Key Indicators stated in the PAD text (see Annex 10) overlap (e.g. PAD Key Indicators
(v) and (vi) overlap without adding information); and one PAD Key Indicator is completely disconnected
from the stated activities and approach of the Project (PAD Key Indicator (vii) on transformation of
marshlands from production to protection). The PAD RF outcome indicators (Annex 3) are better and are
used to help with the assessment of outcomes.
