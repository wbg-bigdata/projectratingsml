URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND PILOT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Islamnic Republic of Mauritania
Supervisory Ministry Ministry of Interior, Directorate of Local Governments
(Direction des Collectivites Locales--DCL)
Executing Agency:    AMEXTIPE (Mauritanian Executing Agencyfor Public Works and
Employment/Agence Mauritanienne d 'Execution de Travaux Publics
pour I 'Emploi)
Credit Amount:      SDR9.7 million (US$14 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity
Cofinancing:        The Government and the Municipalities will finance an amount estimated
at US$6.4 million. Germany, Canada and France have expressed interest
in continuing with parallel financing.
Project Objectives
and Description:    The operation would have: (a) four development obiectives: (i) reduce
poverty by improving access to basic urban services; (ii) develop the local
private sector by increasing the competitiveness of construction and
consulting firns; (iii) support an initial pilot phase of decentralization so
that local governments can better plan and manage urban infrastructure
assets and services, and improve resource mobilization; and (iv) improve
public sector management by using transparent procedures and delegation
of project authority; and (b) three project objectives: (i) create new
temporary employment opportunities in rapidly growing urban and peni-
urban areas; (ii) help municipalities create or rehabilitate basic, urgent
infrastructure assets; and (iii) develop municipal capacity to manage these
assets and help MOI to play its tutorship role.
The project will have two components: (a) a program of poverty-
oriented, labor-intensive works sub-projects (US$20.5 million) in
participating cities, consisting of rehabilitation or construction of urban
facilities of various categories; and (b) capacity building (pilot
decentralization): (i) at the municipal level (US$2 million), to enhance
managerial capacities through the introduction of municipal management
tools including provision of equipment and training; and (ii) at the national

level (US$1.5 million), to strengthen the monitoring capacity of the MOI
and to prepare new municipal regulations.
Project Benefits
and Risks:           The program of labor-intensive public works (US$20.5 million) consists
of four categories of sub-projects: (i) economic sub-projects
(approximately US$6 million) which would have an economic rate of
return (ERR) of at least 12 percent and the net present value (NPV) is
expected to reach a minimum of US$1.2 million; average actual ERRs,
under the ongoing CCEP, have been 31 percent for roads, 42 percent for
protection against sand encroachment, 25 percent for drainage works, 17
percent for public buildings; (ii) social sub-projects (approximately US$8
million) for which ERR would not be calculated for each operation but
which would meet sectoral priority criteria for sectoral projects that have
an average ERR above 10 percent; (iii) revenue eaming projects
(approximately US$4 million), which would have a minimum financial
rate of return of 15 percent and an estimated NPV of US$0.8 million,
actual average financial rate of retum under CCEP was 33, and (iv)
municipal management sub-projects (approximately US$2 million) which
would bring additional fiscal revenue over the next three years of 200
percent of the investment costs and have an estimated cumulated NPV of
US$3.8 million. These amounts do not include other tangible and
important, but unmeasured benefits such as: (a) savings in travel time to
jobs, schools and health facilities; (b) training of unskilled labor; (c)
building the capacity of local consulting and construction enterprises; and
(d) improving operational efficiency of municipal govemments. The latter
would be monitored through the Municipal Contracts, annual performance
audits and municipal performance indicators. Over the longer term, the
institutional and policy reformns supported by the project are expected to
expand the decentralization program beyond the pilot phase by building
municipal management capacity and mobilizing local resources.
This is not a high-risk project. There are four minor risks intemal to the
proposed operation. First, on the resource mobilization side,
municipalities could fail to increase their revenue base and tax collection.
To mitigate this risk, a gradual approach to local resource mobilization
and a study on national/local revenue sharing will be implemented.
Second, on the counterpart funds side, the Govemment and participating
municipalities may not provide their contributions. To avoid this risk, the
project provides for up-front contributions before the signing of all civil
works contracts. Evidence from the ongoing CCEP indicates that strong
endorsement from municipalities will continue. Third, the program may
further skew regional inequities. To mitigate this risk, the eligibility
criteria for regional balance will be included and refined in the Regional
Development Fund. And fourth, on the institutional side, the DCL may
not play its expanded monitoring and mentoring role. To mitigate this
risk, additional institution support would be provided by bilateral
agencies, notably France and Germany. Exogenous risks include a

slowdown of the economy resulting in tighter fiscal controls or
backtracking on further decentralization. The impact of these two risks
was assessed and the conclusion was reached that it is very unlikely that
Government will backslide on economic management or on the
institutional and political gains already achieved in municipal elections
and decentralization.
Poverty:              Reducing poverty and unemployment are among Mauritania's and IDA's
priority goals. The 1994 poverty profile surveys conducted in Mauritania
stress that 57 percent of the population lives below the poverty threshold
(UM 32,000 or US$370 per capita per year) and that the poor have
limited access to basic services infrastructure (safe water, sanitation,
schools, health centers). The project, therefore, aims at improving access
of the poor to these basic services. The use of new management tools
(priority investment programs, performance indicators, eligibility criteria)
will help municipalities better identify the right priorities and target poor
areas by providing improved access to basic infrastructure and services,
such as safe water, sanitation, drainage, schools and clinics. Other
expected benefits are: a direct impact by creating about 45,000 man-
months of temporary employment and an indirect impact by creating
permanent jobs due to the shift from capital intensive to labor intensive
construction methods. Due to the simplicity of most works, 60 percent of
wages is likely to go to unskilled workers.

Annex 2a
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
DIRECTORATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
COMMUNICATION TO COUNCIL OF MINISTERS
SUBJECT: MUNICIPAL POLICY STATEIENT
INTRODUCTION
When restructuring began in 1984, the President of the Republic pledged to establish
democratic institutions in Mauritania.
This commitment was supported by all strata of the population. Accordingly, in 1986,
local government elections were organized at the regional level, and subsequently, in 1987 and
1988, at the departmental level and in the rural municipalities.
The intention behind this measure was, on the one hand, to provide all population
groups with experience of the democratic process through their exercise of the right to vote
and organization of electoral campaigns, and, on the other, to give substance to the democratic
option by demonstrating its importance as an element in the country's general development.
While this was the intention of the country's highest authorities, local structures and
local elected officials were not prepared technically for this transfer of power or its anticipated
contribution to sound local governance.
Difficulties of a physical, institutional, professional, and financial nature clearly have
to be overcome if the municipal councils are to function normally and regularly from the
outset.
Other constraints are ascribable mainly to the general environment. For instance, the
Directorate of Local Governments (DCL) and the administrative authorities, whose appointed
mission is to advise, monitor, and regulate, are not themselves sufficiently well equipped to
carry out these tasks. The situation is further complicated by a series of other problems, all of
which need not be enumerated here but which include the following examples:
*  The supervisory authority (DCL) lacking the physical, legal, technical, and human
resources to exercise effective supervision and to provide guidance and coordination;
*  Difficulties in putting laws and regulations into effect, a result of insufficient training
among elected officials in a sphere of activity new to them;
*  Municipalities without resident mayors and municipal councils who do not meet;
*  Conflicts of all types between administrative authorities and mayors;

Page 2 / 20
*  Municipal overstaffing, out of keeping with the possibilities and needs of the
municipalities;
*  Excessive debt obligations, and accumulated payroll arrears;
*  Lack of concrete achievements and services of value to local communities;
*  Absence of political, economic, social, and financial framework formulated for municipal
development;
*  Commitments not tailored to available financing;
*  A taxation system failing to accommodate the differences among municipalities;
*  Shortcomings in collection procedures.
In these circumstances, solutions are needed that will allow the municipal institution to
be protected and developed - an institution that is of primordial political importance among the
country's constitutional institutions in the election of the Senate and in the nomination, on the
basis of 50 signatures of municipal councilors, of candidates for the office of Head of State.
It is thus imperative to make every effort to orient action by the municipalities toward
integrated local development that will allow all dimensions of the problems facing them to be
addressed.
This is equivalent to saying that each recovery action must inevitably involve:
  rehabilitation of local government finances;
*  rational use and redeployment of the municipal work force;
D introduction of simple financial legislation;
-  commitment by the administrative authorities to better supervision of the municipalities;
-  improved management;
*  training for elected officials;
-  reorganization and reinforcement of the supervisory authority.
The objective of the municipal policy statement set out in the attached document
submitted for your approval is to generate solutions to the problems outlined above, which
hinder the advance of our municipalities.
This municipal policy statement is one of the components of a four-year urban
infrastructure development program covering the period 1996-1999, for which the World Bank
is to provide funding.

MUNICIPAL POLICY STATEMENT
The Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania began democratization through
administrative decentralization in 1986 with a view to promoting the exercise of democracy and
fostering local government through participatory methods conducive to good governance.
The Government is convinced that, in the current context, development goes hand in
hand with decentralized administration, especially given the advent of democracy in 1991. The
democracy and decentralization accomplished thus far have heightened the confidence of local
stakeholders and international donors, which will increase the chances of successful nationwide
decentralization.
The determination of the Government to introduce decentralization and make it a
permanent feature is behind the formulation of this municipal development policy statement,
which must in practice result in a transfer of functions to the municipal governments and an
improvement in their institutional and organizational environment. This policy statement also
aims at fostering the conditions that will enable the municipalities to increase their financial
capabilities and implement investment programs centered on the construction, rehabilitation
and upkeep of urban infrastructure.
Meeting future challenges in the realm of infrastructure' is not merely an exercise of
simple accounting - that is, preparing an inventory of existing infrastructure and calculating
necessary investment on the basis of past trends. Instead, all inefficiencies in both investment
and the supply of services must be tackled and user demands more efficiently addressed.
Efforts to increase infrastructure must be accompanied by an improvement in services.
It is in that spirit that the proposals contained in this document seek to ensure the necessary
legal and financial conditions. These will involve:
I.    Municipal assets:
* infrastructure management'
*  authority to contract
*  introduction of performance criteria for access to investment.
II.    Resource mobilization:
*  taxation
*  financing of local development
*  operation of institutions
*  municipal action.
I.    MUNICIPAL ASSETS
(a)   Infrastructure Management
l The term infrastructure in this context refers to the whole range of fixed assets (roads, municipal
facilities, property) envisaged by Article 2 of Ordonnance 289.87.



44
Mauriania Urban infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project. StaffAppraisal Report.
Annex 2
Page 4 / 20
Transfer of municipal assets to the local governments, as defined in Article 2 of
Ordonnance 87.289 of October 20, 1987 establishing the municipalities (communes), has in
many cases not taken place.
The Government will therefore do its utmost to promote implementation of the
provisions already been set forth in the basic legislation governing the decentralization of the
country.
That implementation could consist of action to:
-     Amend existing legislation by taking into account the particular nature of the type of
municipality. In this connection, a study could be undertaken to propose solutions geared to
specifically local circumstances;
-     Establish agreements between urban municipalities and supervisory authorities for
transfer of goods and services that by their nature are of local interest. In this connection,
clear measures governing municipal assets should be introduced as soon as possible so that
local governments are aware of exactly what means are at their disposal and the possibilities
for sound management of their resources;
-     Disseminate informational and educational texts, circulars and documents so that local
elected officials understand their areas of jurisdiction with a view to better management of
municipal assets and judicious utilization of the legal means at their disposal;
-     Hold training seminars and workshops on case studies, and encourage exchanges of
experience among elected officials.
(b)   Authority to Contract
In practical terms, real decentralization entails the authority to contract - in other
words, the legal and financial capacity to commit public funds.
This is in itself an area of expertise that is new to many elected municipal officials who
are inexperienced with it, especially because in the past local infrastructure loans have been
small, or non-existent. As the municipalities play the dual role of contracting authority and
operator, through the design of urban works and services and their execution on force account,
municipal teams have very divergent levels of familiarity with the specifics of project
management.
First of all, the decisionmaking role of municipalities in project management should be
reaffirmed, provided that the necessary funding is available, even if authority to contract, in
terms of technical tasks, can be largely delegated.
(c)   Introduction of Performance Criteria for Access to Investment
This new approach aims at rationalizing municipal action and management, given
present limited means and vast needs.

In this respect, the Government plans to give priority to inter-municipal infrastructure
projects with joint commune-based funding of capital costs.
Ways will also be sought of encouraging associations of municipalities in a given
region, for example to build socioeconomic infrastructure jointly for their common good.
Since the Government is aware that infrastructure performance depends on the
institutional environment, as well as on the general conditions for growth and economic
development, it also plans to take additional measures to consolidate municipal resources.
IL.    RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
Implementation of this policy requires reforms in taxation and municipal organization:
D taxation
 financing of local development
  operation of institutions
D  municipal action.
(a)    Taxation
Local taxation is inadequate and ad hoc, in terms of both the tax base and collection
system. The new policy will therefore seek to streamline the tax system overall and adapt it to
actual circumstances, with a view to maximizing revenue. The reforms should target both the
tax base and collection procedures.
Tax basg
Taxes and fees should be streamlined and collection performance improved.
Additionally, municipal taxes should be standardized.
Tax collection
Given its present poor performance record, revision of the municipal collection system
is critical. Regulations must be simplified, functions reshuffled, the exact fields of action of
the national and municipal tax authorities redefined, and incentives to optimize tax receipts
introduced.
Under the revised, simplified and standardized tax system, the central govermnent and
its decentralized offices should be responsible for the collection of all national and municipal
taxes, and the municipalities released from all tax collection functions.
This administrative specialization would have the advantage of increasing the coherence
of the tax system, improving the mobilization of management tools, encouraging better review
of disputes, and facilitating depersonalization of relations between tax officials and taxpayers.
It is also recommended that financial incentives be offered collection agents, and that other
incentives be offered to taxpayers to encourage them to meet their tax obligations by
themselves. For example, it might be made obligatory to show evidence of tax payment in

order to effect certain administrative transactions such as the sale of fixed assets, lease
agreements, and so on.
(b)    Local Development Fnancing
Ena
Municipal self-financing capabilities need to be strengthened.
To that end, the focus should be on certain actions, primarily productive commercial
activities, although without prejudice to vital investments in social and educational
infrastructure.
Cooeration
With regard to the mobilization of international resources, the bases for aid
coordination must be laid.
To that end, access to bilateral and multilateral aid should be enhanced. This can be
achieved if the Ministry of Planning and the Decentralized Cooperation Office of the Ministry
of the Interior provide information on progress with projects under way and on sector studies
that have been carried out or are in preparation.
Remote communities without access to "stand-alone" cooperation assistance, owing to
their limited ability to identify and negotiate such aid, should receive special support.
(c)    Operation of Institutions
Local accounting systems suffer from overly complicated and unnecessary procedures
and are not sufficiently transparent.
Excessively formal, current municipal accounting systems involve too much red tape
and are not tailored to the reality of most municipalities. Consequently, they do not allow for
optimal expenditure structures and, more generally, impede management of the municipal
entity. Budget and administration simplification is therefore needed, especially for the rural
municipalities.
Personnel
Issues of employment and status of municipal personnel must be discussed as part of
the larger picture of municipal functions and capabilities, especially since the 'auxiliary
employees' category has been eliminated by the new  civil service legislation.   The
organization chart should be adapted to the activity and means of the municipality.

Monitoring
Ex post checks and controls on municipal public expenditure should be strengthened so
that budgetary accountability can be established where necessary and persons who
misappropriate funds can be penalized. Ex ante checks and controls should be limited as far as
possible to matters of form (compliance with rules).
(d)   Mzuucpal Action
Since municipal action is the very lifeblood of decentralization, it needs to be the focus
of strategic planning that incorporates central government policy on the various aspects of the
economy and on regional development. The linking of national and municipal programs
should be institutionalized and planned at both the regional and national levels.
The Economic SDhere
A sector policy is needed which is consistent with the Government's economic policies.
Sectors with a direct impact on daily life should be revitalized - in particular
telecommunications, urban development, housing, tourism, and employment. Ibis will require
the formulation of program plans and the launching of projects that create employment
opportunities.
Data Processing and Storage
These policies will be dependent for success on the generation and processing of
municipal data leading to creation of a data base that facilitates analysis of the economic impact
of proposed municipal actions.
As the vehicle that will allow the components of its municipal policy to be brought to
fruition, the ambitious municipal development program envisaged by the Government will
require major financial and technical resources.
This sector policy statement is one of the current necessary steps toward formulation
and execution of a clear and committed national policy, as well as toward mobilization of the
financial and technical resources available in a context of international cooperation in
consultation with our development partners.
Thus, approval of this statement will signal the Government's political will to strive
with greater determination for municipal development, decentralization as an accomplished
fact, and democracy as a pervasive element in national life.

Note d'Orientation
Questions I etudier pour la prochaine etape de la decentralisation en Mauritanie
1. Objectifs
Accrottre l'efficacite des services aux populations locales en donnant I celles-ci un role dans la
prise des decisions qui les concernent et en creant un cadre incitatif pour les communes et le
gouvernement central par:
* l'acces aux ressources en fonction des responsabilites
* une rdpartition adequate des competences entre les communes et de l'Etat afin
d'encourager une prestation efficace des services qui reponde aux preferences de la
population locale, en ce qui concerne les services a benefices localises (tels que la
collecte des ordures), et qui soit coherente avec la politique nationale en ce qui
concerne les services I benefices nationaux (tel que l'education primaire)
I. Ressponsabilites des Conununes
Dresser une liste des differentes categories de communes pour etablir une liste realiste des
competences qu'elles peuvent assumer
Distinguer, dans la liste des competences devolues aux communes, celles qui apportent des
benefices au niveau national et meritent, en principe, un support du gouvernement central, afin
de garantir une qualite de service de base de celles dont les benefices sont locaux et qui
devraient etre financees, en principe, par les ressources mobilisees au niveau local (taxes ou
cotts d'usagers),  et pour un certain niveau de service repondant aux preferences de la
commune
Identifier pour chaque fonction le principal responsable de facto de la fourniture du service
(actuellement c'est rarement la commune) et preciser ses relations avec la commune
Exemple: La Sonelec- evolution possible vers des contrats de concession ou d'affermage avec
les communes. Revision de la tutelle et du contrat plan ?
Revoir les relations entre les communes et les ministeres centraux  (Education et Sante,
Equipements, Agriculture, etc)
*  en matiere de decisions concernant les communes (investissements et autres) ou la
gestion des services dont les communes sont responsables, afin d'aboutir I une
definition appropriee du rOle des communes;
*  dans la repartition des competences entre la commune et le ministere de tutelle afin
d'encourager l'efficacite dans la prestation des services par les communes , ceci
impose d'edaircir les responsabilites en matiere d'entretien

*  pour assurer des capacites techniques de gestion des services locaux coherentes avec
les responsabilitds devolues, sans toutefois gonfler le nombre des employes locaux ni
les charges fixes a la charge des communes
* en vue d'inciter le secteur prive I participer au financement et I la gestion des services
locaux
m.   Transferts financiers de l'Etat aux Communes
Etudier les systemes de redistribution des revenus du gouvernement central aux communes:
* fonds d'investissement, y inclus l'assistance des bailleurs de fonds, en vue des objectifs
suivants:
- encourager l'allocation rationnelle des investissements basee sur la demande et la
volonte de payer de beneficiaires locaux et une gestion de services plus efficace,
specialement en matiere d'entretien;
- assurer les services de base et d'importance nationale sur tout dans le territoire;
lorsque la commune rend des services d'interet national, etablir les procedures
d'allocation de fonds aux communes pour garantir ces services et fixer des conditions
d'acces k ces fonds, y compris des criteres de performance: efficacite, entretien etc.
* autres transferts : Identifier les formules qui les guideraient (de preference limites
puisque les services de base pour les populations pauvres seraient deja finances par les
modalites citees ci-dessus)aux municipalites si des soucis d'equite regionale le justifient
Dans les deux cas identifies ci-dessus, 61aborer les regles de financement des investissements
IV.   Revenus
Taxes et bpOts au niveau central et communal
Identifier les possibilites de rationaliser les doubles taxes (ex. taxes foncieres centrales et
municipales, taxe de debarquement des marchandises dans le port de Nouakchott, taxe sur le
poisson d6barqu6 I Nouadhibou), classer, dans la mesure du possible, les taxes en deux
cat6gories: celles a effet disperse au niveau national,(impot sur le revenu, TVA, taxes
douanibres, sur la pkche) et celles a effet local (taxe foncire , patente, taxes sur les marches)
et les allouer I un seul niveau d'autorit6 (communal ou central) pour 6viter la competition entre
differents niveaux d'autorites sur les memes assiettes de taxation.
Taxes communales
Chercher I rendre leur administration plus efficace-delegation au gouvernement central, ou
autres moyennant paiement pour services rendus (ceci etant ou non laisse au choix des
communes?)
Permettre plus de souplesse aux communes dans le choix de taux-(par Elimination graduelle de
la fourchette?)

Apporter une assistance technique I la place des taxes mieux structurees (adressage)
Redevances des usagers des services
Etudier les baremes de tarifs des services urbains et revoir les principes qui les determinent,

Etablir des indicateurs de performance des services I benefices localises (fournis par les
ministeres ou les entreprises publiques) afin de comparer l'efficacite des agences centrales I
celle des communes ou de leurs services concedes (etant donne que la capacite des communes
devrait evoluer dans l'avenir)
Revoir les procedures de tutelle et du contrat plan des entreprises publiques pour donner un
r6le aux communes dans la prise des decisions qui les concernent (investissements et gestions
des services locaux)

Annex 2c
Projet de Termes de reference pour la prochaine etape de la decentralisation en Mauritanie:
Processus paraUele de reforme fiscale, l6gale et r6glementaire en matiere de decentralisation.
1.    Anime par la volonte de democratiser et de promouvoir le developpement au niveau local,
le gouvemrnement Mauritanien a entamd en 1986 un programme de decentralisation. De nombreux
progres ont r6alis6s sur les plans legislatif et fiscal. Ainsi les communes, instituees par une
ordonnance de 1987, sont dotees de la personnalite morale et jouissent d'une certaine autonomie
financiere. Elles sont placees sous l'autorite d'un naire elu par le conseil municipal (lui-m&ne issu
du suffrage universel). La majorite des services urbains (voirie locale, alimentation en eau,
transports urbains.. .cf. tableau 1) releve desormais de leurs competences aussi bien pour la
construction que pour la gestion et l'entretien. 11 faut toutefois noter que la politique fonciere et la
police restent du ressort du Ministere de l'Intnrieur, des Postes et des T6lecommunications (MIPT),
chargd par ailleurs de la tutelle des communes. En matiere fiscale, la reforme de 1990 constitue une
premiere avancee. Elle a penmis de clarifier les taxes locales susceptibles d'ere percues par les
communes et de simplifier les imp6ts d'etat qui leur sont devolus.
2.    Lors des Journ6es sous la Khayma en juillet 1995, le gouvernement a confirmn  son desir
d'utiliser la d6centralisation et la rdfome institutionnelle qui en decoule au niveau du
gouvemement central et a celui des collectivites locales comme instrument majeur de
duveloppement du pays. La prochaine 6tape de ce processus est "la mise en place de methodes
participatives en faveur d'une bonne gestion des affaires des populations" (Declaration de politique
municipale du 14 juin 1995). L'objectif gouvememental est donc d6sormais d'accro^itre l'efficacite
des services publics rendus aux populations en donnant a ces derieres un role dans la prise des
d6cisions qui les concement, tout en garantissant le respect des strategies nationales 6tablies. Cette
volonte est soutenue par les demandes formulees par les maires des Communes de Maurtanie lors
de leur congres annuel (avril 1995): a) definition d'une typologie des communes, b) modemisation
de la fiscalite communale urbaine comme rurale, c) amelioration du Fonds Regional de
D6veloppement, d) transparence accrue, e) mise en oeuvre d'un programme de formation pour le
personnel communal et les 6lus, et f) restructuration de la Direction des Collectivites Locales
(DCL) au scin du MIPT. Cette volont6 politique partag6e de mener a bien la d6centralisation a
permis de cerner les questions qu'il faut maintenant aborder.
3.    Les problbnes actuels tiennent a la complexite du systeme fiscal, a l'absence de
clarification des roles respectifs des communes et des ministeres de tutelle, au manque de moyens
et de competence de nombreuses communes, et a la faible participation de la population. L'enjeu
majeur de cette etude est de definir les prochaines etapes du processus de decentralisation et
d'apporter un appui aux communes durant le transfert de responsabilites. L'etude se concentrera
sur deux elements intimement lies, qui sont les ressources fiscales et les responsabilites des
collectivites locales. Sans un systeme fiscal transparent, mcitant a de bonnes performances dans la
prestation de services locaux, et allouant des fonds adequats aux responsables de ces prestations, le
progres qui peut etre r6alis6 par la d6centralisation est tres limite. Un critere fondamental de
r6ussite sera l'elaboration de procedures permetant une veritable amelioration des services
communaux, particulierement pour les pauvres. Enfin, on veillera a garder a l'esprit les
particularit6s de la Mauritanie : a) une population (2,300,000 habitants) regroupee pour 30% a
Nouakchott (700,000 habitants) et, b) un d6s6quilibre interregional important des ressources des

Page 12 / 20
collectivites locales qui s'explique en partie par des activites economiques distinctes, mais aussi
par certaines mesures fiscales reconnues comme des expedients temporaires qu'il faudra revoir
dans le contexte de la decentralisation.
Objectifs de 1'6tude
4.     L'amelioration des services rendus aux usagers, souhaitee par le gouvernement et les elus
locaux, n6cessite I'amelioration des infrastructures urbaines, ainsi que celle des services
communaux. Pour &re efficace, le transfert des competences aux municipalites doit s'accompagner
de mesures d'incitation pour les communes comme pour le gouvemement central. Seront ainsi
envisages:
a) la clarification des responsabilites des communes non seulement de jure mais aussi de
facto;
b) I'allocation de ressources en rapport avec 1'etendue des responsabilites;
c) une repartition adequate des competences entre les communes et l'Etat afin, d'une part,
de delivrer des services locaux (par ex. Ia collecte de ordures) qui repondent aux besoins et
pr6ferences des administr6s et, d'autre part, de preserver la coherence des politiques sectorielles
nationales (par ex. dans le domaine de l'education prinaire).
5.     Face a ces questions, le gouvemement Mauritanien a demande a la Banque Mondiale de
continuer a l'assister dans la mise en oeuvre de sa politique de decentralisation. Le processus que
la Banque propose d'appuyer consiste a engager des experts ayant a) 1'experience des systemes
fiscaux, institutionnels, legaux et reglementaires en vigueur dans d'autres pays decentralises et b),
une bonne compr6hension du contexte mauritanien. Ces experts etudieront la reglementation et les
pratiques actuelies en Mauritanie et proposeront des reformes pour la prochaine etape de la
d alisaton. Ils souligneront les mesures a prendre et les resultats que l'on peut en attendre.
Les propositions de r6forme devraient etre accompagnees de scenarios de financement des services
et des repercussions fiscales pour le gouverenent central, comme pour les collectivites locales.
Les hypotheses sur la qualite et la couverture geographique des services qui sous-tendent ces
scenarios de financmnt devront etre specifi6es. Le but de l'etude n'est pas seulement de cldfinir,
dans un rapport final une liste de reformes a entreprendre. Elle consiste aussi a proposer au
gouvernement mauritanien des scenarios de reforme possibles; et a l'infomier des implications
6ventuelles des decisions a prendre en consultation avec les principaux interess6s. Ainsi une
collaboration etroite entre les experts et les comites form6s par le gouvemement pour etudier les
r6formes (le comite interministeriel de la decentralisation et le comite technique d'appui et de
coordination) est essentielle au succes du travail. Les etapes principales du processus envisag6 sont
d.crites en tableau 2.
6.     Cette etude necessite des experts dans les deux domaines principaux: relations
intergouvernementales (fiscales et institutionnelles) et institutions et fiscalite locales, r6unis en une
equipe unique. Une experience reussie au niveau intemational et la connaissance du contexte
mauritanien sont des crit&res essentiels de qualification.
I- Responsabilites des communes
7.     On note de grandes disparites entre les 208 communes. Les differences entre les
collectivit6s locales (qualification du personnel, montant des revenus locaux) aussi bien que les
exigences techniques et les conditions de gestion optimale de differents services sont

Annexe 2
Page 13 /20
imp6rativement a prendre en compte pour determiner les prochaines etapes de la decentralisation.
Elles conditionnent les competences que peuvent assumer de facon realiste les differentes
communes et les modalites de repartition des differents services. 11 est donc demande de dresser une
liste des differentes categories de communes dans cette optique. Cette analyse des communes
urbaines devra etre coordonnee avec les travaux en cours sur les communes rurales financ6s par les
projets "D6veloppement economique de la vallee" et "Gestion des ressources naturelles". A titre
d'exemple, le rapport Hoang (Cadre d'action pour le D6veloppement communal en Mauritanie,
1993) propose de regrouper les communes en trois categories: Nouakchott et Nouadhibou, les 43
autres municipalites urbaines et les 143 communes rurales. Les capacites des differentes
communes pouvant evoluer avec le temps, il est essentiel de definir egalement un processus et des
criteres de reclassement qui faciliteront les ajustements necessaires.
8.     Les comnptences devolues aux communes ont e  definies par une ordonnance de 1987 (cf.
tableau 1). L'objectif du gouvernement est de permettre aux administr6s d'exprimer leurs
preferences pour les services dont les b6n6fices sont percus au niveau communal; ces services
devraient desormais, en principe, etre finances au niveau local. Cependant, certains services ont
une portee nationale et meritent donc, un support gouvernemental afin de garantir une qualite de
prestation minimale dans toutes les communes. II faut donc distinguer parmi les services
communaux ceux dont les benefices sont locaux de ceux dont les benefices sont nationaux et
pr6parer pour chacun un cadre institutionnel, reglementaire et fiscal approprie.
9.     Les communes sont encore rarement responsables dans les faits de la prestation des
services. Afin que le transfert des competences vers les collectivites locales soit effectif, il faut
commencer par determiner avec precision les intervenants actuels. II faut donc identifier pour
chaque competence devolue aux communes le principal responsable de facto de la foumiture du
service et etablir avec precision ses relations avec la commune. Meme lorsque certaines categories
de collectivit6s locales ne pourront pas prendre en charge l'entiere responsabilite de la prestation de
services, par exemple, faute de capacite technique, elles pourront neanmoins peser davantage
qu'actuellement dans la prise des decisions de portee locale. L'objectif majeur est de permettre aux
communes de jouer un r8le plus important dans l'etablissement de leurs priorites. Par exemple,
dans le cas de la fourniture d'eau potable, une evolution vers des contrats de concession ou
d'affermage avec les communes et la r6vision du regime de tutelie et du contrat plan de la Sonelec
meritent d'etre 6tudiees. Cela permettrait aux collectivites de participer activement aux choix qui
les concernent, dans la logique du processus de decentralisation envisage.
10.   L'interaction entre le champ de competences des communes et celui des ministeres
centraux n6cessite une clarification des r8les. Les relations entre les collectivites locales et les
ministees doivent &re analys6es et revues (non seulement la DCL au sein du Ministere de
l'Int6rieur, des Postes et des T6l6communications, responsable de la tutelle des collectivit6s locales,
mais aussi les differents ministeres responsables de services importants au niveau local: Education
et Sante, Equipement, Agriculture, Hydraulique...). Quatre perspectives sont a prendre en
considera*ion:
a) les prises de decision en matiere d'investissements pour les communes et de gestion des
services dont celles-ci sont responsables. L'objectif est de parvenir A une definition appropriee et
r6aliste du r6le des communes qui prenne en compte la typologie des communes, la qualification
technique necessaire a la prise de certaines decisions, le respect des politiques nationales mais aussi
le r8le critique des preferences locales dans de nombreux domaines.
b) la recherche de l'efficacite et de la qualit de la prestation des services par les
communes. L'entretien des infrastructures et equipements communaux est un instrument majeurs.

Annexe 2
Page 14 / 20
Les responsabilites sont donc imperativement a clarifier dans ce domaine. II est 6galemeat essentiel
de dresser une liste d'indicateurs locaux pour les services principaux afin que population et
gouverneinent puissent suivre les progres realises. (cf. para 24)
c) la qualification technique du personnel communal. En fonction de la liste des
responsabilites attribuees aux les communes etablie ci-dessus (cf. para 8 et 10.a), les competences
techniques necessaires devront etre precisees. Ceci est essentiel pour la classement des communes
et l'allocation des responsabilites a ces dernieres. Neanmoins cette liste de competences ne doit etre
dressee ni utilisee de maniere aveugle et rigide. n faut encourager autant que possible les
collectivites locales a choisir des m*thodes imovatrices pour assurer les services. Par exemple, les
collectivites peuvent avoir recours au secteur prive, aux adminiatons centrales ou aux autres
collectivit6s centrales pour utiliser contractuelUement les capacit6s techniques necessaires, par le
biais de la delegation de maltrise d'ouvrage. Cette flexibilite et la competition explicite ou implicite
qui s'ensuit dans la prestation des certains services constituent des avantages qui decoulent de la
decentralisation. D'autre part, il est tres important que la definition de comp6tences techniques
n6cessaires aux communes no conduise pas A l'alourdissement des charges fiscales qui d6riverait
du recrutement de fonctionnaires locaux sous-employes et de frais de formation demesures. La liste
des competences devrait etre utilisee surtout pour classer les communes et les determiner fonctions
qu'elles doivent assumer. Elle ne devra pas pour autant forcer les communes A se doter eles-
m.mes de ces capacites techniques.
d) la participation du secteur prive au financement et a la gestion des services locaux. Les
r1glements, lois et montages institutionnels qui ont une portee dans ce domaine sont a revoir afin
d'6liminer les textes anachroniques, obstacles A l'implication du secteur priv6 dans la prestation
des services locaux. Dans le contexto mauritanien, il est important de souligner que le secteur prive
comprend non seulement des firmes et des entrepreneurs individuels, mais aussi des associations
locales, comme par exemple les associations de parents d'elevds.
Responsabilit6s des communes- Liste des tiches a effectuer
* (7) typologie des communes , processus et criteres de classement;
a  (8) classification des competences devolues aux communes (benefice local ou   national);
*  (9) identification des responsables defacto de la prestation des services;
*  (10)        1. definition des relations entre ministeres centraux et collectivit6s locales
(r6les de chacun, responsabilites, competences techniques).
2. modifications des reglements, lois, montages institutionnels afin de faciliter
la participation du secteur prive.
II- Transferts financiers de l'Etat aux communes
11. 11 faut revoir et organiser les transferts de fonds entre l'Etat et les collectivit6s locales.
Dans cette perspective, il faut etudier les systemes de redistribution des revenus du gouvemrnement
central aux communes sous les deux aspects suivants : d'une part, les taxes et impots et d'autre
part, le Fonds Regional de D6veloppement et les programmes d'investissenent soutenus par
l'assistance des bailleurs de fonds.
L'objectif est d'utiliser de faon optimale les ressources afin premierement de garantir une qualit6
de base aux services d'intdret national et en second lieu de soutenir les efforts locaux de prise en
charge, tout en incourageant la bonne gestion fiscale locale et centrale. On s'attachera ainsi:
a) a encourager le choix rationnel des investissements en fonction de la demande et de la
volonte de participation financiere des beneficiaires locaux, mais aussi en vue d'une gestion plus



55
Mauriania. Urban Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project. StaffAppraisal Report.
Annexe 2
Page 15 / 20
efficace des services (cf indicateurs para. 24), particulierement en matiere d'entretien et de gestion
financiere locale responsable;
b) a garantir les services de base et d'importance nationale sur l'ensemnble du territoire,
surtout pour les pauvres, de facon coherente avec la capacite de financement de ces services; et a
soutenir les communes qui assurent des services d'intert national (education, sante publique...)
selon l'attribution des responsabilites aux communes (cf paras 6-9). A cet effet, il faut 6tablir les
procedures pour allouer aux communes concernees les fonds necessaires a la delivrance de ces
services. On etablira des garde fous, dans les conditions d'acces a ces fonds, bases sur sur des
criteres de d'efficacite, d'entretien, et d'acces des populations pauvres aux services, entre autres.
12.    La grande disparite entre les communes pourrait cr6er des inegalites regionales; si tel etait
le cas, d'autres transferts pourraient ere justifi6s. II faut identifier a cette fin, les formules qui
guideraient ces derniers transferts. Toutefois, cela ne devrait pas devenir un moyen majeur de
financement des communes. En effet, tous les services de base pour les populations pauvres seront
normalement finances par les systemes de redistribution etablis ci-dessus (cf para 1 .b).
13.    Dans les deux cas de financement envisages ci-dessus (para. 11 et 12), on elaborera des
regles pour le financement des investissements. On etablira notanument des recomniandations en
mati6re d'allocation des ressources apportees par les bailleurs de fonds (qui constituent
actuellement l'essentiel des fonds d'investissement). Ces recommandations devront ere coh6rentes
avec les objectifs cites ci-dessus. Dans la mesure du possible ceci devrait inclure les fonds qui
passent directement par les administrations centrales. On etablira enfin les recommandations de
base relatives au financement des couts de fonctionnement et de l'entretien.
14.    Certaines politiques nationales de developpement (social et autres) necessitent actuellement
des subventions pour certains services. Cependant, la complexite des circuits et des procedures de
transferts des fonds masquent leurs effets. Les distorsions qui nuisent a la prestation generalisee et
efficace des services sont particulierement a eviter. En effet, elles se traduisent souvent par des
redevances pour les usagers des services de base bien en dessous des couits de ces services pour
certaines categories d'usagers. Dans un souci de transparence et de clarification des objectifs
gouvemementaux, on identifiera les subventions explicites et implicites au niveau national pour les
services locaux et on les rattachera, dans la mesure du possible, a des objectifs politiques. On
reverra les subventions existantes afin d'eliminer celles qui ne sont plus necessaires, puisque les
mesures envisagees pour la garantie des services des base (cf .para 11 et 12) ont souvent les m8mes
objectifs sociaux. Dans le cas de l'eau potable, la subvention de certaines categories d'usagers par
d'autres consommateurs est a etudier, surtout en vue des progres realis6s par la Sonelec dans la
commercialisation de ses operations. Le but est d'etablir des systemes pragmatiques mais plus
transparents, ajustes a la capacite financiere du gouvemement et qui introduiraient le minimum de
distorsions dans l'economie.

E11- Ressources aux niveaux central et communal
15.    La situation fiscale reste assez confuse malgr6 la reforme de 1990. Les problemes peuvent
etre classes selon deux types; le premier est relatif a la complexite du systeme, le second a la
faiblesse, voire l'absence de rendement. L'objectif est de poursuivre la rationalisation du systmne
des taxes au niveaux communal et national et d'augmenter les taux de recouvrement.
Dans une perspective de rationalisation
16.    Afin d'eviter les conflits d'int6ret entre les niveaux national et communal, on 6tudiera les
possibilites de rationaliser les taxes doubles (taxe de debarquement des marchandises dans le port
de Nouakchott, taxe sur le poisson debarque a Nouadhibou). On distinguera d'une part les taxes
affectant les ressources principalement nationales (TVA, taxes douanieres, taxation des industrie
de la peche et minieres) et propices a une redistribution ou a un partage eventuel entre les
communes, et d'autre part les taxes et charges destinees a couvrir les couits des services a benefices
localises (redevances des couts d'usagers, droits domaniaux) et on les allouera a l'autorit6
correspondante. Ceci est essentiel pour assurer une base nationale de recettes qui puisse appuyer
un systeme de decentralisation, tout en respectant les int6rets nationaux. La situation actuelle, selon
laquelle, pour maintes raisons, certaines municipalites ont des droits de taxation des ressources
nationales, cree des distorsions peu desirables et affecte n6gativement la capacite financiere du
gouvernement.
17.    La collecte des ressources est pour l'instant relativement inefficace en raison d'un manque
certain d'organisation et de coordination entre les collectivites locales et les ministeres centraux. 11
faut 6tablir une methode d'organisation des recensements en identifiant les besoins en mat6riel, les
proc6dures n6cessaires a l'adressage, les relations avec la Direction Generale des Impots, et les
modalit6s de transfert et de traitement des informations. On veillera particulierement a proposer
une methode adaptee a certaines particularit6s mauritaniennes (population de 2,300,000 habitants
et isolement de certaines communes, notamment au nord).
18.    Afin de favoriser la participation des administres et d'impliquer le conseil municipal dans
le processus de collecte des ressources, il semble imperatif de tenir compte des differences entre les
conununes et d'introduire plus de souplesse pour repondre aux choix locaux. On 6tablira la liste
des taxes qui pourraient &re assez librement determinees par les communes (choix des taux et des
assiettes). On veillera a proposer des garde-fous (indicateurs de performance, contr6les a
posteriori) afin d'6viter l'apparition de taux soit prohibitifs soit trop faibles, qui ne manqueraient
d'entrauner une baisse significative des recettes.
19.    Une plus grande souplesse dans la fixation des taxes locales ne devrait pas encourager des
taxes excessivement perturbatrices. La liste des taxes locales admissibles devrait &re 6tudi6e en
vue de la modification ,voire de l'6limination des taxes locales a incidence globale, peu 6quitables,
couteuses et lourdes a administrer, et I 'introduction de taxes plus en accord avec les critares cites
ci-dessus. Bas6 sur l'experience de beaucoup d'autre pays, les taxes a benefice g6n6ral sont
souvent desirables. Une taxe fonciere structur6e et administree d'une faron appropriee au contexte
mauritanien est une option interessante a explorer. Mais actuellement l'assiette des taxes foncieres
est liniitee par l'etroitesse du cadastre et le faible pourcentage des terrains dotes d'un titre foncier.
Les consultants devraient examiner des alternatives au systeme formel actuel, tels que le permis
d'occuper et l'adressage, pour restructurer la gestion et l'assiette des taxes foncieres en vue d'en
augmenter le potentiel.

Dans une Rerspective de simplification
20.   Face a la complexite de la determination des assiettes pour certaines taxes, des procedures
et des imprimes, le personnel communal peu qualifi6 est souvent desarm6. On identifiera les
possibilites de simplifer et d'assouplir les taxes inoperantes aujourd'hui. Toutefois, on etablira la
liste des competences minimales requises pour un bonne perception des recettes fiscales
communales et on en evaluera le cofit selon le type de commune. On etudier les possibilites de
sous-traiter la perception au gouvernement central, ou autres, pour ameliorer le recouvrement des
taxes, et on decrira les mesures necessaires correspondantes. On comparera plusieurs alternatives;
on veillera notamment a ne pas transformer la decentralisation en une deconcentration. Le principe
devrait etre d'offrir aux communes le choix entre differentes options, tout en conservant leur
responsabilite finale pour la collecte des taxes locales.
Redevances des usagers des services
21.   Le montant de ces redevances (enlevement des ordures menageres, delivrance d'actes
civils) est fonction de l'ampleur des services rendus par les communes. II varie donc de facon
significative selon les types de communes. Afin de prendre en compte ces particularites
communales avec plus de flexibilite, on etudiera les baremes de tarifs des services comnunaux et
on reverra les principes qui les determinent afin de minimiser l'intervention du gouvernement
central et de la reglementation dans les redevances sur les services de proximite et a bWn6fice
purement localis6.

IV- Cadre incitatif pour les communes
22.    Le but a atteindre est la responsabilisation des communes vis a vis des populations qu'ellos
repr6sentent afin d'ameliorer la qualite et l'etendue des services qui leur sont proposes. Le facteur
mod6rateur est le fait que de nombreuses petites communes no peuvent se doter de toutes les
comp6tences necessaires sans augmenter de facon deraisonnable les couits fixes A leur charge. On
envisagera donc les points suivants dans ce but et en prenant en consideration ces differences entre
les communes.
23.   Afin de faciliter un collecte accrue des ressources par le conseil municipal, il est
fondamental d'associer la population locale au processus de d6centralisation. On 6tudiera les
procedures qui encourageront la participation des administr6s a la gestion financiere de la
commune et a la prise de decision en matiere d'allocation des ressources. On insistera
particulierement sur l'identification des informations que la commune devra regulierement

commniquer au public. n1 s'agit notamment des informations sur la gestion des budgets, du
patrimoine de la commune, les decisions concernant les investissements et les taxes locales.
24.   L'objectif est de parvenir a un transfert effectif de pouvoir aux communes et, si possible, a
un allegement du contr8le gouvernemental. La tutelle devrait se fonder de plus en plus sur le
contr6le ex post des r6sultats et des moyens employes plut6t que sur la contrainte des autorisations
prealabled. On etudiera les formalites et pratiques de la tutelle pour mettre en place ce processus de
facon prudente, selon les types de communes. Pour etre efficace, ce transfert de competences doit
etre accompagne d'une politique de soutien et de contr8le des communes par les ministeres
centraux. On etablira des indicateurs significatifs pour faciliter le contr6le de la performance des
prestations de services (etendue geographique, qualite, fiabilite et entretien en particulier) et de la
gestion financiere de la commune. On s'attachera a d6velopper le contr8le des resultats plutot que
celui des moyens utilises.
25.   La decentralisation s'accompagne d'une modification du r6le des ministeres centraux. Ces
derniers doivent a terme coordonner et soutenir les communes; ce changement devrait aller de pair
avec l'augmentation attendue des capacites des communes. Dans cette optique, il serait intressant
de suivre l'evolution des capacites et de comparer la qualite des services. Ainsi, on etablira des
indicateurs de performance pour les services dont les benefices sont localises et qui sont fournis a)
par les ministeres ou les entreprises publiques, b) par les communes elles-memes, et c) par le
secteur prive (concession, affermage...).
26.   Afin de clarifier en particulier les relations entre la Direction des Collectivites Locales et
les communes, on etablira des processus simples de communication. On etudiera de meme le r6le
de la Direction Generale des Imp8ts, et on proposera des procedures de cooperation afin de
coordonner l'effort de recensement au niveau national et de mettre en place un systeme fiable de
collecte des donn6es.
27.    Pour impliquer davantage les communes dans les decisions qui les concement en matiere
d'investissements et de gestion des services locaux, on reverra les procedure de tutelle et le contrat
plan des entreprises publiques. Sclon le type de communes, on etablira des possibilites de choix,
pour les communes, entre les entreprises publiques et le secteur prive.

Preparation d'un projet de loi relatif I la
Maitrise d'Ouvrage Publique en Mauritanie
Termes de rEfErence
Objet de I'6tude
L'activite deployee depuis 1993 par I'agence d'execution Amextipe a permis I divers maltres
d'ouvrage publics Mauritaniens de realiser des operations d'investissement en utilisant la
procede du mandat, ou maltrise d'ouvrage deleguee, et d'en apprecier 1'efficacit6. Le
Gouvernement envisage de g6neraliser cette possibilite, actuellement limitee a une agence
d'execution des travaux, de maniere I englober dans le champ d'application de la loi
l'ensemble des ouvrages publics, quelle que soit la personne morale qui en assure la realisation
ei quelles que soient les modalites de son intervention. Le gouvernement a donc decider de
commander une etude ayant pour objet l'elaboration d'un projet de loi relatif I la mattrise
d'ouvrage publique en Mauritanie.
La maltrise d'ouvrage deleguee est un mode d'execution des etudes, des travaux publics et de
gestion des services publics, par lequel un mattre d'ouvrage public confie par contrat I un
mandataire, le maitre d'ouvrage delegue, l'ex6cution de travaux ou la gestion d'un service.
Le maitre d'ouvrage ne se dessaisit pas de ses competences; il lui appartient de definir le
contenu des etudes, le programme des travaux ou la mission de gestion I confler au mattre
d'ouvrage delegue. II negocie la convention qui precise en particulier les modalites d'execution
et de financement de la mission. n1 en contr6le l'execution.
Le maitre d'ouvrage delegue est choisi en raison de ses competences et de son expertise
technique. II est tenu d'executer sa mission selon les modalites fixees par convention, et dans
les limites financibres fixees, et d'en rendre compte au maitre d'ouvrage.
Les avantages de la mattrise d'ouvrage deleguee sont principalement:
*  une  concentration  du  maltre  d'ouvrage  public  sur  ses  tiches  fondamentales
(programmation, definition des objectifs et des moyens, controle), et l'allegement correlatif
de ses taches de gestion;
* Ia souplesse de mise en oeuvre et la transparence des relations contractuelles (Oa convention
de mattrise d'ouvrage deleguee precise les obligations reciproques du maftre d'ouvrage et
du maitre d'ouvrage delegue);

* la rwcherche de la plus grande efficacite par le choix du maItre d'ouvrage delegue le plus
qualifie pour les tiches I accomplir, et par le caractere incitatif des dispositions I inclure
dans la convention;
* la garantie du contr6le public sur la realisation des etudes, 1'execution des travaux ou la
gestion du service, gr*ce aux comptes-rendus du maItre d'ouvrage delegue et les modalites
d'audit technique et financier qui peuvent fre instaurees a la demande du maItre d'ouvrage
pour exercer son controle;
Compte tenu des modifications que la pratique de la mattrise d'ouvrage deleguee induit dans
les modes de gestion des administrations, la mise en oeuvre d'une loi relative k la maItrise
d'ouvrage publique requiert la pleine adhesion des autorit6s qui auront I l'appliquer. C'est la
raison pourquoi il est n6cessaire qu'une concertation tres large soit organis6e I l'occasion de
I'Etude.
Consistance des prestations
Le consultant est charg6:
*  de collecter et analyser les textes en vigueur en Mauritanie, notamment la Constitution, la
r6glementation des march6s publics, les decrets portant organisation, attributions et
fonctionnement des Ministeres intervenant dans le champ de l'etude et, le cas echeant, les
tta regissant les etablissements publics;
3  de definir les principes devant regir la mattrise d'ouvrage publique et ses possibles
dlegations et d'engager une discussion large aupres des autorit6s interess&es en vue de la
redaction d'un avant-projet de loi;
*  de rddiger le projet de loi relatif I la ma2trise d'ouvrage publique sur la base des
informations recueillies et des principes retenus lors de la concertation .
Ce travail se deroulera en deux phases I l'issue desquelles le contractant remettra:
*  au titre de la premiere phase:
*  un rapport de synthese sur le ddroulement de la mission;
*  un avant-projet de loi sur la ma2trise d'ouvrage publique;
*  au titre de la deuxibme phase:
* un projet de loi relatif a la maItrise d'ouvrage publique, prenant en compte les observations
formulees par les autorites interessees sur la base de I'avant-projet et pendant la phase de
concertation generale,
* une note de commentaires de la loi (motifs, principes, justifications, etc...)
* une note succincte de recommandations portant sur les modifications et ameliorations
(notamment en termes d'efficacite et de rapidite des procedures) I apporter I la legislation
des marches publics afin d'integrer les impacts de la loi organisant la pratique de la
maItrise d'ouvrage d&deguee tout en satisfaisant aux regles fondamentales de transparence,
6quite et controle des procedures et de l'utilisation des fonds publics.

Mise en oeuvre
L'etude necessite la presence d'un juriste, specialiste du droit public (en principe Mauritanien),
et d'un expert en gestion publique, ayant une connaissance approfondie et une experience
pratique de l'utilisation du mandat dans les operations d'investissement et de gestion de
services publics.
Cette prestation represente l'equivalent de 2 hommes/mois, soit:
* 2x3 semaines pour la premiere phase incluant le sejour en Mauritanie et une premibre serie
de discussions (2x2 semaines) ainsi que la fourniture du rapport de synthese sur le
deroulement de la mission et l'avant-projet de loi relatif k la mattrise d'ouvrage publique
(2x1 semaine),
*  2xlsemaine pour la seconde phase de concertation gendrale afin de prendre en compte lea
orientations retenues par les autoritds int6ressees; et
*  enfin, 2x1 semaine pour la redaction du rapport definitif comportant le compte-rendu des

ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Criteria for the eligibility of sub-projects include economic, financial and technical justification
prepared in a summary sheet by the requesting municipality. Due to the small scale of sub-projects, a
simplified economic appraisal procedure has been set-up under the CCEP using computer software to
calculate the ERR. To ensure simplicity, consistency and transparency no shadow pricing was used.
A.     How to calculate the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) (excerpt from the
implementation manual): The ERR is calculated to quantify project benefits. ERR is defined as a rate of
return which negates Net Present Value (NPV), i.e.
NPV (ERR, f(l), f(2), ..., 1f(n)) =If (k)   -o  for n years of project life,
where f(k)     =      (Net Cash Flow)k
=      (Project Benefit)k - (Project Cost)k
=      [(Benefit with Project)k - (Benefit without Project)kJ
- [(Cost with Project)k - (Cost without Project)kJ
for any year k
Take the rehabilitation of a classroom as an example for calculating the ERR. The classroom is
deteriorated and is estimated to need full reconstruction in six years. The municipality has to determine
whether to rehabilitate it now or to rebuild it in six years. The construction of a new classroom is
estimated to cost 1,000,000 UM and the rehabilitation is estimated to cost 350,000 UM, and the
maintenance is estimated to cost 10,000 UM per year. Net Cash Flow for years 1 to 6 is estimated as fgl)
= -350,000, f(2) to f(5) =-10,000, and f(6) = -10,000-(-1,000,000) = 990,000, and ERR is (or 21%).
A sensitivity analysis with shadow pricing the wages of unskilled workers at 50% would lead to an ERR
of 22%
Under the proposed project shadow pricing the wages of unskilled workers at 50% will be used
and the implementation manual will be modified accordingly.
B.     Actual ERRs (under the CCEP).
The following proxy ERR ranges are actual, expost calculations from the ongoing portfolio
without shadow pricing the unskilled labor.
Economic sub-projects: both new investment and rehabilitation must have an economic rate of
return superior to 12% to be eligible for project funding. Actual ERR ranges are as follows:
*  Road enhancement or rehabilitation: 7 sub-projects with ERR ranges from 31% to 47% and an
average 38%. The main benefit is lower transport costs;
* Fixing of sand dunes: 2 sub-projects with ERRs of 42% and 51%. The main benefits are saving
on sand removing operations after sand storms and lower transport costs;
*  Storm drainag: 4 sub-projects with ERR from 25% to 32% and an average 30. The benefit is
the protection against flood damage to households and economic inrastructure;
*  Administrative buildings in new and poor areas of Nouakchott: 4 sub-projects with ERR ranges
from 17% to 25% and an average of 22o/o. The benefit is savings on rent;
* Rehabilitation public facilities such as classrooms, health centers and administrative buildings:
29 sub-projects with ERR ranges from .21%. to 119% with an average of 36%. The benefit is
saving total reconstruction some years later;

Page 2/3
Revenue-earnings projects: While none have been financed by IDA, Germany is financing 8 sub-
projects with ERR ranges from 19% to 47% and average of 33%. Under the proposed project the
minimum rate of financial return for the sub-project to be eligible will be 15% and management will
be contracted out to avoid increases of municipal staff. For example, under the CCEP, the
rehabilitation of the slaughterhouse of ALEG costs UM1.2 million and brings to the municipality an
annual additional income of UM468,000, which takes into account maintenance costs of UM25,000,
resulting in a NPV of UM1.5 million and an ERR of 29 percent;
Social projects: Construction of primary classrooms will be undertaken only in case of emergency
and upon special request from the Minister of education. Other social projects will follow sectoral
policies and procedures when they exist. Otherwise, the selection will be based on a low ratio
cost/number of beneficiaries.
Municipal management projects would have a fiscal justification such the rehabilitation of a tax
collection office with a rate of return of 61%. The benefit is enhanced tax collection. Other examples
are street and property numbering to facilitate tax collection and private business operations. Cost
per lot is US$3 compared to USS40 for full cadasters. The expected additional revenue over three
years would be more than twice the investment costs.
3.     Alternative options. Experience in Mauritania and Senegal has shown that lower prices (by 10-
15 percent) and equal or higher quality of works are achieved through the AGETIPE model. This is due
to increased competition between contractors and the rapid payment through contract management
procedures (Implementation Completion Report for the Senegal Publics and Employment Project and the
CCEP Mid-term review). The use of local consultants for design of works and for PIP inventories would
further develop local capacity at a lower cost that the hiring of staff in each city or extensively using of
expatriates.
4.     Beneficiary participation to financing. Beneficiary municipalities will have to pay upfront a part of the
cost of their sub-projects as shown in the table below. This has proved under the CCEP an efficient way to ensure
beneficiary ownership, strong commitment and rigorous selectivity.

5.     Operating Costs. The two following tables show the impact of additional operating costs and additional
revenues resulting from the implementation of the program of sub-projects. After project completion the annual
additional revenue (USS1,435,000) is higher than the annual additional operating costs (US$839,000).
