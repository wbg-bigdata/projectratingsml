MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR AN URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND PILOT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
I.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for SDR 9.7 million, the equivalent of
US$14.0 million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for
Urban Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Mauritania is a vast, sparsely populated Sahelian country
with few natural resources: mining in the North, fishing in the Atlantic (mainly based in
Nouadhibou harbor), and the bulk of agricultural production along the Senegal River. The
urbanization rate is very high, 7.3 percent per year in 1980-1992, compared to a total population
growth of 2.9 percent per year. When independence came in 1960, only 6 percent of Mauritanians
lived in towns, compared with over 60 percent today. Nouakchott, established three decades ago,
now has about 730,000 inhabitants (a third of the country's population of 2.3 million), Nouadhibou
has 80,000 inhabitants, and 43 smaller cities have together about 550,000 inhabitants. A growing
number of small firms and artisans provides a large part of formal and informal employment in
urban areas. However, these small firms and the urban poor have access to underdeveloped and
poorly managed urban infrastructure and services. To address urban issues, the Govenmment
embarked on a process of municipal capacity building in 1986. A 1994 study of decentralization
recommended a staged process and different schemes for the two main cities, the secondary cities,
and for the rural municipalities. In May 1995, the congress of Mayors recommended measures on
resources, management, and training for municipal staff and elected officials. In June 1995, the
Government adopted a municipal development policy statement (included in Annex 2b of the
SAR). Decentralization was also discussed at length during the Journees de reflexion held with
the Bank in July 1995. The initial political phase, during which municipalities were created and
councils elected, will be followed by a carefully phased and monitored transfer of authority and
resources to the municipalities.
3.    Project Rationale The project supports a municipal strategy in Mauritania which follows
the main lines of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of March 8, 1994: poverty reduction,
private sector development, and enhancement of economic management. First, the strategy aims to
generate urban employment through labor-intensive works and to rehabilitate or extend badly
needed basic services, particularly in fast growing peri-urban areas where the poor settle.
Secondly, it aims to further develop the local private sector in the construction industry and
continue to disengage the public sector in the design, contracting, and implementation of public
works. These two elements are currernly being supported by a successful AGETIPE-type
operation, the ongoing Construction Capacity and Employment Project (CCEP) which would be
extended beyond Nouakchott. Finally, the strategy aims to improve economic management within
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and, through a pilot decentralization phase, at the municipal
level. It also aims for more transparent revenue sharing between the national and local
governments, improved monitoring through the publication of performance indicators and



2
municipal audits, and enhanced management capacity of elected officials and municipal staff. The
proposed operation aims to incorporate the broad principles of the Bank's 1994 WDR,
"Infrastructure for Development" and the 1995 "Municipal Development Review."
4.    Project Objectives. In line with the municipal strategy, the operation would have (a) four
development objectives: (i) reduce poverty by improving access to basic urban services; (ii)
develop the local private sector by increasing the competitiveness of construction and consulting
firns; (iii) support an initial pilot phase of decentralization so that local governments can better
plan and manage urban infrastructure assets and services, and improve resource mobilization; and
(iv) improve public sector management by using transparent procedures and delegation of project
authority; and (b) three project objectives: (i) create new temporary employment opportunities in
rapidly growing urban and peri-urban areas; (ii) help municipalities create or rehabilitate basic,
urgent infrastructure assets; and (iii) develop municipal capacity to manage these assets and help
MOI to play its tutorship role.
5.    Project Description. The project will have two components: (a) a program of poverty-
oriented, labor-intensive works sub-projects (US$20.5 million) in participating cities, consisting of
rehabilitation or construction of urban facilities of various categories (schedule B 1, p. 1); and (b)
capacity building (pilot decentralization): (i) at the municipal level (US$2 million), to enhance
managerial capacities through the introduction of municipal management tools including provision
of equipment and training; and (ii) at the national level (US$1.5 million), to strengthen the
monitoring capacity of the MOI and to prepare new municipal regulations. The proposed project
will continue and extend to new cities the on-going process which gives beneficiary municipalities
full authority and financial obligation over the choice of investment operations, but this time with a
solid base of performance indicators and priority investment programs. The reform of municipal
responsibilities finances will be carried out step by step. First, the efficiency of municipal tax
collection will increase and the municipal resource distribution will improve within a stronger
institutional framework. Second, this reform will be complemented by investment operations (such
as street numbering) which will have a positive impact on tax collection. The pilot will start in
Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, focusing on municipal infrastructure management and tax collection
to implement new municipal management tools. After full review and assessment of the pilot
effectiveness, the tools will be implemented in a phased manner in other cities. Annual reviews,
annual municipal audits, and workshops with beneficiaries will provide feedback information and
help fine tune the reform process and the investment program.
6.    Project Implementation. MOI and participating municipalities would implement the
project and focus on planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Building upon the contracting
experience and transparent procurement procedures introduced under the ongoing CCEP project,
AMEXTIPE (Agence Mauritanienne d 'Execution de Travaux d 'Intir&t Public pour I 'Emploi)
would execute all labor-intensive works and studies selected by MOI or by municipalities. To
monitor progress in providing and maintaining urban services, the DCL (Direction des
Collectivites Locales) of the MOI would introduce new Municipal Contracts to include
performance indicators and annual performance audits. The municipalities would participate only
on a voluntary basis and would (a) prepare inventories of their assets and identify rehabilitation
and expansion priorities; (b) develop coherent, rolling Priority Investment Programs (PIPs) and
bear part of the investment costs up front; (c) carry-out performance audits, prepare and sign
Municipal Contracts with the DCL; and (d) publish audit reports. The Decentralization Technical



3
Coordination Committee (DTCC), comprised of representatives of the Ministries of Plan, Finance
and Interior and the Association of Mayors, would review draft regulations to be prepared under
the project, and present them to the Inter-ministerial Decentralization Committee for approval.
Preparation of draft regulations is to be started soon after project effectiveness, in September 1996,
and the first set of proposals are expected to be submitted to Parliament in November 1997.
7.    Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. The ongoing CCEP has been
efficiently implemented due to: (a) strong ownership of the proposed sub-projects, partly financed
by the beneficiaries; (b) effective contract management of the sub-projects by AMEXTIPE, which
enjoys autonomy and efficient business practices defined in a Manual of Procedures agreed upon
with the Government and IDA; (c) strong response from mainly local private consultants and
contractors; (d) very positive perception by the beneficiary population; and (e) stakeholder
participation on the Board of AMEXTIPE. Still, the CCEP did not address the need to develop
municipal capacity nor include the population in the selection of sub-projects, both of which are
proposed in the new operation.
8     Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project supports the main lines of the
CAS discussed on March 8, 1994 and aims to: (a) consolidate a home-grown, transparent and
efficient institutional model to implement priority labor intensive works in a rapidly urbanizing
context and support its expansion to secondary cities and towns; and (b) support a first pilot phase
of the Government's decentralization policy aimed at developing municipal capacity for better
managing and maintaining infrastructure assets and basic services.
9. Agreed Actions. Agreements were reached or confirmed at negotiations on: (a) the tax
and customs regime of the project; (b) the institutional set-up of the project; (c) the key
performance indicators; (d) the percentage of financial contribution of the beneficiaries; (e) the
eligibility criteria for sub-projects; (f) the government's responsibility and monitoring of
AMEXTIIPE's financial management; (g) the periodicity and terms of reference of fiscal, technical,
managerial, and environmental audits, and a short-list of potential auditing firms or joint-ventures;
(h) the scope for the annual reviews and the scope and date for the mid-term reviews; (i) the signing
of the Municipal Contracts and the setting up of a Priority Investment Program as eligibility
criteria for a Municipality (starting the second year except for Nouakchott); (j) draft Decree
creating the Inter-Ministerial Decentralization Committee and the Decentralization Technical
Coordination Committee; and (k) updated text of the agreement between the Govermment and
AMEXTIPE. Effectiveness of the Credit will be subject to the following conditions: (a) an
initial deposit of US$250, 000 in the project account would have been made by the Government;
(b) the updated General Agreement between GRIM and AMEXTIPE would have been signed; (c)
the portfolio of sub-projects for the first year would have been submitted to IDA; (d) the
Municipal Contract of Nouakchott would have been signed and the PIP of Nouakchott would
have been adopted; and (e) auditors acceptable to IDA, with terms of reference acceptable to
IDA, would have been appointed
10.   Poverty Category. Reducing poverty and unemployment are among Mauritania's and
IDA's priority goals. The 1994 poverty profile surveys conducted in Mauritania stress that
57 percent of the population lives below the poverty threshold (UM 32,000 or US$370 per capita
per year) and that the poor have limited access to basic services infrastructure (safe water and
sanitation, schools, health centers). The project therefore aims at improving access of the poor to



4
these basic services. The use of new management tools (PIPs, performance indicators, eligibility
criteria) will help municipalities better identify the right priorities and target poor areas by
providing improved access to basic infrastructure and services. The project will create about
45,000 man-months of temporary employment and have an indirect lasting impact by promoting
the use of labor intensive construction methods. Due to the simplicity of most works, 60 percent of
wages is likely to go to unskilled workers.
11.   Environmental Aspects. The project is category B. All sub-projects are very small scale
and will generally have a positive impact, if any, on the environment. Similar sub-projects carried
out under CCEP have had a positive impact on the environment by providing drainage,
rehabilitation, public spaces, waste collection, and protection against sand encroachment. The
recommendations of the CCEP mid-term review have been included into the revised AMEXTIPE's
Manual of Procedures. As a program operation, no ex-ante project environmenWal assessment can
be carried out, but an ex-ante warning is built-in as each sub-project is selected. Any
environmental impact will be described in the summary project sheet prepared by the
municipalities, which would seek guidance from the apex environmental body in Mauritania, when
necessary. An environmental impact assessment will be mandatory for all revenue earning
projects. The proposed mid-term review will also include a post-evaluation of the environmental
impact of sub-projects and formulate recommendations for the second half of the project.
12.   Program Objective Categories. The project relates to three of IDA's program objective
categories and the CAS for Mauritania. It will (a) help reduce poverty by facilitating access to
affordable urban services for the poor and creating employment opportunities through the use of
labor-based construction methods; (b) promote environmentally sustainable development through
rehabilitation and/or construction of urban facilities using appropriate design and construction
management procedures; and (c) enhance economic management by revising the distribution of
responsibilities between municipal and central government, improving the municipal tax system,
reinforcing municipal management practices, and promoting the use of transparent delegation of
project authority.
13.   Participatory Approach. Both the policy statement, which was adopted in May by the
Government, and the project were prepared by a temporary committee chaired by the DCL, with
representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Plan, MET, and Association of Mayors. At
appraisal, a workshop gathered all stakeholders (mayors, public services representatives, and
NGOs) to obtain their input in the final design of the project. To provide systematic feedback
during implementation, and before the PIPs and Municipal Contracts are adopted by the Municipal
Councils, stakeholders would be invited to participate in public meetings "under the tent" reflecting
the traditional consensus-building practice rooted in Mauritanian culture. To further disseminate
and promote transparency and accountability, the municipal audit reports, along with performance
indicators, would be published and made available to the population. In addition, beneficiary
surveys would be conducted for specific sub-projects. The results of these surveys would be
discussed at stakeholder workshops, which would be conducted as part of the annual and mid-term
reviews of the project between the Government and IDA. Furthermore, stakeholders are
represented on the Board of AMEXTIPE.

14.   Project benefits. The program of labor-intensive public works (US$20.5 million) consists
of four categories of sub-projects: (i) economic sub-projects (approximately US$6 million) which
are required to have an economic rate of return (ERR) of at least 12 percent and the net present
value (NPV) is expected to reach a minimum of US$1.2 million. Under the ongoing CCEP, simple
standardized procedures have been set up to calculate the ERR of each sub-project. No shadow
pricing was used to insure simplicity, consistency and transparency. Average actual ERRs have
been 31 percent for roads, 42 percent for protection against sand encroachment, 25 percent for
drainage works, 17 percent for public buildings; if we were using shadow pricing for the cost of
unskilled labor, for which unemployment is high, it would result into higher ERRs; (ii) social sub-
projects (approximately US$8 million) for which an ERR would not be calculated for each
operation; however, these sub-projects are required to meet sectoral priority criteria and standard
designs which have been established for projects at the national level with an average ERR above
10 percent; (iii) revenue eaning projects (approximately US$4 million), which are required to have
a minimum financial rate of return of 15 percent and an estimated NPV of US$0.8 million; actual
average financial rate of return under CCEP was 33; and (iv) municipal management sub-projects
(approximately US$2 million), which are required to bring additional fiscal revenue over the next
three years of 200 percent of the investment costs; these sub-projects would build up municipal
financial capacities; the estimated NPV is US$3.8 million. Schedule B1 gives more details on
actual rates observed under the CCEP.
15.   These amounts do not include other tangible and important, but unmeasured benefits such
as: (a) savings in travel time to jobs, schools and health facilities; (b) training of unskilled labor;
(c) building the capacity of local consulting and construction enterprises; and (d) improving
operational efficiency of municipal governments. The latter would be monitored through the
Municipal Contracts, annual performance audits and municipal performance indicators shown in
Schedule B2. Over the longer term, the institutional and policy reforms supported by the project
are expected to expand the decentralization program beyond the pilot phase by building municipal
management capacity and mobilizing local resources.
16.   Project Sustainability. Financial sustainability of municipal investments will be achieved
by (a) enhanced programming through the use of PIPs; (b) improved maintenance as required in the
Municipal Contracts; (c) increased and growing financial participation of beneficiary
municipalities; and (d) improved local resource mobilization for investments and their maintenance.
Additional municipal revenues starting Year 5 would amount to US$1,435,000 compared to
additional recurrent costs are US$839,000 on fairly conservative assumptions (see Schedule BI,
page 4). Sustainability of institutions will be strengthened by (a) the monitoring capacity and
mentoring of the DCL in MOI; (b) training and development of municipal staff and elected
officials; and (c) consolidating AMEXTIPE, a home-grown institutional model for implementing
public works contracts. In political terrns, sustainability will be improved through clearer and
more cooperative relations between MOI and municipalities. Nevertheless, there are some
uncertainties which can effect long-term sustainability. Among these are the Government's long-
term commitment to decentralization as a long-term process and to the election of municipal
councils. In addition, the Government's continued respect for the autonomy and the commercial
orientation of AMEXTIPE would be needed. A change in Govemment policy could undermine
gains made in municipal govemance and in the transparency of procurement procedures.



6
17.   Risks. This is not a high-risk project. There are four minor risks internal to the proposed
operation. First, on the resource mobilization side, municipalities could fail to increase their
revenue base and tax collection. To mitigate this risk, a gradual approach to local resource
mobilization and a study on national/local revenue sharing will be implemented. Second, on the
counterpart funds side, the Government and participating municipalities may not provide their
contributions. To avoid this risk, the project provides for up-front contributions before the signing
of all civil works contracts. Evidence from the ongoing CCEP indicates that strong endorsement
from municipalities will continue. Third, the program may further skew regional inequities. To
mitigate this risk, the eligibility criteria for regional balance will be included and refined in the
Regional Development Fund. And fourth, on the institutional side, the DCL may fail to play its
expanded monitoring and mentoring role. To mitigate this risk, additional institutional support
would be provided by bilateral agencies from other countries, notably France and Germany.
Exogenous risks include a slowdown of the economy resulting in tighter fiscal controls or
backtracking on further decentralization. The impact of these two risks was assessed and the
conclusion was reached that it is very unlikely that Government will backslide on economic
management or on the institutional and political gains already achieved in municipal elections and
decentralization.
18.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

The Government is seeking for parallel financing from Germany, Canada and France who have
expressed interest; commitment could not be made due to lending calendar constraints relative to
each donor. Would the parallel financing not materialize, the project would be downsized and
completed earlier. However, this is unlikely. When the CCEP was appraised, parallel financing by
other donors was similarly forecast for US$4 million. Actually, three years after project
effectiveness, Germany has provided DTM5 million and Canada C$3 million, or in total, US$5.7
million.

URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND PILOT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Criteria for the eligibility of sub-projects include economic, financial and technical justification
prepared in a summary sheet by the requesting municipality. Due to the small scale of sub-projects, a
simplified economic appraisal procedure has been set-up under the CCEP using computer software to
calculate the ERR. To ensure simplicity, consistency and transparency no shadow pricing was used.
A.     How to calculate the Economic Rates of Return (ERR) (excerpt from the implementation
manual). Take the rehabilitation of a classroom as an example for calculating the ERR. The classroom is
deteriorated and is estimated to need full reconstruction in six years. The municipality has to determine
whether to rehabilitate it now or to rebuild it in six years. The construction of a new classroom is
estimated to cost 1,000,000 UM and the rehabilitation is estimated to cost 350,000 UM, and the
maintenance is estimated to cost 10,000 UM per year. Net Cash Flow for years I to 6 is estimated as
f(1) = -350,000, f(2) to f(5) =-10,000, and f(6) = -10,000-(-1,000,000) = 990,000, and ERR is
-350,000   - 10,000   - 10,000   - 10,000   - 10,000   990,000   0
+          +                                  _     ____~+   
(I+i)     (I+i)2     (I+i)3    (I+i)4    (I+i)5    (I  i)6
Solving for i, we get 0.21 (or 21 percent) as ERR. A sensitivity analysis with shadow pricing the wages of
unskilled workers at 50 percent leads to an ERR of 22 percent.
Under the proposed project, shadow pricing of the wages of unskilled workers at 50 percent will be used
and the implementation manual will be modified accordingly.
B.     Actual ERRs (under the CCEP)
The followng proxy ERR ranges are actual, ex-post calculations from the ongoing portfolio, without
shadow pricing of unskilled labor.
Economic infrastructure: both new investment and rehabilitation works must have an economic
rate of return superior to 12 percent to be eligible for project funding. Actual ERR ranges are as
follows:
*  Road enhancement or rehabilitation: 7 sub-projects with ERRs ranging from 31 percent to 47
percent, with an average of 38 percent. The main benefit is lower transport costs;
*  Protection against sand encroachment: 2 sub-projects with ERRs of 42 percent and 51 percent.
The main benefits are savings on sand removing operations after sand storms and lower transport
costs;
*  Storm drainage: 4 sub-projects with ERRs ranging from 25 percent to 32 percent, with an
average of 30 percent. The benefit is the protection against flood damage to households and
economic infrastructure,
*  Administrative buildings in new and poor areas of Nouakchott: 4 sub-projects with ERRs
ranging from 17 percent to 25 percent, with an average of 22 percent The benefit is savings on
rent, and

Rehabilitation of public facilities such as classrooms, health centers and administrative buildings: 29 sub-
projects with ERRs ranging from 21 percent to 119 percent, with an average of 36 percent. The benefit is
savings on total reconstruction in later years.
Commercial or revenue-earning projects: While none have been financed by IDA, Germany is
financing 8 sub-projects with ERRs ranging from 19 percent to 47 percent, with an average of
33 percent. Under the proposed project, the minimum rate of financial return for the sub-project
to be eligible will be 15 percent, and management will be contracted out to avoid increases of
municipal staff. For example, under the CCEP, the rehabilitation of the ALEG slaughter house
costs UM2. 1 million and will bring to the municipality an annual additional income of
UM468,000, which takes into account maintenance costs of UM25,000, resulting in a NPV of
UM1.5 million and an ERR of 29 percent.
Social projects: Construction of primary classrooms will be undertaken only in emergency cases and
on request from the Ministry of Education. Other social projects will follow sectoral policies
when they exist. Otherwise, projects will be selected on the basis of low ratio cost/number of
beneficiaries.
Municipal management projects would have a fiscal justification such as the rehabilitation of a tax
collection office with a rate of return of 61 percent. The benefit is an enhanced tax collection.
Other examples are street and property numbering to facilitate tax collection and private business
operations. Cost per lot is US$3 compared to US$40 for full cadasters. The expected additional
tax revenue over three years would be at least more than twice the investment costs.
3.     Alternative options. Experience in Mauritania and Senegal has shown that lower prices (by 10-
15 percent) and equal or higher quality of works are achieved through the AGETIPE model. This is due
to increased competition between contractors and rapid payments to contractors through contract
management procedures (Implementation Completion Report for the Senegal Publics and Employment
Project and the CCEP Mid-term review). The use of local consultants for design of works and for PIP
inventories would further develop local capacity at a lower cost than the hiring of staff in each city or
extensively using of expatriates.
4.     Beneficiary Contribution to financing. Beneficiary municipalities will have to bear up front a
part of the cost of their sub-projects as show below. This has proved, under the CCEP, an efficient way to
ensure beneficiary ownership, strong commitment and rigorous selectivity.
