POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1548-MAS)
PREFACE
1.      This report covers the Power Transmission project in Mauritius
supportad by Loan 1548-AAS. The loan for $15 million to the Central
Electricity Board (CEB), with the guarantee of the Government of Mauritius,
was approved in April 1978, became effective in January 1979 and was closed
in June 1985, 18 months after the original closing date.
2.      Part I and III were prepare! by Bank staff, based on information
available in the project files and information supplied by CEB.
3.      Part II is the summary of pro. :t implementation and outcome.
This summary was taken from the borrc-. q PCR dated August 1986.

PROJECT COMETION REPORT
lWI&flTIUS
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOJA 1548-HAS)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives and Description
4.      The project's main objectives were: (i) to assist CEB in cirrying
out its development plan for the period 1977-1982 by providing additional
power transmission and distribution capacity to supply points; (ii) to
increase reliability for the system operations; and (iii) to strengthen
CEB's organization and operations.
5.      The project included: (i) construction of 66-kV and 22-kV
transmission extensions (consisting of about 75 km of power transmission
lines, about 8 km of underground cables and 275 MVA of transformer
capacity); (ii) extensions to the distribution systems; (iii) construction
of a system control center; (iv) consulting services to carryout various
studies; and (v) training to strengthen the CEB's planning and system
control activities.
ExDerience and Results
6.      The project was originally scheduled to be completed in December
1983 but completion date was later revised to December 1985 due partly to
physical implementation problems including: (a) timely execution of works
as a result of delays in acquisition of lands for lines and wayleave
problems for substations; (b) lack of civil engineering staff who were at
that time fully enegaged with the execution of works for the Champagne
Hydroelectric Project; (c) delays in completion of works due to contract
disputes; and (d) CEB requested inclusion of additional components to the
project which were approved by the Bank.
7.      The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$18.9 million, with
a foreign exchange component of about 79%. The loan amount was US$15.0
million. The total actual project cost was US$15.7 million of which US$4.6
and US$11.1 million are local (29%) and foreign costs (71%) respectively.
Bank disbursements totalled $11.1 million corresponding to the foreign
exchange component.
8.      The project provided needed additional power transmission and
distribution capacity and enabled the transmission of additional and more
reliable power supply from sources of generation to bulk supply points.
The project enhanced the ability of CEB to provide domestic users in rural
areas greater access to power supply.   Furthermore, tne completion of the
new Load Dispatching Center facilitated and improved power system
operations.
9.      The outcome of the institutional objective of the project was
mixed (para. 7.03).

Ccnclusions. Findings and Lessons to be Learned
10.     The main findings and lessons to be learned are:
(a)   procurement delays as a result of CEB's
inability to process promptly large numbers af
procurement packages due to staffing
constraints was not appropriately identified
during appraisal;
(<)   the Bank correctly predicted that without
timely and adequate tariff adjustments, CEB
would not be able to meet financial targets
(e.g. CEB yielded inadequate rates of return
on revalued assets for most of the period); it
was, however, unfortunate that CEB's poor
financial performance was further exacerbated
by the unexpected decline in energy sales
caused by unforseen economic difficulties
during the project implementation period
(para. 6.01); and
(C)   the project's institutional objective was not
completely achieved because CEB delayed
implementation of proposed recommendations by
consultants in the Comprehensive Energy and
Tariff studies and also because CEB failed to
carry-out promptly action program towards: (a)
implementation of adequate tariff structure
(para. 7.03); ana (b) establishment of a
etrong planning unit within CEB (para. 11.02);
Conclusion
11.     With the completion of the transmission project, almost all power
transmission needs in Mauritius have been covered; only some minor
transmission network extensions are needed. The distribution Vietwork is
well developed and about 90-95% of the population has access to public
power supply. CEB expects that the main generatton project (Champagne
Hydroelectric Scheme) and power generation by sugar estates would meet the
system generation requirements up through the early 1990's.

2.      Background
2.01    The Central Electricity Board (CEB), the borrower, was established
in 1952 as a statutory body, following the Government's acquisition and
consolidation of heveral private electricity undertakings. Since 1956, CEB
has been the sole public supplier of electricity and has had the full
responsibility for operating and developing the interconnected electric
power system on the island. The Central Electricity Board Ordi:'ance of
1963 gave broad powers to CEB's Board in running the company, which the
Board can in turn delegate tv the General Manager. In April 1976 the
Ordinance was amended after consultation with the Bank to provide that the
Minister in charge can give "general directions" to the Board with which
the Board has to comply. Tariff changes are authorized by government.
2.02    Loan 355-HAS for US$7 million was the first loan to the power
sector in Mauritius. Loan 1548-MAS, of US$15 millicn for the power
transmission project, the second power sector loan, for which this is the
completion report, was an integral part of the long-range construction
program for transmission and primary and secondary distribution recommended
by consultants (Preece, Cardew and Rider) in 1976. The project was
considered the least cost transmission/distribution solution for meeting
the steadily increasing forecast demand.
3.      Proiect Objectives and Description
3.01    In April 1977, the Government on behalf of CEB, requested Bank
assistance in financing the foreign exchange costs of CEB's transmission
and distribution development program covering the period from 1978 to 1982.
An appraisal mission visited Mauritius in July 1977, and found that the
project is suitable for financing. The Loan became effective on January
23, 1979, although the Loan Agreement was signed on April 26, 1978. The
long period between Board approval and effectiveness was due to Government
delays in tariff increase which was a condition for loan effectiveness.
3.02    Proiect Obiectives:  The main objectives of the project were to:
(a)   provide additional transmission and
distribution capacity in order to transmit the
additional power from sources of generation to
bulk supply points;
(b)   extend the distribution facilities at
satisfactory frequency and voltage levels;



- 2 -
(C)   provide facilities to improve reliability of
system operations; and
(d)   strengthen the organization and operation of
CEB.
3.03    Proiect De-:ription:  The project consisted of the following
partsi
(a)   Construction of 66-kV and 22-kV transmission
extensions (consisting of about 75 km of
transmission lines, about 8 km of underground
cables and 275 ZVA of transformer capacity)
which form part of the development plan of CEB
for the period 1978-1982;
(b)   Extensions to CEBS's distribution system
(construction of 6.6 kV and lower voltage
distribution transformer stations and lines);
(c)   Construction of a System Control Center (load
dispatching center);
(d)   Consulting services (for studies: Long Range
Power Planning, Reorganization, Energy Sector,
Control Center and Training); and
(e)   Training for CEB's middle management and
professional staff.
4.      Proiect Design and Organization
4.01    The project was designed to support sector objectives described in
paragraph 3.02.   All relevant parties shared and understood these
objectives. It was clear to all concerned, especially those involved in
the physical implementation, that the project's main objectives were
essential in fulfilling the priority needs of CEB's long-range-construction
program for transmission and primary and secondary distribution. The scope
and scale of the project was appropriate in light of these objectives
although minor changes were made in design of physical components when
construction started. These changes, however, were within the overall
scope and original cost estimates of the project. Furthermore, when
surplus funds became available as a result of the rise in the exchange rate
of the U.S. Dollar between 1979 to 1985, new components were added to the
project (para. S.OS).   The addition of new components which was agreed by
both CEB and the Bank, however, necessitated extension of the agreed
project imT 'entation sche'-l.e.
4.02      . ne institutional aspect of the project, several studies were
proposes;  be financed under the loan to strengthen CE8's organization and
managema._   In particular, the Reorganization Study improved and
strengthened CEB's operations through the creation of an efficient
organization structure and development of a well-balanced and strong
personnel mix within the technical areas.
5.      Proiect Implementation
5.01    ImDlementation.  Actual sales of electricity were well below the
projected figures at appraisal. The lower than expected demand was caused
partly by: (a) stagnation of the economy, high rate of inflation and
worldwide recession during the project implementation years; (b) sharp
decline in the consumption of electricity in the commercial sectors mostly
due to the fall in sugar prices; and (c) domestic consumers conservation of



their power usage because of i.ncreased tariffs and devaluation of the local
currency. This outcome was unforseen because Mauritius was economically
stable at the time consultants conducted their study in 1975 and it was not
evident during appraisal that a severe world economic depression as a
result of the oil crisis was imminent.
5.02    The project r!sk associated with CEB's inability to meet financial
targets if tariffs were not adjusted at the times and of the magnitudes
required was correctly identified. The level of tariffs during most of the
project period was not sufficient to meet the rate of return and internal
cash generation requirements stipulated by the legal agreements. The poor
results were mainly caused by CEB's failure to implement appropriate tariff
adjustments on a regular and timely nmanner (para. 6.02 (c)) and poor sales.
5.03    Procurement.  Procurement etart-up waa delayed about six months
compared to original schedule d- -r:_d in the Appraisal Report.  This was
partlv due to CEB's internal prt.  -s ansociated with cumbersome
procurement decisions (too many sma.l ..ontracts for transmission and
distribution equipment) and inadequate staffing in CEB's project
department. Drastic changes in Government and in the composition of CEB
Board of Directors which occurred in 1982 and -.983 respectively also
necessitated revision of procurement schedule. Disagreement between CEB
and the Bank regarding contract award for transformers worth about US$1.15
million also resulted in almost 14 months delay in procurement of these
items. The dispute centered on Bank's refusal to agree with CEB's bid
evaluation; CE3 proposed to award the contract to a bidder which the Bank
did not consider the lowest evaluated responsive bidder. Despite CEB's
repeated justifications, the Bank firmly refused to finance the contract,
and the equivalent contract amount of US$1.15 million was consequently
cancelled in February 1984 and SDR loan amount was reduced. CEB thereby
sought non-Bank funds to finance the contract. Construction of other
project components was delayed about one to six months primarily due to
cyclones which occurred in 1977, 1979 and 1980.
5.04    Overall, CEB recognized that Bank procurement guidelines were
generally satisfactory. Despite delays and minor difficulties, most of the
bids received were highly competitive and a fair degree of standardization
of procured goods and equipment was reasonably achieved.
5.05    Proiect Cost.  The estimated total cost of the project at
appraisal was about US$18.85 million of which USS3.85 and US$15.0 million
was financed by the Borrower and the Bank respectively. The final cost was
about US$15.71 million of which about US$4.62 and US$11.09 million was
local and foreign costs respectively. Total foreign cost was lower than
estimated because of lower than anticipated quantity of equipment purchased
for the construction of the distribution systems and savings in the
contingencies. A comparison of the project costs, as estimated at
appraisal and actual costs, is shown in Table 3.5.A of Part III. Project
FAnancing is detailed in Table 3.5.B. Table 3.9 indicates the country
e:L aange rate variations during the project period.
5.06    Allocation of Loan Proceeds.  The original allocation of funds,
(estimated as of September 1983) and firal disbursements for the loan are
sho.wn in Table 3.5.8 in Part III. As a result of the appreciation of the
U.S. Dollar, CEB requested in 1982 and the lank approved, the allocation of
loan proceeds to finance additional project ;omponents within the original
project objectives including: (a) installation of a 66kV feeder bay at the
Wooton Substation; (b) replacement of 66kV OCB's at the Wooton Substation;
(c) reconstruction of Poudriere 22/6.6kV Substation; (d) reconstruction of
Vacoas 22/6.6kV Substation; (e) installation of a 66/22kV Substation at
Ebene; and (f) procurement of distribution materials for the
reconstruction, strengthening and extension of the primary and secondary
networks. CEB also requested the Bank in 1983 to reimburse expenditures



- 4 -
incurred by CEB with respect to civil works and materials used from their
stock for project implementation from the potential loan surplus. The
lank, however, denied this request as it could not be proven that uuch
goods had been procured according to Bank guidelines. The loan was
formally closed on June 30, 1985 and an undisbursed balance of US$2.8
million war cancelled on February 27, 1986.
6.      Proiect Results
6.01    Phsiocal and Ooerational-Results.   The key performance indicators
of the project as estimated at aplpraisal compared to actual results are
shown in Taole 3.4 of Part III. The demand for electricity has been fairly
stagnant as compared to appraisal ectimates because of the economic
depression caused by high oil prices and decline in sugar prices during the
project period. The unexpected declin. in demand prompted CEB in 1983 to
revise its demand forecasts downwards. Furthermore, CEB postponed its
earlier proposal to construct a coal-flred power plant immediately after
completion of the Champagne hydroelectric scheme 1/ and redirected its
efforts tewards rehabllitating old hydro power plants. CEB also met most
of its short-term power supply requirements by purcha, ing needed energy
from the sugar estates power generating plants. At project completion,
most of the newly built 22/6.6kV substations have operated much more
efficiently. The addition of adequate switchgear and upratlng of ex±sting
transformers enabled these substations to operate satisfactorily and
accomodate much higher loads. The power generation system has been more
secure and stable with the provision of more sophisticated protectlon
devices. The provision of additional equipment also improved system
dependability thereby reducing the incidence of power outages. The
completlon of the 66kV main ring around the island had also enabled CEB to
meet major power demands in many remote areas.
6.02    Financial Performance:  CEB's financial performance is summazired
below:
(a)   Audited accounts for Financial Years 1981,
1982 and 1983 were received on February 1983,
January 1984 and October 1984 respectively.
There is no available record to indicate
whether the FY84 audited accounts which was
due June 30, 1985 was received by the Bank- It
is very unlikely, however, that this was
submitted since the loan closed in June 1985.
(b)   Fixed assets were revalued on the basis of
increases in the consumer price index from
1964 onwards. RevaLuations of assets were
exceptionally high in 1980 and 1981 due to the
devaluation of the Mauritian Rupee in October
1979 and september 1981.
(c)   CEB's actual rates of return on average
revalued net fixed assets in operations are
1.9%, 3.9%, -0.8%, 1.2% and 3.3% compared to
8.5%, 8.2%, 8.2%, 8.3% and 8.4% estimated at
)J The Champagne Hydroelectric Scheme which was CEB's main generation project
was proposed by consultants (Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation of
Australia) ln its feasbility report of February 1979. It was recommended as
the least cost generation solution for meeting CEB's forecast power demand.
The dam was commissioned iL  1984.



appraisal for FY1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 and
1985 respectively. The unfavorable results
were primarily caused by extended delays in
implementation of required tariff adjustments.
According to CEB, it was not able to
immediately implement tariff increases because
of political reasons (e.g. election year) and
system deficiencies (e.g. frequent load
shedding resulting in severe power outages)
while the power facilities were still being
rehabilitated.
(d)   CEB was able to maintain  'tts account
receivables at a very satisfactory level.
Receivables were equivalent to about 1.5
months of sales during the period 1982 to
1985.
(e)   Implementation of the recommendations of the
tariff study undertaken by DAPECO, Electricite
de France in April 1984 was not promptly
undertaken by CEB and, therefore, the results
were not adequately assessed at project
completion.
6.03    Rate of Return.  The internal economic rate of return of the
project was estimated at 18% during appraisal, where benefits are measured
by incremental revenue attributable to the total investment in the system
and financial costs adjusted for taxes and foreign exchange shadow prices.
It should be noted, however, that the return is understated because the
improvement ingthe reliability of electricity supply and reduction in
system losses, which were achieved at project completion, were not taken
into account. The actual economic return has not been calculated by CEB.
It is our view that a full recalculation of the economic rate of return
would yield comparatively little additional insight and, therefore, has not
been carried out. However, it is likely that the economic rate of return
immediately after project closing was as high as the one estimated in the
SAR.
7.      Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.01    Proiect Benefit:  The project has had the following significant
benefits at project completion:
(&)   an increase in stability, reliability and
efficiency of the transmission and
distribution system;
(b)   an increase in system's reserve capacity which
would meet the country's demand for aa
extended period of time;
(c)   a reduction in system losses; and
(d)   improvement in the operation and management of
the power supply network.
7.02    Under normal circumstances, these benefits are likely to be
sustained through the project's economic life. It is worthwhile to note
that the project was set up flexibly for further maximization of benefits
in subsequent years through installation of additional equipment. For
example, additional transformers and distribution feeders can be installed
to meet unexpected increases in power demand. The rapid evolution of



- 6 -
technology which brought equipment and operating costs down and higher
maintenance standards also helped sustain these benefits.
7.03    Institutional Impact.  Several studies financed under the loan
were undertaken by consultants in order to assist CEB to meet effectively
its institutional goals. These studies include: (a) System Control Study
for the construction of dnv efficient System Control Center fully equipped
with adequate instruments and telemetering devices; (b) Comprehensive
Energy Study for the examination, utilization and allocation of indigeneous
and imported energy resources to various users on the basis of economic
costs and benefits; (c) Long Range Power Development Study for updating the
10-year Power Development Program formulated by Consultants in March 1978;
(d) Reorganization Study for improving CEB's organization and management
structure and operation; and (e) Tariff Study for determining the long-run
marginal costs of power supply. Among these completed studies,
recommendations of the System Control Study and the Long Rahge Power
Development Study were fully implemented during the project period.
Furthermore, recommendations of the Reorganization Study which included
proposed major changes in CEB's organization structure was carried out with
the exception of study's proposal to decentralize the Commercial Department
because CEB believed that spreading the Commercial Department would result
in excessive delegation of power for a relatively small country such as
Mauritius. While implementing the new organization structure, however, CEB
was not fully able to recruit highly qualified technical personnel to fill
middle and upper management level positions. CEB could not attract highly
qualified and experienced engineers from the private sector because of its
uncompetitive salary scheme. In order to overcome this problem, CEB
initiated a "cadetship" program by recruiting newly registered engineers
and providing them with approximately two years training in various
specialized technical areas where the need was most essential.
7.04    Implementation of recommendations proposed in the Comprehensive
Energy Study and Tariff study were not undertaken prior to project
completion and we have no available information to determine whether
further action was taken to pursue this matter. In the absence of follow-
up Bank or IDA-financed power/energy sector project in Mauritius after the
completion of the Power Transmission Project, we are unable to-ascertain or
comment further on the institutional impact of these and other studies.
8.      Bank's Performance
8.01    The Bank's performance has been satisfactory on the supervision of
the implementation of the physical components but the outcome of the
institutional aspect of the project was mixed because: (a' CEB failed to
promptly implement recommendations of the Comprehensive Energy and Tariff
studies (para. 7.04); and (b) CEB's internal institutional and technical
planning capability was not fully established and organized (para. 11.02).
The Bank, however, made positive contributions to the development of the
sector through the transformation of CEB into a more responsive and
structured power supply entity. The Bank also helped achieve the project's
basic objective of providing more reliable and efficient power supply
through addition and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution
facilities. Furthermore, the Bank vigorously promoted extensive dialogue
on energy and other related issues. These discussions led to the
formulation of an effective dialogue on sector-related development policies
and assisted in the satisfactory implemention of energy assessment
programs. Table 3.8 gives details of the supervision missions which were
timely and took place at least once a year between 1978 to 1985.



- 7-
9.      Borrower's Performance
9.01    CEB was the Borrower (with the guarantee of the Government of
Mauritius) and implementing agency. Table 3.7 in Part III contains a
review of the performance of CEB in complying with the covenants of the
loan and guarantee agreements. Government's performance was satisfactory
except for the delay in approval of required tariff adjustments which
caused CEB's non-compliance with the revenue covenants (para. 6.02 (c)).
CEB's management and supervision of physical implementation of project
components was good. Although delayed, most of the project components were
completed within reasonable time. Concerning CEB's compliance with legal
covenants, performance was fair because CEB failed to carry out the
recommendations of Bank-financed studies para. 7.03) within the period
specified in the legal agreement. For example, the legal agreement stated
that the completed tariff study based on long-term marginal costs of power
supply shall be discussed with the Bank no later than January 31, 1980 and
agreed recommendations implemented thereafter, but CEB indefinitely
postponed consideration of appropriate action to adjust tariffs (para.
7.04). There were also considerable delays in the submission of audited
financial statements (para. 6.02 (a)).
10.     Proiect RelationshiD
10.01   Bank relationship with Government and CEB on the project has been
good. However, the delay in receipt of audited financial accounts
constrained the Bank's ability to make timely assessments of CEB's
managerial and institutional performance. Nevertheless, good rapport
prevailed and to the extent possible under the circumstances of project
delays and financial covenant non-compliance, cooperation was attained and
many appropriate advice considered.
11.     Consulting Services
11.01   Technical.  CEB had no consultants for the construction and
supervision of the physical components of the project.
11.02   Studies.  The Loan Agreement provided for various studies (para.
7.03) to be completed by July 1979. Table 3.6 gives details of the purpose
of the study as it was defined at appraisal. These studies we±e undertaken
by consultants (EDF-DAFECO). The consultants' reports on CEB's
reorganization, control center and training were satisfactory but their
study pertaining to the long-range development energy program, although it
included numerous statistical data and economic calculations, lacked a
thorough evaluation of a least-cost alternative for meeting future demand.
As a result, the Bank advised CEB to undertake a comprehensive energy
master plan for the purpose of effectively identifying its future operating
requirements. As part of this exercise, the Bank offered Bank funds for
CEB to undertake a skills training program for its staff and carry out the
following short-term studies: (a) analysis of the composition of peak
demand; (b) full demand forecast; and (c) detailed system expansion
program. These proposals, however, did not materialize because the
government refused to use Bank loan to finance these activities. The Bank
also urged the Ministry of Energy and Internal Communications (MEIC) to
establish within CEB a system planning unit in order to strengthen CEB's
in-house capability to undertake comprehensive power system planning and
programming and to prepare major investment plans for the General Manager
and the Board fsr the overall development needs of the entity. The
government was not receptive to this recommendation and instead it
established its own energy planning administration supported by donor
technical assistance in relevant specialized areas of energy engineering
and economics. As a result, the development in CEB of essential power
systems planning capability was lacking and its capacity to apply
computerized planning methodologies for generation and distribution



- 8 -
expansion planning and investment programming remained limited in the face
of increasingly complex choices to optimize system expansion and
reliability at least coot.
12.     Proiect Documentation and RenortLna
12.01   The loan and guarantee agreements were adequate for achieving
project objectives in the key areas of institutional building and sector
development. The appraisal report for the project provided a useful
framework for review of project implementation by both the Bank and CEB.
As project revision became necessary in the course of project
implementation, it was discussed and agreed with the Bank, to allow for
appropriate reallocation and usage cf available funds. CEB submitted the
necessary information during project supervision and through quarterly
reports for presentation and updating of the execution of the works. The
provision of timely audited financial reports was less than satisfactory
(para. 6.02 (a)) and, the Bank has often relied on unaudited and draft
accounts in assessing the financial position of CEB. The reporting and
exchange of information regarding institutional building and financial
management strengthening was handled through annual supervision mission
reports and appropriate follow-up letters to MEIC.
12.02   CEB has submitted a project completion report dated August 1986
and their evaluation of project implementation and outcome is included in
Part II of this PCR.
13.     Conclusion and Follow-Up Action
13.01   The main goals of the power transmission project were to assist
CEB in carrying out its development plan for the period 1977-1982 by
providing reliable additional power transmission and distribution capacity
and strengthening CEB's organization and operations. The serious economic
recession during the early 80's hampered optinmum utilization of increased
power supply due to lower than expected growth in sales. The full benefit
of the project, however, was realized when the Mauritian economic situation
improved immediately after the end of the project period. The GDP growth
from 4.6% in 1984 to 6.5% in 1985 was the signal of the upward economic
trend. This economic progression prompted increased demand for energy and
most notably in additional electricity consumption by the manufacturing
secto- which accounted for over 50% cf Mauritian exports. Activities in
the sugar and tourism sectors also began to accelerate. While the Bank has
not been recently active in the power sector, this project and other
previous lending activities have contributed greatly in enhancing and
expanding power system operations in Mauritius.
13.02   The institutional objective of the project was not completely
achieved. The mixed result was partly due to CEB's failure to promptly
undertake action program to implement recommendations of two vital bank-
financed studies and weak internal planning capability at CEB. Future Bank
participation, if any, in the power sector in Mauritius could be in the
form of bank-financed technical assistance to CEB for strengthening its
institutional activities through: (a) enhancement of power systems planning
capability; (b) adoption of modern power utility operation including
maintenance and operation of electronic control systems; and (c)
introduction and adoption of state-of-the art computer systems application
for improving financial operations and management procedures.
13.03   The main findings and lessons to be learned are:
(a)   procurement delays as a result of CEB's
inability to process promptly large numbers of
procurement packages due to staffing



constraints was not appropriately identified
during appraisal;
(b)   the Bank correctly predicted that without
timely and adequate tariff adjustments, CEB
would not be able to meet financial targets
(e.g. CEB yielded inadequate rates of return
on revalued assets for most of the period); it
was, however, unfortunate that CEB's poor
financial performance was further exacerDated
by the unexpected decline in energy sales
caused by unforseen economic difficulties
during the project implementation period
(para. 6.01); and
(c)   the project's institutional objective was not
completely achieved because CEB delayed
implement&tion of proposed recommendations by
consultants in the Comprehensive Energy and
Tariff studies and also because CEB failed to
carry-out promptly action program towards: (a)
implementation of adequate tariff structure
(para. 7.03); and (b) establishment of a
strong planning unit within CEB (para. 11.02);

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MAURITIUS
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1548-MAS)
PART II
The following is the Borrower's evaluation of pro-ect implementation and
outcome which was taken from their PCR dated August 1986:
lit this early stage, the conclusions which can be reached about
the project outcome are bound to be impregnated with a degree of
uncertainty. The main reason being that the system is just starting to
function as originally planned, as there has been an economic recession
before 1983 which has revented growth of sales. It is only now that the
economy has started to recover from this setback and industrialization is
on the expanding move again. The full benefits of the project shall become
apparent when the system would be functioning to its full capacity and also
when the few outstanding project items would have been completed.
The original objective of the project, in providing additional
transmission and distribution capacity in order tc transmit additional
power from generating sources to bulk supply points and extension of
distribution facilities, has been reached. However, the actual demand is
lagging the anticipated demand.
The goals set up at appraisal were quite realistic and the
assumptions and strategies chosen accordingly. It should be borne in mind
that, when the Consultants produced their market survey in 1975, the
country was in a state of economic boom and it was not evident at that time
that the world at large would be going through severe economic crisis in
the coming years with a direct effect on the country.
The Bank mission appraisal team expressed some reserve in their
report in 1978 concerning the Board's ability to reach the financial
targets. It was po;.-ted out that, if the Board found itself unable to
implement tariff increases at times and of the required magnitudes, the
loan effectiveness would be postponed. In fact, the Board, although having
carried out tariff increases, has not been able to apply those-increases in
such proportion to give the desired financial results. This was mainly due
to stagnation in economy due to worldwide recession.
The benefits of the project, as already outlined, shall be more
pronounced when the industrial and commercial sectors would have attained
their goals by catching up with the delay sustained in the unfavourable
economic period. The project has set up a very flexible infrastructure and
that the benefits can be maximized over the years by the addition of more
equipment. Transformers and distribution feeders can be added to suit the
needs of the country. Capacitor banks shall shortly be installed at some
substations to improve the efficiency of the system. More up-to-date
techniques and higher maintenance standards should be adopted on the
distribution system to reduce outages due to breakdowns.
