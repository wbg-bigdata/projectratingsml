MAURITIUS
CHAPTER I
THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Mauritius has no known fossil fuel resources.  Its indigeneous
sources of commercial energy are small and include: (i) hydroelectric
power potential on the Grand River Southeast (GRSE) and the Grand River
Northwest (GRNW) with an estimated combined total of 260 GWh 1/; and (ii)
bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane refining with an annual production of
750,000 tons which is equivelent to about 200,000 tons of coal when used as
combustible, which is burned in generating plants located on sugar estates. 2/
1.02      Although the annual rainfall on the island is one of the highest in
the world (over 2,000 mm), the number of suitable hydroelectric sites is
limited by the following factors: (i) small catchment areas; (ii) juxtaposi-
tion of a good storage volume with a good head is not often available; and
(iii) there are many, old established water-rights on the available water
resources, mostly for irrigation purposes.
1.03      The largest catchment on the island is that of GRSE.  lt is ori-
ented toward the prevailing wind so that it obtains the maximum advantage
from orographic rainfall, and it is an area where demand for water from other
users is noticeably less than elsewhere. However, Mauritius is and will
continue to depend largely on imported fossil fuel unless new local resources
are discovered.
Energy Demand
1.04      The energy crisis has encouraged offshore oil exploration but so
far no deposits of any significance have been discovered. Meanwhile, imports
of refined oil products - there is no refinery on the island - have increased
from 115,000 tons in 1973 to 135,000 tons in 1976 while the cost of these
imports increased from about US$10 million to US$25 million. The share of oil
products in total imports now approximates 7%. Mauritius also imports coal,
albeit in small quantities (about 1,200 tons per annum).
1/   Total firm hydro potential of the country is estimated at 260 GWh of
which about 80 GWh has already been utilized.
2/   Yearly rate of bagasse production is about 750,000 tons (heat value of
bagasse is low - about 3,500 Btu per lb. = 1946 kcal per kg as received
basis).



-2 -
1.05      Commercial energy requirements in 1976 aggregated about 285,000
tons of coal equivalent. 1/ 85% of these were met by imported oil, 8% by
hydroelectric generation and 7% by burned bagasse (the residue from pro-
cessed sugarcane).
1.06      The share of electricity in total energy consumption has increased
from 28% in 1970 to 37% in 1976.   This share is expected to be about 34% in
1980.
Energy Policy
1.07      The Government has no firm energy policy yet to determine its objec-
tives and goals for the use of indigeneous and imported energy for various
sectors.  Hydropotentials of the two rivers GRSE and GRNW are being used both
for irrigation and electric power but a systematic allocation has not been
made. Electric energy produced by imported fuel oil has been priced well under
its cost and the use of electricity has been encouraged by CEB for many years.
As a result of this policy, the Central Electricity Board (CEB), which is in
charge of most generation and all distribution of electricity on the island,
has now a very peculiar daily load curve with two very distinctive growing
peaks (morning and evening) due mainly to increasing electric cooking and
water heating, which requires construction of additional generating facili-
ties. Liquified petroleum gas (LPG), coal and various petroleum products
could be alternative energy resources to electric energy for part of domestic
consumption due to higher heating efficiencies. It has been agreed that the
Government would carry out by July 1, 1979 a comprehensive energy study
regarding the use and allocation of indigeneous and imported energy resources
to various users on the basis of economic costs and benefits.
Existing Facilities
1.08      CEB has about 88 MW of power generating facilities, of which 62 MW
are diesel and the balance hydro. Further, 16 sugar estates own and operate
private generating plants based on process steam and bagasse, and two small
hydroelectric stations with a combined capacity of 44 MW. However, only 15 MW
of capacity is available for the use of CEB during each crop season (about 5
months in a year between July and November).
1.09      Sugar estates use cons:Lderable quantities of steam in the processing
of sugarcane. The steam is produced in boilers burning bagasse and part of
the steam is used to generate electric power. Some of the power is sold to
1/   Ton of Coal Equivalent (TEC):
I TEC             =  7 x 106 Kcal
1 ton fuel oil   =  1.37 TEC
1 GWh             =  475 TEC (based on thermal steam plant heat
rate of 3,300 Kcal/kWh)



- 3 -
CEB at favorable prices (average selling price is about M4 8 (US$41.2) per
kWh). Although bagasse could be used as a raw material for other products
such as paper and animal food, reconnaissance studies (prepared by sugar
estates) have shown that a paper mill of minimum economic size would use the
entire bagasse production of the island and would not be profitable because
sugar estates would have to burn fuel oil instead of bagasse to produce steam
and paper prices in the world markets are not stable. A fraction of bagasse
is already being used as animal food and there are no programs for exportation
due mainly to higher production costs of animal food process. Although the
Government and CEB are considering more efficient use of bagasse and operation
of estates plants during inter-crop season, plans have not yet been firmed up
and studied in detail. To encourage inter-crop season operation of bagasse
plants, CEB will make an agreement with one of the sugar estates soon. Fuel
oil will be used for energy production during the inter-crop season.
1.10      CEB's diesel generation is confined to two stations, Fort Victoria
and St. Louis, both close to Port Louis, the capital. At end-1976, the
total installed capacity was 62.4 MW of which 14.4 MW was at St. Louis (8
sets) and 48.0 MW (8 sets) at Fort Victoria. Set sizes and manufacturers are

struction and are expected to be commissioned in September 1978.

1.12      Only the 8 MW Tamarind and 4 MW Eau Bleue schemes have significant
reservoirs capable of supplying power towards meeting the system daily peak
demand. Tamarind Falls must be operated primarily to fit the needs of irri-
gation. The rest of the hydro stations have little firm supply capability,
although they do permit the economizing of diesel fuel.
1.13      CEB has an extensive 66, 22 and 6.6-kV network covering the whole
island. At present, overhead lines measure about 3,500 km and underground
cables about 100 km.
1.14      For many years, 22 kV has been the main transmission system
voltage but, with the increase in demand in recent years, the 22-kV network
is being overlaid with a 66-kV system. Eventually, 66 kV will become the
main transmission voltage with the 22-kV network split and used as radial
feeders. The distribution feeders system consists of a 6.6-kV network in the
urban and industrial areas and 22-kV in the rural areas.
1.15      At present, the only 66-kV transmission plant in operation are four
undergrond power cables interconnecting the Fort Victoria and St. Louis power
stations and the double circuit overhead line between St. Louis and Wooton
substation. However, it is intended that the overhead lines between St. Louis
and Nicholay Road (double circuit) and between Wooton substation and the Ferney
hydroelectric station (single circuit) will be uprated from 22 kV to 66 kV for
which they were originally designed. This will provide a main transmission
tie between the west and southwest of the island. In the future, a similar
link to the north of the island by interconnecting Nicholay Road with F.U.E.L.
(a sugar estate) via Belle Vue will be constructed. All the 66-kV substations
are outdoor single bus-bar using 1,500 MVA minimum oil circuit breakers. The
system is solidly grounded and the substations are continuously manned.



-5-
1.16      At present, the backbone of the network is the 22-kV system which
forms a ring around the island and is strengthened by a tie between Wooton
and Ferney, currently operated at 22 kV although insulated for 66 kV. Most
of the 22-kV feeders have "T" branch connections supplying rural loads and
polemounted automatic reclosing circuit breakers are used on many of these to
improve service. The majority of the 22-kV overhead lines are strung on
pre-stressed concrete poles manufactured by CEB.
1.17      In general, all the 22-kV substations are outdoor using minimum
oil circuit breakers rated at 440 MVA.  Minor substations and "T" connections
are protected by pole-mounted fuses. The system is solidly grounded although
increasing generating plant may require the use of resistance grounding,
especially in the vicinity of St. Louis.
1.18      The 6.6-kV distribution system consists almost entirely of overhead
lines on pre-stressed concrete poles. The 6.6-kV substations are predomi-
nantly of indoor construction using metal clad bulk oil switchgear. A table
giving statistical data on CEB's power system and a map of the existing power
facilities are shown in Table 1.1 and Map 1.1 (IBRD No. 12246 R) at the end of
this chapter.
Access to Service and Rural Electrification
1.19      The Government has given high priority to rural electrification
for many years. At present, more than 80% of the population has access to
electricity through 119,158 domestic customers' connections, compared to a
total population of about 850,000. Only a few villages remain to be electri-
fied. CEB's current plans call for full electrification of the island by
end-1978.
1.20      The high degree of electrification at present has been achieved
largely through Government grants and soft loans towards the unprofitable
rural electrification. In addition, CEB has promoted the extensive use of
electricity by importing electrical appliances and selling them at a nominal
profit. The average consumption per domestic consumer, however, is low -
about 65 kWh per consumer per month which is attributable to the relative
poverty of some 8,000 customers who each use less than 5 kWh per consumer per
month and 21,500 customers who use less than 10 kWh per month.

CHAPTER II
THE BORROWER
The Borrower
2.01      The Central Electricity Board (CEB) would be the borrower of the
proposed loan, which would be the second Bank operation in the power sector
in Mauritius. CEB was the beneficiary of Loan 355-MAS (US$7 million) made
in 1963, before independence, to Mauritius guaranteed by the UK to help
finance the foreign exchange costs of the first stage of the Fort Victoria
Diesel Station together with a transmission expansion component. CEB demon-
strated satisfactory technical and administrative capacity in completing
that project successfully within the estimated construction schedule and
project cost.
2.02      CEB was established in December 1952 as a Statutory Board as a
result of the Government's acquisition and consolidation of several private
electricity undertakings. Since July 1956, CEB has been the sole public
supplier of electricity and has had the full responsibility for operating
and developing the interconnected electric power system on the island.
2.03      The Central Electricity Board Ordinance of 1963 gave broad powers
to CEB's Board in running the company, which the Board can in turn delegate
to the general manager. In April 1976, the Ordinance was amended after
consultation with the Bank to provide that the Minister in charge, currently
the Minister of Power, Fuel and Energy (MPFE), can give "general directions"
to the Board with which the Board has to comply. The present arrangements
are satisfactory.
Organization
2.04      CEB's Board of Directors consists of 11 members comprising a
chairman, general manager, three representatives of Government Ministries
(Finance, Power, Fuel and Energy and Economic Planning and Development), a
representative of the Central Water Authority (CWA), two representatives of
the respective urban and rural electricity consumer groups and three repre-
sentatives from the private sector. The Governor-General appoints all the
non-ex-officio members of the Board by nomination of the Minister of Power,
Fuel and Energy. The Board meets normally once a month and is active. A
general manager is responsible for day-to-day operations. CEB has had capable
general managers since its inception. The present general manager is also
well experienced and competent.
2.05      The organizational structure of CEB is shown in Chart 2.1 at the
end of this chapter. CEB has seven main departments; namely, Generation/
Thermal, Generation/Hydro, Transmission and Distribution/Planning and Con-
struction, Transmission and Distribution/Operation and Maintenance, Commer-
cial, Accounts and Personnel. CEB also has two other smaller departments: a
Secretary's Department which is mainly responsible for preparation of Board
meetings, and an Internal Auditor's Department which is at present also
handling financial forecast exercises in addition to its auditing duties.



-9-
The heads of technical departments participate in the generation planning;
they are mostly occupied by the day-to-day operations of their respective
thermal and hydroelectric plants.
2.06      The present structure apparently has evolved on an ad hoc basis over
the years. Although it is reasonably adequate for CEB to conduct its opera-
tions, it could be further improved particularly in relation to the generation
and financial planning functions. CEB has recognized the need for an organi-
zation and management study, which would also include a review of the existing
management information system with a view to recommending improvements. It
has been agreed that this study would be completed by July 1, 1979 and that
implementation of such recommendations as are agreed with the Bank would
begin immediately thereafter.
Management and Staff
2.07      CEB is reasonably well-managed.  Since 1970 its staff has been
growing at an average rate of 2.6% per annum as against an average growth rate
of 9.7% per annum in unit sales during the past decade and reached a total of
about 1,600 at the end of 1976. The size of the staff is reasonable taking
into consideration the scope of CEB's operations. Approximately, one-third
of the staff are qualified personnel; the rest are semi-skilled and unskilled
workers. 1/ Like many operating concerns in Mauritius, CEB's management has
been preoccupied over the past few years with an unusual amount of labor
unrest. Nevertheless, the CEB which has a competent person in charge of
personnel department has been able to deal effectively with these problems.
Operations and Maintenance
2.08      The operations and maintenance of the power plants and transmis-
sion systems are good. Since fuel consumption of CEB represents about 7%
of the island's total fuel requirements, major efforts have been made to
reduce diesel oil consumption which is expensive and to substitute consump-
tion of less expensive residual oil in electricity generation. CEB has
successfully modified diesel engines burning light oil to burn heavy fuel
oil (residual oil) and has reduced fuel expenses substantially.
2.09      The system control activities need some improvement, particularly in
the areas of system frequency and voltage control and reactive load supply.
The proposed project, therefore, provides for the construction of a suitable
system control center (paras. 3.14 and 3.15).
Training
2.10      With assistance from the French Government, Electricite de France
(EDF) set up a-vocational training school for CEB in 1974. An EDF engineer
presently runs the school but it is expected that a Mauritian engineer, after
1/   Workers who work in transmission/distribution construction, security
guard services and the like.



- 10 -
completing an on-going training program in France, will take over the manage-
ment of the school in 1978. The instructors of the school are Mauritians who
have been trained in France by EDF. The program offered by the school com-
bines theoretical courses with practical training for a period of about three
years and has been very successful. There are at present about 60 apprentices
participating in the program. The school plans to open refresher courses for
other employees of CEB as well. At the upper echelon, CEB has sponsored
students for courses abroad and at the University of Mauritius. CEB's train-
ing program appears satisfactory.
2.11       To assist CEB in its training efforts and to improve its planning
and system control activities as mentioned in paragraph 2.09, an amount
of US$200,000 has been included in the proposed loan to finance short-term
(8-10 months) overseas training for about eight of CEB's engineers/managers.
CEB will continue to carry out with its own funds the rest of its overall
training program. It has been agreed that CEB would submit by April 1, 1979
a proposed training program to the Bank for review before implementation.
Accounting and Audit
2.12       CEB's accounts, which were computerized in 1976, have been well kept
and reports have been prepared reasonably promptly. The accounting procedures
and practices are satisfactory, but the budgeting process and cost control
mechanisms could be improved. CEB's budgets have proven systematically opti-
mistic essentially because of over estimation regarding hydroeletric power
production and under estimation of costs; as a result, CEB's tariff increases
to meet its financial objectives have proved to be too low in several instan-
ces (para. 4.04). At the same time, although a monthly information management
system is in effect, little use is made of it for cost control purposes.
These areas have been discussed with CEB and would be thoroughly reviewed and
dealt with in the aforementioned organization and management study (para. 2.06).
2.13       CEB's accounts are audited annually by De Chazal du Mee & Co., a
local auditing firm with links to Coopers and Lybrand of the U.K. The scope
of the audit is generally satisfactory. It has been agreed that CEB's annual
accounts would be audited and submitted to the Bank, together with the
auditors' report, within six months of close of the year.
Billing and Collection
2.14       All meters are read and billed every month, with the exception of
Government accounts, which are read and billed quarterly. Billing is fully
computerized for the Government and maximum demand accounts and it is only
half-mechanized for the remaining accounts. Some customers' computer-printed
bills are calculated and completed by hand and delivered on the spot to the
consumers to expedite collection. This arrangement is effective in view of
the fact that houses on the island are often not numbered. CEB has at present
77 meter readers for some 130,000 accounts. Each reader receives a small
bonus for every meter reading which he makes over and above his required
minimum quota.



- 11 -
2.15      Collections have been good with accounts receivable averaging
about 70 days of billings during the past three years. This is obviously
attributable to a strict policy of charging 10% penalty if bills are not
paid within 20 days after delivery and of disconnecting three weeks there-
after. CEB has 12 cash offices in urban centers and 3 mobile cash units for
outlying rural areas.
Insurance
2.16      CEB's plant are not presently insured against fire, explosion,
flood or cyclones. Further, no reserve exists against such damages. CEB has
agreed to undertake a study on the merits of a coverage of generating plant
and transmission and distribution assets against major disasters and to deter-
mine whether commercial insurance is preferable to a funded reserve, and that
the recommended course of action would be implemented not later than July 1,
1979.

CHAPTER III
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Power Market
3.01      Ten years ago (in 1966), the population of Mauritius was about
730,000. 1/ CEB generated and purchased 112 GWh, giving a per capita usage
of about 153 kWh. By 1976 the population has risen to about 840,000 and
electric energy generation and purchase by CEB was 270 GWh, or about 321 kWh
per capita. Thus, an increase of 15% (about 1.4% per annum) in the population
was accompanied by an increase of 110% (about 7.78% per annum) in per capita
electricity production and 141% (about 9% per annum) in total power genera-
tion. The growth has been particularly rapid since 1970 with an average of
12% growth rate per annum. The current mix of energy sales is as follows:
41% goes for domestic sales, 23% for commercial sales and 28% for industrial
sales; the balance goes essentially for irrigation. A discernible trend since
1970 has been the more rapid growth of commercial and industrial sales which
increased their combined market share from 38.5% in 1970 to 46% in 1975. The
number of connections rose by about 54% (about 4.4% per annum) from 86,187 to
132,945 and average revenue per kWh rose by about 96% (about 7% per annum)
from Mi 19.21 (US¢4.03 2/) to Mi 37.84 (USa 5.82) in the same period. Table
3.1 shows CEB's annual generation and sales (in GWh) in 1970-1976 period.
3.02      Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR), a U.K. consulting firm employed by
CEB, completed a detailed Power Market Survey in February 1975. The conclu-
sions of this survey were still considered valid as of early 1976. 3/
CEB and the Bank mission revised PCR's maximum demand figures on the basis
of 50% system load factor (against PCR's assumed load factor of 52%). This
slightly revised (about 4% higher maximum demands) forecast was then used as
a basis for preparing the Generation and Transmission Development Plans.
The forecasts of energy sales and maximum demand over the 1977-1986 period
are given in Table 3.2.
3.03      The forecasting methodology used by PCR and CEB was based on trend
analysis for each category of consumers. The following main assumptions
were made to produce the forecast:
(i) the annual growth rate in domestic sales would gradually decline
from 14% in 1975 to 8.5% in 1980 (due mainly to the application
of the proposed long-range incremental cost-based tariff begin-
ning 1979) and would remain at this 8.5% level from 1980 onwards;
1/   Excluding Island of Rodrigues.
2/   By prevailing exchange rate of US$1 = MR 4.76.
3/   The actual 1976 and 1977 results are broadly in line with the 1975
survey.



- 14 -
(ii)  the annual growth in commercial sales would gradually decline
from 9.1% in 1975 to 7.5% in 1982 and onwards (due mainly to
saturation).
(iii) the annual growth in industrial sales would gradually decline
from 14.9% in 1975 to 10.7% in 1983 and onwards (due mainly to
saturation).
Demand forecasts for very large industries such as the fertilizer factories
were included individually on the basis of current plans.
3.04      PCR also anticipated that the morning peak, now 89% of the evening
peak, would gradually approach the evening peak. This phenomenon is mostly
due to the faster growth rates of the industry and tourism markets and will
create difficulties in the day-time maintenance of units.
Generation Program
3.05      Based on the market survey mentioned in para. 3.02, PCR recommended
a generation development program for CEB, which includes: (i) a 12-MW gas
turbine (1976); (ii) a 12-MW diesel set at St. Louis (1978); and (iii) two
12-MW diesel sets at a new power station at Mer Rouge (1979). A further four
12-MW diesel units totalling to 48 MW would be added to Mer Rouge by 1986.
3.06      The above PCR proposal was altered by CEB on the following grounds:
(i) CEB felt that the gas turbine was uneconomic;
(ii)  one should assume, for planning purposes, two consecutive
years of drought extending from November to January;
(iii) the nominal capacity of the St. Louis power station must
be derated from 14 MW to 8 MW because some units are so old
that it is not possible to deliver nameplate ratings;
(iv)  overall firm capacity of the hydroelectric stations is
only 6 MW because water is not available to operate
hydro units at their nameplate ratings;
(v) two 6-MW sets at Fort Victoria could be out of service at
any one time because of maintenance and/or failure (their
availability record has proven poor so far); and
(vi)  the proposed site for the new thermal plant at Mer Rouge
is not suitable because it would be more economical to
extend the existing St. Louis station near Port Louis.
3.07      CEB's generation program, as was submitted to the mission (so far,
not shown as the least cost solution), is as follows:  (a) two 12-MW diesel
sets at St. Louis (1978), followed by two 12-MW diesel sets;(1979); and (b) 15
MW Quatre Soeurs and 5-MW Diamamouve (upstream of Quatre Soeurs) hydroelectric
projects (1980). Development beyond 1980 and until 1986 would include three



- 15 -
additional 12 MW sets at Mer Rouge. Chart 3.1 shows the forecast of maximum
demand and installed and firm capacity. CEB has no system reserve studies
based on system simulation (probabilistic) methods. Calculation of firm
thermal capacity is based on CEB's experience and statistics for availability
of each generat-ng unit, maintenance schedules for the thermal power plants
and expected availability of future sets. On this basis two largest diesel
sets (6.5 MW each, within the 10 units, para. 1.10) at Fort Victoria and one
large set (12 MW) plus two small sets (1.6 MW old sets) at St. Louis Station
have been assumed as system thermal reserve.
3.08      The project design study for the Quatre Soeurs Hydroelectric Project
was prepared in 1976 by Electrical Power Development Consultants (EPDC), U.K.
The consultant has prepared tendering documents for all the major components
of the project and contractors' offers were received in October 1977. CEB,
the Government and interested lenders (BADEA and CCCE) are now reviewing the
merits of the project on the basis of actual tenders and will decide whether
or not to proceed with it.
3.09      Central Water Authority (CWA) is now considering developing a multi-
purpose irrigation/water supply scheme at Baptiste/Guibies. Due mainly to
high costs (the lowest contractor's offer received in 1976 was about MR 215
million compared to the original 1974 cost estimate of MR 60 million), the
merits of the scheme are now being reviewed.
3.10      As was mentioned earlier (para. 1.07), while the island enjoys ample
rainfall, there is competition for water use between irrigation, domestic and
industrial consumpion, and hydroelectric power. The program is complicated
further by the existence of water rights dating, in some cases, back to the
eighteenth century. In view of the already large investment in hydroelectric
plant and the two hydroelectric projects now under review (Baptiste/Guibies
and Quatre Soeurs), it would be useful to determine how water should be
allocated on the basis of economic costs and benefits. CEB's generation
construction programs also require further optimization to achieve least cost
solution for meeting the forecast demand. Government and CEB have agreed that
CEB would update the 10-year generation development program prepared in March
1976 by PCR by July 1, 1979 and would periodically review its construction
program in consultation with the Bank.
Transmission and Distribution Program
3.11      A long-range construction program for transmission and primary and
secondary distribution has been prepared by PCR in the March 1976 report.  It
covers the future development of the transmission system from 1977 to meet
the steadily increasing demand. With the planned program the capacity of the
transmission lines constructed by 1981/82 would be sufficient to cope with the
anticipated loads until the year 1990. Thus, after 1982, the program is
mainly confined to adding transformers and switchgear at the proposed 66/22-kV
substations. The total cost of CEB's transmission/distribution program for
the period 1977-1982 is about MR 210 million (US$32.3 million). The proposed
project is an integral part of this program and is the least cost transmission/
distribution solution for meeting the forecast demand and it would not be
affected by the forthcoming decisions on the generation development program



- 16 -
in respect of Quatre Soeurs and/or Diamamouve Hydro Schemes.  Only one item
(Item No. 3 on Table 3.3), 4 km of 22-kV Guibies line would not be constructed
(less than 2% of project construction cost) if the Government decides to can-
cel Guibies Scheme. In this case, the funds allocated for this item (US$0.38
million) would be used for the construction of extensions to the CEB's dis-
tribution system.
Project Area and Objectives
3.12      In April 1977, the Government, on behalf of CEB, requested Bank
assistance in financing the foreign exchange costs of CEB's transmission and
distribution development program covering the period from 1978 to 1982. The
appraisal mission visited Mauritius in July 1977, and found that the project
is recommendable for financing. The main project objective is to provide
additional transmission and distribution capacity in order to transmit the
additional power from sources of generation to bulk supply points and extend
the distribution facilities at satisfactory frequency and voltage levels.
The proposed project would also provide facilities to improve reliability of
system operations and would strengthen the organization and operation of CEB.
Transmission lines, substations and distribution plant included in the pro-
posed project area are located in the western part of the island where about
80% of the total population and most of Mauritius' industry is situated.
Location of project area is shown on the attached Map 3.1 (IBRD 13082).
Project Description
3.13      The Project consists of the following parts:
(a) Construction of 66-kV and 22-kV transmission extensions
(consisting of about 75 km of transmission lines, about
8 km of underground cables and 275 MVA of transformer
capacity) which form part of the development plan
of CEB for the period 1978-1982;
(b) Extensions to CEB's distribution system (construction of
6.6-kV and lower voltage distribution transformer stations
and lines);
(c) Construction of a System Control Center (load dispatching
center);
(d) Consulting services; and
(e) Training.
3.14      Detailed project components, construction schedule and principal
characteristics of the substations and transmission lines are given in Table
3.3. Location of all transmission items are shown on the attached map (IBRD
13082). CEB's existing System Control Center at Curepipe is not adequate for
system operations control particularly with regard to switching operations,
load dispatching and system safety. It has been agreed that CEB would
complete by July 1, 1979 a detailed system control study regarding the
design of a load dispatching and switching facilities and implement it as
agreed with the Bank. This study would be carried out with the assistance of



- 17 -
consultants financed under the proposed Bank loan and would be based on the
recommendations of PCR in its 1976 report.
3.15      The consulting services proposed under the project include various
consultants as necessary to carry out (i) the system control studv (paras.
2.09 and 3.14), (ii) the comprehensive energy study (para. 1.07), (iii)
the updating of the 10-year power development program prepared by PCR in
March 1976 (para. 3.10), and (iv) the reorganization study for CEB (para.
2.06). The proposed training component is geared mainly to strengthening
CEB's planning and system control activities as was explained in para.
2.11.
Cost Estimates
3.16      The estimated total cost of the project is MR 122.55 million
(US$18.85 million equivalent), of which MR 97.50 million (US$15.00 million),
or about 80% would be in foreign exchange. These costs are before financing
charges and interest during construction. The Project is exempt from custom
duties and taxes. The cost estimates, which are detailed in Table 3.4, are
summarized below:

3.17      The project costs are based on CEB consultants' estimates and
recent contractor's offers for similar equipment and works and were revised
by the mission. The base costs are expressed in December 1977 prices. Costs
for the engineering and administration are estimated at 6% of estimated costs
of equipment and civil works (70% of engineering costs is in local currency).
Physical contingencies of 10% of civil works, equipment, training and consult-
ing services have been added. Local costs have been assumed to escalate by
10% in 1978, 9% in 1979 and 8% thereafter; annual foreign price escalation for
civil works has been taken at 8% for 1978, 7.5% for 1979 and 7% thereafter,
and foreign price escalation for equipment was assumed at 7% for 1978, 6.5%
for 1979 and 6% thereafter.
3.18      Estimates of the foreign exchange costs of the project at about 80%
are high but justifiable as local costs would consist only of land, labor
and some material for civil works construction (sand, lumber for formwork,
etc.) while equipment, steel towers (66-kV lines), wood poles or cement and
steel for concrete poles (22-kV lines) and line material would be imported.
Financing
3.19      The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project excluding interest and commitment charges
during construction on the Bank loan. The balance of the project costs would
be financed from CEB's own funds.
Implementation
3.20      The project will be administered by the staff of CEB.  The Project
is expected to be completed by mid 1983; disbursements would continue to
December 31, 1983 due to retention money. While the majority of the trans-
mission works will be executed by force account, CEB would use contractors
for civil works, tower supply and erection and the like to supplement its
semi-skilled and unskilled labor and transportation capacity. The installa-
tion of substations included in the project will mainly be executed by CEB
staff which is satisfactory. Most of the substations are extensions of
existing sites and no problems are expected in the acquisition of new sites
for the remainder or in routing the tranmission lines. The extensions to
CEB's distribution system included in the Project would consist of many
smaller 6.6-kV transformers, switchgears, power lines and customer connections
and would be progressively carried out by CEB after consultation with the
Bank.
Engineering
3.21      CEB staff has had substantial experience in the preparation of bid
documents, design and execution of 22-kV and lower voltage transmission line
works. In the development of their 66-kV network, they have carried out a
great part of the design functions with their own staff supplemented by the
services of manufacturers of equipment and material. Therefore, engineering,
construction and also construction supervision will essentially be made by CEB
staff.



- 19 -
Procurement
3.22      All imported equipment and materials for project works would be
procured by international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement.
3.23      Reinforced concrete transmission line poles (for 22-kV lines) would
be produced by CEB workshops using imported cement and steel. CEB has pro-
duced concrete poles for many years. Production cost is cheaper than imported
concrete poles due mainly to transportation difficulties. Concrete poles are
very heavy and easily breakable; therefore, they need extensive and very
expensive care during loading, unloading and overseas transportation. Other
transmission towers/wood poles, conductors, hardware and insulators would be
purchased from foreign sources on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Consultants would be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank.
Disbursements
3.24      Disbursement from the loan would be made against 100% of foreign
expenditures for equipment and materials directly imported for the project,
and 100% of foreign expenditures for consultants, systems studies and training
services. Disbursements for the above would be fully documented. An estimated
disbursement schedule is given in Table 3.5. Disbursement is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1983.
Monitoring System
3.25      Project monitoring standards have been agreed with CEB. Major
project elements to be monitored against target dates would be the contract
awards and the construction of a 66-kV transmission line between St. Louis and
Henrietta in 1980. Financial and management monitoring would focus on (a)
financing plans under five-year forecasts prepared annually; (b) rate of
return; (c) collection of revenues; and (d) staffing (reorganization and
training). Guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in Appendix
3.1.
3.26      After the completion of the project, CEB will prepare a "project
completion report" on the basis of an outline agreed with the Bank.
Environment
3.27      The impact of the project on the environment is small.  Visual ef-
fects and, to a lesser extent, radio interference are the principal matters
of concern; both can and should be kept at acceptable levels since the voltage
levels are relatively low and the project will be constructed on the basis of
internationally known standards.

1/ The loss of sales attributed to cyclone Gervaise (February 1975) has been estimated by CEB at 23 GWh.
2/ Others include HMS - Mauritius (U.K. Communication Base), CEB soundries and some Government offices
and premises. The drop in 1975 and 1976 is due to cyclone Gervaise and leave of British military
forces from the base and also to increase in other consumer sales.

Project Monitoring Guidelines
There are a number of areas described below which are key elements in the efficient ope:sttion of the utility
and the success of the project. These have been discussed with the Borrower.
Main areas for establishing a monitoring system are described below:
1. Suggested Targets for Construction of Plant Covered by the Project
1.01      Actual implementation progress should be compared monthly with planned targets.  Some important target dates
are tabled below:
Description                                Target Dates
Preparation of all Tender Documents        April 15, 1978
Invitation to bid for Equipment           May 31, 1978
Invitation to bid for Lines               May 31, 1978
Tender Period                              May 31 - August 31, 1978
Report on Tenders                          September 30, 1978
Contract Award                             November 30, 1978
Construction of Civil Work                 September 30, 1978
Erection of Substations                   October 1978 - June 1983
Erection of Lines                         October 1978 - June 1983
Commissioning of entire Project            June 30, 1983
1.02      In case of difficulties in keeping target dates for various works, available CEB's stock material will be used.
Such material then will be replaced by the material bought by the Bank funds.
2. Targets for Training
2.01      Staged output of training activities will be checked against targets.  Detailed targets to be based on training
plans are presently being prepared by CEB.
3. Targets for System Operations
3.01      Implementation of the new tariff, based on the recommendations of the Bank (para. 4.10), and the installation of
new meters (time of the day, season of the year type tariffs for large domestic, industrial and irrigation customers) as
compared to an agreed schedule will be monitored.
3.02      Records will be maintained comparing the targets against actual results in:
(a) Hydro production (in kWh);
(b) Diesel production (in kWh);
(c) Steam production (in kWh) from sugar estates power plants;
(d) Purchase from estates plants (in kWh);
(e) Power consumption (by classification);
(f) Consumption of power plants (in kWh);
(g) Average tariff level (in ¢ per kWh);
(h) Number of connections (by classification);
(i)  System losses (by operating voltages);
(j) Number of interruptions to service and their durations;
(k) Major equipment failures;
(1) Number of staff (by classification); and
(m) Frequency and voltage drift.
3.03      Reorganization of CEB against the targets based on the recommendations of the reorganization study is required.
4. Financial Indicators
4.01      (a)  Contribution to capital expenditures from internal cash generation from 1977-1982 as measured by historic
performance and CEB's five-year forecast;
(b) Rate ofreturn on average revalued fixed assets in operation; and
(c) Number of days electricity sales uncollected.

CHAPTER IV
FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
4.01      Since 1972 CEB has failed to meet the two most important financial
objectives set out under Loan 355-MAS; namely, to earn a minimum 8% annual
return on net operating assets based on historical costs and to maintain a
debt service coverage of at least 1.5. This unsatisfactory performance was
brought about mainly by rapid cost escalations, particularly fuel costs,
which were not met by adequate and timely tariff increases, and partly by
the adverse effect of the cyclone "Gervaise" in 1975 (para. 4.04). CEB's
financial condition is expected to improve following a 30% raise in tariffs
made in June 1977. Another tariff increase of the same magnitude will be
implemented in October 1978 which will fully restore CEB's financial viabil-
ity (para. 4.09).
4.02      The financial projections, which are presented in this report, have
taken account of CEB's generation development program envisaged at appraisal
and should be updated as this program evolves and materializes and as they
would inevitably affect CEB's overall financing plan over the construction
period of the proposed project. Bank supervision missions will pay special
attention to this aspect.
Past Operating Results and Financial Position
4.03      CEB's income statements for the years 1972 to 1976 are shown in
Table 4.1 and summarized below:

The above operating results, if calculated per kWh sold basis, would be as
follows:

Year    (million kWh)       (M Cents/kWh)        (M Cents/kWh)       (M Cents/kWh)

1973           153               20.8               18.2                 6.6
1974           173               28.8               26.2                13.7
1975          184                31.2               32.7                16.9
1976          225                37.1               35.2               20.0
4.04      It is noted from the above table that during the five-year period
from 1972 to 1976, while operating expenses per kWh sold increased by 120%
of which 76% was attributable to the quadrupled generation costs, average
revenues per kWh increased by only 77%. This was clearly insufficient; in
fact, average tariffs did not even keep pace with the inflation in Mauritius
which totalled 90% during 1972-1976. As a result, CEB experienced serious
financial difficulty as indicated by its marginal debt service coverage and
its unsatisfactory rate of return which deteriorated from 7.8% in 1972 to
3.9% in 1976 much below the required minimum of 8%. CEB suffered exceptional
losses in 1975 mainly caused by cyclone "Gervaise" which hit the island in
February. The loss of sales alone was estimated at 23 GWh, or MRs 7 million
(12% of annual sales), to which must be added the cost of rehabilitating
the power system. CEB ended 1975 with a net loss of MRs 7.5 million which was
fully compensated by grants from the Government.
4.05      Because of its poor earnings during 1972-1976, CEB contributed very
little towards the financing requirements during this five-year period. The
cash flow statements in Table 4.2 indicate that over this period, CEB's cash
contribution from its own resources totalled MRs 4.0 million including MRs 5.2
million of non-operating incomes and a negative MRs 1.2 million in net internal
cash generation. This accounted for only 4% of the total construction expen-
ditures; the balance was financed by long-term borrowings (60%), Government
grants and consumer contributions (25%), bank overdrafts and drawdown in
working capital (11%).
4.06      The balance sheets in Table 4.3 indicate that CEB's financial posi-
tion deteriorated considerably from 1972 to 1976 as debt-equity ratio increased
from 46/54 to 51/49 (although this is not bad for an electricity supply under-
taking), current ratio declined from 1.4 to 0.9, and bank overdrafts rose
from MRs 2.4 million to MRs 11.6 million. CEB has overdraft facilities at a
number of the local banks. The financial position at December 31, 1976 is
summarized as follows:

77.8           100.0
Tariffs
4.08      The financial difficulties which CEB encountered in recent years
were mainly due to the inadequacy of the tariff levels and the destruction
of cyclone Gervaise in 1975. In line with the objective of restoring the
financial viability of CEB, the Government and the CEB have agreed that
tariffs should be sufficient to enable CEB to earn a minimum annual re-
turn of 8% on its net operating assets as covenanted under Loan 355-MAS and
that, in addition, the assets would be revalued annually based on the Cost of
Living Index which is published on a current basis in the Government Gazette.
This would enable CEB to generate sufficient funds to make a reasonable con-
tribution to its financing requirements (para. 4.14).



- 31 -
4.09      Current financial estimates indicate that, even  with the 30% tar-
iff increase effective June 1977, CEB will earn a return of only 1.7% for
the year on the basis of revalued assets (paras. 4.10 and 4.18). It has
been agreed that present tariffs will be increased by at least 30% on aver-
age and that they will be adjusted from time to time to enable CEB to return
at least 8% on its annually revalued net operating assets in 1979 and there-
after. The Government and CEB confirmed that the 30% tariff increase will
be implemented as of October 1, 1978. It has been agreed that this tariff
increase will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. With
the new tariff in effect as of October 1, 1978, CEB would earn a return of
4.1% in 1978, but is expected to meet the 8% minimum return requirement in
1979 (para. 4.17).
4.10      The existing tariff structure is not adequately cost-reflected.  The
domestic tariff, which accounts for approximately 40% of the energy sales, is
characterized by a declining block entry charge: the first block of 10 kWh
is priced at Mi 80-86 per unit while all consumption over and above 60 kWh is
priced at Mi 36 per unit. This pricing is highly promotional and neglects
the fact that the additional demand, which is created as a result, would have
to be met essentially from thermal generation which is of ever-increasing
cost. Commercial and industrial consumers generally pay respective flat
rates per unit of Mi 68 and Mi 64. However, if their total connected load
exceeds 15 kW, they would pay respective demand charges of MRs 30 and MRs 25
per KVA of maximum demand and respective running charges of Mi 37 and Mi 35
per unit. Sugar factories, which require standby supply for starting the
factory and for emergency supply during the crop season, would pay a declin-
ing block tariff: the first 20,000 kWh per month is priced at M1 60 per
unit, the next 20,000 kWh per month at Mi 46 and all additional units per
month at Mi 40. As regards the industrial and commercial tariffs, considera-
tion should be given to the introduction of time-of-day tariffs which might
also reflect the pattern of power supply during the year. Irrigation con-
sumers generally pay a declining block tariff during off-peak hours, ranging
from Mi 48 per unit for the first 50 units per month to Ml 30 per unit if
consumption exceeds 100 kWh per month, and a flat rate of Ml 77 per unit dur-
ing peak-hours (evening). This tariff should be further refined to reflect
proper time-of-day and cost of power supply during the year. CEB is conduct-
ing a tariff study based on the long-term marginal costs of power supply. It
has been agreed that this study would be completed and discussed with the
Bank by January 31, 1980 and implemented thereafter.
Revaluation of Assets
4.11      The fixed assets, which are shown in para. 4.06, are stated at his-
torical costs. At end-1976, CEB undertook to prepare a revaluation of these
assets to take account of rising replacement costs. This revaluation, which
was updated during the appraisaL and based on changes in the Average Cost of
Living Index since 1964, concluded that CEB's fixed assets as of December 31,
1976 are as follows when expressed in 1976 prices:

4.12      The above revaluation is satisfactory for the purpose of calcula-
tion of the annual rate of return as mentioned in para. 4.08. This, together
with the methodology for future revaluations, has been confirmed in a supple-
mentary letter to the Loan Agreement.
Financing Plan
4.13      The financing plan for the six-year period 1977 through 1982, which
is extracted from the detailed funds flow projections shown in Table 4.4, is
as follows:
1977-1982

/1   Including expenditures of MRs 7.4 million in 1983.
4.14      The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million equivalent, which would
cover the entire estimated foreign exchange cost of the proposed project,
would provide 11% of the total financing required during 1977-1982. Other
borrowings, which total US$87.6 million including about US$22 million of



- 33 -
local loans (over 90% of which are expected from the Government) and the
balance from external sources (EIB, First National City Bank, Caisse Centrale
de Cooperation Economique, BADEA and others), would account for 64% of the
requirements. The balance of investments, which amounts to US$34.4 million
equivalent (25%), would be met from CEB's internal cash generation. This
financing plan would be acceptable.
4.15      It has been assumed that the Bank loan would carry an interest rate
of 7.45% per annum for 17 years including 4 years of grace.
Future Operations and Financial Position
4.16      The projected Income Statements and Balance Sheets for 1977 through
1985 are shown in Tables 4.5 and 4.6. It should be noted that fixed assets
have been revalued annually based on the Cost of Living Index mentioned in
para. 4.11, which has been assumed to increase by 10% in 1977 and 1978, 9% in
1979, 8% each year from 1980 through 1982. Thereafter, constant 1982 price
terms have been assumed.
4.17      The above projectionis indicate that, with the tariff increase of
30% to be effective October 1, 1978 (para. 4.09) and further respective
nominal increases of 15% and 8% in mid-1980 and 1982, the financial condition
of CEB should improve substantially as evidenced by the following indicators:
% Return on    Operating  Debt Service  Debt/Equity /1  Current

/1   Where equity includes assets revaluation surplus.
4.18      CEB's net internal cash generation is projected to increase from
MRs 6.3 million in 1977 to MRs 53.8 million in 1982 when the proposed proj-
ect is scheduled to be fully completed, which should be sufficient for CEB
to meet its financing contribution stated in para. 4.13.
4.19      In order to ensure that future borrowings by CEB would be commen-
surate with its ability to service debts, it has been agreed that CEB would
not incur any long-term debts unless internal cash generation is at least 1.5
times future debt service including proposed new borrowings.

CHAPTER V
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Technical Justification
5.01      Table 3.1 attached to Chapter 3 shows electricity consumption in
CEB's interconnected system for various classes of consumers over a nlmber
of years. Total consumption has grown at an average rate of 10% for the past
10 years. Table 3.2 attached to Chapter 3 shows forecasts for 1977 through
1986. The following table shows the percentage breakdown of the total energy
used by the various classes of consumers between 1970 and 1985 with 5-year
intervals.
% of Total
1970      1975       1980      1985
Domestic                  42         41         40        38

/I   Including irrigation.
/2   See Table 3.1.
5.02      The forecast in the above table depends on trend analysis modified
conservatively to the extent that after 1979, the forecast growth rate is
less than the long-term trend. No correlation with the growth of GDP or its
components has been attempted due to uncertainties of data accuracy. The
forecast as a whole, however, is reasonable and prudent for transmission
system planning purposes.
5.03      The Project is a part of recommended transmission/distribulcion
facilities to transfer additional electric energy from sources of generation
to load centers. The transmission/distribution program and, where necessary,
segments of the program (the project) are the result of least-cost transmis-
sion/distribution studies based on discounted cash flow analysis and basic
planning procedures. Principal function of each item of the project is given
in Appendix 5.1.
Economic Analysis
5.04      Because of the difficulties in computing the benefits of the items
which make up the project, it has not been possible to calculate a separate



- 41 -
internal rate of return for the Project. The Project, however, forms an in-
tegral part of the transmission/distribution investment program which is the
least-cost solution for meeting the forecast demand. The generation construc-
tion program of CEB however has not been firmed-up and has not been proved
the least-cost generation solution (para. 3.05 through 3.09). The internal
economic rate of return for CEB's total development plan as submitted to the
mission (which includes CEB's proposed generation program) has been assessed
at 18%, where benefits are measured by incremental revenues attributable to
the total investment in the system and financial costs adjusted for taxes and
foreign exchange shadow prices. 1/ Even without the tariff increase of about
30% agreed to take place in October 1978, the rate of return would be about
15%. However, the incremental revenues understate benefits because consumers'
surplus, the improvement in the reliability of electricity supply, and the
reduction in system losses are not taken into account. Furthermore, invest-
ments likely overstate costs because CEB's generation construction program
requires further optimization (paras. 3.07 through 3.10).
Project Risks
5.05      Physical construction of the Project does not pose any significant
risks other than those normally associated with this type of undertaking.
However, there is a risk that financial targets may not be reached if CEB
finds itself unable to implement tariff increases at the times and of the
magnitudes required. If this were to affect the 30% increase decided for
implementation on October 1, 1978, loan effectiveness would be postponed.
1/   Ratio of shadow price to par rate of US$ is 1.10.

switchgear                                      is inadequate so that the ll-kV bus bars have to be operated with bus coupler
open. It is proposed to replace the switchgear by those of higher rating so
as to improve the operation and maintenance facilities of the station.
8.  Erection of 22-kV line between              8.  With the installation of this short 22-kV line, Floreal substation would be fed
ienrietta and Floreal (8 km)                    by an independemt feeder from Henrietta substation in order to improve load
flow and selective fault clearing.
9.  Installation of capacitor banks at          9.  The installation of capacitor banks at F.U.E.L. and Ferney substations would
F.U.E.L. and Ferney                              improve voltage regulation on the long feeders entering the above substations
to St. Louis power plant.
10. St. Louis-Henrietta double circuit         10.  Items 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16:  The works to be implemented under these
66-kV line                                       items would strengthen the transmission facilities from the enlarged

feeders to 66-kV operation to increase the system powel'transportation
capacity to meet the demand.
18. Reconstruction of Poudriere 22-kV          18.  It is proposed to replace the two existing 70 mm2, 22-kV cables feeding
underground feeders                             Poudriere 22/6.6-kV substation by two of higher rating so that one cable
could cater to the full load of the substation under emergency conditions
to provide reasonable reliability in system operation.
19. Installation of a 66/22-kV substation   19 and 20.  Together with the upgrading of the Nicholay road - F.U.E.L. line from
at Belle Vue (2 x 20 MVA)                       22 kV to 66 kV, the 66/22-kV substation at Belle Vue and F.U.E.L. would

at F.U.E.L.                                     increasing load in that region.
21. Erection of 22-kV feeders from Beau        21 and 22.  The installation of a 22/6.6-kV substation at La Louise would allow
Bassin substation to La  Louise                 CEB to relieve Vacoas and Quatre Bornes 22/6.6-kV substations with better

at La Louise                                    increasing load in that region.
23. System control center                      23.  CEB's existing system control center at Curepipe is inadequate for the
system operations of switching, monitoring and load dispatching and for
emergency instructions as well as to monitor system safety. To cope with
the requirement PCR recommends a new center and systematic operations with
adequate instrumentation and telemetering.
24. Extensiorsto CEB's distribution            24.  CEB's distribution system needs extensions to transmit and distribute power
system                                         from transmission system to consumer supply points.  These extensions consist
of many 6.6-kV transformers, switchgears, power lines and customer connections.

CHAPTER VI
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Agreements have been reached with CEB and the Government on the
following principal points:
(a) a comprehensive energy study regarding the use and allo-
cation of energy resources to various sectors would be
carried out by July 1, 1979 (para. 1.07);
(b) an organization and management study of CEB would be completed by
July 1, 1979 and implementation of agreed recommendations would
begin immediately thereafter (para. 2.06);
(c) CEB would submit by April 1, 1979 a proposed training
program to the Bank for review before implementation
(para. 2.11);
(d) CEB's annual accounts would be audited and submitted to
