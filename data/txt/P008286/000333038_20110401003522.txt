1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.    Azerbaijan has made significant progress in reducing poverty. Driven by the oil and gas
boom in Azerbaijan, per capita income rose from US $470 in 1995 to US$1,240 in 2005 and
during 2002-05 poverty fell 22 percent in urban areas outside Baku, and 17 percent in rural areas.
The Government of Azerbaijan (GOA) is using its oil revenues to subsidize development in non-
oil sectors, including agriculture, water resources development, health and education, but since
2000 has initiated reforms to move from state-driven development towards market-driven
development, and to develop the competitiveness of the non-oil economic sectors. Agriculture is
an important component of this development strategy, and a top priority is to develop
agricultural regions and secondary cities and provide basic infrastructure services across the
country, including rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems.
2.    In 2002, agriculture contributed 17 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
Azerbaijan and employment for 40 percent of the population. Ninety six percent of agricultural
output was produced by small-scale farmers on private landholdings. Since most agricultural
land receives only 200 to 400 mm of rainfall, irrigation is essential. However, by 2003, 80
percent of irrigation infrastructure in Azerbaijan was deteriorated and much was near collapse.
Pumps were old and inefficient. Water delivery per ha was high, between 8,000 and 12,000 m3
per ha. The State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) of 2003
stated that Government's two highest priorities were to generate productive employment and
reverse dilapidation of infrastructure. Since most of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure
became seriously deteriorated after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is in need of
rehabilitation and modernization of management, the SPPRED emphasized the importance of
irrigation, investment and cost recovery to rehabilitate and maintain irrigation schemes. It was
also recognized that development of Water Users Associations (WUAs) into effective,
sustainable organizations accountable to members would be a long-term effort. Support services
from the government for WUAs would be needed.
3.    The main emphasis of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2000-02 was
on establishing an appropriate institutional and policy framework, as well as on focusing on
infrastructure development. This was achieved through reform of public sector institutions to
enable them to manage the country's water and other natural resources efficiently and to ensure
that economic growth leads to accelerated poverty reduction. The World Bank's CAS for 2003-
04 emphasized further institutional reforms, capacity building, and infrastructure development
for employment creation and poverty alleviation. The Bank's Rural Development Strategy
(RDS) and Water Resources Management Strategy of 2003, gave priority to improving
productivity and sustainability of water through local management of irrigation. This included
increased participation and empowerment of water users in irrigation, developing WUAs,
investment in rehabilitation, institutional reforms and capacity building. The Irrigation
Distribution System and Management Support Project (IDSMIP) was designed to meet the
objectives of the CAS's and the Water Resources Management Strategy, by strengthening the
performance of irrigation and drainage in order to improve the productivity of agriculture and
generate higher employment and income for poor rural populations.




                                                1
4.    IDSMIP was a high priority at that time for the Government of Azerbaijan, since a number
of significant reforms in the irrigation and drainage (I&D) sector were on-going and in the
process of being adopted. These included: (i) establishment of WUAs at on-farm level after
State and collective farms had been dismantled, (ii) giving WUAs hydraulic instead of
administrative boundaries, (iii) converting WUAs into non-profit entities, independent from local
government and focused only on governance, management and financing irrigation and drainage
at the on-farm level, (iv) setting up an irrigation service fee to cover needs-based budgets at the
WUA level, (v) participatory rehabilitation, and (vi) development of new support services.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.    IDSMIP's development objective was to improve the effectiveness and financial viability
of water distribution and management on 56,000 ha through development of WUAs and the
Amelioration and Irrigation Joint Stock Company (AIOJSC)2. To achieve this, IDSMIP would
support the development of AIOJSC's institutional capacity to enable WUAs to take over
operation and maintenance (O&M) of on-farm irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems, and for
rehabilitating on-farm I&D systems in selected off-farm systems. Given its relatively small area
of intervention and considerable amount of innovation, it should be considered as a pilot project.
6.     Progress was measured against the following key indicators: (i) Collection percentage of
Irrigation Service Fees (ISFs) for WUAs and AIOJSC-managed off-farm O&M activities; (ii)
Amount of maintenance of I&D systems executed by WUAs, as percentage of annual O&M
plans; (iii) Percentage of potential water users who receive irrigation water; (iv) Volume of water
distributed to farm plots, measured as number of irrigations; and (v) Percentage of water users
satisfied with WUA managerial performance, measured with user satisfaction surveys.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators and reasons/justification
7.    There were no formal revisions of the PDO or key indicators for IDSMIP.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.    The primary IDSMIP beneficiaries were small farmers in 11 project raions: Aghjabedik,
Babek, Beylagan, Geranboy, Guba, Imishli, Khachmaz, Saatli, Sabirabad, Sharur and Zardab.
Most of these raions had poverty levels of at least 15 percent. Average landholdings are 2 ha.
Farmers who benefitted the most from IDSMIP improvements in irrigation management were
those whose landholdings are small or are at the tail end or margins of schemes. Farmers on
140,000 ha served by the rehabilitated Bahramtape headworks benefitted because rehabilitation
prevented the potential collapse of the headworks, ensured adequate water abstraction and
produced a 20 percent reduction in sediment load flowing onto these lands. Local governments
were secondary beneficiaries, since WUAs and more productive agriculture will raise the tax
base due to higher income and land values. More equitable water distribution to tail and marginal
areas is likely to reduce water conflicts. Other beneficiaries were WUA officers and staff of the
CSU and 11 Raion Support Units, who were trained to perform their responsibilities effectively.
There are three types of WUAs which benefitted from IDSMIP: (i) rehabilitated WUAs in

 The original Project Appraisal Document refers to the State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC).
During project implementation SAIC was restructured into AIOJSC.

project raions; (ii) non-rehabilitated WUAs in project raions which received intensive training;
and (iii) WUAs in non-project raions that were organized and given basic training.

1.5 Original Components
9.     IDSMIP had three components: (i) Development of Water Users Associations;
(ii) Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure Rehabilitation; and (iii) Project Management.
10. Component 1 -Development of Water Users Associations (US$ 7 million appraisal
estimate, US$ 3.8 million actual) contributed to the project objective of improving the
effectiveness and financial viability of water distribution and management on 56,000 ha through
development of the capacity of WUAs to do effective O&M and to develop the ability of the
Amelioration and Irrigation Joint Stock Company (AIOJSC) to build its capacity to provide
needed support services to WUAs. This was done through two activities.
11. Activity 1 was to develop the capacity of AIOJSC to train and strengthen WUAs. Activity
2 was to strengthen WUAs. To support both of these activities, in 2003 a Central Support Unit
(CSU) was established in Baku and in Nakhchivan, and 11 Raion Support Units (RSUs) in the
project raions. Under Activity 1, office and training equipment, monthly compensation
allowances and operational funds were provided and national and international consultants
recruited to train and build capacity in CSUs and RSUs to establish, train, support and strengthen
WUAs. The CSU was assisted in developing a long-term strategy for WUA development nation-
wide. Skills developed among the initial 7 CSU staff members included: WUA development and
strengthening, public awareness and promotion, training WUA officers and staff, financial
management and setting of Irrigation Service Fee (ISF), monitoring WUA performance and
database/information technology. The CSU in Nakhchivan had 3 staff to coordinate WUA
development in Nakhchivan, in coordination with the CSU in Baku. The RSUs were to have an
engineer, water management specialist and WUA support specialist. Monitoring of WUA
performance required data collection from WUAs and transmission of it to the RSU and CSU.
Activity 1 also included revising the Law on Amelioration and Irrigation which changed WUAs
from for-profit limited liability companies to non-profit associations with limited tax liability and
voluntary membership.
12. Under Activity 2, training programs for WUAs were done in two parts: first, information
dissemination and public awareness to sensitize water users and win support for development of
WUAs, and second, local governments and staff of relevant ministries were made aware of
WUA development. This was done in the early phase of IDSMIP, as was the mapping and
identification of WUA hydraulic boundaries. Training modules were prepared for IDSMIP on
WUA formation and registration; hydraulic boundaries of WUA; WUA organization,
governance and farmer participation; roles and procedures for the WUA Council and Assembly;
WUA administration and roles of staff; preparation of the Irrigation Service Plan, WUA budget
and ISF; collecting and using ISF funds; water distribution; maintenance and repairs;
construction supervision; monitoring and evaluation and preparation of annual reports.
13. The emphasis here is on irrigation management transfer (IMT) to the WUAs with AIOJSC
as the WUA's counterpart. In Azerbaijan, IMT means the transfer of management responsibility
and authority for irrigation systems, at the on-farm system level. It does not mean transfer of
ownership of irrigation infrastructure. IMT builds optimal self-reliance but within a long-lasting
partnership with the government for sector regulation, capacity building and support services



                                                 3
and, in the future, with private sector support service providers. Component 1 also included
provision of supplies and equipment to WUAs, but not heavy equipment.
14. Component 2 Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure Rehabilitation (US$ 30 million
appraisal estimate, US$ 37.4 million actual) supported achievement of the PDO to improve the
effectiveness and financial viability of water distribution and management on 56,000 ha through
participatory rehabilitation for on-farm schemes with 45 WUA. Diagnostic surveys were done in
nine Project raions. They determined that on-farm systems were in very poor condition with high
water losses. Canals had heavy silt loads due to lack of desiltation at headworks. There was little
water regulation or measurement due to lack of hydraulic structures and hydroposts. There was a
lack of incentives for farmers and scheme managers to use water efficiently. Many areas were
salinized and waterlogged. Therefore IDSMIP provided funds for selective rehabilitation of I&D
systems. IDSMIP targeted 280 WUAs in 11 raions, and it was originally estimated that 45
WUAs that reached maturity would benefit from rehabilitation. While the objective of 56,000 ha
remained the same during most of the Project, the number of WUAs selected for rehabilitation
was only 22. Rehabilitation would be mainly at on-farm level with some limited works on off-
farm systems in case these systems hampered on-farm performance. Funding was provided for:
i) rehabilitation of on-farm infrastructure for 56,000 ha (later reduced to 52,000 ha);
ii) rehabilitation of the Bahramtape headworks, which served 140,000 ha in the Imishli, Saatli
and Sabirabad raions that had stability problems requiring urgent attention; and iii) rehabilitation
of important off-farm works. Off-farm rehabilitation and installation of 1,000 hydroposts would
use 35 percent of rehabilitation funds. Most investment was done at the on-farm level.
15. Component 3 Project Management (US$ 2.2 million appraisal estimate, US$ 2.9 million
actual). Given the experience of the PIU in managing the Rehabilitation and Completion of
Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure Project (RIDIP), it was decided that this PIU should also
be the PIU for IDSMIP. It was responsible for daily management, administration and
coordination of IDSMIP. IDSMIP covered staff costs, goods and equipment, operational costs,
costs of M&E, annual audit and the implementation of the Environmental Management and
Monitoring Plan (EMMP).

1.6 Revised Components
16.   The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
17. The State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) changed its' name and structure
to the Amelioration and Irrigation Open Joint Stock Committee, which took over all tasks and
legal responsibilities for IDSMIP from SAIC. No changes were made in IDSMIP's development
objectives or intended outcomes, design or scope and there were no formal revisions of the PDO
or key indicators for IDSMIP. However, instead of 56,000 ha estimated at appraisal, only 52,000
ha could be rehabilitated, as a result o steep price increases in the unit cost of construction
materials. In order to cover short-falls in the rehabilitation budget, it was decided not to
purchase heavy equipment for WUAs, and this was documented in a restructuring paper in
March 2010. Changes made under the restructuring included: (i) extension of IDSMIP closing
date from March 31, 2010 to September 30, 2010; to allow the PIU to finalize and evaluate
IDSMIP, identify lessons learned and incorporate lessons into planning and implementation of
future investments; (ii) exclusion of funding for heavy equipment for WUA; and (iii) adjustment


                                                 4
of credit categories of $2,583,593.25 from goods, training and operations to civil works and
consultancy services. These changes did not affect IDSMIP's objectives, components, indicators
or safeguard rating, nor did they trigger a new safeguard policy.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18. IDSMIP's lending instrument was a Specific Investment Loan. Standard economic,
financial, technical, institutional, environmental, and social assessments were completed during
project preparation, as part of the appraisal process. Preparation took about one year. No Quality
at Entry review was conducted for IDSMIP. General important project preparation factors that
determined implementation performance and achievement of objectives were as follows:
19. Soundness of background analysis: The background analysis during preparation of the
PAD included review of previous Bank experience as well as interviews with key stakeholders,
including farmers. The analysis correctly stated the importance of irrigation and drainage for
agriculture, employment, rural income and needs for development of WUAs for governance,
management and financing irrigation. It rightly identified the need to build capacity in
Government to provide support services and the importance of participatory rehabilitation. The
PAD correctly noted the following key challenges: need for legislative reform for WUAs,
ineffective WUAs, lack of O&M at on-farm level, insufficient funds for O&M, need for a new
ISF based on needs basis, need for better collection rates, inequitable and unreliable access to
water by farmers. Each of these led to development of WUAs that are capable of performing
their essential functions and Government that is capable of providing needed support services to
the WUA. Measured improvements in all of the above challenges have been made where all
aspects of IDSMIP have been implemented. However, the need for close linkages between
irrigation and agriculture sectors, as stated in the PAD, has not yet been achieved. Confidence
expressed in the PAD about adequacy of economic, financial, institutional, social (including
gender), environmental and stakeholder aspects to permit development of functional WUAs
proved to be well grounded during implementation.
20. Assessment of project design: IDSMIP was kept simple by: (i) having a limited scope that
focused on improving O&M and financial viability of irrigation; (ii) having only two main
components, institutional development and rehabilitation; and (iii) intervening mainly at the on-
farm level. This facilitated focus on key challenges and lessons learned. IDSMIP was committed
to enabling new WUAs to handle all essential roles of on-farm system governance, management
of O&M, financing WUA costs and participatory rehabilitation. This comprehensive treatment of
WUA development is often not done in other countries. IDSMIP promoted changing WUAs
boundaries to hydraulic ones that take on non-profit status with a focus on I&D scheme
management, providing a sound basis for focussed management. IDSMIP was a follow-on from
the Farm Privatization Project (FPP) and RIDIP project. WUA support for rehabilitation was
piloted under FPP. Rehabilitation of main and inter-farm I&D structures was supported under
RIDIP. These experiences developed capacity of consultants, contractors and the PIU to
implement IDSMIP satisfactorily. It was recognized by the Government that rehabilitation would
be a non-sustainable investment if it were not followed by adequate maintenance. IDSMIP
played an important role in creating awareness among farmers that O&M is the responsibility of
water users and that the central and local governments should not interfere with the internal
business of the WUA. All these aspects of project design were based on lessons from experience


                                                5
inside and outside of Azerbaijan and they were emphasized in implementation and led to
favourable project outcomes.
21. Adequacy of government commitment: The Government, primarily through the Cabinet of
Ministers (COM) and AIOJSC, showed strong and sustained commitment to reforms carried out
before and during IDSMIP. These have been dramatic and extensive. (See section 1.1 for a
summary.) The PIU had prior experience from RIDIP and was able to quickly take over
responsibility for daily IDSMIP management, administration and coordination. IDSMIP enabled
the CSU and RSU to begin a long-term, multi-faceted program of capacity building and support
services for WUAs. This included management consultations between RSU and WUA.
22. Assessment of risks: The PAD identified the risk of failure of WUAs to raise sufficient
funds to cover full O&M through an irrigation service fee. This concern is still relevant but
project implementation has shown that where all interventions are made, including rehabilitation,
both the ISF and the collection rate rise substantially, especially where agriculture is more
profitable. It is still not clear to what extent the Government will adequately fund O&M at the
main scheme level. Implementation has shown no occurrence of interference with the WUA by
central, regional or local governments. Cost overruns during the Project did occur in the form of
hyper inflation in the cost of construction materials, but this was dealt with by reducing the area
for rehabilitation by a modest amount (from 56,000 to 52,000 ha). Risks of shortage of
competent staff proved unfounded, as did the risk of inability of finding competent contractors
for rehabilitation. There was no assessment of Quality at Entry but this proved not to be a
problem.
23. IDSMIP consisted of several innovations that were essential for achievement of positive
results. This is the case with the amended Law on Amelioration and Irrigation within its
requirements for re-registration of WUAs as a non-profit legal entity with hydraulic boundaries.
This, together with extensive capacity building of AIOJSC and WUAs, and the continuing
support from the Government for all these reforms, initially delayed the onset of rehabilitation
but enabled genuine participatory rehabilitation and approvals to occur, which created a sense of
ownership for the schemes and project amongst farmers.
24. A number of I&D rehabilitation features formulated during project preparation were
important factors for subsequent performance and results attained. These were: (i) eligibility
criteria and selection of WUAs for rehabilitation aimed to ensure future sustainability;
(ii) allocation of up to 35% of rehabilitation funding for off-farm works; (iii) an investment level
of $300 USD per ha for on-farm rehabilitation; (iv) participatory rehabilitation and 10%
repayment by farmers of rehabilitation costs; (v) re-introduction of volumetric water
measurement; and (vi) design and construction supervision services through consulting
engineers. In addition, the PIU consisted primarily of staff who were already experienced from
working with the RIDIP and were able to implement IDSMIP effectively according to World
Bank procedures, such as Bank procurement.
2.2 Implementation
25. More detailed information about implementation and outcomes can be found in Annex 2.
The core factor during implementation was the focus on WUA capacity building before
investments in rehabilitation. Although the early focus on WUA development caused delays in
on-farm rehabilitation, early attention to WUA formation provided the basis for effective
participatory rehabilitation and successful achievement of the PDO.


                                                 6
26.    The following are key achievements in implementing Component 1.
      IDSMIP funded a public information campaign and WUA promotion meetings. These
      created understandings about the approach for WUA development. A key message was that
      irrigation problems are farmers' problems and farmers must be part of the solutions. The
      campaign used awareness meetings, radio broadcasts, newspaper articles, posters, brochures,
      and a newsletter. (See Annex 2 for details.) Sensitizing meetings were held at neighborhood
      level and WUA Awareness workshops were held about the WUA statute, organizational
      structure and re-registration. These were highly effective in generating support for WUA
      development and the independence of WUAs from local government.
      As a result of project support for implementing the LAI, 470 WUAs have been re-registered
      and over 50 more are ready for registration. This constitutes an irrigated area of 1,240,303 ha,
      which is 94% of total irrigated area in Azerbaijan. Within IDSMIP raions 207 WUAs have
      been established and re-registered. Under IDSMIP CSU staff were trained, prepared training
      material, provided training to RSU, monitored work of RSU and gave them on-the-job
      training. RSU staff were trained to provide training to WUAs and assist them with
      restructuring WUAs and re-registration. Four Community Mobilization Specialists helped
      WUAs re-register under the amended LAI, to restructure, change their boundaries and
      membership and become more participatory. These were effective and were appreciated by
      the RSU. Over the life of IDSMIP, WUAs were formed, developed and supported by RSUs.
      Provision of support by the RSUs was halted from March 2010 onwards, leaving WUAs with
      still under-developed technical, financial and organizational abilities. WUAs still need
      support from the RSU. Although project WUAs are not yet fully managed and financed,
      especially non-rehabilitated ones, they are on a path toward sustainable financing and
      management, especially rehabilitated WUAs.
      During implementation it was realized that a long-term, multi-faceted program of capacity
      building for WUA, which included management consultations between RSUs and WUAs,
      was essential. The emphasis on capacity building enabled the RSU to become capable and
      oriented toward identifying and providing support services for WUA. However, it is not
      clear whether the Government will provide sufficient, long-term funding for this. During
      implementation it was decided that, to be effective, RSUs in project raions needed offices
      with a training room, computer, printer, furniture, telephone/fax machine, photocopier,
      overhead projector and small generator.
      It was recommended by review missions that the CSU should enhance its support to RSUs
      and WUAs through more regular field visits and a more hands-on management style. A
      training needs assessment identified the need for the following courses under IDSMIP:
      establishment of WUA, promotion and training, O&M plan, financial management,
      rehabilitation, governance and administration, and M&E. Training modules were prepared
      and training was provided for CSU, RSU, and WUA officers, staff and members. RSU staff
      implemented WUA Training Programs in each raion. By 2008 all training was completed.
      Due to the strong desire of the client to observe positive experiences with irrigation in other
      countries, in 2007 three study tours went to Egypt and Turkey with staff of the AIOJSC, CSU,
      RSU and WUA. They observed irrigation management transfer, WUA federations,
      development of ISF and irrigation sector reform. This brought about a substantial boost in
      enthusiasm and support for reforms.




                                                   7
27.    The following are key achievements of implementation of Component 2.
      Eligibility criteria to select WUAs included WUA development status, technical readiness,
      past performance and commitment. A minimum economic rate of return of 12% was
      specified. This ensured that only WUAs capable of maintain the rehabilitated system were
      targeted for rehabilitation. The main focus was on-farm improvement but 35% of funds were
      used for off-farm works. The condition of off-farm works was mostly sound. The average
      rehabilitation cost average of USD 300 per ha was set to benefit the greatest possible number
      of WUAs. Farmer participation continued through planning, design and construction. At
      IDSMIP completion the large majority of farmers were satisfied with results.
      The Bahramtape rehabilitation used a larger-than-planned portion of rehabilitation funds due
      to cost inflation, insufficient pre-project assessment and late inclusion into IDSMIP.
      However, Bahramtape structures withstood a major flood in June 2010 that probably would
      have caused its collapse had it not been rehabilitated.
      Engineering firms were used for Project design and construction supervision, one for on-farm
      rehabilitation and one for the Bahramtape headworks rehabilitation. Designs were found
      appropriate and cost effective; construction supervision ensured quality construction; and
      final drawings and documentation were at a high standard. Due to previous experience and
      contract supervision, most contractors have been capable and have performed well. The few
      exceptions were limited by judicious project management and supportive interventions.
      Regarding rehabilitation, after the designs were completed and reviewed by the May 2007
      IDA review mission, several opportunities for rehabilitation cost savings were identified
      which reduced the per hectare costs. The Mid-Term Review Mission expressed concern over
      the variable quality of construction work in the field and the quality of contract management
      and supervision. The following items were recommended: adequate staffing among
      supervising consultants must be ensured, more proper procedures for contract management
      and site supervision were needed, a more rigid review of contractors' inputs and outputs
      should be done, more suitable equipment for the excavation of canals would be used by
      contractors, more appropriate canal lining jointing techniques would be employed and
      hydraulic structures would be constructed fully in accordance with specifications and proper
      construction techniques. The PIU agreed to review staffing and capacities of supervising
      consultants and request changes as necessary to ensure appropriate supervision and training
      of site supervisors.
      It was indicated in the IDSMIP PAD that, as a conditionality for financing on-farm
      rehabilitation, volumetric water measurement was to be reintroduced. 1,000 water
      measurement structures (hydroposts) were installed at key WUA/RID interface locations
      around the country.
28. Component 3 was the work of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU Director
had responsibility for overall implementation of IDSMIP and was assisted by the Project
Manager who supervised IDSMIP staff and reported to the PIU director. The Engineering Team
guided and supervised engineering works, including contract management and construction
supervision. The Environmental Specialist coordinated implementation of the Environmental
Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP). Procurement, financial management and accounting
staff worked together. The M&E Specialist oversaw M&E and prepared baseline, benchmark and
final reports that were reviewed and discussed by IDSMIP leadership. The PIU did financial
management, recruited consultants, purchased supplies, goods and equipment, paid for some


                                                  8
operating costs, financed and oversaw M&E, managed the environmental monitoring plan and
financed and made contracts with auditing firms. Auditing was done by certified audit firms, and
all audits found satisfactory accounts and financial statements.
29. Key factors affecting implementation included the following. The most important factor
affecting successful project implementation has been the support of the Government for the
reform program and capacity building of the AIOJSC and WUAs. It should be noted that prior
experience of PIU members, consultants and contractors with Bank irrigation sector projects in
Azerbaijan was an important factor in successful implementation of rehabilitation that started
late but caught up before the end of the project.
30. Review missions found several ways to improve the efficiency and quality of rehabilitation.
However, volatile inflation led to a reduced rehabilitated area, increased development costs, and
cancellation of WUA heavy equipment. Despite this IDSMIP targets were still largely met.
Project fund reallocations for the last 6 months of IDSMIP forced cancellation of heavy
equipment for WUAs. But WUAs have indicated that in the absence of excavators and/or a
backhoe they are unable to clean canals of vegetative growth and sediment. There was no
Supervision Assessment in addition to review missions but this did not appear to affect the
Project unfavourably.
31. Successful implementation of IDSMIP depended on issuance of the revised LAI in 2004
and issuances of 7 subsequent supporting regulations over the following 2 years. Although this
delayed start-up of rehabilitation, it greatly facilitated participatory rehabilitation that pursued in
a timely fashion thereafter.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32. M&E under IDSMIP had two purposes: i) develop and use a database on WUA inventories
and performance and ii) assess progress toward achievement of the PDO.
33. M&E Design: M&E was designed mainly as information gathering from individual and
group interviews in the baseline and end-of-project survey. A total of 27 indicators were used
which provided data on implementation, immediate outcomes and ultimate impacts, including all
indicators for the PDO, output and outcome indicators shown in the Results Framework
Analysis. Indicators of implementation included establishment of WUA, capacity building,
planning and implementation of O&M, setting, collecting and using the irrigation service fee,
holding of awareness meetings, and participatory rehabilitation. These all affected the outcome
indicators. Outcome indicators included the quality of the irrigation service according to farmers,
including water distribution equity, timeliness and reliability, collection of the ISF, and approval
of WUAs with rehabilitation. It also included reasons for any dissatisfaction. Impact indicators
included crop yields and livestock productivity (related to production of fodder crops). M&E had
three main weaknesses: 1) It started rather late, with a baseline survey done only at the end of
2006, 2) It relied only on interviews and no collection of data through water measurement or
observations and 3) There has been too little time to assess impacts.
34. M&E Implementation: Data was collected from individual farmers mainly by the RSUs
and was assembled in the CSU. Group interviews were done mainly by the M&E Specialist of
the PMU. M&E was done as a baseline survey in 2006/2007 through a specialized company.
(More information on baseline and end-of-project surveys can be found in Annex 5.)



                                                  9
35. M&E Utilization: Results from the M&E surveys were reported in a timely manner and
discussed in meetings with the AIOJSC, PMU and Bank. Findings provided support for such
actions as adding WUA Community Mobilization Specialists, identifying needs for WUAs and
RSU capacity building, and needs to enhance participatory rehabilitation. It is expected that in
the future findings from the M&E will be used by the State Supervisory Body (SSB) after it
becomes operational.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
36. Social safeguards: No social safeguard procedures were identified during appraisal.
However, social analyses and appraisal identified five key social issues that were determined to
be potentially benefitted by IDSMIP. These were poverty, empowerment, equity, gender and
social inclusion. It was expected that poverty would be reduced through intensification of
agriculture, expansion of irrigated land and more employment. IDSMIP was expected to create
more income for the poor through more equitable water distribution to tail-end areas. It was
decided at appraisal to ensure that women were to be involved in information campaigns and
WUA assemblies. The gender study found that respondents perceive that women have better
skills than men in conflict resolution, awareness raising, accounting and communication. No
adverse social impacts were identified during project implementation. The objective for IDSMIP
to improve the effectiveness and financial viability of irrigation water distribution and
management was achieved through strengthening WUAs and rehabilitation of on-farm schemes.
37. Environmental safeguards: Environmental impact assessments were done for rehabilitation
works for IDSMIP and for works done under RIDIP. Under RIPDI the Main Mil-Mughan
collector was extended to the Upper Garabagh collector via crossing the Araz River, which
would stop water flow from the south and southwest to Sarisu Lake and Aghgol Lake. The river
was broadened, the river bank was consolidated, silt was removed from the headwork settling
basin, the fish ladder was rehabilitated and electric and mechanical parts of the headwork were
repaired. Quality of surface and ground water was monitored and no negative results were found.
Environmental monitoring of the Aghgol and Sarisu Lakes found that construction / extension of
the Main Mil-Mughan Collector did not disrupt the environmental integrity of the lakes nor did it
cause negative impacts. Reconstruction of this collector-drainage network affected 36,500 ha and
led to improving the conditions of soils, including lowering of groundwater and mineralization.
Monitoring at the Bahramtepe Headwork and related WUAs showed that rehabilitation did not
cause negative environmental impact, nor was the mineralization ratio affected. Rehabilitation
improved water supply and soil productivity. Assessments found that groundwater levels and
mineralization went down in several areas after off-farm rehabilitation. Drainage system
improvements reduced waterlogging and salinity.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38. The following are key factors expected to affect post-project attainment of benefits and
formulation of a successor project, based on lessons learned from IDSMIP.
   Investments in on-farm irrigation and drainage are now largely sustained by the WUAs.
   These WUAs have made great advances in management and financial capacity, but will need
   continued support.
   Because of the importance of capacity building and support services provided by the CSU
   and RSUs, it is expected that the CSU and RSUs will become long-term entities. Budgets


                                               10
    need to be provided by AIOJSC for supplemental income to RSU for their extra work.
    Continuing support by RSUs to WUAs is needed for sustainability of on-farm I&D systems
    and attainment of high agricultural output.
    RID and WUAs enter into water supply contracts annually. For WUAs that had rehabilitation,
    provision of agreed services and payment of ISFs are generally occurring satisfactorily.
    However, long-term contracts for water supply (10 years) and extended use agreements for
    on-farm infrastructure (20 years) have not yet been adopted for WUAs other than
    rehabilitated WUAs. Agreements between the government and WUAs should define water
    supply services and payments, O&M responsibilities and obligations, and financing and
    support arrangements.
    WUAs with rehabilitated on-farm systems are collecting increased fees from members.
    Amounts cover bulk water supplies (currently standardized at 0.5 AZN (=0.63 USD) per
    1,000 m3) and provide for WUA fixed costs (salaries and expenses) and on-farm system
    maintenance. There is a high variation in amounts charged by WUAs. The beneficiary survey
    highlighted that charges vary between 5 AZN/ha (in low value agricultural areas, especially
    in the south) and 50 AZN/ha, with the higher WUA ISF occurring in areas with high value
    orchards and vegetables in the north. The amount collected ranges from about 25% of actual
    needs for O&M to nearly 100% of requirement (the latter being achieved mainly in the more
    agriculturally profitable north). The rate paid to the RID for bulk water supply equates to a
    small fraction of actual cost of water delivery and main system O&M. But until the present,
    the Government has been reluctant to raise this charge. 3
    The agreed WUA contribution to rehabilitation is 10% of total cost, with a low fixed interest
    rate and five-year grace period. WUAs have agreed to repay the 10%, on top of the ISF.
    Farmers have the view that the easy terms of repayment mean that: (i) rehabilitation was
    mostly a gift, (ii) system ownership will remain with government, and (iii) government will
    assist with large-scale on-farm system maintenance. Repayment has not yet begun but it
    would be helpful for the Government to clarify to farmers its commitment to repayment. It
    should also be clarified to farmers that RIDs will not provide on-farm system maintenance
    for irrigation canals, but it will for drainage networks.
    After rehabilitation the net margins were $1,549/ha in the Northern Region, $1,140/ha in the
    Central Region, and $1533/ha in the Nakchivan Region. It has been estimated that the
    average level needed for the WUA ISF to cover all O&M, fixed costs and a repayment rate
    for rehabilitation of 10% would be approximately $45.66 per ha. This would constitute only
    3% of the net margin per ha in the Northern and Nakchivan regions and 4% in the Central
    Region. By international standards, these are on the low to medium side of average cost of
    irrigation relative to net margins.
    All WUAs and RIDs in IDSMIP areas agree that each WUA needs one excavator and/or
    backhoe. Provision of such equipment under a future project should be considered4. WUAs
    have expressed willingness to pay a share of costs for this on the same basis as for works. It
    is suggested that because these equipment are moveable and depreciable assets, an effort


3
  "ISF" refers to the charge by RID for bulk water supply. "WUA ISF" refers to the charge to the farmers by the
WUA that includes payment for both the water supply and WUA fixed and variable costs.
4
  The requested basic small excavator/backhoe equipment would probably be appropriate for those WUA systems
with predominantly earth irrigation canals and small section open drains. A prior system-by-system assessment of
equipment needs and suitability is warranted.


                                                        11
   should be made to obtain a higher cost recovery than that for rehabilitation. This could be
   higher recovery (50%), down payment of 10%, and shorter repayment schedule. It may be
   necessary to provide a pilot number of WUAs with excavators to see whether they will
   maintain and repay them.
   Continuing support by RSUs to WUAs for on-the-job training and management consultations
   is essential for the long-term in order to ensure sustainability of on-farm I&D systems and
   attainment of high agricultural output. But it is not clear that there is sufficient support in the
   government to ensure budgets for the CSU and RSUs.
   In addition to support services, WUAs will also only become strong and sustainable if the
   economic productivity of agriculture increases through changes in crops, better cultivation
   practices, value-added crop processing and access to good markets. This will require a
   significant role for the MOA. Without improvements in the value and stability of irrigated
   agriculture and more open, democratic decision-making, WUAs will be weak.
39. The Government of Azerbaijan has requested additional support from the World Bank for a
nation-wide project for I&D development, referred to as the Water Users Association
Development Support Project (WUAP). It will be based on the IDSMIP approach. WUAP will
have the same objectives and components as IDSMIP, with an emphasis on achieving on-farm
system financial viability and improved management. It is expected that WUAP will expand the
capacity building to approximately 27 raions and 379 WUAs, for an irrigated area of about
950,000 ha, and will target around 85,000 ha for rehabilitation. The WUAP will be supervised
and implemented by the same PIU that was responsible for IDSMIP. The CSU and RSUs will be
needed in 27 raions. To meet the expanded coverage, 4 regional support centers will be
established with staff paid by the WUAP.
40. The AIOJSC will coordinate this national irrigation and drainage program. The State
Supervisory Board will regulate the sector. The AIOJSC, through the RID, will continue to
manage O&M of main and large secondary canals (the off-farm canal systems). WUAs will
manage on-farm schemes but in the future they are expected to federate along secondary canals.
Support services will be provided to WUAs through the RSUs and future regional support
centers. Given the experience obtained through IDSMIP, local capacity to implement WUAP
will be much greater than at the beginning of IDSMIP and improvements under IDSMIP provide
a vision and motivation for others.
41. It will be necessary to revise the organization of M&E and the set of indicators used to
enable more comprehensive and timely availability of findings. M&E should be done less
through large numbers of farmers and more through a smaller group of selected informants,
through water measurement and observations. It should include assessment of inputs,
implementation, outcomes and impacts and these should be related, through monitoring to
utilization, in the form of tracking identification of problems and making improvements during
implementation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
42. The original objectives of IDSMIP to achieve effective management and financial viability
of I&D systems through development of effective WUA, SAIC/AIOJSC and CSU/RSU is still


                                                 12
highly relevant, as the results of IDSMIP demonstrate. Project experience and assessment of
outcomes confirms that the project design was appropriately focused on building the capacity of
WUAs to function effectively and building the capacity of AIOJSC through the CSU and RSU to
provide support services to WUAs will enable a long-term functioning of capacity building. The
emphasis of project design on on-farm rehabilitation for new WUAs that met selection criteria
provided substantial benefits to these WUAs in terms of irrigation management performance and
crop yields. This will provide incentives for future WUAs to qualify for rehabilitation. The draft
World Bank Strategy Note for the Irrigation Sector indicated that there are around 900,000 ha in
Azerbaijan which still require rehabilitation. The relevance of effective WUAs in managing
irrigation systems effectively was confirmed by IDSMIPs experience in organizing WUAs and
achieving improvements in management performance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
43. The PDO were aimed at improving the effectiveness and financial viability of irrigation
distribution and management on 56,000 ha, for both WUA development and on-farm
rehabilitation. Project interventions extended beyond this. Interventions were completed on
52,000 ha (93% of target area) and institutional and infrastructure development ensured that
irrigation management effectiveness and financial viability substantially improved. This is a
satisfactory achievement of the PDO. There was an increase in the total amount of water
supplied, better planning of water delivery, and reduced water losses. While the amount of water
supplied to non-rehabilitated WUAs remained relatively constant over 2006-09, beneficiary
WUAs witnessed an increase in water supplied by over 40 percent. Capacity building of AIOJSC
and WUAs resulted in satisfactory achievement of all expected outcomes--although it is
apparent that capacity building needs to continue for the long term.
44. WUAs benefitting from completed I&D rehabilitation are performing well: 82% of water
users have increased their number of irrigations and 78% of all water users are satisfied with the
performance of WUA. These WUAs increased their ISF by 3 to 5 times, with a collection rate of
around 80%, thus enabling them to conduct most of the planned O&M of rehabilitated systems.
Farmers are willing to pay higher ISFs as water supply services improve. There is more
confidence that higher agricultural production can be achieved with a guaranteed water supply
and better water distribution. There are productivity gains resulting from increased numbers of
irrigations and more timely water supply. Farmer incomes have increased as a result of switching
to more lucrative crops and bringing fallow land under production. These results are
encouraging, and since most rehabilitated schemes were finalized in 2009, the 2010 cropping
season is expected to show significant improvement after rehabilitation is completed.
45. Key results for Project Development Objectives are summarized with the following: (i) ISF
and collection rates increased significantly in rehabilitated schemes; (ii) budgets of rehabilitated
WUAs increased four-fold; (iii) rehabilitation of 53,000 ha in 22 WUAs in 11 raions with an
average cost for on-farm rehabilitation of $450 USD/ha5; (iv) 101 km off-farm irrigation canals,
1,112 km on-farm irrigation canals, 5 km off-farm drains and 537 km of on-farm drains were
rehabilitated, which was 90% of the target (shortfall due to inflation); (v) 23% average increases
in crop yields; (vi) increases in area irrigated and reduction of uncultivated land from


5 The $450 USD per ha is only for on-farm irrigation rehabilitation and does not include rehabilitation of the
Bahramtepe Headworks.


                                                         13
approximately 10,500 ha in 2006 to 2,300 ha in 2009-2010; and (vii) changes in cropping
patterns to more lucrative crops like vegetables and orchards. Although 2010 was only the third
season after rehabilitation, results so far suggest that IDSMIP will reach its development
objectives. The main role the PIU played in ensuring satisfactory outcomes was through timely
and effective mobilization and disbursement of funds for awareness and training events, goods,
equipment and technical experts.

3.3 Efficiency
46. IDSMIP obtained the following results in terms of performance efficiency: (i) rehabilitation
had ENPV of US$46 million and an EIRR of 32.1%; (ii) economic returns for rehabilitation of
I&D were 25% and for Bahramtepe headwork were 39%; (iii) IDSMIP overall had ENPV of
US$963/ha and EIRR of 32.9%; and (iv) financial internal rate of return was 28%.
47. Several factors contributed to differences in economic and financial results of the appraisal
and current analyses. These include improvements in assumed and actual rehabilitated area, crop
yields, cropping pattern improvements, and areas returned to production. Although the first three
factors contributed to differences in Project benefits, higher economic and financial results
produced by the analysis are mainly attributable to the significant difference between predicted
and actual area that returned to production (5,600 ha vs.10,500 ha).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
48. This rating of satisfactory is justified on the basis of successful establishment of WUAs in
Project raions and elsewhere in the country, successful rehabilitation on 52,000 ha, development
and adoption of an appropriate legal and institutional framework for the sector, significant
increases in area irrigated, improvement in crop yields, increased area irrigated and shifts to
more profitable crops in several areas. Economic and financial rates of return were satisfactory.
Minor shortcomings included the significant cost overruns, mainly for Bahramtepe Headworks,
and the subsequent reduction in funding for equipment for WUAs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
49. IDSMIP had the following effects on poverty, gender opportunities, equity and social
inclusion.
   Poverty: IDSMIP provided economic opportunities for smallholder, marginal or landless
   farmers through intensification of agriculture, expansion of irrigated areas and increase in
   employment. Improved irrigation enabled agricultural growth and increased rural income. In
   Project raions crop yield levels increased 23%, improving livelihoods and reducing poverty.
   This resulted in increased ISF levels, collection rates and improved income for farmers. More
   improvements, including employment, occurred in the Northern and Central Regions where
   high-value crops are more prevalent, but improvements in fodder production also helped
   farmers improve income in the Southern Region.
   Equity: While farm privatization distributed land relatively equitably, differences in access
   to water led to inequitable opportunities and income. Social diagnosis during appraisal found
   that new WUAs were headed by former kolkhoz heads in more than 90% of the cases.


                                               14
   IDSMIP promoted election of WUA heads, open discussions and decision making in WUA
   Assemblies. One indication of emerging democratic conditions is that in at least two cases
   WUA members have ousted WUA heads for malfeasance of duty.
   Gender: IDSMIP included women and men in awareness and information campaigns to
   ensure that all benefitted from IDSMIP. Special gender events were organized in some raions.
   Women were invited to meetings, training, and assemblies. Women who met WUA
   mobilization specialists or received training had better understanding about the importance of
   women participating in WUAs. Women have irrigation water needs for their home gardens
   on their household plots. This topic will deserve further attention in the follow-up WUAP.
   Social inclusion: In general, social development of WUAs has taken place, with increased
   participation of farmers in WUA operation, maintenance and decision making. Prior
   inequities alienated people from decision making about water. IDSMIP helped overcome this
   by participatory rehabilitation, disseminating information about the amended LAI and rights
   of WUA members, election of representatives, participation in Assemblies and actions by
   WUA leaders to reduce economic differences related to inequitable access to water.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
50. IDSMIP developed awareness and support for participatory irrigation management through
WUA. Substantial training and management consultations were given to WUAs to enable them
to know how to adopt appropriate and participatory practices for WUA governance, O&M,
effective financial management and development of ISF and budgets. Given the Government's
commitment to providing long-term support to WUAs there is reason for optimism that the
WUAs will continue to develop. The Government intends to develop self-reliant WUAs with
empowerment and technical capacity to function effectively. IDSMIP restructured WUAs
through the amended LAI in a way that enabled them to become autonomous, be more
representative of water users, be trained, competent, and transparent. Long-term contracts
between WUAs and AIOJSC provided a stable way for WUAs to rely on a dependable water
supply. Capacity building of WUAs was a key component of IDSMIP. IDSMIP WUAs began to
have more revenues and better financial and irrigation management. They are still dependent on
RIDs and RSUs. The amount of funds collected from the WUA ISF of rehabilitated WUAs
increased by more than 4 times and these WUAs are now able to do O&M reasonably well,
though not yet fully. Non-rehabilitated WUAs have not been able to raise sufficient fees for
O&M work. In the long run it will be essential for the MOA to become more effective in
enabling farmers to produce more productive yields per unit of water for crops that are more
profitable than wheat and other low value crops.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
51. Survey reports show positive social impacts of IDSMIP. Improved water provision for
irrigation in rehabilitated WUAs led to fewer conflicts over water. Due to a shortage in the
IDSMIP budget, heavy-duty maintenance equipment and motorcycles were cancelled. Farmers
and WUAs complained about lack of equipment that led to insufficient maintenance work by
WUAs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshop
52. In August 2009 a beneficiary survey collected information from IDSMIP raions on the
performance of newly established WUAs, quality of irrigation services, reasons for any


                                              15
dissatisfaction, and crop and livestock productivity in project and non-project WUA. It was
found that project WUAs prepared service plans as they had been trained, water supplies doubled
and farmers in rehabilitated WUAs received 4 irrigations, cultivated area increased 25%, crop
yields increased 17.7 to 23%, ISF increased 3 to 5 times to 81% collections, budgets of
rehabilitated WUAs increased 4.4 times, 78% of farmers were satisfied with irrigation services,
and a large majority of WUA members stated that they are willing to pay more for the ISF if they
get better services.
53. The Stakeholder Workshop on 23 September 2010 discussed experiences and lessons
learned from IDSMIP and recommendations for future development of I&D. At the workshop 81
participants attended, including representatives of 44 WUA. Four topics were discussed. The
first topic was benefits of rehabilitation and expansion. Key recommendations were: deal better
with inflation of costs of rehabilitation, do not rehabilitate during cultivation season, provide
more training and financial, legal and technical support for WUA, install more water
measurement devices and revise water supply norms. Topic 2 was the need of WUAs for
excavators, tractors, motor vehicles, motorcycles and offices. Participants recommended
provision of equipment to WUAs with agreeable terms of cost sharing. Topic 3 was about
priorities for support services and training. Topic 4 was a summary of recommendations, which
were: needs assessment for each WUA, involve WUAs in project design and planning, give
rehabilitation contracts to WUA, build more I&D facilities, one WUA should manage one
hydraulic unit, build self reliance in WUAs, and rehabilitate many more on-farm systems.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
54. The risk that IDSMIP's development outcomes would not be sustained was considered
moderate. The development of WUAs enabled them to have organizational, decision-making and
implementation arrangements for operations, maintenance, and management so that water users
would be able to achieve their agricultural potential. For WUAs that had rehabilitation, main
constraints to effective and equitable water management were removed. Results included not
only improved water security and reliability and lower operating costs, but also increased yields,
more high-value cropping, greater cultivated areas, etc.
55. Risks to sustainability lie with the under-developed technical, organizational and financial
capabilities of WUAs. It is not certain that support services would be available to WUAs in the
long term. The inadequacy of equipment like excavators and back hoes and WUA dependence
on the government is a concern. Government funding is available for O&M of off-farm systems.
It appears that RID/RSU are willing to provide support to WUAs as long as they have resources.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
56. The Bank provided sufficient resources during IDSMIP preparation to enable diagnostic
surveys to identify issues and options. The Bank ensured that works proposed in the appraisal
and loan agreement were aligned with government priorities. The studies facilitated Project



                                               16
preparation and identified needs for improvement works. IDSMIP was seen to be a series of pilot
interventions and procedures. There was a need for a large-scale follow-up project. Many other
I&D systems have severe and urgent needs for rehabilitation that can only become productive
and sustainable with effective WUAs. Institutional development of WUAs is a long-term need.
Further support is needed to ensure that WUAs in Azerbaijan can become technically and
financially sustainable and can operate and maintain their systems. No changes were made to
Project objectives, components and activities. Small changes occurred in design of civil works.
Bank performance in Quality at Entry can be rated Satisfactory. Planned outcomes were
achieved consistent with the Bank's fiduciary role. This was done while introducing innovations.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
57. A total of 16 supervision missions, including a mid-term supervision mission, were
provided by the Bank. These missions were effective and timely in addressing issues arising.
Missions identified problems that could have jeopardized achievement of PDOs and resulted in
cost over-runs and sub-standard results. Practical recommendations were made. Aide memoires
prepared at the end of each mission were informative and clear. They identified issues that
needed to be addressed before the next mission. Supervision missions were sympathetic to both
problems faced by the PIU and obstacles faced by international TA teams. Where substandard
performance occurred the Bank dealt with them in a realistic and fair manner, some of which
resulted in replacement of international staff. The Bank's supervision performance is rated by the
Borrower as highly satisfactory. Back-up support provided by the Task Team and the Bank
Country Office on implementation was highly appreciated by the PIU. Minor shortcomings
included a decrease in the comprehensiveness of supervision towards the end of IDSMIP.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
58. Introduction of this innovative approach in Azerbaijan required careful diagnosis and
planning during appraisal. This was done effectively as indicated by small changes in approach
or component activities required during implementation. Appropriate expertise was mobilized as
needed. Supervision missions were effective in providing guidance and timely adjustments.
Good working relationships were maintained throughout IDSMIP.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
59. The AIOJSC has been highly supportive of IDSMIP. The Government provided
counterpart funding and support whenever required, consistent with amounts identified during
appraisal. They found offices and training rooms for the RSU. Senior officers and staff have
always been readily available to discuss issues with Bank staff and consultants during their
missions. They have repeatedly helped teams of international consultants work in Azerbaijan and
have assisted to overcome obstacles in their work. The AIOJSC helped the PIU establish
working relationships with the Cabinet of Ministers (COM), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Economic Development, State Land Committee, Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources, and others. It should also be noted that the AIOJSC and COM have been willing to
adopt into Law and practice several innovations in IDSMIP, such as the alternative concept of


                                               17
the WUA as a non-profit voluntary legal entity, participatory governance and management of the
WUA, the design of the ISF, and so on. The Government was both flexible and quick to act on
facilitating adoption of changes. However, there were weaknesses in capacities and performance
of the CSU and RSU that still need to be overcome and the SSB has yet to be established.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
60. The PIU was fully committed to planning, supervision and implementation of IDSMIP at a
high standard. It was also well integrated with AIOJSC. It implemented IDSMIP satisfactorily.
Financial management, procurement, supervision and M&E functions by the PIU were all
considered satisfactory. The PIU managed suitable financial, accounting and reporting systems
that provided adequate and timely information for implementation and review.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
61. The performance of AIOJSC and the PIU are considered satisfactory in their capability,
commitment and wise actions taken during IDSMIP. This is especially so given the steep
learning curve that the AIOJSC and PIU went through in order to adopt several technical
innovations and new Bank procedures, such as procurement and monitoring. The end-of-project
survey indicated that water users indicated high satisfaction with IDSMIP.

6. Lessons Learned
General lessons
 Project concepts and structure were simple but relevant. The focus on institutional
  development and rehabilitation appropriately concentrated on the essential core aspect of
  irrigation that needed urgent development. Simplicity and focus prevented risks of over-reach
  and distraction. Objectives were straightforward and not too ambitious. This was a pattern
  built in from the start of IDSMIP. This is a lesson with relevance beyond IDSMIP and
  Azerbaijan.
 IDSMIP has demonstrated that combining institutional development, capacity building and
  rehabilitation is an important combination in Azerbaijan, and elsewhere. Clearly,
  rehabilitated WUAs perform much better than non-rehabilitated WUAs. Rehabilitated WUAs
  have much higher WUA ISFs than non-rehabilitation ones. They carried out 91% of the
  maintenance in their O&M plans, distributed water to 100% of their members, their members
  had an average of 4 irrigations per summer season (which is twice that of non-rehabilitated
  schemes), and 78% of users were satisfied with O&M (which is much higher than non-
  rehabilitated WUA).
Lessons from Component 1
 WUA promotion and information campaign and WUA annual conferences were successful in
   generating support. Arrangements should be made for WUA staff to visit successful WUAs
   to learn from them. Successful WUAs are the best sources of ideas and inspiration for other
   WUA. Study tours and training are essential to create vision and support for reforms.
   Introducing WUA leaders to international practices makes them willing to make changes.
   Development of WUAs to where they can function as democratic, self-reliant organizations
   requires long-term commitment and support from government.


                                              18
   The relationship between the WUA, regional/local offices of the AIOJSC and RSU will be
   long term and should become a partnership of support. Assistance should not create
   dependency but should be designed to move WUAs toward greater self reliance.
   The commitment of the Government to irrigation sector reform was realized in timely
   passage of the LAI, re-establishment of WUAs, adopting WUA ISF based on local costs,
   management transfer, provision of support services and setting up of a regulatory body (SSB).
   These were and are all essential reforms to enable WUAs to become sustainable. In the future
   these will develop into effective local management and self-financing of on-farm schemes,
   available support services for WUA, and regulation of the sector. The Ministry of
   Agriculture needs to play a more prominent role in providing support services to farmers for
   high-value crop choices, value added crop processing and marketing.
   Initial delays were caused in project implementation because of lack of experience in
   preparing legal documents. More training for RSUs and WUA officers in preparing
   documents for WUA re-registration, water supply agreements, transfer agreements, etc. at the
   beginning of the next project could help avoid such delays.
   IDSMIP indicates that WUAs need thorough training and management consultations to
   enable them to have good Irrigation Service Plans, which is also relevant internationally.
   High priority should be given to designing the ISF to cover full cost of O&M in each on-farm
   scheme. In the future this should include area-based and volumetric charging (AZN/1000m3).
   The former would cover full fixed costs of the WUA and the latter would cover costs of
   water deliveries. Penalties should be applied for non-payment of the ISF.
   The main factor for WUAs achieving sustainability lies in quality of management, operation,
   repair and maintenance by the WUA. Investment in rehabilitation and institutional
   development are mutually supportive.
   IDSMIP appropriately prepared a disbursement schedule recognizing that WUA capacity
   building takes a long time but that a significant amount of it had to be done before
   participatory rehabilitation could be implemented effectively. This was factored into the
   disbursement schedule correctly.
Lessons from Component 2
 Repeated use of experts is necessary to ensure quality, cost effectiveness and timeliness of
   implementation. Continuity and management benefits come from use of same consultants for
   design and construction supervision. By adopting this approach enhanced project
   implementation and efficiency have been achieved.
Lessons from Component 3
 A project with as many new aspects for Azerbaijan as IDSMIP should provide early training
   for PIU staff. Such training should include institutional issues, methods for implementing a
   complex project with many contracts, planning participatory rehabilitation with ongoing
   intensive irrigation, procurement, and so on.
 Although prices have stabilized by the end of IDSMIP, there is a need for the PIU to find
   better ways to plan projects to better deal with unforeseeable cost increases, such as through
   larger contingency budgets, access to supplemental funds, etc.
 It is essential to have regular and detailed supervision in the field. Capable and informed PIU
   staff supervision and high quality supervision through Bank missions were essential for
   satisfactory implementation. Right skills for supervision are also essential.



                                               19
      It was learned in IDSMIP that the disbursement schedule for rehabilitation could be delayed
      appropriately to enable adoption of institutional reforms first.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

General
1.   Over the first half of the project period (2004 to 2006), implementation progress as
measured by effected loan disbursements was poor. However, progress with low-cost but high-
impact legal and WUA institutional development was favorable. During this time designs and
tender documents for rehabilitation contracts (including Bahramtape headworks) were
completed. The mid-term review was done in 2007, at which time all initial works contracts were
ongoing and no project changes were seen to be warranted.
2.    The PDO concerned improving the effectiveness and financial viability of irrigation
distribution and management on 5,600 ha, the area projected for both WUA development and on-
farm rehabilitation. However, Project interventions in both institutional development and system
rehabilitation extended well beyond this. The PDO interventions were substantially completed on
52,000 ha (93% of the target area) and quantity and quality of institutional and physical
infrastructure developments have been such that irrigation management effectiveness and
financial viability have been substantially improved. Overall this is seen to be a satisfactory
achievement of the PDO. Project achievements as reflected by the indicators are shown in the
tables below for Annex 2. The following is a description of key outputs achieved during
implementation, by component.

Component 1
3.   Legal changes. Successful implementation of IDSMIP depended on initial issuance of the
Amended Law on Amelioration and Irrigation and eight subsequent documents. The amended
LAI was signed into law by the President in June 2004. This was followed by issuance also in
2004 of the following five documents:
       Model WUA Statutes (for WUAs with a General Assembly or Representative Assembly);
       Long-term Water Supply Agreement (10 years);
       Annual Water Supply Contract;
       Long-term System Transfer Agreement (20 years);
       System Inventory Act.
4.    In April 2006 the new Azerbaijan Republic Tariff Council was established and made able
to issue the resolution for the new ISF. The Volumetric Water Agreement redefined the Water
Tariff or ISF from an area-based to a volumetric charge (AZM/m3).
5.    Regulation and State Supervisory Body. The amended LAI stated that there should be a
State Supervisory Body (SSB) established and that its procedures should be developed. Soon
after the amended LAI was issued in 2004 the President issued a subsequent decree that the
AIOJSC should take responsibility for the SSB functions. The AIOJSC then delegated these
functions to the CSU and RSUs to provide regulatory oversight for the WUA. The international
Legal Specialist and WUA Development Specialist of the World Bank stated that it was a
conflict of interest to have regulatory / supervisory functions given to the entities responsible for
implementing WUA support and development. Subsequently the Chairman of the AIOJSC
issued an order in 2006 stating that state supervision of WUAs should be done by the Operation
of Irrigation Systems Department. There has been a significant delay in establishment of the
SSB, which is still pending.


                                                 22
6.     Re-registration and capacity building of WUAs. RSUs began to re-register WUAs after the
first training course on WUA formation in 2005. 470 WUAs have been re-registered and over 50
more are ready for registration. This constitutes an irrigated area of 1,240,303 ha, which is 94%
of the total estimated irrigated area in Azerbaijan. The average service area of one WUA is 2,134
ha. The average number of members per WUA is nearly 1,000. Within Project raions the total
number of WUAs are 208 and by the end of 2009 100% of these had been re-registered. Each of
these have had their capacity built up to where they have the ability to manage themselves within
the framework of an ongoing partnership for support. The AIOJSC conducted an assessment that
found that one-third of the WUAs were highly effective and one-third were functioning
satisfactorily. The remaining one-third were in need of significant further support to improve
their capabilities.
7.    Training of CSU staff. CSU staff were trained in every topic and training method that were
given for other training. But most training for CSU staff was on-the-job training in the form of
their involvement in preparing training material for all the modules, delivering training courses
to RSU staff and visiting RSU staff to monitor their work and give them on-the-job training as
well. However, all of the CSU staff were engineers and none had knowledge or experience with
financial management, so a national financial consultant was contracted to providing training on
financial management, including preparation of three training modules on the subject. The course
on Promotion and Training was about methods and skills for promoting and providing training in
WUA development and was attended by all CSU and RSU staff. Training was also given to CSU
and RSU staff in computer skills, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Some staff were also
trained in use of ArcGIS software for mapping.
8.    Training of RSU staff. This training-of-trainers prepared RSU staff to train WUAs and to
assist them in the following tasks:
       Restructuring (including changing to hydraulic boundaries and a new set of members),
       Re-registration in accordance with the amended LAI,
       Formation of the WUA,
       Provide formal training courses to the WUA officers, technical staff and some members,
       Provide guidance through repeating consultations with WUAs.
9.    Provision of office space, equipment and supplies. RSUs in the project raions were each
allocated an office space and training room for WUA training. Each was provided a computer
and printer, furniture, telephone/fax machine, photocopier, overhead projector and small
generator. They were also allocated use of a car and staff were given a supplemental allowance
for their extra work under IDSMIP.
10. Approach for training. Training under IDSMIP included identification of training needs,
preparation of training modules and material and provision of training for the CSU and RSU
staff and WUA officers, staff and members. This was done in a step-wise manner that included
training of trainers and training of WUAs. The pattern was that the TA team trained CSU staff.
Then CSU staff (sometimes with assistance from the TA) then trained RSU staff. Then the RSU
staff trained WUA representatives.
11. Training needs assessment. A comprehensive training needs assessment (TNA) was
conducted by the TA expert and CSU for CSU and RSU staff and for WUA officers, staff and
members. It involved a rapid assessment of existing backgrounds, knowledge and skills of SU
staff in comparison with knowledge and skills required for developing WUA. The TNA used


                                               23
questionnaires, individual and group interviews and information from the CSU database to
identify irrigation-related topics needed for training as well as the topic of training methods. The
following courses were developed and provided.
   a. WUA establishment RSU were given training in WUA formation, including re-
      registration, new concepts about WUAs from the amended LAI, WUA establishment,
      WUA statutes, hydraulic WUA boundaries, inventory of irrigation assets, and preparing a
      transfer agreement.
   b. Promotion and Training CSU and RSU were trained in training methods and skills.
   c. Annual Operation and Maintenance Plan This course was for CSU, RSU and WUA staff.
      It was about how to prepare annual WUA work plans with approval by the WUA
      Assembly.
   d. Course on financial management This 3-part course was for CSU, RSU and WUA staff.
      It covered making budgets, setting and collecting the ISF, making expenditures,
      bookkeeping, financial reporting and auditing. Four Regional Financial Specialists were
      recruited, trained and directed to provide all financial management training needed for
      the WUA.
   e. Course on Construction and Rehabilitation This course included modules on design and
      tendering procedures, contract management and supervision of construction, as well as
      modules to train WUA officers and staff for WUAs selected for rehabilitation.
   f. Course on Governance and Administration The objective of this course was to train RSU
      staff to train WUA officers and staff in how to govern the WUA (leading meetings,
      elections, dispute resolution) and how to administer (including taking minutes, making
      reports, etc.).
   g. Course on Monitoring and Evaluation The international M&E specialist prepared and
      gave a training course on 2006 for CSU and RSU staff in how to select indicators,
      identify methods for data collection and processing, prepare M&E reports and how to use
      M&E findings.
12. WUA Training Program. RSU staff developed and implemented WUA Training Programs
(WTP) in each of their raions. By the end of 2006 all project raions had prepared and submitted
to the CSU their WTP. Six months after this 75% of the training was completed. Training was
also given to 42 other non-project raions on the amended LAI and financial management. The
capacity building of SAIC (now AIOJSC) and WUAs has resulted in satisfactory achievement of
all expected outcomes, although it is apparent that capacity building needs to continue for the
long term.
13. Study Tours. During 2007 three study tours were conducted for AIOJSC officials, staff of
CSU and RSU and WUA chairmen. The first involved 14 AIOJSC officers who went to Egypt to
learn about irrigation management transfer (IMT), federation of WUA, efficient use of water and
relatively high productivity of irrigation water. The second tour involved 11 participants (RSU
staff, WUA chairmen, CSU staff and PIU Project Manager) who went to Turkey to observe IMT
and ability of WUAs to have ISF that covered all costs of O&M. The third tour was again to
Turkey to examine the process of reform by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works
(DSI) and WUA.
14. Four Community Mobilization Specialists. Four Community Mobilization Specialists were
mobilized by the Project to help WUAs re-register under the amended LAI, to restructure,
change their boundaries and membership and become more participatory. The Specialists were


                                                24
appreciated by the RSU because they increased the pace and correctness of mobilizing water
users, establishing and registering WUAs.
15. Inventories of WUA infrastructure. After RSUs and WUA staff received training in how to
conduct inventories of the functional condition of WUA I&D infrastructure, they did I&D
inventories during 2006 and completed them for all re-registered project WUAs.
16. Promotion program. The Project's promotion program consisted of a public information
campaign and WUA promotion meetings. The main focus group consisted of farmers, women
heads of farm families, community elders and marginal farmers. The second focus group was
policy and decision makers in government concerned with irrigated agriculture. The purpose of
the promotion program was to create understanding about the rationale and approach for WUA
development. A key theme conveyed was that irrigation problems are farmers' problems and
farmers must become part of the solution.
17. Public information campaign. The campaign used radio, audio cassettes, television,
videos, posters, brochures, newspaper articles and newsletters, as follows:
       Awareness meetings: In 2004 the CSU organized several public awareness activities
       including a meeting in Baku attended by 50 staff of AIOJSC and four regional seminars;
       Radio broadcasts: Repeating radio broadcasts began in November 2005 and continued
       until 2010 in the amount of an average of 30 minutes broadcasting per month;
       Newspaper articles: From early 2006 22 articles were published in 25 different
       newspapers;
       Posters: In 2005 3 posters were distributed to the RSUs. These were posters on: (i) the 3
       components of the IDSMIP, (ii) steps in formation of the WUA and (iii) the new
       organizational structure established by the amended LAI;
       Brochures: These were prepared on the following topics: (i) structure of the WUA in
       accordance with the newly amended LAI and Water Code, (ii) information about the
       objectives, components and activities of IDSMIP, (iii) text of the amended LAI, (iv) text
       of the WUA statute and (v) water distribution by the WUA.
       Newsletter: The newsletter has been published quarterly since 2007 and contains regular
       news about WUA development and current issues. These have been highly appreciated
       by WUA members and RSU staff.
18. WUA promotion meetings. There have been three types of meetings conducted under
IDSMIP. These are Roundtable Meetings, Sensitizing Meetings and WUA Awareness
workshops. The Roundtable Meeting was held in each Project raion where information on WUA
development was conveyed by RSU staff to government officers and public and feedback and
suggestions were received. The Raion Awareness Meetings contributed greatly to generating
local support for WUAs. Many municipalities made office space available for WUAs.
Sensitizing Meetings were held at the neighborhood level with farmers and other villagers to
have informal discussions about WUAs, to develop a communication network among water
users and to plan developing WUAs based on popular support. WUA Awareness Workshops
were organized by RSU staff to provide more detailed awareness among prospective WUA
members about the new WUA statute, organizational structure of the WUA and re-registration
procedure.




                                               25
19. Strong attention to WUA formation. The early and heavy focus given to establishment and
development of WUAs had the effect of delaying on-farm infrastructure rehabilitation. This had
been foreseen in Project planning, but delays were substantially increased due to slow early
progress in Component 1. However, once commenced, participatory design and rehabilitation
proceeded well, such that completion was achieved as scheduled. The strong attention to WUA
formation has provided a good basis for future advancement of needed on-farm rehabilitation.
20. Towards self reliance in financing irrigation. The Project developed much higher
Irrigation Service Fees (ISFs) and better collection rates. The project has significantly improved
WUAs' recovery of management, operation and maintenance (MOM) costs for the irrigation and
drainage infrastructure. In the north region, WUA ISFs increased in the 2008/9 irrigation season
from AZN 0.5/1,00m3 to AZN 6.0 /1,000 m3 with close to 100 percent collection rates as the
project enhanced farmers' capacity to pay for irrigation services. WUAs have more revenues,
better financial and irrigation management, and depend less on the Raion Irrigation Departments.
Over years 2006-09, budgets of the rehabilitated WUAs increased by more than 4 times reaching
on average AZN 12,000 per year), compared to AZN 7,400 for non-rehabilitated WUAs. In
2009, the rehabilitated WUAs had carried out 91 percent of the O&M works agreed in their
plans. In contrast, one third of the non-rehabilitated WUAs have not done any O&M work at all,
heavily depending on Raion Irrigation Departments to carry out such work.

Component 2
21. Factors that specifically affected outputs of irrigation and drainage infrastructure system
rehabilitation are discussed below:
 a. Selection of WUAs for on-farm rehabilitation. As defined at appraisal, the eligibility
    criteria to be applied to select WUAs for which subsidized system rehabilitation works
    would be undertaken considered the WUA's status of development, technical readiness,
    past performance and future commitment. A minimum acceptable economic rate of return
    of 12% was also specified. All of these were aimed at ensuring long-term sustainability. It
    was also intended that there should be a uniform distribution of WUAs between various
    project raions.
 b. Restricted funding for off-farm rehabilitation. Since the Project focus was on-farm
    institutional and physical improvements, the restriction of 35% of the amount of available
    rehabilitation funding for off-farm works was justified. It was found in Project areas that
    the functional condition of off-farm works was mostly sound. This was due partly to
    preceding interventions under RIDIP and other projects and partly due to timely repair and
    maintenance works by Raion Irrigation Departments (RIDs).
 c. Rehabilitation of Bahramtape headworks. Conversely, the Bahramtape headworks
    rehabilitation, the project's major off-farm system intervention, eventually consumed a
    larger-than-planned portion of the rehabilitation funds. This was because of cost escalations,
    insufficient pre-project assessments and late insertion of this item into the Project.
    However, the value of the Bahramtape intervention was well seen when in 2010 it safely
    withstood a major flood that reportedly would have caused its collapse before its
    rehabilitation. The Project also provided water measurement structures (hydroposts) at key
    WUA/RID interface locations.
 d. Indicated average rehabilitation investment level. The average cost average of USD 300
    per ha that was indicated in the PAD, to cover reinstatement of on-farm systems to


                                               26
     operational norms, was set with a view to benefiting the greatest possible number of WUAs.
     It is considered that application during implementation of this initial guideline value, or of
     a subsequently increased value, as a cost ceiling level may have been unduly rigid or severe,
     resulting sometimes in important rehabilitation works not being undertaken. The need for a
     specified maximum (rather than average) cutoff unit area cost, to help keep costs at a
     reasonable level, is recognized.
e.   Participatory rehabilitation planning and design. In general there was comprehensive
     farmer consultation, participation and involvement throughout the rehabilitation planning,
     design and construction process. At project completion there appears to be almost universal
     farmer satisfaction with the processes and results.
f.   Re-introduction of volumetric water measurement. It was indicated in the IDSMIP PAD
     that, as a conditionality for financing on-farm rehabilitation, volumetric water measurement
     was to be reintroduced. 1,000 water measurement structures (hydroposts) were installed at
     key WUA/RID interface locations around the country, not only for the few systems that
     were rehabilitated. Indications have been given that some hydroposts may not always have
     been well located, well constructed and/or properly placed into service, mainly those
     outside of rehabilitated systems.
g.   Design and construction supervision consultants. An engineering consulting firm was
     engaged for Project design and construction supervision services, one for the WUA
     systems rehabilitation works and one for the Bahramtape headworks rehabilitation. There
     were some early difficulties in quality of services, but these were corrected and the overall
     end result was good. Final designs were appropriate and cost effective; construction
     supervision ensured quality construction; and final drawings and documentation were up to
     a high standard. Supervision is seen to have been sound.
h.   Fund reallocations. Project fund reallocations for the last 6 months of the Project period
     forced cancellation of procurement of heavy-duty O&M equipment for WUAs with
     rehabilitated on-farm systems. WUAs communicated that, in the absence of access to small
     excavator/backhoe equipment, they are very constrained in their ability to remove
     vegetative growth and sediment. Many Project areas are affected by rapid growth of
     vegetation in watercourses. Because of heavy floods in main rivers in June 2010, sediment
     loads were very large. Although manual operations to remove vegetation and sediments
     had been done seasonally or more often, the scope of the task was such that keeping works
     handed over to the WUA in functional condition could not be achieved without basic
     machinery, mainly excavators.
i.   Abbreviated support to WUAs. Over the life of the Project, WUAs were formed,
     developed and supported by Raion Support Units (RSUs). For most of the WUAs with
     rehabilitated systems, provision of support by the RSU stopped after rehabilitation was
     completed. WUAs with still under-developed technical, organizational and financial
     capabilities were largely left to themselves in performing new post-rehabilitation
     management responsibilities. This is a risk to the sustainability of WUAs since they need
     periodic capacity building for the long term future.
j.   Rehabilitation of on-farm schemes. Rehabilitation of the on-farm irrigation systems
     managed by the selected WUAs was done for 22 WUAs serving 52,000 ha at a cost of
     $21.8 million USD. Specified irrigation and drainage infrastructure rehabilitation target
     outputs included 340 km of rehabilitated off-farm and 1,800 km of on-farm irrigation
     canals, for a total of 2,140 km. Achieved outputs were 1,225 km for irrigation rehabilitation,


                                               27
     or 60% of target. Target rehabilitated off-farm and on-farm drainage channels were 340 km
     + 550 km, respectively, for a total of 890 km. Actual output achieved for drainage channels
     was 542 km, which was also about 60% of target. Under-achievement in rehabilitation of
     irrigation and drainage canals was largely due to original over-estimation of the needs for
     off-farm system rehabilitation. Target area rehabilitated and working with adequate
     irrigation or drainage services was 5,600 ha. The actual amount achieved was 5,200 ha,
     which was over 90% of the target. The small shortfall was due to escalation of construction
     costs. Responsibility for O&M and use rights for up to 20 years was transferred to 22
     project WUAs in July 2005.
22. Outputs of rehabilitation. The Project rehabilitated some 53,000 ha of service area in 22
WUAs in 11 raions. Cost of on-farm rehabilitation averaged about US$ 450/ha. Incremental
benefits include:
       a. Average increases in yields due to improved irrigation water distribution to farmers of
          23% for all crops;
       b. Increases in area irrigated and a subsequent reduction of uncultivated land from
          approximately 10,500 ha in 2006 to 2,300 ha in 2009-2010;
       c. Change in cropping patterns to more lucrative cash crops like vegetables and
          orchards;
       d. With efficient on-farm irrigation management, beneficiary WUAs will likely see their
          yields continue to increase over the next 20 years, corresponding to an estimated
          annual income increase of about US $70/ha for wheat and barley, US $300/ha for
          vegetables and US $130/ha for orchards.
23. Outputs of rehabilitation of Bahramtape headworks. Rehabilitation and modernization of
the major diversion and irrigation water intake structure, the Bahramtepe Headworks, on the
Araz River was completed in July 2009. It has withstood recent flooding and it has a financially
viable and technically experienced management in place. The analysis predicted that the overall
project would generate a financial rate of return at 21 % and the same rate of economic return.
The results of individual analyses suggested that the economic returns to the investments in the
irrigation and drainage infrastructure and the Bahramtepe headwork were around 25% and 39%,
respectively. Evidence of the sustainability of the improved Bahramtepe headworks will take
time, but it was encouraging to note that the Bahramtepe Headwork was able to withstand the
peak flows in the Araz River during the May/June 2010 floods.
24. Outputs to Outcomes. These outputs were linked to specified outcomes relating to (i)
number of potential water users who actually receive irrigation water (95% of all potential water
users in each WUA with a rehabilitated system), and (ii) volumes of water distributed to the farm
plots (4 irrigations for summer crops for 80% of all farmers in WUAs with rehabilitated
systems). The achieved outputs were sufficient to produce good estimated results for the first
outcome (93% of water users), 98% of target, and for the second outcome (4 or more irrigations
for summer crops for 96% of farmers), over 120% of target.
25. Changes in water supply. There was an increase in the total amount of water supplied,
better planning of water delivery, and reduced water losses. While the amount of water supplied
to non-rehabilitated WUAs remained relatively constant over 2006-09, beneficiary WUAs
witnessed an increase in water supplied by over 40 percent.

26. Irrigation and drainage system works undertaken under Component 2 covered
(i) rehabilitation of on-farm irrigation and drainage infrastructure systems serving about 5,200 ha
for 22 selected WUAs in 11 raions; (ii) rehabilitation of the Bahramtape headworks on the Araz
river, which supplies irrigation water to an area of about 140,000 ha including 89,000 ha in 3 of
the project raions; (iii) rehabilitation of other off-farm infrastructure systems as needed to ensure
sufficient and timely water delivery and service to the above-indicated on-farm systems; and
(iv) provision or reinstatement of 979 water measurement structures (hydroposts) in 46 raions, to
enable volumetric measurement of bulk irrigation water flows at WUA/RID interface locations
across much of the country. The works were undertaken under a total of 23 works contracts, of
which one, for the Bahramtape headworks rehabilitation was procured using international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures and the rest were procured using national competitive
bidding (NCB) procedures6. Corresponding design and construction supervision was undertaken
under 2 consultancy services contracts procured using quantity- and cost-based selection
(QCBS).
27. Out of a total Component 2 investment of 37 million USD, 90% (33 million USD) was for
the various on-farm and off-farm rehabilitation works while 10% (4 million USD) was for the
corresponding design and construction supervision services. It also shows that, of the total
Component 2 investment value, the Bahramtape headworks rehabilitation accounted for 34% and
other off-farm works rehabilitation including hydroposts accounted for 9%. The on-farm works
rehabilitation accounted for the remaining 57% of the total Component 2 investment value.
28. Rehabilitation works contract costs totaled 33.4 million USD, of which 11.6 million USD
were for the Bahramtape headworks contract and 21.8 million USD were for the 22 WUAs'
system contracts. Of this latter amount, 1.3 million USD was for the provision of hydroposts
country- wide; the remaining 20.5 million USD was for WUA-specific rehabilitation of on- and
off-farm systems. Over the total corresponding service area of 52,000 ha, this was equivalent to
an average unit WUA system rehabilitation cost of 395 USD/ha, of which 9% was the off-farm
works portion.
29. It is noted that WUA system contracts were let in 5 successive batches of 4 or 5 contracts
each. The progression of unit rehabilitation costs, and of off-farm works portions, over 3
relatively distinct implementation phases is summarized in the table below. The indications from
site and office discussions are that, after a first phase (batch 1) in which incurred costs were
significantly higher than the value of 300 USD/ha indicated in the PAD, successful efforts were
made to reduce costs in a second phase (batches 2 and 3) by reducing the scope of the
interventions, particularly for the off-farm systems. The cost increases of the third phase
(batches 4 and 5) would have resulted primarily from general price escalation but would also
have reflected some more comprehensive addressing of on-farm works deficiencies. The
indications are that some of the contracts of the second phase in particular (batches 2 and 3) may
not have attended to all of the important water management constraints, mostly drainage system
deficiencies.



6
  Due to the larger than projected WUA areas and a perceived sufficiency of national contractors, the upper
threshold for procurement of contracts for WUA systems rehabilitation works under NCB procedures was increased
from 600,000 to 2,000,000 USD per contract in year 3 of the project, at about the time of preparations for the first
such contracts.


                                                        29
30. Out of the 1,225 km of irrigation canals and 542 km of drainage channels that were
rehabilitated, 57% (702 km) and 91% (493 km) respectively were open earth type, for which
rehabilitation primarily consisted of cleaning (vegetation removal) and restoring (excavation of
sediments and reforming of sections). For the remaining lengths, additional works included
selective repairs or provision of in-situ concrete linings, pre-cast concrete canalette sections and
pipeline networks. Perhaps the most significant system water management and physical
durability improvements would have been those resulting from the repair or provision of 4,239
structures including water control structures (e.g. canal intakes, head regulators, cross regulators,
gated outlets) and water passage structures (e.g. culverts, flumes, bridges). Finally, the 979
hydroposts, put in place at key water measurement locations for both rehabilitated and non-
rehabilitated systems, should also make a major contribution to enhancement of future
operational sustainability of the systems.
31. The effected works have resulted in confirmed water management improvements of great
importance to system users and operators. Positive impacts reported included the following:
          Reduced water-logging and soil salinity,
          Lower groundwater levels,
          Greater irrigation water supply reliability,
          Increased physical and operational efficiency (lower water losses leading to water
          savings), (v) increased water distribution control, equity and flexibility, and
          Consequent corresponding financial savings, cultivated area reclamations and
          expansions, and higher and more secure levels of agricultural production and income.
32. However, an important concern arising from evaluation visits to system rehabilitation sites
relates to the potential for sustainability. Less than half of the schemes, and a very small number
of locations within each scheme, were visited. After a year or two of post-rehabilitation
operations, the types and numbers of perceived deficiencies were small but still seemingly
significant considering the small sample of visited sites. These deficiencies were judged to be
mostly a consequence of shortcomings not in works design or construction but in systems
management, operational knowledge and practices, and physical care and maintenance. They
point to a need for continuing relevant technical, managerial, social and institutional support to
WUAs. Some example noted deficiencies include:
33.      Heavily weeded and overgrown previously cleared earth canals and drains
          Sediment and trash accumulations at new flow control structures
          Some broken new outlet gates in need of repair
          Excessive flows and submergence at provided hydropost structures (which may have an
          element of design and/or construction shortcomings), and other possible indications of
          sometimes infrequent use of hydroposts
          Improper operation at some locations of the long-crested overflow weir and gated water
          level control structures (leaving the gate open and increasing flows to raise water levels
          instead of closing the gate and allowing for design weir overflows).
34. The later solution was to prevent sediment buildup at the structure and hence to reduce the
scope and effort of later sediment removal operations, but it could also generate hydraulic
damage to outlet structures and downstream earth canals.
35.      Improper localized physical interventions to solve local problems included the following:


                                                  30
       Retrofitted raised weir crest to achieve higher irrigation water levels, leading to local area
       flooding and risk of structure failure (instead of serving the higher land from an upstream
       outlet location);
       Broken irrigation canal banks to divert excess flows to local drainage, again leading to
       localized flooding plus probably prejudicing water supplies to downstream areas (instead
       of adjusting canal inflows or distributions or rotations); and
       Broken canal banks and makeshift canal diversions to bypass provided control and outlet
       structures, jeopardizing system integrity and control, and generating flood and water loss
       problems, all to resolve various local problems that would have more technically correct
       and less disruptive and degenerating solutions.
36. Some leakage through the Bahramtape headworks downstream dividing wall at high water
level (an item reportedly repaired under the rehabilitation works contract). Beyond this, it is
noted that recent major Kura and Araz river floods have impacted rehabilitated schemes in
Sabirabad raion (and possibly elsewhere). The reported damages include:
       Complete scheme inundation in one instance,
       Drainage systems backflow blockages,
       Lost or damaged intake pumping station, head distribution basin and structures, and
       supply canal, in one scheme, and
       Severe canal flow disruptions and sediment loads.
37. It is understood that special government funding has been allocated to effect flood damage
repairs. It may prove desirable to properly assess the damaged systems during preparation of a
successor project, with a possible view to assisting with needed repairs under such a project if
warranted. At the Bahramtape headworks it was seen that the main trash racks had been badly
distorted and damaged by tree trunks and debris carried by the flood, that heavy tree and trash
loads had blocked the sediment tanks and other parts of the complex, and that downstream bank
protection works had been damaged locally by water seepage from an adjacent flooded canal.
However, the regional AIOJSC agency operators were immensely pleased at the overall good
performance of the rehabilitated structure during the flood.
38. Finally, the WUA system rehabilitation works as a whole have, after one or two post-
rehabilitation seasons, reportedly generated some substantial irrigated agriculture benefits. The
key indicators of presumed impact of system rehabilitation works on irrigated agriculture
include: (i) yields for the four major project area crop groups, (ii) areas under high value
cropping (fruit and vegetables), and (iii) overall cultivated area. Indicator values from 2006 (pre-
rehabilitation) and 2009 (post-rehabilitation) surveys are compared in terms of percentage
increase from 2006 to 2009. For the overall area served by the 22 rehabilitated WUA systems,
the average indicator value increases from 2006 to 2009 are in the range of from 13% to 39%;
the latter highest increase value is for high value cropping. These results, which were
qualitatively confirmed by farmers at the visited schemes, are considered to be most pleasing.
39. Tables A2.1 and A2.2 below summarize key costs and contract details for on-farm and off-
farm rehabilitation. Table A2.3 summarizes key information about key infrastructure works
quantities for WUA/on-farm rehabilitation and Table A2.4 summarizes information about key
impacts of rehabilitation.

All of the hydroposts were provided under a total of 14 out the 22 WUA infrastructure rehabilitation contracts, as shown in the table. However, they were
physically placed at key WUA/RID interface locations not only for the 22 WUAs but also for all WUAs in the 11 project area raions and for WUAs in 35
additional raions across the country. Thus the numbers of hydroposts shown in the table for each WUA reflect contract provisions but not physical

Component 3
40. Implementation and supervision arrangements for IDSMIP were similar to those of RIDIP.
The PIU supervised, managed and coordinated the Project. The PIU conducted financial
management, recruited all consultants, purchased Project supplies, goods and equipment, paid
for part of the operating costs, financed and oversaw monitoring and evaluation, managed
implementation of the environmental monitoring plan and financed and made contracts with
annual auditing firms. Annual auditing was done starting with Price Waterhouse Coopers in
2004, followed by Deloitte & Touche, LLC, Azerbaijan and Moore Stephens Azerbaijan. All
these audits concluded an unqualified opinion of satisfactory accounts and financial statements.
41. Procurement. Procurement was done in accordance with the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines under IBRD loans and IDA credits, which were new and rather demanding relative to
conventional procurement practices in Azerbaijan. The Project's first component included
purchasing of vehicles, office equipment, furniture and small equipment for WUAs. Procurement
of technical assistance for consulting services was done through the Quality- and Cost-Based
Selection (QCBS) method. The second component was for I&D infrastructure rehabilitation that
consisted of consulting assistance and civil works, which was rehabilitation of off-farm
infrastructure, (such as headworks, main and secondary I&D canals, hydraulic control structures,
on-farm canals and structures and hydroposts. Except for rehabilitation and modernization of the
Bahramtepe Headworks, for which procurement was done by ICB, all the rest of component 2
was done through National Competitive Bidding (NCB). All other forms of procurement
followed Bank procedures.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis for IDSMIP

Introduction
1.    The purpose of this analysis was to re-evaluate the financial and economic impacts of the
Irrigation Distribution System and Management Improvement Project (IDSMIP) completed in
2010. The project cost was estimated at US$39.1 million during appraisal and was completed for
US$43.3 million. The development objective of the project was to improve the effectiveness and
financial viability of irrigation water distribution and management. The project expected to
achieve this objective through (i) strengthening institutional and technical capacity of Water
Users Associations (WUAs) and State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) that would
result in improved management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and increased timeliness
and efficiency of irrigation water delivery; (ii) rehabilitation of on- and off-farm irrigation and
drainage infrastructure serving 56,000 ha and (iii) rehabilitation of Bahramtepe headwork and
sediment basin serving 140,000 ha of agricultural land.
2.    At appraisal, the analysis estimated the financial and economic returns to farm households
and to the economy likely to benefit from the investments in irrigation and drainage
infrastructure and the Bahramtepe network. Benefits to the farm households were expected to
derive from (i) improved yields; (ii) increased area of irrigated land; and (iii) improved cropping
patterns with increased share of lucrative cash crops. While benefits from the investment in the
Bahramtepe headwork were assumed to derive from (i) reduced maintenance costs of on- and
off-farm irrigation infrastructure and (ii) avoided agricultural losses that would occur if the
network collapses.
3.    The appraisal analysis separately estimated returns to (i) the irrigation and drainage
infrastructure rehabilitation component and (ii) the Bahramtepe headwork rehabilitation. The
analysis predicted that the overall project would generate a financial rate of return at 21.0% and
the same rate of economic return. The results of individual analyses suggested that the economic
returns to the investments in the irrigation and drainage infrastructure and the Bahramtepe
headwork would be around 25% and 39%, respectively.
4.    The Project as a whole generated an ENPV of US$74 million or US$963/ha and an EIRR
of 32.9%. The investment in the irrigation and drainage infrastructure generated economic net
incremental benefits with an ENPV of US$46 million and an EIRR of 32.1%. The investment in
the Bahramtepe headwork yielded economic net incremental benefits with an ENPV of US$28
million and an EIRR of 34.5%. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was 28% for the
Project overall.
5.    Several factors contributed to the differences in economic and financial results produced by
the appraisal and the current analyses. These include improvements in the assumed and actual
rehabilitated area, crop yields, cropping pattern improvements, and areas returning to production.
Although the first three factors contributed to the differences in Project benefits, higher
economic and financial results produced by the analysis are mainly attributable to the significant
difference between the predicted and actual area that returned to production (5,600 ha vs.10,500
ha). Although it is too early to fully document the entire Project impact on agricultural
performance, as 2010 was only the third season after the completion of rehabilitation, the results
of the ICR analysis suggest that the Project will reach its development objectives.




                                                37
Methodology
6.    The initial project design and objective remained unchanged over the project
implementation period. Therefore, the current analysis re-estimates the project benefits from the
irrigation and drainage infrastructure rehabilitation following the appraisal methodology but by
applying actual size of rehabilitated area, changes in cropping patterns and yields, benefit
accumulation phases, project costs and revising assumptions on future yields and cropping
patterns. However, it introduces a small modification to the types of benefits deriving from the
investment in the Bahramtepe headwork that would be discussed under a relevant section.
7.    The financial analysis estimates net incremental returns attributable to the project by
comparing returns in the without project (WOP) scenario and with project (WOP) scenario over
20 year project life (e.g., 2004-2023) and using a 12 discount rate. The net incremental benefits
are estimated at: (i) a crop level and (ii) a farm household level.
8.    The analysis mainly based on the results of the Final Survey that has been conducted in
September-November 2009 and has collected comprehensive information on WUAs and their
members, socio-economic characteristics of farm households, agricultural production technology
and output and input prices in the project areas. The survey covered three types of WUAs that:
(i) received rehabilitation assistance from the project; (ii) did not receive rehabilitation support
but benefited from the project activities aimed at strengthening of WUAs; and (iii) did not
receive any assistance from the project (control WUAs).
9.    The rehabilitated lands are located in three different agro-climatic zones with distinctive
cropping patterns and production technology. Therefore, the lands are grouped into three regions
- Northern, Central and Nahkchivan. An average farm household in the Northern region owns
1.82 ha of land while average farms in the Central and the Nahkchivan regions hold 3.13 ha and
0.77 ha, respectively.
10. The financial analysis uses 2009 constant prices for all inputs and outputs for the entire
project period except for the irrigation service fees (ISF). At appraisal, the ISF for the ground
irrigation were estimated approximately at AZN1.0 per 1000m3 which is insufficient to provide
an adequate operation and maintenance to the irrigation and drainage infrastructure. However,
the project's activities (i) supporting WUAs to improve their institutional, managerial and
technical capacities and (ii) improving farmers' awareness resulted in some improvements of the
ISF rates. The average ISF rate in 2009 was estimated at 2 AZN per 1000 m3 although in some
WUAs the rate is recorded at AZN5.0 per 1000m3. According to the engineers' estimates, the
WUAs could properly operate and maintain the infrastructure when the ISF rate is US$18/ha that
corresponds to AZN5.0 per 1000 m3. The analysis conservatively assumes that the ISF will
continue increasing gradually until it reaches 5 AZN per 1000 m3 in 2013 and remains at this
level since then.
11. In the economic analysis, the financial prices were converted into economic prices by
removing taxes and subsidies from input and output prices and calculating import and export
parity prices of major inputs and outputs. A shadow wage rate of 0.8 was used to convert a
financial cost of labor into an economic one. The Government's hectare based direct subsidies
for crops were removed from the financial and economic analyses.




                                                38
Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure Rehabilitation
12. Initially, the project targeted to rehabilitate irrigation and drainage systems serving
approximately 56,000 ha of land. However, due to high inflation rates that reached its peak at
20.8% in 2008, prices for construction materials increased significantly leading to an increase in
the average rehabilitation cost from the appraisal rate of US$300/ha to US$460/ha. As a result,
the Project rehabilitated systems served 53,124 ha or 95% of the targeted area.
13. Shifts to more profitable crops According to the survey results, there were noticeable
changes in cropping patterns towards more lucrative crops both in the rehabilitated and non-
rehabilitated areas although the change occurred at different levels. This natural trend is used as
the basis for the cropping patterns in the without and with project scenarios. In the with project
scenario, the cropping patterns recorded in the rehabilitated areas 1-2 years after rehabilitation
completion, i.e., in 2008/09 were kept constant (e.g., no further improvement in cropping
patterns were assumed). The cropping patterns are summarized in Table A.3.1 below.

14. Similarly, as presented in Table A.3.2, yields for some crops slightly increased even in the
non-rehabilitated areas. This natural trend is applied to the without-project scenario and
availability of such data contributes to a more accurate estimation of the incremental benefits
deriving solely from Project activities.

15. The bulk of the rehabilitation works were completed in 2008 and 2009; thus the survey
does not provide information on the fully potential achievable yields as a result of the improved
timeliness and efficiency of irrigation water delivery. However, on the basis of the yield
improvements achieved in the rehabilitated areas in the first and the second seasons after the
rehabilitation completion (or 2008/09), the analysis conservatively assumes that these 2008/2009
yields will increase by further 2-5%, depending on the sensitivity of the crop to water . These
additional yield improvements are expected to occur during a 3- year period. Consequently, the
Project's full maturity is expected to come in Year 8-11 depending on the rehabilitation
completion year in each WUA. Table A.3.3 summarizes the without and with-project yields.

16. Variable yield improvements. The yield improvements vary from the one region to the
other and consequently, benefits too. Therefore, the analysis provides only examples of some
representative crops in each region. As the results in Table A.3.4 demonstrate, vegetables and
melon show the highest returns at US$475/ha and US$300/ha, respectively. These crops are
followed by lucernes and cotton that generates net incremental margin at US$283/ha and
US$163/ha, respectively. The grains show lower incremental net returns in average at around
US$70/ha.

17. Financial returns to the farm households. The investments in the rehabilitation of the
irrigation and drainage infrastructure generates incremental returns to farm households in the
Northern, Central and Nahkchivan regions at US$1,608, US$2,067 and US$726, respectively.
This will correspond to the incremental gross margins of US$729 per ha in the Northern region,
US$623 in the Central region and US$644 in the Nahkchivan region. The component generates a
FIRR at 25.4 % and a FNPV of US$26 million. Benefit to cost ratio is estimated at 1.74. The
results are summarized in Table A.3.5.

benefits with an ENPV of US$46 million and an EIRR of 32.1%. Benefit-to-cost ratio is
estimated at 2.7 as shown in Table A.3.6.

19. With regard to cost recovery and sustainability, the analysis estimates financial impacts of
an increased ISF rate and a 10% equity contribution to rehabilitation cost at US$460/ha on
household budgets. As the repayment conditions are not defined yet, the analysis assumed that
the equity contribution will be repayable over four year period with a five year grace period. As
the results in Table A.3.7 demonstrate, in PY10-15 the shares of the ISF rates and the 10%equity
contribution in the annual net margin of the farm household vary from 2.2% to 4.0%, while these
shares in the annual net incremental returns to farm households are estimated around 8.0%.
These results imply that the equity contribution (if required to be made) would not be a financial
burden for the farm households.

Bahramtepe Headwork Rehabilitation
20. The appraisal analysis assumed that the benefits to the investment in the Bahramtepe
headwork would derive from the two sources: (i) reduced maintenance costs of on- and off-farm
irrigation infrastructure that would result from the reduced quantities of the silt entering the
irrigation networks and (ii) avoided three year agricultural losses that would occur if the network
collapses leaving 140,000 ha of land without irrigation water. Nevertheless, on the basis of the
discussions with the project engineers and due to a lack of information on `would be reduced'
maintenance costs of on- and off-farm infrastructure, the analysis removed the first source of the
benefit from the analysis. The assumption on the second benefit source proved to be valid as,
according to engineers the flooding that occurred in May 2010 would most likely destroy the
headwork leaving the 140,000 ha of land without water. However, in order to avoid over-

it estimates the benefits only to agricultural land that due to the lack of irrigation water remained
uncultivated before the rehabilitation and returned to production as it became irrigable. Further
details on this change will be discussed below.
21. The Bahramtepe headwork and sediment basin was rehabilitated during 2007-2009 at a
cost of US$13.2 million as opposed to the projected US$4.2 million. As mentioned above, the
headwork serves 140,000 ha of agricultural land of which 33,254 ha was out of the production
due to the lack of the irrigation water. In 2009, when the rehabilitation works were due to
complete, about 10,840 ha of land returned to production. The analysis conservatively assumes
that another 13,300 ha of land will be gradually brought back to the production during 2008-
2020. It further assumes that during the first five year after returning to production this land will
be cultivated with non-cash crops such as wheat and barley. To avoid over-estimation of the
benefits attributable to the project, the analysis assumes that in the without project scenario the
previously uncultivated 33,250 ha would also be used for production of rainfed wheat.
22. Despite these conservative assumptions, the investment in the Bahramtepe headwork
generates financial net incremental benefits with a FIRR of 33.7% and FNPV of US$25.8
million. Benefit to cost ratio is estimated at 3.44. The economic analysis shows that the
component yields economic net incremental benefits an EIRR of 34.5% and an ENPV of
US$28.3 million. Benefit to cost ratio to the investment is 3.87 as shown in Table A.3.8.

Comparison of the appraisal and ICR analyses
24. Several factors contributed to differences in economic and financial results produced by the
appraisal and the current analyses. These include differences in the assumed and the actual (i)
rehabilitated area; (ii) yield improvements; (iii) cropping pattern improvements; and (iv) areas
returning to production. The appraisal analysis estimated benefits to 56,000 hectares of
rehabilitated land while in reality only 53,124 ha were rehabilitated. It adopted more optimistic
assumptions on yields improvements assuming that the crops yields will increase in the range of
15%-45%, while the current analysis expects lower yield improvements (11%-30%). The
appraisal assumptions on the cropping patterns changes were pessimistic, i.e. 69% of area
assumed to be allocated for wheat that would reduce to 65%, while even in the non-rehabilitated
WUAs, only about 40% of the total area was cultivated with wheat in 2006. As the WUAs for
the rehabilitation were still unknown before the project start, the appraisal analysis assumed that
only 5,600 ha are uncultivated. However, around 10,500 ha of those WUAs that were selected
for the rehabilitation program remained uncultivated before the rehabilitation. Although above
mentioned three factors contributed to the differences in project benefits at various degrees, the
higher economic and financial results produced by the current analysis mainly attributable to the
significant differences in the appraisal assumption and the actual area of land that returned to
production. The assumptions and financial indicators used in the appraisal and the current
analyses are summarized in Table A.3.10 below.
25.  The appraisal and current analyses estimated different sources of benefits deriving from the
investment in the Bahramtepe headwork.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Introduction
1.   The end-of-project beneficiary survey conducted in 2009 can be compared with results of
     the baseline survey done in 2005. The following are main findings of the baseline survey:
  a. More than 87% of WUA officers were satisfied with promotion and information campaign;
  b. Attendance of WUA members at Assembly meetings was 72.5% (51.5% in non-project
     raions);
  c. During 2006 project WUAs received on average 74% of their planned irrigation water
     supply;
  d. 9% of water users in project raions & 18% in non-project raions were in default paying
     ISF;
  e. An average of 45 applications for assistance were given to each WUA Dispute Resolution
     Committee, but settlements or sanctions applied were never reported in Assembly
     meetings;
  f. In project WUAs 62% of farmers received more than 50% of water expected; in non-
     project WUAs 77% of farmers received less than 50% of expected deliveries;
  g. Inequity in water delivery and crop yields is found between head and tail-end farmers;
  h. 96% of farmer complaints were related to deteriorated canals and water losses.
2.    The beneficiary survey, hereafter referred to as the `end-of-project survey', was undertaken
by the organization "Ictimayi Ray" to identify the level of sustainability of Water Users'
Associations (WUA) by assessing their representativeness, efficiency, transparency,
accountability and other important characteristics. The purpose of the end-of-project survey was
to estimate the extent to which the project has been successful in achieving a range of benefits
and outcomes that are expected from the creation of sustainable WUAs.
3.    The end-of-project survey was conducted in autumn 2009 and covered all 11 project raions
and 2 non-project ones. Three questionnaires constituted a research tool: 1. household
questionnaire, 2. the questionnaire for irrigation practices and relations with WUA and 3. the
questionnaire for WUA administration and performance  all of them consisting of open, semi-
closed and closed questions. The respondents were selected from the areas with three types of
WUAs. "Rehabilitated" WUAs were selected from the regions in which the project was active;
"non-rehabilitated" WUAs were the ones from the regions of project activity; and the third
category constituted WUAs from the regions of the project inactivity. The total number of
households randomly selected for the interview from these regions amounted to 779 ones. The
surveyed WUAs came from three distinct regions: 1. Guba  Khacmaz region, 2. Raions of Kura
plain, including Goranboy, and 3. Nakhchivan region.

Characteristics of the WUAs and farmers (HHs) Surveyed
4.    WUAs were classified into three categories. "Rehabilitated" WUAs of project raions.
These WUAs benefited from rehabilitation works that included reconstruction of on-farm and
off-farm infrastructure as well as sufficient and timely water delivery works. In addition, these
WUAs have received the training programs, focused on mobilization of water users, provision of
support to WUAs, and ad-hoc advice through regular contacts with Raion Support Units staff.



                                               48
5.   "Non-rehabilitated" WUAs of project raions. These WUAs only benefited from the
Component 1 of the project and didn't get any rehabilitation. WUAs of non-project raions. These
WUAs represent the control group in non-project raions. Other category of the IDSMIP
beneficiaries represents the farmers (water users/WUA members) of several geographical zones.

Farmers (Households) in Central Zone
6.   Raions covered by survey in the Central Zone are Agcabadi, Beylagan, Imishli, Saatli,
Sabirabad, Zardab, Geranboy (project raions) and Ujar was selected as a Control Area.
7.   The average household size is 4.97 persons. In 85.7 % of surveyed HHs the head of the
household is male and only in 14.3% of cases the household head was female. The average
operational farm size is 3.79 ha. Arable land of the farm consists mainly of cereals, vegetables,
fodder crops, fruits and fallow. Wheat is the major crop of the cereals, while the leading fodder
crop is alfalfa. Apple, grapes, and pomegranates dominate the areas of perennials plantations.
Average yield changes are noted in Table A.5.1.

9.    Raions covered by survey in the Northern Zone are Guba, Khachmaz (project raions),
while Gusar was selected as a Control Area. Males are dominant in the farmer family in the
Northern zone of the project (with 98.5% of survey cases featuring males as household heads).
The average household population size as amounted to 5.22 persons. The average operational
size of a farm in the project area is 1.87 ha. Agricultural enterprises in the project area are mainly
mix activity farms, including cropping and livestock breeding. The crops, that grown in this zone
are cereals, vegetables, fodder crops, fruit and fallow mainly. Wheat is the major crop among
cereals. Tomato is the main crop for vegetables, while alfalfa is the most widespread crop among
the fodders. The area of the perennials is covered mainly by apple plantation.
10. It is calculated that in the Northern Zone project WUAs the main crops' yields have
increased in average by 13% in comparison with the baseline, as shown in Table A.5.2. and
Table A.5.3.

Farmers (Households) in Nakhchivan Zone
11. WUAs covered by survey in the Nakhchivan Zone are Nehram (Rehabilitated WUA) and
Sunay (Non-rehabilitated WUA), which are both from Babek Raion and two rehabilitated WUAs
from Sharur Raion: Agridagh and Nalbend. The average household population size is 4.56
persons. The average operational size of land is 1.34 ha. Agricultural activities in the project area
are mainly cropping and livestock breeding together. Arable land of the farms is allocated mainly
to cereals, vegetables, fodder crops, fruits and fallow. Wheat is the major crop of the cereals,
tomatoes of vegetables. Sugar beet is also cultivated in the region. Alfalfa is the major crop
among the fodder ones. Average crop yield changes are noted in Table A.5.4.

13. It is calculated that in rehabilitated WUAs of the Nakhchivan Zone the main crops' yields
have increased in average by 21 % in comparison with the baseline, while the yield of fodder has
increased by more than 50%. The livestock of the farms consists of 1.98 cattle/cow and 10.83
sheep. The average size of poultry population per household amounts to 13.21 heads.

Perceived changes in agricultural performances
14. Over the six years of implementation, IDSMIP has achieved a number of significant
results. The area of irrigated land has increased (see Table A.5.6. and 7), hence reducing the area
of uncultivated lands. The main crop yields increased in average by 23%. Irrigation Service Fees
(ISF) and collection rates have improved. In the WUAs where rehabilitation works took place,
the amount of irrigation water supplies increased almost two times in comparison to non-
rehabilitated WUAs where it is remained at the same rate.

15. The share of highly valued crops, mainly fruits in this region, increased replacing the
traditional wheat production. The increase in the cultivation of the fodder crops is typical for all
regions and can be explained by the commercial advantage of meat production. The cultivation
of crops in WUAs in Central Zone and Nakhchivan is traditional and conservative. The only one
fact that can be pointed out is the decrease of cotton production in the Central Zone WUAs.

Beneficiaries' assessment of project interventions
16. The majority of the respondents of the end-of-project survey mentioned that they had
benefited from promotion and training program component of the project and gained new skills
and knowledge. The farmers indicated data on cropping water norms and proper timing of water
supply as the most important information from the trainings. Feedback from the survey indicates
that only 40% of WUA Administrations have discussed the water distribution plan at the
Assembly.
17. The main benefit from the project and rehabilitation is timely and increased water supply to
the farms. This has allowed farmers to increase the arable land and increase crop yields. The
survey indicates that the majority of farmers (78%) in rehabilitated WUAs are satisfied with
irrigation services while it was only 23% in the baseline survey. The rate of farmers' satisfaction
with the irrigation service in non-rehabilitated and Non-project WUAs is about 37% in average
that also shows an increase in comparison with 23% of the baseline survey figures. It must be
noted that farmers rated quality of irrigation services better than gas provision, as well as service
offered in the case of farm credit.
18. The survey revealed a considerable increase in ISF rates in comparison with the baseline.
However there is a discrepancy among regions in measuring ISF (in some of them ISF rates are
calculated per 1000 m3 and in others - per ha.) The WUAs that don't have or can't use the flow
measurement devices, measure and charge ISF in terms of fee per ha. Both the baseline as well
as the end-of-project survey revealed that WUAs don't apply any sanctions to defaulters for non-
or late payment of ISF. Therefore, it was recommended to introduce a penalty system that will be
stated and approved during the Assembly.

Unaddressed needs and recommendations for future interventions
19. A number of recommendations and suggestions were made by the beneficiaries, PIU staff
and consultants. It is recommended:
 a. To continue awareness raising/ promotion activities in non-project raions with the
    involvement of the most successful WUAs from the project raions
 b. To carry out General/ Representative WUA Assemblies/ meetings in accordance with
    WUA Charter regulations and to protocol these meetings
 c. To calculate ISF in terms of AZN/ 1000m3 and take into account water norms for different
    types of crops
 d. To establish the penalty system and rate for ISF non-payment or delay, prior to discussing
    and approving this at the Assembly
 e. To involve more farmers into the decision-making process on WUA operation , taking into
    account gender equality approach
 f. To ensure transparency of WUA financial performance and report it at the General/
    Representative WUA Assembly



                                                 52
g. For WUAs to become more independent from the Raion Irrigation Departments and be
   more self-sustained
h. To provide necessary machinery and maintenance equipment for WUAs to be able to repair
   and maintain the irrigation and drainage system

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.     A Stakeholders Workshop was held on 23 September 2010 in Baku to discuss experiences
and lessons learned from IDSMIP and recommendations for future development of I&D. 81
participants attended, including representatives of 44 WUA. Four topics were discussed. The
first topic was about the benefits of rehabilitation and expansion of on-farm I&D systems.
Participants were satisfied with the Project, including the legislative reforms, reorganization of
WUA, rehabilitation of some schemes, and improvement of water management. Stakeholders
noted improved water supply and distribution, more effective conflict resolution during
irrigation, lessening of soil salinization in some areas, decrease in groundwater tables where
drainage systems were rehabilitated and installation of water measurement devices. Key
recommendations were: arrange to deal better with inflation of costs of rehabilitation, do not do
rehabilitation during cultivation season, provide more training and financial, legal and technical
support for WUA, install more water measurement devices and revise water supply norms.
2.    Topic 2 was about the needs of WUA for equipment such as excavators, tractors, motor
vehicles, motorcycles and offices. WUA are not willing to share this equipment with other
WUA. Participants recommended provision of equipment to WUA with agreeable terms of cost
sharing, more Bank projects and increasing the ISF to at least 35 AZN.
3.    Topic 3 was about priorities for support services and training. Participants said that WUA
needed support for conflict resolution, financial and legal assistance, awareness raising,
assistance with accounting, and provision of equipment. Support must come from the
government and IFI's since private companies either lacked the ability to help or would charge
costs that the WUA could not afford to pay.
4.   Topic 4 was a summary of main issues and recommendations. The main recommendations
were: i) there should be a needs assessment for each WUA at start of projects like IDSMIP, ii)
involve WUA in project design and planning, iii) give rehabilitation contracts directly to WUA,
iv) build more I&D facilities including water treatment, v) one WUA should manage one
hydraulic unit, vi) build self reliance of WUA and vii) extend rehabilitation to many more WUA.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1.    The Borrower's ICR provided a description of the IDSMIP Project objectives, components,
activities, beneficiaries and results. The Borrower's ICR rated the project satisfactory. The
Borrower's ICR included a description of the implementation of each of the three Project
components: Component 1: Development of Water Users' Associations, Component II:
Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure, including rehabilitation of the
Bahramtape headworks, and Component III: Project Management. How Project procurement and
financing were done are also briefly described. The Borrower's ICR provided detailed
descriptions of all the different training courses provided for WUA as well as descriptions of
each contract implemented for rehabilitation and environmental monitoring. The section on
Monitoring and Evaluation described the database to be prepared that would include findings
from Monitoring and Evaluation and implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation.
2.      The key findings of end-of-project survey are following:
         100% of WUA Administration in the survey raions prepared the water distribution plan
         on the base of tables and charts indicating the farmers' land share and the crops they
         traditionally cultivate on it and in 54% of cases (64 % of WUAs benefited under project
         rehabilitation) they directly asked farmers on what farmers had planned to cultivate this
         year or whether there were some changes with respect to the previous year.
         In WUAs benefited from the project rehabilitation, the amount of irrigation water
         supplied to WUAs increased almost two times while in without rehabilitation WUAs is
         remained at the same rate. The most progress can been seen in Northern Zone WUAs
         where the rate of that indicator increased two and a half times and in some cases tripled.
         An average four irrigations has been applied according to crop water norms for main
         crops by 82% of water users in rehabilitated schemes.
         The cultivated area increased by 25% in the rehabilitated WUAs while in the non-
         rehabilitated WUAs it remained at the same rate as in the baseline. In the Northern Zone
         non-rehabilitated WUAs the arable land decreased by 28%.
         The main crops' yields increased in average on 17.7% in rehabilitated WUAs comparison
         with the baseline, while the yields of crops in non-rehabilitated WUAs also increased but
         on 4.3%.
         100% collection rate of ISF for SAIA, for rehabilitated WUAs - 81% in average. ISF
         rates increased 3-5 times in comparison with 2006.
         The Revenue Budget increased 4.4 times in average in WUAs under project rehabilitation
         in comparison with the baseline and it increased 2.3 times in average in WUAs without
         project rehabilitation.
         In 22 project WUAs that have benefited from rehabilitation and modernization it has
         been carried out 91% of the planned O&M. The Administrations of rehabilitated WUAs
         have spent money for O&M from WUA budget and in average amount that is 4 times
         greater than in the baseline year..
         Feedback from the survey indicates that about 78% of farmers in rehabilitated WUAs are
         satisfied with irrigation services while it was only 23% in the baseline case.
         Larger proportion of WUAs' members are willing to pay more for better service.




                                                 55
3.    The Borrower's ICR found the following lessons that should be taken into account in the
future for WUA Development:
       IDSMIP showed that the approach of supporting WUAs with training and rehabilitation
       is successful: (i) rehabilitated WUAs perform much better than non-rehabilitated WUAs;
       and (ii) rehabilitated WUAs charge significantly higher ISFs.
       It's important to strengthen the capacity of WUAs and expose them to the international
       best practice from the very beginning of the Project. The experience showed that WUA
       leadership exposed to international practice from the beginning demonstrate diversity in
       the way they operate and willingness for more changes than their counterparts.
       Limited institutional experience in preparing legal normative documents exacerbated by
       bureaucratic delays cause more delays in the Project implementation, hence creating need
       for more targeted training.
       It's important WUAs prepare their annual action plans. The experience showed that
       WUAs without annual action plans demonstrate weak tendency towards development.
       It's important to train the WUA staff on the technical aspects of hydraulic structures in
       their respective command areas.
       Social inclusion by informed membership and representatives contributes highly to the
       normal functioning of the WUAs.
       It's important to train WUAs on preparation of water requirement plans, as the lack in the
       preparation of the mentioned plans cause serious problems in supplying water to WUAs.

4.  The following were Borrower's ICR comments about lessons learned on Project
Management:
       It is important to develop capacity of PIU for institutional issues and effective
       implementation of multicontractual projects. Especially limited experience in planning
       implementation of rehabilitation works in areas with ongoing intensive irrigation should
       be eliminated. IDSMIP showed that limited experience in cooperation with WUA
       members in rehabilitation contracts inversely affects the overall progress of project
       implementation.
       Limited experience on price increase implications on rehabilitation works, as these
       increases are not possible to foresee.
       Good supervision work is essential for satisfactory outcome. Besides the quality and
       commitment of PIU staff, the high quality and the continuity of supervision WB missions
       was industrial to the satisfactory implementation of the project. The proper skill-mix is
       important to enable participation of experts on a need basis.
