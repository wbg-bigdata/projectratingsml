Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Improvement Project (IDSMIP) 
is 
to improve 
the effectiveness 
and 
financial 
viability 
of 
irrigation 
water 
distribution 
and 
management 
on 
56,000 
ha, 
through 
provision 
of 
support 
to 
Water Users Associations 
(WUA) 
and 
the 
State 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
Committee 
(SAIC). 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
proposed 
Irrigation Distribution 
System 
and 
Management 
To 
achieve 
this 
objective 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
funds 
for 
the 
development 
of 
WUA-related 
institutional 
capacity 
in 
SAIC, 
for 
training 
and 
support 
to 
WUAs 
to 
become 
organizations that 
can take 
charge 
of 
the 
operation 
and maintenance 
(O&M) 
of 
irrigation 
and drainage 
systems 
under 
their 
management, 
and 
for 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems.

Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal 
supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
19586-AZ 
The 
main 
emphasis 
of 
the 
CAS for 
the 
period 
2000-02 
has 
been 
on 
establishing 
an 
appropriate 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
09/14/1999 
institutional 
and 
policy 
framework, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
focusing 
on 
infrastructure 
development, 
aimed at 
broad-based 
economic growth, employment 
creation, 
and 
poverty alleviation. 
This 
was, 
inter 
alia, 
achieved 
through 
reform 
of 
public 
sector 
institutions 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
manage 
the country's 
natural 
resources 
efficiently 
and 
to 
ensure 
that economic 
growth 
leads 
to 
accelerated 
poverty 
reduction. 
A 
new 
CAS 
is 
under 
preparation, 
with 
an expected 
Board 
discussion 
on 
May 
27,2003. 
The 
future 
challenge 
for 
Azerbaijan 
is 
to 
design 
and 
implement 
a 
policy 
agenda 
that 
would 
lead 
to poverty 
reduction 
and 
would 
improve 
incomes 
as 
well 
as 
equity. 
The 
proposed Bank's 
assistance 
strategy 
would 
tackle 
two 
key 
issues 
that were 
identified 
in 
the 
recently 
approved 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(SPPRED; 
approved 
by 
Presidential 
Decree 
of 
February 
20,2003), 
namely: 
(i) 
generating 
productive 
employment, 
especially 
by 
strengthening 
the 
development 
of 
agriculture, 
as 
the 
most 
important 
non-oil 
sector, 
which 
provides 
ample 
opportunities 
for 
expanding output and income 
of 
Azerbaijan's 
rural 
population; and 
(ii) 
reversing 
the 
decline 
in 
physical 
and social infrastructure, and 
improving 
access 
for 
the 
poor. 
Elements 
of 
Government's 
policy 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
are 
described 
in 
the SPPRED. 
This 
development 
is 
to 
be 
accomplished 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
rural 
development 
policy, crucial 
for 
the 
reduction 
in 
differences 
in 
living 
standards 
between 
Baku 
and 
rural 
regions. 
The 
SPPRED 
puts 
the development 
of 
agriculture 
in 
the 
context 
of 
an 
integrated 
rural 
development 
policy, 
including 
linkages 
to 
non-farming activities 
such 
as 
ago-processing, 
industry, 
handicrafts, 
retail, distribution, 
transport, 
and 
construction, and 
taking 
into 
account 
environmental 
concerns. 
The 
SPPRED also presents 
the importance 
of 
irrigation 
for 
agricultural 
production, and the 
need 
for 
public 
investment 
to 
rehabilitate 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
to 
reverse 
the 
ongoing 
deterioration, and 
make 
them 
more efficient. 
Higher 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness also 
require 
improvements 
in 
management, 
which 
is 
why 
further 
development 
of 
WAS 
is 
mentioned 
as 
important. 
Finally, 
it 
is 
stated 
in 
the 
SPPRED that 
it 
is 
important 
to 
introduce 
gradually 
cost 
recovery 
systems 
for 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
to 
assure 
sustainability, 
but 
until 
this 
is 
achieved, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
allocate 
public 
money 
for 
O&M 
of 
state 
owned 
infrastructure. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
Government's 
strategy. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
respond 
to 
a recommendation 
of 
the 
2002 
Poverty 
Assessment, 
which 
calls 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure, 
institutional 
reforms 
in 
irrigation 
management, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
WAS. 
The 
project 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Bank's 
new Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
(RDS) 
- 
Reaching 
the 
Rural Poor 
(October 2003). 
This 
Strategy acknowledges 
that 
agricultural 
development 
plays a central 
role 
in 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
most developing 
countries. 
It 
puts 
a 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
as 
a prerequisite 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
any 
rural 
development and 
poverty 
reduction effort. 
Agriculture 
depends 
fundamentally 
on 
natural 
resources 
and 
has 
an 
important 
role 
in 
their 
conservation. 
The 
project 
would 
thus 
address 
one 
of 
the objectives 
of 
the 
Bank's 
RDS 
by 
improving 
the 
sustainable 
use 
of 
water through 
improved 
water 
management. 
It 
would 
focus 
on 
several 
important 
components 
of 
achieving 
efficient 
use 
of 
water 
in 
agriculture 
as 
proposed 
by 
the 
new 
RDS 
and the 
recently 
approved 
Bank 
Water 
Resources 
Management 
Strategy (February 
2003), 
including: 
(i) 
scaling-up 
user 
participation 
in 
irrigation 
management, 
notably 
through 
WUAs, 
and 
ensuring 
their 
professional and 
financial 
independence; 
(ii) 
concentrating the investment 
priorities 
in 
-3- 
Page  8
agricultural water 
on 
improving 
the 
productivity 
of 
existing irrigation 
systems; 
and 
(iii) 
promoting 
institutional reforms 
and 
capacity 
building 
of 
sector 
agencies 
responsible 
for 
irrigation 
system 
management. 
The 
project 
was 
first 
proposed 
in 
the 
mid-nineties 
as 
one 
of 
two 
IDA-funded 
investments 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sector. 
Preparation 
of 
the 
first 
irrigation project took much 
longer 
than anticipated 
- 
the 
Rehabilitation and 
Completion 
of 
Irrigation 
and 
Drainage 
Infrastructure Project 
(RIDIP, 
P008284; 
FYOO) 
was 
approved 
only 
in 
June 
2000 
- 
thus 
preparation 
of 
the 
second 
project 
was 
postponed, 
after 
some 
initial 
preparation 
work 
took 
place. 
RIDIP 
focuses 
on 
rehabilitation 
and 
completion 
of 
major 
conveyance 
irrigation 
systems 
and 
collector 
drains, 
and 
does 
not 
work 
on 
infrastructure 
within 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms 
(defined 
in 
this 
PAD 
as 
'former 
farm', 
while 
the 
irrigation 
and drainage 
infrastructure 
in 
these 
former 
farms 
is 
defined 
as 
'on-farm' 
infrastructure). 
It 
also 
does 
not 
focus 
on 
the 
development 
of 
management 
capacity 
within 
these 
former 
farms. 
During 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
however, there 
has 
been 
a 
positive 
momentum 
with 
the 
development 
of

Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Background. 
The agricultural 
sector 
is 
an important part 
of 
the 
economy 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
In 
2001, 
it 
contributed 
about 
17 
percent 
of 
Gross 
Domestic 
Product 
(GDP), 
and 
provided income and 
employment 
for 
about 
3 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
economically 
active 
population. 
The 
sector produces 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
products 
and 
was 
at 
one 
time 
a large producer 
of 
cotton, 
fruits, 
vegetables, wheat, 
and 
wine 
for 
Soviet 
Union 
markets. 
During 
the 
transition 
period (from 
1991 
to 
1995), 
agncultural 
output 
fell 
rapidly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
collapse 
of 
trade 
relations 
with 
the 
former 
Soviet 
partners, macro-economic 
instability, and 
the 
conflict 
with 
Armenia. 
Agricultural 
output 
declined 
by 
more 
than 
50 
percent 
and the 
share 
of 
agriculture 
in 
total 
exports 
declined 
from 
30 percent 
in 
1990 
to 
seven 
percent 
in 
1995. 
Ongoing 
Reforms. 
After 
an 
initially 
slow 
start 
to 
the 
agncultural 
reform 
process, 
the 
country 
has 
moved 
ahead 
rapidly 
since 1996 
with 
implementation 
of 
basic 
reforms 
in 
agriculture, 
following 
the 
success 
of 
the 
macro-economic 
stabilization 
program. 
The 
long-term goal 
of 
the 
agricultural reforms 
is 
development 
of 
a 
market-oriented, 
competitive 
and diverse 
agricultural 
sector, 
serviced 
by 
well-functioning 
input 
and 
output 
markets. 
The 
main 
achievements 
to 
date 
include: 
(i) 
the 
discontinuation 
of 
central 
planning 
and 
price 
control; 
(ii) 
abolition 
of 
the 
state 
order 
system; 
(iii) 
the 
liberalization 
of 
domestic and external 
trade 
in 
agricultural 
commodities; 
(iv) 
the 
liquidation 
of 
state 
and 
collective 
farms 
and 
distribution 
of 
land; 
and 
(v) 
initial 
phases 
of 
restructuring 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture. 
Almost 
all 
state 
and 
collective 
farms 
have been disbanded and 97 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
arable 
land 
(1.6 
million 
ha) 
has 
been 
privatized 
and 
distributed 
to 
869,000 
farm 
families 
in 
one 
of 
the 
most 
comprehensive 
agrarian 
land reform 
programs 
in 
the 
FSU. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
agricultural reforms 
the 
agricultural 
output 
has 
increased, 
and 
in 
2000 
was 
at 
a 
level 
of 
23 
percent 
higher 
than 
in 
1995. 
The 
growth 
in 
agriculture 
continued 
in 
2001 
and 
2002, 
with 
11 
and 6 
percent 
respectively. 
This 
recovery 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
early 
easy 
gains 
from 
improved 
farm 
management and increased 
labor 
productivity arising 
from 
the 
reforms. 
About 
96 percent 
of 
agncultural 
output 
is 
now 
produced 
by 
small-scale 
individual 
farmers 
working 
on 
the 
privatized 
plots. 
Agriculture 
remains 
the 
second 
largest 
sector 
(after 
industry 
- 
mainly 
oil), 
with 
potential 
export markets 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
Europe, 
and 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union 
(FSU).

The 
main 
crops 
now 
are 
cereals 
(predominantly 
wheat), 
cotton, 
potatoes, 
fruits 
and 
vegetables. 
Areas, 
yields 
and 
production 
of 
the 
main 
crops 
are 
given 
in 
table 
1 
below. 
The 
area 
under 
cereals 
has 
increased 
from 
583,000 
ha 
in 
1990 
to 
647,000 
ha 
in 
2001, 
and 
the 
average 
yield 
in 
2001 
was 
2.4 ton/ha, 
up 
from 
a 
low 
of 
1.5 
todha 
in 
1995. 
The 
area 
under 
cotton 
and 
its 
yield 
declined 
dramatically 
since 
1990, 
which 
is 
mainly 
caused 
by 
input 
and 
marketing 
problems, and 
the 
unreliability 
of 
irrigation 
water 
supply 
and 
distribution. 
The 
areas 
under 
potatoes and 
vegetables 
have also increased. Vegetable 
yields 
are 
still 
much 
lower 
than 
in 
1991 and even 
still 
somewhat 
lower 
than 
in 
1995. 
From 
1995 
to 
2001 
fruit 
yields 
doubled, 
but 
the 
aggregate area decreased 
by 
18 
percent. 
Despite 
the general 
positive 
trend, the 
yields 
remain 
low 
by 
world 
standards, 
and there 
is 
still 
much 
room for 
yield 
increases.

Remaining 
Reform 
and 
Development Challenges. 
While 
the 
reforms 
have created 
an 
enabling 
environment 
for 
the development 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
and 
helped 
to 
restore 
growth, 
the 
sector 
still 
faces 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
remaining 
constraints 
which 
impede 
the increase 
of 
output 
to 
potential 
levels. 
Principal 
constraints 
include: 
(i) 
lack 
of 
a 
functioning real 
estate 
registry 
system, 
which 
undermines 
security 
of 
tenure based 
on 
land 
titles; 
(ii) 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
credit 
due 
to 
a 
non-functional 
rural 
financial 
market; 
(iii) 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
good 
quality, 
high 
yielding 
seeds; 
(iv) 
limited 
technical 
and 
managerial 
know-how 
of 
farmers 
and 
insufficient 
advisory 
services; 
(v) 
demise 
of 
the 
agro-industrial 
sector; 
(vi) 
absence 
of 
an 
adequate 
marketing 
system; 
and 
(vii) 
declining 
access 
to 
water 
due 
to 
the 
rapid 
deterioration 
of 
the 
irrigation 
systems. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
continue 
the 
reform 
process 
and 
the 
assistance 
to 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
realizing 
it 
serves 
as 
an important 
source 
of 
livelihood 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
rural 
population. 
-5- 
Page  10
It 
is 
expected 
that, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
donors, 
most 
of 
the 
issues 
that 
constrain 
agricultural 
growth 
mentioned 
above 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
addressed. 
IDA 
provides 
substantial 
assistance 
to 
the 
sector. 
The 
Farm 
Privatization Project 
(FPP; 
P040544, 
FY97) 
and 
the 
Agricultural 
Development 
and 
Credit Program 
(ADCP; 
P035813, 
FY99) 
are 
designed 
to 
support 
the 
development 
of 
a 
farm 
information 
and advisory 
system, 
real 
estate 
registration, 
and 
rural 
credit 
system. 
The 
first 
IDA 
project 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector, 
RIDIP, 
supports 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
main irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
and 
makes 
a 
start 
with 
institutional 
development 
to 
improve 
irrigation 
management 
by 
the 
State 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
Committee 
of 
some 
larger 
hydraulic 
units. 
A 
Rural 
Investment 
Project 
is 
planned 
for 
FY04. 
Irrigation 
and 
Drainage 
Sub-sector 
Background. 
Azerbaijan 
has 
nine 
distinct agro-climatic 
zones 
and 
offers potential 
for 
highly 
diversified 
agriculture. 
Except 
for 
areas 
near 
the 
foothills 
and 
the south-eastern 
part 
of 
the 
country, 
apculture 
is 
to 
a large 
degree 
dependent 
on 
irrigation, 
due 
to 
low 
rainfall.  Almost 
all 
agricultural 
land 
faces 
arid 
or 
semi-arid 
conditions 
with 
average 
annual 
rainfall 
of 
200-300 
mm. 
For 
example, 
the 
average 
annual 
rainfall 
in 
Imishli 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
Kura 
plain 
is 
254 
mm, 
with 
only 
55 
percent 
falling 
inside 
the 
main 
growing 
season 
from 
April 
through 
October. 
Evapotranspiration 
during 
the 
growing 
season 
is 
high 
due 
to 
low 
humidity 
and 
high 
day 
time 
temperatures. 
On 
average 
it 
will 
exceed 
effective 
rainfall 
by 
a 
factor 
of 
five or 
more.  Consequently, 
irrigation 
is 
a 
key 
input 
for 
reliable 
crop 
production, 
and about 
90 percent 
of 
all 
agricultural 
output 
comes 
from 
irrigated 
lands. 
Thus 
issues 
and constraints 
affecting 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector have 
a large 
impact 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector. 
The 
total 
area 
developed 
for 
irrigation 
is 
1.45 
million 
ha. 
There 
is 
a 
high 
reliance 
on 
pumped 
irrigation to 
abstract 
water 
from 
main 
canals, 
with 
about 
440,000 
ha 
receiving 
water 
through 
at 
least one 
level 
of 
pumping. 
Irrigation 
water 
is 
predominantly distributed through 
open canal 
systems 
and 
surface-applied 
to 
the 
land. 
At 
present about 
1.1 
million 
ha 
is 
being 
irrigated, although 
often 
this 
is 
only 
a 
single 
or 
double 
irrigation 
turn. 
Drainage 
is 
essential 
for 
many 
irrigation 
systems 
in 
Azerbaijan, 
but 
most 
critical 
in 
the 
flat 
low-lying 
Kura-Araz 
and Mugan-Salyan plains, 
totaling 
about 
760,000 
ha, 
where 
soil 
salinity 
has 
developed 
for lack 
of 
natural 
drainage. 
This 
is 
a 
normal 
phenomenon 
in 
all 
aridsemi-arid 
zones. 
Unavoidable 
losses 
of 
irrigation 
water, even 
when 
irrigation 
is 
efficient, 
will 
cause 
the 
groundwater 
to 
rise. 
When 
natural 
drainage 
is 
insufficient, 
the 
rootzone 
becomes 
waterlogged 
and, 
due 
to 
high 
evaporation 
rates 
in 
these 
climatic 
zones, 
salinization 
occurs. 
Natural 
drainage 
has 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
artificially 
installed 
drainage 
systems, 
and 
leaching 
has 
to 
be 
carried 
out. 
Water Resources. 
Azerbaijan 
has 
an 
average 
annual renewable water 
supply 
of 
32 
billion 
m3, 
only 
30 
percent 
of 
which 
is 
generated 
within 
Azerbaijan. 
River 
flows 
are considerable, 
but 
there 
are 
large 
annual 
and 
seasonal 
fluctuations. 
Most 
of 
the 
flow 
is 
from 
rainfall, 
with 
a 
contribution 
from 
snow 
of around 
25 
percent. 
The 
reliance 
on 
storage 
is 
high, 
with 
an 
overall 
capacity 
of 
about 
22 
billion 
m3. 
The 
average 
annual 
water 
use 
is 
about 
17 
billion 
m3, 
with 
agriculture 
accounting 
for 
about 
70 
percent. 
Almost 
all 
irrigation 
water 
is 
from 
international 
rivers, 
the 
major 
ones 
being 
the 
Kura, 
Araz, 
Alazani, 
Iori 
(all 
tributaries 
of 
Kura), 
and 
the 
Samur. 
Azerbaijan 
is 
the lowest 
riparian 
for 
all 
these 
rivers. 
The 
Kura 
River 
rises 
in 
Georgia 
and 
flows 
southeast 
through 
Azerbaijan, 
draining 
into 
the 
Caspian 
Sea. 
The 
Araz 
River 
rises 
in 
Turkey 
and 
flows 
east 
and 
southeast 
along 
the 
Armenian-Turkish 
border, 
and 
then 
along 
the 
border 
of 
Azerbaijan 
and 
Iran. 
It 
then 
turns 
northeast 
and 
joins 
the 
Kura 
River 
in 
Azerbaijan,  120 
km 
before 
it 
drains 
into 
the Caspian 
Sea. 
Both 
the 
Iori 
and 
Alazani 
start 
in 
Georgia 
and 
the 
Samur 
river 
in 
Dagistan. 
River 
characteristics 
are 
given 
in 
the 
next 
table. 
There 
are 
no 
formal 
-6- 
Page  11
water sharing 
agreements 
between 
Georgia 
and 
Azerbaijan, 
except 
for 
the 
Iori 
River. 
However, 
the 
Kura 
flow 
far 
exceeds 
the 
use 
in 
Georgia, 
and 
reservoirs 
on 
the 
Kura 
in 
Azerbaijan 
balance 
out major 
fluctuations 
in 
flow. 
A 
1963 
water 
sharing 
agreement 
for 
the 
Araz 
River 
between 
the 
Soviet 
Union 
and 
Iran 
remains 
in 
place, 
as 
Azerbaijan 
and 
Iran 
have agreed 
to 
continue 
to 
honor 
the 
terms 
of 
this 
agreement. 
The 
two 
countries 
meet 
at least 
once 
per 
year 
- 
normally 
in 
July 
- 
to 
agree 
on 
the 
water 
sharing 
for 
the 
next 
season. 
This 
involves 
both 
energy 
and 
water 
sharing 
from 
the 
Araz 
Reservoir, 
located 
on 
the 
border 
between 
Nakhchivan 
and Iran, and 
from 
the 
Mill-Mugan 
headworks 
at 
Horadz 
on 
the 
Araz 
River. 
The 
sharing 
principle 
is 
on 
a 
50 
- 
50 
basis, 
but 
exceptions 
are 
sometimes agreed 
when 
a 
country 
requests 
more 
water. 
The 
requirements 
at 
the 
Mill-Mugan 
headworks 
are 
such 
that a large 
volume of 
water 
is 
released 
for 
downstream 
use 
in 
Azerbaijan.

As 
indicated 
above, 
Azerbaijan 
relies 
heavily 
on 
reservoirs 
to 
manage 
its 
water 
resources. 
The 
three largest 
reservoirs 
in 
the 
country 
are 
Shamlur 
and 
Mingechevir 
on 
the 
Kura 
River, 
and 
Araz 
on 
the 
Araz 
River. 
There 
are 
a number 
of 
smaller reservoirs 
with 
storage 
capacity 
less 
than 
100 
million 
m3. 
The 
Mingechevir 
and 
Araz 
waters 
are 
not only 
used 
for 
irrigation, 
but 
also 
for 
hydropower. 
There 
are 
no 
reservoirs 
on 
the 
Alazani 
and 
Kura 
upstream 
in 
Georgia, 
so 
inflow from 
these 
rivers 
into 
Shamlur 
and 
Mingechevir 
varies 
from 
year 
to 
year due 
to 
rainfall 
and 
snowfall 
variation. 
Reservoir

are

Shamkir 
I 
Inflow into 
the 
major 
reservoirs 
varies 
considerably 
from 
year 
to 
year. 
During 
2000 
and 
2001, 
Mingechevir 
Reservoir 
was 
at a 
lower level 
than 
any 
time 
since 
it 
was 
built, 
due 
to 
a 
major 
drought 
in 
the 
region. 
This 
year 
the 
situation 
is 
much 
better 
and 
the 
dam 
has, 
at the 
end 
of 
April 
2003, 
already 
filled 
to 
over 
13 
billion 
m3. 
The 
inflow 
into 
the 
Araz 
Reservoir 
has 
reduced substantially 
during 
the 
second 
part 
ofthe 
nineties, 
as 
part 
of 
recurrent 
drought 
cycles. 
Inflow 
this 
year 
has 
been 
substantial 
and 
the stored 
volume 
is 
now 
1.2 
billion 
m3. 
There 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
trend, however, 
that 
there 
will 
be 
quite 
often 
deficits 
of water 
in 
the 
lower KuraIAraz 
basin. 
Thus,

at the 
distribution 
and 
field 
level 
would 
be 
very 
important. 
Ineffective 
water 
management 
was 
also 
identified 
as 
a 
major 
environmental 
issue 
in 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP; 
1998). 
Other 
irrigation 
sub-sector 
related 
issues 
that were 
identified 
in 
the 
NEAP 
include: 
(i) 
large 
areas 
affected 
by 
water 
logging 
and 
salinization; and 
(ii) 
soil 
erosion 
due 
to poor 
management 
of 
water 
application 
at 
field 
level. 
Current 
State 
Policy. 
The 
Government 
has 
initiated 
various 
reform 
measures 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector 
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
reform. 
The 
Law 
on 
Agricultural 
Reform 
Principles 
(1 
995) 
identified 
reforms 
in 
the 
water and 
amelioration 
sector 
as 
one 
of 
the 
main 
directions 
of 
the 
reform 
process. 
A 
concept 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
sector 
for 
the 
period 
up 
to 
2010 
was 
approved 
in 
1996, 
in 
which 
the 
main 
directions 
for 
development 
activities 
were determined, such 
as 
rehabilitation 
of 
priority 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
schemes, 
improvement 
of 
water 
management, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
an 
Irrigation 
Service 
Fee. 
As 
noted 
above, 
the 
recently 
approved 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and Economic 
Development 
recognizes the 
importance 
of 
irrigation 
for 
agricultural 
production 
and 
indicates 
State 
policy 
towards 
continuing 
institutional 
reforms 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
in 
order 
to improve 
the 
management 
of 
the 
country's 
natural 
resources and create 
conditions 
for 
sustainable 
agricultural 
production. 
Legislation. 
Azerbaijan 
does 
not 
have an 
adequate 
and appropriate 
legal framework 
in 
place 
for 
the 
establishment 
and 
sustainable 
operation 
of 
WUAs. 
A 
review 
of 
the 
existing 
legislation found 
no 
specific 
legal 
framework 
for 
WUAs 
in 
the current legislation. 
There 
are 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
references 
to 
WAS, 
one 
in 
the 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
(Law No. 
116-IQ, 
dated June 
5, 
1996), 
and 
others 
in 
subordinate 
legislation.  The 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
makes 
a 
provision (Article 
24) 
that 
farmers 
could 
establish Water Users Associations 
to 
manage 
irrigation facilities 
within 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms. 
However 
the 
law 
provides 
no 
detail 
as 
to 
how 
WAS 
are 
to 
be 
established 
or 
operate. 
The 
only 
other 
references 
to 
WAS 
are 
in 
subordinate 
legislation 
and 
these 
too 
are 
little 
more 
than 
passing references. 
The 
existing 
WUAs 
are 
in 
fact 
companies or, 
to 
be 
more 
specific, 
limited liability 
enterprises 
established 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Law 
on Limited Liability 
Enterprises, 
dated 
December 
29, 
1998. 
From 
a 
legal 
perspective they 
are 
not 
'associations' 
at 
all 
and they 
are 
basically 
free 
to 
undertake any 
kind 
of 
lawful 
commercial activity.  The 
standard 
model 
charter, 
which 
was 
developed 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Farm 
Privatization 
Project, 
and 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Government, 
would 
not 
be 
adequate 
for 
the proposed 
IDSMIP. 
Even 
if 
it 
was 
to 
be 
revised, the 
fact 
remains that 
the 
limited 
liability 
enterprise 
is 
not 
a suitable 
legal 
form 
on 
which 
to 
base 
the 
establishment 
of 
WAS. 
The 
Water 
Code (December 1997) 
purports 
to 
regulate 
the 
legal 
aspects 
of 
water relations 
between 
the 
State 
and 
users, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
private and 
public 
sector. 
However, 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
called 
for 
by 
the 
code 
are 
not 
clear and 
thus 
there 
is 
some 
overlap 
and uncertainty 
as 
to 
the 
respective 
roles 
of 
SAIC 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Ecology 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
(MENR). 
Another 
weakness 
of 
the code 
is 
that 
it 
does 
not 
create 
an 
appropriate 
framework 
for 
overall 
water 
resources 
planning, water 
allocation 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
secure 
water 
rights, 
thus 
failing to 
address 
the 
key 
issues 
needed 
in 
a 
water code 
in 
a market 
economy. 
SAIC 
has expressed 
interest 
to 
receive 
FA0 
assistance 
in 
addressing 
some 
of 
the broader water 
resources 
issues. 
By 
Resolution 
of 
the 
Cabinet 
of 
Ministers 
(No. 
43, 
dated 
March 
15,2000), 
the 
on-farm 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
was 
transferred 
to 
the 
books 
of 
SAIC, 
which 
was 
compelled 
to 
take 
responsibility 
for 
maintenance. 
Until 
then, 
SAIC had 
only 
been 
responsible 
for 
the 
O&M 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
outside 
the boundaries 
of 
the 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms (defined 
in 
this 
document 
as 
'off-farm' 
infrastructure). 
This 
additional responsibility 
places a 
serious 
burden 
on 
the 
Committee 
during 
times 
of 
funding 
shortage. 
Resolution 
No. 
17 
of 
January 
2 
1,2002 
changed 
the 
ISF 
-8- 
Page  13
from 
volumetric 
to 
area 
based, 
with 
a 
fixed 
per 
hectare 
rate 
per 
raion, 
independent 
of 
the crop irrigated. 
This 
fee 
setting 
structure 
does 
not 
encourage 
efficient 
water 
use. 
Resolution 
No. 
97 
(June 17,2002) 
restricts the 
amount 
of 
fees 
to 
be 
collected 
by 
use 
of 
a 
WUA 
for 
O&M 
to 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
amount 
required 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
SAIC. 
The 
argument 
for 
this 
resolution 
is 
that 
it 
protects 
members 
from 
unresponsive 
chairmen 
and 
other 
hired 
staff. 
This 
problem 
can 
be 
solved 
when 
WUA 
members 
are 
in 
control, 
not 
hired 
staff. 
Once 
WUAs 
are 
organized 
as 
true 
farmer 
associations, 
the 
requirement 
for 
'protection' 
would no 
longer 
be 
a 
reason 
for 
SAIC 
to 
involve 
itself 
in 
the 
internal affairs 
of 
an association. 
Clear and appropriate 
provisions 
on 
tariff 
setting 
are needed, 
which would 
allow 
WUAs 
to 
determine 
their 
own 
tariffs 
for 
the 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
on-farm 
systems, 
free 
of 
government 
interference. 
Insufficient 
Funds for  Operation 
and 
Maintenance. 
Since 
its 
establishment 
in 
1993, 
SAIC 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
off-farm 
infrastructure. 
Almost 
all 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure was developed 
during 
the 
Soviet 
era. 
It 
was 
often 
constructed 
with 
little 
consideration 
of 
economic cost 
or 
long-term 
viability. 
O&M 
budgets 
have 
been 
drastically cut after 
Independence 
in 
1991. 
A 
recent 
survey 
of 
project 
areas 
of 
the 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Completion 
of 
Irrigation 
and 
Drainage 
Infrastructure Project 
found 
that around 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
has been 
deteriorating 
in 
some 
form 
and 
needs 
attention. 
The 
2002 
budget 
for SAIC 
was 
AZM 
175 
billion 
(about 
US 
$36 
million, 
using 
an 
April 
2003 exchange 
rate 
of 
AZM 
4,885 
per 
US 
S), 
about 
AZM 
15 
billion 
higher 
than 
the 2001 
budget. 
The 
budget 
is 
about 
half 
of 
SAIC's estimated 
requirement 
of 
AZM 
350 
billion 
to 
adequately 
operate 
and 
maintain off-farm 
systems, 
including major irrigation 
diversion 
structures 
and 
reservoirs. 
The current budget 
is 
mostly 
used 
for 
staff 
costs 
and recurrent operational 
expenditures, 
especially 
energy 
costs. 
A 
major 
issue 
with 
pumps 
is 
that 
many 
are 
old 
and 
becoming increasingly 
inefficient 
and 
thus 
expensive 
to 
run. 
The 
recent 
budgets 
include 
also 
small 
allocations 
for 
maintenance 
of 
on-farm 
works. 
For 
example, 
AZM 
9 
billion 
was 
made 
available 
in 
200 
1. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
is 
a 
token 
amount 
compared 
to 
the actual budget 
required 
to 
maintain 
the 
on-farm 
irrigation 
systems 
properly. 
The 
lack 
of 
maintenance 
has 
a 
serious 
impact 
on 
overall 
water 
use 
efficiency, 
which 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
no 
more 
than 
20 
to 
30 
percent. 
This 
low 
efficiency 
requires 
large water 
abstractions, 
which 
increases 
the 
entrance 
of 
sediments 
in 
systems. 
Low 
Irrigation 
Service 
Fee. 
The 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
stipulates 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
system 
of 
payment 
of 
ISF. Azerbaijan introduced 
ISF 
in 
1997. 
Through 
a 
Water 
Tariff 
Committee, 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economic 
Development, 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, 
SAIC 
calculated a 
blend 
ISF for 
each 
of 
the 
raions 
varying 
from 
AZM 
3,800 
to 
AZM 
203,000 
per 
1,000 
m3. 
The country-wide 
blend 
ISF would 
be 
AZM 
28,700 
per 
1,000 
m3. 
SAIC 
calculated that water 
users 
would 
contribute 
AZM 
172 
billion 
to 
its 
budget 
per 
year, 
if 
full 
payments 
would 
be 
made, 
considering 
an estimated annual 
delivery 
of 
water 
of 
about 
6 
billion 
m3 
at 
the 
on-farm 
boundaries. 
This 
amount 
would 
be 
short 
of 
covering 
the 
full 
cost 
of 
O&M 
for 
the 
systems 
under 
the 
management 
of 
SAIC, and 
would 
require continued 
subsidization 
by 
Government. 
Realizing 
the 
water 
users' 
low 
ability 
to 
pay, 
the Water 
Tariff 
Committee 
set 
the payment 
level 
for 
ISF 
at 
rates 
varying 
from 
5 
to 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
calculated 
tariff, 
with 
charges 
ranging 
from 
AZM 
600 
to 
AZM 
3,000 
per 
1,000 
m3. 
The 
different 
levels 
reflect 
variations 
in 
costs 
of 
delivering 
water and 
economic circumstances. 
If 
water 
users 
would 
pay 
these 
reduced 
fees 
in 
full 
it 
would 
provide 
about 
AZM 
7 
billion 
to 
SAIC's operational 
budget, 
leaving 
a 
very 
large requirement 
for 
government budget 
to 
SAIC. 
In 
2002 
further 
changes 
were made 
to ISF 
setting, 
and 
subordinate 
legislation 
was prepared 
that 
provides 
that 
tariffs 
are 
to 
be 
set 
at a 
flat 
per 
hectare basis, 
with 
tariffs 
ranging 
from 
AZM 
4,000 
to 
-9- 
Page  14
12,500 
per 
ha. 
This 
measure 
reflects 
the 
difficulties 
in 
measuring water deliveries 
to 
the 
users. 
The 
flat 
rate 
is, 
however, 
bad 
for 
water 
management 
purposes, 
and 
does 
not 
encourage 
efficient 
use 
of 
water. 
Crops have 
varying 
water 
requirements, 
but 
collection 
for 
a 
crop 
like 
rice 
that 
might 
require 
up 
to 
10 
irrigations 
with 
in 
excess 
of 
20,000 
m3/ha 
is 
the 
same 
as 
for 
wheat 
that 
may 
only 
require 
2 
irrigations 
for 
a 
total 
of 
3,000 
m3/ha.

Since the 
introduction 
of 
ISF 
in 
1997, 
actual 
annual 
collection 
has 
ranged 
from 
about 
6 percent 
during 
the 
first 
years 
to 
90 
percent 
in 
2002 
(see 
next 
table). 
In 
few 
raions 
is 
the 
collection 
rate 
close 
to 
100 
percent. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
case 
in 
the 
six 
pilot 
farms 
under 
the 
FPP 
(see 
below). 
These 
pilot 
farms 
have 
benefited 
from 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation distribution 
and 
drainage 
systems 
and organization 
of 
water 
users. 
The 
collection 
rate 
of 
ISF 
in 
these 
pilot 
farms 
has 
reached 
levels 
that 
are 
close 
to 
the 
required 
one 
and regular 
payments 
are 
made 
to 
SAIC 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
water to 
the 
farms 
as 
agreed 
by 
contract 
between 
the 
WUAs 
and 
SAIC's 
district 
irrigation exploitation 
units.

Lack 
of 
Operation 
and Maintenance 
within 
the 
Former 
Farms. 
The 
situation 
in 
the 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms 
with 
regard 
to 
management 
and 
funding 
of 
O&M 
is 
even 
worse. 
There 
were 
about 
2,000 
such farms 
before 
Independence 
that 
had their 
own 
management organizations 
to provide 
O&M 
for 
on-farm 
systems. 
The dissolution 
of 
the 
former 
farms 
left 
a 
void 
in 
management 
responsibility, 
with 
no 
one 
having 
ownership 
of 
the infrastructure and 
no 
one 
taking 
full 
responsibility 
for 
O&M, 
or 
with 
prominent 
farmers (such 
as 
former 
fm 
managers) 
taking 
de 
facto control, 
but 
providing 
inequitable 
water 
distribution to 
farmers. 
This 
has 
been 
a 
major 
reason 
for 
irregular 
and 
inadequate 
availability 
of 
irrigated 
water 
at 
farm level 
and 
low 
overall efficiency 
of 
irrigation, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
resulting 
in 
much 
lower 
yields 
and 
profitability 
than 
could 
be 
achieved 
under 
well 
irrigated 
conditions. 
Recent 
surveys 
showed 
that around 
70 
percent 
of 
the 
farmers have 
a 
less 
than 
adequate 
water 
supply 
to 
their 
fields. 
The 
transfer 
of 
ownership 
of 
the 
on-farm 
infrastructure 
to 
SAIC 
has 
not 
been 
a solution. 
Adding 
to 
the 
agency's 
responsibilities, 
without 
substantially 
increasing 
its 
budget, 
is 
not 
a 
solution 
for 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
on-farm 
irrigation 
systems. 
It 
actually 
goes against 
common 
practice 
in 
many 
other 
countries 
where 
government 
agencies are 
gradually 
reducing 
their involvement 
in 
O&M, 
and 
concentrating 
more 
on 
policy 
and 
regulation 
setting 
and 
implementation. 
SAIC 
has 
indicated 
that 
this 
transfer 
is 
a temporary 
measure 
and that 
it 
would 
hand 
over 
management 
responsibilities 
to 
WAS 
with 
capacity 
to 
carry out 
these 
tasks. 
Inequitable and 
Unreliable 
Access 
to 
Water. 
The 
deteriorated infrastructure and the 
on-farm 
management 
vacuum 
have 
led 
to 
inadequate 
and 
inequitably 
distributed 
water 
supplies. 
In 
most 
cases, 
the 
margins 
of 
the 
systems 
are 
no 
longer 
irrigated 
and 
service 
on 
the lands 
still 
under 
irrigation 
is 
erratic. 
Influential 
farmers 
often 
receive 
priority 
access 
and 
conflicts 
are 
becoming 
more 
frequent. 
Existing 
WAS 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
resolve 
these 
issues 
due 
to 
the 
power 
of 
vested interests 
and 
lack 
of 
grass 
roots 
support.

on-farm 
irrigation 
and drainage 
systems. 
A 
start 
was 
made 
with 
the 
promotion 
of 
WUAs 
under 
the 
IDA 
and 
IFAD 
financed 
FPP 
with 
the 
main 
purpose 
to 
pilot 
the 
transfer 
of 
management 
responsibilities 
to 
associations 
of 
water 
users 
in 
six 
pilot 
raions. 
WUAs 
were 
established 
with 
command 
areas 
ranging 
from 
1,000 
ha 
to 
3,900 
ha. 
They 
perform 
a 
main 
function 
in 
allocating 
irrigation 
water 
to 
members 
in 
rotation, 
collecting 
water 
fees 
from 
users, 
and 
resolving 
water 
related 
disputes 
among 
users. 
These 
six 
WUAs 
presently 
serve 
9,383 
households 
in 
3 
1 
villages 
with 
a 
total 
area 
of 
16,942 
ha. 
Within 
the 
six 
WUAs 
a 
total 
of 
198 
Water 
Users 
Groups 
have been established, each 
with 
responsibility 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
water 
in 
a small canal 
section. 
As 
noted 
above, 
the 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
does 
not 
specify a 
framework 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
WUAs 
and 
therefore, 
the 
six 
pilot 
WUAs 
have 
been 
registered 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Justice 
as 
private 
limited 
enterprises 
under 
the 
Law 
on 
Limited Liability 
Enterprises. 
Typically, 
the 
pilot 
WUAs 
have 
a Management 
Board 
with 
a 
chairman, water management specialist, treasurer, 
and 
up 
to 
10 
water 
bailiffdfee 
collection 
agents, 
with 
the 
latter 
number 
depending 
on 
the size 
of 
the 
WUA 
area. 
There 
is 
no 
separate, 
elected 
Governance 
Council. 
Some 
of 
the 
WUAs 
do 
have 
an 
elected 
Audit 
Committee 
(normally 
3 
people) 
to 
provide 
control on 
budgets, 
and 
an 
elected 
Legal 
Committee (normally 
4 people) 
to 
provide control 
on 
the 
volumes 
of 
water 
supplied 
to 
the 
WUA 
members 
and 
on 
the 
payment 
by 
members 
according 
to 
set 
tariffs. 
Up 
to 
the end 
of 
2002, 
members 
of 
a 
management 
board 
were 
paid 
out 
of 
the 
project 
proceeds 
on 
a 
declining 
basis, 
with 
a 
25 
percent 
reduction 
annually 
after 
the 
third 
year 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
WUA. 
The 
sustainability 
of 
this 
arrangement 
has 
been questioned 
by 
SAIC 
management. 
The project 
has 
also 
provided 
training, 
equipment, 
communication 
and transportation 
facilities, 
and 
until 
recently 
has 
been 
paying 
for 
the 
operational expenditures 
of 
the 
six 
WUAs. 
FPP 
also assisted 
with 
comprehensive 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
within 
the 
WUA 
management 
area, 
at a 
cost 
ranging 
from 
US 
$220 
to 
1,070 
per 
ha. 
The 
improved 
condition 
of 
the 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
facilities 
and organization 
of 
farmers 
in 
WUAs 
had 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
the 
timely 
water 
supply 
to 
the 
farm 
fields. 
These 
factors, 
as 
well 
as 
provision 
of 
credits, are 
principal 
reasons 
for 
the 
significant 
increases 
in 
crop yields 
since 1998 
(see 
table 
5). 
During 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(M&E) 
surveys, 
WUA 
members 
have 
indicated 
that 
sustainability 
of 
the 
yield 
levels 
in 
the 
project 
farms 
will 
depend 
to 
a 
great extent 
on 
proper 
functioning 
of 
the 
imgation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
and 
timely 
availability 
of 
water 
in 
adequate 
quantities. 
A 
baseline 
survey 
for 
RIDIP 
that 
was 
carried out recently 
in 
the Samur-Apsheron and 
Kura/Araz 
areas 
found 
- 
as 
expected 
- 
that the 
number 
of 
irrigations had 
a large 
impact 
on 
crop 
yields. 
Farmers 
receiving 
more 
than 
75 
percent 
of 
the 
required 
water 
had 
wheat 
yields 
that were about 
70 
percent 
higher 
than 
farmers 
who 
received around 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
required 
water. 
The raion-level 
irrigation exploitation 
units 
of 
SAIC 
supply 
water 
to 
the 
FPP 
pilot 
WUAs 
according 
to 
norms and 
contracts 
that 
are 
concluded 
by 
the 
two 
parties 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
each 
irrigation 
season. 
At 
the 
WUA 
level, 
annual 
cropping 
plans 
and 
water 
distribution 
plans 
are 
prepared and 
contracts 
are 
concluded 
with 
farmers 
for 
water 
delivery 
during 
the 
season. 
The 
recovery 
of 
ISF for SAIC 
ranges 
from 72 
to 
100 percent, 
which 
was 
higher 
than 
the 
typical 
recovery 
rates 
outside the 
pilot 
farms 
during 
the 
period 
from 
1998 
to 
2001. 
Until 
the 
switch to 
hectare based 
water 
charges, 
i.e. 
before 
July 
1,2002, 
the 
WUAs 
charged 
their 
members 
an 
ISF 
ranging 
from 
AZM 
2,750 
to 
8,000 
per 
1,000 
m3, 
including 
AZM 
600 
to 
3,000 
for 
SAX. 
At 
present, 
ISF 
charged 
by 
the 
concerned 
WUAs 
to their 
members 
are 
fixed 
at 
the 
level 
of 
AZM 
10,325 
to 
18,438 
per 
hectare 
(including 
VAT), 
about 75 
percent 
of 
which 
is 
for 
SAIC. 
This 
seriously 
affects 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
six 
pilot 
WUAs. 
Insufficient 
hnds 
are 
available 
for 
maintenance 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
systems, 
and 
some 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
canals have 
started 
to 
silt 
up 
again. 
Water 
delivery 
per 
hectare 
continues 
to 
be 
high 
at 
8,000 
to 
12,000 
m3 
per 
ha, 
as 
modem 
methods 
for 
estimation 
of 
crop water 
requirements, 
irrigation 
scheduling and water 
management have 
not 
yet been 
-

Page  16
introduced. 
Table 
5: 
Yield 
and 
Production 
Changes 
in 
FPP Pilot 
Farms 
Under 
FPP, 
procedures 
and documentation 
were developed 
to 
provide 
guidance 
in 
the 
WUA 
establishment process. 
Normative 
documents 
were developed 
on 
creation, 
legal 
establishment, 
and 
operation. 
These 
documents have 
been approved 
by 
the 
Project 
Steering 
Committee 
of 
the Cabinet 
of 
Ministers 
and adopted 
by 
SAIC 
for 
the establishment 
and 
registration 
of 
new 
WUAs 
in 
the country. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
SAIC 
recognized that 
the FPP 
pilot 
WUA 
model 
is 
not 
fully 
replicable 
as 
the 
Government 
cannot 
at 
the 
moment 
afford 
to 
invest large 
amounts 
of 
funds 
in 
individual 
WUAs. 
Work on 
creating 
a 
large number 
of 
WUAs 
was started 
in 
2000. 
Given 
the 
limited 
amount 
of 
staff 
and 
financial 
r, 
Psources 
invested, 
the 
results 
have been impressive. 
A 
total 
of 
552 
WUAs 
have been 
legally 
established 
in 
44 
raions, 
with 
387,000 members 
and 
a 
total 
command 
area 
of 
644,000 
ha 
(45 
percent 
of 
the 
developed 
irrigation 
area). 
The 
general 
level 
of 
knowledge 
of 
the 
members 
about 
WUAs 
is 
limited 
and, 
in 
most 
communities, 
WUAs 
are 
led 
by 
people 
who 
are 
not 
accountable 
to 
WUA 
members. 
Even 
though 
WUAs 
have already 
shown 
themselves 
to 
be 
quite effective 
in 
collecting 
water 
fees, 
they 
have been 
less 
effective 
in 
informing 
general 
membership 
about 
the 
purpose 
or 
use 
of 
the 
fees, 
which 
will 
become 
increasingly important 
as 
fees 
are 
raised 
over 
time. 
A 
WUA 
is 
thus 
mainly 
seen 
as 
an 
organization 
to 
distribute 
water 
and 
collect 
the 
ISF 
for 
SAIC, rather 
than 
a genuine 
farmer-led 
organization 
with 
the 
mandate 
of 
managing 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
SAIC 
supports 
the 
establishment 
of 
WUAs 
because 
it 
simplifies 
contracting 
of 
water 
supply, 
as 
it 
can 
deal 
with 
one 
WUA 
rather than 
a 
large 
number 
of 
individual 
farmers 
in 
a 
scheme. 
Although 
understandable, 
this 
should not 
be 
the 
main 
reason 
to 
establish 
WUAs. 
In 
January 2003, 
SAIC 
established 
the 
concept 
of 
WUA 
Support 
Units. 
SAIC's 
Department 
of 
Water 
Resource Management 
and 
Water 
Fee 
Collection 
in 
Baku 
was 
given 
additional functions 
to provide 
assistance 
to 
WUA 
development. 
The 
small 
Department 
has seven 
staffing 
positions, 
three 
of 
which 
are 
vacant. 
Three 
staff 
in 
each 
of 
the 
60 
raion-level exploitation 
units 
were 
also 
given 
a mandate 
to provide 
WUAs 
with 
consultations 
on 
their 
organization and 
operation. 
None 
of 
the 
staff 
have received 
training 
on 
how 
to 
assist 
WUAs, 
except 
for 
a short seminar 
in 
Baku, where 
they 
were 
presented 
with 
some 
written 
material 
that 
was 
prepared 
under 
FPP.

Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
Remaining 
problems 
facing 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
include 
inefficient 
extension 
services 
and 
lack 
of 
credit, and 
inadequate agro-processing 
and 
marketing 
arrangements, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
irrigation 
issues. 
Tackling 
issues 
in 
isolation 
would 
not 
make 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
agricultural 
development. 
This 
would 
call 
for 
a 
broad 
project 
scope 
on 
development 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector. 
The 
project 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
complementarity 
between 
irrigation, credit 
and 
advisory 
services. 
The 
ongoing 
Agricultural 
Development 
and 
Credit Project 
(first 
phase 
of 
a 
ten 
year 
APL) 
has 
major 
extension and 
credit 
components, and 
is 
taking 
the 
lead 
in 
assisting government 
in 
agricultural 
developments. 
The 
proposed 
Rural 
Investment Project 
would 
have an agro-processing 
and 
marketing 
component, expected 
to 
invest 
in 
value-added 
agricultural 
activity 
at 
the 
community 
level. 
Considering 
these 
other 
projects, 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
irrigation 
and 
the 
need 
for 
substantial 
investments, 
a choice 
was 
made 
to 
have 
IDSMIP 
concentrate 
on 
irrigation only 
which, 
even 
by 
its 
current 
design, 
would 
be 
a 
challenging 
one 
to 
implement. 
It 
is 
very 
important, 
however, 
to 
have close 
linkages 
with 
the 
other operations 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
and 
make 
sure 
that 
project activities 
complement 
each other, 
so 
that 
as 
many 
farmers 
as 
possible 
would 
have 
access 
to credit, 
inputs 
and extension 
to 
transfer the 
more 
reliable 
water 
delivery 
into 
additional production 
and income. 
To 
achieve that, 
the 
project 
would 
work 
in 
a 
number 
of 
raions 
where 
ADCP 
is 
or 
would 
be 
working 
in 
future. 
ADCP 
currently provides 
extension 
services 
in 
three 
regions 
(including 
all 
raions 
in 
Nakhchivan), 
and 
starting 
in 
July 
2003, 
the 
information 
and 
advisory 
services 
will 
also 
be 
available 
in 
other 
raions 
(including 
Aghjabedi, 
Beylagan, 
and 
Imishli 
raions). 
ADCP 
also 
launched 
its 
credit 
program 
for 
private 
farmers 
in 
Nakhchivan's 
raions, 
with 
planned 
expansion 
to 
other regions 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2003 
(including 
Aghjabedi, 
Beylagan, 
and 
Imishli 
raions). 
ADCP 
has 
also 
conducted 
one 
information 
campaign and a number 
of 
short 
village-level 
training 
courses 
in 
water 
management, 
which 
would 
be 
expanded 
on 
by 
IDSMIP. 
The 
major 
challenges 
facing 
the 
irrigation 
and 
drainage sub-sector 
are 
to: 
(i) 
increase 
the 
participation 
of 
farmers 
in 
scheme 
management 
and 
O&M; 
(ii) 
improve 
the 
technical performance 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
to 
achieve 
higher water 
use 
efficiency 
and 
reduce 
waterlogging 
and 
salinity 
problems; 
(iii) 
increase 
water 
users' 
financial 
contributions 
for 
O&M 
of 
infrastructure 
under 
both 
SAIC 
and 
WUA 
management; 
and 
(iv) 
improve 
the 
legal 
enabling environment. 
If 
nothing 
is 
done, 
there 
would 
surely 
be a 
continued 
decline 
of 
the 
sub-sector, 
with 
deterioration 
of 
infrastructure, 
decrease 
in 
water 
deliveries 
to 
crops, 
and 
areas 
going 
out 
of 
production. 
This 
would 
have 
a 
serious 
impact 
on 
the 
livelihood 
of 
rural 
people, 
with 
few 
if 
any options 
for 
alternative employment 
for 
the 
time 
being. 
Assistance 
to 
the 
sub-sector 
is 
therefore 
needed 
to 
rehabilitate important infrastructure and 
prepare 
the 
foundation 
for 
long-term institutional 
support 
for 
a 
sustainable 
irrigation 
sector. 
If 
this 
is 
not 
done 
soon, 
the 
decline 
of 
the 
country's 
agriculture 
would 
inevitably follow, 
which 
would 
severely 
affect 
the 
employment 
base 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
The 
pilot 
farms 
under 
the 
FPP 
and 
the baseline surveys 
under 
RIDIP 
showed that a 
reliable 
irrigation 
service 
is 
directly 
linked to 
improvements 
in 
yields. 
Despite 
the 
successes 
in 
the 
FPP 
pilot 
schemes, 
it 
was nevertheless 
decided 
to 
change 
the 
legal 
status 
of 
WUAs 
from limited liability 
private 
entities 
to 
non-profit 
associations. 
The 
arguments 
for 
this 
include: 
(i) 
the 
high 
cost 
for 
supporting 
the 
FPP 
pilot 
farms, 
which 
is 
not 
sustainable; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
lack 
of 
separation 
between 
governance 
and 
management 
of 
a 
WUA, 
which 
is 
not 
conducive 
to 
engage 
all 
water 
users 
in 
decision 
making 
about 
important 
aspects 
such 
as 
equitable water 
use 
and 
management and 
reducing 
conflict 
among 
farmers 
for 
water. 
To 
establish sustainable 
WUAs 
successfully, 
the 
following 
minimum 
legal 
requirements 
are 
necessary: 
0 
a specific 
legal framework 
for 
the 
establishment 
and 
sustainable 
operation 
of 
WUAs 
that 
is 
- 
13- 
Page  18
clear and 
robust; 
clear 
legal 
provisions 
that confer 
substantive 
use 
or ownership 
rights 
to 
WUAs 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
irrigation 
systems 
that 
they 
will 
operate 
and maintain; 
clear 
and 
appropriate 
provisions 
on tariff 
setting 
for 
irrigation 
water 
supply 
both 
within 
WUAs 
and 
in 
respect 
of 
water 
supplied 
to 
them; 
and 
clear 
legal 
provisions 
that confer 
substantive 
and 
secure 
rights 
to 
WUAs 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
irrigation 
water 
to 
them.

In 
response 
to 
the 
inadequate 
legal 
basis, 
a 
set 
of 
amendments 
to 
the 
Law on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation, 
including 
a 
new 
chapter 
that 
would 
permit 
the 
establishment 
of 
WUAs 
as 
a special 
form 
of 
legal 
person 
and 
which 
also regulates 
their 
establishment and operation, 
has 
already 
been 
developed 
during 
project 
preparation.  The 
amended 
law would 
make 
the 
WUA 
a 
non-profit 
public 
association, 
with 
limited 
tax 
liability. 
Membership 
would 
be 
voluntary, and 
the 
WUA 
would 
have 
the 
legal 
right 
to 
charge 
non-members 
more 
for 
the 
service. 
The draft 
is 
now 
under 
review 
in 
Government 
and 
discussions 
with 
the 
Agriculture 
Policy 
Committee 
in 
Parliament 
have 
started. 
Problems 
with 
enacting 
amendments 
to 
a 
law 
that 
assists 
rural 
development 
in 
the 
country 
are 
not 
foreseen. 
The 
First 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister 
in 
charge 
of 
agricultural 
reform 
in 
Azerbaijan 
(who 
was 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Negotiation 
Team) also 
gave 
his 
full 
support 
to 
amend 
the 
law. 
Enactment 
is 
expected 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
2003 
autumn 
session 
on 
December 
3 
1,2003. 
With 
this 
commitment, 
the 
enactment and 
promulgation 
of 
the 
amended 
Law 
has 
been made 
a 
disbursement 
condition 
for 
Civil 
Works. 
This 
would allow 
the 
project 
to 
become 
effective 
as 
soon 
as 
possible and 
start 
with 
the 
important 
institutional 
developments. 
SAIC 
has agreed 
to 
transfer 
on-farm 
infrastructure 
to 
WUAs 
under usufruct 
arrangements 
for 
up 
to 
20 
years 
and 
renewable, and 
to 
negotiate 
long-term 
(10 
years, 
renewable) water 
supply 
contracts 
between 
SAIC 
and 
WUAs. 
These 
water 
supply 
contracts 
would 
also 
explain 
the 
rules 
for 
setting 
off-farm 
ISF. 
Several documents 
would 
be drafted 
during 
the 
next 
few 
months 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
these 
requirements, 
including 
a 
draft 
WUA 
Statute, 
an 
infrastructure 
transfer 
agreement, 
and 
a water 
supply 
contract. 
This 
would 
be 
done 
by 
SAIC 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
a consultant 
water 
lawyer. 
Of 
course, 
these 
drafts can 
only 
be 
completed after 
the 
amended 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
is 
enacted. 
In 
any 
case 
it 
would 
be 
ensured 
that 
the support 
to 
WUAs 
with 
funds 
for 
rehabilitation 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
having 
all 
necessary 
Regulations 
in 
place, 
satisfactory 
to 
the Association, and 
in 
compliance 
with 
amended 
primary 
legislation. 
It 
was agreed 
with 
SAIC 
that 
this 
would 
include 
the 
revision 
of 
Decree 
No. 
97, 
which 
limits 
the 
collection 
of 
ISF for 
use 
in 
a 
WUA 
to 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
SAIC 
fee, and, 
where 
possible, an eventual 
return 
to 
setting 
of 
SAIC-ISF 
based 
on 
volumetric 
measuring 
after 
re-instatement 
of 
hydroposts 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
The 
land 
reform 
has 
been 
very 
extensive 
and 
largely 
successful, 
but 
has 
paid 
insufficient 
attention 
to 
on-farm 
infrastructure and 
responsibility 
for 
O&M. 
Therefore 
the 
institutional 
aspects 
are 
of 
paramount 
importance 
in 
restructuring on-farm 
irrigation.  Ineffective 
as 
it 
still 
may 
be, 
there 
is 
now 
a 
positive momentum 
in 
the organization 
of 
water users 
and 
their 
empowerment 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
management 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems. 
These 
efforts 
deserve 
support 
in 
order 
to 
reverse 
the 
physical 
decline 
of 
the 
systems, 
and the proposed 
project 
would 
assist 
Government 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness, 
reliability 
and 
sustainability 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
assist 
with 
rehabilitation 
and 
improvement 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
and the 
training 
of 
and 
support 
to 
WAS, 
which would 
take 
full 
responsibility 
for 
the 
O&M 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
within 
their 
service 
territories. 
The 
lack 
of 
support 
at 
the 
moment 
limits 
the 
role 
of 
WUAs 
and 
dampens 
the 
confidence 
of 
members, 
as 
well 
as 
SAIC 
staff, 
who 
seem 
to 
underestimate 
the 
potential 
value 
of 
WUAs 
as 
partners 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
make 
the best use 
of 
national 
water 
resources. 
The 
social 
assessment 
revealed that 
people 
in 
the 
communities strongly 
feel 
the 
need 
to 
- 
14- 
Page  19
improve 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
and 
water 
delivery 
and 
see 
WUAs 
as 
a 
vehicle 
to 
address 
this 
need. 
Rehabilitation 
would 
only 
be 
worthwhile 
if 
there 
is 
adequate 
maintenance afterwards. 
Until 
recently, 
irrigation 
water 
was 
supplied 
free 
of 
charge 
to 
the 
users 
in 
the 
state 
and 
collective 
farm. 
Its 
value 
is 
still 
not 
fully 
appreciated 
by 
current 
users, 
and 
its 
delivery 
is 
often 
seen 
by 
farmers 
as 
a 
fundamental 
right, 
not 
influenced 
by 
payment. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
create 
awareness 
and 
educate 
farmers 
that 
payment 
for 
water 
delivery 
is 
a 
users 
responsibility, 
and 
it 
would 
assist 
WUAs 
to 
take 
full 
charge 
of 
the 
necessary 
O&M 
costs 
within 
their 
command 
areas. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
self-sufficiency 
budgets 
would 
be 
established, 
as 
well 
as 
plans 
to 
achieve 
the 
payment 
of 
sufficient 
fees 
to 
achieve adequate 
budgets. 
Annual 
on-farm 
O&M 
costs 
would 
vary 
from 
scheme 
to 
scheme, 
but 
have 
been estimated at 
an 
average 
of 
US 
$15 
per 
ha. 
SAIC 
has done 
a credible 
job 
in 
irrigation 
supply 
during 
the 
past 
ten 
years, 
under 
difficult 
circumstances 
and 
with 
inadequate 
budget. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
not 
be 
expected 
to 
make 
major 
changes 
to 
SAIC's 
institutional 
structure, 
but 
it 
would aim 
at 
introducing 
a 
client-driven 
approach 
in 
their 
dealings 
with 
WAS 
conceming 
the 
delivery 
of 
irrigation 
water. 
Once 
WUAs 
have 
reached 
a 
workable 
level 
of 
operation, 
they 
would 
be 
consulted 
in 
the 
process 
of 
setting 
ISF for 
the 
service 
provided 
by 
SAIC, 
which 
should 
be 
done 
through 
a 
transparent 
process, 
whereby 
the 
water 
users 
would 
pay 
the 
actual 
cost 
of 
off-farm 
O&M 
that 
would 
reflect 
the 
real 
need 
to 
provide 
the water 
delivery 
service. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
fit 
in 
the 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
the 
irrigation 
sector. 
Irrigation 
is 
a 
critical 
input 
into 
agricultural 
production, 
which 
would 
require 
strong 
agencies 
with 
adequate 
ability 
to 
properly 
operate 
and 
maintain irrigation 
infrastructure. 
SAIC 
would 
continue 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
role 
for 
the 
off-farm 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
foreseeable future, 
with 
increased 
funding 
from 
the 
users. 
As 
WUAs 
become 
stronger, 
assisted 
by 
the support 
provided though 
SAIC, 
they 
would 
gradually 
take over 
O&M 
responsibility 
for 
off-farm 
infrastructure 
as 
well, 
which 
is 
likely to 
happen 
10 
to 
15 
years 
from 
now. 
This 
would 
allow 
SAIC to 
gradually 
concentrate 
more 
on 
policy 
setting and 
oversight. 
C. 
Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a detailed 
description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a detailed 
cost 
breakdown) 
: 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
have 
two 
primary 
activities: 
(i) 
assist 
Government 
in 
building 
capacity 
in 
SAIC 
to provide training 
and 
support 
to 
WUAs, 
and 
to 
provide 
this 
training 
and 
support 
to 
WUAs; 
and 
(ii) 
assist 
in 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
improvement 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
the 
project 
would 
have 
two 
major 
components, 
while 
a smaller 
third 
component 
would 
provide project 
management support. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
support 
to 
SAIC 
offices 
in 
about 
60 
raions, 
but 
focus 
more 
comprehensively 
on 
institutional 
support 
in 
the 
1 
1 
raions 
where 
rehabilitation 
activities 
would 
take place. 
The 
following 
11 
raions 
would 
be 
covered 
Aghjabedi, 
Babek, 
Beylagan, 
Geranboy, 
Guba, 
Imishli, 
Khachmaz, Saatli, Sabirabad, 
Sharur, 
and 
Zardab. 
(The map at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
PAD 
shows 
the 
location 
of 
the raions.) 
The 
selected 
raions have 
large 
irrigation 
areas, 
and 
they 
can 
be 
linked 
to 
other donor-assisted 
interventions 
in 
the 
sector. 
Several 
of 
the 
raions 
are 
benefiting 
from 
the 
ongoing 
RIDIP, 
while 
FPP 
and 
ADCP 
are 
active 
in 
some 
of 
the 
raions 
as 
well. 
A 
recent 
Poverty 
Assessment 
Study 
found 
that 
the 
poverty 
level 
is 
quite 
similar 
across 
all 
rural 
regions 
in 
the country. 
This 
suggests 
that targeting 
specific 
regions, 
using 
poverty 
as 
a 
benchmark, 
is 
difficult. 
However, 
most 
of 
the 
11 
raions 
are 
in 
areas 
with 
an 
average 
or 
above 
average share 
of 
poor. 
Many 
people 
in 
the 
1 
1 
raions 
live 
below 
the 
poverty 
line, 
and 
generally 
lack 
adequate 
access 
to 
basic 
services 
and 
infrastructure. 
Agriculture, 
heavily 
dependent 
on 
- 
15- 
Page  20
irrigation, 
is 
the 
major 
source 
of 
income 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
rural 
households 
in 
the 
11 
raions. 
Further 
deterioration 
of 
the 
irrigation 
and drainage 
network could 
cause 
recurrent crop failure, 
which 
would 
increase 
the 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
in 
the 
project 
areas. 
Component 
1 
- 
Development 
of 
Water 
User 
Associations 
(US 
$6.95 
million) 
This 
component 
would 
include 
several 
activities, 
designed 
to 
develop sustainable 
operating 
WUAs 
in 
the country. 
It 
would 
finance technical 
assistance, goods 
and training. 
The 
technical 
assistance 
would 
be 
used 
to 
develop 
training 
and 
support plans 
for 
SAIC 
and 
WUAs, 
prepare 
training 
material, and 
provide 
training 
courses. 
Goods, such 
as 
office 
and 
training 
equipment 
and 
vehicles, 
would 
be 
provided to 
strengthen the 
agencies 
involved 
in 
the 
training 
and 
support 
of 
WUAs. 
Participating 
WUAs 
would 
also 
be 
able 
to 
source 
goods, 
including 
office 
equipment, 
motor 
bikes, 
small 
canal 
maintenance 
machinery, 
and 
field 
survey 
and 
monitoring 
equipment, 
to 
facilitate 
their 
operations. 
Training 
programs 
would 
aim 
at 
increasing 
the 
capacity 
of 
WUAs 
to 
manage 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems. 
Activity 
1: 
Development 
of 
Capacity to 
Train 
and Strengthen 
WAS 
Proper 
development 
of 
WUAs, 
with 
adequate 
member 
participation, 
would 
require 
a 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
assistance. 
In 
order 
to 
establish 
the 
institutional 
capability 
to 
develop 
in 
excess 
of 
800-1,000 
WUAs, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Government 
has 
the 
long-term technical 
capacity 
to 
support 
them, 
SAIC 
needs 
staff 
fully 
dedicated 
to 
these 
important 
tasks. 
In 
January 
2003, 
small 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
(SU) 
were 
established 
in 
Baku 
headquarters (Central-SU), 
Nakhchivan 
City 
(Nak-Center-SU), 
and 
each 
of 
the 
60 
Regional 
Irrigation 
Exploitation 
Units 
(Raion-SU). 
What 
is 
lacking 
is 
the 
experience 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
to provide 
the 
training 
and 
technical 
support 
needed 
to 
develop 
WUAs 
into 
broad-based, 
effective 
and 
sustainable organizations. 
The project 
would 
assist 
with 
the development 
of 
these 
newly 
established 
SUs. 
The 
staff 
of 
these 
SUs 
are 
civil 
servants, 
paid 
by 
SAIC. 
The project 
would 
distinguish 
between Raion-SUs 
in 
the 
11 
raions where 
rehabilitation 
activities 
would 
take place, 
and 
other 
raions. 
There 
would 
actually 
be 
12 
Raion-SUs, 
including 
two 
in 
Sabirabad 
Raion. 
The 
Baku 
Central-SU, Nak-Center-SU, 
and 
the 
12 
Raion-SUs 
would 
be 
supported 
with 
office 
and 
training 
equipment, vehicles, 
and incremental operational 
funds. 
The 
Central-SU and Nak-Center-SU 
would 
receive 
more 
training 
equipment 
to 
set 
up 
professional 
training 
rooms. 
The 
staff 
of 
the 
14 
SUs 
would 
receive 
the 
training 
necessary 
to 
implement their 
WUA 
support 
and 
strengthening 
tasks. 
For 
this, 
national and international 
consultants 
would 
be recruited 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
within 
the SUs 
to 
establish, 
train, 
support 
and 
strengthen 
WUAs. 
Considering 
the 
critical function 
the 
SUs have 
to 
play 
in 
WUA 
development 
- 
which 
would 
be 
key 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
project 
- 
the 
staff 
would 
receive a 
small 
financial 
incentive, 
in 
order 
to 
get 
their 
full 
commitment. 
This 
incentive 
would 
be 
paid 
from 
counterpart 
funds. 
The 
monthly 
compensation 
would 
range 
from 
US 
$80 
for 
a 
raion staff 
to 
US 
$200 
for 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Central-SU 
in 
Baku.  The 
cost 
tables 
that 
are 
annexed 
to 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan 
(PIP) 
reflect 
this 
government 
contribution. 
Each 
of 
the 
48 
SUs 
outside 
the immediate 
project 
area 
would 
receive a 
small allocation 
for office 
hiture 
and 
equipment. 
The 
staff 
would 
also 
benefit 
from 
basic 
training 
which 
would 
allow 
them 
to 
start 
a 
program 
of 
support 
to 
WUAs 
and 
would 
ensure 
that at 
the 
end 
of 
the project, 
the concept 
of 
WUA 
Support 
Units, 
along 
with 
the 
staff, 
would 
be incorporated 
into 
the 
SAIC 
regular 
line 
structure. 
The 
main 
tasks 
of 
the 
Baku 
Central-SU 
would 
be 
to 
develop a 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
WUA 
development, organize 
and implement 
the 
national 
WUA 
promotion 
program, 
and 
coordinate the 
WUA 
- 
16- 
Page  21
restructuring program 
and 
all 
training 
programs, 
both 
for 
the 
project 
WUAs 
and the 
larger 
set 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the country. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
support 
for 
the 
development 
and execution 
of 
the 
promotion 
and 
training 
programs. 
The 
Central-SU 
would 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
maintaining 
the 
database 
of 
all 
WUAs 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
would initially 
have 
a 
staff 
of 
up 
to 
seven 
members. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
country-wide 
training 
that 
would 
be 
provided, 
more 
staff 
may 
have 
to 
be 
added 
as 
the 
project 
progresses 
and 
the 
demands 
on 
the 
staff 
increase.  Permanent 
skills 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
the 
Central-SU 
would 
include: 
WUA 
Strengthening 
and 
Development, 
Training 
and 
Promotion, 
FinancialASF 
Management, 
and 
Database/Information Technology. 
The 
Nak-Center-SU 
would 
coordinate 
the 
WUA 
restructuring 
and 
training 
programs 
in 
Nakhchivan, 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Baku 
Central-SU. 
It 
would 
have 
three 
staff 
members, 
with 
skills 
in 
WUA 
Development, 
Training 
and Promotion, 
and 
FinanciaYISF 
Management. 
SAIC 
intends 
to 
monitor 
WUA 
performance, 
which 
the 
draft 
amendments 
to 
the 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation allow 
for.  The 
main 
functions 
would 
include 
the 
monitoring 
of 
technical, 
operational and 
financial 
performance 
of 
WUAs. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
on-farm infrastructure 
belongs 
to 
the 
State, 
SAIC 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
WUAs 
would 
need 
to monitor 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
infrastructure. 
This 
would 
be 
done 
in 
tandem 
with 
monitoring 
the 
level 
of 
funds 
collected 
by 
the 
WUA 
for 
O&M. 
Regular 
monitoring 
would 
also 
be 
carried 
out 
to 
ensure 
that 
WUAs 
conform to 
the 
set 
standards 
and that 
committees 
are 
elected 
fairly 
and operate 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
their 
constitutions. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
support 
so 
that 
these 
oversight functions can 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Central-SU 
by 
June 
30,2004. 
It 
is 
envisioned 
that there 
would 
be 
three 
staff working 
in 
each 
Raion-SU, 
namely 
an Engineer, 
Water 
Management 
specialist 
and 
WUA 
Support specialist. 
This 
staff 
would 
be 
trained 
under 
the 
project 
to 
equip 
them 
with 
knowledge and 
skills 
to provide 
technical and 
institutional 
support 
to 
WUAs. 
This 
would 
ensure 
that 
WUAs 
become 
viable 
farmer-governed 
organizations 
that 
are 
able 
to 
operate 
and 
maintain 
the 
infrastructure 
under 
their 
management 
in 
a 
sustainable way. 
The 
training 
to 
Raion-SU 
staff 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
Central-SU 
staff 
and consultants. 
Early 
during 
the 
project 
a 
Technical 
Assistance 
(TA) 
team 
would 
be 
recruited 
to 
provide 
technical 
expertise 
in 
WUA 
development that 
is 
currently 
not 
available 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
team 
would 
include 
a 
mix 
of 
long-and short-term 
consultants, 
including 
a 
WUA 
Development 
Specialist, 
Training 
and 
Promotion 
Specialist, 
Financial 
Specialist, 
Legal 
Specialist, 
and 
M&E 
Specialist. 
These consultants 
would 
assist 
the 
Central-SU 
to 
develop 
the 
WUA 
support 
program, prepare 
promotional 
and 
training 
material 
and 
train 
the trainers, 
comprising 
mainly 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Raion-SUs. 
The 
consultants 
would 
be 
housed at 
SAIC 
and 
fully 
integrate 
their 
activities 
with 
the 
staff 
from 
the 
Central-SU, 
and 
other 
related 
SAIC 
departments. 
The Central-SU 
would 
also 
hire 
several 
short-term 
national 
consultants, 
as 
and 
when 
needed, 
especially 
with 
expertise 
in 
law 
and 
community mobilization 
and organization, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
specific 
training 
skills 
to 
participate 
in 
some 
of 
the 
training 
courses, 
such 
as 
financial 
management. 
Activity 
2: 
WUA 
Strengthening 
Training 
programs 
for 
WUAs 
would 
have 
two 
components, 
one 
directed 
at sensitizing water 
users 
and 
the 
other 
directed 
at 
formal 
and 
informal 
training. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
on-demand 
support 
to 
farmers 
that 
are 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
WUAs 
through 
promotional material 
and 
workshops. 
Information 
dissemination 
would 
be 
a 
priority 
of 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
project, 
following 
traditional 
information 
transmission 
mechanisms, 
as 
well 
as 
developing 
new 
ones 
that 
ensure 
that 
all 
stakeholders 
are 
reached 
and 
able 
to 
make 
informed 
decisions 
regarding restructuring and 
development 
of 
the 
WUA. 
The 
project 
would 
also increase 
the 
awareness 
among 
local 
government 
and 
local staff 
of 
relevant ministries. 
Gaining 
support 
from 
a 
wider 
audience 
would 
contribute 
positively 
to 
the 
reforms 
proposed 
for 
the 
raions and 
the 
development 
of 
WUAs.

When 
the 
legal framework 
is 
in 
place, one 
of 
the 
first 
tasks 
of 
Raion-SUs 
would 
be 
to 
help 
all 
existing 
WUAs 
to 
restructure, 
and 
gain legal 
re-registration 
according 
to 
the 
amended 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation, 
as 
public, non-profit 
associations 
rather 
than 
private, 
for-profit 
organizations 
as 
they 
are 
now. 
The 
legislation 
proposed 
as 
part 
of 
project 
design proposes a 
new 
structure 
in 
which 
governance 
and 
management 
are separated. 
Successful 
restructuring 
of 
existing 
WUAs 
would 
require 
significant investment 
in 
public 
information, 
accompanied 
by 
a series 
of 
neighborhood-level 
discussions 
and 
public 
meetings 
in 
order 
to 
overcome the 
currently restricted 
patterns 
of 
information 
dissemination 
and 
establish 
a 
basis 
for 
replacing existing 
leadership 
with 
people 
who 
have grassroots support. 
The 
Raion-SUs 
would 
have 
funds 
to 
hire 
respected 
people 
in 
the 
WUA 
areas 
for 
short periods, 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
information 
campaign and 
development 
of 
an 
effective communication 
network 
between 
the 
users. 
The 
new 
structure 
must 
allow policy 
decisions 
to 
be 
made 
by 
the 
WUA 
Administrative 
Council 
that 
represents 
all 
the 
members. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
restructuring, 
the 
WUA 
would 
also 
receive 
the 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
under 
a 20-year 
renewable 
usufruct 
agreement. 
After 
the 
initial 
awareness campaigns, 
a 
major 
focus 
would 
be 
on 
the 
provision 
of 
strengthening 
support 
to 
WUAs, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
formal 
training, 
and 
ad 
hoc advice 
through 
regular, 
informal 
contacts 
by 
trained 
Raion-SU staff 
with 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
WUA 
members. 
In 
order 
to 
develop the 
formal training 
program, one 
of 
the 
first 
tasks 
of 
the 
Central-SU, assisted 
by 
its 
TA 
consultants, 
would 
be 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
detailed 
training 
needs 
assessment, 
building 
on 
the 
initial 
assessment 
that 
was done 
during 
project 
preparation. 
In 
areas 
such 
as 
agronomy, 
crop 
production 
and crop-water 
management, 
other projects, 
including 
ADCP 
and 
FPP, 
have 
developed 
training 
modules, 
which would 
be 
adapted 
for 
IDSMIP. 
One 
of 
the 
ADCP 
information 
campaign 
and 
training 
topics 
is 
water 
management, 
for which 
posters, 
brochures 
and 
a 
booklet 
have been prepared. 
However, 
in 
important 
areas 
such 
as 
WUA 
organization, 
WUA 
govemance, 
WUA 
conflict 
management, 
WUA 
financial 
management, 
WUA 
administration, 
and 
WUA 
O&M 
fee 
calculation 
and 
collection 
there have 
not 
been 
any 
major training efforts to 
date. 
From 
experience 
in 
other 
countries, 
these are 
the 
areas 
where 
training 
is 
most 
needed 
in 
order 
to 
develop 
competent 
and 
sustainable 
WUAs. 
Modules 
prepared 
for 
IDA 
projects 
in 
other 
countries 
would 
be 
shared 
with 
SAIC 
at 
the start 
of 
the project, 
to 
be 
adapted 
for 
use 
in 
the project. 
Based 
on 
the results 
of 
the 
training 
needs 
assessment, 
required 
training 
modules 
would 
be 
developed. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
training 
modules 
would 
be 
prepared 
on 
subjects 
such 
as: 
WUA 
formation 
and registration; 
WUA 
organization 
and 
governance, 
including 
the 
important 
role 
of 
the 
WUA 
Council; 
WUA 
administration 
and 
the 
roles 
of 
the 
various 
staff 
members; 
ISF 
and 
methods 
of 
calculating; 
irrigation 
systems 
operations 
and water allocation; 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
maintenance 
and preparation 
of 
O&M 
plans; 
construction 
supervision; 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, and 
preparation 
of 
(annual) 
reports. 
The 
project 
would 
pay 
special 
attention 
to 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
WUAs, 
which 
in 
turn 
would 
ensure 
increased 
sustainability 
of 
the 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems. 
In 
this 
respect, 
modules 
are 
likely to 
be 
prepared 
on 
topics 
such 
as: 
personnel management, 
social 
security, 
taxes, 
insurance, 
etc; 
expenditure and 
income 
planning 
and 
budgeting; 
and bookkeeping 
and 
audit 
procedures. 
Raion-SU 
staff 
would 
provide 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
WUA 
training, 
but 
some 
training 
would 
be 
best 
done 
by 
private 
companies 
or 
NGOs 
under 
contract. 
This 
might 
include 
courses 
such 
as 
training 
WUA 
Accountants, 
WUA 
Managers and 
WUA 
Administrative 
Council 
members, 
and 
courses 
in 
conflict 
resolution, procurement and 
contracting, 
and 
auditing 
techniques. 
The 
use 
of 
ADCP 
master 
training 
advisors 
to 
provide 
some 
training 
would 
be determined 
when 
the 
detailed 
training 
program 
is 
being 
prepared 
under 
the 
proposed 
project.  The 
Ministry 
of 
Justice 
has 
established a 
Training 
Center 
in 
Baku, 
which 
would 
be available 
to 
provide 
training 
in 
legal 
subjects. 
While 
the 
Training 
Center 
has 
a 
small 
resident 
staff, the 
majority 
of 
the 
lecturers 
are 
short-term 
specialists such 
as 
retired 
judges, 
lawyers 
and 
- 
18- 
Page  23
other 
experts 
in 
various 
fields, 
who could 
be 
hired 
under 
the 
project. 
ADCP 
currently 
provides 
agricultural 
information 
and 
advisory 
services 
in 
Nakhchivan 
(including Babek 
and 
Sharur), 
and starting 
in 
July 
2003 the services 
would 
also 
be 
available 
in 
Aghjabedi, 
Beylagan 
and 
Imishli. 
This 
kind 
of 
extension 
assistance 
is 
essential 
to 
increasing 
agricultural 
production. 
It 
is 
therefore 
expected 
that 
the 
relevant Raion-SUs 
would 
work 
closely 
with 
ADCP 
staff. 
The latter 
would 
also 
be 
involved 
in 
setting 
up 
several 
small demonstration 
plots 
for 
crops 
and 
cropping 
systems 
in 
the various 
agricultural 
regions, 
to 
be financed 
under 
IDSMIP. 
This 
would 
sharpen 
the focus 
on 
irrigated 
agriculture 
and 
increased 
productivity. 
The 
project 
would work 
directly 
with 
an estimated 
280 
legally 
registered 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
project 
raions 
(there 
are 
currently 
about 
240 
WUAs 
in 
these 
11 
raions, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
estimated that 
another 
40 
would 
be 
legally formed 
during 
the project). 
Out 
of 
these, 
about 
45 
WUAs, 
with 
an 
average 
command 
area 
of 
1,250 
ha 
each, 
would 
be 
selected 
for 
rehabilitation 
(see 
next 
Component). 
For 
these 
45 
WUAs, 
a 
limited 
amount 
of 
equipment 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
project. 
This 
is 
expected 
to 
include 
office 
fumiture, 
a 
computer, 
two-way 
radios, motorcycles, 
small 
canal 
maintenance 
machinery, and 
portable 
water measuring 
devices. 
The 
usefulness 
of 
each 
request 
for 
equipment 
from 
WUAs 
would 
be 
carefully 
analyzed 
by 
the 
SUs 
and 
the 
Project Implementation 
Unit 
(PIU). 
The 
benefiting 
WUAs 
would 
collect 
funds 
from 
their 
members 
for 
the 
replacement 
of 
the 
equipment. 
Raion-SUs 
would 
review 
each 
replacement 
fund 
proposal 
and 
monitor 
the 
collection 
of 
ISF for 
this 
purpose. 
Project 
staff 
themselves 
must 
fully 
understand 
the 
roles and 
functions 
of 
WUAs 
and 
what 
is 
needed 
to 
create 
viable, 
sustainable 
WUAs, 
before 
they 
are 
asked 
to 
go out 
and 
sell 
the 
concept 
to 
water 
users. 
Besides the 
in-country 
training 
program, 
it 
would 
be important 
to 
expose 
the 
main 
project 
staff 
and 
some 
WUA 
representatives 
to 
experiences 
in 
WUA 
development and 
transfer 
of 
irrigation 
management 
in 
other countries. 
It 
would 
be 
good 
to 
visit 
countries 
with 
technical 
and 
institutional 
conditions similar 
to 
those 
found locally. 
This 
could 
be 
organized 
so 
that a 
study 
group 
would 
spend 
several days 
in 
one 
WUA 
to 
get acquainted 
with 
the day 
to 
day operation 
of 
a 
successful 
WUA. 
This 
would 
provide 
insights 
to 
the 
requirements 
for 
accepting 
full 
responsibility 
for 
O&M 
and 
financial 
management 
of 
large 
service 
areas. 
A 
study 
tour 
for 
senior 
SAIC 
and project 
officials 
could 
be 
organized 
to Mexico 
and 
the US, 
where 
more 
mature 
WUAs 
can 
be 
found 
and 
are 
starting 
to 
be 
federated 
to 
take 
over responsibility 
for 
irrigation 
O&M 
upstream 
from 
the 
on-farm 
area. 
Component 
2 
- 
Irrigation 
and Drainage Infrastructure Rehabilitation 
(US 
$30.00 
million) 
During 
project 
preparation 
diagnostic 
surveys 
were 
carried out 
in 
nine 
project 
raions. 
The 
main 
technical 
findings 
of 
the 
survey 
work 
were: 
(i) 
on-farm 
systems are 
in 
poor 
condition 
with 
high 
water 
losses; 
(ii) 
canals 
are 
seriously 
affected 
by 
the 
heavy 
silt 
load 
in 
irrigation 
water 
due 
to 
non-functioning 
desilting 
at 
headworks; 
(iii) 
there 
is 
lack 
of 
operational 
hydraulic 
structures, 
and therefore 
no 
regulation 
or 
water 
measurement, 
and 
thus 
no 
incentive 
for 
efficient 
use 
of 
water; 
(iv) 
pump 
irrigation 
is 
seriously 
affected 
by 
poor quality 
of 
pumps 
and 
unreliable 
electricity 
supply; 
and 
(v) 
significant 
areas 
have 
been 
affected 
by 
salinity, 
and reclamation 
would 
be 
needed. 
In 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
WUAs, 
they 
need 
to 
have 
infrastructure 
that 
allows 
efficient 
and 
reliable 
water 
distribution, 
so 
that 
farmers 
can 
receive water 
in 
the 
right 
amount, 
at 
the 
right 
time, 
and 
at 
the 
right 
place. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
funds 
for 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and drainage 
systems. 
The project 
would 
target 
some 
280 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
selected raions, 
of 
which 
about 
45 
of 
those that 
reach 
sufficient 
maturity 
would 
benefit 
from 
rehabilitation 
investments 
(hereafter 
referred 
to 
as 
rehabilitation 
WAS 
or 
R-WUAs). 
Rehabilitation 
would not only 
be 
at 
on-farm 
level, 
as 
it 
also 
has 
to 
be 
ensured 
that water 
supply 
to 
the 
WUA 
boundaries 
is 
reliable. 
Funds 
would 
thus 
-19- 
Page  24
be 
provided for: 
(i) 
rehabilitation 
of 
on-farm 
infrastructure 
on 
about 
56,000 
ha; 
(ii) 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
Bahramtape 
headworks 
on 
the 
Araz 
River, 
which 
has 
stability 
issues 
requiring 
urgent 
attention, 
and 
which 
serves 
some 
140,000 
ha, 
including 
large 
areas 
in 
three 
of 
the 
projects 
target 
raions 
(Imishli, 
Saatli 
and 
Sabirabad); 
and 
(iii) 
rehabilitation 
of 
off-farm 
works 
associated 
with 
the 
on-farm works 
to 
ensure 
sufficient 
and 
timely 
water 
delivery 
to 
project 
WUAs. 
Off-farm 
rehabilitation 
investments, 
including 
hydroposts, 
would 
be 
restricted 
to 
about 
35 
percent 
of 
available 
rehabilitation 
funds 
to 
ensure 
that the 
bulk 
of 
investments 
are 
at 
the 
farm 
level, 
where 
the 
most 
serious 
deterioration 
has 
taken place 
during 
the 
past 
years. 
Based 
on 
various 
studies, 
it 
was 
determined 
that 
the 
average 
investment 
for 
on-farm 
rehabilitation 
can 
be 
estimated 
at 
US 
$300 
per 
ha. 
This 
would 
allow 
basic 
rehabilitation 
and 
modernization 
interventions 
to 
return 
a 
system 
to 
operational conditions.  The 
costs 
of 
rehabilitation 
works 
would 
vary widely 
across 
the 
project 
area, 
depending 
on 
the 
scale 
and 
nature 
of 
works required 
at 
each 
site. 
It 
was agreed 
with 
SAIC 
that the 
available 
funds 
would 
be 
used 
as 
efficiently 
as 
possible, 
so 
that 
the 
maximum 
number 
of 
WUAs 
can 
be 
served. 
The 
project 
would follow 
a 
program 
approach, 
where 
participating 
WUAs 
would 
be 
selected 
according 
to 
a 
number 
of 
criteria, 
including 
status 
of 
development 
of 
the 
WUA, 
training 
programs 
followed 
by 
WUA 
Council 
and 
management staff, 
and 
past 
collection 
rates 
of 
ISF 
(see 
Annex 
2). 
Rehabilitation 
plans 
would 
be 
prepared 
with 
maximum 
users 
participation. 
Typical 
rehabilitation 
works 
would 
include 
canal 
and 
drain 
cleaning, 
repair 
of 
canal 
lining, 
rehabilitation 
and construction 
of 
hydraulic 
structures, and 
rehabilitation 
of 
boreholes.  Increased 
use 
of 
weirs, 
rather than 
gated structures, 
would 
be 
an 
example 
of 
scheme 
modernization 
in 
order 
to improve 
the 
management 
of 
a 
system. 
Construction 
supervision 
and 
quality control 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
private 
engineering 
consulting 
firms, 
with 
oversight 
from 
PIU 
construction 
engineers, 
and 
WUA 
management 
staff. 
Implementation 
experience 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector 
shows 
that farmers 
participation 
in 
paying 
some 
of 
the 
investments 
is 
beneficial. 
Investments 
for 
rehabilitation 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
successful 
when 
users 
not 
only 
participate 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
rehabilitation 
requirements, 
but 
also 
provide 
a 
contribution 
to 
the costs 
of 
the 
works. 
A 
contribution 
is 
not 
so 
much important 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
actually 
funding 
the 
rehabilitation 
works, 
but 
it 
is 
an important 
mechanism 
to 
involve 
members 
of 
the 
WUAs 
in 
the 
planning 
and 
design 
of 
works 
they 
see 
as 
important, 
by 
ensuring a genuine 
dialogue 
in 
determining 
on-farm 
priorities 
and 
a 
sense 
of 
ownership. 
The project 
would 
follow 
the 
concept 
of 
farmer-driven 
development, 
a 
participatory 
process 
in 
which 
irrigators (through 
WUAs) 
identify 
their 
needs 
and 
are 
involved 
in 
decision 
making, 
implementation, 
and 
monitoring. 
During 
the 
diagnostic 
surveys 
that were 
carried out 
during 
project 
preparation, 
farmers 
expressed 
a 
willingness 
to 
contribute 
financially 
towards 
rehabilitation, 
provided 
this 
could 
be 
done 
under 
easy 
repayment 
terms, 
and after 
the 
works 
have been completed. 
It 
was agreed that the 
project 
would 
include 
a small 
percentage repayment 
of 
ten 
percent, 
with 
a 
low-fixed 
interest 
rate. 
Repayment 
of 
the 
principal 
and 
interest 
would 
start 
in 
the 
fifth 
year 
after completion 
of 
rehabilitation, 
to 
be 
recovered 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ISF 
during 
four 
years. 
The 
WUA 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
collection 
of 
the 
funds. 
Failure to 
repay 
by 
a 
water 
user, 
would 
result 
in 
sanctions 
similar 
to 
the 
ones 
imposed when 
O&M 
fees are 
not paid 
in 
time, 
i.e. 
water 
delivery 
would 
be 
stopped. 
SAIC 
would 
consider 
the 
funds 
as 
an 
ISF, 
to 
increase 
the 
funding 
for 
O&M 
in 
the 
raions where the 
funds 
are 
collected. 
The 
Bahramtape 
headworks 
distributes 
water 
from 
the 
Araz 
river 
and 
Upper 
Karabakh 
canal 
to 
four 
main 
canals 
serving 
some 140,000 
ha 
of 
irrigated 
land 
in 
five 
raions. 
The 
headworks were 
completed 
in 
1950, 
with 
only 
routine 
maintenance 
and 
minor 
repairs 
being 
carried 
out 
over 
the 
following 
forty 
years 
until 
the 
end 
of 
Soviet support 
in 
1991. 
SAIC 
recognizes 
the 
need 
for 
urgent capital 
repairs, 
but 
it 
has 
been unable 
to 
take action, 
due 
to 
budgetary 
constraints. 
There have 
been 
no 
major 
repairs 
in 
the 
past 
decade, 
and the 
headworks 
are 
now 
in 
extremely 
poor 
condition, 
with 
an increasing 
risk 
of 
-20- 
Page  25
collapse 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
major 
flood. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
the 
funds 
necessary 
to 
guarantee 
the 
safety 
and 
operation 
of 
the structure 
for 
the 
next 
decades. 
3. 
Project 
Management 
In 
order 
for 
SAIC to 
deliver 
adequate 
and 
timely 
volumes 
of 
water 
to 
the 
R-WUAs, 
the 
higher 
order 
systems 
would 
also have 
to 
be 
in 
operational condition. 
It 
would 
thus 
have 
to 
be 
ensured 
that 
main 
canal and drainage 
systems 
have 
sufficient 
capacity and 
ability 
to 
supply 
water 
to 
or 
drain 
water 
away 
from 
WUA 
areas. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
higher 
order 
systems. 
This 
would 
include 
the 
re-instatement 
of 
about 
1,000 
water measuring 
structures (hydroposts). 
The 
number 
per 
WUA 
would 
vary, 
but 
it 
has 
been 
determined that 
the 
average 
number 
is 
about 
four.  The 
construction 
of 
hydroposts 
would 
be part 
of 
the process 
of 
the 
re-introduction 
of 
volumetric 
water 
measurement, 
a 
conditionality 
of 
the 
financing 
of 
rehabilitation 
works 
for 
the 
R-WAS. 
System 
evaluation 
would 
also 
identify 
training 
needs 
of 
SAIC 
staff to improve 
the operation 
of 
systems. 
Necessary 
training 
courses 
to 
improve 
service 
and 
accountability 
would 
be 
developed, 
as 
needed.

to 
ensure 
that 
all 
works 
are 
properly 
designed and 
carried out 
with 
sufficient

Design 
and

With 
the 
similarities 
in 
implementation 
requirements 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Completion 
of 
Irrigation 
and Drainage 
Infrastructure 
Project, the 
existing PKJ 
would 
also 
be 
responsible, 
on 
behalf 
of 
SAIC, 
for 
the 
daily 
management, 
administration 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
IDSMIP. 
The 
PIU 
would 
be 
strengthened 
with 
staff 
and 
equipment, 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
project 
as 
well. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
staff 
costs, 
goods 
and

and 
part 
of 
the 
operational 
costs. 
Funds 
for 
annual 
monitoring 
and

of 
selected

areas 
would 
also 
be provided.

annual 
audit 
of 
project 
accounts

the 
implementation 
of

Plan 
would 
be 
financed 
as 
well.

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
development. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
support 
Government's 
desire 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
sustainable 
WAS 
and 
help 
them 
take 
care 
of 
the 
management 
and 
O&M 
of 
the infrastructure 
under 
their 
control.  This 
would 
facilitate 
Government's 
efforts 
to 
create a 
firm 
basis 
for 
the 
efficient 
allocation 
and 
use 
of 
water 
resources 
and 
efficient 
use 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
in 
the country. 
Over 
550 
WUAs 
have 
been 
created 
in 
the 
country, 
which 
are 
at 
a 
very early 
stage 
of 
Appropriate 
institutional 
arrangements 
would 
be 
introduced 
to 
provide 
support 
to 
strengthen 
WUAs. 
This 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
done 
through 
a 
combination 
of 
staff 
from 
government 
agencies 
and 
other 
agencies, 
such 
as 
private 
firms. 
Support arrangements 
would 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
be 
-21 
- 
Page  26
decentralized 
to 
raion 
level, to 
allow 
efficient 
decision 
making 
and 
improved 
responsiveness 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
WUAs. 
The project 
would 
incorporate 
mechanisms 
to 
assure 
that 
the 
WUA 
members 
have a 
major 
role 
to 
play 
in 
decision making 
concerning 
rehabilitation 
needs. 
They 
would 
also 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
decision 
making 
process 
for 
ISF 
setting, 
both 
for 
the 
internal 
fee 
and the 
fee 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
SAIC 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
water 
to 
the 
WUA 
scheme. 
The project 
would 
also 
ensure 
that enabling 
legislation 
is 
in 
place 
to 
allow, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
voluntary 
establishment 
of 
WUAs, 
proper 
setting 
of 
ISF, 
full 
empowerment 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the 
management 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems, 
and 
treatment 
of 
non-members 
in 
WUAs. 
The project 
would 
build 
capacity 
in 
management 
of 
investment 
projects. 
It 
would 
also increase 
the 
awareness 
of 
incorporating 
environmental and social 
concerns 
in 
project 
planning 
and 
design. 
Finally, 
it 
would 
improve 
the 
capacity 
to 
carry out 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
activities. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
of 
the country. 
The primary 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be private 
farmers, 
with 
average 
land 
holdings 
of 
2 
ha. 
A 
typical 
farming 
household 
comprises 
5 
people. 
The 
project 
would 
have 
a large geographical 
area, 
as 
it 
would 
cover 
11 
raions 
in 
several 
regions 
The 
main 
non-quantifiable 
project 
benefits 
would 
relate to: 
(i) 
institutional capacity 
building; 
and 
(ii) 
introduction 
of 
new 
concepts 
to 
change 
the 
mind-set 
among 
the 
rural 
population, 
including 
participatory 
approaches 
in 
decision-making 
related 
to 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems, 
responsibility 
for 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
systems, 
and the 
need 
to 
pay 
high 
enough 
fees 
to 
make 
this 
happen. 
This 
would 
take 
place 
in 
every 
raion 
with 
irrigation 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
would 
provide 
the foundation 
for 
sustainability 
of 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector. 
The project 
would 
provide 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
improvements 
to 
a 
total 
area 
of 
about 
56,000 
ha 
for 
45 
R-WUAs. 
The physical 
improvements, 
combined 
with 
more rational 
on-farm 
water 
management, 
would 
increase 
irrigation 
efficiencies and 
the 
timing 
and number 
of 
irrigations 
applied 
each 
season, 
with 
associated 
yield 
increases 
of 
up 
to 
45 
percent 
which 
would 
generate 
extra income 
for 
farmers.  Increased 
net 
incomes 
and 
savings 
from 
irrigation 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
O&M 
costs 
of 
the 
WUAs 
and 
a gradually increasing 
part 
of 
the 
ISF for 
SAIC. 
Off-farm 
improvements 
would 
be 
required 
to 
improve 
water 
delivery 
to 
R-WAS, 
but 
would 
benefit 
other 
irrigation 
schemes 
as 
well. 
The 
extent 
of 
these 
indirect 
benefits 
cannot 
be 
quantified 
in 
advance, 
as 
their 
nature, 
location 
and 
area 
served 
would 
be 
determined 
during 
project 
implementation.  However, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
an 
area 
of 
at 
least 
110,000 
ha 
would 
benefit indirectly, through 
a 
more reliable 
water 
supply. 
The project 
would 
also 
rehabilitate 
the 
Bahramtape 
headworks, securing 
the 
water 
abstraction 
and 
reducing 
the 
sediment 
load 
of 
irrigation 
water 
to 
about 
140,000 
ha 
in 
five 
raions, 
including 
about 
89,000 
ha 
(63 
percent 
of 
total 
command 
area 
of 
the headworks) 
in 
three 
project 
raions, 
namely 
Imishli 
(27,000 
ha), 
Saatli 
(42,000 
ha), 
and 
Sabirabad 
(20,000 
ha). 
(The other 
two 
raions 
served 
by 
the 
headworks 
are 
Bilasuvar 
(39,000 
ha) 
and 
Jalilabad 
(12,000 
ha.) 
The 
immediate 
benefit 
would 
be 
a 
reduction 
of 
at 
least 
20 
percent 
in 
the current 
sediment 
volume entering 
the 
system, 
which would 
in 
turn 
reduce 
canal 
desilting 
maintenance 
from 
around 
10 
m3ha 
to 
8 
m3ha 
per 
year. 
The 
project 
would 
reinstate 
(or install) 
sufficient 
hydroposts 
(providing 
gate 
regulation 
and 
flow 
measurement) 
to 
serve 
about 
280 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
selected 
project 
raions 
to 
enable 
volumetric 
-22- 
Page  27
measurement 
of 
water 
delivery, 
as 
would 
be 
required 
under 
the 
revised 
legislation. 
This 
would 
benefit 
both 
farmers 
and 
SAIC, 
as 
it 
improves 
the 
incentive 
to 
be 
less 
wasteful 
in 
using 
irrigation 
water. 
More 
reliable 
water 
distribution 
and 
reduction 
in 
water 
losses 
would 
increase 
water 
availability 
and 
reliability 
to 
farmers, 
allowing 
an increased 
number 
of 
irrigations, and 
thus 
provide 
scope 
to 
reduce 
the 
irrigation 
interval, 
all 
aimed at 
reducing 
crop 
moisture 
stress. 
Besides 
increased 
crop 
productivity 
and 
profitability 
attributable 
to 
a 
sufficient 
and 
reliable 
supply 
of 
irrigation 
water, 
the 
effective 
area 
under 
irrigation 
could 
increase, 
depending 
on 
potential 
and 
demand. 
Unreliable 
water 
supply 
and 
management 
has 
made farmers risk-adverse 
and 
has 
led 
to 
a 
trend 
towards 
low 
value 
subsistence crops. 
The 
main 
benefits 
would 
initially 
include 
increased 
cropping 
intensity 
and yields. 
At 
a later 
stage, 
with 
restoration 
of 
confidence towards 
growing 
higher 
value 
crops, 
crop diversification, 
and 
subsequent 
employment opportunities 
in 
processing and 
marketing 
would 
be 
achieved, 
through 
a 
comprehensive development 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector.

Project 
Duration. 
Project implementation 
is 
anticipated 
to 
take 
six 
years, 
from 
October 
2003 
to 
Implementing 
Agency. 
The 
project 
would 
be 
implemented 
under 
the aegis 
of 
the 
State 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
Committee. 
Responsibility 
for 
all 
project implementation 
tasks 
would 
be 
delegated 
to 
a 
Project Implementation 
Unit 
created 
within 
SAIC 
in 
July 
1998 
to 
implement 
RIDIP 
(SAIC 
Order 
No. 
5 
1-e), 
as 
both 
projects 
would 
have 
similar 
implementation 
requirements. 
By 
SAIC 
Order 
No. 
32-u 
of 
April 
25,2003, 
the 
PIU 
was 
officially 
entrusted 
to 
also manage 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
proposed 
IDSMIP. 
The 
PIU 
has 
been managing 
RIDIP 
satisfactorily 
for 
over 
two 
years. 
It 
reports 
directly to 
the 
Chairman 
of 
SAIC 
and 
would 
have 
direct responsibility 
for 
the 
daily 
management, 
administration and coordination 
of 
the 
proposed 
project, 
including 
procurement, 
financial 
management 
and disbursement, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
and 
reporting. Annex 
13 
provides 
a chart 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
organization. 
The 
PIU 
has 
as 
its 
core 
staff 
a 
director and 
specialists 
on 
procurement, 
financial 
management, 
environment, 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
In 
addition, 
the 
PIU 
currently 
employs 
engineers 
and 
construction 
supervisors 
for 
specific 
RIDIP 
components. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure successful 
implementation, 
the 
new 
project 
would 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
PIU 
with 
seven 
additional 
core staff, 
namely 
a 
project 
manager, 
a 
design 
engineer, three 
construction 
supervisors, 
an 
assistant accountant, 
and 
procurement specialist. 
The 
M&E 
and 
environmental 
specialists 
currently 
in 
employment 
would 
be 
working on both 
projects. 
Implementation Arrangements. 
The 
PIU 
director 
would 
have 
overall responsibility 
for 
implementation 
of 
both 
the 
ongoing 
RIDIP 
and 
new 
IDSMIP. 
The 
project 
manager 
for 
IDSMIP 
would 
have experience 
in 
institutional 
development, 
and 
would 
supervise 
DSMIP 
staff, 
but 
would 
report 
to 
the 
PIU 
director 
on 
all 
implementation 
tasks 
of 
IDSMIP. 
The 
manager 
would 
also 
have 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
the preparation 
of 
annual workplans, 
which 
would 
include 
an estimate 
of 
the 
annual 
budget 
and 
procurement and 
financing 
plans. 
The 
Engineering 
Team 
would 
ensure 
that the 
technical 
aspects 
of 
the 
engineering 
work 
are 
carried 
out 
professionally, 
and 
have 
overall responsibility 
for 
contract 
management 
and construction 
supervision, 
whether 
in 
WUA 
territories 
or 
in 
main 
systems. 
The 
Environmental 
Specialist 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
coordination 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Management 
and 
Monitoring 
Plan.

The 
PIU 
has 
developed 
the 
necessary 
experience 
and 
competence 
to 
manage 
core functions 
such 
as 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management. 
A 
procurement specialist and a 
second accountant have 
been 
hired 
to 
strengthen 
the 
PIU 
procurement 
and 
accounting 
team, 
that 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
these 
core 
activities 
for 
both 
projects.  Procurement 
and 
accounting 
staff 
would 
perform 
as 
a 
team, each 
however 
with 
primary responsibility 
specific 
either 
to 
activities 
of 
RIDIP 
or IDSMIP. 
This 
would 
allow 
to 
set 
up 
flexible 
back-up 
arrangements based 
on 
workload 
and 
ensure 
knowledge 
sharing. 
The 
M&E 
specialist 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
establishing 
the 
project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
that 
would 
allow 
the 
PIU 
to 
track 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
project 
and 
identify 
bottlenecks 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
The 
M&E 
specialist 
would 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
quarterly 
progress 
reports, 
including 
the 
compilation 
of 
the 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Report. 
A 
mid-term review 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
September 
30,2006. 
At 
least 
three 
months 
before 
that 
the 
Borrower, 
through 
the 
PIU, 
would 
prepare 
a 
mid-term 
report, 
integrating 
the 
results 
of 
the 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
activities and 
setting 
out 
the 
measures 
recommended 
to 
ensure 
the 
efficient carrying 
out 
of 
the 
project 
during 
the 
second 
part 
of 
implementation. 
A 
project implementation 
completion 
report 
would 
be 
prepared 
by 
the 
Borrower 
within 
six 
months 
from 
the 
closing 
date. 
The 
PIU 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
civil 
works 
contract 
management. 
It 
would 
contract 
out 
the 
necessary 
design 
and 
supervision 
services 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
works 
are 
properly 
designed 
and 
carried out 
with 
sufficient construction 
supervision 
and 
quality 
control. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
there 
would 
be 
one 
contract 
with 
an 
international consulting 
firm 
to 
design 
the 
rehabilitation 
works 
for 
Bahramtape 
weir. 
Another 
contract 
would 
be 
awarded 
for 
the 
design 
and supervision 
of 
the 
on- 
and 
off-farm 
works. 
It 
is 
expected 
that a 
lot 
of 
this 
work 
can 
be 
carried out 
with 
maximum local 
consulting 
firm 
participation.  The 
PIU 
would 
also 
have 
the 
option 
to 
hire 
some 
short-term 
international 
inputs 
to 
assist 
for 
example 
in 
the 
development 
of 
modem 
hydraulic 
structures. 
Sub-projects 
for 
rehabilitation 
works 
would 
be 
selected 
in 
accordance 
with 
agreed procedures 
and 
eligibility 
criteria 
and 
the 
works 
would 
be 
carried out 
in 
accordance 
with 
agreed terms and 
conditions, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
spelled 
out 
in 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement 
(DCA) 
and, 
in 
more 
detail, 
in 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan.  Disbursements 
for 
a 
particular 
rehabilitation activity 
cannot take 
place 
until 
IDA 
has 
approved a report, 
with 
the 
necessary 
technical, financial, 
legal, 
and 
institutional 
information. 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
would 
be 
maintained 
by 
SAIC 
during 
the project, 
with 
responsibility 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
WUA 
Development 
Component. 
The composition 
and 
WUA 
development 
tasks 
of 
the 
various Support 
Units 
have 
been 
described 
in 
Section 
C. 
1. 
above. 
Raion-SUs 
would 
help 
with 
the 
formation 
of 
WUAs, 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
WUAs 
to 
strengthen 
them 
and 
arrange 
training 
courses 
to 
give 
them 
skills 
needed 
to 
properly 
operate and 
maintain 
their 
irrigation 
system. 
They 
would 
also 
work 
with 
the 
WUAs 
during 
the 
rehabilitation 
phase 
and 
in 
particular, 
would 
assist 
WUAs 
in 
identification, 
design and 
supervision 
of 
works. 
Staff 
of 
the 
raion-level 
Support 
Units 
would 
be 
guided 
and assisted 
during 
the 
first 
two 
years 
by 
four 
WUA 
Mobilization 
Specialists 
and, 
in 
each 
WUA, 
by 
a 
part-time 
WUA 
Organizer 
hired 
in 
the 
community 
and trained 
in 
communications and group 
organizing 
techniques. 
Their 
main 
responsibilities 
would 
be 
to 
help Raion-SU 
staff 
develop 
skills 
and 
experiences 
in 
mobilizing 
communities, 
which 
would 
especially 
be 
critical 
during 
the 
first 
years 
when 
WUAs 
have 
to 
be 
restructured. 
Flow 
of 
Funds. 
To 
facilitate 
timely 
implementation 
of 
project 
activities, 
the 
Borrower 
would 
open 
a 
Special 
Account 
in 
the 
International 
Bank 
of 
Azerbaijan. 
In 
addition, a 
Project 
Account 
in 
local 
currency 
would 
be 
opened 
in 
the 
same 
bank 
to 
facilitate 
payment 
of 
project 
expenditures 
financed 
from 
counterpart 
funds. 
As 
a 
Credit 
effectiveness 
condition, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
would 
deposit 
US 
- 
24 
- 
Page  29
$100,000 
equivalent 
in 
the 
Project 
Account 
to 
cover early contractual obligations, 
with 
replenishments 
to 
be 
made 
as 
the amount 
is 
drawn 
down. 
The administration 
of 
the 
Special Account 
and 
the 
Project 
Account, 
including 
preparation 
of 
withdrawal 
applications 
and replenishments 
of 
the accounts, 
would 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
PIU. 
Periodically, 
as 
agreed 
between 
the 
Support 
Units 
at 
the 
participating 
11 
raions and 
the 
PIU, 
the 
PIU 
would 
transfer 
60-day 
advances 
to 
local 
bank 
accounts 
to 
be 
opened 
by 
each 
participating 
Support 
Unit. 
Typically 
the 
advance 
would 
not 
exceed 
US 
$400 
per 
Support 
Unit 
to 
finance the 
IDA 
portion 
of 
training 
and incremental 
operating 
costs. 
The 
PIU 
would 
transfer 
the money 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an estimate 
provided 
by 
the 
Support 
Units. 
These 
advances 
would 
be 
reconciled 
once 
every 
two 
months 
or 
when 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
funds 
have 
been 
utilized, 
at 
which 
time 
the 
Support 
Units 
would 
provide 
the 
PIU 
with 
receipts 
and 
estimates 
for 
the 
next 
60-days 
operational 
budget. 
Since 
the 
Borrower 
would 
be 
empowered 
to 
manage 
and 
account 
for 
funds 
which 
are 
advanced 
from 
the 
Special Account, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
that 
minimum 
safeguards are 
put 
in 
place. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that 
the 
local bank 
accounts 
be 
opened 
in 
the 
local 
branches 
of 
the 
International 
Bank 
of 
Azerbaijan 
or 
other 
commercial 
banks capable 
of 
executing 
foreign 
exchange 
and 
local 
currency 
transactions 
promptly 
and 
capable 
of 
issuing 
prompt 
monthly 
bank 
statements, 
while 
charging 
reasonable 
fees 
for 
their 
services. 
The 
PIU 
would 
have 
the 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
maintaining proper 
books 
of 
accounts 
for 
the 
project 
funds, 
allocate 
funds 
to 
the 
decentralized locations 
based 
on 
identified 
and 
justified 
implementation 
needs, 
and 
closely 
supervise 
and 
monitor 
this 
decentralized 
flow 
of 
funds. 
The 
PIU 
has already designed 
a 
standard 
reporting 
format, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
get 
consistent 
financial 
reporting 
from 
all 
the 
Support 
Units. 
The 
PIU 
would 
not 
make 
further 
advances 
to 
the 
Support 
Units 
until 
proper 
accounting 
has 
been 
received 
from 
them. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and drainage 
systems 
that 
have already 
been 
constructed. 
The 
No 
Action 
option 
would 
allow 
the 
existing 
systems 
to 
further 
degrade 
to 
a 
point 
where 
continued 
silting, 
installation 
collapse, 
and 
overgrowth 
of 
hydrophilic 
vegetation 
would 
essentially 
eradicate the 
water 
flow 
capacity 
of 
the 
irrigation 
systems. 
This 
would 
force 
most 
farmers 
to 
return 
to 
rainfed 
cropping 
patterns. 
With 
the 
high 
evaporatiodprecipitation 
ratio 
in 
much 
of 
Azerbaijans 
cultivable 
areas, 
this 
would 
spell 
the 
elimination 
of 
agriculture 
as 
a 
viable 
sector, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
areas 
that 
benefit 
from 
adequate 
precipitation 
at 
higher 
elevations 
in 
the 
foothills 
of 
the 
Caucasus 
Mountains. 
Given 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
agriculture 
sector 
to 
farmers 
income 
and 
the 
welfare 
of 
Azerbaijans 
rural 
population 
in 
general, 
and 
to 
the 
food 
security 
of 
the 
country 
as 
a whole, 
the 
No 
Action option 
is 
not 
an 
acceptable alternative. 
This 
was also 
realized 
in 
the 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty Reduction and Economic 
Development, 
which 
identifies 
public 
investment 
in 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
as 
a 
top 
priority. 
No 
Action 
Alternative. 
The 
natural 
state 
option 
does 
not 
exist, 
as 
the 
project 
concerns 
the 
Transfer 
of 
Irrigation 
Systems. 
Different 
options 
for 
the 
size 
of 
the 
command 
area 
to 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
WUAs 
have 
been 
considered. 
The 
WUAs 
could 
either 
take management 
responsibility 
for 
the 
command 
area 
of 
the 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms, 
which 
were 
well-bounded administrative 
areas, 
often 
coinciding 
with 
one 
or 
few 
lower 
order 
hydraulic 
units, 
or 
the 
management 
of 
at 
least 
part 
of 
the 
higher 
order 
irrigation 
system 
could 
also 
be 
transferred 
to 
larger 
WUAs 
andor 
federated 
WUAs. 
Considering 
the 
novelty 
of 
WUAs 
and 
users 
participation 
in 
irrigation 
management, 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
first 
of 
all 
develop 
strong and 
sustainable 
WUAs 
at the 
level 
of 
the 
former 
farm 
systems, 
the management 
of 
which 
is 
currently very 
poor. 
Only 
then should 
transfer 
of 
inter-farm 
and 
main 
systems 
be 
considered, 
which would 
also 
mean a 
considerable 
change 
in 
the 
mandate 
of 
SAIC. 
During 
the 
proposed 
project 
duration 
it 
is 
not 
advisable 
for 
SAIC 
to 
hand 
over larger-sized 
public 
infrastructure 
to 
an 
organization 
-25- 
Page  30
that 
would unlikely 
be 
capable 
of 
operating and 
maintaining 
it 
properly, 
therefore the 
option 
to 
transfer 
primary 
and 
secondary 
infrastructure 
to 
WUAs 
was 
rejected 
for 
this 
project. 
It 
would 
possibly be 
an 
important 
activity 
under 
future 
follow-up 
assistance. 
Sector Issue 
Sole 
Focus 
on 
On-farm 
Works. 
It 
was 
considered 
to 
allocate 
all 
funds 
available 
for 
rehabilitation 
to 
on-farm 
works, 
so 
that 
more 
WUAs 
could 
be 
assisted. 
Various 
surveys 
found 
that 
the 
off-farm 
system 
deterioration 
is 
considerable 
as 
well, 
which 
does 
not 
allow 
SAIC 
to 
deliver 
adequate 
volumes 
of 
water 
to 
WUAs. 
It 
was 
therefore decided that 
part 
of 
the 
available 
funds 
would 
be 
allocated 
for 
off-farm 
system 
rehabilitation 
and 
modernization. 
The project would, 
where 
possible, 
favor 
grouping 
of 
WUAs 
to 
maximize 
the 
impact 
and 
benefit 
of 
related 
off-farm 
investments. 
Off-farm 
rehabilitation 
investments, 
including 
the 
major 
headworks 
and 
hydroposts, 
would 
be 
restricted 
to 
around 
35 
percent 
of 
available 
rehabilitation 
funds 
to 
ensure 
that the larger 
share 
of 
investments 
would 
be 
at 
WUA 
level, 
where 
the 
most 
serious 
deterioration 
has 
taken place 
during 
the 
past 
years. 
Project 
Comprehensive 
Rehabilitation. 
Most 
of 
the 
irrigation 
and drainage 
systems 
have deteriorated 
considerably 
and 
could 
absorb 
major 
financial 
injections. 
A 
comprehensive 
rehabilitation 
alternative 
would 
have a 
high 
cost 
of 
up 
to 
US 
$1,000 
per 
hectare, 
which 
would 
limit 
the 
overall project 
area 
and 
limit 
the economic 
benefits.  Instead, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
focus 
on 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
infrastructure 
to 
ensure 
that 
critical 
bottlenecks 
would 
be 
taken 
out, 
so 
that 
water can 
be 
managed 
throughout the 
command 
areas 
and 
the 
maximum 
number 
of 
farmers 
could 
benefit 
from 
improved 
water delivery 
to 
the 
plots. 
Maintenance 
Equipment 
and 
Machinely. 
The inclusion 
of 
a 
major 
component 
to 
provide 
WUAs 
with 
maintenance equipment 
and 
machinery, 
at 
(close 
to) 
cost 
recovery 
level, was considered. 
This 
was 
rejected 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
(i) 
the 
WUA 
financial 
situation 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
weak 
during 
the 
first 
years, 
with 
few, 
if 
any, 
able 
to repay the 
expensive equipment 
and machinery; 
(ii) 
the 
WUA 
command 
areas are 
generally 
too 
small 
for 
a 
WUA 
to 
own 
large 
maintenance 
equipment 
and machinery; and 
(iii) 
there 
are 
small 
contractors 
in 
many 
of 
the 
raions that 
could 
carry 
out construction and 
maintenance 
works 
at 
competitive 
prices.

3. 
Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
countries 
suggests 
that a 
project should 
have 
few 
components 
and 
be 
focused 
on 
one 
or 
few 
major 
activities, 
in 
view 
of 
the country's 
still 
limited 
implementation 
and 
coordination 
capacity. 
In 
addition, 
projects 
to 
be undertaken 
in 
rapidly 
changing 
circumstances 
and 
with 
limited 
reliable information 
should 
be 
designed 
to 
be 
suitably 
flexible 
at 
implementation.  Projects 
should 
foster 
the 
understanding among 
national 
staff 
of 
the need 
to 
ensure 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
stakeholders, 
particularly 
beneficiaries, 
during 
implementation. 
For 
this 
project, 
the 
latter 
would 
be 
key 
to 
the 
success 
of 
developing 
WUAs. 
The 
proposed 
project 
has 
only 
two 
major 
components 
and 
focuses 
on 
one sector 
only. 
It 
would 
follow 
a 
program 
approach, 
which would 
give 
flexibility 
to 
make 
some changes 
in 
project 
implementation. 
Also, 
a 
well 
operating 
PIU 
is 
already 
in 
place. 
Experience 
from 
ongoing project implementation 
in 
Azerbaijan 
and other 
Former 
Soviet 
Union 
Worldwide 
experience 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector 
suggests 
that 
in 
order 
to 
get 
away 
from 
the 
irrigation 
sector's 
vicious cycle 
caused 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
investment 
and 
maintenance, 
poor 
irrigation 
service, 
water 
user 
dissatisfaction, 
low 
rates 
of 
ISF 
collection, 
resulting 
in 
even 
less maintenance, 
projects 
should 
combine a 
mix 
of 
physical 
rehabilitation 
and 
improvement, 
user 
participation, 
improved 
financial 
performance, 
and 
attention 
to 
O&M. 
Effective irrigation 
projects should be 
as 
much 
concerned 
about 
the 
policy 
and 
institutional 
aspects 
of 
a 
project 
as 
about 
physical 
infrastructure. 
Implementation 
experience 
in 
the 
imgation 
sub-sector 
- 
for 
example documented 
in 
the Bank's 
Operations 
Evaluation 
Department (OED) 
sector 
reports 
- 
shows 
that 
projects 
should: 
(i) 
help 
countries 
and 
beneficiaries make 
selective investments 
for 
rehabilitation 
and improvements, 
with 
a 
carehl 
assessment 
of 
the 
needs 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
all priority 
constraints 
to 
improved 
water 
service 
are 
being 
addressed; 
(ii) 
assist 
irrigation 
agencies 
and water 
users 
improve their 
water 
management capabilities; 
(iii) 
help 
countries 
develop 
or 
strengthen 
their 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
managing water 
resources 
and 
promoting 
user 
participation 
and management; 
(iv) 
assist 
in 
enhancing 
cost-sharing 
-27-

programs 
so 
that 
water 
users 
have 
access 
to 
reliable 
services 
and 
pay 
an 
ISF 
that 
would 
be sufficient 
to 
carry out 
adequate 
O&M; 
and 
(v) 
concentrate 
on 
management 
transfer before 
system 
improvements. 
Lessons 
from 
countries 
where 
WUA 
development 
and 
irrigation 
management 
transfer have 
taken 
place successfully 
(e.g. 
Mexico, 
which 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
best-practice) have 
shown 
that 
WUA 
support 
structures 
at 
provincial 
and 
district 
level 
facilitate 
institutional 
changes, 
especially 
when 
agencies 
work 
effectively 
with 
the 
WUAs 
as 
clients rather than 
as 
dependencies. 
Such 
WUA 
support 
units 
could 
be 
part 
of 
the 
existing 
organization 
structure 
of 
irrigation 
agencies 
or 
could 
be 
outside 
agencies, 
such 
as 
NGOs. 
Only 
if 
WUA 
development 
at 
the 
farm level 
is 
successful, 
could 
WUAs 
federate 
to benefit 
from 
economies-of-scale 
and 
take 
over 
the management 
of 
higher 
order 
irrigation 
systems. 
The 
irrigation 
agency 
could 
then 
limit 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
to 
overall 
water 
policy 
and 
planning. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
use 
the 
experiences 
described 
in 
the 
foregoing 
paragraphs, except 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
focus 
on 
development 
of 
federations 
of 
WUAs. 
This 
proposed 
project 
would 
focus 
on 
the development 
of 
WUAs 
at 
former 
state 
or 
collective 
farm 
level, 
which 
by 
itself would 
be 
a 
long-term 
process. 
Only 
after 
this 
is 
successful, 
should 
larger 
WUAs 
be 
formed 
that 
can also take 
over 
the 
management 
of 
the 
higher 
order 
(secondary 
and 
primary) 
public 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
works. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
several 
letters 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
in 
the 
SPPRED 
the 
importance 
of 
developments 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
rural 
incomes 
and 
employment opportunities. 
Agriculture 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most important 
sectors 
in 
Azerbaijans 
economy, 
and 
well 
managed 
and 
operated 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems are 
seen 
as 
important 
for 
sustained 
agricultural production.  The 
Government 
is 
highly 
committed 
to 
reforms 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
including 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector. 
This 
has 
been 
clearly indicated 
in 
the 
SPPRED. 
Government 
views 
the development 
of 
the 
non-oil 
sector 
as 
very 
important. 
It 
has 
indicated 
in 
In 
the 
policy 
letter 
of 
May 
1999 
for 
the 
Agricultural 
Development and 
Credit 
Project, the 
First 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister, 
in 
charge 
of 
agricultural 
development, 
referred 
to 
the 
need 
to 
accelerate 
the 
reform 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector. 
In 
the 
letter, 
it 
is 
stated 
that especially 
the 
systems 
within 
the 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms 
are 
deteriorating 
fast 
because 
of 
lack 
of 
adequate 
maintenance. 
As 
a 
result, 
land 
is 
going 
out 
of 
production, 
while 
the 
yields 
on 
farmed 
land 
remain low. 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
develop 
WUAs, 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
First 
Deputy Prime 
Minister, 
would 
require 
financial 
and 
technical 
support. 
As 
indicated 
in 
Section 
B, 
several 
laws and 
decrees 
have 
been approved 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
improving 
the management 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
and 
preventing 
these 
from 
too 
serious 
deterioration.  Government 
is 
now 
also 
committed 
to 
amending 
legislation 
to 
create 
an 
enabling 
legal 
framework 
for 
long-term 
WUA 
development.  Representatives 
of 
government have expressed 
their 
understanding 
of 
the 
urgency 
to 
resolve 
the 
irrigation 
issues 
in 
the 
country 
and 
to 
make the 
irrigation 
systems 
within 
the 
farms 
more efficient. 
There 
is 
a 
genuinely perceived 
need 
to 
move 
ahead 
the 
WUA 
development process 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
created 
entities 
would 
become 
financially 
and operationally 
sustainable 
in 
the 
future. 
SAIC 
headquarters 
already 
has 
now 
a 
few 
staff 
dedicated 
to 
support 
WUAs. 
At 
raion 
level 
there 
are 
also 
staff 
that 
are 
responsible 
for 
collaborating 
with 
WUAs. 
The 
First 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister 
and 
SAIC officials 
have demonstrated 
a strong 
support 
and 
commitment 
to 
the 
project. 
SAIC 
officials 
have 
provided 
substantial 
input 
in 
project 
preparation. 
Support 
of 
potential 
project 
beneficiaries 
has 
been 
strong 
during 
diagnostic 
surveys. 
The 
First 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister 
would 
provide overall 
supervision 
and 
oversight 
to 
the 
project.  The project 
is 
concemed 
-28- 
Page  33
with 
institutional 
development 
at 
the 
farm 
level, 
small physical 
rehabilitation 
of 
infrastructure and 
improvements 
in 
on-farm 
water management, 
all 
working 
towards 
improved 
agricultural 
development 
and 
production. 
It 
therefore 
falls 
well 
within 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
First 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister. 
His 
current 
responsibilities include 
the 
overall 
supervision 
of 
ADCP 
as 
well. 
Under 
the 
RIDIP, 
the 
SAIC 
has 
been 
committed 
towards 
meeting 
project 
development 
objectives 
and 
has 
consistently 
made 
significant efforts 
to 
build 
capacity 
for 
project 
implementation.  There have 
been 
no 
delays 
in 
counterpart 
funding. 
Government 
counterpart 
contribution 
for 
the proposed 
project 
have already 
been 
included 
in 
the 
state 
budget 
for 
2003. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
A 
principal 
contribution 
from 
IDA 
would 
be 
to 
bring 
in 
considerable 
world-wide 
and 
regional 
experience 
with 
the 
development 
of 
irrigation 
management 
transfer programs and 
the development 
of 
institutions 
and 
training 
programs 
to 
assist 
WUAs 
to 
become 
viable 
organizations. 
In 
addition, 
IDA 
involvement would: 
(i) 
strengthen 
SAIC's 
implementation 
capacity, 
with 
special emphasis 
on 
competitive 
procurement and 
inclusion 
of 
proper 
environmental 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
negative 
impacts; 
(ii) 
support 
institutional 
innovation 
and 
rational 
selection 
of 
schemes 
to 
be 
improved, and 
introduce 
higher 
technical 
standards, 
new 
technologies 
and 
procedures 
in 
design and 
construction (particularly 
quality 
control);  and 
(iii) 
serve 
as 
a catalyst 
for 
policy 
and 
sector 
reform.

The 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
would 
result 
from 
investments 
in: 
(i) 
rehabilitation 
of 
on-farm 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
for 
some 
56,000 
ha 
of 
service 
area 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
project 
raions; 
(ii) 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
related 
off-farm 
infrastructure 
in 
the 
1 
1 
project 
raions; 
and 
(iii) 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
Bahramtape headworks. 
In 
addition, 
components 
to 
develop the capacity 
of 
SAIC to 
train 
and 
support 
WUAs 
and 
to 
actually 
strengthen 
WUAs 
would 
result 
in 
improved 
management 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
and increased 
timeliness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
water 
supply, 
and 
would 
in 
turn 
enhance 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
infrastructural 
investments. 
Project 
costs 
result 
from 
the 
costs 
of 
infrastructure 
design, supervision, 
and rehabilitation, 
from 
the 
provision 
of 
equipment 
for 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
and 
equipment 
for 
WUAs 
themselves, 
and 
from 
the 
hiring 
of 
specialists 
and 
staff 
for 
training 
and 
overall 
project 
management. 
An 
economic analysis was 
carried 
out 
separately 
for 
the 
WUA 
rehabilitation 
sub-component, 
for 
works 
on 
the Bahramtape headworks, 
and 
for 
the 
project 
as 
a 
whole (including 
the 
costs 
of 
investments 
in 
training 
and development 
of 
WUAs, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
construction 
of 
hydroposts). 
The 
analysis 
is 
based 
on 
a 
calculation 
of 
incremental 
net 
benefits attributable 
to 
the 
project 
by 
comparison 
of 
the 
with 
project 
(WIP) 
scenario 
and 
the 
without project 
(WOP)  scenario. 
A 
sensitivity 
analysis was also 
conducted 
to 
gauge 
the 
effects 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
main 
assumptions. 
The 
analysis 
that 
was 
carried out 
for 
the 
project 
as 
a 
whole 
resulted 
in 
an 
ERR 
of 
21 
percent. 
Separate analyses 
which 
compared the benefits 
and 
costs 
of 
investments 
in 
rehabilitation 
of 
WUA 
irrigation 
infrastructure and 
Bahramtape 
resulted 
in 
EIRRs 
of 
25 
percent and 
39 
percent, 
respectively.

For 
the economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
WUA 
system 
rehabilitation 
investments, 
five 
sensitivity 
analyses 
were 
run: 
(i) 
simulating 
the effect 
of 
a 
20 
percent 
appreciation 
of 
the 
AZM 
against 
the 
US 
Dollar 
after 
2006; 
(ii) 
assuming 
no 
change 
in 
cropping pattern 
for 
the 
WIP 
scenario; 
(iii) 
assuming 
a 
cropping pattern containing 
only 
6 
percent 
high 
value 
crops (potatoes, 
fruit 
and 
vegetables); 
(iv) 
a 
combination 
of 
(ii) 
and 
(iii); 
and 
(v) 
a 
combination 
of 
(i) 
and 
(ii). 
Even 
the 
most 
pessimistic 
of 
these 
possible 
scenarios 
results 
in 
acceptable returns, 
with 
an 
EIRR 
of 
13 
percent 
(case 
(v)). 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
17.1 
million; 
FRR 
= 
21 
940 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
Financial 
analysis centers 
on 
investigating 
the 
financial 
returns 
to 
farmers 
from 
the 
improved 
irrigation 
infrastructure, and 
in 
turn 
on 
the 
sustainability 
of 
WUAs. 
The 
WUAs 
would 
be 
dependent 
on 
farmers 
capacity 
to pay 
an 
irrigation 
service 
fee 
that 
is 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
management, 
operating 
costs, 
and 
maintenance 
of 
on-farm 
irrigation 
and drainage networks, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
irrigation 
service fee 
charged 
to 
the 
WUAs 
by 
SAIC.  Currently, the 
ISF 
collected 
by 
SAIC 
finances 
less 
than 
5 
percent 
of 
SAICs 
total 
irrigation 
and drainage 
O&M 
budget. 
The 
funds 
left 
with 
the 
WUA 
barely 
cover 
WUA 
salaries, 
much 
less system maintenance. 
With 
the 
project, 
total 
WUA 
service 
fees 
would 
have 
to 
rise 
substantially 
above the 
fees 
currently 
charged 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
financial viability. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
ISF 
charged 
by 
SAIC 
should certainly 
not 
be 
reduced, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
should gradually 
increase 
(see 
also 
Sustainability 
Section). 
After 
moving 
back 
to 
volumetric 
fee-setting, 
to 
at 
least 
maintain 
SAICs 
current 
revenue 
from 
service 
fees 
a 
volumetric 
fee 
of 
about 
AZM 
2 
per 
m3 
would 
be 
required 
(current 
average 
fixed 
fee 
is 
AZM 
12,000 
per 
ha, 
while 
the 
water 
delivery 
is 
about 
6,000 
m3 
per 
ha). 
Even 
at 
this 
low 
level 
of 
ISF, 
WUAs 
would 
need 
to 
charge 
their 
members 
on 
average 
around 
7 
times 
the current 
service fee 
to 
SAIC 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
also cover 
their internal 
costs 
of 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
(estimated 
at 
US 
$15 
per ha 
on 
average), 
in 
addition to 
reimbursing 
SAIC for 
the 
ISF. 
In 
the 
long 
run, 
in 
order 
for 
SAIC 
to 
be 
able 
to 
fund 
20 
percent 
of 
its 
total 
O&M 
budget 
from 
the 
ISF, 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be 
increased 
to 
around 
AZM 
10 
per 
m3. 
Farm 
incomes 
of 
both 
middle-income 
and 
poor 
families 
were estimated 
in 
order 
to 
gauge 
the 
impact 
of 
increased service 
fees 
on 
farm 
finances. 
In 
the 
rehabilitated 
WAS, 
it 
is 
anticipated that 
systems 
would 
become 
fully 
operational, 
irrigation 
frequency 
would 
rise, 
and 
as 
a 
result 
farmers 
would 
benefit 
from 
significant 
yield 
increases. 
Analysis 
of 
a 
total 
of 
12 
farm 
models indicates that 
net 
farm 
earnings 
are 
anticipated 
to 
rise 
considerably, 
from 
US 
$100-260/family/year. 
At 
an 
ISF 
for SAIC 
of 
AZM 
2 
per 
m3, 
the 
required 
increase 
in 
WUA 
service 
fees 
would 
in 
no 
case 
exceed 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
expected increase 
in 
farm 
earnings, 
and 
in 
many 
cases 
it 
would 
be 
considerably 
lower. 
For 
middle-income families 
it 
would 
represent 
5 
percent 
or 
less 
of 
total 
cash earnings 
and 
for 
poor families 
up 
to 
18 
percent 
of 
total 
cash earnings. 
At 
this 
level, 
the 
charges 
should be 
readily 
affordable. 
Even 
with 
an eventual 
SAIC 
ISF 
of 
AZM 
10 
per 
m3, 
possibly 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the project, 
it 
would 
in 
no 
case 
represent 
more 
than 60 percent 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
farm 
earnings generated 
from 
the 
project. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
by 
US 
$35 
million 
in 
total, the 
Government 
would 
have 
to 
actually 
disburse 
an 
estimated 
US 
$4.1 
million 
in 
counterpart 
funds 
during 
project 
implementation. 
About 
US 
$900,000 
of 
expenditures 
on 
the 
project 
would 
return 
to 
Government 
coffers 
in 
the 
form 
of 
taxes, 
resulting 
in 
a 
net 
increase 
in 
government 
expenditures 
of 
US 
$3.2 
million 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
project. 
Because 
farmers 
are 
currently

land 
tax, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
proposed that 
WAS 
would 
be 
exempted 
from 
taxes 
as 
well, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
there 
will 
be an 
increase 
in 
Government 
cash 
inflow 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
expected 
increase 
in 
agricultural 
production. 
However, 
with 
the 
increases 
in 
oil 
revenues 
expected 
over 
the 
next 
decade, 
it 
should 
be 
feasible 
for 
Government 
to 
cover the 
additional 
expenditures 
related 
to project 
implementation. 
According 
to 
the 
2002 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
for 
Azerbaijan, 
"rapid 
development 
of 
the 
oil 
sector 
in 
Azerbaijan 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
an increase 
in 
fiscal 
resources 
available 
to 
the Government." 
Total 
Government revenues 
are 
expected 
to 
increase 
from 
AZM 
6,748 
billion 
in 
2002 
to 
AZM 
19,229 
billion 
by 
2010, 
with 
budget 
surpluses 
predicted 
beginning 
in 
2006. 
Currently 
the 
supply 
of 
irrigation 
water 
is 
funded 
almost 
entirely 
by 
contributions 
from 
the 
State 
budget. 
Irrigation 
service 
fee 
revenues have 
contributed 
less 
than 5 
percent 
to 
SAIC's 
total 
operational 
budget. 
Excluding 
O&M 
of 
pumps 
and 
wells, the 
fees 
cover 
only 
about 20 percent 
of 
current 
expenditures 
on 
off-farm irrigation 
system maintenance. 
Total 
Government 
budgetary allocations 
for 
O&M 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
have 
amounted 
to 
about 
AZM 
150 
to 
170 
billion 
(US 
$30.6 
to 
34.8 
million) 
annually 
over 
recent 
years 
(this 
includes energy/electricity 
and 
pumping, 
but 
does 
not 
include 
SAIC 
expenditures 
not 
directly 
associated 
with 
farm 
irrigation, 
such 
as 
for flood 
protection 
works 
or 
forestry irrigation). 
However, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
this 
figure 
would 
have 
to 
be 
more than 
doubled, 
to 
at 
least 
AZM 
350 
billion 
(US 
$71 
million), 
in 
order 
to 
adequately 
cover the 
required 
O&M 
expenditures. 
Expenditures 
through 
SAIC 
are 
the 
major 
channel 
of 
Government 
support 
to 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
(equivalent 
to 
2.7 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
State 
budget 
expenditure 
in 
2001) 
and 
for 
maintaining 
levels 
of employment 
in 
the economy. 
To 
date, 
about 
two 
thirds 
of 
the budget 
allocation 
has 
been 
directed 
to 
operating 
and 
maintaining 
pumps. 
The 
design 
and 
age 
of 
the 
pumps 
are 
such 
that 
efficiencies 
are 
low, 
and the 
erratic 
power 
supply 
exacerbates 
repair 
requirements. 
The 
high 
operational 
cost 
has 
been 
justified 
in 
order 
to 
support 
livelihoods 
in 
rural 
communities 
which 
have 
virtually 
no 
non-agricultural 
employment opportunities. 
Through 
the 
introduction 
of 
volumetric 
service 
fee 
charges, 
to 
be 
increased 
gradually, the actual 
cost 
of 
providing 
water can 
be 
calculated, 
and 
hopefully 
the 
efficiency 
of 
pumped 
systems 
improved. 
The 
project 
should 
not, 
of 
itself, 
incur 
great increases 
in 
either 
water 
abstractions/pumping 
or 
in 
other 
O&M 
costs. 
However, 
additional 
funding 
would 
be 
required 
to 
maintain 
the 
off-farm 
systems 
in 
the 
future, 
particularly 
if 
pumping 
continues 
to play 
a 
major 
part 
in 
the 
irrigation 
systems 
of 
the 
country. 
3. 
Technical: 
SAIC 
has 
sufficient high-quality 
staff 
at 
raion 
level, 
and 
has done 
a 
credible 
job 
during 
the 
past 
ten 
years 
in 
managing 
water, 
considering 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
has 
not had 
enough 
O&M 
budget 
for 
many 
years 
now.  The 
fact that 
off-farm irrigation 
systems 
are 
also 
deteriorating 
is 
not 
so 
much 
due 
to 
the 
technical 
capacity 
of 
SAIC, 
but 
is 
mainly 
a 
financial 
issue. 
There 
is 
confidence that 
when 
the 
financial 
situation 
of 
the agency 
improves, 
it 
will 
be 
able 
to 
properly 
operate 
and 
maintain irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
mainly 
finance 
rehabilitation 
works 
and 
some 
modernization. 
The 
implementing 
agency's 
strength 
is 
in 
planning 
and 
maintaining 
irrigation 
and drainage 
infrastructure, 
and 
the 
works 
that 
would 
be 
implemented 
would 
unlikely 
present 
technical 
difficulties. 
As 
an 
example, 
under 
FPP and 
DIP 
the 
technical 
issues 
were generally 
well 
covered. 
SAIC 
and 
its 
PKJ 
have 
experience 
in 
supervising 
consulting 
firms 
that 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
actual 
design 
and supervision. 
SAIC staff 
and 
local 
consultants have 
gained 
experience 
during 
preparation 
in 
conducting 
diagnostic 
surveys, 
which 
included 
walk-throughs 
to 
identify 
scope 
of 
works 
that 
are 
priority, 
cost 
-31 
- 
Page  36
effective 
and 
economically justified, 
and that 
would, 
where 
possible, reduce 
future 
maintenance tasks 
and 
costs. 
This 
kind 
of 
investigation 
would 
be carried 
out 
for 
the 
project 
WUAs 
as 
well. 
During 
preparation, 
attention 
was 
also 
given 
to 
proper costing 
of 
unit 
rates, 
and 
the cost 
estimates have 
been 
based 
on 
actual 
rates 
used 
by 
private 
contractors 
under 
various projects.  There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
local 
contractors 
that 
would 
be 
able 
to 
carry out many 
of 
the 
works 
expected under 
the 
project. 
A 
number 
of 
these 
contractors have 
carried out 
contracts 
under 
FPP, 
and 
have 
generally 
performed 
satisfactory. 
Important 
would 
be 
to 
provide 
independent 
construction 
supervision 
and 
quality 
control, 
which 
has 
been 
built 
into 
the 
project. 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
agency 
is 
the State 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
Committee, 
which would 
implement 
project 
activities 
through 
its 
line 
departments 
and 
the 
PIU.  Under 
the 
ongoing 
RIDIP, 
the 
SAIC 
has 
gained relevant 
project implementation 
experience. 
SAIC 
management 
is 
committed to 
the 
project 
and 
has 
clear 
understanding 
of 
its 
objective and 
scope. 
SAIC 
has 
generally 
capable, 
experienced engineering 
staff 
at 
raion 
level, 
which 
have 
shown 
considerable 
interest 
in 
the 
activities 
proposed, 
and 
have 
actively 
participated 
during 
project 
preparation.  However, 
it 
is 
fundamentally 
an engineering-based 
organization 
with 
a residual 
supply-driven 
approach 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
well 
adjusted 
to 
the 
demand-driven 
approach that 
is 
proposed 
for 
the 
IDSMIP. 
Although 
hundreds 
of 
WUAs 
have 
been 
established 
with 
the 
support 
of 
SAIC, 
its 
experience 
with 
WUA 
development 
remains 
very 
limited 
and 
is 
based 
largely 
on 
old 
top-down 
methodology. 
Small 
WUA 
Support 
Units, 
established 
at central 
and 
raion 
levels, 
lack 
experience 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
with 
development 
of 
WUAs 
as 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
community 
organizations. 
These 
weaknesses 
would 
be 
addressed 
by 
recruitment 
of 
technical 
assistance 
of 
experienced 
specialists 
in 
the 
field 
of 
WUA 
development, finance, 
and group 
promotion 
and 
formation. 
The 
consultants 
would 
integrate 
their 
activities 
with 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Central-SU through 
on-the-job training. 
Formal training 
activities 
and 
study 
tours 
planned 
under 
the 
project 
would 
further 
enhance 
the 
knowledge 
of 
SAIC 
and 
WUA 
Support 
Unit 
staff. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Unit, 
reporting 
to 
the 
SAIC 
Chairman.  Created 
under 
the 
RIDIP, 
the 
PIU 
has 
developed 
the 
necessary 
experience and competence 
to 
manage 
IDA-financed 
projects. 
It 
has 
participated pro-actively 
in 
the 
project 
preparation 
and 
has 
clear understanding 
of 
the 
implementation 
arrangements 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
PIU 
is 
currently 
fully 
staffed 
with 
national 
experts. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure successful 
implementation 
of 
IDSMIP, 
the 
PIU 
would 
be 
strengthened 
with 
additional 
staff, 
as 
described 
in 
Section 
C. 
Required 
engineering 
capacity 
would 
be 
addressed 
by 
inclusion 
of 
teams 
of 
international and national 
engineering 
consultants 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
civil 
works 
envisaged 
by 
the 
project 
are 
properly 
designed and 
carried out 
with 
sufficient construction 
supervision 
and 
quality 
control. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
A 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Review 
(CPAR) 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
early 
2002. 
The 
comprehensive 
assessment 
of 
the 
public 
procurement 
system 
included 
the 
legislative 
framework, the 
effectiveness 
of 
regulatory institutions, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
enforcement 
regime, 
the 
capacity 
of 
its 
institutional 
and 
human 
resources, 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
corruption. 
The 
CPARs 
key findings, 
including 
risk 
assessment, 
the 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
public 
procurement 
system 
and a proposed 
action 
plan 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
report 
issued 
in 
June 
2002. 
The 
CPAR 
concluded 
that 
while 
an 
appropriate 
and 
Basic 
institutional 
arrangements 
relating 
to 
the 
IDSMIP 
are 
already 
in 
place. 
The 
executing 
Day 
to 
day 
management 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Project 
Implementation

competent 
regulatory 
framework 
is 
in 
an 
advanced 
state, 
capacity and 
resources 
of 
the 
procurement 
system 
remain 
weak.  Based 
on 
this 
analysis, 
the 
environment 
for 
conducting 
public 
procurement 
in 
Azerbaijan 
is 
assessed 
as 
a 
medium 
to 
high 
risk 
from 
a 
procurement 
point 
of 
view. 
The 
CPAR 
analyzed 
also the 
quality 
of 
the 
governments conduct 
of 
IDA-financed 
procurement 
in 
terms 
of 
adherence 
to 
fiduciary 
requirements 
and 
identified 
the 
following main 
problems 
affecting 
efficient 
procurement: 
(i) 
while 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
policy 
on 
taxation 
and 
custom 
duties 
for 
IDA-financed 
projects, 
the 
processes are 
not 
always 
known 
to 
tax 
and customs 
officers, and 
there 
is 
no 
clear 
procedural 
arrangements 
in 
place 
on 
how 
to 
apply the 
policy; 
and 
(ii) 
there 
are 
problems 
with 
technicalities 
of 
bid 
securities, and 
local 
banks 
are 
not familiar 
with 
issuing 
bid 
securities 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
requirements. 
An 
Independent 
Procurement 
Audit 
of 
five 
IDA-financed 
projects 
in 
Azerbaijan 
(not 
including 
RIDIP),  conducted 
in 
May 
2002, 
identified 
the 
following 
common 
operational 
issues 
related 
to 
procurement: 
(i) 
lack 
of 
procurement 
planning 
resulted 
in 
ad 
hoc 
procurements, 
non-competitive 
procurement 
methods, 
resulting 
in 
high 
prices; 
(ii) 
insufficient 
procurement 
expertise and 
capacity 
in 
project 
PIUs, 
specifically 
with 
respect 
to 
conducting 
NCB 
and 
ICB; 
(iii) 
poor 
contract administration, 
especially 
of 
works 
contracts; 
and 
(iv) 
poor 
procurement 
record 
management. 
During 
the preparation 
of 
IDSMIP 
an 
updated procurement capacity 
assessment 
of 
the 
PIU 
was 
carried 
out. 
Based 
on 
this 
assessment, 
it 
is 
concluded 
that the 
capability 
of 
the 
PIU 
has 
been 
substantially 
built-up 
by 
the 
ongoing 
RIDIP. 
The 
projects 
procurement 
implementation 
capacity 
has 
been 
rated 
as 
Average 
risk, 
as 
it 
is 
not 
facing many 
of 
the 
issues 
and 
problems 
identified 
at 
country 
and 
project 
audit 
level.  Under RIDIP, 
the 
PIU 
has 
developed 
into 
one 
of 
the 
better 
performing 
procurement 
units, 
with 
adequate 
procurement 
management 
capacity and 
experience, 
and 
with 
familiarity 
with 
IDA 
procurement 
rules. 
It 
has 
performed 
satisfactory 
with 
the 
procurement 
of 
works, 
goods and 
consulting 
services 
using 
appropriate procurement 
methods. 
Most 
of 
the procurement 
actions have 
been 
reviewed 
by 
IDA 
supervision missions 
and 
no 
major 
problems 
were 
identified. 
Procurement under the proposed 
project 
would 
include 
mainly 
civil 
works, 
both 
ICB 
and 
NCB. 
In 
addition, 
there 
would 
be 
some 
goods procurement, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
mainly 
through 
ICB 
and 
International 
Shopping. 
Consultants 
would 
be 
hired 
through 
QCBS 
for 
larger 
packages, 
e.g. 
for 
design 
and supervision and 
WUA 
development, 
while individual 
consultants 
would 
also 
be 
hired 
for providing 
training to 
WUAs. 
Local 
firms 
would 
be 
recruited through 
Consultants 
Qualifications 
for 
smaller 
activities 
such 
as 
M&E 
studies 
and 
some 
of 
the 
SU 
training. 
The 
PIU 
has 
experience 
with all 
these 
methods 
of 
procurement and therefore 
no 
major 
issues 
that 
require 
special 
attention 
are 
anticipated. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
anticipated 
increase 
of 
workload, 
an action 
plan 
has been prepared 
to 
strengthen 
PIUs 
capacity 
to 
administer procurement 
under 
IDSMIP 
in 
an 
effective 
and 
transparent way. 
This 
plan 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
6. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
preparation and updated at 
appraisal. 
The 
existing 
PIU 
that 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
project 
financial 
management, 
including project 
accounting, 
reporting, 
administration 
of 
the 
Special Account and 
auditing 
arrangements, has 
developed 
sufficient 
capacity 
and 
experience 
in 
implementing 
IDA 
projects, 
having 
implemented 
the 
ongoing 
RIDIP. 
The existing 
financial 
management arrangements 
are 
considered 
adequate 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the proposed 
project. 
The 
ongoing 
project 
is 
already 
producing 
quarterly Project Management Reports 
(PMRs) 
that 
would 
be 
customized 
to Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
for 
the proposed 
project.  The 
FMRs 
would 
be 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
reports 
required 
under Section 
4.02 
of 
the 
legal 
agreement 
under 
the 
proposed 
IDSMIP. 
A 
financial 
management 
assessment 
was 
carried out 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
during 
project 
-

Page  38
The 
audit 
would 
be 
carried out 
by 
independent 
auditors 
in 
accordance 
with 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
(ISA) 
promulgated 
by 
the 
International 
Federation 
of 
Accountants 
(IFAC), 
and 
under 
terms 
of 
reference acceptable 
to 
the 
Association. 
The 
annual 
audit 
report 
including 
audited 
project 
financial 
statements, 
the 
Special 
Account 
and 
Statements 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOEs) 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
Association 
within 
six months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year.  Based 
on 
the 
satisfactory performance 
of 
the auditors 
for 
the 
ongoing 
RIDIP, 
and 
for 
consistency 
and 
economic 
efficiency, 
it 
was agreed 
to 
use 
the 
same 
auditors. 
The 
CY 
2000 and 2001 audits 
for RIDIP 
were 
carried 
out 
well 
by 
the 
auditor, and 
did 
not 
reveal any 
problems 
with 
accounting. 
The draft 
Country Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
Report 
(CFAA) 
dated 
January 2003 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
public 
financial 
management that 
require 
strengthening. 
The 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(SAC-2) 
will 
facilitate 
policy 
dialogue 
in 
improving 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
the 
public financial 
management, 
reducing 
conflict 
of 
interest and 
corruption 
in 
the 
business 
environment, 
and 
strengthening 
the 
banking 
sector.  These 
activities, 
including 
modernization 
of 
treasury operations 
and strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Accounts 
and 
strengthening 
the 
commercial 
banking 
sector, 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
ongoing 
IDA-financed Institutional 
Building 
Technical 
Assistance 
Credit 
(IBTA-2) 
and the 
Financial 
Sector 
Technical 
Assistance 
Credit, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
support 
from 
IMF, 
EU 
and 
USAID. 
The 
Country 
Portfolio 
Performance 
Review 
(CPPR) 
of 
January 
2002 
identified 
common 
financial 
management 
issues 
affecting implementation 
of 
IDA-financed 
projects. 
A 
Worlung 
Group 
was 
established 
to 
ensure 
common 
issues 
are 
appropriately 
addressed 
(delays 
in 
approving legal 
documents 
by 
the 
Government, arrears 
in 
counterpart 
funding 
and 
financing 
of 
duties 
and 
taxes). 
Within 
its 
Indicative 
Program 
for 
2004-2006, 
the 
EU/TACIS 
will 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
introduction and application 
of 
international 
accounting 
standards 
in 
the country. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
At 
the request 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Azerbaijan, 
the 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) 
assembled 
a 
multi-disciplinary 
team 
of 
international 
and 
national environmental 
experts 
to 
conduct 
the 
environmental 
assessment 
(EA) 
and 
prepare 
the 
environmental 
management 
and 
monitoring 
plan 
(EMMP).  The 
EA 
team 
had 
missions 
in 
Azerbaijan 
in 
June, 
September, 
and December 
2002, 
and 
February 
2003, 
to 
gather 
the 
baseline 
information 
for 
the 
EA, 
visit 
the 
various proposed 
project 
areas, 
view 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
conditions, and meet 
with 
national 
and 
local 
officials, 
representatives 
of 
non-governmental 
organizations, 
water 
user 
associations, farmers, 
and 
other 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project. 
During 
the February 
mission 
the 
EA 
team 
conducted 
public 
consultations 
in 
Baku 
and 
in 
Sabirabad 
with 
officials, 
NGOs, and 
project 
beneficiaries 
on 
the 
draft 
ENEMMP. 
Environmental 
Category: 
B 
(Partial 
Assessment) 
The 
EA 
confirmed 
the 
Category 
B 
designation 
for 
the 
project, 
finding 
no 
significant, 
irreversible, cumulative 
or 
long-term 
adverse 
impacts. 
In 
fact, 
the 
EA 
identified 
a number 
of 
positive 
impacts 
of 
the 
project 
(such 
as 
reduction 
in 
water 
losses, 
waterlogging 
and 
soil 
salinity; 
and 
enhanced 
water 
resources 
management). 
Potential 
negative impacts that were 
identified 
could 
be 
effectively 
prevented 
or 
reduced 
through application 
of 
appropriate 
preventive 
actions 
or mitigation 
measures. 
The 
potential 
negative impacts 
are 
described 
in 
Annex 
11, 
which 
presents 
the 
Executive 
Summary 
of 
the 
EA. 
The 
EA 
also 
confirmed 
the 
application 
of 
the 
safeguard 
policies 
on 
projects 
on 
international 
waterways 
and 
safety 
of 
dams, 
and 
examined 
but 
rejected application 
of 
the 
safeguard 
policies 
for 
natural 
habitats 
and 
pest 
management 
to 
the 
project. 
Finally, 
the 
EA 
determined that 
the 
project 
does 
not 
trigger 
any 
of 
the 
remaining 
safeguard 
policies 
involving 
forestry, 
cultural 
property, indigenous 
peoples, 
involuntary 
resettlement 
or 
projects 
in 
disputed 
areas.

Although 
finding 
no 
significant 
adverse 
impacts 
from 
the project, 
the 
EA 
nevertheless 
recommended 
the 
following 
preventive 
and 
mitigative 
measures, 
supported 
by 
environmental 
monitoring, 
to 
address 
the 
few 
potential 
negative 
impacts 
identified: 
(i) 
environmental 
management 
guidelines 
and 
appropriate site 
management 
plans 
to 
minimize 
any 
damage 
caused 
by 
contractors 
during 
construction 
activities 
and 
ensure 
proper 
disposal 
of 
excavated sediment and 
coqtruction 
waste; 
(ii) 
proper 
management 
practices 
and 
water 
quality 
and 
quantity 
monitoring to 
address 
the 
potential 
decrease 
in 
water 
quality and 
risk 
of 
reduction 
in 
ecological 
flow; 
(iii) 
technical 
assistance 
to 
promote 
improved 
water and 
soil 
management 
practices 
to 
prevent any 
potential 
waterlogging, 
salinization, 
or 
erosion 
of 
soils; 
(iv) 
phasing 
of 
rehabilitation activities 
in 
sensitive 
areas 
and ecological 
monitoring 
to 
detect 
any 
potential 
adverse 
changes 
in 
the 
hydrology 
of 
sensitive 
wetlands; 
(v) 
extension 
services 
in 
environmental 
health 
practices 
and 
monitoring to 
prevent any 
increase 
in 
water-related 
diseases; 
(vi) 
technical 
assistance 
to 
strengthen water management 
practices 
by 
WUAs 
in 
order to 
minimize 
water 
user 
conflicts; 
and 
(vii) 
extension 
services 
in 
integrated 
pest 
and 
production 
management 
to 
reduce any 
potential 
future 
agro-chemical 
pollution 
resulting 
from 
increased 
use 
of 
fertilizers 
or 
pesticides. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The 
EMMP 
identifies: 
(i) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
review 
procedures; 
(ii) 
capacity-building 
and 
training 
activities; 
and 
(iii) 
environmental 
monitoring 
programs that 
would 
be 
undertaken 
during 
project implementation 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
environmental 
and 
social 
management 
principles 
and 
practices 
identified 
by 
the 
EA 
are 
incorporated 
into 
project activities 
and that 
any 
potential 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts 
are 
either 
prevented 
or 
minimized.  The 
EMMP 
has 
been 
fully 
budgeted, 
with 
an 
estimated 
allocation 
of 
about 
US 
$300,000 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the project. 
Environmental 
Screening 
and 
Review 
of 
Sub-Projects. 
The 
demand-driven nature 
of 
the 
project 
means 
that the 
exact 
number 
and 
location 
of 
the 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation 
sub-projects 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
project 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
determined.  Therefore, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
appropriate 
preventive actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
applied 
to 
specific 
sub-project 
rehabilitation 
sites 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis, 
the 
EMMP 
includes 
environmental 
screening 
and 
review 
procedures. 
The 
objective 
of 
these 
procedures 
is 
to review 
the 
individual 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation 
sub-projects 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
identifying 
and 
addressing 
(preventing 
or minimizing) 
the 
site-specific 
potential 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts. 
Where 
potential 
impacts 
identified 
through 
this 
process 
are 
minor, they 
would 
be 
addressed 
using 
the 
appropriate preventive actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
specified 
in 
the 
EA. 
More 
significant 
impacts 
may 
require additional 
review 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Ecology 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
and 
implementation 
of 
specifically 
identified 
preventive 
actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures. 
Capacity 
Building 
and 
Training. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
proper implementation 
of 
the 
environmental 
screening 
and 
review 
procedures 
and 
resulting preventive 
actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures, 
the 
project 
would 
include 
capacity 
building 
and 
training 
for 
environmental 
assessmentlmanagement 
through 
training 
of 
PKJ 
and 
SU 
technical 
staff. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
short-term 
national 
and 
international 
experts 
to 
deliver 
a 
range 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
on 
environmental 
issues 
to 
PIU 
management 
and 
staff 
and 
to 
central 
and 
field 
office 
staff 
in 
SAIC. 
The 
PIU 
would 
employ an 
environmental 
specialist 
to 
perform 
environmental oversight 
functions 
for 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
also 
would 
ensure 
that 
WUAs 
participating 
in 
the 
rehabilitation 
component 
of 
the 
project 
each 
designate an 
environmental counterpart 
to provide 
a 
point 
of 
contact 
for 
the 
PIU 
environmental 
specialist, 
raise environmental 
awareness 
within 
the 
WUA, 
and 
ensure 
that 
environmental 
measures are 
observed 
in 
execution 
of 
any 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation works 
within 
the 
areas 
managed 
by 
the 
WUAs. 
Environmental 
Monitoring 
Program. 
The 
project 
would 
monitor 
the 
environmental and social 
indicators 
identified 
in 
the 
EAS 
analysis 
of 
preventive 
actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures. 
The 
purpose 
in 
monitoring 
these 
indicators 
is 
to 
determine, 
to 
the extent 
possible, 
the 
direct and 
indirect 
environmental 
-

and social 
impacts 
of 
project activities 
and, 
where 
necessary, 
make 
appropriate 
corrections to 
project 
activities 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
or 
lessen adverse 
impacts. 
For 
example, 
under 
RIDIP, 
the 
PIU 
began 
an 
ecological 
monitoring 
program 
for 
the 
important 
lakes and 
wetlands 
in 
the 
project 
area 
(Lakes 
Ag-gel 
and 
Sarisu). 
This 
monitoring 
would 
be 
continued 
under 
the 
new 
project, 
as 
needed. 
Further, 
the 
PIU 
would 
administer 
and 
coordinate 
as 
necessary 
with 
SAIC, 
the 
MENR, 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health (MoH) 
the 
additional 
monitoring 
activities 
identified 
in 
the 
EMMP. 
The 
PIU 
environmental 
specialist 
would 
supervise these 
environmental 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation functions 
for 
the 
project 
and 
contract 
additional 
technical support 
as 
needed. 
The 
EMMP 
is 
considered 
part 
of 
overall project 
implementation 
and 
would 
be 
annexed 
to 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan. 
The 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement 
has 
a 
covenant 
requiring 
execution 
of 
the 
EMMP 
by 
the 
Borrower.  The 
PIU 
would 
report 
on 
EMMP 
implementation 
in 
its 
regular 
project 
reporting 
to 
the 
IDA, 
and supervision 
missions 
would 
evaluate progress 
in 
its 
implementation. 
5.3 
For

projects, 
timeline 
and 
status 
of 
EA: 
Date 
of 
receipt 
of 
final 
draft: 
March 
3,2003 
The 
EA 
report 
has 
been translated 
in 
Azeri 
and 
is 
publicly 
available 
in 
SAIC. 
The 
Association 
was 
informed 
in 
a 
formal 
letter 
from 
SAIC 
of 
March 
20,2003  that the 
EA 
report 
can 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Infoshop, 
which 
was done 
the 
same 
day. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Ecology 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
carried out an 
Environmental 
Expertise. 
The 
official 
written 
response 
of 
April 
19,2003 
was 
positive 
and 
the 
EA 
and 
EMMP 
were 
approved. 
The project 
would 
be 
fully 
supported 
by 
the 
MENR. 
5.4 
How 
have 
stakeholders been 
consulted at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental 
impacts 
and 
proposed environment 
management 
plan? 
Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups 
were 
consulted? 
Environmenlal 
Screening. 
The 
EA 
team began 
the 
process 
of 
consulting 
the relevant 
stakeholders 
and 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project 
during 
its 
three 
environmental 
screening missions. 
It 
held 
meetings 
with 
officials 
in 
the SAIC, 
the 
MENR, 
the 
MoH, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
(MOA) 
and 
other 
national 
institutions; 
with 
local 
SAIC 
officials 
and 
WUA 
officers 
and 
members 
in 
a number 
of 
the 
project 
area 
raions; 
with 
representatives 
of 
national 
environmental and 
social 
NGOs; 
and 
with 
farmers 
and other 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
field. 
The 
list 
of 
stakeholders 
met 
during 
the 
environmental 
screening process can 
be 
found 
in 
Annex 
D 
of 
the 
ENEMMP 
report. 
Draft 
EA/EMMP. 
The 
EA 
team 
continued 
and 
expanded 
the 
consultation 
process 
during 
its 
fourth mission 
with 
more 
formal, 
publicly 
announced 
meetings 
in 
Baku 
and 
in 
Sabirabad 
with 
stakeholders 
and 
beneficiaries 
on 
the 
findings 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
draft 
ENEMMP. 
The 
Baku 
consultation 
included 
government 
officials 
from 
the 
SAIC, the 
MENR, 
and the 
MOA, 
as 
well 
as 
representatives 
from 
a number 
of 
national 
NGOs. 
The 
regional consultation 
in 
Sabirabad 
included 
a 
large number 
of 
local SAIC 
officials, 
WUA 
members, 
and 
local NGOs 
from 
a 
number 
of 
the 
project 
raions. 
The detailed 
minutes 
of 
these 
meetings 
and 
lists 
of 
participants 
are 
also 
contained 
in 
Annex

of 
the 
EAEMMP. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have 
been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
As 
noted 
above, 
the 
PIU 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
administering 
and 
coordinating 
the 
monitoring 
program 
for 
the 
environmental and social 
indicators 
identified 
in 
the 
EAS 
analysis 
of 
preventive 
actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures. 
The 
EMMP 
includes a 
detailed 
and 
fully 
costed 
monitoring 
program. 
Monitoring 
these 
indicators 
should 
allow 
the 
PIU 
to 
determine 
the 
direct 
and 
indirect 
environmental and

social impacts 
of project activities 
and, 
where 
necessary, 
take appropriate actions 
or 
make 
corrections 
to 
project activities 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
or 
lessen 
any 
adverse 
impacts 
detected.

Social: 
6.1  Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
Preparation 
of 
the 
IDSMIP 
made 
use 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
and baseline 
survey 
for 
the 
IUDIP, 
and 
included 
a social 
diagnosis, 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
the 
multi-sectoral 
diagnosis 
of 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farms 
(now 
WUA 
areas). 
The 
findings 
are 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
12. 
This 
section 
provides 
a 
synopsis 
of 
major 
points 
that 
emerged 
from 
the preparation 
activities 
and 
discusses 
implications 
for 
the 
project. 
RIDIP 
Social 
Assessment. 
The 
social 
assessment 
for 
IUDIP, 
carried out 
in 
late 
1999, 
included 
two 
large 
irrigation 
zones 
in 
the 
Samur and 
KurdAraz 
areas, 
in 
which 
a 
survey 
was 
conducted 
of 
1,600 
households 
and 
staff 
of 
about 
400 
different 
entities 
(farms, 
non-agricultural 
and 
state 
enterprises, 
etc.). 
It 
was designed 
to 
understand a 
number 
of 
issues: 
(i) 
problems 
with 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
and 
the 
contribution 
of 
unsatisfactory 
water 
supply 
to 
low 
agricultural 
production; 
(ii) 
the 
extent 
to which 
the 
reluctance 
of 
water 
users 
to 
pay 
for 
water use 
is 
related 
to 
the 
unreliability 
of 
irrigation 
service 
and 
inadequacy 
of 
supply, 
as 
well 
as 
ability 
to 
pay; 
(iii) 
the 
extent 
to which 
water 
users 
feel 
the 
need 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
and 
water management; 
(iv) 
the 
willingness 
of 
water 
users 
to 
organize themselves; 
and 
(v) 
level 
of 
interest 
of 
users 
to 
take 
responsibility 
for 
system 
management. 
The 
results 
revealed 
that: 
(i) 
the 
principal 
problems 
with 
the 
existing 
irrigation 
systems 
supplies 
are 
unreliable 
and 
inadequate supplies and 
poor 
and 
deteriorating 
drainage; 
(ii) 
farmers 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
pay 
for 
better 
service; 
(iii) 
farmers 
are 
willing 
to 
be 
organized, 
but 
feel 
that 
they 
don't 
have 
the 
skills 
to 
organize; 
and 
(iv) 
farmers 
want 
to 
have 
more responsibility 
for 
decisions 
that 
affect 
their 
livelihood. 
RIDIP 
Baseline 
Survey. 
The 
RIDIP 
baseline survey, 
carried out 
in 
2002, 
included 
a 
random 
selection 
of 
485 
households 
in 
the 
two 
areas, 
including 
55 
control 
households 
outside 
the 
project 
areas. 
The 
survey 
focused 
primarily 
on 
agricultural activities 
and 
household 
budgets. 
Findings 
were 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
the 
earlier work, 
refined 
by 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
impact 
on 
yields 
of 
reduced water 
supplies. 
IDSMIP 
Social Diagnosis. 
The 
Social Diagnosis 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
six 
WUAs 
that were 
assessed 
by 
a 
multi-disciplinary 
specialist 
team. 
In 
each 
site, 
the 
Social 
Diagnosis 
consisted 
of 
key 
informant 
interviews 
of 
officials 
of 
local 
self 
government, 
SAIC 
and 
the 
WUA; 
nine 
focus groups 
on 
different 
topics 
with 
different 
members 
of 
the 
communities; a 
series 
of 
Participatory 
Rapid 
Assessment 
exercises; 
and 
fifteen 
household 
interviews 
in 
a 
stratified 
sample. 
Among 
the 
principal 
findings 
of 
the 
Social 
Diagnosis 
are 
the 
following: 
(i) 
economic 
stratification 
is 
becoming more prominent 
in 
the 
WUA 
areas, 
based 
on 
access 
to 
well-irrigated 
land, 
among other 
factors; 
(ii) 
for 
the 
most part, 
the 
WUAs 
established 
over 
the 
last 
two 
years 
are 
led 
by 
members 
of 
the 
old 
state 
and 
collective 
farm 
management 
cadre; 
(iii) 
farmers have accepted 
the 
WUA 
concept 
but 
see 
them 
as 
administrative, rather 
than 
representative organizations; 
(iv) 
the incidence 
of 
payment 
of 
water 
tariffs 
has 
increased 
markedly 
and 
most 
farmers 
say 
they 
are 
willing 
to pay 
higher 
tariffs 
if 
they 
receive 
better 
irrigation 
service; 
(v) 
nonetheless, 
as 
much 
as 
35 
percent 
of 
WUA 
members 
in 
some 
communities 
may not 
be 
able 
to 
sustain 
much 
higher 
tariffs, 
at 
least 
until 
after 
they 
benefit 
from 
improved irrigation 
service; 
(vi) 
the 
level 
of 
information 
available 
to 
WUA 
members 
is 
very 
limited 
and 
directed 
only 
to 
male 
heads 
of 
household; 
(vii) 
the 
relationship between the 
WUA 
and 
local 
self-government 
is 
ambiguous, 
but 
not 
necessarily 
problematical; 
(viii) 
the 
status 
of 
Internally 
Displaced 
People 
(IDP) 
is 
ambiguous 
within 
communities 
and, 
despite 
the 
fact that they 
are 
irrigation 
water 
users, 
IDPs 
are 
virtually invisible 
to 
WUAs; 
and

successful 
restructuring 
of 
existing 
WUAs 
along 
the 
lines 
envisioned 
in 
the 
project 
would 
require 
a 
major, 
sustained 
information 
campaign that 
reaches 
neighborhoods 
and 
individual 
households. 
Social 
Issues 
Based 
on 
the 
social 
analysis and other 
preparatory work, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
five 
social 
issues are 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
- 
poverty, equity, 
empowerment, 
gender, 
and social 
inclusion 
- 
either 
directly 
or 
indirectly. 
They 
would 
be 
addressed 
in 
the 
project 
through various 
means. 
Poverty. 
This 
is 
not 
a 
targeted, 
or 
focused 
poverty 
alleviation 
project, 
as 
such. 
Rather 
it 
would 
contribute 
to poverty 
reduction 
as 
an 
inclusive 
operation, that 
affects a 
broad group 
of 
people, 
increasing 
economic 
opportunities; and 
as 
an 
enabling 
operation 
that 
promotes 
local 
institutions 
that 
empower 
irrigated 
farmers and 
enhance 
their 
economic security. 
The 
target 
population 
includes 
all 
farmers 
with 
land 
in 
the 
irrigated 
areas 
of 
former 
farms 
in 
selected regions. 
The 
relative impact 
on 
different 
people 
would 
be 
marked, however.  Those 
who 
would 
benefit 
most 
are 
farmers 
on 
the 
margins 
of 
the system 
whose 
access 
to 
water 
has 
declined 
as 
the 
systems 
deteriorated.  These 
farm 
families 
receive 
no 
water 
or 
limited 
and 
irregular 
service, 
causing 
them 
to 
obtain 
limited 
yields 
or 
lose 
crops, 
depending 
on 
the 
extent 
to which 
they 
actually 
receive 
water. 
Some 
marginal 
areas 
have gone 
out 
of 
production 
or 
switched 
to 
rainfed 
crops, 
in 
the 
areas 
with 
best 
rainfall. 
The 
people 
who 
farm 
these 
areas 
are 
either 
already 
impoverished 
or 
suffer 
declining 
incomes 
as 
the 
situation 
worsens; 
rehabilitation 
would 
enable 
them 
to 
reverse 
this 
downward 
spiral.  Farmers 
in 
more 
favorable 
parts 
of 
the 
system 
also 
suffer 
from 
deteriorated infrastructure and 
poor 
water 
distribution 
management; 
physical 
and 
management 
improvements 
would 
reduce 
uncertainty 
and 
enable 
them 
to 
increase 
their 
incomes, 
as 
well. 
The 
recent 
baseline survey 
for 
the 
RIDIP 
demonstrated 
that 
farmers 
who 
receive 
adequate 
water 
supplies 
obtain 
average 
wheat 
yields 
of 
farmers three 
times 
as 
high 
as 
the farmers 
who 
get 
half 
of 
their 
water 
requirements. 
Equity. 
The 
privatization 
and 
restructuring 
of 
former 
farms 
aimed 
to 
distribute 
land 
assets 
equitably, based 
on 
a 
lottery 
system. 
Differences 
in 
land 
quality, location, 
family 
size, 
and 
farming 
skills 
inevitably 
were translated 
into 
a 
widening 
spectrum 
of 
family 
incomes. 
The 
discrepancy between 
high 
and 
low 
incomes 
was 
exacerbated 
by 
inequitable 
access 
to 
water, 
however, 
due 
both to 
a 
vacuum 
in 
the 
management 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
and 
preferential 
access 
of 
former 
managers 
and 
other 
influential 
people. 
The 
social 
diagnosis 
revealed 
a 
common perception 
that 
the 
new 
WUAs 
hastily 
created 
over 
the 
last 
two 
years are 
dominated 
by 
a 
few 
farmers whose 
interests 
are 
given 
priority. 
The 
project 
would 
promote equity 
by 
helping 
to 
develop strong 
WUAs 
that 
are 
accountable 
to 
all 
of 
the 
membership.  Once 
they 
are 
able 
to 
guarantee 
equitable 
access 
to 
water, 
the 
WUAs 
would 
enable 
all 
capable farmers, 
not 
just 
the large and 
influential 
farmers, 
to 
improve 
their 
economic 
status. 
Empowerment. 
The 
impact 
of 
the 
privatization 
of 
former 
farms 
has 
been mixed. 
Most 
members 
of 
the 
former 
farm 
communities, 
including 
those 
not 
engaged 
in 
agriculture, 
welcomed 
the 
opportunity 
to 
have 
access 
to 
land 
to 
use 
for 
their 
own 
purposes, 
or 
lease 
to 
others. 
They 
soon 
discovered, 
however, 
that 
their 
aspirations were 
stymied 
by 
limited 
skills, 
as 
well 
as 
limited 
access 
to 
inputs 
ranging 
from 
technical 
information to 
regular water 
supplies. 
As 
systems 
deteriorated, 
access 
to 
water 
became 
more 
unreliable 
and 
inequitable, 
increasing 
both 
disparities 
and 
disillusionment. 
Respondents 
in 
the 
RTDIP 
social 
assessment 
strongly 
supported 
the 
idea 
of 
creating 
WUAs, 
but 
felt 
that 
they 
themselves 
were 
unable 
to 
create 
them. 
Consequently, 
SAIC's 
effort 
to 
create 
WAS 
met 
this 
need and 
was 
rapidly 
accepted. 
The 
many 
WAS 
that 
resulted 
from 
this 
top-down 
approach 
are 
limited 
in 
scope 
and 
competence and administrative, 
rather 
than 
representative; consequently 
they 
have 
little 
grass-roots 
support. 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
empower water 
users 
on 
two 
levels: 
first, 
by 
restructuring 
and 
providing 
support 
to 
WUAs 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
be 
autonomous, representative, competent 
and 
accountable 
to 
their 
-

members, 
and 
to 
operate 
efficiently 
and transparently; 
and 
second, 
by 
instituting 
long 
term 
SAIC-WUA 
contracts 
to 
make SAIC 
responsible 
for 
meeting 
its 
water 
delivery 
obligations. 
These 
steps 
are 
necessary 
but 
not sufficient 
for 
sustainable 
agriculture 
in 
Azerbaijan, 
thus 
the 
project 
would work 
in 
areas 
where 
other 
projects 
are 
in 
place 
to 
address 
other constraints. 
Gender. 
The 
social 
diagnosis 
of 
sample farms 
focused 
on 
the 
influence 
of 
gender 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
land 
and 
property 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
economically viable 
farming 
units, 
particularly 
those 
owned 
by 
female-headed households. 
The 
diagnosis 
concluded that 
the 
impact 
of 
privatization, 
in 
general, was greater 
on 
women than 
men, 
as 
women 
were 
the 
first 
to 
lose 
jobs 
due 
to 
downsizing, 
but 
gender 
differentials 
appear 
to 
be 
negligible 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
distribution 
of 
farm 
assets. 
Indeed, 
informal 
mechanisms 
emerged 
among extended 
families 
to 
help 
female-headed households 
manage 
their 
lands. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
social 
diagnosis 
revealed 
that 
information 
networks 
of 
women 
are 
much 
more 
limited 
than 
those 
of 
men, 
particularly 
regarding 
institutional 
changes, 
such 
as 
the 
creation 
of 
WAS, 
and 
their 
implications 
for 
increased water 
tariffs, 
and 
agricultural 
technologies. 
The 
project 
would 
thus 
target 
women 
as 
well 
as 
men 
in 
various 
information 
dissemination 
efforts 
in 
order 
to 
ensure that 
all 
members 
of 
the 
community 
are 
informed 
about 
the 
project 
and 
WUA 
activities,  especially 
those 
which 
have an 
impact 
on 
the 
family 
economy. 
Social Inclusion. 
The social 
diagnosis 
revealed 
growing 
economic 
polarization 
in 
the 
subject 
communities, 
significantly 
exacerbated 
by 
differential 
access 
to 
water 
based 
on 
influence 
and economic 
status. 
Until 
they 
receive 
reliable 
water 
supplies, 
as 
many 
of 
one-third 
of 
water 
users 
may 
be 
unable 
to 
pay 
increased service 
fees. 
This 
would 
present 
a 
challenge 
to 
WUAs 
that 
need 
to 
be 
sustainable, 
yet 
serve 
all 
water 
users, 
including IDPs 
and 
marginal 
farmers whose 
vulnerability 
is 
related 
to 
social factors 
and the 
location 
of 
their 
farm 
plots. 
First, 
WUAs 
that 
ensure 
equitable 
access 
to 
water 
can 
not only 
reduce 
economic 
polarization 
but 
also 
eliminate 
many 
of 
its 
consequences 
that 
take the 
form 
of 
social 
exclusion. 
This 
would 
not 
entirely 
eliminate 
the 
need 
for 
each 
WUA 
to 
decide 
up-front 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
members 
who 
are 
really too poor 
to 
pay 
increased service 
fees 
in 
an equitable, 
socially inclusive 
manner, 
however. 
Second, 
WUAs 
that 
effectively 
recognize 
the 
importance 
of 
all 
stakeholders, 
including 
IDPs, 
and integrate 
them 
into 
their 
activities, can 
,significantly 
increase 
the 
level 
of 
communication 
between 
IDPs 
and 
other 
members 
of 
the 
community and help bridge 
the 
gaps 
of 
the 
relative 
isolation 
that 
was 
described 
in 
the 
2002 
Poverty 
Assessment. 
Social 
Development 
Outcomes 
The 
anticipated social 
development outcomes 
of 
the 
project 
are 
related 
to 
the 
issues 
discussed 
above. 
Decreased 
Poverty. 
The 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
enhance 
the 
incomes 
of 
irrigated 
farmers 
by 
increasing 
the 
reliability 
of 
irrigation 
water 
delivery 
through 
improvements 
in 
water 
distribution 
and 
management 
by 
restructured, strengthened 
WUAs 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
physical 
infrastructure. 
All 
farmers 
are 
expected 
to benefit, 
but 
those 
who 
would 
qualitatively 
benefit 
the 
most 
are 
the 
farmers whose 
lands 
are 
located 
in 
marginal 
areas 
and 
currently suffer 
from 
the most unreliable, 
inadequate 
water 
delivery. 
Increased 
Equity. 
SAIC 
and 
WUAs 
are 
now 
most 
responsive 
to 
the needs 
of 
large and 
influential 
farmers. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
restructure 
and 
strengthen 
WUAs 
to 
separate 
governance 
and 
management, 
to 
make 
them 
representative 
and 
accountable, 
and 
to 
increase 
their 
managerial 
and 
technical 
competence. 
This 
would 
ensure 
that 
all 
water 
users 
receive equitable 
access 
to 
water and 
the 
needs 
of 
all 
members 
are 
met.

Empowerment 
on 
Different 
Levels. 
Through 
project 
interventions, farmers 
would 
be 
empowered 
to 
exercise 
their 
skills 
productively 
under 
reliable 
irrigation 
regimes, 
enabling 
them 
to 
increase 
their 
production and 
incomes and 
to 
pay 
reasonable 
water 
service 
fees. 
Strong, accountable 
WUAs 
would 
be 
empowered 
to 
manage 
the 
on-farm 
irrigation 
systems 
effectively 
and 
efficiently to 
serve 
all 
farmers, 
and 
to 
demand 
that 
SAIC 
deliver 
the water 
supplies 
for 
which 
they 
have contracted 
and 
paid. 
SAIC would 
be 
empowered 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
traditional 
functions 
adequately 
and 
efficiently, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
new 
WUA 
support 
function. 
Gender Equity. 
The 
project 
would 
greatly 
enhance 
the 
level 
of 
information 
available 
to 
members 
of 
farm 
communities, 
WUAs 
and 
SAIC 
field 
staff. 
It 
would 
disseminate 
available materials and develop 
new 
materials 
and new information 
channels, 
as 
needed, 
to 
ensure 
that 
both 
men 
and 
women 
get the 
information they 
need 
for 
WUA 
families 
to 
make 
informed 
decisions 
regarding 
WUAs, 
water 
management 
and irrigation 
service 
fees. 
Increased 
Social Inclusion. 
Informed 
membership and 
representative, accountable 
WUA 
leadership 
would 
promote 
social 
inclusion 
by 
reducing 
economic 
disparities 
caused 
by 
inequitable 
access 
to 
irrigation 
water; 
enforcing 
rules 
and regulations 
equally 
on all 
members 
to 
eliminate 
suspicions 
of 
privileged 
treatment; 
developing 
consensus 
on 
ways 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
poor 
WUA 
members, 
such 
as 
cross-subsidies, 
if 
appropriate; and 
including 
IDPs 
as 
active 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
WUA, 
reducing 
their 
marginal 
status 
and increasing 
the 
level 
of 
communication 
between 
them 
and other 
members 
of 
the 
community. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The project 
affects 
four 
distinct 
stakeholder 
groups, 
three 
of 
which 
have 
recognizable 
SUb-grOUpS. 
WAS. 
This 
can 
comprise a 
number 
of 
sub-groups, 
depending 
on 
the 
system: 
prominent 
members, 
characterized 
as 
"business 
farmers" 
in 
the Social Diagnosis; regular 
members; 
invisible 
members, such 
as 
IDPs 
and women; and managers. 
Each 
of 
these 
groups were 
consulted 
during 
project 
preparation, 
both 
directly 
through 
the 
diagnostic 
process, 
and 
indirectly 
through 
various 
field 
discussions. 
WUAs 
are 
the target 
units 
of 
the 
project, 
thus 
they 
would 
be 
directly 
involved 
in 
implementation, 
as 
well. 
Eligibility 
for 
rehabilitation 
funding 
would 
be 
based 
on 
demand 
and 
WUA 
performance, 
thus 
the 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
empower 
WUAs 
and 
strengthen 
their 
capacity 
to 
operate 
effectively. 
SAIC. 
The 
agency 
includes 
three 
sets 
of 
stakeholders 
who 
have been engaged 
in 
project 
design 
and 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
implementation: 
staff 
in 
headquarters 
had primary 
responsibility 
for 
project 
design 
and 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
implementation; 
one 
set 
of 
field 
staff 
in 
regional offices 
with 
responsibility 
for 
operating 
major 
structures, 
helped 
identify 
rehabilitation 
and 
reconstruction 
needs 
and 
would 
oversee 
the design 
and 
construction 
of 
the 
major 
infrastructure 
investments; 
and 
staff 
of 
the 
new 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
in 
raion 
offices 
would 
be 
supported 
as 
they 
define 
their 
new 
roles 
and 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
carrying them 
out. 
Local 
self-government. 
Officials 
of 
local 
self-government 
have 
participated 
in 
many 
discussions 
about 
the 
project, 
both 
in 
field 
visits 
and, 
more 
systematically, 
during 
the 
diagnostic 
exercise. 
They 
have 
helped 
developing 
the 
project 
design 
through 
their 
insights 
regarding community 
structure and 
function 
and 
would 
act 
as 
silent 
partners 
during 
implementation. Meanwhile, 
as 
WUAs 
become stronger 
and 
more 
autonomous, 
they 
would 
each 
develop 
predictable 
relationships 
with 
local 
self-government, 
defining 
respective roles, 
responsibilities 
and 
boundaries.

Page  45
Contractors. 
At 
least 
four 
sets 
of 
contractors 
would 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
project: 
first, 
engineers 
who 
design 
and 
supervise 
major 
works; 
second, 
civil 
works contractors 
who 
handle 
major 
civil 
works; 
third, 
engineers 
who 
advise 
WUAs 
and 
help 
them 
develop 
rehabilitation 
plans 
and 
supervise 
construction; 
and 
fourth, 
civil 
works 
contractors 
who 
carry 
out on-farm 
the 
rehabilitation 
works. 
The 
roles 
of 
the 
first 
two 
groups 
are 
standard 
ones 
and 
need 
no 
elaboration. 
The 
latter 
two 
groups 
- 
engineers 
who 
advise 
WUAs 
and 
on-farm 
contractors 
- 
would 
be 
given 
special 
instructions 
or 
training 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
understand 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
and 
are 
prepared 
to 
work 
directly 
with 
WUAs 
as 
advisors and partners, even 
if 
SAIC 
issues 
the contracts. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Environmental 
Assessment 
and were 
invited 
to 
comment 
on 
the 
final 
draft 
EA 
report, 
as 
well 
as 
attend 
public 
discussions 
of 
EA 
findings 
and recommendations. 
Various 
NGOs 
were 
consulted 
during 
project 
preparation. 
There 
are 
no 
active 
NGOs 
in 
the 
irrigation 
sector, 
or 
with 
relevant 
experience 
in 
project 
monitoring, 
thus 
consultations 
were 
brief 
and 
it 
is 
not 
anticipated that recognized 
NGOs 
would 
have a 
major role 
in 
implementation. 
In 
essence, 
the 
institutional objective 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
to 
develop 
viable, 
sustainable, representative 
WUAs 
that 
function 
as 
civil 
society 
partners 
with 
SAIC 
in 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources, 
thus 
civil 
society 
involvement 
is 
key 
to 
the 
project. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements have 
been 
provided to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
for 
restructuring 
and strengthening 
WAS, 
a 
key 
element 
of 
project 
design 
and 
implementation. 
The 
principle 
mechanisms 
for 
achieving 
this 
are 
the 
newly-established 
raion-level 
WUA 
Support 
Units, 
which would 
provide training 
and 
technical 
support, 
as 
well 
as 
conduct 
information 
campaigns 
to 
help 
WUA 
reach 
all 
members 
and 
increase 
their 
transparency 
and accountability. 
To 
launch 
their 
work, 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
in 
project 
raions 
would 
benefit 
from 
the advice 
of 
WUA 
Mobilization 
Specialists, 
located 
in 
the 
PIU 
Regional 
Field 
Units, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
efforts 
of 
part-time 
WUA 
Organizers 
hired 
in 
each 
community. 
The latter 
would 
have an 
especially 
important 
role 
of 
helping 
the 
WUA 
develop 
an 
agenda 
that 
addresses 
management 
and social responsibilities 
of 
the 
WUA, 
to 
complement 
the 
technical 
agenda 
that 
deals 
with 
physical 
infrastructure. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
basic 
monitoring 
unit 
for 
social 
development outcomes 
is 
the 
WUA. 
The project 
would 
work 
intensively 
with 
WUAs 
in 
11 
raions. 
In 
each 
of 
these 
raions, 
some 
WUAs 
would 
eventually be 
eligible 
for 
rehabilitation 
support, based 
on 
criteria related 
to 
the 
functioning 
of 
the 
WUA. 
Each 
WUA 
would 
carry out a 
multi-discipline 
diagnosis, 
patterned after 
those 
undertaken 
during 
project 
preparation. 
The 
staff 
of 
the 
Support 
Units 
would 
help 
WUA 
members 
carry out 
the social 
diagnosis, 
which would 
be 
used 
to 
develop 
a 
social/management 
agenda 
that 
clearly 
identifies 
relevant 
social 
issues 
in 
the 
WUA 
area, 
assesses 
their 
implications 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
WUA, 
sets 
appropriate objectives (social 
development outcomes) 
and 
sets 
benchmarks 
for 
monitoring 
and evaluating 
success. 
These benchmarks 
would 
then 
be 
aggregated 
and 
evaluated 
at 
the 
project 
level, 
as 
well. 
The 
M&E 
officer 
in 
the 
PIU 
would 
contract 
a 
local 
institution 
to 
design 
the 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
program, 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
Support 
Units 
and 
WUAs 
to 
use 
it, 
and 
evaluate progress 
periodically 
through 
information 
updates 
and 
field 
assessments. 
NGOs 
and 
other 
civil 
society 
institutions 
have been 
consulted 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
The 
project 
would 
achieve 
the

development outcomes described above

Safeguard 
Policies: 
7.2 
Describe 
provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
Environmental 
Assessment:

the 
text 
under 
Section 
E.5. 
Safety 
ofDams: 
In 
1998, 
a 
dam 
safety 
assessment 
of 
Mingechevir 
and Shamkir 
dams 
was 
carried 
out, 
which 
concluded that 
the 
two 
dams are 
in 
good condition. 
A 
more 
detailed 
assessment 
was 
made 
by 
a 
team 
of 
Azeri 
specialists 
at Shamkir 
in 
1999 
and 
Mingechevir 
in 
2000, and 
the 
dams 
were 
again 
found 
to 
be 
in 
satisfactory condition. 
In 
MarchiApril 
2003 a 
follow-on 
dam 
safety 
assessment 
for 
Mingechevir 
and 
Araz 
Dams 
was 
carried out 
by 
a 
team 
of 
international dam 
specialists. 
The 
assessment 
did 
not 
reveal 
any 
major 
structural and managerial dam 
safety issues 
that 
would 
have 
to 
be 
addressed 
under 
the 
project. 
Projects 
in International 
Waters: 
Many 
of 
the 
project 
farms 
would 
be 
located 
within 
basins 
of 
international 
waterways, 
therefore 
OP 
7.50 
applies. 
Azerbaijan 
is 
the 
most 
downstream 
country 
for 
all 
international 
rivers. 
The 
proposed 
rehabilitation works 
under 
IDSMIP 
would 
not 
have 
a 
significant 
adverse change 
to 
the 
quality 
or 
quantity 
of 
water flows, 
while 
the 
works 
would 
not 
change 
the nature 
of 
the 
original 
systems 
or 
alter 
or 
expand 
their 
scope 
and extent 
as 
to 
create 
a 
new or 
different 
scheme. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
have 
no 
impact 
on 
the 
quality 
or 
quantity 
of 
the 
river 
flow 
in 
the 
upper 
riparian 
countries. 
There 
would 
also 
be 
no 
impact 
on 
the 
Caspian 
Sea, 
since there 
would 
not 
be a 
significant 
adverse change 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
water 
flowing 
to 
the 
Sea. 
Similarly, 
water 
use 
in 
the 
riparian 
countries 
around 
the Caspian 
Sea 
would 
not 
affect 
the 
project.  The impact 
is 
thus 
expected 
to 
be 
negligible 
and 
subject 
to 
a 
waiver 
pursuant 
to 
paragraph 7 
(a) 
of 
OP 
7.50. 
A 
memorandum 
with 
this 
request was 
prepared 
for 
ECA 
VP's 
concurrence, 
which 
was 
provided 
on 
March 
11,2003. 
The 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement 
would 
have 
as 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
WUA 
participation 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
irrigation 
of 
new 
areas 
or 
expansion 
of 
existing 
irrigation 
infrastructure that 
would 
allow 
water abstraction above 
current 
design 
limits.

Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
present 
ISF 
does 
not 
ensure 
proper 
O&M 
of 
both 
the 
on-farm 
and 
off-farm 
irrigation 
systems. 
Fees 
only 
cover about 20 
percent 
of 
current 
expenditures 
on 
off-farm 
system 
maintenance, 
excluding 
operation 
of 
maintenance 
of 
pumps 
and 
wells. 
Including 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
pumped 
irrigation, 
the 
current 
ISF 
covers 
less 
than 
5 
percent 
of 
SAIC's 
total 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
budget. 
In 
the 
future, 
due 
to 
higher 
electricity 
tariffs 
and 
pump 
maintenance expenditures, 
the 
cost 
of 
pumped 
irrigation 
is 
expected 
to 
rise 
even 
higher. 
SAIC 
is 
aware 
that 
adequate 
and 
regular 
maintenance, 
as 
well 
as 
effective 
operation 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
are 
critical 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
project 
benefits. 
The 
current 
fee 
setting 
at 
very 
low 
rates 
is 
part 
of 
government's 
policy 
to 
keep 
costs 
of 
agriculture and 
irrigation to 
farmers 
to 
a 
minimum 
until 
such 
time 
that 
they 
can 
afford 
to 
gradually 
start 
paying 
higher 
fees. 
Sustainability 
of 
the 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
is 
a central 
issue 
to 
the 
long-term 
success 
of 
The 
first 
priority 
for 
the 
WUA 
would 
be 
the 
adequate 
funding 
of 
on-farm 
O&M. 
At 
present, 
WUAs 
are 
legally 
constrained 
to 
charging 
a 
premium 
of 
only 
25 percent above 
SAIC's ISF. 
Partly 
as 
a 
result, 
the 
net 
amounts 
typically 
collected 
by 
WUAs 
are 
around 
US 
$0.50 
per 
ha, 
which 
is 
barely 
enough 
to 
cover 
WUA 
salaries, 
much 
less 
administrative 
expenses 
or 
any 
system maintenance. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
to 
sustain themselves and 
carry out 
the necessary 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
their 
on-farm 
systems, 
WUAs 
would 
have 
to 
charge 
around 
$15 
per 
ha on 
average, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
ISF 
levied 
by 
SAIC. 
The 
project 
would 
increase the 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
WUAs 
by 
promoting 
changes 
in 
legislation 
to allow 
them 
to 
set 
fees 
that cover 
their 
needs. 
It 
would 
also encourage 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
dual 
tariff 
structure 
whereby 
WUAs 
would 
charge 
a 
portion 
of 
their 
fees 
as 
a 
fixed 
rate 
per 
ha 
in 
order 
to 
cover 
their 
standard 
fixed 
costs such 
as 
personnel, 
and a variable 
portion 
- 
based 
on 
actual water 
use 
- 
to 
cover other operating 
costs. 
The 
training 
and support 
program 
would 
have 
a 
major 
emphasis 
on 
financial 
sustainability, and 
the 
project 
would work 
closely 
with 
WUAs 
to 
explain 
the 
need 
for 
adequate 
contributions 
of 
the 
WUA 
members. 
Under 
the 
proposed 
project, 
SAIC would 
become 
a 
bulk 
seller 
of 
water 
with 
WUAs 
as 
the 
primary 
client. 
SAIC 
needs 
sufficient 
funds 
to 
provide 
this 
service and have 
satisfied 
customers. 
The 
funds 
would 
become 
available 
through 
a gradual 
increase 
in 
the 
ISF, 
payable 
by 
water 
users 
through 
the 
WAS. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
fee 
increases 
that 
WUAs 
would 
have 
to 
introduce 
for 
their 
own 
O&M, 
it 
is 
accepted that 
SAIC's 
increase 
in 
off-farm 
O&M 
coverage 
should be more 
gradual, 
starting 
at 
around 
AZM 
2 
per 
m3 
and increasing 
to 
around 
AZM 
10 per 
m3 
(or 
US 
$2 
per 
1,000 
m3) 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
Even 
with 
these 
increases 
in 
the 
fees 
charged 
by 
both 
the 
WUAs 
and SAIC, analysis 
of 
farm 
budgets 
suggests 
that 
in 
no 
case 
would 
they 
be 
greater 
than 
60 
percent 
of 
the 
increased earnings 
that 
farm 
families 
would 
receive 
as 
a result 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
the 
Government 
should 
provide 
the 
necessary 
financing 
needs 
to 
SAIC 
to 
carry out 
O&M 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
of 
main 
and 
secondary canals 
in 
the 
project 
area 
to 
prevent 
further 
deterioration. 
This 
should be 
a 
budget 
allocation 
over 
and above 
the 
current 
SAIC 
budget, 
to avoid 
that 
extra 
funds 
are 
channeled 
to 
the 
raions 
of 
the 
project 
area, 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
budget 
for 
other 
raions. 
A 
covenant 
under 
the 
project 
would 
contain 
provisions 
to 
ensure 
this. 
In 
practice, 
O&M 
costs 
would 
be 
farm 
specific, 
and 
would 
be 
calculated 
during 
the 
time 
of 
determining 
the 
rehabilitation 
needs. 
An 
analysis 
of 
economic 
viability 
would 
be 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
selecting 
WUAs 
for 
participation 
in 
the 
project 
in 
order 
to avoid 
investments 
with 
high 
associated maintenance 
costs 
(such 
as 
high-lift 
pumping) 
that 
farmers 
would 
be 
unable 
to 
sustain. 
Phasing 
in 
of 
full 
ISF 
would 
take 
place over a 
few 
years 
after 
rehabilitation 
has started. 
It 
would 
take 
-43- 
Page  48
into 
account 
the 
lower 
needs 
for 
maintenance 
during 
the 
first 
few 
years 
after 
rehabilitation 
and 
also 
the 
fact 
that 
full 
incremental 
incomes 
would 
be 
achieved a 
few 
years 
after 
rehabilitation 
works 
have been 
completed. 
N 
H 
It 
was 
found 
to be 
unreasonable that 
full 
financial responsibility 
for 
the 
large back-log 
of 
rehabilitation 
would 
be 
transferred 
to 
users, 
most 
of 
whom 
only 
recently 
became independent farmers. 
There 
would 
also 
not 
be 
much point 
in 
rehabilitating 
schemes 
if 
their 
O&M 
cannot 
be 
secured. 
Therefore, 
financing 
of 
ISF 
by 
WUA 
members, 
both 
for 
the 
WUA's 
own 
operations 
and SAIC's 
operations, 
should 
have preference 
over 
contributions 
to 
rehabilitations 
investments, 
which 
have 
been 
kept 
to 
a 
minimum 
under 
the 
project. 
Participation 
of 
a 
WUA 
in 
the 
proposed 
rehabilitation 
activities 
would 
also 
be 
subject 
to 
its 
commitment 
to 
carry out 
adequate 
maintenance 
works 
afterwards, 
and 
to 
its 
meeting 
the 
financial 
obligations 
for 
this. 
The 
WUA 
members 
as 
beneficiaries 
would 
thus 
be 
included 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
interventions and 
would 
be 
empowered 
to 
make 
decisions 
on 
the 
funding 
of 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
tasks, 
through 
the 
setting 
of 
irrigation 
service 
fees, 
collection 
of 
these 
fees, 
and 
utilization 
of 
funds. 
Government 
has agreed 
to 
amend 
the 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
to 
include proper 
legislation 
for 
WUA 
development. 
This 
has 
been 
supported 
by 
high-level 
government 
officials.  The 
DCA 
will 
have a 
reference 
that 
enabling 
legislation 
has 
to 
remain 
in 
place, 
satisfactory 
to 
the Association. 
Government's 
record 
in 
providing 
adequate 
O&M 
budget 
is 
weak. 
The project 
team 
would 
have 
continuing 
dialogue 
and, 
with 
supportive 
evidence, 
stress 
that 
inadequate 
funding 
would 
increase 
the 
medium- 
to long-term 
needs 
for 
the 
sub-sector, 
far 
in 
excess 
of 
what 
would 
be 
needed 
to 
maintain 
the 
infrastructure. 
A 
covenant 
requiring 
government 
to 
contribute 
adequately 
to 
the 
O&M 
of 
higher-order 
infrastructure 
in 
the 
project 
raions 
is 
included 
in 
the 
DCA. 
The project 
would 
also develop 
The project 
would 
develop 
promotion 
and 
awareness 
campaigns, 
which would 
include 
the 
importance 
of 
paying 
the 
full 
ISF 
for 
the services 
provided 
by 
SAIC 
and 
the 
WUA. 
The project 
would 
also 
put 
a 
major 
emphasis 
on 
increasing 
the 
sustainability 
of 
WUAs 
by 
provision 
of 
relevant 
training 
and 
advice, 
prior 
to 
investments 
in 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
canals. 
Discussions 
held 
during 
project 
preparation 
with 
the management 
and 
members 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the 
field 
revealed understanding 
by 
farmers 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
training 
in 
proper 
operation 
of 
WUAs. 
The 
most 
often mentioned 
subjects 
for 
training 
were: 
(i) 
how 
to 
use 
water 
for irrigation 
properly; 
(ii) 
how 
to 
distribute 
water 
properly; 
(iii) 
irrigation 
norms, 
and 
how to 
account 
for 
water; 
and 
(iv) 
conflict 
resolution 
in 
WAS. 
Farmers also 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
training 
in 
such subjects 
as 
marketing, 
business 
planning 
and agricultural 
technologies, where 
complementarity 
in 
training provision 
would 
be 
sought 
with 
ADCP.

Although 
technically 
competent, 
few

in 
Azerbaijan 
have 
knowledge 
of 
proper 
WUA 
development 
approaches

During

there 
would 
be 
major 
emphasis

creation.

of 
the

activities; 
A

The

of

Detailed 
Project 
Description 
AZERBAIJAN: 
IRRIGATION 
DISTRIBUTION 
SYSTEM 
& 
MANAGEMENT 
IMPROVEMENT 
PROJECT 
Introduction 
Azerbaijan 
has 
nine 
agro-climatic 
zones 
which 
offer potential 
for 
highly 
diversified 
agriculture. 
Except 
for 
areas 
near 
the 
foothills 
and 
the 
south-eastern 
part 
of 
the 
country, 
agriculture 
is 
largely 
dependent 
on 
irrigation 
due 
to 
low 
rainfall. 
Most 
agricultural 
land 
is 
under 
arid 
or 
semi-arid 
conditions 
with 
average 
annual 
rainfall 
of 
200-300 
mm. 
Evapotranspiration 
is 
high 
and 
generally 
exceeds 
effective 
rainfall 
by 
a 
factor 
of 
five 
or 
more. 
Consequently, 
irrigation 
is 
essential 
for 
reliable 
crop 
production. 
Thus 
constraints 
affecting 
the 
irrigation 
sub-sector have 
a large 
impact 
on 
the 
agricultural 
sector. 
The 
total 
area 
equipped 
for 
irrigation 
is 
1.45 
million 
ha, 
representing 
90 
percent 
of 
all 
arable 
land 
in 
the 
country. 
There 
is 
a 
high 
reliance 
on 
pumped 
irrigation to 
abstract 
water 
from main 
canals, 
with 
about 
440,000 
ha 
receiving 
water 
through 
at 
least one 
level 
of 
pumping. 
Irrigation 
water 
is 
predominantly 
distributed 
through 
open 
canal 
systems 
and surface-applied 
to 
the 
land.  Wheat 
and 
fodder 
crops 
are 
irrigated 
mainly 
by 
border 
strips. 
Cotton, 
maize and 
vegetables 
are 
grown 
as 
row 
crops and 
irrigated 
by 
furrows. 
Drainage 
is 
essential 
in 
many 
areas, 
but 
is 
most 
critical 
in 
the 
flat

Status 
of Irrigation and 
Drainage Infrastructure 
Maintenance 
of 
the 
irrigation 
systems 
was 
largely 
abandoned 
for 
most 
of 
the 
1990s, 
due 
to 
falling 
budgets 
from 
SAIC, impoverishment 
of 
the population, 
and 
disorganization 
in 
management, 
especially at 
former 
farm 
level. 
With 
this 
collapse 
in 
maintenance, 
systems 
have 
deteriorated 
substantially. 
The 
farm 
gate 
of 
the 
former 
farms defines 
the 
demarcation 
point 
between 
off-farm 
infrastructure, 
the 
responsibility 
of 
SAIC, 
and 
on-farm 
infrastructure. 
Formerly 
there was one 
or 
more 
hydroposts 
to 
control 
and 
measure 
the 
flow 
of 
irrigation 
water 
into 
the 
former 
farm, 
but 
most 
are 
no 
longer 
functioning. 
Water 
is 
generally distributed 
to 
farmers 
through 
a 
gravity network 
of 
tertiary and 
field 
channels 
(pre-cast 
concrete 
canalettes, 
or 
more commonly 
earthen). 
There 
are 
few 
permanent 
flow 
control 
structures on-farm, 
and where 
they 
exist, 
are 
either 
not 
operating 
or 
in 
poor 
condition. 
The 
following 
table 
provides 
an 
indication 
on 
the 
condition 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
systems. 
It 
shows 
that large 
sections 
of 
canals 
are 
in 
need 
of 
rehabilitation 
or 
reconstruction. 
The 
main 
features 
of 
the 
current 
status 
of 
the 
systems 
are: 
-51 
- 
Page  56
most 
canals 
are 
unlined, 
and many, 
especially 
at 
farm-level,  have become 
seriously 
blocked 
with 
silt, 
impeding 
or 
preventing 
water 
flow. 
On-farm 
canals 
are 
in 
especially 
poor 
condition, 
with 
most 
requiring 
desilting 
and 
installation 
of 
control 
structures; 
diversion 
headworks 
are 
often 
corroded 
and 
in 
need 
of 
reinforcement 
or 
replacement, even 
for 
major 
structures, 
such 
as 
the 
Bahramtape 
intake 
structure 
on 
the 
Araz 
River; 
many 
energy 
dissipation 
structures 
and 
outfall 
areashasins 
are 
damaged; 
many 
steel 
gates 
and 
valves 
are 
inoperable; 
flow 
measuring 
structures 
are 
almost 
non-existent, 
even 
on main 
canals 
and 
headworks; 
keeping electrically-driven 
pumps 
functioning 
is 
problematic, 
as 
most 
are obsolete, 
having 
been 
operating 
for 
25 
years 
without 
replacement; 
many electrically-driven 
tubewells 
for 
irrigation 
are 
no 
longer 
functioning; 
and 
drainage 
systems 
were seldom 
well 
maintained, 
even 
during 
the 
Soviet period, 
and after 
ten 
years 
of 
neglect 
most collectors 
are 
choked 
with 
weeds 
and 
silt. 
At 
least 
60-70 
percent 
of 
the 
area 
served 
by 
drains 
requires 
rehabilitation.

State 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
Committee 
Established 
in 
1993, 
SAIC 
replaced the 
former 
Ministry 
of 
Irrigation 
and 
assumed 
responsibility 
for 
managing 
the 
countrys 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems. 
This 
includes establishing 
national 
policy 
and 
legislation, 
planning 
ameliorative and 
irrigation 
measures, 
establishing 
technical 
standards 
and 
regulation, 
data 
collection 
and 
monitoring 
of 
irrigated 
lands. 
With 
cropped 
agriculture 
almost 
entirely 
dependent 
on 
irrigation, 
SAIC 
is 
of 
critical 
importance 
to 
the 
agriculture 
sector. 
SAIC 
has 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
executing and 
enforcing 
the 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
(1996), 
the 
Water 
Code 
(1997), 
and 
other 
related legislation 
in 
the water 
sector. 
With 
its 
headquarters 
in 
Baku, 
SAIC 
has 
reportedly 
some 
22,000 
employees. 
About 
19,000 
staff 
are 
based 
in 
the 
districts, 
including 
some 
12,000 
laborers. 
The 
district staff 
has 
as 
main 
responsibility 
the 
O&M 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems, 
but 
is 
engaged 
in 
other 
activities 
such 
as 
flood 
management. 
The raion 
offices 
are 
responsible 
for 
delivering 
irrigation 
water 
to 
farmers, 
maintaining 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems, 
operating 
pumping 
stations, 
and 
collecting irrigation 
service 
fees 
from 
WAS 
or 
individual 
farmers. 
SAIC 
has seven 
main 
directorates, 
including 
one 
for 
finance, another 
for 
administration, and a 
separate 
SAIC 
directorate 
for 
Nakhchivan. 
The 
five 
technical 
directorates 
include 
eight 
departments 
which 
cover 
design, 
construction, operation 
and 
maintenance, 
water 
resources 
and 
fee 
collection 
for 
all 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
department 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
- 
52 
- 
Page  57
O&M 
of 
major 
structures 
has 
special sections 
for 
some 
of 
the 
main 
canals, 
such 
as 
the 
Upper 
Karabakh 
and 
Upper 
Shirvan 
canals, 
which 
can traverse 
up 
to 
15 
raions. 
This 
department also 
oversees 
the 
60 
SAIC 
raion-level 
offices 
(rayvodkhoz 
- 
RVK). 
RVKs 
are 
responsible 
for 
O&M 
and capital 
repairs 
of 
the 
off-farm 
irrigation 
network, 
while main 
drainage 
collectors 
fall 
under 
the 
regional amelioration 
directorates. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
serious 
deterioration 
of 
on-farm infrastructure, 
in 
2000, 
SAIC 
made 
an 
assessment 
of 
on-farm 
infrastructure, 
and 
transferred 
responsibility 
for 
this 
to 
RVKs 
and 
amelioration 
directorates. 
However, 
without 
a 
substantial increase 
in 
resources 
to 
match 
the 
additional 
burden, 
the 
current 
on-farm situation 
remains unchanged. 
Work 
on 
creating a 
large 
number 
of 
WUAs 
was started 
in 
2000 
and 
given 
the 
limited 
amount 
of 
staff 
and 
financial 
resources 
invested 
the 
results have been 
impressive 
as 
at 
present 
a 
total 
of 
552 
WAS 
have been 
legally 
established 
in 
44 
raions, 
with 
387,000 
members 
and a 
total 
command 
area 
of 
644,000 
ha. 
The 
members' general 
level 
of 
knowledge 
about 
WUAs 
is 
limited 
and, 
in 
most communities, the 
WUAs 
are seen 
to 
be 
led 
by 
people 
who 
are 
not 
accountable 
to 
WUA 
members. 
Even 
though 
WUAs 
have already 
shown 
themselves 
to 
be 
quite 
effective 
in 
collecting 
water 
fees, 
they 
have 
been 
less 
effective 
in 
informing 
general 
membership 
about 
the 
purpose 
or 
use 
of 
the 
fees, 
which would 
become 
increasingly 
important 
as 
fees are 
raised 
over 
time. 
A 
WUA 
is 
thus 
mainly 
seen 
as 
an 
organization 
to 
distribute 
water 
and collect 
the 
ISF 
for 
SAIC, rather than a 
genuine 
farmer-led 
organization 
with 
the 
mandate 
of 
managing 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
Proposed 
Project 
Scope 
and 
Location 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
have 
two 
primary 
activities: 
(i) 
assist 
Government 
in 
building 
capacity to 
provide training 
and 
support 
to 
WUAs, 
and 
provide 
this 
training 
and 
support 
to 
WUAs; 
and 
(ii) 
assist 
in 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
improvement 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
the 
project 
would 
have 
two 
major 
components, 
while 
a 
smaller 
third 
component 
would 
provide project 
management support. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
some 
support 
to 
all 
raions, 
but 
it 
would 
provide more 
comprehensive 
institutional 
support 
to 
the 
11 
raions 
where 
rehabilitation 
activities 
would 
take place. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
following 
11 
raions 
would 
be 
covered: 
Aghjabedi, 
Babek, Beylagan, Geranboy, 
Guba, 
Imishli, 
Khachmaz, Saatli, 
Sabirabad, Sharur, 
and 
Zardab.  These 
raions 
have large 
irrigation 
areas, 
and 
they 
can 
be 
linked 
to other 
donor-assisted 
interventions 
in 
the 
sector. 
Several 
of 
the 
raions 
are 
benefiting 
from 
the 
ongoing 
RIDP, 
while 
FPP and 
ADCP 
are 
active 
in 
some 
of 
the 
raions 
as 
well.  The 
following 
table 
shows 
the 
current 
numbers 
of 
registered 
WUAs 
in 
the 
selected raions, 
and 
their 
respective 
irrigable 
areas.

SAIC 
has 
recognized 
it 
is 
in 
their 
best 
interest 
to 
have 
WAS, 
both 
to 
improve 
on-farm 
irrigation 
management 
as 
well 
as 
to 
ensure 
collection 
of 
fees, 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
gradually 
become 
a larger 
percentage 
of 
SAICs 
budget 
for 
O&M. 
With 
very 
limited 
financial 
and 
staff 
support, 
SAICs 
Department 
of 
Water 
Management 
and Water 
Fee 
Collection 
has 
become 
directly 
involved 
in 
the 
formation 
and 
creation 
of 
WUAs. 
Since 
the 
basic concept 
of 
the 
WUAs, 
including 
the 
standard 
documents 
prepared 
under 
FPP, 
have been 
approved 
by 
the 
Agrarian 
Commission 
of 
the 
Cabinet 
of 
Ministers, 
SAIC 
has 
adopted 
these 
for 
the 
creation and 
registration 
of 
other 
WUAs 
in 
the 
country. 
As 
would 
be 
expected 
without 
any 
special 
training, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
WUAs 
are 
not 
very 
effective. 
SAIC staff 
members have 
placed 
most 
of 
their 
efforts 
in 
helping 
WUAs 
complete the 
necessary 
forms 
for 
registration 
as 
well 
as 
signing 
contracts 
with 
SAIC 
for 
water 
delivery. 
Raion

system 
as 
well 
as 
the 
management system 
are 
focused 
at 
that 
point. 
These 
former 
state 
and 
collective 
farm 
service 
areas 
were 
normally 
800 
to 
2,000 
ha 
in 
size, 
with 
an 
average 
of 
approximately 
1,250 
ha 
per 
farm. 
In 
other 
countries 
this 
has 
proven 
to 
be 
a 
manageable 
size 
for 
a 
WUA. 
It 
is 
large enough 
to 
have economies 
of 
scale 
with 
respect 
to fixed 
costs 
while 
small 
enough 
to 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
WUA 
management 
staff 
and 
governed 
by 
a 
Council 
representing 
the 
users 
in 
the 
area. 
WUAs 
smaller 
than 
this, 
normally 
based 
on 
the 
area 
of 
a 
single 
village, 
are 
often 
too 
small 
to 
be 
able 
to 
cover 
the 
fixed 
costs 
of 
maintaining an 
association 
and 
consequently have 
had problems 
with 
their 
financial 
situation. 
The 
Development 
of 
Water 
Users 
Associations Component 
would 
include 
several 
activities, 
designed 
to 
develop 
sustainable 
operating 
WUAs 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
would 
finance 
technical 
assistance, 
goods, 
training 
and 
study 
tours. 
The 
technical 
assistance 
would 
be 
used 
to 
develop 
training 
and support 
plans 
and 
provide 
initial 
training 
courses. 
Goods, such 
as 
office 
and 
training 
equipment, 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
strengthen 
the 
units 
involved 
in 
the 
training 
and support 
of 
WUAs. 
Participating 
WUAs 
would 
also 
be 
able 
to 
source goods, 
including 
office 
equipment, 
motor 
bikes, 
small 
maintenance 
machinery 
and 
field 
survey 
and 
monitoring 
equipment, 
to 
facilitate their 
operations. 
Training 
programs 
and 
study 
tours 
would 
be 
financed. 
Activity 
1: 
Development 
of 
Capacity 
to 
Train 
and 
Strengthen 
WAS 
Proper development 
of 
WUAs, 
with 
adequate 
member 
participation, 
would 
require 
a 
serious 
program 
of 
assistance, 
for which 
there 
is 
little 
experience 
in 
the country. 
The 
project 
would 
assist 
with 
the development 
of 
the 
newly 
established 
SUs, 
both 
within 
SAIC 
in 
Baku 
and Nakhchivan, and 
the 
SAIC 
Raion 
offices. 
The 
staff 
of 
these 
Units 
are 
civil 
servants 
and 
their 
salaries 
would 
be 
paid 
by 
Government. 
The project 
would 
distinguish 
between Raion-SUs 
in 
11 
raions where 
rehabilitation 
activities 
would 
take 
place, and other raions. 
The 
Central-SU 
in 
Baku, 
the 
Nakhchivan 
SU 
and 
the 
12 
(there 
would 
be 
two 
SUs 
in 
Sabirabad) 
in 
the 
raions where 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
infrastructure 
is 
to 
be 
implemented 
would 
be 
supported 
with 
office 
equipment, vehicles, 
and 
part 
of 
the 
incremental 
operational 
funds. 
Both 
the 
Baku 
and 
Nakhchivan 
offices 
would 
be 
renovated, 
especially 
to 
establish 
training 
rooms 
with 
the necessary 
training 
equipment. 
The staff 
of 
the 
SUs 
would 
receive the 
training 
necessary 
to 
implement 
their 
WUA 
support 
and strengthening 
tasks. 
For 
this, 
national 
and 
international 
consultants 
would 
be recruited 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
within 
the SUs 
to 
establish, train, support 
and 
strengthen 
WUAs. 
The 
48 
SUs 
outside 
the 
immediate 
project 
area 
would 
receive 
some 
training 
support and a 
small allocation 
for 
office 
furniture 
and 
equipment. 
The 
Central-SU 
would 
have 
a 
staff 
of 
up 
to 
7 
members. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
country-wide 
training 
that 
would 
be 
provided, 
however, 
more 
staff may 
have 
to 
be 
added 
as 
the 
project 
progresses 
and 
the demands 
on 
the 
staff 
increase. Permanent 
slulls 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
the 
Central-SU 
would 
include: 
WUA 
Strengthening and Development, 
Training 
and Promotion, 
FinancialDSF 
Management, 
and 
Database 
Management. 
It 
could 
draw 
on 
local 
legal 
specialists 
for 
assistance 
with 
legal 
issues 
related 
to 
WUA 
development. 
The 
main 
tasks 
of 
the 
Central-SU 
would 
be 
to 
organize 
and 
implement 
the 
national 
WUA 
promotion 
program 
as 
well 
as 
to 
coordinate 
the 
WUA 
restructuring program 
and 
all 
training 
programs, 
both for 
the 
project 
WUAs 
and 
the 
larger 
set 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the 
country.  The project 
would 
provide 
support 
for 
the 
development 
and execution 
of 
the 
promotion 
and 
training 
programs.  Consultants 
would 
be 
hired 
to 
prepare 
promotion 
and 
training 
material, and 
funds 
would 
be 
available 
for 
the 
training 
of 
SU 
- 
55 
- 
Page  60
staff 
and 
WUAs. 
The Central-SU 
would 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
maintaining 
the 
database 
of 
all 
WUAs 
in 
the 
country, 
for 
which 
questionnaires 
and 
report 
formats 
have 
to 
be 
developed. 
As 
information 
would 
be 
fed 
into 
Baku 
from 
Raion-SUs 
this 
would 
be an 
excellent 
source 
to 
track 
changes 
in 
WUAs 
over 
time. 
It 
would 
also 
allow 
the 
project 
to 
monitor 
impacts 
as 
WUAs 
in 
the 
project 
Raion-SUs 
are 
expected 
to 
demonstrate 
the value 
of 
more intensive 
WUA 
support, 
while 
WAS 
in 
the 
non-project 
Raions 
would 
have 
less 
intensive 
support and 
therefore 
are 
expected 
to 
progress 
at 
a slower 
rate. 
SAIC 
intends 
to 
monitor 
the 
technical 
and financial 
performance 
of 
WUAs. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
on-farm infrastructure 
belongs 
to 
the 
State, 
SAIC 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
WUAs 
would 
need 
to 
develop a 
program 
for 
monitoring 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
infrastructure. 
This 
would 
operate 
in 
tandem 
with 
the 
system 
of 
monitoring 
the 
level 
of 
funds 
collected 
by 
the 
WUA 
for 
O&M 
of 
the 
system 
under 
WUA 
management. 
The 
oversight 
functions 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
Central-SU, 
which would 
carry out 
regular 
monitoring 
to 
ensure 
that 
WUAs 
conform 
to 
the 
set 
standards 
and that committees 
are 
elected 
fairly 
and 
operate 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
their 
constitutions. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
Central-SU 
to 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
these 
oversight functions 
by 
June 
30,2004. 
The 
SU 
in 
Nakhchivan 
would 
coordinate the 
WUA 
restructuring 
and 
training 
programs 
in 
Nakhchivan, 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Baku 
Central-SU. 
It 
would 
have 
three 
staff 
members, 
with 
slulls 
in 
WUA 
Development, 
Training 
and 
Promotion, and 
FinancialASF 
Management. 
Raion-SU 
staff 
would 
be trained 
under 
the 
project 
to 
equip 
them 
with 
knowledge 
and 
slulls 
to 
provide 
technical and 
institutional 
support 
to 
WUAs, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
become 
viable 
farmer-govemed 
organizations 
that 
are 
able 
to 
operate 
and 
maintain 
the 
infrastructure 
under 
their 
management 
in 
a 
sustainable 
way. 
The 
training 
of 
Raion-SU 
staff 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
Central-SU 
staff, consultants, and 
possibly 
NGOs. 
The 
composition 
of 
a 
Raion-SU 
would 
as 
a 
minimum 
be 
an 
Engineer, 
WUA 
Specialist, 
and 
Water 
Management Specialist. 
To 
develop 
strong 
viable 
WUAs, 
the 
project, 
working 
through 
the 
Raion-SUs 
would 
develop a 
close 
relationship 
with 
the 
WUAs. 
It 
is 
envisioned that 
WUAs 
would 
eventually become 
the 
main 
clients 
of 
SAIC 
as 
well 
as 
providing 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
budget 
to 
cover the 
O&M 
expenses 
of 
SAIC. 
Therefore, 
like 
any 
good 
business, 
it 
is 
in 
the best 
interest 
of 
SAIC 
to 
develop a close 
working 
relationship 
with 
the 
respective 
WUAs 
within 
its 
service 
area. 
As 
there 
would 
only 
be 
about 
15-30 
WUAs 
per 
Raion 
it 
is 
not 
that 
difficult 
task 
to 
get 
to know 
each 
and 
every 
WUA 
in 
the 
Raion. 
This 
is 
a necessity 
if 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Unit 
wants 
WUAs 
to 
expand 
and 
mature. 
The Raion-SU offices 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
planning 
and coordinating 
WUA 
development 
and 
strengthening 
activities, 
including 
training 
programs, 
and 
ensure 
that 
all 
the 
WUAs 
(both 
those 
involved 
in 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure 
as 
well 
as 
those 
not 
selected) 
in 
a 
raion 
would 
receive 
assistance. 
The 
WUA 
Support 
Unit 
in 
each 
raion 
would 
establish a 
monitoring 
process 
and establish 
an 
inventory 
for 
each 
WUA. 
It 
would 
be 
the 
SU's 
responsibility 
to 
continue 
to 
track 
and 
monitor 
each 
WUA 
that 
has 
been 
formed 
in 
their 
area. 
This 
would 
not 
just 
be 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
purposes, 
but 
also 
to 
guide 
assistance. 
With 
the 
formation 
of 
a large 
number 
of 
WUAs 
relatively 
quickly, 
it 
is 
inevitable 
that 
some 
of 
the 
WUAs 
would 
have problems 
with 
staff, 
financing 
or 
governance. 
It 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Unit 
and other 
SAIC staff 
to 
know 
these 
groups 
well 
and 
to 
be 
aware 
when 
a 
WUA 
is 
having difficulties. 
This 
may involve 
some 
additional 
training 
or 
workshops 
or 
it 
may be 
necessary 
for 
the 
WUA 
Specialist 
to 
assist 
with 
conflict 
resolution 
if 
there 
are 
disagreements among 
the 
users 
or 
factions 
of 
the 
users. 
Whatever 
needs 
to 
be 
done, 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
SU 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
WUAs 
stay 
healthy and 
operate 
smoothly. 
During 
the 
first 
two 
years 
when 
there 
is 
a 
big 
organizational 
push 
to 
help 
WUAs 
restructure 
and 
- 
56 
- 
Page  61
become 
more participatory 
as 
well 
as 
re-registered 
under 
the amended 
law, 
four 
Mobilization 
Specialists 
would 
be 
recruited 
by 
the 
PIU. 
They 
would 
be 
stationed 
in 
strategically 
selected Raion-SUs, 
but 
each 
of 
the 
specialists 
would 
cover several 
neighboring 
raions. 
These 
individuals 
would 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
International 
TA 
WUA 
Support consultants 
and 
the 
Support 
Unit 
in 
Baku. 
In 
particular 
they 
would 
be 
responsible 
to 
ensure 
staff 
members 
in 
the 
Raion-SU 
leam 
to 
work 
with 
WUAs 
as 
equals 
rather than 
seeing themselves 
as 
SAIC staff 
with 
control 
over 
the 
WUAs. 
They 
would 
also 
provide 
assistance 
to 
the 
Raion-SUs 
to help 
them recruit 
local, part-time 
WUA 
organizers 
in 
the 
villages where 
the 
WUAs 
are 
located. 
They 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
WUAs 
are 
reorganized 
such 
that 
they 
represent 
all 
the 
members 
instead 
of 
being 
controlled 
by 
a small 
handful 
of 
individuals 
as 
they 
are 
now. 
They 
would 
have 
to 
talk 
with 
the 
members 
of 
the 
WUA 
and 
the 
local 
leaders 
and make 
certain 
they 
understand 
the 
purpose 
of 
restructuring 
the 
WUA 
as 
well 
as 
the need 
to 
re-register 
to 
ensure 
the 
WUA 
is 
able 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
its 
non-profit 
status. 
The 
48 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
that 
are 
in 
the 
other 
raions where 
the 
project 
would 
not 
carry out 
rehabilitation 
would 
also 
need 
support 
for 
them 
to 
develop and 
strengthen 
WAS. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
some 
equipment 
for 
these 
units 
to 
help 
them 
function, and 
provide 
them 
with 
training 
material 
and 
basic 
training 
programs 
which 
would 
allow 
them 
to 
start 
a 
program 
of 
support 
to 
WUAs 
and 
would 
ensure 
that 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project, 
the concept 
of 
WUA 
Support 
Units, 
along 
with 
the 
staff, 
would 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
SAIC 
regular 
line 
structure. 
It 
would 
also 
be 
ensured 
that they 
can support 
the 
WUA 
database 
that 
would 
be 
maintained 
throughout the country. 
These 
raions 
would 
also 
provide 
an 
excellent 
set 
of 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
data 
for 
WUA 
formation 
and 
WUA 
change 
over 
time. 
Early 
during 
the 
project 
a 
Technical 
Assistance 
(TA) 
team 
would 
be 
recruited to 
provide 
technical 
expertise 
in 
WUA 
development 
that 
is 
currently 
not 
available 
in 
the 
country. 
.This 
team 
would 
include 
a 
mix 
of 
long- 
and short-term consultants, 
including 
a 
WUA 
Development Expert, 
Training 
and 
Promotion 
Specialist, 
Financial 
Specialist, 
Legal 
Specialist, 
and 
M&E 
Specialist. 
Some 
of 
the 
consultants 
would 
be 
in 
the 
country 
almost 
full 
time 
for 
the 
first 
year 
and 
then 
work 
3-4 months a 
year 
over the 
next 
1 
to 
2 
years 
while 
they 
work 
themselves 
out 
of 
a 
job. 
By 
the end 
of 
the 
fourth 
year 
it 
is 
expected that the 
local 
staff 
in 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
would 
have 
the expertise 
to 
manage 
all 
aspects 
of 
WUA 
establishment, 
training 
and 
development. 
The 
consultants 
would 
assist 
the 
Central-SU 
develop 
the 
WUA 
support 
program, 
prepare 
promotional and 
training 
material, and 
train 
trainers, 
especially 
in 
the 
Raion-SUs. 
The 
legal 
specialist 
would 
also 
review 
the implementation 
of 
the 
amended 
law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
and 
recommend 
further 
changes 
as 
needed. 
The 
consultants 
would 
be 
housed 
at 
SAIC 
and 
fully 
integrate 
their activities 
with 
the 
counterpart 
staff 
from 
the 
Support 
Unit. 
The 
Central-SU 
would 
also 
hire 
several 
short-term 
national 
consultants, 
especially 
with 
expertise 
in 
law 
and 
financial 
management, 
to 
participate 
in 
some 
of 
the 
training 
work. 
Activity 
2: 
WUA 
Strengthening 
The 
project 
would 
assist 
Azerbaijan 
with 
its 
first 
comprehensive attempt 
to 
institute 
a 
large, 
nation-wide 
promotion 
and 
training 
program 
for 
WAS. 
The 
program 
would 
have 
two 
components, one 
directed 
at 
sensitizing the 
users 
and 
the 
other 
directed 
at 
formal 
and 
informal 
training. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
on-demand support 
to 
farmers 
that 
are 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
WUAs. 
This 
would 
be 
done 
through 
promotional 
material 
and 
workshops. 
Information 
dissemination 
would 
be 
a 
priority 
of 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
project, 
following 
traditional information 
transmission 
mechanisms, 
as 
well 
as 
developing 
new 
ones 
that 
ensure 
that 
all 
stakeholders 
are 
reached 
and 
able 
to 
make 
informed 
decisions 
regarding 
restructuring 
and 
development 
of 
the 
WUA. 
The 
information 
campaigns 
would 
be 
accompanied 
by 
systematic 
training 
programs 
for 
existing 
WUA 
leadership, 
as 
well 
as 
aspiring, 
new 
leadership, 
including 
a 
range 
of 
people 
who 
would 
not 
necessarily 
assume 
leadership 
positions, 
but 
would 
be 
able 
- 
57 
- 
Page  62
independently 
to 
assess 
the 
performance 
of 
leaders 
to 
ensure transparency 
and 
accountability. 
When 
the legal framework 
is 
in 
place, one 
of 
the 
first 
tasks 
of 
Raion-SUs 
would 
be 
to help 
all 
existing 
WUAs 
to 
restructure, and 
gain legal 
re-registration according 
to 
the 
amended 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation, 
as 
public, non-profit 
associations 
rather than private, 
for-profit 
organizations 
as 
they 
are 
now. 
The 
current 
structure 
of 
WUAs 
has 
little 
chance 
of 
transforming 
into 
strong 
user 
organizations. 
The 
legislation 
proposed 
as 
part 
of 
project 
design 
proposes a 
new 
structure 
in 
which 
governance 
and 
management 
are separated. 
The 
governance 
part 
is 
a 
set 
of 
governing 
bodies 
filled 
by 
members 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis. 
These 
individuals 
are 
farmers 
and 
must 
be 
farming 
in 
the 
system 
to 
qualify 
for 
membership 
and the 
right 
to 
hold 
a 
position. 
The various 
governing 
bodies 
of 
the 
association 
are 
expected 
to 
include: 
e 
General 
Assembly (or 
Representative 
Assembly) 
as 
its 
leading 
body 
which 
determines the 
main 
policies. 
The 
assembly 
is 
the supreme 
body 
of 
any 
WUA, 
and 
is 
composed 
of 
all 
members 
of 
the 
Association, 
or 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an Association 
with 
a representative system 
comprised 
of 
all 
representatives; 
Administrative Council 
that 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
policies 
and 
decisions 
of 
the 
General 
Assembly. 
It 
is 
accountable 
to 
the 
General 
Assembly 
for 
the 
way 
in 
which 
it 
manages 
the 
activity 
of 
the Association, and 
would 
be 
comprised 
of 
five 
to nine 
members, 
one 
of 
whom 
will 
be 
the 
Chairperson; 
Audit 
Committee 
that 
supervises 
the 
careful 
management 
of 
the 
financial affairs 
of 
the 
Association, 
to 
inspect 
if 
the 
annual 
balance 
sheet 
and 
the 
surplus 
and 
deficit 
account 
are 
legally 
drawn 
up 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
registers; 
and 
Arbitration 
Committee 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
disputes 
within 
the 
WUA, 
including 
solving 
conflicts 
arising 
between 
the 
Association and 
its 
members. 
e 
e 
e 
In 
addition 
to 
the governance part, there 
is 
an implementation 
part 
of 
the 
association that 
is 
responsible 
for 
carrying 
out 
the decisions 
of 
the 
main 
governing 
bodies, 
the 
General Assembly and the 
Administrative Council. 
Day 
to 
day 
O&M 
activities 
of 
the 
WUA 
would 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
hired 
manager, accountant 
and technical staff. 
Although 
functions 
and 
authority 
are 
delegated 
to 
hired 
staff, 
the 
WUA 
Administrative Council 
would 
remain 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
proper 
management 
of 
operations 
and 
also 
for 
ensuring that objectives 
of 
the 
WUA 
are 
met. 
The 
manager, 
accountant 
and 
technical 
staff may 
not 
at 
the 
same 
time 
serve 
as 
a 
member 
of 
other bodies 
of 
the 
WUA. 
Successful 
restructuring 
of 
existing 
WUAs 
would 
require significant 
investment 
in 
public 
information, 
accompanied 
by 
a 
series 
of 
neighborhood-level 
discussions 
and 
public 
meetings 
in 
order 
to 
overcome the 
currently restricted 
patterns 
of 
information 
dissemination and establish 
a basis 
for 
replacing existing 
leadership 
with 
people 
who 
have 
grassroots support. 
The 
new 
structure 
must 
allow 
policy 
decisions 
to 
be 
made 
by 
the 
Administrative 
Council 
that 
represents 
all 
the members. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
restructuring, the 
WUA 
would 
also 
receive 
the 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
under 
long-term 
use. 
The 
development 
of 
WUAs 
is 
a 
continuing 
process 
that 
starts 
with 
promotion 
and 
education and 
continues 
after 
the 
associations 
are 
formed 
and 
registered. 
The 
project 
would 
have 
to 
develop 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
promotion 
and 
marketing material 
such 
as 
TV 
ads, 
posters, videos, brochures, booklets, etc. 
These 
would 
be 
developed 
at 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Unit 
in 
Baku. 
Once 
these 
materials 
are 
developed 
a 
national 
promotion 
plan 
needs 
to 
be organized 
to 
sell 
water 
users 
on 
WUAs, 
and persuade 
them 
that 
a 
WUA 
is 
necessary 
if 
they 
are 
going to 
have 
reliable 
irrigation 
O&M 
at 
the 
on-farm 
level, 
which 
of 
course 
requires 
them 
to 
pay 
the 
real 
costs 
of 
providing irrigation 
O&M 
services. 
Generally 
farmers 
are 
willing 
to 
pay more 
for 
irrigation 
O&M 
services, 
but 
they 
must 
be sold 
on 
the idea 
that 
O&M 
services 
provided 
by 
their 
own 
WUA 
may 
be 
more 
expensive, 
but 
they 
are 
better and 
more 
sustainable.

As 
soon 
as 
the farmers express 
a 
positive 
interest 
in 
establishing 
or 
restructuring 
a 
WUA, 
the 
SUs 
would 
help 
them 
through 
the 
registration 
process. Once registered, 
the 
real 
work 
begins. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
present 
process where 
SAIC 
has 
seemed 
to 
assume 
that 
registration 
is 
the 
end 
of 
the 
process, 
in 
fact, 
this 
is 
just 
the 
beginning. 
Now 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
must 
start 
training 
the 
Council 
Members, 
how 
to 
operate an honest 
and 
transparent 
participatory 
organization that belongs 
to 
the 
farmers 
and 
is 
there 
to 
serve 
the 
farmers 
irrigation 
requirements. 
They 
would 
also 
need 
to 
start 
training 
the 
water 
supply 
staff 
on 
techniques 
for 
proper 
maintenance 
and 
system 
operation. 
In 
addition 
the 
accountant 
and 
bookkeeper 
need 
to 
start 
learning 
how 
to 
keep an 
open 
set 
of 
books and 
develop procedures 
for 
establishing water 
charges 
and 
fee 
collection. 
During 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
a large 
number 
of 
training 
courses 
would 
be 
conducted. 
These 
courses 
would 
both 
strengthen 
the 
SUs 
and 
participating 
WUAs. 
One 
of 
the 
first 
tasks 
of 
the 
Central-SU and 
its 
consultants 
would 
be 
to 
carry 
out 
a detailed 
training 
needs 
assessment, 
building 
on 
the 
initial 
assessment 
that 
was done 
during 
project 
preparation. 
At 
this 
stage 
it 
is 
difficult to 
estimate 
exactly 
how 
many 
training 
courses 
are 
required 
but 
a 
first 
estimate 
is 
that 
approximately 
140 
courses 
would 
be 
developed 
and 
conducted 
(the 
table 
on 
the 
following 
page 
provides 
an 
indication 
about the number and 
timing 
of 
courses). 
Training 
modules 
would 
be 
prepared 
jointly 
by 
the international 
experts and 
local 
trainers. 
Expected 
subjects 
include: 
e

including 
the 
important 
role 
of 
the 
WUA 
Council; 
WUA 
administration and 
the roles 
of 
the various 
staff 
members (personnel management); 
Irrigation

and 
methods 
of

Improvement 
of 
Agricultural 
Technologies. 
In 
areas 
such 
as 
agronomy, 
crop 
production 
and 
crop-water management 
other projects, 
including 
ADCP 
and 
FPP, 
have 
developed 
training 
modules, 
and 
these 
modules 
would 
be 
adapted 
and 
used 
for 
this 
project 
as 
well. 
Training Providers. 
Staff 
from 
the 
Central-SU, 
its 
consultants 
and 
short-term 
local 
consultants 
would 
provide 
training 
to 
Raion-SU 
staff 
(train-the-trainers). 
During 
the 
initial 
courses 
to 
WUAs 
the 
trainers 
from 
the 
central 
office 
would 
participate 
with 
the 
Raion-SU 
staff 
to 
ensure 
that 
course 
content 
of 
the 
training 
courses 
meets 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
project 
and the 
users. 
Raion-SU staff 
would 
provide 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
WUA 
training, 
however, 
some 
training 
would 
be 
best done 
by 
private 
companies 
under 
contract, 
especially 
such 
courses 
as 
training 
WUA 
Accountants and 
Administrative Council 
members. 
Other 
possible 
outsourced 
training 
includes 
courses 
in 
conflict 
resolution, procurement 
and 
contracting, and 
auditing 
techniques 
for 
members 
of 
the 
Audit 
Committee. 
Project 
funds 
have 
been 
reserved 
for 
this 
purpose. 
The 
use 
of 
ADCP 
master 
training 
advisors 
to provide 
some 
training 
to 
Raion-SU 
staff 
would 
be 
determined when 
the 
detailed 
training 
program 
is 
being 
prepared. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Justice 
has 
established 
a 
training 
center 
in 
Baku, 
which would 
be 
available 
to 
provide training 
in 
legal 
subjects.

Estimated Number 
of 
Training 
Courses 
Study 
Tours 
to 
Learn 
Hands-on Experience 
on 
WUA 
Operation. 
Besides 
the 
in-country 
training 
program, 
it 
would 
be 
important 
to 
expose the 
main 
project staff 
and 
some 
WUA 
representatives 
to 
experiences 
in 
WUA 
development and transfer 
of 
irrigation 
management 
in 
other 
countries, 
especially 
those 
with 
economic 
conditions 
similar to 
those 
found 
locally. 
This 
could 
best 
be 
done 
in 
a setting where 
a 
study 
group 
would 
spend several days 
in 
one 
WUA, 
to 
get 
acquainted 
with 
the 
day 
to 
day operation 
of 
a 
successful 
WUA. 
This 
would 
provide 
insights 
to the requirements 
for 
accepting 
full 
responsibility 
for 
O&M 
and 
financial 
management 
of 
large 
service 
areas. 
A 
study 
tours 
for 
senior 
project officials 
would 
be 
organized 
in 
Mexico 
and 
the 
US, where mature 
WUAs 
have developed. 
The project 
would 
work 
with 
a large number 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
raions mentioned 
above. 
About 
45 
WUAs, 
with 
an average 
command 
area 
of 
1,250 ha, 
would 
be 
selected 
for 
rehabilitation. 
For 
these, 
a 
-

- 
Page  65
limited 
amount 
of 
equipment 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
project. 
This 
is 
expected 
to include 
office 
furniture,  a computer, two-way 
radios, 
motorcycles, 
small 
canal maintenance 
machinery, 
etc. 
The 
benefiting 
WUAs 
would 
collect 
funds 
from 
their 
members 
for 
the replacement 
of 
the 
equipment. 
The 
usefulness 
of 
each 
request 
for 
equipment 
from 
WUAs 
would 
be 
carefully 
analyzed 
by 
the 
SUs 
and 
the 
Project Implementation 
Unit 
(PTU). 
The 
benefiting 
WUAs 
would 
collect 
funds 
from 
their 
members 
for 
the replacement 
of 
the equipment.  Raion-SUs 
would 
review 
each 
replacement 
fund 
proposal 
and 
monitor 
the 
collection 
of 
ISF 
for 
this 
purpose. 
Project 
Component 
2 
- 
US$30.00 
million 
Irrigation 
and 
Drainage Infrastructure Rehabilitation 
In 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
WUAs, 
they 
need 
to 
have 
infrastructure 
that 
allows 
efficient 
and 
reliable 
water 
distribution, 
so 
that farmers 
can 
receive water 
in 
the 
right 
amount, 
at 
the 
right 
time, 
and 
at the 
right 
place. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
funds 
for 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and drainage 
systems. 
The project 
would 
target 
some 
280 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
selected raions, 
of 
which 
about 
45 
of 
those that reach 
sufficient 
maturity 
would 
benefit 
from 
rehabilitation 
investments 
(hereafter 
referred 
to 
as 
rehabilitation 
WAS 
or 
R-WUAs). 
Rehabilitation 
would 
not 
only 
be 
at 
on-farm 
level, 
as 
it 
also has 
to 
be 
ensured 
that water 
supply 
to 
the 
WUA 
boundaries 
is 
reliable. 
Funds 
would 
be 
provided 
for: 
(i) 
rehabilitation 
of 
on-farm infrastructure 
on 
about 
56,000 
ha 
(US 
$19.0 
million); 
(ii) 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
Bahramtape headworks 
on 
the 
Araz 
River, 
which 
has 
stability 
issues, 
requiring 
urgent 
attention, 
and 
which 
serves 
some 
140,000 
ha, 
including 
large 
areas 
in 
three 
of 
the 
projects 
target 
raions 
(Sabirabad, 
Imishli 
and 
Saatli) 
(US 
$4.2 
million); 
and 
(iii) 
rehabilitation 
of 
off-farm 
works 
associated 
with 
the on-farm works 
to 
ensure 
sufficient 
and 
timely 
water 
delivery 
to 
project 
WAS 
(US 
$1.4 
million 
for 
hydroposts, and 
US 
$3.2 
million 
for 
other 
off-farm 
works). 
Off-farm 
rehabilitation 
investments, 
including 
the 
major 
headworks and 
hydroposts, 
would 
be restricted 
to 
around 
35 
percent 
of 
available 
rehabilitation 
funds 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
bulk 
of 
investments 
are at 
the 
farm 
level, where 
the 
most 
serious 
deterioration 
has 
taken place 
during 
the 
past 
years. 
To 
ensure 
the 
project works 
with 
sustainable 
WUAs, 
the 
project 
must 
establish selection 
criteria 
for 
determining 
which 
WUAs 
to 
include 
in 
irrigation 
rehabilitation 
work. 
It 
is 
important 
that 
WAS 
demonstrate 
they 
are 
interested 
in 
maintaining 
the 
on-farm 
irrigation 
infrastructure. 
This 
requires they 
are 
willing 
to 
pay 
a 
reasonable service 
fee. 
This 
fee 
must 
include 
enough 
funds 
to 
support the 
WUAs 
on-farm 
O&M 
activities 
as 
well 
as 
make the 
required 
payments 
to SAIC. 
To 
identify 
WUAs 
that 
are 
considered 
good 
candidates 
for irrigation 
systems 
improvement 
a 
step-by-step process 
toward 
sustainability 
has 
been 
established. 
The 
project 
would 
adopt a 
generic 
and 
competitive 
approach, 
whereby 
all 
target 
WUAs 
would 
receive 
institutional 
support, 
but 
only 
those 
which 
meet 
prescribed 
criteria 
would 
be 
eligible 
for 
subsidized 
rehabilitation 
of 
their 
systems. 
As 
funds 
are 
limited, 
the 
project 
would 
adopt 
a 
first 
come, 
first 
served 
procedure, 
which would 
accelerate 
WUA 
response. 
The 
eligibility 
criteria 
are:

The

follow 
the 
concept 
of 
farmer-driven 
development, 
a 
participatory 
process 
in 
which 
irrigators (through 
WAS) 
identify 
their 
needs 
and 
are 
involved 
in 
resource 
allocation, 
decision 
making, implementation, and 
monitoring.  The 
decisions 
concerning the 
priorities, 
works 
required and 
scale 
of 
investments 
would 
lie 
largely 
with 
farmers, 
and 
the 
project 
would 
be 
responsive 
to 
these 
requirements.  Procedures 
for 
identifying 
and 
implementing 
interventions 
would 
ensure 
a consultative 
and 
transparent process 
to 
determine 
priorities, 
costs, 
benefits 
and the users' 
responsibility 
for 
limited 
cost 
recovery. 
Increased 
farmer 
involvement 
from 
the 
outset 
would 
engender 
a 
sense 
of 
ownership, 
and 
a 
willingness 
to 
maintain 
and 
take 
care 
of 
the 
improvements. 
This 
process 
marks 
an 
important 
change 
from 
the 
former reliance 
on 
centralized 
financing 
and control. 
During 
the diagnostic 
surveys, farmers 
expressed 
a 
willingness 
to 
contribute 
financially 
towards 
rehabilitation 
costs, 
provided 
this 
is 
available 
under 
easy 
repayment terms, 
and 
after 
the 
works 
have 
been 
completed. 
It 
was agreed 
that the 
project 
plan 
for 
a 
small 
percentage repayment 
of 
ten 
percent, 
with 
low-fixed 
interest 
rate, 
based 
on 
inflation, 
but 
not 
to 
exceed 
10 
percent.  Repayment 
would 
be 
over a 
four 
year 
period, starting 
in 
the 
fifth 
year 
after 
the 
completion 
of 
rehabilitation 
works. 
The 
funds 
would 
be collected 
as 
ISF 
and 
used 
by 
SAIC 
for 
increased 
O&M. 
Based 
on 
various 
studies, 
it 
was 
determined that 
the 
average 
investment 
for 
on-farm 
rehabilitation 
can 
be 
estimated 
at 
US 
$300 
per 
ha. 
This 
would 
allow 
basic 
rehabilitation 
interventions 
to 
retum 
a 
system 
to 
operational 
conditions, 
which typically would 
include 
canal and 
drain 
cleaning, 
repair 
of 
canal 
lining, 
rehabilitation 
and 
construction 
of 
hydraulic 
structures 
(including 
cross regulators, 
division 
boxes, 
drop 
structures, 
gates, 
and 
flow 
measurement 
devices), 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
boreholes. 
The 
costs 
of 
rehabilitation works 
would 
vary 
widely 
across 
the 
project 
area, 
depending 
on 
the 
scale 
and 
nature 
of 
works required 
at 
each 
site. 
It 
was agreed 
with 
SAIC 
that 
the available 
funds 
would 
be 
used 
as 
efficiently 
as 
possible, 
so 
that the 
maximum 
number 
of 
WUAs 
can 
be 
served. 
Costs 
have been calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
unit 
prices 
from 
recently 
awarded 
civil 
works 
contracts 
for 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
works. 
Some 
of 
these 
unit 
costs are 
slightly 
higher 
than 
those 
used 
by 
SAIC 
for 
planning 
purposes, 
which 
may 
not 
be 
fully 
based 
on 
the current market conditions. 
For 
example, 
SAIC's 
unit 
rate 
for 
earthworks 
is 
US 
$0.30, 
while 
the analysis 
carried 
out 
during 
project preparation 
determined 
that the average 
market 
cost 
is 
Us 
$0.50 
per 
m3.

The 
Bahramtape 
headworks 
distributes 
water 
from 
the 
Araz 
river 
and 
Upper 
Karabakh 
canal 
to 
four 
main 
canals 
serving 
some 
140,000 
ha 
of 
irrigated land 
in 
five 
raions. 
The 
headworks 
were 
completed 
in 
1950, 
with 
only 
routine 
maintenance 
being 
carried 
out 
over 
the 
next 
forty 
years 
until 
the 
end 
of 
Soviet 
support 
in 
199 
1. 
There have been 
no 
repairs 
in 
the 
decade 
since, 
and the 
headworks 
are 
now 
in 
poor 
condition, 
with 
an increasing 
risk 
of 
collapse 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
major 
flood. 
SAIC 
recognizes 
the 
need 
for 
urgent 
capital 
repairs, 
but 
it 
has been 
unable 
to 
take action, 
due 
to 
budgetary 
constraints. 
The 
headworks 
has 
six 
main 
gates, 
and 
the 
flow 
through 
two 
gates at 
the 
right 
end 
has 
caused 
scouring 
in 
the 
immediate 
outfall 
area. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
poor 
hydraulic 
design, 
and 
there 
is 
clear 
evidence 
(cracks 
in 
the 
concrete) 
that the foundations 
of 
the 
supply 
channel 
to 
the 
sedimentation basin 
are 
being 
undermined. 
A 
high 
wall 
(1 
5 
m), 
bordering 
the 
river, 
forms part 
of 
this 
channel 
and 
appears 
close 
to 
- 
64 
- 
Page  69
collapse. 
It 
is 
also 
probable 
that 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
main 
diversion 
structure 
might 
have become 
weakened 
by 
voids, 
but 
this 
would 
require 
detailed investigation. 
The 
two 
end 
gates 
are 
kept 
either 
partially 
or 
fully 
closed 
to 
reduce 
flows 
and 
minimize 
the 
risk 
of 
further 
scouring. 
However, 
in 
the event 
of 
a large 
flood, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
open 
all 
gates, 
which 
could 
jeopardize the 
whole 
structure. 
All 
of 
the 
gates 
in 
the 
sedimentation 
basin 
on 
the 
right 
bank 
are 
in 
an advanced 
state 
of 
decay.  Some 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
reinforce 
the foundation, 
but 
without 
noticeable effect. 
The project 
would 
provide 
the 
funds 
necessary 
to 
guarantee 
the 
safety 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
structure 
for 
the 
next 
decades. 
In 
order 
for 
SAIC 
to 
deliver 
adequate 
and 
timely 
volumes 
of 
water 
to 
the 
R-WAS, 
the 
higher 
order 
irrigation 
system 
would 
have 
to 
be 
in 
fully 
operational condition. 
It 
would 
thus 
have 
to 
be 
ensured 
that 
main 
canal 
and 
drainage 
systems 
have 
sufficient 
capacity and 
ability 
to 
supply 
water 
to 
or 
drain 
water away 
from 
WUA 
areas. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
higher 
order 
systems, 
addressing 
specific 
bottlenecks 
such 
as 
limited 
repairs 
to 
abstraction 
structures 
(river 
diversions 
or 
pump 
stations), 
canal 
cleaning 
and 
reconstruction 
of 
hydraulic 
control 
structures. 
The 
off-farm 
works 
would 
also 
include 
the reinstatement 
of 
about 
1,000 
water 
measuring 
structures (hydroposts). 
This 
would 
be 
part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
the 
reintroduction 
of 
volumetric 
water 
measurement, 
a 
conditionality 
of 
the 
financing 
of 
rehabilitation 
works 
for 
the 
project 
WAS. 
The project 
would 
provide 
for 
necessary 
design 
and supervision 
services 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
works 
are 
properly 
designed 
and carried 
out 
with 
sufficient construction 
supervision 
and 
quality 
control. 
Design 
and supervision 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
works 
would 
be 
delegated 
to 
engineering 
consultants. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
there 
would 
be 
a 
separate 
contract 
with 
an international consulting 
firm 
to 
design 
the 
rehabilitation works 
for 
Bahramtape 
weir. 
Another contract 
would 
be 
awarded 
for 
the 
design 
and 
supervision 
of 
the 
on- 
and 
off-farm 
works. 
It 
is 
expected 
that a 
lot 
of 
this 
work 
can 
be carried 
out 
with 
maximum local 
consulting 
firm 
participation.  The 
PIU 
would 
also 
have 
the 
option to 
hire 
some 
short-term 
international 
inputs 
to 
assist 
for 
example 
in 
the development 
of 
modem hydraulic 
structures.

Project Management 
With 
the 
similarities 
in 
implementation 
requirements 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Completion 
of 
Irrigation 
and Drainage Infrastructure Project, 
the 
existing 
Project Implementation 
Unit 
would 
also 
be 
responsible, 
on 
behalf 
of 
SAIC, 
for 
the 
daily 
management, 
administration 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
IDSMIP. 
The 
PIU 
would 
have 
a 
cadre 
of 
staff, such 
as 
a director, 
M&E 
and 
environmental 
specialists, 
that 
would 
be 
shared 
by 
the 
two 
projects. 
The 
PIU 
would 
be 
strengthened 
with 
a 
project 
manager, 
a 
design 
engineer, 
three 
construction 
supervisors, an accountant 
and 
a procurement 
specialist. 
These 
individuals 
would 
play 
a 
coordinating 
role 
between the 
IDA 
and 
the 
project. 
The 
PIU 
would be 
responsible 
for 
carrying out 
all 
procurement actions under the 
project. 
This 
would 
include 
ensuring that procurement 
meets 
all 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures. 
Financial 
reports 
for 
the 
project 
would 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
PIU 
accountant 
using 
data 
provided 
by 
the 
offices 
in 
Baku 
and 
the Raions. 
The 
PIU 
accountant 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
including 
auditing 
and 
other 
internal 
controls. 
The 
engineer 
and 
supervisors 
would 
ensure 
that the technical 
aspects 
of 
the 
engineering 
work 
are 
carried out professionally. 
These supervisors 
would 
countersign, 
along 
with 
the 
Raion-SU 
engineer, 
the 
design and 
supervision 
consultant 
engineer, 
and 
WUA 
representative 
for 
on-farm 
works, 
to 
authorize 
payments 
for 
completed 
civil 
works. 
The 
PIU 
would 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
projects activities. 
It 
would 
establish a 
project-wide 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system, 
which would allow 
the 
PIU 
to 
track project 
-

success 
by 
measuring benefits 
in 
the 
project 
sites. 
It 
would 
also 
allow 
the 
PIU 
to pinpoint 
locations 
where the 
project 
is 
having 
difficulties. 
The 
M&E 
Specialist 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
this 
system 
is 
established and 
works 
properly. 
Funds 
for 
regular 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
selected 
project 
areas 
would 
be 
provided.  The environmental 
specialist 
would 
coordinate 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Management and 
Monitoring 
Plan, 
funded 
by 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
finance the annual audit 
of 
project 
accounts.

Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
Overview 
The 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
would 
result 
from 
investments 
in: 
(i) 
rehabilitation 
of 
on-farm 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
for 
some 
56,000 
ha 
of 
service 
area 
of 
WUAs 
in 
the 
11 
project 
raions; 
(ii) 
selective 
rehabilitation 
of 
related 
off-farm 
infrastructure 
in 
the 
1 1 
project 
raions; 
and 
(iii) 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
Bahramtape headworks. 
In 
addition, 
components 
to 
strengthen 
WUAs 
and 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
of 
SAIC 
to train 
and support 
WUAs 
would 
result 
in 
improved 
management 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
and 
increased 
timeliness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
water 
supply, 
and 
would 
enhance 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
investments. 
Project 
costs 
result 
from 
the 
costs 
of 
infrastructure 
design, 
supervision, 
and construction 
or 
rehabilitation; 
from 
the 
provision 
of 
equipment 
and 
office 
renovation 
for 
WUA 
SUs 
and 
equipment 
for 
WUAs 
themselves; 
and 
from 
the 
hiring 
of 
specialists 
and 
staff 
for 
training 
and 
overall 
project 
management. 
An 
economic analysis was 
carried 
out 
separately 
for 
the 
WUA 
rehabilitation 
sub-component, 
for 
the 
repair 
to 
the 
Bahramtape headworks, 
and 
for 
the 
project 
as 
a 
whole (including 
the costs 
of 
investments 
in 
training 
and 
development 
of 
WUAs, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
construction 
of 
hydroposts). 
The 
analysis 
is 
based 
on 
a 
calculation 
of 
incremental 
net 
benefits 
attributable 
to 
the 
project 
by 
comparison 
of 
the 
with 
project 
(WIP) 
scenario 
and 
the 
without 
project 
(WOP) 
scenario. 
Sensitivity 
analysis 
was 
also 
conducted 
to 
gauge 
the effects 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
main 
assumptions. 
Overall 
Economic 
Internal 
Rate 
of 
Return 
(EIRR) 
An 
economic analysis was 
carried 
out 
on 
project 
investments that 
resulted 
in 
an 
EIRR 
for 
the 
overall 
project 
of 
2 
1 
percent. 
Separate analyses 
which 
compared the 
benefits 
and 
costs 
of 
investments 
in 
rehabilitation 
of 
WUA 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
and Bahramtape 
resulted 
in 
EIRRs 
of 
25 
percent 
and 
39 
percent, 
respectively. 
The 
sections 
below 
provide 
summaries 
of 
each 
of 
the 
three 
analyses, 
including 
information 
on 
the 
models, calculations, assumptions 
and

WA 
Rehabilitation 
The 
project 
would 
rehabilitate 
some 56,000 
ha 
of 
service 
area 
of 
WUAs 
in 
11 
raions 
as 
well 
as 
required 
complementary 
off-farm 
works. 
This 
assumes 
that 
the 
costs 
of 
on-farm 
rehabilitation 
would 
average 
US 
$300/ha. 
The 
incremental 
benefits 
of 
these 
investments 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
WOP 
scenario 
would 
derive 
from 
three 
sources: 
(i) 
an increase 
in 
yields 
due 
to 
improved irrigation 
water 
distribution 
and 
delivery to 
farmers; 
(ii) 
an increase 
in 
the 
area 
irrigated; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
change 
in 
cropping 
patterns 
towards 
more lucrative 
cash crops. 
Under 
the 
base 
case 
scenario 
described 
below, 
the 
NPV 
of 
incremental 
benefits, net 
of 
incremental 
costs 
of 
water delivery, 
is 
US 
$23.2 
million. 
Without 
the 
Project: 
With 
the 
supply 
of 
irrigation 
water 
becoming 
less 
reliable 
and 
patchier, 
an 
increasing 
proportion 
of 
the 
command 
area 
(1.5 
percent 
per 
year 
resulting 
in 
a compounded 
17 
percent 
by 
Year 
12) 
would 
cease 
to 
be cultivated and 
the 
proportion 
of 
cash 
crops, 
which 
require regular irrigation, 
would 
decrease (5 
percent 
per 
year) 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
winter 
wheat and fodder. 
Yields 
and 
input 
use 
would 
rise 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
Agricultural 
Development and 
Credit Project and 
other 
ongoing 
agricultural 
development 
initiatives, 
but 
rather 
slowly 
(between 
0.5 
percent and 
1 
percent 
per 
year). 
With 
the 
Project: 
Investment 
in 
rehabilitation, 
together 
with 
support 
to 
WUA 
management, 
would 
result 
in 
increased 
efficiency 
of 
water 
distribution 
such that farmers 
would 
receive 
on 
average 
4 
irrigations 
annually 
instead 
of 
around 2 
irrigations 
on 
average 
currently. 
In 
the context 
of 
improved 
water 
management 
by 
the 
WAS, 
and 
the 
re-introduction 
of 
volumetric 
charges 
for 
water, increases 
in 
water 
abstractions 
by 
the 
WUAs 
benefiting 
from 
rehabilitation 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
about 10 percent 
over 
current levels. 
All 
parts 
of 
the 
system 
would 
be 
brought back 
into 
operation, 
and 
10 percent 
of 
the 
command 
area 
would 
be 
returned 
from fallow to 
agricultural 
production 
as 
a 
result. 
Crops 
would 
benefit 
from 
improved 
water 
supply, 
resulting 
in 
increases 
in 
yields 
and 
input 
application 
over 
the 
WOP. 
Yields 
would 
reach 
levels 
between 
15 
percent 
and 
46 
percent 
higher 
than 
WOP 
depending 
on 
the 
crop.  There 
would 
also 
be 
a 
change 
in 
the 
cropping pattern 
away 
from 
winter 
wheat 
and fodder towards 
more 
lucrative 
cash 
crops, 
such 
as 
fruits, 
vegetables 
and cotton. 
The 
assumptions 
on 
changes 
in 
cropping 
patterns 
are 
conservative. 
They include 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
share 
of 
wheat 
in 
the 
area 
cropped 
from 
69 
percent 
to 
65 
percent 
after 12 
years, 
a 
decrease 
of 
fodder 
from 
11 
percent 
to 
10 
percent, 
and 
increases 
in 
the 
shares 
of 
fruits, 
vegetables 
and 
cotton 
from 
3 
to 
4 
percent, 
4 
to 
5 percent and 
8 
to 
10 percent, 
respectively.  Incremental 
costs 
of 
WUA 
management 
and 
of 
O&M 
of 
the 
system 
under 
WUA 
management 
would 
amount 
to 
an average 
of 
US 
SlYha. 
Bahramtape 
Headworks 
Rehabilitation 
Approximately 
US 
$4.2 
million 
have been 
estimated 
for 
rehabilitation 
of 
Bahramtape headworks, 
including modification 
of 
design 
as 
necessary. 
The 
benefits 
from 
the 
works 
and 
a 
consequent 
rationalization 
of 
its 
operation 
would 
include: 
(i) 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
quantities 
of 
silt 
entering 
the 
irrigation 
network; and 
(ii) 
more importantly, 
the 
prevention 
of 
the 
collapse 
of 
the headworks and the 
consequent loss 
of 
all 
of 
the attendant 
irrigation 
system. 
Without 
the 
Project: 
The 
irrigation 
system 
would 
continue 
to 
silt 
up 
as 
at 
present, 
thereby 
reducing 
the 
flow 
of 
water 
to 
farmers, 
and 
causing 
high 
maintenance 
costs. 
More 
significantly, 
if 
the 
headworks 
failed 
(as 
they 
are 
expected 
to 
do 
in 
serious 
flood 
conditions) 
some 
140,000 
ha 
of 
command 
might 
fall 
out 
of 
operation. 
Allowing for 
the 
fact that 
up 
to 30 
percent 
of 
the 
current command 
area 
may 
not 
actually be irrigated 
at 
present, 
the 
net 
benefit 
to 
farmers 
from 
cropping 
this 
area 
is 
estimated 
at 
about 
US 
$20 
million 
annually. 
This 
estimate 
is 
based 
on 
the current 
average 
cropping 
pattern, 
agricultural 
practices, and 
fee 
structure, 
and 
is 
equivalent 
to 
an 
average 
of 
US 
$145/ha 
for 
the 
full 
command 
area. 
Deducting 
an 
economic cost 
of 
pumping 
of 
US 
$8O/ha 
on 
35 percent 
of 
the 
area 
and 
US 
$10/ha 
for 
- 
69 
- 
Page  74
current 
O&M 
costs, 
still 
results 
in 
an 
annual 
net 
economic 
benefit 
of 
about 
US 
S 
15 
million 
annually (or 
just 
over 
US 
$100/ha). 
With 
the 
Project: 
As 
a result 
of 
the 
rehabilitation, 
it 
has 
been 
assumed 
that 
silt 
entering 
the 
irrigation 
system 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
an 
average 
of 
2 
m3/ha/year over 
the command 
area 
of 
140,000 ha. 
The 
NPV 
of 
this 
cost 
saving 
would 
be 
around 
US 
$1 
million 
and 
would 
not 
alone 
be 
sufficient 
to 
justify 
the costs 
of 
the works. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
benefit 
of 
averting 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
headworks 
and 
the 
subsequent 
loss 
of 
irrigation 
to 
the 
140,000 
ha 
of 
command 
is 
substantial. 
If 
the 
headworks 
were 
to 
collapse at any 
time 
during 
the 
next 
20 
years, 
the 
consequent loss 
of 
the 
value 
of 
agricultural 
production 
cited 
in 
the 
WOP 
would 
easily 
exceed 
the 
costs 
of 
carrying 
out 
the 
works. 
Working 
on 
the assumption 
that a collapse 
of 
the 
headworks 
would 
occur 
in 
201012011, 
resulting 
in 
the 
equivalent 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
3 
years 
of 
agricultural 
production, 
the 
rate 
of 
return 
on 
the 
repair 
of 
Bahramtape 
would 
be 
39 
percent. 
This 
does 
not 
include 
any consideration 
of 
the 
benefit 
of 
avoiding 
disruption 
to 
the 
communities 
involved 
and 
their 
basic 
food 
supplies. 
Overall 
Project 
Economic Analysis 
Combining 
the 
results 
of 
the 
analyses 
of 
investments 
in 
WUA 
and 
Bahramtape 
rehabilitation 
with 
other 
project 
costs 
(including 
the 
costs 
of 
investments 
in 
training 
and development 
of 
WUAs 
as 
well 
as 
the 
construction 
of 
hydroposts) 
results 
in 
an 
EIRR 
of 
21 
percent 
for 
the 
project 
as 
a 
whole. 
Financial 
Analysis 
Financial 
analysis centers 
on 
investigating 
the 
financial 
returns 
to 
farmers 
from 
the 
improved 
irrigation 
infrastructure, 
and 
in 
turn 
on 
the 
sustainability 
of 
WUAs. 
The 
WUAs 
would 
be 
dependent 
on 
farmers 
capacity 
to 
pay 
irrigation 
service 
fees 
sufficient 
to 
pay 
to 
cost 
of 
management, operation, 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
irrigation 
networks. 
Net 
farm 
earnings range 
from 
AZM 
2.2 
milliodyear 
to 
just 
over 
AZM 
12 
milliodyear, 
the range 
depending 
not 
only on holding 
size 
and ownership 
of 
livestock, 
but 
also 
on 
potential 
for 
cash 
crop 
development. 
Farm 
incomes 
of 
both 
middle-income and 
poor 
families 
were 
estimated, 
with 
net 
farm 
earnings 
of 
middle-income 
families 
calculated 
at 
around 
AZM 
10 
milliodyear 
(US 
$2,00O/year) 
and 
those 
of 
poorer families 
at around 
AZM 
4 
milliodyear 
(US$ 
8OOlyear). 
Poor families 
all 
have 
farm 
earnings 
below 
the 
absolute 
poverty 
line 
(taken 
as 
AZM 
7.2 
milliodyear for 
a 
family 
of 
5). 
Farm 
earnings 
are 
supplemented 
by 
pension 
and 
wage payments, 
but 
these 
are 
still 
often insufficient 
to 
raise 
the 
families 
above 
the 
poverty 
line. 
About 
half 
of 
the 
net 
farm 
earnings 
of 
middle-income families 
are 
deemed 
to 
be received 
in 
cash, 
while for 
poorer families 
this 
proportion 
is 
typically 
only 
about 
a 
quarter. 
Land 
taxes 
and current water 
charges 
normally 
constitute a 
small 
proportion 
of 
net 
farm 
income, 
but 
for 
poorer families 
they 
can 
represent 
20 
to 
30 percent 
of 
the 
cash earnings. 
With 
the 
project, 
total 
charges 
for 
water 
by 
WUAs 
would 
rise 
substantially 
above 
the water 
fees 
currently 
charged 
(AZM 
10,325 
to 
18,438 
per 
ha or 
about 
US 
$2 
to 
3.75 
per 
ha). 
The 
average 
cost 
of 
WUA 
O&M 
is 
estimated 
at 
around 
US 
$15 
per 
ha. 
In 
addition, 
since 
SAICs  current 
ISF 
is 
set 
at 
a 
level 
which 
covers 
less 
than 
5 
percent 
of 
the 
estimated 
cost 
of 
operating 
and 
maintaining 
the 
off-farm 
irrigation 
network, 
it 
should 
not 
be 
reduced. 
To 
at 
least 
maintain 
SAICs  current 
revenue 
from 
water 
fees, 
a 
volumetric 
fee 
of 
about 
AZM 
2 
per 
m3 
would 
be 
required. 
WUAs 
would 
need 
to 
charge 
around 7 
times 
this 
current service 
fee 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
cover 
their 
costs 
of 
operation and 
maintenance 
as 
well. 
In 
the 
rehabilitated 
WAS: 
It 
is 
anticipated that 
systems 
would 
become 
fully 
operational,

Page  75
irrigation 
frequency 
would 
rise 
and 
significant 
yield 
increases 
would 
result.  Analysis 
of 
a 
total 
of 
12 
farm 
models 
indicates that 
net 
farm 
earnings 
are 
anticipated 
to 
rise 
by 
about 
AZM 
0.8 
to 
0.9 
million 
per 
year 
(US 
$165 
to 
190 
per 
year), 
while 
the 
increase 
in 
water 
fees 
per 
farm 
would 
amount 
to 
between 
AZM 
54,000 
per 
year 
(US 
$1 
1 
per 
year) 
and 
AZM 
272,000 
per 
year 
(US 
$56 
per 
year). 
At 
an 
ISF 
of 
AZM 
2 
per 
m3, 
the 
required 
increase 
in 
WUA 
charges 
would 
in 
no 
case 
exceed 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
expected 
increase 
in 
farm 
earnings, 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
it 
would 
be 
considerably 
lower. 
For 
middle-income families 
it 
would 
represent 
5 percent 
or 
less 
of 
total 
cash 
earnings 
and 
for 
poor 
families 
up 
to 
18 
percent 
of 
total 
cash 
earnings. 
At 
this 
level, 
the 
charges 
should 
be 
readily 
affordable. 
Should 
the 
ISF 
rise 
to 
AZM 
10 
per 
m3 
(a 
level 
which would 
cover 
about 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
estimated 
costs 
of 
O&M 
of 
the 
off-farm 
systems), 
then 
total 
charges 
for 
some 
farmers 
would 
rise 
above 
50 percent 
of 
the 
expected increase 
in 
farm 
earnings.

If 
irrigation 
does 
not

either 
because

to 
the 
WUA,

Main 
Assumptions: 
The 
main 
assumptions 
are 
mentioned 
as 
each 
step 
in 
the 
analysis 
is 
discussed 
above. 
In 
addition, 
the 
overall 
analysis 
assumes 
an 
exchange 
rate 
of 
US 
$1 
= 
AZM 
4,885 
and 
an opportunity 
cost 
of 
capital 
of 
12 
percent. 
The 
most 
recent 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(December 
17, 
2002) 
holds 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
appreciable change 
in 
the 
exchange 
rate 
through 
2010. 
However, sensitivity 
analysis was 
conducted 
(see 
below) 
to 
estimate 
the 
impact 
on 
the rate 
of 
return 
of 
a 
20 
percent appreciation 
of 
the 
AZM 
against 
the 
US 
Dollar. 
Sensitivity analysis 
/ 
Switching 
values 
of 
critical 
items: 
For 
the 
economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
WUA 
system 
rehabilitation 
investments, 
five 
sensitivity 
analyses 
were 
run: 
(i> 
simulating 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
20 
percent appreciation 
of 
the 
AZM 
against the 
dollar 
after 
2006; 
(ii) 
assuming 
no 
change 
in 
cropping pattern and 
no 
increase 
in 
area 
cropped 
for 
the 
WIP 
scenario; 
(iii) 
assuming 
a 
cropping pattern containing 
only 
6 percent 
high 
value 
crops 
(potatoes, 
fruit 
and 
vegetables), 
instead 
of 
the 
11 
percent 
assumed 
for 
the 
WIP 
scenario; 
(iv) 
a 
combination 
of 
(ii) 
and 
(iii); 
and 
(v) 
a 
combination 
of 
(i) 
and 
(ii). 
Even 
the 
most pessimistic 
of 
these 
possible 
scenarios 
results 
in 
acceptable 
returns. 
The 
results 
are 
presented 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
Sensitivity 
analysis was also 
conducted 
on 
the cost estimates 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
Bahramtape 
Headworks. 
The 
results 
suggest 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
rehabilitation could 
increase 
by 
over 450 
percent 
and 
the 
investment 
would 
still 
yield 
an acceptable 
economic rate 
of 
return 
of 
12 
percent.

& 
MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT 
PROJECT 
Procurement 
Procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
works 
would 
be 
done 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank's 
Guidelines 
Procurement under 
IBRD 
Loans 
and 
IDA 
Credits 
(issued 
in 
January 
1995, 
revised 
January 
and 
August 
1996, 
September 
1997, 
and 
January 
1999). 
The 
Borrower 
would 
use 
the 
Bank's 
standard 
bidding 
documents 
for 
goods and works, 
including 
standard 
evaluation 
reports. 
Consulting 
services 
and technical 
assistance 
would 
be 
procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Guidelines 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World Bank Borrowers 
(January 
1997, 
revised 
September 
1997, 
January 
1999, 
and 
May 
2002). 
The 
Bank's Standard 
Request 
for 
Proposals 
and Forms 
of 
Consultants' 
Contract 
would 
be 
used. 
A 
General Procurement 
Notice 
(GPN) was 
published 
on 
April 
30,2003 
in 
issue 
605 
of 
the 
U.N. 
Development 
Business 
and 
also 
in 
a 
national 
newspaper. 
Procurement 
Responsibilities 
At 
the 
country 
level, 
a comprehensive analysis 
of 
the 
public 
procurement 
system 
in 
Azerbaijan, 
including 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework, 
institutional 
capacity, enforcement regime, was 
carried 
out 
during 
the 
Country 
Procurement Assessment 
Review 
(CPAR) 
in 
2002. 
The 
CPAR 
emphasizes 
the 
advanced 
state 
of 
the 
procurement 
legislation 
and 
the existence 
of 
an 
appropriate and 
competent 
regulatory 
framework.  Azerbaijan's 
public 
procurement 
law 
is 
based 
on 
the 
UNCITRAL 
model, 
and 
is 
generally 
satisfactory. 
There 
is 
a State 
Procurement 
Agency 
with 
appropriate 
duties, 
and 
which 
is 
active 
in 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
the 
public 
procurement 
law. 
However, the 
capacity 
and 
recourses 
of 
the 
procurement 
system 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened substantially, 
and 
there 
is 
still 
little 
experience 
in 
the 
country 
with 
competitive procurement. 
The 
CPAR 
assesses 
Azerbaijan 
as 
a 
"medium 
to 
high 
risk" 
country 
from 
a 
procurement 
point 
of 
view. 
Responsibility 
for 
all 
procurement 
would 
rest 
with 
the 
PKJ, 
which 
is 
already 
in 
place 
with 
qualified 
national 
experts, 
recruited 
on 
competitive 
basis, 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
ongoing RIDIP. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
PIU's capacity 
to 
conduct procurement 
for 
the 
proposed 
IDSMIP 
as 
well 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
December 2002. 
The 
PIU 
has 
been 
operational 
for 
over 
two 
years 
and 
has 
performed 
well. 
The 
assessment 
addressed 
the 
legal 
aspects, 
procurement 
cycle 
management, 
organization and functions 
of 
the 
procurement 
team 
in 
the 
PIU, support and 
control 
systems, 
record 
keeping, 
and staffing. 
The 
staff 
of 
the 
PKJ 
includes 
a 
full-time 
procurement 
specialist, 
who 
has 
received 
training 
in 
Bank 
procurement 
guidelines and 
applications, 
and 
acquired 
good 
experience 
in 
procurement 
under 
the 
RIDIP. 
The 
PKJ 
Director, 
who 
received procurement 
training 
in 
Turin, 
has 
also experience 
in 
procurement, 
and 
provides 
oversight 
to 
the 
procurement 
team. 
Procurement 
activities 
are 
generally satisfactory 
and 
no 
major 
problems 
were 
identified 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
RIDIP 
so 
far. 
The 
procurement 
assessment 
rated 
the 
PIU 
procurement 
capacity 
as 
"Average 
risk", 
as 
it 
is 
not 
facing many 
of 
the problems and 
issues 
identified 
at country 
level 
by 
the 
CPAR. 
Following 
a 
recommendation 
of 
the 
procurement 
assessment, 
recruitment 
of 
one 
procurement 
assistant 
has 
already taken 
place, 
initially to work 
on 
RIDIP 
procurement, 
but, 
subject 
to 
satisfactory 
performance, 
to work 
on IDSMIP 
procurement 
in 
future. 
Procurement 
staff 
would 
be 
shared 
between 
the 
two 
projects, 
each 
with 
primary 
responsibility 
specific 
either 
to RIDIP 
and 
IDSMIP, 
but 
able 
to provide 
back-up support 
as 
needed. 
In 
collaboration 
with 
the 
PIU 
an action 
plan 
has 
been prepared 
to 
strengthen 
PWs 
capacity 
to 
administer 
procurement 
for 
the 
proposed 
IDSMIP. 
The 
plan 
includes: 
(i) 
the 
recruitment 
of 
an additional 
- 
73 
- 
Page  78
procurement 
staff 
before Credit 
effectiveness (already completed); 
(ii) 
a procurement 
book 
containing 
a 
full 
set 
of 
the 
latest 
Bank 
standard procurement documents 
would 
be 
provided to 
the 
PIU 
before 
effectiveness; 
(iii) 
the 
project launch 
workshop, 
which 
is 
scheduled 
for 
September 
2003, 
would 
have 
a 
session 
on 
procurement 
principles 
and 
arrangements; 
(iv) 
the 
Task 
Team 
Leader (TTL), 
who 
is 
a PAS, 
would 
review project 
procurement 
activities 
during 
every supervision mission, 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
guidance 
and support 
to 
the 
PIU 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
procurement 
plan 
and activities; 
(v) 
the 
PIU 
would 
establish 
a 
computerized 
monitoring 
system, 
similar 
to 
the 
one 
for 
RIDIP, before 
the 
first 
procurement 
takes 
place; 
and 
(vi) 
a 
minimum 
of 
one 
in 
every 
five 
contracts 
representing 
different 
procurement 
methods (not subject 
to 
prior 
IDA 
review) 
would 
be reviewed 
on 
an 
ex-post basis 
during 
project 
implementation. 
The 
TTL 
would 
get 
assistance 
from 
a 
senior 
Bank 
procurement 
specialist 
for 
this. 
Information 
regarding 
procurement 
administration 
would 
be collected 
and recorded 
in 
the 
quarterly 
progress reports. 
The 
information 
would 
include: 
(i) 
cost estimates 
for individual 
contracts 
and 
the 
total 
project; 
(ii) 
timing 
for 
procurement 
actions, 
including 
contract 
completion 
times; 
and 
(iii) 
an 
updated procurement 
plan. 
The 
PIU 
prepares satisfactory 
quarterly Project 
Status 
Reports 
for 
RIDIP, 
incorporating Project 
Management 
Reports (PMR). 
A 
similar format 
of 
reporting 
would 
be 
followed 
for 
IDSMIP. 
The 
project 
would 
work 
with 
many 
WUAs, 
who 
would 
be 
involved 
in 
prioritizing 
design 
interventions, and supervising 
implementation 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
works 
within 
the 
command 
areas 
of 
their 
management. 
All 
procurement responsibilities would, 
however, 
rest 
with 
the 
PIU. 
Procurement 
Methods 
(Table 
A) 
The 
investment 
part 
of 
the 
project 
would 
include 
procurement 
of 
works, goods 
and 
services. 
A 
detailed 
procurement 
plan 
is 
included 
in 
the 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
about 142 
IDA 
financed 
contracts 
would 
be 
generated 
during 
project 
implementation, 
of 
which 
60 
would 
be 
for 
procurement 
of 
works, 
42 
contracts 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods, 
and 
40 
for 
procurement 
of 
consulting 
services. 
The 
procurement 
arrangements 
are 
described 
in 
the 
next 
paragraphs, 
which 
also 
indicate 
the 
applicable 
thresholds, 
which 
are 
very similar 
to 
the 
ones 
recommended 
in 
the 
CPAR. 
The 
aggregate 
amount 
for 
each 
procurement 
method 
is 
given 
in 
table 
A. 
Civil 
Works. 
The project 
would 
carry 
out 
rehabilitation 
works 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
in 
11 
raions 
of 
Azerbaijan. 
Civil 
works 
would 
include 
rehabilitation 
of: 
(i) 
off-farm 
infrastructure, 
including 
headworks, 
primary 
and 
secondary 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
canals, 
and 
hydraulic 
structures; 
and 
(ii) 
on-farm 
infrastructure, consisting 
of 
tertiary and 
lower 
order 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
networks, 
including 
structures. 
International 
Competitive 
Bidding 
(ICB). 
All 
civil 
works 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$ 
600,000 
or 
more 
per 
contract 
would 
be procured according 
to ICB. 
This 
includes 
large works 
such 
as 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
Bahramtape headworks, 
with 
a 
cost estimate 
of 
US 
$4.2 
million. 
Other 
ICB 
contracts 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US 
$1.3 
million 
in 
aggregate 
would 
include 
rehabilitation 
of 
some 
of 
the 
larger 
off-farm 
systems. 
In 
the 
comparison 
of 
bids 
for 
civil 
works procured though 
ICB, 
a 
domestic 
preference 
would 
apply 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
procurement guidelines. 
National 
Competitive 
Bidding 
(NCB). 
Works 
estimated 
to 
cost 
between 
US 
$50,000 
and 
US 
$600,000 
would 
be 
procured through 
NCB. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
45 
WUAs 
would 
participate, 
with 
an 
average 
on-farm investment 
of 
US$375,000, 
with 
a range 
from 
about 
US 
$150,000 
to 
US 
$600,000. 
WUAs 
would 
be 
selected 
depending 
on 
the 
status 
of 
their 
development, 
and 
according 
to 
a number 
of 
- 
74 
- 
Page  79
criteria 
that 
have 
been detailed 
in 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan.  Sub-projects 
benefiting 
the 
WUAs 
would 
be implemented 
under 
close 
supervision 
of 
the 
PIU 
and 
respective 
WUA 
management. 
Rehabilitation 
of 
some 
of 
the 
off-farm 
systems 
and 
the 
hydroposts 
would 
also 
be conducted 
through 
an 
estimated 
12 
NCB 
contracts. 
Given 
the 
anticipated small contract 
values 
and 
the 
dispersed 
location 
of 
the 
sub-projects, 
ICB 
is 
not 
expected 
for 
on-farm rehabilitation 
works. 
Most 
of 
the 
civil 
works 
contracts 
for 
WUA 
command 
areas 
would 
be 
relatively 
simple and straightforward, 
comprising 
mainly 
canal and 
drainage cleaning, 
repair 
of 
canal 
lining, 
and 
rehabilitation and construction 
of 
hydraulic 
structures. 
Experience 
of 
the FPP 
has 
shown 
that 
there 
is 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
local 
contractors 
with 
adequate 
capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
such 
kind 
of 
works. 
The 
performance 
of 
national 
contractors under 
RIDIP 
has 
also 
generally been 
satisfactory. 
Sufficient 
interest 
and 
capacity 
is 
envisaged 
to provide 
a 
competitive 
environment. 
ECA 
sample 
NCB 
bidding 
documents 
would 
be 
used, 
with 
which 
the 
PIU 
is 
familiar. 
The 
procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
for 
NCB 
would 
be 
those 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
Law 
of 
Azerbaijan. 
Clarifications 
required 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Guidelines 
for 
Procurement 
under 
IBRD 
Loans 
and 
IDA 
Credits 
has 
been 
provided 
in 
a 
supplemental 
letter 
on 
NCB 
procedures. 
The 
letter 
has 
been 
annexed 
in 
the PIP. 
Minor 
Works 
(Mv. 
Works 
valued 
at 
less 
than 
US 
$50,000 
per 
contract 
would 
be procured 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
at 
least 
three 
price 
quotations. 
The 
invitation 
to

shall include 
a 
detailed description 
of 
the

including 
basic specifications, the 
required

date, 
a 
basic 
form 
of 
agreement 
acceptable 
to 
the Association, 
and 
relevant

where applicable. 
The award 
of 
contract 
shall 
be 
made 
to 
the contractor 
who 
offers 
the 
lowest 
price 
quotation 
for 
the 
required 
works, 
and 
who 
was 
the 
experience 
and

to 
be 
used 
for

renovations. 
Goods. 
The 
goods 
to 
be 
financed 
in 
the 
project 
would 
include 
vehicles, 
motor-cycles, 
office 
equipment, 
environmental 
monitoring 
equipment, 
furniture, 
and various 
small 
equipment 
for 
WUAs 
(e.g. 
office 
equipment, 
small 
maintenance 
machinery, 
and 
field 
testing 
equipment). 
For 
goods packages 
estimated 
to 
cost 
more 
than 
US 
$100,000 
each, 
ICB 
procedures 
shall 
be 
used. 
For 
the 
purchase 
of 
goods 
to 
be 
awarded 
through 
ICB, 
the 
Borrower 
may 
grant 
a 
margin 
preference 
of 
15 
percent 
to 
qualified 
domestic manufacturers, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Guidelines referred 
to 
above. 
International 
shopping 
(IS), 
based 
on 
comparison 
of 
quotes 
from 
at 
least three 
suppliers 
from two 
eligible 
countries, 
shall 
be 
used 
for 
contracts estimated 
to 
cost 
between 
US 
$50,000 
and 
US 
$100,000 
per 
package. 
Alternatively 
IAPSO 
of 
the 
United 
nations 
could 
be 
used 
to 
source 
such 
goods. 
National 
Shopping 
(NS) 
would 
be 
used 
for 
contracts 
for 
goods estimated 
to 
cost 
less 
than 
US$ 
50,000 
per 
contract, 
to 
be 
awarded 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
three 
written price 
quotations 
from 
local 
suppliers. 
The 
procurement 
of 
goods 
for 
the 45 
WUAs 
(US 
$1,941,000 
in 
aggregate) 
would 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
PIU 
through 
a number 
of 
packages 
throughout the 
project 
duration. 
The 
composition 
of 
the 
packages 
would 
to 
a 
certain 
extent depend 
on 
the 
demand 
of 
the 
WUAs, 
but 
is 
expected 
to 
include 
equipment 
such 
as 
computer, 
motorcycle, 
two-way 
radio, 
field 
testing 
devices, 
small 
canal 
maintenance 
machinery, 
and 
office 
furniture. 
Goods 
to 
be 
procured 
for 
the 
qualifying 
WUAs 
would 
be 
consolidated 
to 
the extent practicable 
into 
a 
number 
of 
bid 
packages 
or 
lots 
depending 
on 
their 
composition 
to 
achieve 
economy 
of 
scale 
and 
facilitate 
contract 
management. 
It 
is 
foreseen 
that 
this 
procurement 
would 
take 
place 
for 
different 
locations 
and 
at 
different times 
during 
project 
implementation through 
50 
percent 
IS 
and 
50 
percent 
NS, 
depending 
on 
the 
value 
of 
the 
packages. 
The 
procurement 
plan 
for 
goods 
would 
be 
updated 
by

Consultant 
Services. 
Additional 
PIU 
staff 
would 
be 
recruited 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis 
as 
individual 
consultants, 
initially 
for 
one 
year, 
with 
the 
possibility 
of 
extension 
upon 
satisfactory 
performance. 
National individual 
consultants 
would 
be 
recruited 
to 
provide 
specialized technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
legislation, 
community mobilization, environmental monitoring, 
training 
and 
information 
dissemination. 
Intemational 
short-term 
consultants 
would 
be recruited 
by 
SAIC 
and 
PIU 
for 
specialized 
design 
tasks 
(e.g. 
modem 
hydraulic 
structures).  Such 
individual 
specialists 
would 
have 
specific 
skills 
needed 
for 
short 
periods 
of 
time 
during 
the 
first 
years 
of 
the 
project. 
All 
individual 
consultants 
would 
be 
selected 
in 
accordance 
with 
Part 
V 
of 
the Consultant Guidelines. 
National 
consultants, 
including 
PIU 
staff, cannot 
be 
civil 
servants. 
Design 
and 
supervision 
services 
for 
the 
on-farm 
and 
off-farm 
rehabilitation works 
would 
be 
procured through 
QCBS.  Considering that most 
of 
the 
field 
investigations, 
surveys, 
design and 
supervision 
activities 
are 
relatively 
easy, 
active 
participation 
of 
national consulting 
firms 
as 
sub-consultants 
is 
anticipated. 
There 
would 
be 
a 
separate 
QCBS contract 
for 
design 
and 
supervision 
of 
Bahramtape 
weir, 
which 
requires specialized 
expertise. 
A 
Technical 
Assistance 
(TA) 
team 
to provide 
technical 
expertise 
in 
WUA 
development 
would 
be 
procured through 
QCBS. 
It 
is 
important 
that 
these 
services commence soon 
after 
project 
effectiveness. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference have already been 
drafted 
and 
the 
approved 
Request 
for 
Proposals 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
ready 
early 
June 
2003. 
The 
Special Procurement 
Notice 
has 
been 
published 
in 
the 
UN 
Development 
Business 
of 
May 
16,2003. 
Three 
separate 
monitoring 
and 
agricultural 
studies 
would 
be carried 
out 
by 
national consulting 
firms, 
to 
be 
recruited through 
Consultants' 
Qualifications. 
The 
contract 
with 
the 
audit 
firm 
for RIDIP 
would 
be 
amended 
to 
include 
the 
annual 
audit of 
the 
IDSMIP 
accounts. 
This 
would 
allow 
for 
consistency 
and 
ensure 
that 
through 
one 
audit 
there 
would 
be 
an overview 
of 
the 
whole financial 
management 
situation 
of 
the 
projects 
under 
the 
management 
responsibility 
of 
the 
PIU.  The 
contract 
for 
the 
project 
audit 
would 
be 
renewable every 
year subject 
to 
satisfactory performance. 
In 
case 
the 
Implementing 
Agency 
would 
not 
opt 
to 
renew 
the contract, subject 
to 
agreement 
with 
IDA, 
the 
Least-Cost 
Selection 
method 
would 
have 
to 
be 
used 
for 
the 
recruitment 
of 
new 
auditors. 
Training. 
Training 
and 
study 
tours 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
according 
to 
a 
training 
plan 
with 
budget 
estimates, 
which 
the 
PIU 
would 
revise 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
and 
submit 
to 
IDA 
for 
approval 
prior 
to 
implementation. 
The 
total 
estimated 
budget 
for 
training 
and 
study 
tours 
is 
US 
$763,000. 
Incremental Operating 
Costs. 
The project 
would 
finance incremental operating 
costs 
of 
about 
US 
$1,250,000 
(US 
$930,000 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
IDA), 
consisting 
of 
incremental 
operating 
costs 
for 
the 
PIU 
and 
WUA 
support 
units, 
incurred 
as 
a 
result 
of 
IDSMIP 
implementation. 
These 
costs 
would 
include: 
(i) 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
equipment and 
vehicles; 
(ii) 
travel 
allowances 
paid 
to 
WUA 
support 
units 
at 
central 
and 
raion 
level 
and 
PIU 
staff; 
(iii) 
office 
supplies 
and communications; 
(iv) 
support 
staff; 
(v) 
eligible 
social 
charges; 
and 
(vi) 
bank 
charges 
and 
other miscellaneous 
expenditures. 
The 
costs 
would 
be 
procured 
on 
the basis 
of 
an 
annual 
budget 
to 
be 
agreed 
with 
the 
Association.  Government 
would 
fully 
finance 
the 
office 
rent 
for 
PIU 
and 
SUs, 
and 
the 
staff 
costs 
of 
all 
SU 
personnel.

by 
independent 
auditors 
in 
accordance 
with 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
(ISA) promulgated 
by

Disbursement Arrangements 
The 
IDA 
Credit 
of 
US$35.0 
million 
would 
be 
disbursed under 
traditional 
Bank 
procedures 
(reimbursements 
with 
full 
documentation, Statement 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOE), 
direct 
payments 
and special 
commitments).  Reimbursement 
of 
hnds 
would 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
PIU 
through 
deposits 
to 
the 
Special Account. 
Minimum 
size 
of 
application 
for 
direct withdrawals and 
issuance 
of 
letters 
of 
Special 
Commitments 
from 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
account 
would 
be 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
Authorized 
Allocation 
to 
the 
Special Account. 
A 
condition 
for 
disbursement 
would 
be 
that 
no 
withdrawals shall 
be 
made 
in 
respect 
of 
Works: 
(i) 
until 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
Law 
on 
Amelioration 
and 
Irrigation 
have been 
enacted, 
in 
substance 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Association; and 
(ii) 
for 
each 
rehabilitation 
works, 
both 
on-farm 
and 
off-farm, 
until 
a 
satisfactory report 
on 
the 
proposal 
has 
been submitted 
to 
the Association. 
The 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement includes 
an outline 
of 
the 
information 
that 
is 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
reports. 
Payment 
for 
most 
of 
these 
works 
would 
be 
on 
the basis 
of 
SOEs. 
The 
PIU 
should 
attach 
the 
no-objection 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
each system 
to 
the 
withdrawal 
applications. 
This 
no-objection 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
proposal 
would 
be 
in 
addition to 
the 
no-objection 
for

audit report 
for 
the 
fiscal 
year 
in 
which 
the

was

During 
the 
initial

allocation 
of 
the

would 
be

to

the 
level 
of 
SDR 
4 
million, 
the 
initial 
allocation may 
be 
increased 
up 
to 
the 
authorized 
allocation 
of 
US 
$1,000,000, 
by 
submitting 
the 
relevant 
withdrawal 
application 
form. 
Replenishment applications 
would 
be submitted 
at 
least 
every 
three months, and 
include reconciled 
bank 
statements 
as 
well 
as 
other 
appropriate 
supporting 
documents. 
The 
PIU 
would 
maintain 
a 
separate 
bank 
account 
(in 
local 
currency) 
to 
receive 
and manage government counterpart 
contributions. 
Small 
sums 
of 
money 
would 
be required 
for 
the operation 
of 
the 
11 
raion 
Support 
Units 
to 
cover 
expenditures such 
as 
computer and 
office 
supplies, 
communication, 
subsistence, 
O&M 
for 
vehicles, 
training, 
and 
other 
costs agreed 
with 
the 
Association. 
Each 
Support 
Unit 
would 
open a 
bank 
account 
in 
the 
local 
branch 
of 
the 
International 
Bank 
of 
Azerbaijan 
or 
other 
commercial 
banks 
that 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
executing 
foreign 
exchange and 
local 
currency 
transactions 
promptly 
and 
capable 
of 
issuing 
prompt 
monthly 
bank 
statements, 
while 
charging 
reasonable 
fees 
for 
their 
services. 
The 
PIU 
would 
transfer 
60-day 
advances 
to 
the 
local 
bank 
accounts 
on 
the basis 
of 
an estimate 
provided 
by 
the 
Support 
Units. 
Typically 
the 
advance 
would 
not 
exceed 
US 
$400 
per 
Support 
Unit, 
and 
would 
be 
for 
expenditures 
as 
defined 
under 
Training 
and Incremental Operating 
Costs 
in 
Schedule 
1 
of 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement. 
The 
advances 
would 
be reconciled 
once 
every 
two 
months 
or 
when 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
funds 
have 
been 
utilized, 
at 
which 
time 
the Support 
Units 
would 
provide 
the 
PIU 
with 
receipts and 
estimates 
for 
the 
next 
60-days 
operational 
budget. 
Since the 
Borrower 
would 
be 
empowered 
to 
manage 
and 
account 
for 
funds 
which 
are 
advanced 
from 
the 
Special Account, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
that 
minimum 
safeguards 
are 
put 
in 
place. 
The 
PIU 
would 
have 
the 
overall responsibility 
for 
maintaining 
proper 
books 
of 
accounts 
for 
the 
project 
funds, 
allocate 
funds 
to 
the decentralized locations 
based 
on 
identified 
and 
justified 
implementation 
needs, 
and 
closely 
supervise 
and 
monitor 
this 
decentralized 
flow 
of 
funds. 
The 
PIU 
has 
already 
designed 
a 
standard 
reporting 
format, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
get 
consistent 
financial reporting 
from 
all 
the Support 
Units. 
The 
PIU 
would not 
make 
hrther 
advances 
to 
the 
Support 
Units 
until 
proper accounting 
has 
been 
received 
fiom 
them. 
Financial 
Covenants. 
The 
PIU 
would 
maintain 
an 
adequate 
financial 
management system 
and 
furnish 
to 
IDA 
quarterly 
FMRs 
on 
the 
financial, 
monitoring 
and procurement 
management 
activities. 
As 
indicated 
above, 
independent 
extemal 
auditors under terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
would 
audit 
the 
Project 
Financial 
Statements, 
the Special 
Account 
and 
disbursements 
made 
on 
basis 
of 
SOEs, 
and 
submit 
the audit 
report 
to 
IDA 
no 
later than six 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each year audited. 
Supervision 
Plan. 
The Association 
would 
conduct 
financial 
management 
supervision every 
six 
months 
to monitor 
progress 
of 
project 
implementation. 
The 
financial 
management 
supervision 
would 
pay 
particular attention 
to: 
(i) 
disbursements 
and 
financial 
management arrangements 
including review 
of 
SOEs; 
(ii) 
review 
of 
project's 
financial monitoring 
reports and audited 
financial 
statements; 
and 
(iii) 
review 
of 
implementation 
of 
progress 
of 
remedial 
actions recommended 
in 
the 
Auditors 
Management 
Letters.

AZERBAIJAN: IRRIGATION DISTRIBUTION 
SYSTEM 
& 
MANAGEMENT 
IMPROVEMENT 
PROJECT 
Project 
Description 
At 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Azerbaijan, 
the 
IDA 
prepared 
an 
Irrigation Distribution 
System 
and 
Management Improvement 
Project (IDSMIP).  The 
IDSMP 
would 
support 
the 
development 
of 
Azerbaijans 
Water 
User 
Associations 
(WUAs) 
and 
finance 
rehabilitation 
of 
associated 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
The 
infrastructure improvements 
would 
be 
made 
on 
a demand-driven 
basis 
with 
WUAs 
that 
meet 
certain 
eligibility 
criteria 
in 
the 
project 
area 
raions 
in 
Azerbaijan 
(Aghjabedi, 
Beylagan, 
Geranboy, 
Guba, 
Imishli, 
Khachmaz, Saatli, 
Sabirabad, 
Zardab) 
and 
in 
the 
Autonomous 
Republic 
of 
Nakhchivan 
(Babek, Sharur). 
Some 
associated 
off-farm 
infrastructure improvements 
(including 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
Bahramtape headworks) 
would 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
effective delivery 
of 
water 
to 
the 
rehabilitated on-farm 
systems. 
Environmental 
Assessment 
(EA) 
The 
EA 
has been prepared 
for 
the proposed 
project 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
it 
incorporates sound 
environmental 
management 
principles 
and practices 
and 
complies 
with 
World 
Bank 
environmental 
safeguards 
as 
well 
as 
with 
Azerbaijani 
environmental 
requirements. 
The 
EA 
examined proposed 
project 
activities, 
the 
environmental 
policy, and 
the 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
in 
Azerbaijan. 
It 
also 
examined 
the 
existing situation 
in 
the 
project 
area 
to 
identify 
the 
environmental and 
social 
impacts 
of 
the 
proposed project, 
both 
positive 
and negative, 
and 
specify appropriate 
preventive 
actions 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
prevent, 
eliminate 
or 
minimize 
anticipated 
adverse 
impacts 
and 
to 
ensure 
the 
projects 
compliance 
with 
Azerbaijani 
legislation. 
Furthermore, 
the 
EA 
proposed 
certain 
institutional 
arrangements, 
capacity-building 
and 
monitoring 
activities 
to 
ensure 
that the 
prevention 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
implemented. 
The 
EA 
has 
been 
prepared 
by 
a 
team 
of 
international environmental 
experts 
from 
the 
UN 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
Organization 
(FAO), 
worhng 
together 
with 
the 
Environmental 
Specialist 
of 
the 
Project Implementation 
Unit 
(PIU) 
and 
national environmental 
experts. 
Consultations 
The 
EA 
team 
began 
consulting 
stakeholders 
and beneficiaries 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
during 
its 
first 
three missions. 
It 
met 
with 
officials 
in 
the 
SAIC, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Ecology 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
and other 
national 
institutions; 
with 
local 
SAIC 
officials 
and 
WUA 
members 
in 
the 
raions; 
with 
environmental NGOs; and 
with 
farmers 
and 
other 
beneficiaries. 
Public 
consultations 
were 
organized 
during 
the 
fourth 
mission 
in 
Baku 
and 
Sabirabad 
to 
inform 
project 
beneficiaries 
and stakeholders 
of 
the 
findings 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
EA, 
discuss 
and 
improve 
understanding 
of 
the 
potential 
impacts 
of 
the 
project, 
review 
the 
proposed 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
ensure 
their 
adequacy, 
appropriateness 
and 
acceptability, 
and 
receive and incorporate 
comments 
from 
consultation 
participants. 
Main 
Anticipated 
Positive 
Impacts 
Improved 
Agricultural 
Productivity. 
Infrastructure 
rehabilitation 
should 
enhance 
productivity 
by 
both 
improving irrigation 
water 
delivery 
and 
bringing 
fallow 
lands 
back 
into 
production. 
Strengthened 
WUAs 
should 
improve 
water resourceslsoil 
fertility 
management 
and 
promote 
consistent 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage structures.

Increased 
Farm 
Income, 
Alleviation 
of 
Poverty. 
Assuming 
improvements 
in 
agncultural 
marketing 
and 
ago-industries 
as 
well 
as 
access 
to 
credit 
and extension services 
over 
time, 
increased 
agricultural 
productivity 
and 
return 
to 
cash crops 
should 
lead 
to 
increases 
in 
farm 
family 
incomes, 
improved 
employment, and a 
reduction 
in 
rural 
poverty. 
Improvement 
in 
Health. 
Drainage 
system 
improvements 
would 
reduce the 
areas 
of 
standing 
water where 
disease 
vectors 
multiply. 
Improved 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
these systems 
should 
encourage farmers 
to 
improve 
health conditions 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Reduction 
in 
Water 
Losses, 
Soil 
Salinity, and 
Waterlogging. 
The 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
systems 
would 
reduce 
water 
losses, 
improve control 
of 
groundwater 
levels, 
and 
prevent 
soil 
salinization and 
waterlogging. 
Improved 
Water Resources 
Management. 
By 
strengthening 
WAS, 
encouraging better water 
measurement, 
enhancing 
irrigation 
service fee 
collection, 
and 
eliminating 
illegal 
abstractions, 
the 
IDSMIP would 
promote 
better 
control 
on 
water 
use 
and contribute 
to 
more 
rational 
water 
management. 
Potential Negative 
Impacts and 
Recommended 
Preventive 
and 
Mitigation 
Measures 
Construction Impacts. 
Mostly 
on-site, small-scale 
impacts 
on 
access 
and 
movement, 
agricultural 
activities, and vegetation and 
wildlife. 
Bahramtape headworks 
rehabilitation may 
involve 
additional 
construction 
impacts: 
water and 
soil pollution; 
disruption 
of 
the 
hydrological 
system, 
irrigation 
water 
supply 
and 
fisheries; 
damage 
to 
the 
river 
ecosystem 
or 
the surrounding 
landscape. 
Recommended 
Measures. 
Environmental, 
health and 
safety 
covenants have been 
incorporated 
in 
the 
bidding 
documents 
of 
construction 
contracts; 
environmental 
management 
guidelines 
for 
construction 
contractors; 
site-specific environmental 
management 
plans and 
related 
staff 
training; 
restrictions 
on 
the 
use 
of 
heavy 
machinery 
at 
ecologically 
sensitive 
sites. 
Management 
of 
Dredged 
Sediment 
and 
Concrete 
Debris. 
Indiscriminate 
dumping 
of 
sediments 
may 
cause 
loss 
of 
agricultural 
land, 
erosion 
and 
resilting 
of 
the 
canals. 
Contaminated 
sediments 
may 
adversely 
affect 
the 
natural 
environment and 
accumulate 
in 
crops.  Concrete 
debris 
and 
metal 
scrap, 
if 
dumped 
indiscriminately, 
would 
damage 
landscape 
and 
cause 
pollution. 
Recommended 
Measures. 
S 
ediment 
sampling 
prior to 
canal 
dredging; 
proper 
disposal 
of 
contaminated material; 
use 
of 
non-contaminated 
sediments 
for 
field 
levelling 
or 
as 
fill 
material; a 
waste management 
plan 
for 
concrete/metal waste 
to 
identify 
proper 
reuse 
and disposal opportunities. 
Articles 
would 
be 
incorporated 
in 
the 
technical specifications 
of 
the standard 
bidding 
documents. 
Decreased 
Downstream 
Water 
Quality. 
Main 
risks 
are 
increased drainage 
from 
saline 
soils 
and 
inadequate management 
of 
pumping 
station 
waste 
and, 
in 
the 
long-term, 
increases 
in 
ago-chemical 
use 
induced, 
indirectly 
and gradually, 
by 
productivity 
improvements and 
return 
to 
cash crops that 
the 
IDSMIP 
is 
expected 
to 
bring. 
Chemical over-application 
may 
be 
done 
by 
farmers unaware 
of 
risks 
and 
subsequent 
water 
pollution. 
Recommended 
Measures. 
Expose farmers 
through agricultural 
extension 
services 
to 
proper 
irrigation 
and 
other 
agricultural 
practices, 
Integrated 
Pest 
and 
Production 
Management 
(IPPM), 
proper 
agro-chemical 
application and 
storage methods, 
as 
well 
as 
awareness 
raising 
on 
the 
risks 
of 
obsoletebanned chemicals 
use. 
Guidance 
on 
proper 
pumping 
station 
management 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
pump 
operators. 
Reduction 
in 
Downstream 
River 
Flows. 
The project 
would 
not significantly 
increase 
irrigation 
water withdrawals. 
Present 
abstraction 
levels 
may, 
in 
dry 
years, 
conflict 
with 
ecological 
minimum 
flows.

Page  96
Recommended 
Measures. 
Installing 
river 
flow 
measuring 
equipment 
at 
headworks; 
promotion 
of 
water-conserving 
irrigation 
techniques; 
and a 
review 
of 
ecological 
minimum 
flow 
requirements 
to 
be 
initiated 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
Impacts 
on 
Agricultural 
Soils. 
Topsoil 
erosion 
due 
to 
inappropriate 
irrigation 
methods; 
canal 
erosion 
due 
to 
poor 
desigdconstruction; 
waterlogging 
and 
soil 
salinization 
caused 
by 
over-watering and 
poor 
subsurface drainage; 
leaching 
of 
nutrients 
and 
reduction 
in 
soil 
fertility 
caused 
by 
irrigation 
retum 
flows. 
Recommended Measures. 
Farmers 
would 
be 
encouraged 
to level 
land; 
reline 
canals susceptible 
to 
erosion 
and rehabilitate 
associated 
hydraulic 
structures; 
remove 
unauthorized 
connections 
to 
canals/drains; 
improve 
water 
distribution, 
management 
and 
irrigation 
practices; 
clear 
field 
drainage 
before 
each 
irrigation 
season; 
and introduce crop 
rotation 
cycles.  Sub-surface 
water 
level 
and 
quality 
monitoring 
to 
be carried 
out 
by 
WUAs. 
Reduction 
of 
Water Levels 
in 
Sensitive Wetlands. 
Any 
participating 
project 
site 
located 
close 
to 
sensitive 
wetland 
habitats 
(Lakes Ag-gel, Boz-Gobu, 
Mehman 
and 
Sarisu) 
might 
adversely 
affect 
the 
wetland 
ecosystems 
if 
they 
reduce 
the 
amount 
of 
water 
flowing 
or 
draining 
into 
them. 
Recommended 
Measures. 
Continue 
the 
FUDIP 
ecological wetland 
monitoring 
program, 
as 
needed; 
phase 
IDSMIP 
activities 
so 
that 
infrastructure 
on 
any 
WUA 
adjacent 
to 
sensitive 
wetlands 
would not 
be rehabilitated 
before 
adequate 
monitoring information 
is 
available; 
expert 
panel 
to review monitoring 
results 
and 
decide 
on 
mitigation 
measures 
if 
needed. 
Water 
Pollution 
on 
Sensitive Wetlands. 
Water 
salinity or ago-chemical 
pollution 
could 
have 
negative impacts 
on 
the 
shallow 
wetland 
habitats. 
Recommended 
Measures. 
Monitor 
the 
quality 
of 
inflowing 
drainage water; 
if 
needed, 
establish 
natural 
vegetation 
filters 
in 
the 
tail 
end 
of 
secondary 
drains 
or 
small, 
uncultivated 
buffer 
zones 
along 
the 
edges 
of 
field 
drains. 
Reduction 
of 
On-farm 
Habitat. 
Rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
would 
eliminate 
some 
of 
the 
mini-wetlands occurring 
in 
drainage canals 
and 
may 
damage 
vegetation 
along 
irrigation 
canals, 
potentially affecting 
habitats 
of 
rarelprotected 
species. 
Recommended 
Measures. 
Clean 
drainage canals 
only 
where 
this 
is 
needed 
to 
prevent salinity/waterlogging; 
perform 
site 
assessment 
before construction 
to 
identify 
any 
important 
habitatslsites located 
alongin 
the 
canals 
proposed 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
define 
appropriate site-specific 
preventive/mitigation 
measures. 
Irrigation 
Water-related 
Health 
Problems. 
Health 
impacts 
are 
primarily 
positive, 
but 
the 
availability 
of 
more 
irrigation 
water 
in 
the 
canals 
and 
collectors 
may 
also 
lead to 
increases 
in 
disease 
vectors, 
with 
associated 
risks 
where

Environmental 
Screening 
and 
Review 
The 
demand-driven 
nature 
of 
the 
IDSMIP 
means 
that 
the exact 
number 
and 
location 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation 
sub-projects 
to 
be 
financed 
have yet 
to 
be 
determined. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
-

Page  97
the 
appropriate 
preventive 
and 
mitigation 
measures are 
applied 
to 
specific 
sub-project 
rehabilitation 
sites 
on 
a 
case-by-case basis, 
the 
EA 
proposes 
environmental 
screening 
and 
review 
procedures. 
The 
initial 
screening 
would 
cover 
all 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation 
sub-projects. 
A 
sub-project 
would 
not 
be 
eligible 
if 
it 
involves: 
(i) 
construction 
of 
significant 
new 
irrigation 
or 
drainage 
systems; 
(ii) 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
river 
water; 
or 
(iii) 
conversion 
of 
important natural 
habitat 
into 
agricultural 
use. 
Furthermore, 
an 
environmental 
screening 
checklist 
would 
be 
completed 
on 
each 
sub-project 
by 
the 
WUA 
concerned 
to 
identify 
potential environmental 
impacts, 
suggest 
appropriate 
preventive and 
mitigation 
measures, 
and 
trigger, 
where 
appropriate, 
further 
environmental 
review 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Ecology 
and 
Natural 
Resources. 
The 
PIU 
would 
assist 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
checklists, 
approve 
them, 
supervise 
and 
monitor 
their 
implementation, 
and assist 
in 
possible 
ministry 
review. 
Monitoring 
Monitoring 
of 
the environmental 
and 
social impacts 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
performed 
by 
the 
PIU 
and 
the 
WAS. 
The 
PIU 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
implementation 
of 
general 
and site-specific 
mitigation 
measures, 
and 
monitoring 
of 
impact 
on 
wetlands, 
construction 
impacts, sediment sampling, 
subsurface 
water 
level 
and quality, and 
soil 
salinization. 
The 
WUAs 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
on-farm 
erosion 
and 
illegal 
connections, 
as 
well 
as 
assisting the 
PIU 
in 
monitoring 
on-farm 
subsurface 
water and 
soil 
salinization. 
An 
indication 
of 
the proposed environmental 
monitoring 
parameters, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
responsibility 
and 
schedule 
for 
monitoring 
them, 
is 
shown 
in 
the

are 
included 
in 
the 
project to 
ensure 
effective implementation 
of 
the 
mitigation 
measures. 
Environmental 
capacity 
building 
would 
include: 
(i) 
an 
environmental

in 
the 
PIU; 
(ii) 
support 
to 
the 
environmental specialist 
through 
technical 
training 
and environmental 
consultants; 
(iii) 
environmental 
training 
to 
PIU 
management 
and

through 
the 
IDA-funded 
Urgent Environmental 
Investment 
Project; and 
(vi) 
environmental 
support 
to 
SAIC 
through national 
experts. 
The 
EA 
identified 
several 
topics 
for 
agricultural 
extension 
to 
be 
provided 
in 
raions 
where 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
would 
be 
rehabilitated through 
the 
World 
Bank

Project, 
which 
is 
already 
being 
implemented 
in 
many 
of 
the 
areas 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
the 
IDSMIP.

Additional 
Annex 
12: 
Executive Summary 
of Social 
Assessment 
AZERBAIJAN: 
IRRIGATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
& 
MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT 
PROJECT 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
annex 
is 
to 
provide 
supplemental 
background 
and 
rationale 
for 
the 
social 
analysis 
presented 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
text 
in 
Section 
E.6, 
and 
to 
discuss 
Social Impact 
Monitoring.  The 
annex 
draws 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
and 
institutional 
assessment 
undertaken 
during 
project 
preparation, the 
social 
assessment 
for 
RIDIP, 
baseline 
survey 
for 
RIDIP, 
other 
IDA, 
Government 
and 
UNDP 
reports, 
and 
the 
field 
observations 
of 
project 
consultants 
and 
IDA 
Staff. 
Background 
and 
Justification 
of 
the 
IDSMIP 
The 
IDSMIP 
aims 
not 
only 
to 
improve 
local 
livelihoods 
by 
rehabilitating irrigation 
systems 
but 
also 
and 
more importantly, 
to 
build 
the 
social 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
the 
sustainable 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure. 
The transition 
process 
in 
Azerbaijan 
has 
been 
marked 
by 
poor 
attention 
to 
the 
social 
and technical 
infrastructure 
that supports 
agricultural production. 
Because the 
main 
focus 
was 
on 
farm 
enterprises 
rather than communities, 
agricultural 
crop 
production 
received 
greater 
attention than 
the 
ownership 
and 
management 
of 
common 
property, social 
assets 
and 
infrastructure. 
The 
focus 
on 
privatization 
and 
the 
farming 
unit, 
and 
the 
neglect 
of 
infrastructure and 
the 
farming 
community, 
has 
had 
a negative social 
impact 
on 
the 
whole 
rural 
sector. 
The 
collapsing 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
is 
one 
consequence 
of 
the 
transition 
process 
that 
has 
clearly 
negative 
consequences 
for 
local 
development. 
The 
direct 
social objective 
of 
IDSMIP 
would 
be 
to 
improve 
local 
livelihoods 
by 
increasing 
agricultural 
productivity.  Agriculture 
is 
the 
main 
household 
livelihood 
strategy 
and 
the 
main 
determinant 
of 
rural 
income; 
poor 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
limits 
to 
agricultural 
growth. 
The 
Household 
Budget 
Survey 
(2001) 
and the 
UNDP 
Human 
Development Report 
(2002) 
all 
indicate that 
agriculture provides 
a 
critical 
safety 
net 
against 
poverty. 
The 
diagnostic 
study 
undertaken 
for 
this 
project 
established 
that 
agricultural 
income 
in 
cash 
and 
in-kind 
is 
the 
biggest 
source 
of 
income 
for 
all 
wealth 
groups. 
For 
poorer 
households (about 
35 
percent 
of 
the sample) 
agriculture 
was 
essentially 
subsistence 
production, 
while 
many 
of 
the 
wealthier 
households 
derive 
most 
of 
their 
cash 
income 
from 
agricultural 
production. 
Focus groups 
held 
during 
the diagnostic 
study 
established 
that 
the 
conditions 
for 
agriculture 
were 
felt 
to 
be improving; 
a 
conclusion 
confirmed 
by 
Azerbaijan's 
Human 
Development 
Index, 
which 
has 
reported 
growth 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector since 
1998. 
In 
sum, 
the 
IDSMIP 
would 
provide 
critical 
assistance 
to 
a 
sector 
that 
not only 
constitutes 
the 
main 
safety 
net 
against 
poverty 
in 
the 
country, 
but 
also 
offers 
most 
rural 
people 
the 
main 
opportunity 
for 
growth 
and 
investment. 
Indirect 
social benefits that 
could 
be 
expected 
from IDSMIP 
include 
increased 
employment and 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
value 
of 
land.  Increased 
employment 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
strategic 
aims 
of 
the 
State 
Program 
on 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Economic 
Development. 
Both 
employment 
generation 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
value 
of 
land could 
be 
expected 
to 
bring 
benefits 
to 
poorer 
members 
of 
local 
communities 
who currently 
lease 
out 
their land 
and 
may 
not 
have 
sufficient 
capital 
to 
make 
immediate 
use 
of 
improved 
irrigation. 
See 
below 
for 
a 
further 
considerations 
of 
the 
social 
risks 
of 
the 
project 
and 
suggestions 
for 
how 
these 
could 
be mitigated. 
The 
second 
social objective 
of 
the 
IDSMIP 
would 
be 
to 
develop 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
farmer 
managed 
irrigation 
systems. 
This 
would 
involve 
turning 
over the 
authority 
and 
responsibility 
to 
manage 
irrigation 
systems 
from 
government 
agencies 
to 
water 
user 
associations 
(WAS). 
Legislation

and 
institutions 
being 
developed 
under 
IDSMIP 
would 
provide 
the 
framework 
for 
WUAs 
to 
define 
what 
irrigation 
services 
would 
be 
provided and 
the 
authority 
to 
arrange 
the 
provision 
of 
those services. 
This 
process 
would 
involve 
a re-orientation and 
re-definition 
of 
the 
role 
of 
SAIC, 
which 
has 
had 
little 
experience 
in 
taking 
account 
of 
local 
demand. 
It 
would 
also 
involve 
a 
significant 
effort 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
WUAs, 
as 
there 
is 
currently 
little 
experience 
of 
inclusive, 
transparent 
and democratic 
decision-malung. 
The 
little 
experience 
of 
autonomous 
decision-making 
that there 
has 
been 
so 
far 
at 
the 
local level 
has 
tended 
to 
reproduce 
old 
authority 
structures. 
The 
development 
of 
WUAs, 
although 
inevitably 
a 
slow 
process, 
would 
not 
only 
provide 
effective 
irrigation 
management, 
but 
would 
also 
provide 
an 
example 
of 
local 
collective 
action 
and 
negotiation 
between 
different social 
groups. 
This 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
wider 
objective 
of 
building 
sustainable 
local institutional 
and 
governance 
structures 
for rural 
development 
that 
are 
based 
on local 
needs 
and 
priorities. 
International 
experience 
of 
WAS 
suggests 
that 
their 
success 
depends 
heavily 
on 
the extent 
to 
which 
their 
members 
consider 
them 
to 
be 
representative, equitable, 
efficient, 
transparent 
and 
accountable. 
The 
experience 
from 
many 
different 
countries 
has 
led to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
WUAs 
should 
have 
an 
institutional 
framework 
based 
in 
law, 
involve 
a 
separation 
of 
managerial 
and 
executive 
powers, 
establish 
transparent 
financial 
and 
accounting 
procedures 
and 
clearly define 
the 
rights 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
membership. 
This institutional framework 
constitutes 
a 
new way 
of 
doing 
things 
in 
Azerbaijan 
for which 
there 
is 
currently 
no 
local 
capacity. 
This 
would 
involve 
a 
major 
exercise 
in 
training 
on 
technical and 
institutional 
aspects 
of 
WUA 
management 
and 
general 
awareness 
raising 
and capacity 
building 
to 
ensure that members 
understand 
their 
rights 
and 
the 
financial implications 
of 
decisions taken. 
Water 
users, 
in 
particular 
those 
with 
different 
irrigation-related 
priorities 
and 
financial 
capacities, 
are 
likely 
to 
have 
different 
needs. 
Capacity 
building 
work 
must 
therefore 
be 
directed 
at the 
grassroots 
and 
not 
rely 
on 
the 
mediation 
of 
existing 
village 
leadership. 
The 
following 
are 
some 
of 
the 
poverty 
and 
equity 
related 
issues 
that 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
this 
respect. 
Poverty 
and 
Capacity 
to 
Pay 
-- 
Social 
and 
Institutional 
Issues 
In 
most 
of 
the 
WUAs 
included 
in 
the social 
diagnosis, 
people 
reported 
that 
parts 
of 
the 
irrigation 
command 
areas are 
uncultivated 
due 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
adequate 
irrigation 
and 
drainage. 
Owners 
of 
these 
plots 
have 
limited 
opportunities 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
land 
themselves 
or to 
lease 
them. 
These 
vulnerable 
families 
must 
adopt 
diversified 
income generating 
strategies, 
which may 
limit 
their 
ability 
to 
make 
good 
use 
of 
the 
land 
when 
the 
irrigation 
systems are 
rehabilitated. 
Other families 
have 
irrigated 
1ands.but are 
vulnerable 
due 
to 
the inadequate 
and 
unreliable 
irrigation 
service 
they 
receive. 
While 
all 
farmers, 
including 
poor 
ones, 
expressed 
a 
willingness 
to 
pay 
irrigation 
service 
fees 
(ISF) 
in 
principle, 
the 
diagnostic 
study 
suggests 
that 
perhaps 
35 
percent 
of 
all 
water 
users 
might 
have 
problems 
paying 
higher 
fees 
and 
contributing upfront to 
rehabilitation. 
This 
finding 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
economic 
report 
of 
the diagnostic 
studies, 
as 
well 
as 
more broadly 
by 
the 
2001 
Household Budget 
Survey. 
The problem 
is 
not only 
one 
of 
poverty 
but 
also 
of 
cash 
flow; 
even 
middle-income 
farmers 
tend 
to 
have 
few 
sources 
of 
regular 
cash 
income.  However, 
for 
poorer 
households 
the 
increased 
ISF 
may 
entail 
cashing 
in 
on 
capital 
assets 
and 
drawing 
on 
their 
pensions 
and 
social benefits. 
Evidently 
one 
of 
the 
main 
reasons 
for 
low 
agricultural 
incomes 
is 
irrigation 
and 
the 
capacity 
to 
pay 
of 
even 
poor 
farmers 
should 
increase 
during 
the course 
of 
the 
project. 
However 
mechanisms 
for 
farmer 
contributions 
and 
for 
scheduling 
ISF 
payments 
should 
be 
cognizant 
of 
both 
immediate 
and 
longer-term 
constraints 
on 
cash 
flow. 
Further, 
efforts should 
be 
made 
to 
ensure that 
the 
capacities 
of 
the 
poorer 
farmers 
are 
considered 
in 
deciding 
on 
rehabilitation priorities.

Equity 
and 
Local 
Stakeholder Relationships 
-- 
Major 
Challenges 
The 
social 
diagnosis 
was 
not 
able 
reliably to quantify 
the 
distribution 
of 
wealth 
in 
the 
study 
WAS, 
due 
to 
the 
normal 
reluctance 
of 
respondents 
to 
discuss 
their 
source 
and 
size 
of 
income, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
subsistence character 
of 
the 
local 
economy. 
The 
analysis 
of 
household 
budgets 
of 
different 
income 
groups 
revealed a 
significant 
gap 
between income 
groups, however, 
but 
the 
polarization 
of 
income 
is 
somewhat 
cushioned 
by 
the 
fairly 
just 
distribution 
of 
initial 
landholdings 
and 
the 
reciprocity 
arrangements 
between relatives. 
In 
many 
cases, 
this 
has 
meant that 
poor 
families 
unable 
to 
cultivate 
their 
own 
land 
receive a 
small rental 
income 
or 
share 
of 
the 
crop 
others 
cultivate 
on 
their 
lands. 
There 
are 
signs 
that 
these 
relations 
are 
changing and that 
there 
is 
an 
emerging group 
of 
people 
locally 
called 
business farmers, 
who 
are 
distinguished 
by 
their 
relatively 
large 
landholdings 
and 
livestock 
ownership. 
Currently 
some 
of 
these 
farmers 
are 
able 
to 
operate 
successfully 
because 
they 
have 
private 
diesel 
pumps 
to 
ensure 
their 
own 
irrigation 
supply, 
and 
others have 
direct 
water 
contracts 
with 
SAIC. 
In 
most 
instances, the 
success 
of 
these 
farmers 
is 
linked 
to 
and 
reinforced 
by 
opportunities 
in 
local 
leadership structures 
and 
access 
to 
capital 
from 
non-agricultural 
employment that 
was 
invested 
in 
local 
agriculture. 
Similarly, 
under 
conditions 
of 
short 
water 
supply 
and 
poor distribution 
patterns, 
adequate 
water 
supplies 
reflects 
linkages 
to 
local 
leadership. 
The 
project 
would 
most 
likely 
contribute 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
value 
of 
land 
for 
both 
rent 
and 
sale. 
This 
could 
be a 
positive 
development 
for 
poor 
farmers 
while 
they explore other 
livelihood 
strategies 
or 
gather the 
capital 
necessary 
to 
cultivate 
the 
land. 
However 
there 
is 
likely to 
be 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
poorer 
farmers whose 
main 
benefit 
from 
the project, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
early 
phase, 
may 
be 
increased 
rental 
income and 
employment, 
and 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
business 
farmers described. 
The 
latter 
may 
be more 
interested 
in 
cheap 
land 
and labor; 
the 
differences 
in 
priorities 
that 
may 
also 
strain relations 
of 
reciprocity 
between 
extended 
families. 
These 
interests 
may 
be 
further 
divided 
if 
- 
as 
often 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
case 
- 
the 
poorer 
farmers 
also 
own 
land 
at 
the 
tail-end 
of 
the 
system. 
Most 
WUAs 
would 
include 
some 
people 
who 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
irrigation 
fees 
and 
may 
be 
eligible 
for 
exemptions. 
The 
project should 
insist 
that 
exemptions 
from 
payment 
for irrigation 
are 
decided 
by 
the 
WUA 
in 
a 
consultative fashion 
in 
order 
to avoid 
engendering resentment 
and 
conflict. 
The 
description 
above relates 
to 
a 
trend, 
but 
in 
fact 
there 
are 
too many 
variables 
to 
be 
able 
to 
predict quantitatively 
the 
costs and 
benefits 
of 
an 
investment 
in 
irrigation 
for 
different 
groups. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
critical 
for 
the 
process 
of 
restructuring 
WUAs 
be 
used 
as 
an opportunity 
for 
open 
and 
fair 
negotiation 
between 
different 
interest 
groups 
regarding 
operating 
rules, 
exceptions, sanctions 
and other 
common 
issues. 
Kinship 
networks 
have been an 
important 
source 
of 
security 
during 
the 
transition 
period. 
They 
constitute 
an important 
resource 
for 
group 
formation 
because 
they 
are 
characterized 
by 
relative 
trust 
and 
reciprocity. 
By 
their very 
nature, 
however, 
they 
are 
exclusive, 
rather 
than 
inclusive, 
and 
the 
project 
must 
ensure 
that they 
do 
not 
become 
an organizing 
feature 
of 
the 
WUA. 
Information 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
used 
strategically 
by 
those 
in 
leadership positions, 
this 
would 
mean that 
the 
restructuring 
and 
re-registration 
process 
must 
start 
with 
an 
information 
and 
awareness 
raising 
campaign that 
is 
explicitly 
targeted 
to 
reach 
all 
WUA 
members. 
Even 
if 
long-term 
trends 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
may 
result 
in 
the 
consolidation 
of 
land 
ownership and 
agricultural 
production, 
it 
is 
important 
for 
access 
to irrigation not 
be 
allowed 
to 
be 
exploited 
by 
some 
WUA 
members 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
resources. 
Currently, 
it 
is 
clear that 
poorer 
households and 
women 
have 
little 
understanding 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
game 
under 
which 
local 
and national 
institutions, 
including 
SAIC 
and 
WUAs 
operate, whereas 
wealthier 
households 
are 
familiar 
with 
them. 
The 
social objectives 
of 
the 
IDSMIP 
described 
above can 
only 
be 
achieved 
if 
all 
water 
users 
gain 
this 
institutional 
understanding that 
would 
enable 
them 
to 
realize 
full 
value 
from 
WUA 
membership.

In 
some 
communities, refugees (IDPs) also 
constitute 
an 
additional 
challenge 
for 
WUAs. 
IDPs 
do 
not 
receive 
land 
use 
rights, 
but 
they 
lease 
private 
or public 
land, sometimes 
under 
special 
arrangements 
that 
are 
not 
understood 
by 
other 
members 
of 
the 
community, 
and 
work 
as 
laborers. 
Unlike 
other 
members 
of 
the 
communities 
studied, 
IDPs do 
not 
have 
water 
contracts 
with 
SAIC; 
rather, 
their 
water 
fees 
may 
be 
included 
in 
lease 
contracts. 
Whatever 
the 
specific 
circumstances, however, 
the 
social 
diagnosis 
identified 
the 
lack 
of 
integration 
of 
IDPs, 
and 
perceptions that 
they 
receive 
special 
benefits 
not 
available 
to 
other 
members 
of 
the community, especially 
the poor, 
as 
potential 
sources 
of 
conflict 
if 
they 
are 
not 
addressed. 
Representative, accountable 
WUAs 
would 
serve 
as 
an important 
mechanism 
for 
social 
inclusion 
of 
IDPs, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
poor 
households. 
Due to 
the special 
status 
of 
IDPs, 
they 
are 
likely 
to 
be open 
to 
charges 
of 
either 
unjust 
privilege 
or 
discrimination 
by 
other water 
users over such 
issues 
as 
timely 
water 
supply, 
fee 
collection 
and 
sanctions. 
According 
to 
the 2002 
Poverty 
Assessment, 
IDPs 
have a 
higher 
level 
vulnerability 
than other 
social 
groups, 
due 
to 
the 
fact that 
transfers account 
for 
over 
half 
of 
their 
incomes. 
They 
are 
not 
necessarily 
the 
poorest 
members 
of 
communities, 
however.  Experiences 
from 
NGOs 
working 
with 
IDPs 
indicate 
that 
they 
are 
often 
interested 
in 
rehabilitation 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
and 
in 
providing 
labor 
for 
this 
purpose, 
presumably 
because 
the 
land 
they 
have 
been 
allocated 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
the poorest 
quality. 
Nonetheless, 
their 
ability to 
pay 
for 
increased 
water 
fees 
may 
be 
highly 
linked 
to 
subsidy 
levels. 
IDPs 
are 
disadvantaged 
compared 
to 
established residents 
in 
their 
communities along 
a 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
including 
the 
following: 
owning 
the 
land 
they 
cultivate 
(26 
percent, 
compared 
to 
87 
percent); 
having 
irrigated 
land 
(54 
percent, 
compared 
to 
88 
percent); 
complaining 
about 
poor land 
quality 
(48 
percent, 
compared 
to 
30 
percent); 
using 
their 
land 
for cultivation 
(36 
percent, 
compared 
to 
60 
percent); 
owning 
cows 
(27 percent, 
compared 
to 
63 
percent); 
and 
owning 
sheep 
(8 
percent, 
compared 
to 
20 percent). 
The 
role 
and 
rights 
of 
IDPs 
in 
WUAs 
should 
be 
left 
to 
each 
WUA 
to 
decide 
during 
the 
reconstruction 
period 
that 
precedes 
re-registration. 
Given 
the 
uncertain 
status 
and 
land 
rights 
of 
IDPs, 
the 
project 
can 
not 
be 
expected 
to 
prescribe specific 
legislation relating 
to 
IDPs 
or 
issue 
institutional 
instructions 
to 
WUAs. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
presence 
of 
IDPs 
in 
WUA 
areas, 
and 
the 
challenges 
they 
pose 
for 
the successful management 
of 
WUAs 
reinforces the 
importance 
of 
capacity 
building 
during 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
WUA 
development, 
to 
ensure 
that 
their 
plans 
are 
well 
thought 
out 
comprehensive 
and that 
they 
are 
strong 
enough 
to 
be 
able 
to 
address 
different 
local 
priorities 
in 
a 
fair, 
equitable 
and 
transparent 
manner. 
WUAs 
and 
Empowerment 
-- 
An 
Unfinished 
Agenda 
Over 
the 
last 
three 
years, 
SAIC 
management 
recognized the 
potential 
value 
of 
WUAs 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
own 
mandate, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
value 
to 
members. 
More 
recently, 
SAIC 
management 
initiated 
a 
restructuring 
process 
that 
will 
profoundly 
affect 
its 
role 
over 
time. 
First, 
SAIC 
regional 
staff actively 
promoted 
the 
concept 
of 
WUA 
and 
helped 
create 
over 
550 
WUAs 
in 
less 
than 
three 
years. 
This 
was 
followed 
by 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
special 
unit 
in 
SAIC's headquarters 
with 
responsibility 
for 
water 
management and 
revenue 
collection. 
This 
unit 
has 
been 
strengthened 
through 
its 
participation 
in 
project 
preparation 
and 
would 
be 
provided 
further 
support 
as 
it 
assumes 
responsibility 
for 
project 
implementation. 
Most 
recently, 
SAIC 
established 
a 
three-person 
WUA 
Support 
Unit 
in 
each 
regional 
office 
with 
responsibility 
for 
direct 
interface 
with 
WUAs 
under 
the supervision 
of 
the central 
unit. 
The 
project 
would 
train 
(essentially re-train) 
staff 
of 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
and 
provide 
initial 
technical 
support 
to 
establish 
the 
credibility 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
units 
during 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
project 
when 
WUAs 
are 
being 
restructured and registered under 
new 
legislation. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
social 
diagnosis 
provide 
very 
strong 
justification 
for 
these 
major institutional 
changes.

From 
a social 
perspective, 
it 
is 
evident that 
on 
the 
local 
level, 
there 
is 
extreme 
and widespread 
frustration 
with 
the 
deterioration 
of 
irrigation 
infrastructure and 
institutional 
vacuum 
regarding on-farm 
water 
management. 
In 
some 
instances 
water 
is 
paid 
for 
in 
advance 
but 
not 
delivered 
at 
all, 
or only 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
expected 
water 
was 
delivered. 
In 
many 
instances 
people 
do 
not 
cultivate 
their 
land 
at 
all 
because 
they 
can 
not 
be 
sure 
of 
receiving irrigation; 
in 
other 
cases, 
farmers 
invest 
in 
inputs 
and 
lost 
the 
crop 
because 
of 
inadequate water.  Respondents 
in 
the 
social 
diagnosis also expressed 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
amount 
of 
water 
needed 
for 
various 
crops 
and most said that 
they 
relied 
on 
the 
ditch-riders 
to 
regulate 
the 
water per 
crop.  Overall, 
respondents 
were 
unsure 
of 
how 
to 
explain poor 
irrigation 
and 
offered 
explanations that 
range 
from 
SAIC 
incompetence 
to 
dirty 
drains, 
blocked 
collectors and 
illicit 
water 
diversion. 
Few 
people understood 
the 
logic 
of 
either 
the 
new or 
old 
water 
fee 
payment 
system 
or 
the 
regulations 
governing irrigation. 
In 
short, 
the 
limited 
general 
understanding 
of 
both 
technical 
and 
institutional 
aspects 
of 
the 
irrigation 
system 
is 
a 
major contribution 
to 
poor 
management. 
SAIC 
created 
WUAs 
to 
respond 
to 
these 
issues, 
but 
the 
top-down 
approach 
has 
not 
succeeded 
in 
reaching many 
members 
of 
the 
WUAs. 
The 
rules 
and 
rights 
of 
WUA 
membership 
are 
unclear, 
thus 
most 
households 
do 
not 
identify 
themselves 
as 
members. 
The 
stakeholding 
of 
the 
WUA 
in 
irrigation 
should be 
representative 
of 
its 
members, 
but 
this 
relationship 
is 
not 
yet functional. 
Partly, 
this 
is 
due 
to 
technical 
reasons; 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
WUA 
members 
do 
not 
receive 
sufficient 
water 
or 
have decided 
not 
to 
irrigate 
altogether, 
thus 
they 
have 
no 
contracts 
with 
the 
WUA. 
This 
unclear 
relationship 
between 
the 
WUA 
and 
its 
members 
is 
also due 
to 
the 
organizational structure 
of 
the 
WUAs. 
There 
are 
no 
clear 
guidelines 
for 
the management structure 
and 
for 
the 
rights 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
members. 
In 
some 
WUAs, 
households 
form 
groups 
and 
only 
one member 
signs 
a contract 
with 
the 
WUA 
in 
order 
to 
simplify 
the 
process; 
in 
others, 
all 
members 
contract 
individually. 
In 
all 
of 
the 
WUAs 
included 
in 
the 
social 
diagnosis, 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
average 
water 
users have 
no 
clear understanding 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
their 
WUA 
or 
their 
status 
as 
members. 
WUAs 
should 
be 
the 
main 
stakeholders 
in 
irrigation, 
as 
representatives 
of 
water 
users, 
but 
the 
social 
diagnosis 
concluded that 
their 
capacity 
is 
still 
very 
weak 
for 
a 
number 
of 
reasons: 
e 
0 
e 
e 
lack 
of 
technical 
and 
management experience 
in 
irrigation; 
poor irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure, 
which 
not 
only 
makes 
delivery 
difficult 
but 
also 
complicates measurement 
and pricing; 
large 
numbers 
of 
members 
are 
inexperienced 
farmers; 
an 
uncertain 
policy 
and 
legal 
environment 
for 
irrigation, 
particularly 
over 
questions 
of 
rights 
and ownership; 
changes 
in 
the 
system 
of 
payments; 
members 
feel 
that 
vested 
interests 
determine 
the 
supply 
and 
delivery 
of 
water; 
frequent 
conflicts 
over water 
distribution; 
difficulties collecting 
water 
fees 
and 
difficulties imposing 
sanctions 
and 
fines; 
limited local 
understanding 
of 
the 
function 
of 
the 
WUA 
and 
the 
rights 
of 
members; 
and 
limited 
local 
participation 
in 
the operation 
of 
the 
WUA. 
Water 
fees are 
a 
major 
problem. 
Local 
opinions 
vary 
about 
the 
equity 
of 
the 
fixed 
rate 
per 
hectare 
that 
was 
adopted 
in 
June 
2002 
as 
a pragmatic adaptation 
to 
the 
reality 
that 
neither 
WUAs 
nor 
SAIC 
is 
able 
to monitor 
cropping 
patterns 
or 
measure 
actual 
delivery. 
However 
it 
clearly 
does 
not 
provide 
an incentive 
to 
farmers 
to 
economize 
on 
water 
use 
and 
has 
already 
resulted 
in 
conflict.  Under 
this 
system, 
farmers 
receiving 
one 
irrigation 
are 
required 
to 
pay 
the 
same 
amount 
as 
farmers 
receiving 
the 
full 
scheduled amount.  Further, 
although 
it 
is 
meant 
to 
simplify 
delivery 
and 
payment, 
disputes 
over 
both 
persist 
and 
easily 
emerge 
discussions 
with 
groups 
of 
farmers.

In 
four 
out 
of 
the 
six 
WUAs 
included 
in 
the 
social 
diagnosis, 
people mentioned 
that 
there 
had 
been 
conflicts 
over 
water, that 
the 
system 
for 
payments 
was 
unjust 
and that water 
paid for 
had 
not 
been 
delivered. 
Focus 
goup 
discussions 
often 
resulted 
in 
tension between 
members 
and 
WUA 
representatives, 
with 
denials 
and 
accusations 
on 
both 
sides. 
Some 
people mentioned 
that 
the 
position 
of 
the 
WUA 
chairman 
in 
some 
places 
had 
become one 
for which 
there 
was 
an 
unofficial 
price, 
which 
suggests 
that 
significant 
rents 
can 
be 
collected 
from 
this 
position. 
Whatever 
the 
reality 
of 
such 
statements, 
the 
frequency 
and fervor 
of 
such 
claims 
reveals 
a 
significant 
gap 
between 
the 
WUAs 
and 
their 
members. 
Many 
problems 
are 
within 
the 
responsibility 
of 
SAIC, 
beyond 
the current 
control 
of 
WUAs, 
and 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
WUA 
would 
be 
held 
responsible 
for 
irrigation 
related 
problems. 
However 
there 
is 
a 
critical 
need 
to 
build 
the capacity 
of 
WUAs 
and 
to 
ensure 
that the 
main 
stake 
that 
the 
WUA 
has 
in 
irrigation 
is 
the 
efficient 
and equitable operation 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
irrigation 
system. 
Despite 
the 
shortcomings 
of 
WUAs, 
many 
of 
which 
would 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project, 
all 
of 
the 
WUAs 
in 
the social 
diagnosis 
had 
taken 
some measures 
to 
repair 
their 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
infrastructure. 
The 
normal 
course 
of 
action 
has 
been 
to 
collect 
money and 
labor 
from 
households 
along 
a 
section 
of 
damaged 
canal 
to 
hire 
some 
machinery. 
However 
this 
rehabilitation 
is 
usually 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
temporary 
emergency measure and 
focus 
group 
discussions 
pointed 
to 
the 
poor 
infrastructure 
as 
the 
main 
source 
of 
the 
irrigation 
problem. 
It 
is 
clear that 
establishing 
responsibility 
for 
on-farm 
irrigation 
infrastructure 
is 
part 
of 
an 
evolving 
process 
in 
Azerbaijan 
relating to 
the 
range 
of 
basic 
institutional 
infrastructure 
for rural 
development. 
Decisions 
are 
still 
being 
taken 
on 
the 
basic 
structures, 
rights, 
responsibilities 
and 
relationships 
of 
local 
governance. 
WUAs 
are 
therefore 
being 
established 
in 
an environment 
in 
which 
fundamental 
issues 
of 
ownership, 
access 
and 
management 
rights 
over 
local 
resources 
are 
still 
being 
negotiated. 
WUAs 
would 
manage 
and 
collect 
funds 
from 
one 
of 
the 
most 
valuable 
local 
resources 
- 
water 
- 
thus 
they 
would 
inevitably 
come 
under 
pressure 
from 
forces 
-both 
formal 
and 
informal 
- 
that 
attempt 
to 
reduce 
their 
autonomy over 
funds, 
functions and infrastructure. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
WUA 
would 
therefore 
depend 
heavily 
on 
a 
legal 
and 
institutional 
structure 
that 
is 
cognizant 
of 
these 
external 
pressures 
and 
build 
local 
capacity 
to 
maintain downward 
accountability and 
transparency. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
critical 
tasks 
in 
this 
respect 
would 
be 
to 
create 
a clear 
separation 
of 
roles 
between 
the 
local 
self-governing 
institutions 
(belediye) 
and 
WAS. 
The 
diagnostic 
study 
established 
that 
the 
record 
of 
WUAs 
and the 
belediye 
on 
transparency, 
accountability 
and 
inclusive 
decision-making 
is 
currently very 
poor.  Further, 
their 
respective 
roles 
in 
water 
management 
are 
not 
very 
clear. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact that 
WUAs 
are 
not 
very 
strong 
and 
belediye 
have therefore 
become 
involved 
in 
the 
management and 
supply 
of 
water. 
It 
is 
also due 
to 
the 
Law 
of 
the 
Azerbaijan Republic 
On 
the 
Water 
Economy 
of 
Municipalities, 
which 
indicates that 
the 
state 
owned 
water 
structures 
on 
municipality land 
should 
fall 
under 
municipalities, albeit 
that 
should 
only be 
for 
infrastructure 
that 
is 
located 
within 
the 
built-up 
part 
of 
a 
municipality. 
It 
is 
nevertheless 
critical 
for 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
irrigation 
and 
amelioration, 
and 
the 
status 
of 
WUAs, 
that 
is 
currently 
being 
developed 
to clearly 
separate 
the 
roles 
of 
the 
WUA 
and 
the 
belediye 
in 
water 
management. 
It 
is 
equally 
critical, 
however, 
for 
all 
members 
of 
WUAs 
to 
understand 
these 
arrangements, 
which 
again 
argues 
for 
the importance 
of 
information 
campaigns 
and 
training 
programs 
to 
ensure 
that the 
issue 
is 
clearly 
understood 
by 
all 
parties. 
The 
Role 
of 
Women 
The 
privatization 
process 
in 
Azerbaijan 
has 
been especially 
hard 
on 
women 
and 
it 
is 
important 
that 
the 
WUA 
capacity 
building 
process takes 
their 
interests and 
capacities 
into 
account. 
Women 
were 
the 
first 
to 
lose 
their 
jobs 
as 
the 
privatization 
cycle 
first 
targeted 
areas 
in 
which 
women 
were 
traditionally 
employed, such 
as 
services, 
catering 
and 
food 
processing. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
decline 
of 
basic 
social 
-

services 
has 
led 
to 
an 
increasing 
involvement 
of 
women 
in 
substituting 
these 
and a 
decreasing 
number 
of 
women 
taking 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
rural 
privatization 
process 
through 
managing 
agricultural 
production, 
setting 
up 
private 
businesses 
or 
income 
generating 
activities. 
The 
most 
significant 
gender 
issue 
for 
the 
project 
is 
the 
level 
of 
female ignorance 
about the 
economic and 
administrative 
details 
of 
agricultural production. 
It 
is 
important 
for 
women 
to 
be 
made 
aware 
of 
the 
implications 
that 
irrigation 
related works 
and the 
WUA 
would 
have 
for 
the household 
budget. 
It 
is 
also 
important, 
given 
the frequent and 
long 
migrations 
of 
the 
head 
of 
household, 
that 
they 
are 
given 
the 
rights 
to 
vote and 
represent 
household interests 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
household head 
in 
the 
WUA. 
This 
awareness 
raising 
is 
unlikely 
to 
happen 
automatically, 
thus 
information 
campaigns 
should 
consider 
explicitly 
the 
question 
of 
how 
to 
reach women. 
Social 
Cohesion 
and 
Inclusion 
-- 
Important 
Project 
Objectives 
The 
social diagnosis 
highlighted 
a number 
of 
factors that 
influence 
irrigated 
agriculture 
management 
in 
Azerbaijan 
and 
pose challenges 
for 
the 
IDSMIP 
project, 
particularly 
the 
roles and 
activities 
of 
SAIC 
and 
WAS. 
These 
range 
from 
rural 
poverty, 
especially 
poverty 
related 
to 
inequitable 
access 
to 
irrigation 
water and 
poor 
irrigation 
management, 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
vested interests, 
conflict, 
the 
limited 
experience 
and 
skills 
of 
farmers, degraded 
infrastructure 
and the 
essential 
unavailability 
of 
information 
about 
WUAs 
and 
other 
institutions. 
IDSMIP 
can 
not 
be 
expected 
to 
address 
all 
of 
these 
issues 
directly, 
but 
if 
it 
succeeds 
in 
developing 
WUAs 
that 
are 
representative, autonomous, competent, 
equitable, 
efficient, 
transparent and accountable, 
it 
would 
make a 
major contribution 
to 
empowering 
water users 
to 
address 
many 
of 
these 
issues. 
Two 
overall 
social objectives can 
be 
achieved 
through 
this 
effort: 
first, 
to 
promote 
social 
cohesion 
in 
the 
irrigated 
areas, 
enabling 
farmers 
to 
work 
together 
to 
manage 
their 
most 
precious 
resource; 
and 
second, 
social 
inclusion, 
bringing 
all 
WUA 
members 
into 
the 
process 
by 
creating 
a 
level 
playing 
field, emphasizing 
communality 
of 
interests, 
and 
delivering 
results. 
Information 
dissemination 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
elements 
of 
this effort, 
if 
not 
the 
most important 
one. 
The 
diagnostic survey 
has 
revealed a 
communication 
and 
information 
gap 
in 
local 
knowledge 
of 
the 
transition 
process, 
in 
general, 
and 
irrigation 
institutions and 
irrigation 
management, 
in 
particular. 
Local 
practices 
vary greatly 
regarding water 
fees, 
regulations 
on 
credit 
and 
tax, 
administrative 
norms, 
land 
lease 
practices and 
access 
to 
common 
property, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
structure 
and 
operations 
of 
WUAs. 
Some 
of 
this 
variation 
is 
due 
to 
successful 
local 
adaptation. 
In 
many 
instances, however, 
it 
also 
reflects 
govemance 
that 
is 
neither efficient, 
transparent 
nor 
equitable.  Poorer 
households 
and 
women 
have 
little 
understanding 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
game, 
and 
thus 
have 
little 
influence, 
whereas 
wealthier 
households 
do 
have such understanding. 
To 
a 
great extent, 
the 
level 
of 
understanding 
in 
a household 
reflects 
the 
level 
of 
access 
of 
that 
household 
to 
the 
prevailing 
leadership structure, 
and 
thus 
information flows. 
New 
pattems 
of 
information 
dissemination 
must 
be 
established 
to 
overcome 
information 
bottlenecks 
and 
broaden the 
level 
of 
participation 
in 
decision-making 
to 
include 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
interests. 
A 
dedicated communications and 
public 
relations 
strategy 
would 
therefore 
be 
a 
prominent 
element 
of 
initial 
project 
implementation. 
This 
would 
help 
ensure 
that water 
users 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
project 
and 
its 
objectives and that they 
get 
adequate 
information 
to 
understand 
the 
function 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
WAS, 
their 
roles 
and 
rights 
in 
the 
WUA, 
and 
implications 
of 
participation 
in 
the 
project. 
Various 
stakeholders 
would 
be 
consulted 
while 
preparing 
the 
communication and 
information 
dissemination 
program, 
particularly 
water 
users, 
to 
determine 
the 
most 
efficient 
and effective 
ways 
to 
reach 
different 
stakeholders. 
The 
program 
should 
be 
monitored to 
evaluate effectiveness 
and 
adjusted, 
based 
on 
experience. 
Throughout 
the 
project, 
the 
dissemination 
networks 
can 
be 
utilized 
to 
deliver 
-

information 
and advice 
to 
WUAs 
and 
WUA 
members 
on 
topics ranging 
from 
management 
practices 
to 
legislation 
and agricultural 
extension. 
Information 
dissemination 
through 
the 
distribution 
of 
materials 
and 
media 
is 
essential 
for 
restructuring, 
reorienting 
and 
strengthening 
WUAs, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
be 
sufficient. 
Effective 
WUA 
development 
would 
also 
require 
household and 
neighborhood 
contact 
and 
discussions 
with 
WUA 
members. 
SAIC's 
support 
would 
also 
be 
important. 
This 
support 
must 
be 
structured and 
delivered 
in 
new 
ways, 
for which SAIC 
staff 
must 
be trained 
and 
gain 
experience. 
In 
order 
to 
develop 
its 
new 
roles 
as 
water wholesaler 
and technical 
advisor 
to 
WUAs, 
SAIC would 
need 
to 
prepare 
its 
field 
staff 
to 
establish 
a 
new 
field 
presence. 
Currently, 
staff 
of 
the 
SAIC 
regional offices 
communicate 
almost 
exclusively 
with 
the 
small 
management 
team 
of 
a 
WUA. 
In 
developing 
their 
new 
roles, 
staff 
of 
the 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
would 
need 
to 
expand 
their 
information 
and 
communication 
patterns 
markedly 
to 
reach 
all 
WUA 
members. 
They 
would 
be 
provided 
with 
new 
information 
materials that 
are 
designed 
to 
reach 
all 
households 
in 
a 
WUA, 
enabling 
all 
water 
users 
and 
family 
members 
to 
understand the need 
to 
separate 
executive 
authority 
from 
technical 
management 
and 
to 
establish 
mechanisms 
to 
expand 
participation 
and 
increase 
the 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
of 
the 
WUA. 
During 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
project, 
Support 
Unit 
staff 
would 
have resources 
to 
hire 
a 
part-time 
assistant 
in 
each 
WUA 
to 
help 
them 
carry 
out 
this 
information 
campaign 
and 
help 
WUA 
develop 
effective communication 
networks 
that 
reach 
all 
members. 
The 
WUA 
Support 
Units 
would 
also 
coordinate 
training 
of 
WUA 
members 
and 
officials to 
increase 
their 
respective 
competence. 
Most 
critically, staff 
of 
the Support 
Units 
would 
help 
WUAs 
(leaders 
and 
members) develop 
two 
inter-related 
but 
distinct 
agendas: 
first, 
a technical 
agenda 
designed 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and operation 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
and 
improve 
water 
distribution 
and 
management; 
and 
second, 
a 
management 
agenda, 
essentially a social 
agenda, 
that 
establishes 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
WUA 
as 
a 
management 
entity 
with 
responsibility 
to 
deal 
with 
the social 
aspects 
of 
irrigation, 
including 
reporting to 
members, 
mobilizing 
resources, 
articulating 
rights 
and 
responsibilities, establishing 
effective 
appeal mechanisms, 
maintaining 
rules 
and 
regulations, 
and resolving 
disputes. 
This 
would 
also 
entail 
developing specific programs 
to 
address issues 
that 
can 
undermine 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
WUA 
if 
they 
are 
not 
handled 
directly, 
such 
as 
social 
inclusion, 
where 
there 
are 
IDPs or 
new 
water 
users, 
or 
poverty, manifest 
as 
a 
real 
inability 
to 
pay 
minimal 
tariffs.  The 
socia! 
development 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be realized 
if 
these 
two 
agendas, 
developed 
by 
each 
WUA, 
are 
given 
equal 
priority. 
Social 
Impact Monitoring 
The overall 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation framework 
would 
be formulated 
by 
the 
PIU 
M&E 
specialist, 
The 
IDSMIP 
would 
have economic, 
financial, 
institutional, 
engineering, 
environmental and 
social 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
needs 
that 
serve 
different 
purposes. 
The 
purpose 
of 
much 
of 
the 
social 
and 
institutional monitoring 
would 
be 
to 
understand the 
process 
of 
WUA 
formation and 
to 
provide 
WUAs 
and 
project 
management 
with 
early indications 
of 
progress, 
or lack 
thereof, 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
re-orient 
or 
adjust 
the 
process. 
Project 
evaluation 
would 
enable 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
extent 
to which 
interventions 
have 
produced 
the 
intended 
outcomes 
and 
impacts. 
This 
section 
concentrates 
primarily 
on 
issues 
and 
indicators 
related 
to 
social 
impact monitoring, 
which would 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
broader 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
framework. 
International 
experience 
has 
identified 
several 
common 
weaknesses 
of 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
that 
should 
be 
avoided. 
In 
a 
nutshell 
these 
include too 
much 
information; 
results 
that 
aren't 
utilized; 
overly 
standardized formats; 
poor 
baselines 
and 
poor 
sampling 
frames. 
The 
project should 
ensure 
that 
the 
minimum 
information 
needed 
is 
collected 
and therefore that the 
information 
requirements 
of 
the 
project 
are 
well 
thought out.  Social 
impact 
monitoring 
would 
focus 
on 
three 
kinds 
of 
information: 
- 
102 
- 
Page  107

0 
The 
institutional 
characteristics 
of 
WAS, 
including 
whether they 
are 
representative, 
efficient, 
competent, equitable, transparent 
and 
accountable; 
The 
quality 
of 
irrigation 
service and 
the 
impact 
of 
improved 
irrigation 
on 
livelihoods 
and 
incomes, 
overall, and 
on 
different 
social 
groups, 
particularly 
the vulnerable; and 
WUA 
formation 
and management 
in 
meeting 
internal 
objectives. 
The 
first 
two 
types 
of 
information 
are 
closely 
related 
to 
conventional 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
while 
the 
last 
is 
closer 
to 
the 
participatory monitoring 
systems 
that 
are 
increasingly 
used 
in 
farmer 
managed 
irrigation 
projects 
to 
enable 
the 
WUA 
and 
its 
members 
to 
identify 
priorities, 
assess 
progress 
and be 
able 
to 
take 
corrective 
action when 
these 
priorities 
are 
not 
being 
realized. 
A 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation framework 
based 
on local 
needs 
and 
priorities 
can 
only 
be 
developed 
together 
with 
local 
communities. 
If 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
is 
to 
be part 
of 
the 
project, and 
from 
a social 
standpoint 
this 
is 
recommended, 
then 
many 
of 
the 
indicators 
would 
have 
to 
be 
developed 
during 
project 
implementation. 
However 
the 
following 
are some 
of 
the 
possible 
indicators 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
identify 
process 
(in 
particular leading 
up 
to 
re-registration); 
immediate 
outcomes 
and 
ultimate 
impacts. 
These 
are 
presented 
in 
terms 
of 
relevant 
questions 
and related 
indicators. 
Process 
Issues 
and 
Indicators. 
Process 
indicators can be 
collected through participatory 
methods 
that enable 
WUA 
members 
to monitor 
the 
ongoing 
process 
of 
their 
WUA 
formation. 
Some 
process 
indicators 
can 
therefore 
be 
relevant 
mainly 
for 
the 
WUA 
concerned and therefore 
do not 
need 
to 
be 
comparable. 
However 
the 
indicators 
suggested 
below 
can 
all 
be 
aggregated 
and therefore 
be 
used 
by 
project 
management 
to 
monitor 
process. 
In 
particular, most 
of 
the 
indicators 
below 
can 
be 
used 
as 
criteria 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
WUAs 
for 
rehabilitation. 
In 
fact 
linking 
the 
collection 
of 
these 
indicators, 
analysis 
and 
local 
feedback 
to 
re-registration 
and 
rehabilitation 
would 
provide 
a 
time-bound objective 
and relevant 
focus 
for 
monitoring. 
Objective 
Elections 
for 
the 
WUA 
leaders democratic and 
perceived 
to 
represent 
the 
interests 
of 
all 
members. 
WUA 
members 
participate 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the 
WUA. 
Acceptable 
level 
of 
dispute 
and 
conflict 
ovei 
WUA

and

Payment 
of

charges, 
characteristics 
of 
defaulters and 
procedure 
for

Indicator 
Elections 
which 
were 
contested versus 
unanimous; 
WUA 
members 
who 
know 
the 
names 
and responsibilities 
of 
WUA 
leadership; 
WUA 
members 
who 
support 
WUA 
leaders 
and 
their 
policies. 
WUA 
members

Outcome 
Issues 
and 
Indicators. 
Outcome 
issues 
are 
about the 
immediate 
and 
direct 
effects 
of 
the 
project 
and 
the achievement 
of 
key 
objectives. 
Important 
outcome 
objectives 
are: 
(i) 
improved 
efficiency, 
predictability 
and 
adequacy 
of 
irrigation 
supply; 
(ii) 
distribution 
of 
water equitable 
and 
reduced 
conflict 
over water 
supply; 
(iii) 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
system 
improved; and 
(iv) 
water 
fees 
closer 
to 
the 
actual 
cost 
of 
water. 
Many 
of 
these 
would not be 
directly 
related 
to 
the 
broader 
social objectives 
of 
the project, although 
of 
course 
they 
are 
closely 
linked. 
Impact 
Issues 
and Indicators. 
Impact 
issues 
refer 
to 
the 
ultimate, 
indirect 
effects 
of 
the 
project, 
or 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
basic goals 
and 
purposes 
of 
the 
project. 
They 
normally 
take 
longer 
to 
assess 
than 
outcomes 
and 
may 
be 
closer 
to 
evaluation 
than 
monitoring 
although 
the 
process 
of 
gathering 
information 
on 
these 
issues 
should 
start 
early 
on 
in 
the project. 
The 
impact 
of 
irrigation 
on 
social 
welfare 
and 
equity, 
concems 
considered 
earlier 
in 
the 
paper, are 
some 
of 
the 
key 
issues 
that 
should 
be 
monitored. The 
following 
are 
potential 
issues: 
1. 
What 
has 
been 
the 
effect 
of 
WUA 
restructuring 
and 
rehabilitation 
on 
farm 
income and 
economic 
returns 
to 
irrigation? 
a) 
Annual 
cropping 
intensity; 
b) 
Economic 
retum 
to 
irrigated 
land 
= 
gross 
or 
net 
value 
of 
outputfha; 
c) 
Economic 
retum 
to 
irrigation 
= 
gross 
or 
net value 
of 
output 
per 
m3; 
and 
d) 
Seasonal 
or 
annual 
farm 
income 
(gross 
or 
net) 
per 
irrigated 
hectare. 
2. 
What 
has 
been 
the 
effect 
of 
WUA 
restructuring 
and 
rehabilitation 
on 
land 
transactions? 
a) 
What 
are 
the 
leasehold 
arrangements 
and 
costs 
of 
leasing 
belediye 
land; 
b) 
What 
are 
the 
average 
leasehold 
arrangements 
and 
cost 
of 
leasing 
private 
land; 
c) 
Have 
the 
number 
of 
leaseholders increased 
or 
decreased; 
by 
how 
much; 
d) 
What 
is 
the 
average 
size 
of 
plot 
leased; 
e) 
What proportion 
of 
those 
leasing 
land 
are 
from 
inside 
and outside 
the 
village;  and 
f) 
Do 
those 
who 
lease 
land 
out 
stay 
in 
the 
village 
and what 
are 
their 
occupations. 
3. 
What 
has 
been 
the 
effect 
of 
WUA 
restructuring 
and 
rehabilitation 
on 
agricultural 
wages, 
employment 
-

and 
poverty? 
a) 
Annual 
average 
income 
in 
irrigated 
area 
before and 
after; 
b) 
Annual 
person 
days 
of 
labor per ha before 
and 
after; 
and 
c) 
Percentage 
of 
population 
below poverty 
line 
in 
scheme 
before 
and 
after. 
Monitoring 
and evaluation 
procedures 
should 
reflect 
the 
underlying 
objective 
of 
the 
project, 
which 
is 
to 
facilitate 
the 
effective 
transfer 
of 
decision-making 
authority 
to 
WUAs. 
Therefore 
the 
information 
collected should not 
only 
enable 
project 
management 
to 
monitor 
this 
process, 
but 
also 
meet 
the 
information 
needs 
of 
the 
WUAs 
themselves. 
In 
designing 
the 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
it 
is 
therefore 
important to 
consider 
who 
would 
be 
involved 
in 
data 
collection, 
whose needs 
the 
information 
would 
serve, 
and 
how 
the 
data 
would 
be 
used 
and 
presented. 
The 
following 
are 
some 
of 
the social 
issues 
that 
are 
important 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
in 
this 
design: 
As 
indicated, 
the 
PIU 
M&E 
specialist 
would 
oversee 
M&E 
during 
the 
project. 
However 
stakeholders such 
as 
SAIC, 
field 
operations staff, 
WUA 
members, 
WUA 
leaders 
and 
contractors 
should 
be 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
M&E 
process. 
Ideally 
these 
key 
stakeholders 
should be 
involved 
in 
selecting 
or 
approving 
the 
indicators, 
as 
well 
as 
being 
sources 
of 
information 
for 
the 
M&E 
process. 
On 
the 
WUA 
level, 
the 
M&E 
process 
should 
start 
with 
a 
baseline questionnaire 
that includes 
indicators 
relevant 
to 
the 
social objectives 
and 
impacts 
of 
the 
project.  The 
data 
should 
be 
gathered 
by 
WUA 
Organizers 
located 
in 
the 
WUA, 
using 
an 
instrument 
that 
is 
readily 
available 
to 
WUA 
members 
and 
requires 
very 
little 
time to 
complete. 
The 
baseline 
should include 
information 
needed 
for 
future 
M&E, 
including 
the 
following: 
Number 
of 
members 
from 
each 
Village 
within 
the 
WUA; 
Number 
of 
people 
from 
each 
village 
in 
management 
and council; 
Number 
of 
non-members 
of 
the 
WUA 
and 
why 
they 
are 
non-members; 
Number 
of 
potential 
WUA 
members 
who 
receive 
no 
water; 
Number 
of 
women-headed households 
who 
are 
members; 
Number 
of 
members 
receiving 
exemptions 
or 
discounts 
from 
the 
irrigation 
service 
fee; 
Number 
of 
members 
identified 
as 
poor 
by 
the 
belediye; 
Number 
of 
members 
who 
are 
leasing 
land 
out 
land; 
average 
area; 
Number 
of 
members 
who 
are 
leasing 
land; 
average 
area; 
Number 
of 
members 
not 
cultivating; 
Number 
of 
non-residents 
who 
are 
cultivating land 
in 
the 
WUA 
area; 
Number 
of 
absentee 
/ 
migrant 
members; 
Location 
and 
characteristics 
of 
WUA 
members 
not 
paying 
fees 
on 
time; 
Location 
and 
characteristics 
of 
WUA 
members 
not 
paying 
fees; 
and 
Location 
of 
sites 
where there are 
conflicts 
over 
water 
distribution 
or 
unscheduled 
use. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
WUA 
level 
base-line 
that can 
be 
collected 
by 
the 
WUA 
itself, 
a baseline 
should 
be 
taken 
from 
households whose 
land 
is 
located 
in 
different 
parts 
of 
the 
WUA 
service 
area. 
The 
data 
collected 
should 
be kept 
very 
simple and 
focused 
on 
both 
irrigation 
related 
production 
issues 
and 
institutional 
questions. 
A 
promising method 
for 
this 
would 
be 
report-cards, 
whereby 
the households 
would 
monitor 
themselves 
and 
the 
information 
would 
be 
collected, 
reviewed 
and 
tabulated 
biannually, 
analyzed and 
presented 
to 
WUA 
members, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
PIU 
and 
the 
IDA. 
WUA 
Support 
staff 
could 
attend meetings organized 
by 
the 
WUAs 
to 
conduct a 
collective 
assessment 
of 
WUA 
progress. 
The 
purpose 
would 
be 
to 
inform 
both 
WUA 
leadership 
and 
members 
of 
WUA 
progress, 
as 
well 
as 
provide 
the 
project 
with 
an 
indication 
of 
whether 
its 
strategies 
are 
successful 
- 
105- 
Page  110
or could 
use 
some 
modification 
and 
revision.  Social 
impact 
monitoring 
is 
an 
institutionally 
difficult 
task 
and 
is 
often 
resisted, 
thus 
it 
should 
focus 
on 
success 
and 
opportunities 
for 
improvement, rather 
than 
deficiencies,  and 
WUA-level 
assessments 
should be 
discussed 
in 
the 
WUA 
to avoid 
misrepresentation 
of 
results.  Regardless 
of 
the 
difficulty, 
however, social 
impact 
monitoring 
can 
be 
an 
important 
aspect 
of 
the 
project 
and 
should 
take advantage 
of 
the 
substantial progress made 
in 
methodologies that 
involve 
minimal 
external 
intrusion 
and extensive feed-back mechanisms.
