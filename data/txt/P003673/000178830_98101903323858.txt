TAIWAN RAILWqAY ADMINISTRATION
FOURTH RAILW4AY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of the Republic of China has asked the Bank for a
loan of US$15 million to finance the foreign exchange costs of four advisors
to the recently created Transportation Planning Board (TPB) and part of the
foreign exchange costs of the Taiwan Railway Administration's (TRA) interim
1971-1974 Investment Plan.
ii.       The Republic of China has, since April 1965, received three Bank
loans (409-CHA, 524-CHA and 603-CHA) for railway projects totalling US$66.2
million (after cancellations) to help finance acquisition of motive power,
rolling stock and other equipment, and consultant advice and training abroad.
Execution of these projects has been satisfactory as a whole, except for some
difficulties in procurement procedure, now remedied.
iii.      TRA, an agency of the Taiwan Provincial Government (TPG), operates
two unconnected rail systems, a West Line of 715 km and an East Line of 176
km. It continues to be well organized and financially sound, having earned
a rate of return of 6.3% in 1970. Operational efficiency is satisfactory
and the utilization of rolling stock and motive power is good. Maintenance
of railway property is also satisfactory.
iv.       A major transition is occurring in Taiwan's transport sector.  Until
recently, the railway was the most important mode of transport, enjoying a
quasi monopoly in both freight and passenger traffic. During the past two
years, the Government has initiated a number of studies to review the role
of, and balance within, the transport sector to better gear it to the needs
of a rapidly growing economy. In two instances these studies have led to
major decisions: (a) construction has been started on a North-South Freeway
which, when completed, will have significant effect on future rail traffic;
and (b) a central TPB has been created in the National Ministry of Communica-
tion to assess the future role of individual transport agencies, to review
their investment plans and, thus, to direct their growth. Other studies,
specifically the feasibility study of railway electrification which was
financed by the Bank and the Taichung Port at Wuchi, will further affect
the position of the railway.
v.        While the future role of TRA is still uncertain, it is clear that
it will be subjected to increasing highway competition, particularly for pas-
senger traffic. TRA recognizes its vulnerability and is taking measures to
strengthen its competitive position by increasing the flexibility of its
pricing and othier commercial strategies. Given this transitional state, the
Bank's support at this time should be directed primarily toward fostering
activities which have the best chance of ensuring rational reorganization
and growth within the transport sector, i.e., toward strengthening the
nascent planning organization at both national and agency levels by provid-



- ii -
ing advice and funds for technical assistance. A main feature of the pro-
posed loan is this type of assistance. The railway capital investment part
of the Project consists of investments the rationale of which is not funda-
mentally affected by future decisions. The Project is therefore designed
as a "holding operation" to assist TRA in replacing necessary assets and
expanding capacity where demand is sure to exist and to get the Bank in-
volved in the overall transport planning process at this crucial point in
time.
vi.       The proposed loan contains a provision for the financing of 140
man-months of consulting services to assist, over a period of three years,
the TPB in starting its work program. The railway Project consists of two
years, 1972 and 1973, of the 1971-1974 Investment Plan. The proposed loan
would finance the foreign exchange cost of priority items consisting of
freight cars, track materials, signalling equipment, workshops and freight
handling equipment and short period visits abroad by TRA senior staff mem-
bers to study the latest developments in railway techniques and operations.
All purchases would be procured under international competitive bidding,
except for freight handling equipment (5% of the total amount of the loan)
due to standardization considerations.
vii.      The Government will be responsible for servicing US$850,000 of the
proposed loan covering the services of experts to TPB, while TRA will assume
responsibility for the balance. The previous Bank loans (409-CHA, 524-CHA
and 603-CHA) were made to the National Government of the Republic of China,
which owns the railway properties, and it Is intended to follow the same
procedure for the proposed loan. The proceeds for railway purposes, some
US$14,150,000, would be relent to TRA on the same terms and conditions as the
Bank loan to the Government.
viii.     TRA needs to be given more autonomy and flexibility from the Pro-
vincial Government in its administration and operations. Legislative action,
being considered by the National Government, would take some time. As a
step in this direction, the National Government has agreed to carry out a
study, to be completed by June 30, 1972, under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank, analyzing and evaluating TRA's tariff-setting procedures and sal-
ary structure, and to review its recommendations with the Bank.
ix.       TRA lacks the expertise necessary for effective planning and con-
trol in a competitive environment. A planning unit has been set up as re-
quired under the Loan Agreement of Loan 603-CHA, but there is a need for
guidance and instruction in modern methods. This will be supplied by aug-
menting the consultant team selected to carry out the costing and tariff
study being financed under Loan 603-CHA to include staff specialized in
developing planning and control systems.
x.        The Provincial Government has submitted to the Executive Yuan a
proposal to build an 80-km railway, at a total cost of US$61 million, to
link the TRA main line with the East Line. This investment would be the
first stage of a "round the island" railway project designed to foster the
development of Taiwan's east coast. The initial decision to proceed with



- iii -
this "north link" was taken without a detailed economic analysis of altern-
atives. During loan negotiations, it was agreed that action on this proposal
would be taken only (a) after a study of the economic feasibility of a pro-
posed northern transportation link between the eastern and western regions
of the Province, to be undertaken by consultants under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank, had been completed, and its recommendations dis-
cussed with the Bank; and (b) if arrangements were made, satisfactory to
the Bank, for financing t}e construction of such an extension, and its opera-
tion, without imposing any additional financial burden on TRA.
xi.       The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$15 million equiva-
lent. Although the economic life of the assets in the Project is about 20
years, a term of 15 years, including a three-year period of grace, is recom-
mended and TRA is capable of servicing the loan on these terms.

TAIWAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION
FOURTU RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCrION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of China has asked the Bank for
a loan of US$15 million equivalent to finance the foreign exchange costs
of consultant services for the recently created National Transportation Plan-
ning Board (TPB) and part of the foreign exchange costs of the Taiwan Rail-
way Administration's (TRA) interim 1971-1974 Investment Plan.
1.02      The Republic of China received, on April 28, 1965, a first loan
(409-CHA) of US$20 million (reduced to US$17.5 million after cancellations)
to cover TRA's most urgent requirements for motive power, rolling stock and
other equipment during the first four-year period of the then six-year Rail-
way Investment Plan (1965-70). However, traffic increased more rapidly than
expected, necessitating the acquisition of additional equipment to reinforce
TRA's capacity, resulting in two further loans, of US$17.5 million (524-CHA
of January 18, 1966) and of US$31.2 million (603-CHA of May 29, 1969). Pro-
gress in execution of all three projects has been satisfactory. The major
problem has been that of slow procurement due to inadequate and cumbersome
procedures followed by TRA and Government agencies. Most of the difficulties
have now been resolved and improved performance is expected in the future.
1.03      A major transition is occurring in Taiwan's transport sector.
Several large-scale investments including a North-South Freeway, railway
electrification, an East-West link, and a new port at Wuchi are either
under way or being studied. Each of these projects will have an important
influence on the balance within the sector and on the position of TRA. Co-
ordinated planning is critical and must be supplied by the TPB, which cur-
rently lacks the expertise necessary to launch the required work program.
Given this need for assistance, the proposed loan should be perceived pri-
marily as a vehicle for supplying qualified foreign consulting support to
the central planning effort and secondarily as a "holding operation" for
financing TRA investments which are unlikely to be affected by major deci-
sions in the transport sector.
1.04      In keeping with this approach, the railway portion of the project
consists of two years, 1972 and 1973, of TRA's interim 1971-74 Investment
Plan. About US$14 million of the proposed loan would finance the foreign
exchange costs of priority items falling within this period - freight cars,
track materials, signalling equipment, workshop machinery and technical
training.
1.05      This appraisal report is based on the findings of a Bank mission
in November/December 1970, consisting of Messrs. Siret and Mactaggart
(economists), Brechot (engineer) and Chapman (financial analyst), and on
information provided by TRA. It has been edited by Miss V. Foster.



2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Development of Taiwan has been significantly influenced by cli-
matic and topographical conditions. High mountains running the length of
the island in the central and eastern regions occupy about 64% of the area.
Alluvial plains in the west account for another 24%. A third distinguish-
able region is a narrow, fertile valley close to the east coast. Most eco-
nomic and social development has taken place along the western coastal
plain, stretching from Keelung on the north coast to Kaohsiung in the south.
2.02      Population is slightly greater than 14 million.  The population
growth rate has steadily declined from 3.0% in 1963 to 2.3% in 1969, partly
as a result of birth control programs. Density is among the highest in the
world with over 80% of the population living in the western plain. Agri-
culture employs about two-fifths of the labor force with a substantial por-
tion of the remainder being absorbed into the rapidly expanding industrial
sector.
2.03      Gross National Product has been growing at an average of 10% per
annum in real terms over the past five years. In 1969 it reached NT$190
million, representing US$335 on a per capita equivalent basis. A continued
high rate of growth of about 8% per annum is projected for the 1970's and is
considered realistic, providing that investment in transportation and other
infrastructure keeps pace with that of the industrial and service sectors.
B. The Transport Sector
2.04      Administration of transport is extremely complex in Taiwan with
national, provincial, and in some cases, municipal governments sharing re-
sponsibility. Ownership, regulation and planning capabilities vary widely
between modes, leading to problems of omission, duplication and inadequate
coordination. TRA and the deep-water ports are owned by the National Gov-
ernment but subjected to strict provincial jurisdiction in their pricing,
investment planning and budgeting. Maintenance and construction of the
major highways and country roads are the responsibility of the Taiwan High-
way Bureau, a provincial agency which also owns a majority of the bus fleet
and regulates competition among truckers, rates, and vehicle registration.
The new North-South Freeway program is controlled by a national agency,
the North-South Freeway Construction Bureau. Air transport and navigation
are also national concerns.
2.05      Taiwan's major transportation corridor traverses the western plain
which contains all the large cities. This axis is served by TRA's main line,
a two-lane highway and a small amount of coastal shipping. Small private
railways and feeder roads connect these main routes with industrial, agri-
cultural and timber enterprises. The less developed eastern valley is ser-
viced by a shorter TRA line paralleled by an unpaved, single-lane road.
Coastal shipping is small in relative terms, but important in connecting



this region with the rest of the country since no rail link exists and road
connections over the central mountains are poor.
2.06      Rapid economic expansion has generated a sharply increasing demand
for inland transport. Freight and passenger statistics by mode for 1956-
1969 are shown in Tables 1aid 2.  Between 1959 and 1969, freight traffic
grew from 2.2 billion to 3.8  illion ton-km, an average annual increase of
5.0%.  Passenger traffic grew from 8.0 billion to 15.9 billion pass-km, or
at 7.9% per year.  Investment in transport capacity during this period
lagged behind demand, causing congestion at points in both subsectors, par-
ticularly highways, where the rate of growth has been sharpest.  Government
is aware of these problems and has launched a number of preinvestment studies.
The transport sector will remain in a state of transition for the next few
years as new projects are completed, gradually narrowing the gap between
supply and demand.
(i) Road Transport
2.07      Taiwan has approximately 15,500 km of roads, 35% of which are
paved. Most of the network is still in substandard condition. Motorization,
compared to that of other countries in the same per capita income range, is
low, if motorcycles are excluded, amounting to 4.7 vehicles per 1,000 in-
habitants.  Trends in vehicle registration by type are shown in Table 3.
2.08      Great transformation has occurred in this subsector since the
mid 1950's. Industrialization, removal of zonal restrictions on trucking,
establishment of a domestic motor industry and liberalization of vehicle
import restrictions have increased the demand for road services significant-
ly, particularly over short hauls. Between 1960 and 1969, freight traffic
by road more than tripled from 317 million ton-km, representing 13% of the
total, to 1,170 million ton-km, representing 31%. During the same 1960-
1969 period, passenger traffic, excluding urban commuters, doubled from 3.2
billion pass-km, representing 52% of the total, to 6.7 billion pass-km or
56%.
2.09      Road congestion is most acute on specific sections of arterial
highway connecting Kaohsiung and Keelung. A feasibility study, completed
in November 1969, recommended that this link be improved by construction
of a 376-km freeway by 1975. The National Government has decided to pro-
ceed with the two top priority northern sections between Keelung and Yangmei
(70 km) with the aid of financing from the Asin Development Bank and the
Japanese Government. In FY 1972, the Bank intends to appraise the pos-
sibility of financing detailed engineering and construction of the southern
segment between Fengshan and Tainan. The extent to which the freeway will
further alter the modal spli, in favor of highways is still unclear.  Esti-
mates in the island-wide Transportation Economic Study, undertaken during
1969-1970 by the National Government with assistance from the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), suggest that substantial diversion of passenger
traffic would occur by 1980 (para. 3.19). The TPB intends to examine the
issue in more depth during 1971.



-4-
(ii) Rail Transport
2.10      The railway is still the most important transport mode, accounting
for 69% of the ton-km (average haul 170 km), 42% of the long-distance pass-
km and 21% of the local pass-km carried during 1969 (Tables 2 and 4). Its
dominance has lessened steadily as competition from road transport has in-
creased, particularly for freight traffic over short distances. Its posi-
tion is currently endangered by a structure of rates and fares not based
upon relevant economic costs; this will have an increasing impact on rail-
way finances as passenger traffic is diverted to the new freeway. TRA
recognizes this threat and, with the aid of Bank financing, is taking action
to strengthen its pricing, service and planning capabilities. Two important
studies by foreign consultants were financed by Loan 603-CHA: (a) a feas-
ibility study comparing dieselization with electrification for the West
Line completed April 1971 with implementation of the best alternative expected
during the period 1972-1976; and (b) a costing study designed to give TRA the
information necessary for cost-based and commercially sound rate-setting.
The costing study includes development of the framework for an integrated
planning and control system and training of TRA counterpart staff to use it
effectively; it should be completed, and an outline of the basic system es-
tablished, by the end of 1972. TRA, under an agreement with the Federal
Republic of Germany, has employed consultants for a six-month period starting
January 1971 to examine ways in which containerization and palletization
could improve operations. Finally, TRA is making progress in strengthening
its commercial policy. Faced with a decline in freight traffic in mid-1967,
management corrected the trend by launching an aggressive marketing campaign
to (a) increase pricing incentives to important customers by offering con-
tract rates which reduce as the percentage of their total output carried by
the railway increases, (b) improve customer service by streamlining pickup
and delivery, expanding domestic container services and purchasing special-
ized rolling stock for bulk cargo and (c) capture traffic by building private
sidings and leasing land along rail lines for new plant construction.
2.11      The Provincial Government has submitted to the Executive Yuan 1/
a proposal to build an 80-km rail line to link the TRA main line, presently
terminating at Suao in the northeastern part of the island, to the East Line
at Hualien. This investment would be the first stage of a "round the island"
railway project designed to develop Taiwan's east coast. Capital costs are
estimated at US$48 million in addition to the US$13 million which TRA would
have to spend to widen the East Line to meter gauge. Annual operating losses
on the new line are forecast at US$3-4 million and would be absorbed by the
Provincial Government. The initial decision to proceed with this "north
link" was taken without any detailed economic analysis of alternatives. Dur-
ing loan negotiations, it was agreed that action on this proposal would be
taken only (a) after a study of the economic feasibility of a proposed north-
ern transportation link between the eastern and western regions of the Prov-
ince, to be undertaken by consultants under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank, had been completed, and its recommendations discussed with the
1/   Administrative branch of the Government.



- 5 -
Bank; and (b) if arrangements were made, satisfactory to the Bank, for finan-
cing the construction of such an extension, and its operation, without im-
posing any additional financial burden on TRA.
(iii) Aviation
2.12      China has two privately owned air carriers, China Air Lines which
operates on both international and domestic routes, and Far Eastern Trans-
port, which operates domestically. Taipei is the terminus for all inter-
national traffic. In mid-1970, a feasibility and preliminary design study
was started to look into the possibility of relocating the Taipei airport at
Taoyuan, some 21 miles away along the proposed North-South Freeway.
(iv) Ports and Shipping
2.13      Taiwan's two major ports at Keelung and Kaohsiung are being expand-
ed to handle traffic which has doubled in the last five years. The need for
further investment to accommodate growing traffic in containers has been rec-
ognized by the National Government. A study exploring the feasibility of a
new port at Wuchi, concluded during 1970, recommended that construction begin
in 1972 with the first phase completed by 1974. The UNDP Transport Economic
Study, in contrast, found that a mid-island port would not be needed until
1978 at the earliest. The Government and the Bank are currently reviewing
both studies. The Wuchi port, if constructed, would have a major impact on
the pattern of import-export traffic, reducing the average distance hauled.
Some additional diversion of freight traffic from rail to road would un-
doubtedly occur.
C. Transport Coordination
2.14      Lack of adequate planning in the transport sector has been a prob-
lem since the early 1960's. As a result of the first Bank Loan, 409-CHA, a
Committee for Coordination of Transport composed of the heads of transport
agencies was established and attached to the National Government's overall
planning commission, the Council for International Economic Cooperation and
Development (CIECD). While its terms of reference included establishing
long-term transportation development plans, most of the work actually under-
taken was short term in nature, conducted largely on an intramodal, project
by project basis. This mechanism was recognized as seriously deficient by
the UNDP Transport Economic Study undertaken during 1969/1970. In response
to its strong recommendation to strengthen coordinated transport planning,
the National Government, in August 1970, established the TPB, chaired by the
Minister of Communications. The Board is composed of 22 members representing
national, provincial and municipal levels of government and the private sec-
tor, and is assisted by a secretariat including 20 professionals. Annex 1
shows its major functional relationships with individual transport agencies
and other government bodies.
2.15      The TPB is an advisory body responsible for recommending programs
aimed at providing an adequate transportation system at least cost. Terms
of reference and a tentative three-year work program for it have been pre-



- 6 -
pared by the National Government in consultation with the Bank and are at-
tached as Annex 2. Two broad categories of functions have been assigned:
(a) recurrent functions such as research, preparation of aggregate invest-
ment plans, coordination of planning among transport agencies, review of
individual investment budgets and evaluation of organization and regulation
in the transport sector and (b) non-recurrent functions such as a study of
the modal split between TRA and the freeway in the western corridor, a study
of highway user charges and development of an overall model of the transport
system.
2.16      TPB lacks qualified manpower.  The proposed loan includes finance
for 140 man-months of foreign consulting service over a three-year period.
The advisory team would initially be composed of at least three members - a
senior economist, a project economist, and a transport planning engineer -
with additional experts provided from time to time as required. The National
Government would service this part of the loan. To ensure a high quality,
coordinated assistance effort with adequate backup, these experts will be
recruited from a consulting firm. The Government is now in the process of
soliciting proposals; the firm, and individuals to be assigned, together with
their detailed terms of reference, will be agreed with the Bank.
3. THE TAIWAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION
A. Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      TRA, for operating purposes, is an agency of the Provincial Gov-
ernment. The Ministry of Communications of the National Government also has
authority over TRA and, as a result of this dual responsibility, some Gov-
ernment control procedures, particularly regarding tariffs and wages, are
unduly complex and time consuming. In the present context of increasing
road competition, it appears necessary that TRA be given more flexibility
in its administration and operations. Consideration is being given to
legislative action enabling a change in TRA's status; this would require
some time and the Bank has suggested that changes designed to streamline
present procedures (particularly with respect to tariff changes and pay
scales) should be made at an early date. During loan negotiations, it was
agreed that (a) the National Government will cause a study to be completed
June 30, 1972, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, covering
an analysis and evaluation of TRA's tariff-setting procedures and salary
structure and (b) the recommendations of this study will be reviewed with
the Bank.
3.02      Management, operation, administration and services are generally
satisfactory and well organized. Staff is competent and industrious, and
labor relations are satisfactory. However, since it is important that
senior staff be well informed of the latest developments in railway tech-
niques and operations, provision has been made in the proposed loan for
financing short-period visits abroad of TRA senior staff members to study
specific problems. One aspect requiring attention relates to overall plan-



- 7 -
ning and control in which TRA presently lacks expertise. Although a planning
unit has been set up recently, as required under Loan 603-CHA, there is a
need for guidance and instruction in modern methods. This is being supplied
by augmenting the consultant team selected to carry out the costing and
tariff study being financed under Loan 603-CHA to include staff specialized
in this field.
B. Property
(i) Track
3.03      TRA consists of two unconnected systems:  (a) the West Line (1.067
m gauge), with 408 km of main line (222 km of which are double track) and
397 km of branch lines (including 8 km of double track); and (b) the single
track East Line (0.762 m. gauge), which is only 176 km long. Terrain pre-
sents some difficulties on both lines. There are 1,667 bridges with a total
length of 42,140 m and 69 tunnels totalling 19,820 m.
3.04      Both West and East Lines are well maintained.  The West Line stan-
dard of construction, with mostly 37 kg/m rails, gravel ballast, wooden
sleepers and dog-spikes, is adequate at present. However, with increasing
traffic density and greater train and car weights, an improvement to 50 kg/m
rail, concrete sleepers and welding of rails is being carried out by TRA.
The permanent way of the East Line, equipped with 30 kg/m rail, is being re--
ballasted to allow for an increase in maximum axle load from 8 to 10 tons
after full dieselization.
3.05      The signalling system is being continuously improved to increase
line capacity. A substantial part of the West Line is operated with the auto-
matic block system, and centralized traffic control (CTC) covers 411 route-km.
Fifty-two stations and yards are equipped with relay, electric or electro-
mechanical interlocking plants. Lines with lighter traffic have the electric
token block system. Two hundred and ninety-four highway level crossings on
the West Line and seven on the East Line are now provided with automatic gate
or alarm systems.
(ii) Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.06      TRA's motive power and rolling stock as of October 31, 1970 are
shown in Table 5 and summarized below:

- 8 -
3.07      Most of TRA's steam locomotives are old, more than 40% being over
40 years. TRA has advanced a considerable way toward full dieselization by
adding 12 diesel locomotives on the East Line in 1968 and 44 locomotives on
the West Line in 1969 and 1970. However, the Government, for economic and
policy reasons (indigenous electric power, security, foreign exchange, etc.),
decided to study the possibilities of main West Line electrification. In
view of the considerable expected increase in traffic beyond the present
level of 100 trains a day and of the forecast high traffic density on this
line, there is a case for electrification or full dieselization. While the
present number of diesel locomotives would not exceed the needs for branch
lines and shunting operations, an early decision on electrification or full
dieselization is required to permit planning of future investments. Provi-
sion was made in Loan 603-CHA for financing a feasibility study of the elec-
trification of the main line of the west system and the final report has
recently been issued. The National Government and the agencies concerned,
TRA and the Bank will review the study and the recommendations made by the
consultants; this procedure is likely to be lengthy because the study has to
be reviewed in the general context of the transport scheme in the western
corridor of Taiwan, based itself on other studies such as those of the North-
South Freeway and the Wuchi port. No final decision on electrification may,
therefore, be expected before 1972.
(iii) Other Properties
3.08      Six marshalling yards serve West Line traffic.  The largest, Hua-
Shan yard in the suburb of Taipei, will be replaced by the new Chi-tu fully
mechanized marshalling yard being built with Bank financing (Loan 409-CHA);
construction was delayed because of land acquisition difficulties, difficult
terrain and adverse climatic conditions, but is now expected to be completed
by the end of 1971.
3.09      TRA's buildings, stations, workshops and sheds are well maintained.
With increasing rolling stock and diesel locomotives, the main workshops at
Taipei and Kaohsiung need extension and modernization; this is included in
the present project.
C.   Manpower, Productivity and Wages
3.10      Details of TRA's labor force, productivity in terms of train-km
and traffic units and labor costs are given for 1963 to 1969 in Table 6.
Over this period the average labor force has remained at about 27,000 em-
ployees, and with increasing traffic, productivity has improved. The number
of employees per 1,000 train-km has been reduced from 1.00 in 1963 to 0.83
in 1969 and the traffic units (pass-km + ton-km) per employee have increased
during the same period by 54% from 245,000 to 379,000; the trend of these
ratios is good.
3.11      Average pay per employee has increased in the same period by about
102%, but is equivalent only to US$75 per month, which is low compared to
salaries paid for equivalent positions in the private sector; in 1969, total
staff costs accounted for 44% of total operating costs, which is low. TRA's



- 9 -
salaries and wages, and particularly those of the more senior technical and
supervisory staff, were raised during 1969. This brought the salaries of
such staff more in line with those working for entities directly under the
National Government; however, further increases would appear to be necessary
to attract adequate qualified personnel. Pensions were also improved in
1969 with consequent increase in cost to TRA.
D.   Operations
3.12      Tables 7 and 8 present a summary of railway operating statistics
for the West and East Lines over the last ten years; these show improving
efficiency in most of the important indices. Diesel engine-km per engine-
day in service have decreased due to the assignment of new locomotives to
shorter runs previously performed by steam, and average turn-around time of
freight cars has increased slightly, although it is still satisfactory. The
average load of freight cars has increased due to improved design of new
rolling stock. Punctuality is good. Complete elimination of steam power,
either by electrification or full dieselization of the main line, will im-
prove operations still further.
E.   Tariffs
(i) Passenger Fares and Freight Rates
3.13      Procedures for changing rates and fares are cumbersome.  Over the
last ten years, there have been only two tariff revisions, in 1961 and 1967.
3.14      The tariff structure, summarized in Annex 3, has existed largely in
the same form as in 1961, except for an expansion of the existing five freight
commodities to eight (designed to increase revenue from certain classes of low
rated traffic, particularly coal), carried out in 1967.  Although undertakings
were given under both Loans 409-CHA and 524-CHA to introduce tariffs based on _
costs, TRA, due to lack of experienced staff, has not been able to introduce
a system of traffic costing required as the base for a modern tariff system.
However, very rough average unit costs indicate that (a) present freight rates
are too low and freight traffic does not cover costs and (b) passenger fares
are too high, making this traffic very vulnerable to competition as the high-
ways are improved. To meet this situation, TRA is engaging consultants,
under Loan 603-CHA, to assist in introducing modern traffic costing tech-
niques and establishing a tariff structure reasonably related to costs,
which will ensure an adequate financial return.
(ii) Social Privilege Rates and Fares
3.15      Social privilege fares, imposed by government, presently apply to
school children and students, government employees and military personnel,
while reduced freight rates apply solely to military traffic (Annex 3).
Considerable traffic is carried at these reduced rates and fares, and TRA
estinates that on the assumption that traffic would not be reduced by higher
prices, the total revenue lost in 1969 was about NT$ 320 million. Although,
as required by previous Bank loans, action has been taken over recent years



- 10 -
to remove discounts on certain freight commodities and to increase the pas-
senger base fare for commuters, government has been reluctant to move against
the military discounts which TRA estimates account for about NT$ 180 million
of the revenue loss. Regarding commuters, accounting for the other roughlv
NT$ 140 million of the revenue loss, government realizes that rail transport
is the most economic solution and therefore wishes to keep fares low to keep
this traffic off the roads.
3.16      These privilege rates and fares are probably below the relevant
marginal costs of TRA, a fact that can be determined only after TRA's cost-
ing system is installed. During negotiations it was agreed that, within 24
months after the date of the Loan Agreement, (a) a cost accounting system
will be established and (b) all tariffs for TRA's services will be raised
at least to the relevant marginal cost level, unless a case can be made for
a subsidy through the railway pricing system, in which case the difference
between the tariffs collected and the marginal cost would be reimbursed to
TRA by the government.
F.  Traffic
(i)  Traffic 1961-1969
3.17      Passenger Traffic:  In 1969, short-distance traffic accounted for
about 3.2 billion pass-km, of which 27% was commuter traffic (Tables 2 and
4). Long-distance traffic accounted for about 2.6 billion pass-km but only
13% of the number of passengers. About 96% of all TRA pass-km are travelled
on the West Line. Long-distance, short-distance (non-commuter) and commuter
traffic on the West Line grew at about 15.7%, 3.5% and 5.4% a year, respec-
tively, from 1961 to 1969.
3.18      Freight Traffic:  Freight traffic has been growing at about 2.9%
per year over the past eight years, rising from 2.0 billion ton-km in 1961 to
2.4 billion ton-km in 1969 (Table 1). The average length of haul has re-
mained fairly constant during the same period, equalling 174 km on the West
Line and 80 km on the East Line in 1969. About 98% of TRA's freight traffic
is carried on the West Line. Coal is the largest single commodity, account-
ing for 24% of the total traffic, followed by cement (10%), grains (8%),
military supplies (8%) and fertilizer (5%). Over 90% of freight traffic con-
sists of commodities which are bulky in relation to value, making them rela-
tively unattractive to road transport, particularly over longer hauls.
(ii) Traffic Forecasts 1971-1974
3.19      Traffic forecasts for TRA have been made on a regular basis since
1963. Forecasting is undertaken on two levels. The Ministry of Communica-
tions prepares forecasts for each mode of transport based upon trends in
agricultural and industrial production, population, foreign trade and nation-
al income. TRA forecasts aggregate rail traffic by essentially the same
method over a 10-year time horizon. It then makes more detailed forecasts
by major commodities for a four-year period based upon market information.
TRA forecasts covering the duration of the Investment Plan 1971-1974 are



extremely detailed and acceptable (Tables 4 and 9). Beyond this point some
modification in trends will take place in response to completion of addi-
tional sections of the Freeway and the Wuchi port, if constructed. The
UNDP Transport Study concluded that, by 1980, no diversion of freight traf-
fic to roads would occur, given the bulk nature of the commodities carried
by rail and the imposition of highway tolls. As much as 40% of projected
passenger traffic, however, including a substantial segment of the full-
fare long-distance passenger group, would use the Freeway. While the exact
amount of diversion cannot be estimated at this time, it would reduce income
generated by the West Line (para. 6.08).
3.20      Passenger Traffic:  Passenger traffic forecasts for both lines
are given in Table 4. Long-distance traffic is expected to grow at the
rate of 9% per year to 1974, which is reasonable, given the absence of high-
way alternatives and current consumer preferences for rail travel.
3.21      Freight Traffic:  Forecasts for freight traffic are presented in
Table 9. Coal will remain the chief commodity carried although at a lower
level as the better seams are depleted and more users switch to oil. Cement
transport is expected to show the greatest increase, about 13% per year,
reflecting expansion of capacity to meet demands of the rapidly growing
construction industry. Moderate increases are anticipated in transport of
fertilizer and of salt and oil to fulfill growing industrial demand. On
the East Line, the most significant increase is projected for timber due
to expansion of logging operations and the opening of a new mill at Hualien.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   The 1971-1974 Investment Plan
4.01      In view of the major decisions to be made by the government in the
transport sector - the timing of the construction of the North-South Freeway,
electrification of TRA operations, construction of an East-West link and a
new port at Wuchi - TRA, in consultation with the Bank, has prepared a Capital
Investment Plan for the period 1971-1974 which is summarized below. It should
be regarded as an "interim" plan as it includes only items, works and services
unlikely to be affected by key future decisions. During negotiations, agree-
ment was reached on the size and scope of the Plan, and that there would be
no substantial changes in the Plan without the agreement of the Bank.

million.  Table 10 presents a detailed breakdown of the elements in the Plan
by year. Itemized cost estimates include price contingencies, about 10%,
and, on certain works, a 5% physical contingency. The major part of the
Plan consists of motive power and rolling stock (27%), track material and
equipment (26%), construction and equipment of marshalling yards and improve-
ments to station yards (8.5%) and workshop equipment (15%).
B.   The Project and the Proposed Loan

4.04      The total cost of the Project is estimated at about NT$ 1,674 mil-
lion (US$41.8 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$21.5
million. The major elements within the Project are track materials and
equipment (36%), workshops equipment and freight handling equipment (14%),
motive power and rolling stock (242) and construction and equipment for
marshalling yards and improvements to station yards (5%).  The main item
under "Technical Services" i8 the financing of consultant services to the
TPB, requiring about US$0.9 million from the proposed loan.
4.05      Estimates of the foreign exchange components of the Project are
based on the most recent quotations obtained under international competitive
bidding for similar items. No physical contingencies are considered neces-
sary for the type of equipment to be procured under the proposed loan.
Price contingencies of about 10% have been added to allow for a possible in-
crease in the price of steel and other materials. Local costs, which include
port charges and fees, duties, assembly costs, track work costs, and erection
costs of signalling and level crossing warning equipment are based on actual
expenditures for similar works performed under previous Bank loans; a price
contingency of about 10% has also been added to allow for possible wage in-
creases (para. 3.11) with a physical contingency of about 5% on the local
costs of items 4, 6 and 7 above. Both foreign and local estimates are real-
istic.



- 14 -
4.06      The proposed Bank loan would cover US$15 million (70%) of the
US$21.5 million estimated foreign exchange costs of the Project (Tables 10
and 11). A further US$2.7 million will come from existing Bank loans. The
entire foreign exchange costs are not being financed, mainly because the dif-
ferences represent small investments spread throughout the system which are
unsuitable for Bank financing. The remaining US$3.8 million will be provided
from China's foreign exchange resources in exchange for local currency pro-
vided by TRA. The US$20.3 million equivalent in local currency costs will
come from TRA's own resources.
4.07      About 54% of the proposed loan would be used to finance materials
for strengthening 281 km of main line track between Keelung and Changhua.
An additional 9% would be slated for purchase of 160 freight cars for spe-
cialized traffic on the East and West Lines. With the balance of the loan,
several smaller investments will be procured: warning devices for 80 level
crossings, a relay interlocking system for Tainan station, freight handling
equipment, and equipment for the Taipei and Kaohsiung workshops. Provision
has also been made for financing the foreign costs of 140 man-months of con-
sulting service for the TPB. A complete description of Bank financed items
is given in Annex 4.
C.   Execution of the Project, Disbursements and Procurement
4.08      TRA is competent to carry out the Project, which is expected to start
by mid-1971 and to be completed by mid-1974. Disbursements will be made on
the basis of CIF costs of imported equipment and the foreign costs of con-
sulting services and overseas training. An estimated schedule of disburse-
ments and the basis on which this schedule has been built up are given in
Annex 5.
4.09      All items to be financed out of the proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan will be procured through international competitive bidding, in accord-
ance with the procedures of the Bank, except for the freight handling equip-
ment, which for standardization purposes will be procured from a specific
supplier; similar equipment was procured under the previous Bank loan (603-
CHA) after international competitive bidding and it is appropriate for TRA to
negotiate the purchase of these items directly with the present suppliers,
especially since the number of units to be procured is small relative to those
now on hand. The foreign exchange involved is estimated at US$800,000 or
about 5% of the total amount of the loan.
4.10      The cost estimates are based on recent quotations obtained for simi-
lar goods under international competitive bidding. If any savings in foreign
expenditure result from favorable prices in competitive bidding, the corres-
ponding savings in the loan account would be used to finance the foreign ex-
change cost of additional but similar Project items subject to review and
agreement with the Bank.
4.11      Foreign exchange cost of the Project assumes that all rolling stock
and motive power will be procured from foreign firms; this will be true for
diesel locomotives and is likely to be the case for rolling stock since the



- 15 -
two Chinese firms equipped for such manufacturing are currently working at
full capacity. Should these Chinese firms enter and win the bids for the
rolling stock, however, it is recommended that US$2.34 million be disbursed
against the orders as if they were won by foreign firms. In such a case, a
maximum of about US$600,000 in local currency costs would be covered in the
proposed loan.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The Project has four basic objectives:  (a) to assist the TPB in
conducting its ambitious work program; (b) to replace important railway in-
frastructure as part of an ongoing process of modernization; (c) to provide
modest expansion of railway capacity where demand has been clearly estab-
lished and (d) to improve railway management and operating abilities. A
detailed economic evaluation of the physical items is presented in Annex 6.
5.02      Four investments are primarily for replacement and represent con-
tinuation of modernization programs started under earlier Bank loans. A
further 281 km of track between Keelung and Changhua on the West Line will
be strengthened to permit the higher train speeds and axle loads which are
economic and will become commonplace after implementation of the electrifi-
cation or dieselization program. Seventy-five passenger cars will be rehab-
ilitated with new steel bogies to meet growing demand for passenger ser-
vices. Automatic warning devices will be installed at 80 new locations to
improve safety and reduce labor costs. The manually operated interlocking
plant at Tainan station will be replaced by a new automatic system.
5.03      Other investments will provide a modest expansion of capacity where
demand is assured. The present Kaohsiung workshop and depot, which cannot
handle growing repair and storage requirements, will be replaced by new facil-
ities built in suburban locations. New equipment will be purchased for the
Taipei and Kaohsiung workshops to speed up and improve the servicing of loco-
motives and rolling stock. Several types of freight handling equipment will
be acquired to improve TRA's inland freight handling operations and assist its
development of an international container service.
5.04      The economic rates of return developed in Annex 6 on quantifiable
items accounting for 60% of the project are listed below:
Rate of Return
(a)  Track strengthening                                   18
(b) New motive power and rolling stock
for East and West Lines                               20
(c)  Worksnop equipment                                    12
(d)  Freight handling equipment                            25
(e)  Automatic warning devices                             15
(f)  Relay interlocking system                             12

The major sources of benefit are from savings in operating and capital costs
and from increased utilization of productive equipment. The remaining 40%
of the Project is made up of over 60 small, unrelated investments on which
no quantification of attributable benefits has been attempted. These in-
vestments appear to have sound justification based on common sense and good
technical criteria. All benefits have been conservatively estimated and
show the quantifiable portion of the Project to be well justified. The
economic rates of return range between 12 and 25%.
5.05      The Project is well conceived at this time.  Its components will
make important contributions to the railways' ongoing operations yet are in-
dependent of longer term development in passenger traffic and the major de-
cisions to be made in the future regarding electrification or dieselization
of the West Line and competing highway investments.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Present Position
6.01      Over recent years the earning power of TRA has been good, and has
steadily improved, while its financial position has been satisfactory. Reve-
nue earning capacity is highly dependent on passenger traffic which generated
63% of total revenue in 1969, making the financial viability of TRA vulnerable
to highway competition (para. 6.08).
6.02      Operating results 1/ for the years 1965 to 1970 are given in Table
12 and summarized below:
1965    1966    1967    1968    1969        1970
(NT$ million)
Operating revenues         1,512   1,653   1,868   2,168   2,363        2,616
Working expenses           1,065   1,130   1,310   1,434   1,568        1,802
Depreciation                 199      198     220      232     262        299
Total operating expenses  1,264   1,328   1,530   1,666   1,830         2,101
Net operating revenue        248      325     338      502     533        515
Interest charges              67       70      88      103     119        173
Net income                   190      241     241      336     424        340
1/   The figures quoted are for both the West and East Lines.  The East Line
operates at a loss; in 1969 the loss was NT$ 7 million with an operating
ratio of 107.



- 17 -
6.03      The operating, times interest earned, and debt service coverage
ratios all improved over the 1965-1969 period, from 84 to 77, 3.8 to 4.6 and
2.7 to 2.8, respectively. TRA undertook, as required by previous loans, to
earn a rate of return of no less than 5.5% by 1969, and 6% by 1970 (Loans 409
and 524-CHA); under Loan 603-CHA, the required return was raised to 6.5% in
1970 and to 7% in 1971 and thereafter. TRA has exceeded these targets, except
in 1970, when 6.3% was earned (and the other financial ratios similarly de-
clined slightly), the slight reduction being largely due to the increase in
wages in 1969 and to the considerable increase in the value of land, follow-
ing a revaluation in 1967 (para. 6.13).
6.04      Although labor costs rose by 73% over this period, they are still
quite low, representing about 44% of total operating costs. The average labor
cost per traffic unit, with better efficiency, increased by only 14%, from
NT$ 0.194 to NT$ 0.221. Other costs have also risen - i.e., the Taipei
wholesale price index rose by 9% over the period. Assisted by tariff in-
creases and by introducing more high-speed, comfortable and higher rated
long-distance passenger services, the average revenue per traffic unit rose,
over the period, by 25%, from NT$ 0.226 to NT$ 0.283.
6.05      Depreciation is charged on all assets except land, road-bed con-
struction, tunnels and tracks, and takes into account periodic revaluation of
assets (para. 6.13). The increases in depreciation charged in 1969 and 1970
reflect the effect of increased investment, together with some reductions in
asset lives. The charge in 1970 was about 5.5% of the value of depreciable
assets and 11.5% of gross operating revenues, which is reasonable.- TRA pays
no income tax, but currently makes an annual contribution to the Provincial
Government of NT$ 50 million.
6.06      The balance sheets for 1966-70 are given in Table 13 and summarized
below:
1966     1967      1968     1969          1970
(NT$ million)
Assets
Net current assets              571       794       800      745           683
Net fixed assets              5,893    6,077    7,846    8,012           9,177
Funds, advances and
investments                   420       446      556    1,182            987
Other assets                    233       206       218      340           423
Totals                   7,117    7,523    9,420   10,279         11,270
Liabilities and Equity
Debt                          1,444    1,554    1,665    2,124           2,807
Other liabilities                 17        4         6        7            11
Equity                        5,656    5,965    7,749    8,147           8,452
Totals                   7,117    7,523    9,420   10,278         11,270
Finances, as reflected by these balance sheets, have been satisfactory:
over the last three years the current ratio has varied between 2.3 and 1.9,
the liquid ratio between 0.9 and 1.2 and the debt/equity ratio was 25/75 in



- 18 -
1970. Actual cash balances, varying between NT$ 9 million and NT$ 50 mil-
lion, are low compared with average monthly cash operating expenditures of
about NT$ 130 million. Large cash balances have not been necessary, however,
as TRA is a member of the TPG "Pool Fund", a source of credit similar to a
running overdraft, which can be drawn on as required by certain provincial
agencies.
6.07      The requirements and provision of cash over the years 1966-1970
are given in Table 14. Foreign exchange requirements of investment have
come largely from the three Bank loans, and TRA's own generation of cash
has been sufficient to service all debt, make annual payments of between
NT$ 60 and NT$ 72 million to the TPG, improve its working capital position,
and make substantial contributions to investment. Borrowing from TPG "Pool"
funds has helped finance local costs of investment; other borrowings are
largely to finance construction of spurs to electric power plants.
B.   Future Prospects
6.08      TRA has prepared forecasts of future earnings and finances for the
years 1971-1974. Summary pro forma income statements, balance sheets
and statements of cash flow are presented on the following page in tabular
form. Tables 12, 13 and 14 present the same information in more detail.
The general picture over this period is one of increasing earnings, substantial
generation of cash, and a satisfactory financial status. Beyond this period,
as discussed in paragraph 3.19, competition from the proposed Freeway may
make considerable inroads into TRA's higher-rated passenger traffic. Should
as much as 40% of this traffic be lost by 1980, TRA's annual net operating
revenues may then be reduced by NT$ 500-600 million. This would still
leave sufficient funds to service debt, but would reduce TRA's capacity
for financing the local currency cost of further investment. Such investment
would, of course, depend on the overall future traffic prospects of TRA,
which would have to be reviewed in the light of developments on both highways
and ports. The projections of revenues, cash requirements and borrowings,
particularly in 1973 and 1974, should be regarded as interim forecasts,
subject to revision when a decision is made regarding electrification or full
dieselization of TRA's main line.
Ci) Earnings
6.09      The revenue estimates are based on the railway's traffic forecasts
(para. 3.19). The expenditure estimates, which take into account the re-
quirements of increased traffic and the economies of improved efficiency,
are based on 1970 prices.
6.10      The summary of estimated earnings makes no allowance for tariff
adjustments, as may be necessary in the light of any future increase in
price levels, or as determined by the costing study about to commence.

- 20 -
6.11      Operating ratios are expected to improve slightly from 80 in 1970
to 76 in 1974; with interest requirements rising from NT$ 173 million in
1970 to NT$ 231 million in 1972, and falling to NT$ 201 million in 1974, the
times interest earned ratio will improve from 3.0 in 1970 to 4.0 in 1974.
Net income after interest should rise from NT$ 340 million in 1970 to NT$
608 million in 1974. The rate of return is expected to improve from 6.3%
in 1970 to 7.5% in 1974. This performance is satisfactory.
(ii) Finances
6.12      Substantial net internal cash generation, NT$ 4,597 million, after
covering debt service, contributions to Government and some improvement to
working capital amounting to NT$ 2,663 million, will provide NT$ 1,934
million toward total capital investment requirements of NT$ 3,425 million.
The balance, NT$ 1,491 million, would have to be met by borrowing. Of
this sum, NT$ 1,356 million would be provided by the existing and proposed
Bank loans: of the remainder, NT$ 14 million would come from a local
bank to finance employees' housing, NT$ 16 million would be provided by
cement companies to finance hopper cars and TRA is likely to approach
the Bank for the balance of NT$ 105 million, as part of further lending
which may become necessary to finance electrification or complete dieseliza-
tion. Debt service includes full repayment of the "Pool" borrowing as
agreed by TRA, and this was confirmed during negotiations.
6.13      Equity includes surpluses arising from asset revaluations.  The
last revaluation, covering all fixed assets other than land, was carried
out in 1961, followed in 1967 by a special revaluation of land. TRA in-
tends to do a further revaluation in the near future in accordance with gov-
ernment regulations related to the movement of the wholesale price index in
Taiwan.
6.14      TRA's debt, assuming that the proposed loan will be for a term of
15 years including a three-year grace period, is forecast to grow from
NT$ 2,807 million as of the end of 1970, to NT$ 3,554 million in 1972, fall-
ing to NT$ 2,810 million by the end of the period; debt-equity ratios will
improve from 28/72 in 1972 to 21/79 in 1974, which is quite favorable. Debt
service coverage varying between 1.6 and 2.3 over the period is acceptable.
Current and liquid positions varying between 2.0 and 2.3 and between 0.9 and
1.0, respectively, are also acceptable.
(iii) Budgets, Accounting and Auditing
6.15      TRA prepares annual operating and capital investment budgets which
must be approved by both the Provincial and National Governments.
6.16      TRA's accounting and internal auditing procedures are generally
satisfactory. The matters of costing and financial control have been dis-
cussed in paragraphs 3.02 and 3.14. External auditing is done by staff of
the Provincial Ministry of Audit and the procedures have been satisfactory,
As provided for by Loan 603-CIIA, detailed annual audit reports are transmitted
to the Bank within seven months after the close of TRA's fiscal year.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of
the Republic of China on the following principal items:
(a) any action regarding the construction of the proposed railway
"north link" will be postponed until an economic analysis of
alternatives is undertaken and the conclusions are discussed
with the Bank (para. 2.11);
(b) the Government will cause a study to be undertaken covering
an analysis and evaluation of TRA's tariff-setting procedures
and salary structure, and will discuss its recommendations
with the Bank (para. 3.01);
(c) social privilege rates and fares will be adjusted or compen-
satory action taken by Government after installation of TRA's
costing system (para. 3.16);
(d) the scope and size of the 1971-1974 Capital Investment Plan
as agreed upon during negotiations will not be altered sub-
stantially without further agreement with the Bank (para.
4.01).
7.02      The Project, which is technically sound and of economic benefit
to the country, would be a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$15 million
equiivalent to the Republic of China. Although the economic life of the
assets in the Project is about 20 years, a term of 15 years, including a
three-year period of grace, is recommended and TRA is capable of servicing
the loan on these terms. The National Government would be responsible for
servicing US$850,000 of the proposed loan covering the services of experts
to the TPB. The proceeds of the loan for railway purposes only (about
US$14.1 million) would be made available by the National Government to
TRA on the same terms and conditions as those granted to the National
Government by the Bank.

NOTES
TABLE 13
CHINA
TAIWAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION
Notes on TRA's Balance Sheet
December 31, 1970
1.        "Funds Advances and Investments" includes:
(a) NT$ 451 million payments financed from Loans 524 and 603-CHA
for goods shipped in 1970 but not received by end of the year
plus
(b) NT$ 318 million of TRA expenditure with respect to the above
equipment; and
(c) NT$ 197 million as the value of assets used in TRA's auxi-
liary enterprises (hotels and catering service, hospital, etc.).
2.        "Fixed Assets" -- Value based on revaluation of all assets other
than land, carried out in 1961, with a revaluation of land in 1967/68, plus
cost price of assets acquired since. Revaluation is governed by the move-
ment of the wholesale price index in Taipei.  By December 31, 1969, it
had increased by about 18% since 1961, and a further revaluation will be
done when the increase reaches 25%.
3.        "Capital"  includes surpluses resulting from revaluations of
assets carried out in 1952 and 1961, totalling about NT$ 4.1 billion.
4.        Apparent discrepancies in reconciling figures between Tables 12
and 13, in years 1966-1970 (mainly affecting Fixed Assets, Depreciation
and Earned Surplus) arise from year-end adjustments due to (a) retirements
of assets and (b) corrections to previous year's accounts.

ANNEX 2

CHINA
TAIWAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION
Terms of Reference for Transportation Planning Board and
Tentative Work Program 1971 to 1974
A.   Transportation Planning Board - Terms of Reference
The Transportation Planning Board (TPB) came into being on
August 1, 1970, as a government agency established under the Ministry of
Communications. The TPB was created to improve the state of transportation
planning in Taiwan; it will both originate planning and review the planning
of other agencies. The TPB is an advisory body, rather than an executive
body, and, on all matters with which it deals, will be expected to make
recommendations to the Minister of Communications.
The overall function of the TPB is to recommend measures that
need to be taken and investments that need to be made in order that Taiwan,
at all times and in every respect, be provided with an adequate transpor-
tation system at the least possible cost. More specifically, the functions
of the TPB are seen as follows:
1.   Promote and coordinate transportation planning at all
levels of goverment;
2.   Collect and compile transportation data and economic
information required for comprehensive transportation
planning;
3.   Conduct research concerning the relationships between
transportation and social, economic and political
factors;
4.   Conduct research to determine the financial and
economic costs (including incremental costs) of all
transportation, and to establish the relationships of
transport service charges to these costs;
5.   Determine current and future transport demand by region
(including major urban areas) and by mode;
6.   Establish a system for the continual review of the
adequacy of the transportation network to meet current
and future demand and to originate proposals for
investments or operational changes whenever existing
facilities would be deemed inadequate;



ANNEX 2
Page 2
7.   Review the evaluations of proposed investments or
changes in policy, charges, operations, or organization
presented by other government transportation agencies;
8.   Conduct studies, or participate in the conduct of studies,
to evaluate proposed investments or changes in policy or
charges, whenever a proposal would involve more than one
transportation agency, or whenever the planning office of
an agency charged with conducting a study would require
assistance;
9.   Recommend a schedule of investment priorities, developed
on the bases of economic, social, andlor financial returns,
among the various proposals for new investment;
10.   Examine, in concert with other agencies, the advisability
of non-transportation solutions (that is, solutions which
would reduce transport demand rather than expand or improve
the facilities for meeting demand) to transportation
problems;
11.   Develop short-term and long-term investment programs for
the transportation sector, and review such programs
annually; and
12.   Review government policy regarding transportation, and
recommend revisions, including revisions in laws, rules,
and regulations, when advantageous.
In terms of transportation facilities, the scope of the TPB's
concern includes all of Taiwan's seaports, existing and planned, the
Provincial Railway System, all airports other than those used exclusively
by the military, and all highways, including inter-xurban highways and
rural roads. The TPB sphere of concern would not extend to the railways
owned and operated by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the Taiwan Forestry
Bureau, except as such railways would influence the traffic demand for
other transportation facilities.
In political terms, the sphere of concern includes the Taiwan
Railway Administration, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau, the Keelung Harbor
Bureau, the Hualien Harbor Bureau, the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA), the Taiwan Highway Bureau, the road department of the Provincial
Public Works Bureau, the Taiwan Area Freeway Construction Bureau (TAFCB),
the Taichung Harbor Construction Bureau, and the Taipei City Bureau of
Public Works. In addition, whenever a Taichung Harbor Bureau and a freeway
bureau will have been established to operate these planned facilities,
and whenever other agencies would be formed to construct and/or to operate
other facilities, then the TPB would also be concerned with their policies
and plans.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
The TPB will, in concert with other agencies, make detailed fore-
casts of demand for transportation facilities and services. It will also
determine the capacities of all existing facilities, and of all facilities
for which construction has been approved by the government. In this way,
the TPB should be aware of capacity problems which might arise in the
transport sector. When such problems are foreseen, the TPB may, itself,
propose possible solutions which might be considered, or it might forewarn
the concerned agencies of the problems to be faced. In the event that, once
apprised of up-coming problems in meeting transport demand, no proposals
would be forthcoming from the concerned agencies, the TPB might then originate
proposals itself, or might recommend to the Minister of Communications that
the concerned transportation agencies be directed to develop proposals.
Once a proposal for investment, or change in policy, charges, or
whatever, would be made either by the TPB or by another concerned trans-
portation agency, the concerned agency would be required to develop a study
plan, unless two or more concerned agencies other than the TPB would be
involved, in which case the TPB might itself develop a study plan or might
recommend that another government body conduct a study.
In the event that more than one concerned transportation agency,
other than the TPB, would be affected by a given problem, the TPB may not
only develop the study plan, but also conduct the study in concert with the
concerned agencies.
In those instances where a problem would involve only one other
transportation agency, the procedure for arriving at a final decision would
generally take the following steps:
(1) Recognition of problem by TPB or concerned agency;
(2) TPB and/or concerned agency proposals for solution;
(3) Development of study plan by concerned agency;
(4) Review of plan objectives, methodology, schedule, and
manpower requirements by the TPB;
(5) TPB and concerned agency agreement on demand forecasts;
(6) Conduct of study by concerned agency;
(7) Submittal of study to TPB for review; and
(8) If study approved by TPB, recommendation on proposal made
to the Minister of Communications.
If the study would recommend that one or another proposal be
implemented, and the TPB would approve the study, and the Ministry would
approve TPB's recommendation based on the study, then the Ministry would
issue a directive to the concerned agency to develop a proposal for im-
plementation. After the implementation, proposals would be developed either
by the concerned agency alone or, in concert with the TPB, the latter agency
would recommend the implementation plan to the Ministry. Once the plan was
approved by the Ministry and other concerned government bodies, if any,
the concerned agency would be responsible for adhering to the approved
schedule for implementation.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
In those cases when the TPB would have conducted, either alone or
in concert with other agencies, the original feasibility study, and would
have made a recommendation to the Minister of Communications on the basis
of that study, the Ministry would still, upon giving its approval of a
project, issue a directive to a concerned transportation agency to develop
a proposal for implementation, and the concerned agency would, after
approval of the proposed implementation plan, report periodically to the
TPB on the progress being made on implementation.
If at any time the TPB would deem the planning capabilities of
any of the transportation agencies with which it is, or will be, concerned,
to be inadequate, it is empowered by the Ministry to conduct a study of
the needs of said agency in this regard, and would thereafter make recom-
mendation to the Ministry for improving the planning capability of the
agency.
B.   Tentative Work Program:  1971 - 1974
The work items of the Transportation Planning Board might broadly
be classified into two groupings: (1) reviewing the evaluation and fact-
finding studies, implementation plans and schedules, investment and annual
capital budgets developed by other transportation agencies; and (2) conduct-
ing evaluation or fact-finding studies, and participating in the develop-
ment of implementation proposals and investment schedules.
The number of work items and the scheduling of TPB reviewing
efforts for the former grouping are highly uncertain since the capabilities
of the planning departments of the various transportation agencies, to meet
the more stringent planning standards to which they must hereafter adhere,
have not yet been fully tested. Moreover, in some instances, the inclina-
tions of the agencies are known only broadly, and, thus, even if effective
planning efforts could be presumed, the number of work items to be presented
by each agency to the TPB over the 1971-1973 period could only be roughly
guessed at.
Nevertheless, the approximate dates for TPB review of some of
these items are known, and would include the following (the agencies
responsible for the various items, and the approximate dates for TPB review
are indicated in parentheses): Railway electrification study (TRA - third
quarter, 1971): Railway Fifth IBRD Loan Application (TRA - first half,
1972): Freeway toll study (TAFCB - third quarter, 1971); Freeway southern
section World Bank loan application (TAFCB - second half, 1972); new inter-
national airport study (CAA - first quarter, 1971); new airport loan
application (CAA - 1972); Taichung Harbor loan application (Taichung Harbor
Construction Bureau - 1971); and Taipei City urban transportation study
(Taipei City Government - first half, 1972).
Other proposals which are likely to be evaluated by transportation
agencies other than the TPB over 1971-1973, but for which the dates for TPB
review are less certain, would include: Railway Sixth IBRD Loan Application
(TRA); Freeway Yangmei-lisinchu section Asian Development Bank loan request



ANNEX 2
Page 5
(TAFCB); Highway 1 widening and other improvement (TUB); expansion of
container facilities and moving of log basin at Keelung Harbor (Keelung
Harbor Bureau).
There are likely to be other proposals evaluated by the various
transportation agencies and submitted to the TPB for review; certainly
there should be other highway projects to be considered over 1971-1973.
In addition to all of the proposal evaluations submitted to the
TPB, the other transportation agencies will also submit implementation
schemes for government-approved proposals, and longer-term investment
programs; the major items included in any of the investment budgets or
programs should all have previously been reviewed by the TPB and approved
by the government.
If any of the proposal evaluations or any of the other items to
be submitted to the TPB are not deemed adequate, the TPB will either: (1)
return the item submitted for its review to the submitting agency with
a detailed explanation of its apparent failings; or (2) work with the
submitting agency to improve the work item. In case there would be many
instances where items being submitted by a single agency would not appear
adequate when reviewed, the TPB might have to involve itself in the develop-
ment of the planning capability of said agency.
The scheduling of the TPB work effort involving the second major
grouping of work items, viz., the evaluation studies and the fact-finding
studies which the TPB would conduct, itself, can be done with somewhat
greater precision. As of the end of 1970, the TPB was engaged in conduct-
ing five studies; these are listed and discussed below.
(1) A Macro Transportation Model. This study would make demand
forecasts for each transportation mode. It would attempt to determine
total transportation costs for each mode, and the potential cost savings
which might be realized with improved facilities. It would then seek to
find the levels of investment which would be required to realize the cost
savings, and the foreign exchange components of such investment totals.
The preliminary report of this study is expected to be completed in 1971.
(2)  Data Collection and Forecasting of Transport Demand by
Traffic Zone. The Transportation Economic Study (TES), completed in
November 1970, divided the Island of Taiwan into 23 "traffic zones"; it
then determined base year interzonal traffic volumes, and, on the basis of
economic forecasts and correlations with transport demand, projected inter-
zonal traffic volumes and patterns to 1980. Because of the considerable
size of a traffic zone, however, and the disregard for the patterns of
intrazonal traffic, it was not possible to pinpoint the needs for roads or
for fixed railway facilities.
Accordingly, the TPB has determined to increase the number of
traffic zones on the Island of Taiwan from the total of 23 used in the
TES, to a total of 309, all of which would have boundaries which coincided



ANNEX 2
Page  6
with those of the 309 townships on the Island. The islands of Penghu Hsien
and other near-sea islands would comprise still other traffic zones.
For each of the traffic zones, the TPB would compile economic and
demographic information including production value by commodity; production,
export, and import tonnages by commodity, population; zonal gross products,
income, and per capita income; planned new investments; and land-use by
various urban and rural classifications. Economic and population growth
would be projected for every zone, and on the basis of these forecasts and
the established relationships of such growth to vehicle registrations and
transport demand, forecasts of these latter items would be made.
A map of each traffic zone would be drawn showing the locations
of all fixed transportation facilities of any importance (including private
railway sidings), and the locations of all cities, towns, villages, and
sizable industrial plants. Accompanying data sheets would give information
on the capacities of each facility, on the condition and level of service
of all facilities, and on the traffic counts (divided between intrazonal
and interzonal traffic volumes, and periodically updated) on each facility.
The work on both the macro transportation model and on the traffic
zones was initiated in order that the TPB might eventually become the
"authoritative" source of transport demand projections. To achieve this,
the TPB must necessarily establish strong liaisons with a multiplicity of
agencies which would act as data sources, furnishing pertinent data on
a regular basis, without requiring the TPB to request such information
each time. On the basis of such information, the TPB would periodically
revise all its demand forecasts (and would revise its regional demand
forecasts for the area which would be affected whenever it would be apprised
of a new major investment). With this procedure for projecting demand and
capacity analyses for all existing transportation facilities and publicly-
owned equipment, the TPB should be able to pinpoint problems of congestion
and/or high costs of maintenance or operation several years in advance,
and forewarn the concerned transportation agencies of the impending
problems and the advisability of considering new investment.
(3) A Study of Highway User Charges. The purpose of this study
is to compare the total revenue from highway user charges with the future
financing resources to be made available for highways from present tax
sources and future tolls, and to compare each of these with the projected
highway financing needs. Because the future toll revenues from vehicle
operation on the freeway should comprise a significant portion of total
user charges, however, completion of this study must await the completion
of the planned freeway toll study; the toll study is expected to be com-
pleted by July 1971, and the highway user charge study is scheduled for
completion in November 1971.
(4) A Study of Manpower Needs for Planning, Design and Con-
struction in The Transportation Sector. The objective of this study is
to determine to what extent manpower needs in the transportation sector



ANNEX 2
Page 7
might prove to be a restraining influence in the development of effective
planning departments for every agency, and in the designing and construction
of approved projects. The study would estimate the year-by-year (1971 to
1980) manpower needs of each agency in the transportation sector for plan-
ning, design, and construction. These totals would then be compared to
the present totals of available manpower to determine the additional man-
power needs during the decade. The scheduled completion date for this
study is December 1971.
(5) A Highway Freight Movement Survey. This is a resumption of a
survey conducted by the Overall Planning Division of the CIECD; the TPB
is to be involved in the survey for only one year, after which it would
become entirely the responsibility of the Taiwan Highway Bureau. The
results of the survey would not only be useful for highway planning, but
the additional knowledge of origin and destination of exports and imports
would be helpful in determining a construction schedule to be recommended
for the planned Taichung Port. The survey report is expected to be
completed by March 1972.
Another study which is to get under way during 1971 is a West
Coast modal split analysis based on incremental costs. The modal split
analysis is a study that the IBRD has suggested be made prior to consider-
ation of construction of the central sections of the freeway. The study
would attempt to determine the optimum splits of freight and passenger
traffic between the West Line Railway and Highways in Taiwan's Western
corridor. Four situations would be examined, viz., (1) without freeway
or electrified railway; (2) with entire freeway but without electrified
railway; (3) with electrified railway but without central (from Hsinchu
to Tainan) freeway sections; and (4) with completed freeway and electrified
railway. The Taichung Port would be assumed to be constructed according
to the Government-approved schedule for each case. This study is not
expected to begin until around June 1971, and would require about one year
for completion.

List of Goods to be Financed by the Proposed Loan
1.        The total foreign exchange cost of the Project is estimated at
US$19.2 million of which US$15 million or about 78%, consisting of priority
items suitable for Bank lending, would be financed by the proposed loan.
These items are described in detail in the following paragraphs.
Track Strengthening: Keelung to Changhua
2.        Strengthening of track over 281 km of the main trunk line between
Keelung and Changhua (341 km) is necessary to permit the higher train speeds
and axle loads resulting from full dieselization or electrification. This
project is part of a continuing program of track strengthening of which 60
km from Taipei to Hsinchu is being implemented under the Third Bank Loan
(603-CHA). The project includes improvement of track curvature in six
locations, widening of road bed over 137 km, relaying of track with 50 kg/m
rail, elastic fastening, concrete and/or wooden sleepers over 281 km, welding
of rails over 67 km, and replacement of 262 sets of turnouts and switches.
Rolling Stock for East and West Lines
3.        Rolling stock includes one hundred and thirty 35-ton covered
hopper cars for the West Line to meet demand for bulk grain transport and
30 freight cars for the East Line (25 gondola and five covered box cars)
for the transport of logs and pulp to and from a new mill at Hualien. The
estimated foreign exchange cost component of these wagons assumes that
foreign firms will win the bids. If, however, the bids are won by Chinese
firms, it is recommended that US$2.34 million be disbursed against the
orders as if they were won by foreign firms. This would mean that a maximum
of about US$600,000 of local currency costs would be covered in the proposed
loan.
Workshop Equipment - Taipei and Kaohsiung
4.        Taipei workshops are equipped with a high percentage of over-aged
and inefficient machine tools; the power plant is over 35 years of age and
breakdowns occur frequently. New equipment for the diesel motive power shop,
the car shop and the power plant will speed up and improve the repair to
diesel locomotives, railcars, and passenger coaches, the number of which has
been constantly increasing during the past years. Kaohsiung workshop is
being expanded to cope with freight car repair and maintenance requirements.
Machine tools are being procured under Loan 603-CHA; the proposed new loan
provides for the procurement of the larger equipment requirements of the
workshops, a number of overhead cranes and an air compressor.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Freight Handling Equipment
5.        Freight handling equipment consists of a 40-ton crane, three
tractors and nine trailers, six 10-ton fork lifts and 25 heavy-duty trucks.
This equipment will improve inland freight handling operations and assist
in developing an international container transportation service.
Automatic Warning Devices
6.        Automatic level crossing warning equipment is intended to assure
greater safety of train operation; 80 level crossings will be equipped as
continuation of an on-going program for which funds were provided in Loan
524-CHA.
Relay Interlocking System - Tainan Station
7.        The manually operated interlocking plant at Tainan, an important
station on the trunk line, has been in service for more than 25 years. Not
only has its capacity become insufficient to cope with the increasing number
of trains, but spare parts for maintenance are difficult to procure. The
proposed relay interlocking system will reduce manpower, save train operation
cost and insure better safety. This project is part of an on-going program
of modernization of interlocking plants in the nine main stations of the
West Line; equipment for two of these stations, Patu and Kaohsiung, were
financed by Loan 603-CHA.
Other Investments Proposed by TRA and Subsequently Deferred or Deleted
From the List of Goods
8.        In addition to the items to be financed under the proposed Loan
and described above, TRA had also included three major items, namely 10
diesel electric locomotives, improvement to the telecommunication system
on the trunk line and an automatic train control system; cost estimates for
these items totalled about US$6 million. After discussions between the
Bank and TRA, it was finally agreed that (a) the diesel locomotives were
not required for TRA's operations before 1973 and that the matter would be
reconsidered when a decision is taken regarding full dieselization or
electrification; (b) TEA does not require at present a new telecommunication
system using coaxial underground cable; if necessary, additional lines may
be rented from the Post and Telephone (P&T) Department at a much lower cost;
however, the use of underground coaxial cables would be necessary should
single-phase electrification be adopted and the matter will be reconsidered
at that time; and (c) automatic train control system, though ensuring
increased safety of operation, was not fully justified because of the already
high standard of safety attained by TRA.

NOTE:
The establishment of this tentative schedule of disbursements has been
based on the following information and facts:
(a)  The timetable prepared by TRA detailing the anticipated
successive stages of procurement of the items financed
under the proposed loan (approval of specifications by the
Bank, bidding period, evaluation of bids and awarding,
establishment of the letter of credit, manufacturing period,
delivery, construction or installation period); this time-
table, based on TRA's experience for similar items procured
under previous Bank loans, appears realistic;
(b) TRA's usual procedure of making disbursements upon shipping
and not in successive payments as is generally the practice.
To take account, however, of possible shipping difficulties,
disbursements in respect to heavy or bulky equipment have
been distributed over two quarters (75% of the total dis-
bursement in the first quarter in which the shipment
begins to take place and 25% in the following one); and
(c) Contingencies incorporated in the figures of cumulative
disbursements at the end of each quarter.

Economic Evaluation and Methodology
Track Strengthening
1.        As part of a continuing project started under Loan 603-CHA, the
Project calls for strengthening of track over 281 km of the main trunk line
between Keelung and Changhua. This improvement is necessary to permit the
higher train speeds and axle loads which are more economic and will become
commonplace after implementation of the dieselization or electrification
program. The investment of US$13,477,400 provides for the improvement of
alignment, widening of roadbed and strengthening of track by upgrading rails,
sleepers and ballast. Several benefits will result. Maintenance and
replacement costs will be reduced considerably through use of heavy rail
welded in 1-km sections, together with concrete sleepers, and replacing
river stone ballast by crushed stone ballast. Running of trains will be
improved by higher train speeds resulting in time savings for crews and
equipment. Reductions in curvature will reduce train operating costs by
minimizing the need to slow down and then accelerate with correspondingly
heavy fuel consumption. These benefits yield an internal economic return
of 18%. A further saving, the time savings of passengers, is important
but not included in the above analysis. If this benefit is added, the rate
of return is increased to 21%.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock for East and West Lines
2.        The Project calls for the purchase of cabooses, specialized
freight cars and a small number of locomotives to meet anticipated increases
in freight traffic up to 1973. Even at current traffic levels there is a
shortage of cars at certain times during the year, particularly during the
sugar season. One hundred and thirty 135-ton hopper cars, costing
US$2,453,600, will be used to meet the rapidly expanding demand for trans-
port of bulk grains on the West Line; 25 gondola and five box cars, costing
US$318,000, will assist in serving a new mill at Hualien by hauling logs
and pulp on the East Line. In additon, 40 caboose cars at US$575,000 will
be used to replace over-age equipment on the West Line and four diesel
locomotives at US$620,000 will provide the modest expansion of capacity
necessary on the East Line.
If this investment were not made, traffic would be diverted to
trucking at substantially higher cost. Analysis based upon a comparison of
island-wide average costs of rail and road transport suggests that retaining
traffic on the railway would generate an annual net saving of US$2,000,000



ANNEX 6
Page 2
initially, falling to about US$1,100,000 after completion of the North-
South Freeway. The reliability of the cost estimates (US$0.00667/ton-km for
rail transport and US$0.02285/ton-km for road transport) developed by the
Freeway appraisal study team as approximations of relevant economic costs is
suspect, however. These estimates were therefore subjected to a sensitivity
analysis which halved the differential of US$0.0162/ton-km between them to
a more reasonable US$0.0081/ton-km. Taking the total investment in motive
power and rolling stock as a package, the internal economic return is
extremely satisfactory, approximating 41% when the original cost estimates
are used and 20% when subjected to sensitivity analysis.
Kaohsiung Workshop and Depot
3.        At Kaohsiung, the present workshop and depot is operating at
capacity and cannot be expanded to service the growing wagon requirements
because of space limitations. Both are therefore being moved: the depot
to the new southern marshalling yard and the workshop to a suburban
location. About US$2,500,000 equivalent is included in the Project for the
removal of the old shop and inspection sheds. The information required to
calculate an economic rate of return on the aggregate investment is unavail-
able. The expenditure is fully justified, however, on technical grounds.
Funds for building the new workshop will come from the sale of the land on
which the present workshop is situated. The cost of constructing the new
depot is included in the estimate for the southern marshalling yard.
Workshop E uipment
4.        In order to meet continually increasing requirements for main-
tenance and repair of locomotive and rolling stock, TRA proposes to renew
and expand capacity at its two major workshops on the West Line at a cost
of US$1,668,000. In Taipei, new equipment for the diesel motive power and
car shops and the power plant will speed up and improve servicing of
locomotives, railcars and passenger coaches. At Kaohsiung, the purchase of
overhead cranes and an air compressor will increase the throughput of
freight cars. Benefits attributable to these two sets of investments in-
volve increased utilization of the locomotives and cars and are estimated at
lJS$198,400 per year, yielding an internal economic return of 12%.
Freight Handling Equipment
5.        The Project calls for US$1,212,500 to be invested in a 40-ton
crane, 25 heavy duty trucks and a number of tractors, trailers and forklifts
to improve TRA's inland handling operation and to assist its development of
an international container service. Benefits would accrue to TRA's two
subsidiary freight handling companies and have been estimated conservatively
as the net financial return of utilizing the equipment at a reasonable rate.
The rate of return derived is 25%.

Passenger Car Bogies
6.        As part of a continuing program started under Loan 524-CHA,
TRA proposes to meet growing demand for passenger cars to replace over-age
equipment. The old wooden bodies of the cars in question have already been
replaced by steel bodies and the conversion of the bogies would increase
considerably the working life of the coaches. Justification of the Project
not only lies in the elimination of dangerous operating conditions, but
also in increasing speeds, better riding qualities and lower maintenance
costs. The cost of the new bogies is US$682,500. To purchase completely
new cars, the cost would have been US$3,712,500, showing clear economic
justification. Unfortunately, reliable estimates are not available for
contrasting the costs of rail transport to bus transport. From previous
analysis, however, it can be safely inferred that if the coaches were not
rehabilitated at all, there would be a large economic cost of diverting
passenger traffic to roads.
Automatic Warning Devices
7.        Installation of automatic warning devices is a continuing project,
having been started under the first Bank loan. TRA proposes to install
equipment costing a total of US$487,500 at 80 highway grade crossings.
Benefits from automated, as compared to manual, devices accrue both in
savings in labor cost and improved safety of train operations. Excluding
the safety factor, the internal economic return is 15%.
Relay Interlocking System
8.        This investment is part of a continuing program, started under
Loan 603-CHA, designed to modernize interlocking plants in the nine main
stations on the West Line. The Project calls for replacement of the old
manually operated interlocking plant at Tainan station, the capacity of
which is currently constraining train throughput. The proposed automated
system, costing US$487,500, will generate benefits in the form of savings
in labor and costs of train operation totalling some US$66,000 per year.
The internal economic return is calculated at 12%.
