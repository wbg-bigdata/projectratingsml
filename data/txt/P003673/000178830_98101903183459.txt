INTEUNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOIvIENDATION OF TIE PRESIDEIT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR THE
TAIWiAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $15.0 million to
the Republic of China. Approximately $1L.1 million will be on-lent to
the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) to help finance foreign exchange
expenditures on its 1971-74 Investment Plan; about $0.9 million of the
proceeds of the proposed loan are to be used to pay for the services
of foreign consultants to be attached to the Government's Transportation
Planning Board. The proposed loan would be for a 15-year term, including
three years of grace, and carry interest at the rate of 71 per annum.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        A description of the Bank Group's past lending to China
was included in the President's Report on the Third Power Project
(No, P-916, dated April 9, 1971) which was considered by the Executive
Directors on April 27, 1971. A summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits is attached as Annex I.
3.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth to help railway
development in China. The first, (409-CHA), in an amount of $20.0
million (reduced to $17.5 million by cancellation ) was made in April
1965 to cover TRA's most urgent requirements for motive power, rolling
stock and other equipment during the first four-year period of the then
six-year Railway Investment Plan (1965-70). However, traffic increased
more rapidly than expected, necessitating the acquisition of additional
equipment to reinforce TRA's capacity, and resulting in two further
loans, of $17.5 million (52L-CHA of January 1966) and of $31.2 million
(603-CHA of May 1969), respectively. Progress in the execution of all
three projects has been satisfactory. The only major problem has been
that of slow procurement due to inadequate and cumbersome procedures
followed by TRA and Government agencies. A supervision mission discussed
and agreed upon measures to improve the situation in August 1970 and
procurement has speeded up significantly since then. Loan 409-CHA will
be closed on June 30, 1971 (the present Closing Date). Loan 524-CHA
was closed as of March 31, 1971 and Loan 603-CHA is on schedule and is
expected to be closed by the end of June 1972.
PART II - THE EC ONOIM
4.        A brief description of China's current economic position and
prospects was given in the President's Report on the Third Power Project
(c.f. paragraph 2 above). Annex II contains updated economic data.

PART III - TRANSPORT IN TAIWAN
The Need for Transport Planning
5.        Taiwan's area is about 36,0OO sq0 kms; high mountains run the
entire lenoth of the island in the central and eastern regions and occupy
about 64% of its area (see attached map). An alluvial plain in the west
accounts for another 24% while a narrow fertile valley runs close to
the east coast. Economic activity is concentrated in the 375 km. long
western plain which stretches from Keelung on the north coast to
Kaohsiung on the south. Eighty percent of the population lives in this
area which contains all of Taiwan's major cities and most of its industry.
6.        The Keelung-Kaohsiung transportation corridor traverses the
western plain. It is served by TRA's main line, a two-lane highway and
a small amount of coastal shipping. Small private railways and feeder
roads connect these main routes with centres of industrial, agricultural
and forestry activity. The less developed eastern valley is served by
a shorter and narrower gauge TRA line paralleled by an unpaved, single-
lane road. Coastal shipping is small in relative terms, but important
in connecting this region with the rest of the country since no cross-
island rail link exists and road connections over the central mountains
are poor.
7.        The country's remarkable economic development during the
sixties saw a substantial growth of traffic. Inland freight traffic
grew from 2.2 billion ton-kms to 3.8 billion ton-kms between 1959 and
1969 - an average annual increase of 5%. Passenger traffic doubled
from 8,0 billion to 15.9 billion passenger-kms during these ten years -
a growth rate of over 7% per annum.
8.        The modernization of the transport sector and the enlargement
of its capacity which the country's rapid industrialization required
has received serious attention only in the recent past. Traffic
congestion in the ports and on the highways illustrates the inadequacy
of public investment in the sector during the last decade. The present
situation is attributable largely to (a) the high rate of economic
growth, not being foreseen (GNP grew at an average rate of 10% p.a.
between 1960-70);and (b) a lack of planning and co-ordination between
the various agencies and bodies responsible for investment planning
and policy making for the transport sector.
9.        The Government has become increasingly aware of the need to
lay plans for infrastructure investment on the basis of realistic GNP
growth rate projections. A Tax Reform Commission has reviewqed the
structure of the tax-system and a number of reforms aimed at increasing
revenue to help finance infrastructure have already been implemented.
A Transportation Study financed by the United Nations Development
Programme (LYnDP) was completed in August, 1970 and the Government is



- 3-
evaluating its recommendations. Possibly the most important of these
relates to constructing a 375-km freeway along the north-south transporta-
tion axis from Keelung to Kaohsiung. Work on building a portion of the
Freeway in the North of the island has already begun with financial help
from the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Government. The Bank
has been requested to assist in financing a portion in the south of
Taiwan.
10.       The Government will face difficult decisions on a number of
other fundamentally important issues affecting transport in the next
few years.  Among these are whether or not to implement the recommenda-
tions of a recently completed study, which was financed from the
proceeds of the Bank's loan 603-CHA, on the feasibility of electrifying
TRA's operations along its western line; the question of whether, and
if so when, to build a third major sea-port at Wuchi which is located
about mid-way along the island's western coast; whether or not to
construct a new international airport; and what action should be taken
to develop an urban transportation system to service the Greater Taipei
area. The projected investment in the sector is substantial and the
Government is determined to ensure that the considerable expenditure
planned will yield maximum economic benefit.
11.       The Government's inability to evolve and apply a co-ordinated
transport policy has been evident since the early 1960s. A Committee
for Co-ordination of Transport was established in 1965 and attached to
the Government's economic planning agency, the Council for International
Economic Co-operation and Development (CIECD). The Committee's terms
of reference included the development of long-term transport planning
but most of the work actually undertaken was short-term in nature and
conducted largely on an intramodal, project-by-project basis.
12.       The Government set up a new body, the Transportation Planning
Board (TPB), in August 1970 to strengthen co-ordinated transport planning.
TPB's chairman is the Minister of Communications; it has 22 members
representing the national, provincial and municipal levels of government
as well as the private sector. It is assisted by a secretariat which
includes 20 professional staff members.
13.       TPB's major function will be to assist in the definition of
policy and the analysis of problems which have an important bearing on
transport. Its terms of reference and a tentative 1971-74 work program
were agreed upon with the Bank. TPB's work can be divided into two
broad categories: (a) recurrent items such as compilation of data,
co-ordination of planning among various transport agencies and the
review of their investment budgets, and the evaluation of the regula-
tions pertaining to the sector; (b) non-recurrent items such as (i) the
review of various studies e.g. on railway electrification, the feasibility
of building a new international airport and the new port at Wuchi, etc; and



(ii) conducting studies on subjects such as highway user chargers and
the split between rail and road traffic, and, the development of an
overall model of the transport system.
1h.       TPB1s staff, thotugh potentially able, lacks experience in
the type of work it will be engaged upon. Accordingly, the Government
has decided to retain a team of foreign consultants to assist TPB
for at least the next three years. Part of the cost of the services
of the advisory team will be financed from the proceeds of the proposed
loan; it will be composed initially of a minimum of three members - a
senior economist, a project economist and a transport planning engineer.
Additional experts would be attached to the team as required. In order
to ensure that the team has adequate back-up and to facilitate the
recruitment of high quality personnel it is intended that a consulting
firm be given a contract for the provision of the experts. The Government
is in the process of soliciting proposals.
15.       The possibility of UNDP providing finance for this team was
fully discussed with the Chinese authorities and UNIP. The Government
indicated that it would prefer the Bank to provide the necessary funds
because of its present and projected involvement in the development
of the transport sector and the fact that there were a number of other
priority projects for which UNiP financing was more suitable. The
UNDP concurred in this conclusion.
16        One of the main purposes of the proposed loan is to help TPB
develop into an organization capable of making a major contribution to
the development of the transport sector. Its effectiveness will depend
on a number of factors e.g. the quality of its staff, the responsiveness
of the Government's decision-making elements to its advice, the extent
to which the work which TPB undertakes is related to pragmatic policy
formation and evaluation as opposed to theoretical exercises in transport
economics. In essence, TPB is strategically located within the
Governmental structure and should, with the assistance of the advisory
team, be able to influence transport policy. TPB's evolution and the
extent to which it is being helped or hindered by the attitudes of
other Governmental agencies will be given special attention during
the supervision of the proposed project.
17.       An illustration of the problems of transport planning is
provided by the proposal for the Su-Ao - Hualien railway link. The
Taiwan Provincial Government has submitted a plan to the Executive
Yuan (Cabinet) to build an 80-km. rail link joining the TRA main
western line to the narrower gauge eastern line (see map); the gauge
of the eastern line would subsequently be broadened. This would
constitute the first stage of constructing a "round-the-island railway
line". Preliminary figures indicate that the project would cost
$60 million equivalent. To ensure that expenditures undertaken on
transport yield maximum benefits, the Bank stressed that the scheme



should not be launched before it had been examined from an economic
standpoint. Arrangements have been made with a foreign consulting
firm for a study of this project to be carried out on acceptable terms
of reference. The Government has informed the Bank that construction
of the rail link would not be undertaken until the study's results had
been fully discussed with the Bank and arrangements had been made,
acceptable to the Bank, to insulate TRA financially from any adverse
effects of the venture both as to capital and operating expenditures.
PART IV - THE RAILWAYS AND THE PROJECT
The Railway3 Interim Plan       -
18.       The railways used to enjoy a quasi-monopoly of transportation
(e.g. 95% of the island's freight was handled by it in 1952)e Competi-
tion from highways has however been increasing during the last two
decades. Rail traffic, in absolute terms, has more than doubled in
the last 17 years; nevertheless TRA's share of freight traffic has
dropped to 70% of the total and it now handles only 45% of the passenger
traffic.
19.       The phasing of the construction of the North-South Freeway
(c.f. paragraph 10 above) will be important for the future of the
transport system and particularly that of the railways. The growth of
road freight traffic, which increased at a rate of about 17% p.a. during
the last ten years, has been caused partly by a rail to road diversion.
Industrialization, the removal of zonal trucking restrictions, the
increase in demand for short distance hauls, the establishment of a
domestic motor car industry, and the liberalization of vehicle import
restrictions were some of the factors responsible for the shift in favor
of the highways. The railways can improve their competitiveness by
improving efficiency and adopting a more aggressive commercial strategy
but the crucial determinant of TRA's future role in Taiwan's transport
system will be governmental policy on transport pricing, regulation and
investment - particularly the last in view of the pending decisions
on the matters mentioned in paragraphs 10 and 17 above.
20.       Taking into account the present transitional stage of Taiwan's
transport sector TRA has prepared an Interim Capital Investment Plan for
1971-74.  This Plan essentially constitutes a "holding action" operation
until the formulation of an overall co-ordinated transport development
plan in which the railways future role is made clearer. It includes
only those investments which TRA will be required to make irrespective
of the presently on-going, or proposed, studies including the one on
railway electrification. The Investment Plan calls for a total
expenditure of $85.6 million equivalent, $39.6 million (about 460) of
which will be in foreign exchange. The plan was discussed during
negotiations and agreement was reached that no major changes to it would
be made without the agreement of the Government and the Bank.



-6-
The Project
21.       The major elements of the Interim Investment Plan are motive
power and rolling stock (27%), track material and equipment (265),
worLshop equipment (15%) and construction and equipment of marshalling
yards and improvements to station yards (5%). The project would cover
the execution of the Plan in 1972 and 1973 and the proposed loan would
finance part of the foreign exchange expenditures on selected items to
be made during those two years. About $h8 million (56.A%) of the
funds required would be met from TRA's internal cash generation; the
balance would come from disbursements on previous Bank loans and other
borrowings (see Annex III).
22.       The basic objectives of the Plan during 1972 and 1973 are:
(a) to improve railway management and operating abilities; (b) to replace
important railway infrastructure as part of an on-going process of
modernization; and (c) to provide a modest expansion of railway capacity
where demand has been clearly established. Some of the investments are
primarily for replacement and represent continuation of modernization
programs started under earlier Bank loans. A further 281 km. of track
between Keelung and Changhua on the West Line will be strengthened to
permit the higher train speeds and axle load which are economic and
will become common-place after implementation of the electrification
or dieselization program. Seventy-five passenger cars will be rehabil-
ated with new steel bogies to meet growing demand for passenger services.
Automatic warning devices will be installed at 80 new locations to
improve safety and reduce labor costs.  The manually operated interlocking
plant at Tainan station will be replaced by a new automatic system.
23.       The present Kaohsiung workshop and depot cannot handle growing
repair and storage requirements. They will be torn do-n and replaced by
new workshops built in suburbs. New equipment will be purchased for the
Taipei and Kaohsiung workshops to speed up and improve the servicing of
locomotives and rolling stock. Several types of freight handling equip-
ment will be acquired to improve TRA's inland freight handling operations
and assist its development of an international container service.
24.       TRA is a competently managed organization and it should be
fully capable of carrying out the project.   Its planning ability is
being improved with the help of consultants financed under Loan 603-CHA
and this should enable TRA to compete effectively with road transporta-
tion in future years. TRA's financial performance has been good; its
cash generation has been sufficient to service all debt, steadily
improve its working capital position and make a substantial contribu-
tion to investment requirements. TRA was required under the 603-CHA
Loan Agreement to achieve a 7% rate of return on its net revalued
assets by 1971; this rate was actually attained in 1969 but fell
slightly in 1970 largely because of a revaluation of TRA's land assets.
The rate of return is, however, expected to improve and reach 7.5% by



- 7 -
1974. This level of cash generation is needed in view of the major
investments TRA is contemplating. However, various studies which TPB
undertakes in the next few years may indicate a less prominent rcle
for the railways than presently envisaged; and the Governmentts
investments decisions could reflect this conclusion. In this event
these financial targets may have to be reviewed.
25.       TRA's earnings in recent years would have been higher had it
not been required to carry certain categories of traffic such as military
personnel and freight, and Government employees at "special privilege"
rates and fares. It is estimated that about $8 million in revenues were
lost on account of these arrangements in 1969. During negotiations the
Government agreed, in principle, that these rates and fares should be
raised to at least the marginal cost to TRA, of carrying these categories
of traffic, or if not, that the Government will pay TRA the difference
between the subsidized level of the tariffs and the pertinent marginal
cost. The level of these "marginal", rates can only be determined
accurately after the completion of a study being financed from the
proceeds of loan 603-CHA on the development of a cost-based tariff
system for TRA.
26.       The challenge posed to TRA by increasing competition from
highways has been referred to in paragraph 19 above. TRA, to carry out
its functions in a more competitive environment, will have to improve
its planning capability, commercial strategies and the flexibility of
the management of its operations. In particular, it will have to
expeditiously determine and apply appropriate tariffs for various
kinds of traffic in response to changing circumstances. Also, it will
be most important for TRA to offer wages and salaries which are
sufficiently attractive to retain a suitably qualified and efficient
staff. It was agreed during negotiations that a study under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, covering an evaluation of tariff
setting procedures and TRA's salary structure would be completed by
mid-1972. The findings of the study will be discussed with the Bank
to determine what action would be appropriate to implement its
recommendations.
27.       All items to be financed out of the proceeds of the proposed
Bank loan will be procured through international competitive bidding,
in accordance with the procedures of the Bank, except for the freight
handling equipment, which for standardization purposes will be procured
from specific suppliers; similar equipment was procured under the
previous Bank loan (603-CHA) after international competitive bidding
and it is appropriate for TRA to negotiate the purchase of these items
directly with the present suppliers, especially since the number of
units to be procured is small relative to those now on hand. The
foreign exchange involved is estimated at US$800,000 or about 5% of
the total amount of the loan.



- 8 -
28.       The foreign cost of the project was calculated on the assumlp-
tion that all rolling stock and motive power will be procured from
foreign firms; this will be true for diesel locomotives and is likely
to be the case for rolling stock since the two local firms equipped
for such manufacturing are currently working at full capacity. Should
these local firms enter the bidding they will be allowed the usual
preference of 151 or the relevant level of customs duties (whichever
is lower) when comparisons are made with bids submitted by foreign
suppliers. If the local firms win contracts for the rolling stock,
which are estimated at US$2.3 million, up to US$600,000 in local
currency costs would be financed under the proposed loan.
29.       The economic rate of return on quantifiable items, wzhich account
for 60Z of the proposed project, ranges between 12 to 25%.   The major
sources of benefit are from savings in operating and capital costs and
from increased utilization of productive equipment. The remaining 40%
of the Project is made up of over 60 small, unrelated investments on
which no quantification of benefits has been atterpted. These invest-
ments appear to have sound justification based on common sense and
technical criteria.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUT21TS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of China and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank, the Province of Taiwan
and the Taiwan Railway Administration, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
31.       The draft loan documents are substantially in the form usually
used for railway projects and follow closely the documents used for the
previous three loans. In addition, provisions are made in the draft
loan documents for cross defaults under the previous two Loan Agreements
and the new Loan Agreement.
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOINMENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
