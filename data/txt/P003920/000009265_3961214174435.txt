IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
POWER SECTOR EFFICIENCY PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3097-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Sector
Efficiency Project in Indonesia, for which Loan No. 3097-IND, in the amount of US$ 337
million equivalent was approved on June 22, 1989 and made effective on October 6,
1989. Cofinancing for the project was provided by the Government of Netherlands to the
extent of US$ 10 million equivalent.
The loan closing date was extended by one year. to December 31, 1995 (original
closing date was December 31 , 1994). A partial loan proceeds cancellation in the amount
of US$ 16 million was made in December 1994. The loan account was closed on May
14, 1996, with an undisbursed balance of US$ 11.7 million canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Stephen Howes. Financial Economist, and Yuling
Zhou, Operations Officer, EA3IE, and reviewed by Peter R. Scherer, Chief, EA3IE, and
Richard A. Calkins, Operations Adviser, EA3DR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun in January 1996 prior to the Bank's ICR
mission to Indonesia from March 11 to 22, 1996. It is based on material in the project
file, and on information and comments provided by the implementing agency, PT PLN
(Persero). The aide memoire of the ICR mission is attached as Annex A. The borrower's
own evaluation report is attached as Annex C.

POWER SECTOR EFFICIENCY PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3097-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Bank involvement in the electricity subsector in Indonesia began in 1968. For the first
two decades, the focus was on first the creation of a national electric utility (which occurred in
1972) and then on system expansion. By the time of the late eighties, attention was beginning to
shift more to sectoral efficiency. The Power Sector Efficiency Project supported the traditional
objective of system development by financing PLN's distribution expansion needs. But it also
responded to the increased focus on efficiency by packaging together a number of technical and
institutional components to improve the operating efficiency of some of PLN's existing assets
(diesel and hydro power plants) as well as to improve organizational efficiency. The total
amount of the loan was US$ 337.0 million. The loan was signed on July 21, 1989, and became
effective on October 6, 1989. The loan closing date was extended by one year to December 31,
1995.
Project Objectives
2.    The overall objective of the project was to improve the economic, technical and
institutional efficiency of the power sector. To support this overall objective, the project had
three specific objectives:
(i) Physical objective: to improve the operation of PLN's generation, transmission and
distribution facilities by: (a) improving the operation and maintenance of selected
diesel power plants; (b) renovating seven small hydropower plants in Java to recover
capacity and maximize energy output; (c) investing in distribution facilities to
support PLN's projected sales increases in 1990-91 and 1991; (d) augmenting PLN's
telecommunications facilities in Java; and (e) providing technical assistance and
training in the operation of diesel power plants, operation and maintenance of major
steam power plants, and the operation, maintenance and management of distribution
facilities;
(ii) Institutional objective: to strengthen the administrative, financial and management
functions of PLN, by providing technical assistance and training in general
accounting and cash management, and financial and corporate planning; and
(iii) Policy objective: to introduce appropriate efficiency-improving policy measures by:
(a) establishing an institutional mechanism to review and advise the Government on
all price adjustments in the energy sector; (b) establishing an information system to
provide costs for the rural electrification component of PLN's investments and



ii
operations; and (c) introducing suitable regulatory and contractual measures to
utilize some of the captive generating capacity to reduce investment costs and
promote cogeneration by industry.
3.    The objectives remained unchanged for the duration of the project. They were important,
clear and, for the most part, realistic. While the project was not especially risky or demanding,
the number of objectives and sub-objectives is indicative of the complexity of the project.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The project's outcome was satisfactory. It was successful in substantially achieving
physical, policy and institutional objectives. These achievements would seem to be highly
sustainable. Physical program targets were generally met, though not on time, and in some cases
exceeded.  The technical assistance components were in general successful.  The policy
components were substantially met, though not fully and not without significant delays. The re-
estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.7%, slightly below the SAR's estimate of
18.3%.
5.    The actual cost of the project (excluding IDC) was US$ 434.1 million, compared to an
appraisal estimate of US$ 556.5. The main cost difference was on the distribution investment
component. Other cofinancing resources were originally intended to help finance PLN's
distribution facilities in 1990/91 and 1991/92. However, the source of the cofinancing was never
identified and no distribution cofinancing ended up being included in the project. In addition,
there was a partial loan cancellation in the amount of US$ 16.0 million from the unallocated
funds in January 1995 upon the request of the Borrower. The remaining undisbursed balance of
about US$ 11.7 million was canceled in May 1996 when the loan account was closed.
6.    The SAR estimate of time from loan signing to physical completion was about 60
months. This implementation period had to be extended by 12 months, mainly because of the
delays in selecting consultants and protracted procurement procedures for equipment and
materials.
7.     In terms of implementation, the Borrower's procurement practices and consultant
selection procedures substantially delayed procurement of both goods and consultants. An
increase in fuel prices, while welcome in itself, made the break-even covenant for PLN's
outside-Java operations impossible to meet; good project preparation, on the technical side was
an important factor contributing to the project's success.
8.    Both the Bank's and the Borrower's performance under the project has been satisfactory.
Summary Of Findings, Future Operations, And Key Lessons Learned
9.    The outcome of the project is satisfactory. The project met most of its physical,
institutional and policy objectives and the benefits from the project are highly likely to be
sustainable.



iii
10.  It is expected that the project will be operated as planned. The physical components have
been taken over by PLN's various operational departments, become an integrated part of PLN's
operations and will be productive for many years. Results and recommendations from the
technical assistance have already been or are being incorporated into PLN's management
practices. The Bank will continue to monitor the project's operation through its on-going
lending and institutional development programs and policy dialogue with GOI/PLN. Operational
plans to ensure the sustainability of the outcome achieved under the project discussed with PLN
during the ICR mission and are attached to this ICR.
11.   Several specific key lessons, which have operational and strategic implications for the
design of future power sector projects, can be drawn from this project:
(a) Covenants: experience with the captive power and energy pricing covenants indicates
that, to be effective, covenants should be realistic, dated, backed up by research and
action plans, and systematically pursued and reviewed.
(b) Establishment of a central Project Management Unit (PMU) could have benefited
the overall project coordination and accountability. If a PMU is not established, then,
as a minimum, implementation reports on all individual components should be required
upon their completion.
(c) Technical assistance: well-targeted technical assistance, which is taken ownership of
by PLN, can be very productive. Bank's supervision of technical assistance activities
should focus not only on process and minimizing delays, but also on substance and
links with Bank's policy dialogue.
(d) Performance monitoring: Although improvements in PLN efficiency was the aim of
the project, there was no regular performance monitoring during supervision. Explicit
performance monitoring has been built into the Bank's most recent loan to PLN for the
Second Power Transmission & Distribution Project (Loan 3978-IND).
(e) Cumbersome procurement processes are a leading cause of project implementation
delays. PLN's procurement processes result in a lengthy procurement cycle adding
delays and unnecessary costs to the projects that it undertakes. Speedier procurement
processing and more efficient inventory management and materials handling are key to
increasing efficiency of the investment program.

POWER SECTOR EFFICIENCY PROJECT
(LOAN 3097-IND)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    The overall objective of the project was to increase the efficiency of the power
sector in Indonesia. The project had three main objectives, each with its own sub-
objectives:
(i) Physical objective: to improve the operation of PLN's generation,
transmission and distribution facilities:
(a)  by improving the operation and maintenance of selected diesel power
plants operated by PLN, including their rehabilitation and relocation as
required;
(b)  by renovating seven small hydropower plants operated by PLN in Java
to recover capacity and maximize energy output;
(c)  by investing in distribution facilities to support PLN's projected sales
increases in 1990-91 and 1991;
(d)  by augmenting PLN's telecommunications facilities in Java; and
(e)  by providing technical assistance and training in:
* operation of diesel power plants;
* operation and maintenance of major steam power plants;
* operation, maintenance and management of distribution facilities;
(ii) Institutional objective: to strengthen the administrative, financial and
management functions of PLN, by providing technical assistance and training
in:
*   general accounting and cash management;
*   financial planning and corporate planning; and
(iii) Policy objective: to introduce appropriate efficiency-improving policy
measures:
(a) by establishing an institutional mechanism to review and advise the
Government on all price adjustments in the energy sector;



- 2 -
(b)  by establishing an information system to provide costs for the rural
electrification component of PLN's investments and operations; I and
(c)  by introducing suitable regulatory and contractual measures to utilize
some of the captive generating capacity to reduce investment costs and
promote cogeneration by industry.
2.     The objectives remained unchanged for the duration of the project. They were
important, clear and. for the most part, realistic. While the project was not especially
risky or demanding, the number of objectives and sub-objectives is indicative of the
complexity of the project.
3.    Financial covenants: In addition to the covenants supporting the above policy
objectives, there were important financial covenants. Of these, the most important ones
were to achieve annually an eight per cent rate of return on PLN's Java operations and to
achieve break-even on PLN's outside-Java operations beginning FY1990/91. The latter
covenant was successively rolled-over. In 1994, both covenants were replaced under
Loan 3761-IND by a single eight percent rate-of-return covenant for PLN's entire
operation in Indonesia.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Overall Project Objective
4.     Overall objective: The overall objective of the project was to increase sectoral
efficiency. PLN, the national utility, has gone over the period of the project (1990-1995)
from being a loss-maker to being a substantial profit-maker without an increase in the real
value of tariffs. This indicates an underlying improvement in efficiency. The project
selected several technical targets to measure sectoral efficiency improvements, e.g.,
capacity utilization and system losses. Most of these targets were achieved or exceeded
(see Table 6 in Part II). In retrospect though, these targets were not very demanding.
Moreover, any overall gains in sectoral efficiency can not be attributed to this one project
which constituted only a small part of PLN's overall investment program during the
project period. Moreover, although improving efficiency was the stated objective of the
project, the largest component was in fact distribution expansion. To judge the success of
the project, its success in meeting its specific objectives should be assessed. This is done
below.
5.    Internal rate of return: For practical purposes, it is impossible to separate out the
benefits attributable to the individual power projects that form a part of a least-cost
development plan. Project justification was therefore based in the SAR on PLN's entire
development program for Java for the time period, 1988/89-1990/91, of which the project
1'  This is regarded as a policy objective since cost separation would be required as a basis for explicit subsidy-
setting for rural electrification.



was envisaged to be a part. This delivered a forecast economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) of 18.3%. This EIRR has been recalculated using updated data for the period
1989/90-1995/96 which, due to implementation delays, is the period the project ended up
covering. The re-estimated EIRR is 15.7%. The detailed ex-post EIRR calculation is
presented in Annex D.
6.    One reason why the ex-post EIRR fell short of the appraisal estimate is the over-
expansion in generating capacity which occurred in the early 90's. Starting in 1991, PLN
began accelerating its system expansion based on a perception at that time that demand
growth would outstrip earlier forecasts. This turned out to be over-optimistic. While the
increase in peak load between 1989/90 and 1994/95 was almost on target (3,379 MW
actual vs. 3,227 MW forecast at project appraisal), the actual increment in generating
capacity turned to be 4,600 MW, far greater than the appraisal forecast of 2,600 MW.
This issue has been repeatedly raised by the Bank in its policy dialogue. In a recent loan
for the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project, PLN covenanted to achieve
a reserve margin of 30% by 1999.
Review of Physical Objectives
7.    Diesel rehabilitation and relocation:  A total of 109 units were rehabilitated
using Bank funding for a gain of 143 MW. This exceeded the SAR target of 82 units for
a capacity gain of 133 MW. Over the same period (1991/92-1994/95), an additional 28
units were rehabilitated using Dutch funds and an additional 21 units using PLN's own
funds. The rehabilitation using Dutch sources was less than expected due to the
termination of Dutch aid to Indonesia in June 1992. Substantial relocation of diesel units
was also carried out using PLN's own funds. Between 1991/92 and 1994/95, 125 units
with a total capacity of 65 MW were relocated. This exceeded the SAR target of 73
units. Total cost for the rehabilitation was US$ 18.3 million, compared to the SAR
estimate of US$ 18.4 million.
8.    Small hydropower renovation: The Bank loan provided for the procurement and
installation of electrical and mechanical equipment, and engineering and construction
supervision of renovation works on seven hydro power stations. During dismantling of
the turbines and generators, new problems were found at most plants, and, instead of the
11 generating units identified in the feasibility study, 22 units were refurbished. The
stations are now in commercial operation and the taking over certificate (TOC) has been
issued to all units except one for which the turbine was damaged during the test run. The
increased scope led to an increased cost by about 77% (from US$ 24.1 million to US$
42.6 million), but the re-estimated EIRRs (given in Table 6e) are still impressive (12-35%
ex-post vs. 15-32% ex-ante).
9.    Distribution investment: The project was originally intended to finance PLN's
Java non-rural distribution investment program for the years of 1990/91 and 1991/92.
However, on account of procurement delays, delivery of the materials financed under the
loan was not complete until March 1995, about three years behind schedule. The project
therefore financed instead PLN's 1993/94 and 1994/95 Java non-rural distribution
program. This change in the time-slice makes the SAR investment targets for 1990/91



- 4 -
and 1991/92 irrelevant as project targets. However, it can be noted from Table 6a (in Part
II, Statistical Tables) that PLN achieved or exceeded mrost of its distribution targets in
1990/91, but not in 1991/92, due to a budget shortage.
10.   The actual cost of the distribution component was much lower than the SAR
estimate ($328 million versus $471 million). In the SAR, US$ 68 million of cofinancing
funds for distribution expansion were included in the cost estimates. However, the source
of the cofinancing was never identified and no distribution cofinancing ended up being
included in the project.
11.   Expansion of PLN's telecommunicationsfacilities: The project initially included
the provision of trunk telecommunications facilities in West Java (about 500 km of fiber
optic cables), but this was later amended to extend the network to Central Java. The loan
financed  equipment  and  engineering  services  and  construction  supervision.
Commissioning of new facilities took place in June 1995, with final hand-over scheduled
for June 1996.  The final performance of the network was measured during
commissioning and was demonstrated to have met or exceeded the requirements of the
contract in all areas. PLN now has a comprehensive and modern communications
network to support all of its operations in West Java and part of Central Java. The
network also has much spare capacity, and PLN is currently considering various options
to increase utilization.
12.   Because of the extended scope of work as mentioned above, the actual cost went
up to US$ 28.9 million from the SAR estimate of US$ 16.3 million.
Review of Institutional Development Objectives
13.    Training in the operation of diesel power plants: Funding for training and for
the purchase of training equipment was to be provided under a Dutch grant. However,
the suspension of all Dutch aid to Indonesia in June 1992 resulted in limited
implementation of this component.
14.   Training in the operation and maintenance of major steam power plants: This
was funded by UK ODA prior to loan effectiveness (beginning in 1987-88), and was not
supervised as part of the project.
15.   Distribution Management Program (DMP): The consultancy for this component
was undertaken between 1991 and 1993. The consultants developed a DMP Master Plan,
which identified (first in October 1991) 14 activities to be undertaken to improve PLN's
distribution management. PLN established in early 1994 a Working Group headed by
PLN's Director of Operations and a Steering Committee headed by the President Director
to carry out priority implementation of three activities: customer information system,
distribution information system and data communications. Although there has not yet
been a comprehensive follow-up, the Working Group is still in operation and various
pilots have been initiated. Further follow-up initiatives arising from this consultancy will
be undertaken by PLN's Jakarta distribution operations under the Bank financed Second



- 5 -
Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 3978-IND), for which the loan
agreement was signed in March 1996.
16.   Technical assistance for general accounting and cash management:  The
impetus for this TA came from the fact that in the eighties PLN's audited accounts were
delayed and received qualified opinions on a number of occasions (including 1985/86 and
1986/87, received during the course of the project preparation). The general accounting
consultancy, aimed at improving PLN's accounting policies and systems, and preparing
updated accounting manuals, commenced in September 1991 (about 18 months behind
the schedule) and was completed in December 1994. New accounting policies, in line
with the best international practices. have been implemented and accompanying manuals
completed, and relevant training undertaken. PLN's accounts have been produced more
quickly and have received unqualified opinions from the auditors in recent years.
17.   Draft TOR for improving PLN's cash management were agreed with the Bank.
PLN hired local consultants using its own funds prior to the loan approval. Much of the
work was also completed prior to the loan approval due to the delays in the project
processing. This component was not supervised by the Bank.
18.   Technical assistance for financial and corporate planning: The consultancy
commenced in October 1991 and continued throughout the remainder of the project
period. The consultants prepared a Master Plan for Corporate Planning in April 1993.
The plan recommended establishment of a separate corporate planning division and
consolidation of corporate and financial planning activities with additional staffing.
These recommendations were largely adopted. A corporate planning division was
established by PLN in 1995. The consultants also assisted PLN in preparation of a five-
year corporate plan (1994-1998) and an Action Plan for PLN's Institutional
Development, which was endorsed by the PLN Board. Many recommendations were
implemented in a major reorganization. For improvement of financial planning, the
consultants developed a new software which is replacing the old one used within PLN.
The new software is an improvement in several ways, and has been officially adopted by
PLN, though currently the old and new software are being used in parallel runs. Further
training is required and planned for use in the new software, which will be especially
useful in producing consolidated financial projections since PLN now has two
subsidiaries, with more intended.
Review of Policy Support Objective
19.  Institutional mechanism to advise GOI on energy price adjustments: One of the
objectives of the project was to have GOI take a coordinated approach for price setting by
establishing a energy pricing task-force and a supporting technical energy pricing unit. In
fact, the task-force was never established; the energy pricing unit also was not created,
but the work was assigned to the energy planning directorate within MME. In hindsight,
it is clear that energy prices are adjusted too infrequently to make the establishment of an
energy pricing task force a feasible proposition. However, progress was made on the
underlying goal of improving energy pricing. In 1993, GOI aligned domestic petroleum



- 6 -
fuel prices to international prices (except for kerosene); and in 1994, an automatic
adjustment mechanism was implemented for the electricity tariff.
20.   Information system to provide costs for PLN's rural electrification program:
PLN does now provide separate income statements for its rural electrification program.
Although the segregation of accounts requires further development, some progress was
made towards this objective.
21.   Utilization by PLN of captive generating capacity: Another stated policy
objective of the project was to link captive generating capacity to the PLN grid. An
action plan for a pilot to achieve this objective was tabled at the loan negotiations, but it
lacked concrete policies and little progress was made. This led to a more fundamental
rethink, which resulted in an agreement between the Bank and GOI that the latter would
implement a Small Power Purchase Tariff, under which PLN would offer a purchased-
power tariff to small (including captive) generators that would reflect PLN's avoided cost
of power generation. This was implemented in December 1995, and provides a possible
vehicle by which this objective of the project can be achieved, although with considerable
delay. In addition, the unbundling currently underway on Java will lead eventually to an
open-access regime, under which captive, PLN and private generators will compete to
sell power through the grid directly to distribution companies and other large end-users.
Compliance with Financial Covenants
22.   While delay of the project contributed to an important tariff increase, full
compliance with financial covenants was achieved only by successive "roll-overs" of one
of the covenants. The project was delayed after appraisal for over a year in order to secure
a tariff increase required to meet the existing rate-of-return (ROR) financial covenants.
This strategy was successful. The Government approved an average increase in tariff
rates of about 25% effective April 1, 1989. This enabled PLN to meet the 8% ROR target
for Java. However, PLN was never able to achieve break-even outside of Java where its
operations are far less profitable. Indeed, when GOI increased fuel prices (in accordance
with Bank advice), the outside-Java position deteriorated due to a heavy reliance on
diesel. Compliance with the break-even covenant could only be achieved by repeated
postponement of the target date. Not surprisingly, having different financial targets for
different regions when a principle of uniform tariffs implied both regions would face the
same tariffs proved unworkable. The move back to a single ROR covenant in 1994 was
well-advised.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Implementation Record
23.   The implementation of the project was satisfactory. Physical and institutional
project components were completed, and targets met or exceeded. Implementation was,
however, characterized by substantial delays. For those components for which the SAR



gave implementation schedules, the delays were between one and three years (the longest
delay was for the distribution component).
Major Factors Affecting the Project
24.   Procurement of goods and consulting services: The Borrower's procurement
practices and consultant selection procedures substantially delayed procurement of both
goods and consultants. This was a key contributing factor in the one year loan extension.
There were lengthy delays between bid closing date and bid evaluation, delays between
receipt of Bank's no objection letter (NOL) and preparation of final contract document,
and in posting of the performance bonds by contractors.
25.  Increase infuelprices: The increase in fuel prices, while welcome in itself, made
the break-even covenant for PLN's outside-Java operations impossible to meet on
account of its reliance on oil.
26.   Good project preparation: The extensive technical pre-project preparation work
was an important factor contributing to the project's success. Some of the preparation
was financed by PLN under earlier projects.  The diesel renovation component
preparation was directly contributed by the Bank under the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP).
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
27.   The achievements and benefits of the project are sustainable. The physical
investments will be productive for many years. In particular, the telecommunications
project has provided PLN with a state-of-the-art communications technology which will
provide valuable service to the company for years to come provided that some of the
initiatives currently under consideration to increase its utilization are undertaken. Results
and recommendations from the technical assistance have already been or are being
incorporated into PLN's management practices.  For example, the accounting TA
produced manuals which are now the basis of PLN's accounting. PLN's corporate
planning has been upgraded, and some of the restructuring detailed with the help of the
corporate planning consultants has been undertaken. PLN has decided to adopt the new
financial planning software developed under the financial planning consultancy, and its
financial planning has already improved greatly. Recommendations from the DMP TA
are still being pursued by PLN, including under the Second Power Transmission and
Distribution Project (Loan 3978-IND).
28.   Operational Plans to ensure the sustainability of results achieved under the project
were discussed and agreed with PLN's management during the ICR mission. These plans
are presented in Annex B.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
29.   Overall, the Bank's performance has been satisfactory.  With regards to
identification, the project was innovative for the sector, both in terms of specific
components (e.g. telecommunications) and the general thrust of the project. It was the
first power project in Indonesia to make efficiency improvement an explicit project
objective alongside system expansion.
30.   With regards to preparation, as commented earlier, one reason for the project's
success was the extensive technical pre-project preparation work. Some of this was
financed by PLN under earlier projects.  The diesel renovation preparation was
contributed directly by the Bank under the ESMAP project. Loan preparation was also
used effectively in the tariff dialogue. Approval of the Board was made conditional on a
substantial tariff increase. The only area where preparation was less than thorough was in
relation to some of the policy components which were not all well thought through
(paras. 19 and 21).
31.   Appraisal was also carried out successfully.  The major risk was correctly
identified, namely procurement delays. Attempts were made to mitigate these risks,
though these proved unsuccessful. The implementation plan for the project components
was simple, but sufficiently clear to quantify the extent of the delays which occurred.
Performance indicators were provided for the physical, but not the institutional,
components of the project. Project complexity could have been reduced at the time of
appraisal by removing from the project particular components which were to be financed
by PLN or other (unspecified) donors and which inevitably went unsupervised.
32.   During supervision, the Bank successfully maintained good working relations
with PLN. A total of seven supervision missions were fielded during the project
implementation period. Specialists were brought out to supervise particular components
when required. The project was supervised by two task managers, with no discernible
negative impact on project continuity and outcome. The weaker aspects of supervision
were technical assistance, where the emphasis was on process (reducing delays) rather
than substance, and the monitoring of covenants which was neglected. In addition, the
lack of regular performance monitoring undermined the project objective of increasing
sector efficiency.
33.   Project implementation involved no deviations from  Bank policies and
procedures.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
34.   PLN's and GOI's performance was satisfactory. Macroeconomic and sectoral
policies were generally favorable and improving.  The project was carried out
successfully and targets were met.  Counterpart funds were available and audit



-9-
requirements were met. Ownership was, in the main, taken of the technical assistance,
close cooperation ensured knowledge-transfer, and ongoing use is now being made of the
consultants' work. Against this overall satisfactory rating, two less positive aspects of the
borrower's performance must also be noted. First, as mentioned previously, the project
suffered from substantial delays in implementation due to lengthy procurement times
driven by requirement imposed by GOI procurement procedures, as well as cumbersome,
lengthy and inefficient procurement procedures and practices internal to PLN. Second,
although compliance with covenants was satisfactory in general, not all covenants were
complied with (see paras. 19-22).
G. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
35.   The outcome of the project is satisfactory. The projects met most of its physical,
institutional and policy objectives and the benefits from the project are likely to be
sustainable.
36.   The EIRR for the project has been re-estimated at 15.7%. Individual EIRRs for
the hydro renovation component were also calculated and ranged from 12-35% with a
cumulative EIRR at 25%. Individual EIRRs for the renovated diesels were not calculated
due to a lack of data.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
37.   It is expected that the project will be operated as planned.  The physical
components have been taken over by PLN's various operational departments and have
become an integrated part of PLN's entire operations.  Proper training has been
conducted and comprehensively documented operation and maintenance procedures have
been put in place. In order to make better use of the capacity of the Java West Operations
Telecommunications System (JWOTS) financed under the project, a joint utilization
program is being developed with PT Telkom, the national telecommunications company
in Indonesia.  Furthermore, the JWOTS system  provides many types of data
communications interfaces linking all PLN sites and is suitable for establishing a wide
area network, which is currently at the planning phase. To implement the activities
identified by the Distribution Management Program (DMP), PLN has setup steering
committees as well as working groups, and various DMP pilots have been initiated.
38.   Plans for future operations are presented in Annex B. The Bank will continue to
monitor the project's operation through its on-going lending and institutional
development programs and policy dialogue with GOI/PLN.

I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
39.   Several specific key lessons, which have operational and strategic implications for
the design of future power sector projects, can be drawn from this project. These are
discussed in the following.
40.   Covenants: Experience with the captive power and energy pricing covenants
indicates that, to be effective, covenants should be (a) realistic, (b) dated, (c) backed up
by research and action plans, and (d) systematically pursued and reviewed.
41.   Establishment of a central Project Management Unit (PMU) could benefit
overall project coordination and accountability: The project did not require PLN, the
implementing agency, to establish a central project management and implementation
supervision unit. As a result, no senior PLN manager was responsible for monitoring
progress and the outcome of the project, and for initiating corrective actions in a timely
manner. This also made it difficult for the Bank to supervise the project while adding to
the time and financial resources devoted to the supervision activity. If a PMU is not
established, then at least implementation reports on all individual components should be
required upon their completion.
42.   Technical Assistance: Well-targeted technical assistance programs (such as the
financial planning and accounting financed under the project), which are taken ownership
of by PLN, can be very productive. Bank's supervision of technical assistance activities
should focus not only on process and minimizing delays, but also on substance and links
with Bank's policy dialogue. For example, the corporate planning and DMP technical
assistance recommendations are only now being taken up by the Bank under the Second
Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 3978-IND).
43.   Performance monitoring: Although improvements in PLN efficiency was the
aim of the project, there was no regular performance monitoring during supervision.
Explicit performance monitoring has since built in the Bank's loans to PLN starting with
the Second Power Transmission & Distribution Project (Loan 3978-IND).
44.   Cumbersome procurement processes are  a leading  cause  of project
implementation delays: PLN's procurement process results in a lengthy procurement
cycle adding delays and unnecessary costs to projects that it undertakes. Speedier
procurement processing and more efficient inventory management and materials handling
are key to increasing the efficiency of its investment program.

POWER SECTOR EFFICIENCY PROJECT
(LOAN 3097-IND)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR) MISSION
AIDE MEMOIRE
Introduction
1.    This Aide Memoire records the findings of a World Bank Mission comprising Mr.
Stephen Howes, Mrs. Judith Magyari and Mr. Yuling Zhou, who visited Indonesia during
March 11 through March 22, 1996, for preparation of the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) for the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND). The mission
records its thanks to PLN staff for the assistance provided in the ICR preparation and
acknowledges the courtesies and cooperation extended to it during its visit.
Activities Undertaken by Mission
2.    The mission: (i) collected the data necessary to prepare the statistical tables in the
ICR; and (ii) reviewed other background data to develop its analysis. Discussions were
held with PLN staff to better understand and interpret the available data. The project was
assessed with regard to the degree of achievement of the objectives, prospects of its
sustainability, Bank and Borrower performance, and the lessons learned. In addition, the
mission provided advice and support to the Borrower for preparing its own contribution
to the ICR.
Overall Project Objective
3.    The overall objective of the project was to increase sectoral efficiency. PLN has
gone over the period of the project (1990-1995) from being a loss-maker to being a
substantial profit-maker without an increase in the real value of tariffs. This indicates an
underlying improvement in efficiency. The project selected targets for four technical
indicators to measure sectoral efficiency, i.e., capacity utilization, reserve margin, system
losses, and fuel consumption. Some, but not all, of the sectoral targets were reached.
Realistically though, any overall gains in sectoral efficiency cannot be attributed to this
one project which constituted only a small part of PLN's overall investment program. To
judge the success of the project, its specific activities and objectives should be assessed.



ICR Mission Aide Memoire           - 27 -                           Annex A
Review of Investment Activities
4.    Diesel Rehabilitation and Relocation   A total of 109 diesel units were
rehabilitated using Bank funding for a capacity gain of 143 MW. This exceeded the SAR
target of 82 units for a capacity gain of 133 MW. Over the same period (1991/92 -
1994/95), an additional 28 units were rehabilitated using the Dutch funds and an
additional 21 units using PLN's own funds. The rehabilitation using the Dutch financing
was less than expected due to the termination of Dutch aid to Indonesia in 1992.
Substantial relocation of diesel units was also carried out using PLN's own funds.
Between 1991/92 and 1994/95, 125 units with a total capacity of 65 MW were relocated.
This exceeded the SAR target of 73 units.
5.    Hydro Renovation The Bank loan provided for the procurement and installation
of electrical and mechanical equipment, and engineering and construction supervision of
renovation works on seven hydro stations. During dismantling of the turbines and
generators new problems were found at most plants, and instead of the 11 generating
units identified in the feasibility study, 22 units needed to be refurbished, which caused
cost increase. Refurbishment of the 22 generating units was completed. The stations are
in commercial operation and the taking over certificate (TOC) has been issued to all but
one unit for which the turbine was damaged during the test run.
6.    Distribution Investment The project was intended to finance PLN's Java non-
rural distribution investment program for the years of 1990/91 and 1991/92. However,
delivery of the materials financed under the loan was not complete until March 1995,
about three years behind schedule, so the project thus financed instead PLN's 1993/94
and 1994/95 Java non-rural distribution program. This change in the time-slice makes
the SAR investment targets for 1990/91 and 1991/92 irrelevant as project targets.
However, it can be noted that PLN achieved or exceeded most of its distribution targets in
1990/91, but not in 1991/92, due to a budget shortage.
7.    Expansion of PLN's Telecommunications Facilities The project initially included
the provision of trunk telecommunications facilities in West Java (about 500 km of fiber
optic cables), but this was later amended to extend the network to Central Java. The loan
financed equipment and engineering services and construction supervision.
Commissioning of new facilities took place in June 1995, with final hand-over scheduled
for May/June 1996. The final performance of the network was measured during the
commissioning and system availability tests and was demonstrated to have met or
exceeded the requirements of the contract in all areas. PLN now has a comprehensive
and modern communications network to support all of its operations in West Java and
part of Central Java. The network also has the spare capacity to satisfy additional needs
in the medium term.

Review of TA Activities
8.    Distribution Management Program (DMP)  The consultancy was undertaken
between 1991 and 1993. The consultants developed a DMP Master Plan which identified
14 activities to be undertaken to improve PLN's distribution management.  PLN
established in early 1994 a Working Group and a Steering Committee to carry out
priority implementation of three activities: customer information system, distribution
information system and data communications. Although there has not yet been a
comprehensive follow-up, various pilots have been initiated. Further follow-up initiatives
arising from this consultancy will be undertaken under the Bank financed Second Power
Transmission and Distribution Project.
9.    Technical Assistance for General Accounting    The general accounting
consultancy, aimed at improving PLN's accounting policies and systems, and preparing
updated accounting manuals, commenced in September 1991 (about 18 months behind
schedule) and was completed in December 1994. New accounting policies, which in the
main follow best international practice, have been implemented and accompanying
manuals completed, and relevant training undertaken. PLN's recent accounts have
received unqualified auditor opinions (in contrast to the late eighties).
10.   Technical Assistance for Financial and Corporate Planning  The consultancy
commenced in October 1991 (about 18 months behind schedule) and continued
throughout the remainder of the project life. The consultant prepared a Master Plan for
Corporate Planning in April 1993. The plan recommended establishment of a separate
corporate planning division and consolidation of corporate and financial planning
activities with additional staffing. These recommendations were largely adopted. A
corporate planning division was established by PLN in 1995. The consultant also
assisted PLN in preparation of a five-year corporate plan (1994-1998) and an Action Plan
for PLN's Institutional Development, which was endorsed by the PLN Board. Many
recommendations were implemented in a major reorganization. For improvement of
financial planning, the consultant developed a new software which is replacing the old
one used within PLN. The new software is an improvement in several ways, and has
been officially adopted by PLN, though currently the old and new software are being
used in parallel runs. Further training is required and planned for use in the new software,
which will be especially useful in producing consolidated financial projections since PLN
has created new subsidiaries.
Review of Policy Support Objectives
11.  Institutional Mechanism to Advise GOI on Energy Price Adjustment One of the
stated objectives of the project was to have GOI take a coordinated approach for price
setting by establishing a energy pricing task-force and a supporting technical energy
pricing unit. In fact, the task-force was never established; the energy pricing unit also
was not created, but the work was assigned to the energy planning directorate within



ICR Mission Aide Memoire           - 29 -                           Annex A
MME. In hindsight, it is clear that energy prices are adjusted too infrequently to make
the establishment of an energy pricing task force a feasible proposition. However,
progress was made on the underlying goal of improving energy pricing. In 1993, GOI
aligned domestic petroleum fuel prices to international prices (except for kerosene); and
in 1994, an automatic adjustment mechanism was implemented for the electricity tariff.
12.   Utilization by PLN of Captive Generating Capacity  Another stated policy
objective of the project was to link captive generating capacity to the PLN grid. An
action plan for a pilot to achieve this objective was tabled at the loan negotiations, but it
lacked concrete policies and little progress was made. This led to a more fundamental
rethink, which resulted in an agreement between the Bank and GOI that the latter would
implement a Small Power Purchase Tariff, under which PLN is now offering a
purchased-power tariff to small (including captive) generators that reflect PLN's avoided
cost of power generation. This was implemented in December 1995, and provides a
possible vehicle by which this objective of the project can be achieved, although with
considerable delay.
Summary Assessment
13.   Economic Rate of Return (ERR) The mission received an initial re-estimation of
the ERR for PLN's Java investment program during the project life. Subject to further
review of the data, it appears that the estimated ERR at project appraisal (18%) will be
achieved. Individual ERRs for the hydro renovation component were calculated and
ranged between 13% and 31% with an average of 24%, showing that the SAR estimates
(15% to 32%) have been met.
14.   Overall, the project performance vis-a-vis its objectives is satisfactory. However,
it should be noted that the project suffered from substantial delays in implementation (in
the order of one-and-a-half to three years) mainly due to lengthy procurement times.
These in turn were driven by the requirements imposed by both GOI and PLN
procurement procedures. Both these were significant contributing factors to the one-year
loan closing date extension. In addition, the project only partially achieved its policy
objectives in relation to the utilization of captive generation and energy price setting.
Project Sustainability and Operational Plan
15.   The project achievements and benefits are sustainable. The physical investments
will be productive for many years. In particular, the telecommunications program has
provided PLN with a state-of-the-art communications network which will provide
valuable services to the company for years to come. Results and recommendations from
the technical assistance have already been or are being incorporated into PLN's
management practices.



ICR Mission Aide Memoire           - 30 -                           Annex A
16.   Operational plans to ensure sustainability of the outcomes achieved under the
project were discussed with PLN during the mission, and are attached to this aide
memoire.
Disbursement.
17.   PLN  indicated that there were a small number of payments, valued at
approximately $1 million, which became, or would become, due after the loan closing
date of December 31, 1995. The mission advised PLN to prepare an application for a
transfer of these payments to an alternative loan.
Next Steps
18.   The mission's draft final ICR, reflecting the above findings, is expected to be sent
to GOI and PLN by May 1, 1996. It was agreed that PLN will forward its comments, if
any, to the Bank on the draft ICR by no later than May 15, 1996. The ICR will be
finalized and printed in June 1996.

OPERATIONAL PLAN
Diesel Power Plants
PLN has established comprehensively documented maintenance procedures for diesel
generation sets. These procedures for maintenance of diesel power plants have been
distributed to all regions where diesel generation sets have been installed.  The
procedures detail the type and frequency of maintenance to be provided and have an
established reporting system to monitor adherence to procedures. Reports are submitted
to operations division in the head office quarterly.  Maintenance is carried out in
accordance with manufacturers' specifications, a copy of which is held for each diesel
generation set.
Distribution Network
Maintenance on the distribution network in Java is managed by the four distribution
units. Patrols of lines take place on a regular basis and any deficiencies are noted and
corrected. In addition, a faults service is in place to provide rapid response to faults as
they occur. The maintenance and faults are conducted in accordance with the procedures
for quality, reliability and efficiency indicators of electric supply.
Hydro Power Plants
The completion report, being prepared by the consultant, will outline future operational
plan for the seven hydro power plants renovated under the project. Basically, all the
hydro plants are being operated on a 24-hour basis, depending on the availability of
water. Several indicators are used to measure the performance of these plants. Among
them are: energy capacity targets, plant factor and operating/maintenance cost (less or
within 0.5%-1% of the capital cost). Additional works have been identified by the
consultants for each of the seven plants for operational safety and reliability as well as for
improvement of efficiency. These works will be carried out according to their priority
order upon approval by the PLN Board.
Java West Operations Telecommunications System (JWOTS)
Design tools and guidelines have been developed by the consultants for operation,
maintenance and expansion of the system. Extensive training has been conducted by the



Operational Plan                   - 32 -                           Annex B
consultants and contractors which provided PLN staff with essential knowledge and skills
for system maintenance and design. The system has the capacity to support future growth
of PLN's power systems. In order to make better use of the system capacity, a joint use
program is being developed with PT Telkom. After a successful trial installation, PT
Telkom is now requesting further installations in Central Java and negotiations are now
underway. Furthermore, the system provides many types of data communications
interfaces linking all PLN sites and is suitable for the establishment of a wide area
network (WAN). Such a WAN is seen as a high priority by many PLN departments and
these interfaces are beginning to be used on a trial basis. A proposal is being developed
by PLN to establish a WAN.
Corporate and Financial Planning
A separate Corporate Planning Division has been established to institutionalize this
activity.
The new financial planning software, SIMUL, requires final customization. This will be
completed, and PLN's old software, FINPRO, will be converted to EXCEL to aid
compatibility. SIMUL will be maintained and updated as required. Training of staff
outside HQ will be undertaken so that financial projections can be made at the
responsibility center level. SIMUL's capacity to consolidate financial statements will be
utilized so that it remains useful in an unbundled PLN.
General Accounting
The manuals arising from the study will be updated as required by new events, for
example, the recent creation by PLN of two generating subsidiaries.
Distribution Management Program (DMP)
The DMP Master Plan, developed by the consultants under the project, identified 14
activities to be undertaken to improve PLN's distribution management. PLN established
in early 1994 a Working Group and a Steering Committee to carry out priority
implementation of three activities: customer information system, distribution information
system and data communications. Various pilots have been initiated and other follow-up
initiatives arising from the consultancy will be undertaken under the Bank financed
Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project.

POWER SECTOR EFFICIENCY PROJECT
(LOAN 3097-IND)
BORROWER'S EVALUATION REPORT
EVALUATION OF THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE
Bank's performance during the evolution and implementation of the project was generally
satisfactory. The efforts were very constructive during the process of project
implementation. Bank's involvement was steadily maintained throughout the project
circle. During the project preparation and appraisal, Bank had sent competent missions
so the scrutinizing process in establishing the project objective, and also in assessing of
the project cost, scope of work, financing plan and time schedule of the project could be
accomplished successfully. Bank has involved in establishing Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR) particularly in the assessment of cost planning, scope of work, source of finance,
time schedule, and delivered suggestions during cost revision and scope of work
negotiations. During the project implementation, Bank assisted PLN in supervision of
procurement, project time schedule, cost disbursement and PLN got some advice in
solving the pending issues prior to the date when the loan was nearly closed. Bank
extended the period of the loan by 1 year which reflected the mutual understanding
between the Bank and the Borrower (PLN).
EVALUATION OF THE BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE
During the project implementation, PLN has made its endeavor to improve the process.
However, delays occurred during the recruitment of Consultants and procurement
processes.
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BANK AND
THE BORROWER DURING THE EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE PROJECT
The relationship between the Bank and PLN was good. Most of the problems
encountered were clearly identified by both parties and relevant actions to solve the
problem were promptly agreed and taken.
In particular, good mutual understanding was achieved selecting least cost materials.



Borrower Evaluation                - 34 -                           Annex C
ASSESSMENT OF THE OUTCOME
The main objectives of the project were not only to focus the attention of PLN and GOI
on the sector's efficiency and to implement selected actions in a timely manner to utilize
resources more efficiently, but also to build PLN's institutional capacity in the fields of
corporate planning, financial planning, accounting and cash management functions, and
distribution management program.
With regards to the operational improvement, PLN rehabilitated 109 Diesel Plants with
total capacity 143 MW using the IBRD financing and relocated of 125 Diesel Plants with
total capacity of 65 MW. The project was developed and implemented new ways of
maintaining Diesel Units including improved inventory management for spare parts.
The project also renovated 22 units on 7 Hydro Electric Plants in Java with total capacity
gained of 25 MW.
In the field of telecommunications, the project  provided PLN  with a trunk
telecommunications network in West and Central Java using fiber optic cables which
superimposed on and integrated with PLN's existing telecommunications facilities.
To cope with the rapid demand growth, the project has complemented the earlier
transmission and substation network projects financed by the Bank with expanding non
rural distribution in the whole area of Java at voltages of 20 kV and below. The project
expanded distribution facilities in Java with 8.751 kmc MV lines, 9.744 kmc LV lines,
1.708 MVA distribution transformers and 1.011 . 153 new consumers. This distribution
project also included technical assistance to strengthen PLN's management of the
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of the distribution facilities.
On the institutional capacity building side, PLN's staff gained significant experience from
the technical assistance. As a result, the corporate and financial planning functions has
been strengthened and the cash management and accounting functions improved.
In summary, the project outcome can be rated satisfactory. The successful elements of
the Project should be used as reference for similar projects in future.
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
To maintain the agreed project schedule and to minimize implementation delays, it's very
important for PLN to improve it's internal procurement procedures.
The project was a very complex one with many independent components. A central
project management within Supervision Division of PLN could have facilitated the
overall project coordination and implementation.
