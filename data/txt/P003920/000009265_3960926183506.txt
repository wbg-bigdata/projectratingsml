MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
POWER SECTOR EFFICIENCY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$337.0 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance the Power Sector
Efficiency Project. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the State
Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years, including a grace period of five
years and the onlending rate would be equal to the Bank's standard variable
interest rate plus fees of 1.90Z. The Government will bear the foreigr.
exchange risk. The project is expected to be cofinanced by the Government of
the Netherlands for US$20 million equivalent with a combination of grants and
concessional funds. A financing gap of $67.6 million will be filled by other
cofinancing being arranged by the Government.
Background
2.       Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including oil,
natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal energy. Since the country
depends on oil for a major part of its exports, a major objective of the Gov-
ernment's energy policy has been to maintain the level of oil export earnings
by diversification of domestic energy consumption away from petroleum products
towards alternative fuels for wh'.ch there is a nonexportable surplus (coal and
natural gas) or which are nontradeable (hydropower and geothermal). The power
subsector is playing a central role in this respect.
3.       Indonesia's electric power subsector comprises:  (a) PLN, the State
Electricity Corporation; (b) captive plants installed by private parties,
mainly industries, for their own use; and (c) a small number of rural coopera-
tives set up to provide electricity in rural areas. The objectives of the
power subsector are to improve the welfare of the population and support the
growth of economic activity by meeting the electricity requirements of the
economy in an efficient and reliable manner. In pursuit of these objectives,
PLN's supply facilities have grown rapidly dur_.ag the past decade. Its
installed capacity increased by 2821, to 6,420 MV; its sales grew by 384Z, to
17,077 GWh; the number of consumers grew 4852, to 8.2 million. Despite this
rapid growth, the per capita electricity consumption in Indonesia in 1987/88
was only about 200 kWh, and only 241 of all households are electrified. This
level is much lower than that in the neighboring countries. The low level of
electricity consumption in Indonesia is primarily due to the lack of supply
facilities and access to the network for the residential and other sectors.
Given this situation, PLN's current targets for 1993/94 (end of the Fifth
Five-Year Plan) are to increase installed capacity to over 11,000 MV. This
would allow it to reach 351 of the population, as well as to supply about
three quarters of industrial electricity consumption.



-2-
Sector Strategy
4.       The Bank has supported the rapid expansion of Indonesia's power sec-
tor through the financing of 15 projects since 1969. These projects have
assisted PLN to expand in a least cost manner and diversify its sources of
fuels by introducing coal and geothermal plants, developing hydroelectric
potential, creating an integrated 500 kV grid on Java, extending distribution
facilities, reducing transmission and distribution losses, and enhancing its
institutional capacities, particularly its capability to carry out a rapid
expansion program. More recently, the Bank's support has focussed on develop-
ing PLN into a modern and efficient utility bys (a) strengthening technical
and corporate planning; (b) improving organization and management; (c) improv-
ing operating efficiency; and (d) developing human resources.
5.       At present, PLN is headed in the right direction in a number of
impor*ant ways: (a) in reducing its reliance on petroleum fuels in favor of
more economical fuels such as coal and natural gas; (b) in shifting its focus
beyond project implementation toward broader issues of system efficiency and
quality of service; (c) in moving towards reduced dependence on Government
funds and greater reliance on internal sources; and (d) in transforming itself
from a government agency into a modern, commercially oriented enterprise. The
Bank is closely involved in supporting the successful achievement of these
objectives.
6.       Under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND)
approved in January 1987, it was agreed that PLN's operations in Java would
achieve a rate of return of 81 in PY1988/89. Since the Government did not
permit tariff adjustments in 1988, this target was not achieved. However, on
March 27, 1989 an average increase of 252 in the electricity tariff was
announced by the Government, meeting the condition of the negotiations of the
proposed loan. As a result, PLN will achieve the agreed rate of return in
FY1989/90. The tariff level achieved after this adjustment is slightly above
the average long run marginal cost of supply and is sufficient to place PLN on
a sound financial footing. PLN's operations outside Java are expected to
reach a financial breakeven in FY1992/93 compared to the earlier target of
FY1990/91, as a result of measures including efficiency improvements that are
in progress and would be assisted by the proposed loan.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
7.       The rationale for Bank involvement arises not only from contributing
to the financing of Indonesia's massive power program to meet its development
needs but, more so, from contributing to institution development and effi-
ciency improvements in the sector. Past operations have emphasized different
aspects of the efficiency of the institution and the sector, such as imple-
menting the least cost investment program, improving the formulation and
implementation of projects, reducing system losses, etc. In an era of
resource constraints, drawing the greatest benefit possible from existing
assets has a high priority. The proposed project is designed to support a
time-slice of the distribution investment program, and to improve PLN's capa-
city to manage its existing and rapidly expanding system efficiently. The
policy actions that have been agreed under the proposed loan will enhance the
environment for efficiency improvements in the sector. Given its close rela-
tionship with and knowledge of the sector, the Bank is well placed to help the
authorities implement a program to enhance the managerial, operational, and
financial efficiency of the sector.



-3-
Project Obiectives
8.       The objectives of the project ares  (a) to focus the attention of PLN
and the Government on the sector's efficiency and to implement selected
actions in a time-bound manner to utilize resources more efficiently; (b) to
enhance the efficiency of the power sector by improving the operation of PLN's
diesel, hydro and steam power plants and distribution facilities; (c) to pro-
vide investment funds for augmentation of the distribution facilities and
PLN's telecommunications network; and (d) to improve corporate planning,
financial planning, accounting and cash management fur.ctions. Additionally,
to enhance the efficlency objectives, GOI and PLN have agreed to the folL,wing
policy measures:
(a)  to establish an institutional mechanism tc review, and advise the
Government on, the prices of such primary fuels as residual fuel oil,
diesel oil, coal and gas. An Interdepartmental Task Force, assisted
by an Energy Pricing Unit in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, will
be set up for this purpose;
(b) to establish an information system to separate the costs for the
rural electrification component of PLN's investments and operations,
as a first step towards the clarification of responsibility for the
financing of the investment program between GOI and PLN; and
(c) to introduce suitable regulatory and contractual measures to utilize
some of the private (in-house) generating capacity along with PLN's
facilities, to reduce investment costs and to promote cogeneration by
industries.
Proiect Description
9.       The project comprises investment and technical assistance components.
The investment components will include: (a) improvement in the efficiency of
operations of diesel power plants, including their relocation and rehabilita-
tion; (b) renovation of small hydro plants in Java to extend their life and
recover derated capacity; (c) extension of distribution facilities to supply
about 893,000 new customers in Java in 1990191 and 1991192; and (d) augmenta-
tion of PLN's telecommunications facilities in Java. The technical assistance
components will include assistance, inter alia, for improving: (a) operation
of diesel power plants; (b) operation and maintenance of steam power plants;
(c) operation, maintenance and management of distribution facilities;
(d) general accounting and cash management; and (e) financial planning and
corporate planning functions. Included as well will be the training of PLN's
staff in the above areas. The Bank loan will finance equipment and materials,
consulting services and technical assistance. The total financing requirement
for the project is estimated at US$597.0 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$465.1 million (77.9?). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps
are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7122-IND, dated May 25,
1989, is being distributed separately.



-4-
Actions Agreed
10.      In addition to the agreements mentioned in para. 8, PLY agreed to
(a) review annually with the Bank its plan for distribution expansion in Java,
commencing March 31, 19901 and (b) submit for the Bank's approval reports con-
taining evaluation and justification of diesel plants selected for rehabilita-
tion. The following agreements, which ars the same in substance as those
under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND), are
also included in this projects (a) realization of an annual rate of return of
not less than 8S on PLN's revalued average net fixed assetu  a operation in
Java in PY 1989/9- and thereafter (a shift of one year from =ne target year of
FY 1988/89 that was agreed under Loan 2778-IND)s (b) achievement of financial
breakeven for PLN's non-Java operations in FY 1992193 (a shift of two years
from the target year of PY 1990/91 that was agreed under Loan 2778-IND)s
(c) annual review of PLN's development plans and investment programs
(d) Implementation of an action plan for efficiency improvements5 (e) mainte-
nance of the overdue accounts of the Government users to within two months'
billingt (f) review of financing plans for PLN's investment program;
(g) annual review of the tariff level and structure; and (h) limitation of
debt and audit of accounts.
Benefits
11.      Various actions for improving the efficiency would be reflected in
the performance indicators of PLN. Internal economic rates of return (EMR)
for the investment components aret for the hydro renovation component,
between 151 and 321; for PLN's investment program In Java, wich Includes the
proposed investment in distribution, 18S--it will be 91 if only the revenue at
the prevailing tariff is taken as benefit and consumer surplus is ignored; and
for the diesel efficiency component, over 151.
Risks
12.      There are no major risks associated with the various components of
the proposed project. One possible risk is that the implementation of some of
the components may be delayed compared to the proposed schedules. However,
PLN has already initiated action to appoint consultants and establish project
implementation units to minimize the possibility of delays. Speclal attention
will be devoted to timely completion of procurement activities.
Recommendation
13.      I em satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
