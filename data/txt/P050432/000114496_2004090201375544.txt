as hereinafter provided;
      NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

For the purpose of this Section:
             (i)  “Interest Period” means the initial period from and
                  including the date of this Agreement to, but excluding, the
                  first Interest Payment Date occurring thereafter and, after
                  the initial period, each period from and including an
                  Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next following
                  Interest Payment date.

                  2.06 of this Agreement.
           (iii)  “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, the
                  London interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in
                  Dollars for value the first day of such Interest Period (or,
                  in the case of the initial Period, for value the Interest
                  Payment Date occurring on or next preceding the first day of
                  such Interest Period), as reasonably determined by the Bank
                  and expressed as a percentage per annum.
            (iv)  “LIBOR  Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A)
                  one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the
                  weighted average margin, for such Interest Period, below (or
                  above) the London interbank offered rates, or other
                  reference rates, for six-month deposits, in respect of the 
                  Bank’s outstanding borrowings or portions thereof allocated 
                  by the Bank to fund single currency loans or portions 
                  thereof made by it that include the Loan; as reasonably

provided in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest 
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower
