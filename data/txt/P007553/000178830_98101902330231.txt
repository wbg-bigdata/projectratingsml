INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A RIO FUERTE/RIO SINALOA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nacional Financiera, S.A. with the guarantee of United Mexican States for
the equivalent of US$92 million to help finance a Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa
Irrigation Project. The loan would be repaid over 17 years, including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        Some of the major features of the Mexican economy were analyzed in
"An Updating Report on the Economy of Mexico" (1110-ME), distributed to the
Executive Directors on March 23, 1976. A special economic mission visited
Mexico in April-May 1977. Its report has been discussed with the Mexican
authorities and is about to be circulated to the Executive Directors. The
discussion which follows reflects the principal and updated findings of the
mission.
Past Performance
3.        For most of the three decades preceding the mid-seventies, Mexico
was outstandingly successful in achieving rapid economic growth while main-
taining stability in prices and the balance of payments. From 1940 to 1970,
average GDP growth exceeded 6 percent per year in real terms, inflation
averaged less than 5 percent per year from the mid-1960s to 1972, and the
dollar value of the peso, fixed in 1954, was maintained until the September
1976 devaluation. The Government's role in this achievement was to carry
out direct investments in infrastructure and in key industries such as power,
steel and petroleum, while creating a stable regulatory and institutional
framework, as well as good profit prospects, to induce private sector growth.
4.        This strategy produced rapid growth, but did little to reduce
contrasts within the Mexican economy. While land redistribution under the
reform of 1915 was continued, most of the peasants who received land could
not improve their economic status as they could not benefit from basic
infrastructure, credit and technical assistance. Rapid population growth
made social equity even more difficult to achieve. Population growth in
Mexico accelerated steadily, primarily as a result of reduced death rates,
and reached 3.4 percent per year by 1970. Despite economic growth, the high
demographic growth rate made adequate absorption of the labor force in
productive employment difficult. Some 40 percent of the labor force is
either relatively unproductive and poorly paid, or openly unemployed.
1/   Part I is substantially unchanged from the President's Report for a
Second Fertilizer Project (R79-68) of March 30, 1979.



-2-
5.        During the 1970s, Mexico experienced increasing public sector
deficits, inflation, large balance of payments deficits, capital flight
and a marked slowdown in the real rate of growth of GDP, which dropped to
less than 2 percent in 1976--the lowest annual growth rate experienced by
Mexico since the mid-thirties. On September 1, 1976 the authorities
abandoned the fixed exchange rate of 12.50 pesos per dollar that had remained
unchanged since 1954 and let the peso float; in recent months it has remained
rather stable at rates fluctuating around 22.60 pesos per dollar. Following
the devaluation, Mexico obtained major support from the IMF. In the last
quarter of 1976, Mexico was able to draw on the Fund for US$480 million. For
1977-79, an Extended Fund Facility accompanied by a comprehensive three-year
stabilization program was negotiated. The new Government ratified the agree-
aent with the IMF shortly after taking office on December 1, 1976, and to
date has complied with the program agreed upon with the IMF.
Current Economic Policy
15.       The present Government inherited a difficult situation.  High
inflation, large public sector deficits, increasing foreign indebtedness and
lack of confidence in economic management indicated a need for economic
stabilization. However, the situation also called for more expansionary
policies; economic activity had slowed down, net private investment was
virtually nil, and the gap between new job creation and growth of the labor
force was increasing. High world prices for petroleum offered profitable
investment opportunities in the petroleum sector; indeed, increased production
for export of these products seemed by far the best way to meet a large part
of Mexico's high debt service requirements in the coming years.
7.        Faced with these conflicting needs and opportunities, the Mexican
authorities have adopted a mixed strategy aimed at reducing lower-priority
public expenditures and increasing public revenues, while proceeding with
petroleum and other high-priority investments. The objectives of the Govern-
ment's program include control of inflation together with a return to high
rates of economic growth. Better management of public sector expenditures,
more rational pricing and cost control in public sector enterprises, promotion
of private savings, limiting wage increases to justifiable levels, and more
effective cooperation with the private sector are important parts of the
Government's economic strategy.
8.        The measures instituted by the current Administration have produced
good results. Inflation was brought back to 18 percent in 1978, down from an
annual rate of more than 60 percent in the last quarter of 1976, immediately
after the devaluation. The deficit in the current account of the balance of
payments peaked at $4.2 billion in 1975 and declined to $2.0 billion in 1977.
The favorable oil prospects and increasing capital inflows allowed it to
increase again and it is estimated to have been $3.1 billion in 1978. Public
sector net deficit also peaked at 8.6 percent of GDY in 1975 and declined to
5.4 percent of GDY in 1978. Mobilization of savings by the banking system has
also been recovering at a strong pace. The GDP rate of growth is estimated at
6.5 percent in 1978 as compared to less than 1 percent in 1977. The outlook
for 1979 is favorable; the rate of growth of the economy should increase while



- 3 -
efforts to control the rate of inflation will have to be continued; the
deficit in the current account of the balance of payments and the public
sector's financial requirements are likely to remain at the 1978 levels in
real terms.
Economic Issues and Prospects
9.        A comprehensive social program is gradually emerging.  It is
aimed at strengthening the political system, improving income distribu-
tion and the living conditions of the poor, increasing public sector
efficiency and accelerating growth. The program takes into account two
overriding economic priorities--energy development and adequate supplies
of foodstuffs--and takes the form of a three stage economic strategy. The
first stage--the stabilization period--was devoted to overcome the serious
economic problems the present Government inherited. The second stage will be
devoted to establishing the basis for attaining a high, equitable and stable
rate of growth. During this stage--1979-80--efforts will be made to overcome
supply bottlenecks, increase agricultural production, improve the marketing
system, increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the country's indus-
trial sector and create the conditions necessary for a more just distribution
of the benefits of growth. Accelerated and equitable growth would be the
characteristics of the third stage.
10.       Mexico has the human, institutional and natural resources necessary
to attain these ambitious goals. The short-run disequilibria that have
affected the country during the mid-70s have been brought under control;
the new petroleum riches and the country's ability to exploit them have
greatly relaxed the financial constraints on growth. In his last State of the
Union speech President Lopez Portillo announced that Mexico's present oil and
gas reserves amounted to 20 billion barrels on July 31, 1978 and that probable
and potential reserves amounted to 37 billion and 120 billion barrels, respec-
tively. These figures were revised upward in January 1979 and proven oil and
gas reserves put at about 40 billion barrels. Exploitation of these reserves
should allow Mexico to increase production of crude oil, natural gas and
petrochemicals from the equivalent of about 1.2 million bbl/day in 1976 to
about 3.3 million bbl/day in 1982 and export earnings are projected to rise
from about US$600 million in 1976 to approximately US$11 billion in 1982 (on
the basis of very conservative price assumptions), not counting potential gas
exports.
11.       The challenge ahead is how to use these vast riches to help resolve
Mexico's long-term development problems which include the following:
(i) Population and Poverty. Many Mexican families have not partici-
pated in the sustained economic growth of the last several decades.
As of 1975, about 3.6 million Mexican families--35 percent of the
total--receive incomes less than one-half the national average. The
members of most of these families work--more than half of them in
agriculture--but they produce little and receive little. Mexico's
labor force is now growing at about 3.1 percent per year; during the
1960s this growth rate was 2.0 percent per year. The challenge of
providing productive jobs for both new entrants and existing under-
productive workers is awesome;



-4-
(ii) Stagnation in Agriculture. Crop and livestock production
in Mexico, which had grown by 6 percent per year during
1945-55 and 4.2 percent per year during 1955-65, grew at
only 2.1 percent per year during 1965-75, resulting in
increased imports of corn and wheat;
(iii) Regional Imbalances. The heavy concentration of people,
production, and public services in the Mexico City area--
which has currently a population of about 12 million and
is growing at over 5 percent each year--and the scarcity
of productive employment and services for rural Mexicans
are challenges to urban management, economic development,
and social justice. They imply diversion of some of Mexico
City's future growth to other regions, as well as the
gradual concentration of scattered rural populations into
small towns so that basic public services could be provided
more economically and productive activities would have a
better chance of developing.
12.       In the medium term the prospects for resumption of economic growth
with relative price stability are good. Poverty will remain a problem but
the Government is taking steps to address it. The alleviation of the external
constraint on growth brought about by the expected petroleum earnings (para.
15), together with the Government's efforts to increase public sector savings
and to stimulate private investment, could produce economic growth of 7 to 8
percent per year in the remaining four years of the present administration.
Resumption of economic growth combined with the intensification of the Govern-
ment's family planning program, 1/ the new emphasis on rainfed agriculture,
and the implementation of specific programs aimed at increasing productive
employment, should help to address the structural problems mentioned above.
13.       In agriculture, the current administration has undertaken a far-
reaching administrative reform that will allow broader and more effective
Government action in the sector. Emphasis is laid on productivity gains
and yield increases in both irrigated and rainfed areas. The previous goal
of self-sufficiency ia agricultural goods is being rephrased in terms of
the sector's overall capacity to pay for its own imports. Irrigation is
fostered through programs for construction of irrigation and drainage works
and for rehabilitation of existing irrigation districts to increase efficiency
of water use. The new emphasis on rainfed agriculture, relatively neglected
in the past, should lead to an increase in the productive potential of vast
areas currently under-exploited and to a reversal of past trends towards
1/   On October 28, 1977, President Lopez Portillo announced the ambitious
goal of reducing the population growth to 2.5 percent per year by 1982,
then progressively to 1.8 percent by 1988, 1.3 percent by 1994, and
1 percent by the year 2000. About two-thirds of Mexico's population
live in urban areas, well served by hospitals and health centers, with
good family planning education and services. The program is now being
extended to rural areas.



-5-
larger income disparities between the modern and traditional agricultural
subsectors. These initiatives, together with the realistic exchange rate,
promise a resumption of production growth for both domestic and export
markets and an improvement in the living conditions of the rural poor.
14.       Industry has potential for considerable growth in many sectors,
including import substitution in chemicals, petrochemicals and capital goods
as well as exports of many different manufactured products. The Mexican
Petroleum Company (PEMEX) has already started an ambitious investment program
to produce a variety of primary petrochemicals on a large scale for both
domestic consumption and export, and it is expected that the private sector
will complement this by investing in the production of secondary petrochemicals.
Tourism export earnings are also expected to increase.
15.       Paramount among the benefits of recent public sector investments
are the new possibilities opened to the Mexican economy through the dis-
coveries of rich petroleum fields. The Government has decided to use these
large hydrocarbon resources to help manage Mexico's heavy debt service
burden and to enhance the country's development prospects. The additional
domestic demand likely to occur, due to increased public investment and
programs aimed at increasing employment and the productivity of the poor,
will have to be satisfied partially through increased imports. The import
capacity will be increased considerably, however. Rapidly increasing
petroleum exports and favorable tourism earnings prospects, the recovery of
agricultural exports and resumption of growth of manufactured exports have
strengthened the balance of payments outlook and will keep the current
account deficit at reasonable levels despite higher imports.
16.       Mexico's public debt service ratio has been increasing over the
recent past and reached 48 percent in 1977. This comparatively high ratio is
more a reflection of the low level of exports relative to GNP and the high
proportion of Mexican borrowing from commercial banks than it is an indication
of a high level of external debt relative to the size of the economy. When
middle income developing countries are ranked by the ratio of external public
debt to GNP, Mexico ranks as average. The public debt service ratio is
estimated to have peaked above 50 percent in 1978 and, mainly as a result of
the rapid expansion of petroleum exports, is expected to decline to levels of
around 40 percent in the early 1980's. Debt service on Bank loans amounts to
about 4.3 percent of public debt service; this ratio is projected to decrease
over the next years to some 3.6 percent in 1982. The Bank currently holds
about 7 percent of Mexico's total medium- and long-term public debt, and this
ratio is not likely to change in any significant way over the next few years.
Mexico remains creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms considering
the country's excellent medium- and long-term potential and the well conceived
economic strategy which the Government has adopted to realize it.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO 1/
Bank Operations
17.       As of March 31, 1979, Mexico had received 57 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$3,128.9 million net of cancellations and terminations; of
these, 33 loans totalling US$1,486.4 million were fully disbursed. The Bank
held US$2,595.3 million of which US$1,086.2 million had not yet been disbursed.
Some 40 percent of Bank lending has been for agriculture and rural development
(19 loans for US$1,264.4 million), 23 percent CTor power (12 loans for US$704.8
million) and 17 percent for transportation projects (12 loans for US$546.7
million); the remaining 20 percent has been for industry (US$352.5 million),
water supply (US$130 million), tourism (US$114 million), and urban development
(US$16.5 million) projects. Mexico was carrying out a stabilization program
(para. 9), and because of scarcity of counterpart funds some projects fell behind
schedule in 1976 and 1977. Adequate budget support for Bank projects has now
been secured. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of
March 31, 1979 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
IFC Operations
18.       As of March 31, 1979, IFC has made investment commitments in
17 companies in Mexico, for a total of US$202.4 million, of which US$130.5
million had been sold, repaid or cancelled. The balance held by the
Corporation, US$71.9 million, consists of US$62.1 million in loans and US$9.8
million in equity. A summary statement of IFC investments as of March 31,
1979, is presented in Annex II.
Bank Strategy
19.       The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico have been to:
(i) support policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the
benefits of economic growth; (ii) help finance projects that make directly or
indirectly, significant corntributions to output, exports, and employment; and
(iii) help resolve critical adjustment problems that Mexico is currently
facing. The Bank is preferentially supporting projects of high social priority
that help the rural or urban poor, projects that promote higher levels of
employment and production and those that help to decentralize economic activity.
20.       Because of the difficult structural problems of Mexico's agricul-
ture and the sector's crucial importance to the country's further development,
the Bank has made agriculture the leading sector for its lending.  The Bank
agricultural lending program for Mexico has four goals: first, to increase
productivity of presently cultivated lands through selected programs of irr*-
gation rehabilitation and on-farm improvements; second, to improve the pro-
ductivity of small farmers who receive the benefit of most Bank lending through
programs for (a) rural development, (b) rainfed agricultural development,
1/   Part II is substantially unchanged from the President's Report for a
Second Fertilizer Project (R79-68) of March 30, 1979.



- 7 -
(c) bringing new areas under cultivation, and (d) establishing irrigation and
drainage units; third, to complement infrastructure investments with general
support services including agricultural extension and marketing programs and
provision of mediuin-term credit; and fourth, to promote of-Faacm employment
opportunities in rural areas through programs of agro- and rural-industries.
The proposed project would support several of these goals; it would rehabilitate
inadequate infrastructure and reclaim soils that have lost their productivity.
The project would open new lands to intensive cultivation under irrigation.
In addition, the project would support expansion and improvementts Li 'it
pcogram of technical assistance that were beguni under a previous project.
The Bank has made nine loans in FY 72 through 78, totalling US$835 million,
for irrigation, rural developfent and agriculture and livestock credit programs.
A US$25 million supplemental loan for the Rio Panuco Irrigation Project and
US$60 million loan for a small-scale agricultural infrastructure project
were approved by the Executive Directors in FY79. Projects for rehabilitation
of irrigation districts, water control, rural development and support services
are in preparation for possible future support from the Bank.
21.       Past Bank lending for industry has been aimed at (a) assisting the
Government's efforts to reduce the balance of payments deficit, (b) decentral-
izing industrial activities away from the major and increasingly congested
urban areas, and (c) promoting greater employment in the sector by suppocting
medium and small scale industry. A large steel project is now operating in
a previously underdeveloped area on the west coast of Mexico. A fertilizer
project strengthens development of the resource-rich southeast region and the
central area and a US$80 million loan for a fertilizer project approved by the
Executive Directors in FY79 gives further support to the development oF an
Lndustrial center on the west coast of Mexico. A. project to promote the
development of small- and medium-scale enterprises and a third industrial
equipment fund project were approved by the Executive Direct:ors iFi FY78; both
offer support to the private sector at a time of rapid expansion. A fourth
industrial equipment loan is under subriss[ori to the Executive Directors. A
capital goods industry project which would relieve bottlenecks in the subsector
is under study for possible Bank support.
22.       As regards infrastructure, the Bank's operations have been focused
on investments in key areas of the country as well as on Li,slilutional reforms
and sector policies aiming, inter alia, at suitable pricing mechanisms to
help generate addittonal resources for investment financing.  The aL[pocts
development project (FY74) was designed to support the Government's policy
of regional integration; the third railway project (FY76) supported improve-
ments of institutional aspects and financial management of the sector. The
Mexico City (FY73) and medium cities (FY76) water supply projects naviva
LaStrumental in the establishment of specialized institutions for efficient
provisLon ofT drinking water and in the pricing of water at  m.fnls nore closely
related to costs. A highway sector project loan was approved by the
Executive Directors in FY79. A second airports project is being processed.
23.       The Government and the Bank have long recognized the regional
economic disparities prevailing in Mexico (para. 11).  In June 1976 thie
Government adopted the Law of Human Settlements to provide a new institutional
framework to deal with the pressing problems of over-concentration of economeic



activities in the larger metropolitan areas. The Government has recently
adopted a National Urban Development Plan that spells out its regional devel-
opment priorities in operational terms, and several projects are now being
prepared to laeet tihe needs for basic urban services for poor fainilies and to
provide key regional infrastructure in selected priority cities. One such
project, to assist in the development of the Lazaro Cardenas conurbation area
on the West Coast, was approved by the Executive Directors in FY78, and another
!r)Jet Ec;)c the southeast part of the country will be appraised in the coming
months.
24.       The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is the second largest
source of multilateral aid to Mexico. The IDB has made loans totaling
US$1,830 million.  Over sixty percent of this lending has gone for agricul-
tural and rural development projects, and the balance for transportation,
industry, and tourism infrastructure. In 1978, the IDB approved three loans
totaling US$236 million for coal mining, irrigation, and tourism projects.
The IDB and the Bank have worked in parallel on several projects; most recently
the IDB and the Bank have each made loans for the National Program for Small-
Scale Agricultural Infrastructure, the Investment Program for Rural Develop-
ment (PIDER), agricultural and livestock credit, small- and medium-scale
industries, and hotel development. The International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) is also considering a rural development project in the
state of Oaxaca; Bank staff is assisting in project preparation and appraisal.
PART III - TPE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Background
25.       The agricultural sector provides the livelihood for a rural pop;tla-
tion of some 4 million families scattered over 95,000 villages. Unemployment
and under-employment are major problems in the agricultural sector. With a
cropped area Fluctuating around 15 million ha, there is a heavy concentration
of population iL comparison to cropped area.  This is one of the major causes
determining the level of income in the agricultural sector, which is lower
than that of other sectorsz

Industry and Services             504             420
26.       During the period 1945-1955, agricultural output grew at a rate
of 6 percent per annum; most of the rapid increase in production came from
opening nei.rly 110,000 ha per annum to intensive irrigated cultivation.
Irrigation has played a central role in Mexico's agricultural development
plans; rainfall over much of Mexico's best lands is either erratic or too



- 9 -
sparse to allow economic use of modern farm technologies. Irrigation has
helped spur production, and it has also been a powerful means of income
redistribution. Because land holdings in all new irrigation districts are
strictly limited by Mexican law, eiidos 1/ have been established on most
land in new irrigation districts thereby providing productive irrigated lands
to families who formerly were either landless or had rights to uneconomic
holdings.
27.       The rate of increase of crop and livestock production declined,
however, to 4.2 percent per annum during 1955-1965 and to 2.1 percent per
annum during 1965-1975. In large part, this trend toward stagnation is
the effect of a decline in the rate of expansion of irrigated and culti-
vated areas. Between 1945 and 1955, irrigated area expanded rapidly at
the rate of about 110,000 ha per annum. However, this increase dropped
sharply after 1955; an average of 65,000 ha per annum of irrigated
lands were brought under cultivation between 1955 and 1975 as projects
became more expensive due to increasing technical difficulty. Overall,
the rate of growth of cultivated area was nearly 3 percent per annum
between 1945 and 1965, but since 1965, cropped area has been constant
at around 15 million ha.
Government's Policies and Programs
28.       The agricultural policy of the Mexican Government has in recent
years focused on increasing production of basic food crops (maize, wheat and
rice) and on raising incomes and living standards for the pooret sections of
the rural population. The Government's strategy for increasing agricultural
production includes measures to increase the cropped area and to increase the
productivity of lands currently being cropped.
29.       Several programs for the development of both irrigated and rainfed
agriculture will bring new lands into production. The Government's goal is
to double the cultivated area (an increase of 15 million ha) by the end of
this century. To meet this goal, an additional 5 million ha would be brought
under irrigation through new schemes and expansion of existing systems.
Expansion of drainage systems, development of new farm technologies, and a
program of economic incentives would increase rainfed lands under cultiva-
tion by nearly 10 million ha. A substantial portion of the increase in rain-
fed lands would take place in the tropics of Mexico; the Bank is assisting
the pilot Tropical Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1553-ME) which will
develop and prove the technology for intensive agricultural development of
the zone.
30.       The present administration is placing emphasis on programs to
increase farm productivity. A program to rehabilitate those irrigation
districts where infrastructure is inadequate or where lands are in poor
1/   An ejido is a form of group land tenure based on usufruct; its members
are called ejidatarios.



- 10 -
condition has been expanded with important financial support from the Mexican
banking community and the participating farmers. Increasing attention is
being given to development of the potential of rainfed agriculture. The 110
recently established rainfed agricultural districts would promote the adoption
of modern technology and would be the basis for strengthening the delivery of
technical assistance and marketing services to farmers. Such programs are
complemented by other public investments to improve the incomes and employment
levels of the rural poor. The most important of these is the national Invest-
ment Program for Rural Development (PIDER) which provides a balanced package
of directly productive, support, and social infrastructure to residents of
Mexico's poorest rural zones.
31.       Thus, the Government's agricultural development strategy is to provide
access to modern farming techniques for a higher proportion of its rural popula-
tion. The strategy calls for investments by the Government in education, applied
research and extension as well as in physical infrastructure for irrigation,
drainage, access roads, land clearing, and marketing and storage facilities.
At the same time, the Government would stimulate private investment through
the credit institutions. The Bank is supporting the Government's strategy in
both these areas. Four projects approved by the Executive Directors in FY78
and FY79 finance part of the Government's program to expand intensive irrigated
and rainfed agriculture. The sixth agricultural credit project, approved by
the Executive Directors in FY78, supports private investment in agriculture
and agroindustries. The proposed project would continue Bank support of the
Government strategy by providing infrastructure and technology necessary for
nearly 20,000 farmers to significantly increase their productivity.
Experience in Previous Projects
32.       Implementation of Bank-financed projects has generally been satis-
factory. Because of a shortage of counterpart funds and the necessity for
the Government to carry out a stabilization program, implementation of three
irrigation projects fell behind schedule. The scope of one project--the Bajo
Rio Bravo-Bajo Rio San Juan project--was significantly reduced (R77-305 dated
December 13, 1978). The two other projects, the Rio Panuco and Rio Sinaloa
irrigation projects, had been appraised prior to the rapid inflation of the
mid-1970s. The compound effect of higher than anticipated inflation and
delays necessitated by fiscal stringency was to nearly double the cost of each
project. To ameliorate the effects of these cost increases during a period of
recovery, a US$25 million supplemental loan for the Rio Panuco project was
approved by the Executive Directors last year (R78-164 dated June 27, 1978),
and the scope of the Rio Sinaloa project was reduced (R79-51 dated March 13,
1979). Adequate budgetary allocations are now being made for these projects,
and execution is proceeding satisfactorily in accordance with the revised
plans.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa Irrigation
Project," No. 2454-ME, dated May 7, 1979 is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. The project was prepared by SARH and was appraised



- 11 -
by a Bank mission in September 1978. Negotiations took place in Washington,
D.C. on April 30 through May 2, 1979. The Mexican negotiating team was led by
Mr. Pedro Galicia.
Project Description
34.       The proposed project would increase the productivity of 196,000 ha
of farm lands through: (a) reclamation of 60,000 ha of saline lands, and
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure serving another 60,000 ha in the
Rio Fuerte Irrigation District; and (b) construction and rehabilitation of
irrigation and drainage infrastructure benefitting 76,000 ha in the Rio Sinaloa
Irrigation District (Map IBRD 13953R). Infrastructure works would be comple-
mented by a program of intensive technical assistance and applied agricultural
research benefitting farmers in both districts.
35.       The Rio Fuerte Irrigation District covers a total area of 210,000
ha. The district is irrigated by gravity canals that lead from the Rio Fuerte
which is regulated by the Miguel Hidalgo Dam. In addition, transfers of water
from the adjoining Rio Sinaloa Irrigation District can be used to augment the
water supplied from the Rio Fuerte. In its first loan to Mexico for irrigation
development (Loan 275-ME in 1961), the Bank assisted in the successful reclama-
tion of saline lands in two of the five units in the Fuerte district totalling
about 77,000 ha. Since the completion of the first project, an additional
60,000 ha have become salinized due to poor drainage. The proposed project
would include reclamation of these lands and improvement of the irrigation
infrastructure serving an additional 60,000 ha not benefitted under the
previous project.
36.       The Rio Sinaloa Irrigation District covers at the present time
54,000 ha that are potentially irrigable by wells and diversion from the
unregulated flow of the Rio Sinaloa. The area actually irrigated in any
given year fluctuates with the available water supply and is considerably
less than the total potential area. The ongoing Rio Sinaloa irrigation
project (Loan 970-ME of March 1, 1974) will establish a storage dam on the
Rio Sinaloa at Bacurato, a diversion dam downstream, irrigation and drainage
infrastructure serving 29,000 ha, and main irrigation canals to supply
water through the existing secondary network to 16,000 ha. The 105,000 ha
of potentially irrigable land of the Rio Sinaloa district was orriginally
to have been developed under the Sinaloa project, but the area was subse-
quently reduced in the modified project (R79-51 dated March 13, 1979 refers).
The Bacurato dam, under construction, will be capable of supplying suffi-
cient water to irrigate the full 105,000 ha. Under the proposed project,
the surplus water available from Bacurato would be used to leach accumulated
salts from about 60,000 ha of soils in the Fuerte district. The Fuerte
district will use the full excess capacity of the Bacurato Reservoir until
1984 when the completion of the leaching program and reduction of water
losses will provide a surplus capacity to expand the irrigated area of the
Sinaloa district. The proposed project, therefore, includes construction
of irrigation and drainage infrastructure to serve the remaining potentially
irrigable area of 76,000 ha in the Rio Sinaloa Irrigation District.



- 12 -
37.       In addition to construction of irrigation canals, drains, and
feeder roads within the two irrigation districts, the project includes a
telephone system to link operating headquarters of the districts with the
Bacurato control room, construction of houses for ditch riders, purchase
of equipment necessary for operation and maintenance of the districts,
expansion of the groundwater observation well network, and a program of
technical assistance and applied research including studies on drainage
problems and potential expansion of irrigated area.
Technical Services
38.       Agricultural extension services in the established irrigation dis-
tricts have been satisfactory. The Government has taken action to strengthen
these services under the ongoing Rio Sinaloa irrigation project, the latest
of which is the establishment of the District Integrated Technical Assistance
Program (DITA), which is among the best technical assistance programs in
Mexico. The proposed project would support expansion of DITA programs in both
districts. DITA provides agricultural extension and water management advice
using procedures similar to the training and visit system which has been
supported in a number of Bank-financed projects. At the farm level, extension
activities are handled by separate teams assigned to specific areas. A field
extension officer at the professional level is assigned to an area of about
3,000 ha, with responsibility for about 300 to 500 families. Depending on the
work load, the field extension officer may be assisted by an agricultural
technician. Farm visits are made on a regular basis in a cycle of 10 to 14
days. At each visit the extension officer gives written recommendations to
the farmer or ejido management, keeping a copy for his own records. Field
extension officers meetings are held at weekly intervals at either the zone
or area levels. Meetings are also held at intervals of 2-3 weeks at the unit
or district level for more formal training and technical discussions.
39.       Field technicians are supported by special units (e.g. hydrology,
deep wells, water use, applied research); each unit has subject matter
specialists who work closely with the field extension workers. Of particular
importance is the unit for applied research which conducts selected farm
trials which serve to orient the field extension officers and to facilitate
farmer demonstrations. Applied research is largely conducted at the Northwest-
ern Agricultural Research Center located near Los Mochis. Research is well
conducted and relevant to farmers' needs. However, insufficient funding has
prevented expansion of the farm demonstration and field trial program to the
desired level.
40.       The total cost of technical services under the project (including
contingencies) is estimated at US$22.4 million, of which US$2.6 million would
be in foreign exchange. With a view to making a meaningful contribution to
this critical element of the project, it is proposed that the Bank finance
not only the foreign exchange component but also US$7.4 million equivalent
of local costs of extension services, investigation and applied research.



- 13 -
Monitoring and Evaluation
41.       Monitoring and evaluation is routinely conducted by staff of each
irrigation district as a part of their program of operations. Basic data,
the most important of which are cropped areas, cropping patterns, water use,
yields, prices, operation and maintenance activities, extension activities,
ground water levels, progress of works and reservoir storage are collected and
used in the management of the districts.
Project Management
42.       The project would be implemented by SARH through its ordinary
channels. The Office of Major Infrastructure Programs in Northern Sinaloa
would have lead responsibility for project execution. Within the office,
specific teams manage project planning, design, and construction phases.
These teams are supported by specialist staff of SARH from the state and
national headquarters. Responsibility for operation, maintenance, and
administration of completed works rests with each chief of an irrigation
district. The chief is head of an executive committee consisting of farmer
representatives and technical staff from related government agencies. The
heads of Infrastructure Programs and of each irrigation district report to
the State Representative of SARH. This mechanism promotes delegation of
responsibility to the field level while allowing appropriate central manage-
ment. Management under the ongoing Rio Sinaloa irrigation project has been
satisfactory and is considered suitable for the proposed project.
Project Cost and Finance
43.       The project is expected to cost US$249.7 million, of which US$84.6
million would be foreign exchange. The US$92 million Bank loan would finance
37 percent of total project costs, i.e., the foreign exchange costs and
US$7.4 million of local costs for incremental technical assistance services,
applied research and studies. The balance would be financed by the Government
(63 percent).
Cost Recovery
44.       Project costs would be recovered through a combination of water
charges, income taxes and production taxes. While previously water charges
were set at low levels and large subsidies were provided to irrigation dis-
tricts, the present administration has moved to increase water rates and
make the districts self-sustaining. The Government's policy is to recover
the full cost of operation and maintenance through volumetric water charges
and, in addition, to recover a portion of investment costs through levies.
The portion of investment costs directly recovered is set after completion of
a socio-economic study of the district to determine the beneficiaries' capacity
to pay. This study is normally conducted after the district begins to supply
water to the fields; thus, there is greater certainty regarding the ability of
beneficiary farmers to pay and of the investment cost of project works. The
portion of capital investment recovered in this fashion is limited by Mexican
law to 30 percent. Additional amounts would be raised from taxes; about
US$3.1 million annually of incremental income taxes are expected to be
generated by the project.



- 14 -
45.       Assurances have been obtained that the Government will collect
water charges to recover: (a) the full cost of operation and maintenance;
and (b) that portion of capital costs as shall be determined to be reasonable
in light of the beneficiaries' capacity to pay and the need to make efficient
use of the water provided to them. The portion of capital cost to be recovered
would be determined after review of a study to be submitted to the Bank by
December 1, 1984. The study would be periodically updated and water rates
appropriately revised (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.08). The study is
expected to borrow heavily from experience under the ongoing Rio Sinaloa
irrigation project, for which a similar study is expected to be completed in
early 1980.
Procurement
46.       Contracts for major civil works would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. To
encourage competition, works would be grouped where possible into contracts
with a value of at least US$2 million. Contracts for smaller civil works
for which international competitive bidding would not be efficient would be
let under the Guarantor's ordinary procedures. Such contracts would include
on-farm works, such as smoothing of land, for which farmers are expected
to form partnerships. This work provides income to the farmers pending
completion of the works, but more importantly, it trains them in proper level-
ing procedures and prepares them to maintain their fields in good condition for
irrigation. SARH provides engineering services and supervises such contracts.
47.       The estimated cost of vehicles, farm machinery and equipment is
about US$8.8 million, out of which US$6 million would be subject to interna-
tional competitive bidding according to Bank Guidelines for Procurement.
A margin of preference up to 15 percent would be allowed for equipment produced
in Mexico.  About US$2.8 million worth of equipment, which for reasons of
efficiency are not suitable for international competitive bidding, would be
purchased through the Guarantor's ordinary procurement procedures (Schedule 2
to draft Guarantee Agreement).
Disbursement
48.       The loan is expected to be disbursed over a seven year period, mid-
1979 through mid-1986. A schedule of estimated disbursements is provided
in the Loan and Project Summary.
Project Impact
49.       The proposed project would directly benefit 19,700 families compris-
ing 17,250 eiidatarios and 2,450 private farmers. Of the 196,000 ha project
area, 137,500 ha (70 percent) are held by elidos and 58,500 ha are held by
private land owners. Average farm size is less than 10 ha, and 95 percent of
project beneficiaries have less than 20 ha. The present net incomes of these
farmers vary from US$500 to US$1,700, placing them in the lowest 30 percent of
the national income distribution.   At full development their net farm incomes
would increase three-fold, and would range from US$1,900 to US$6,000. Over



- 15 -
95 percent project benefits would accrue to small farmers whose holdings are
mostly in non-irrigated areas or zones affected by salinity. The five percent
of farmers whose holdings exceed 20 ha are concentrated in zones now served
by irrigation and not affected by salinity; they would receive less than five
percent of net project benefits.
50.       The project would decrease on-farm underemployment, through
provision of additional 3.3 million man-days of employment per year at
full development. In addition, it would generate substantial indirect
benefits by preventing salinization of additional lands and by creating
secondary employment opportunities.
Economic Evaluation
51.       The economic rate of return for the project is estimated to be
18 percent; sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return would be
14 percent if project cost were to increase by 10 percent and farm yields
decrease by 10 percent. This analysis does not include a share of the
costs of the Bacurato storage dam and other works financed under the ongoing
Rio Sinaloa irrigation project. An integrated analysis, including the cost
and benefit streams of the Rio Sinaloa project and the proposed Rio Fuerte/Rio
Sinaloa project, yields a rate of return above 13 percent.
Risks
52.       The project carries no major risks.  The quality and performance of
the project organization in the area is well above average even for Mexican
standards, and experience has shown that it is able to carry out infrastruc-
ture works, operate the irrigation system and provide research and extension
services in a satisfactory manner. Irrigated farming is well established in
the zone, and farmers should readily adopt modern technology and improved
production methods. Therefore, newly irrigated lands should easily reach
the yield levels conservatively projected. Reclamation of saline lands would
employ technologies proven in adjacent areas and has little risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional Financiera,
S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between United Mexican States and the
Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
54.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION: PROGRESS AND PROBLEMS 1/
Ln. No. 793    Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:  $22 Million Loan of January 22,
1972; Effectiveness Date: March 30, 1973. Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
All infrastructure works at Ixtapa and in the town of Zihuatanejo
are complete. The international airport at Zihuatanejo is now
being served by 35 flights a week from Mexico City. A new
bilateral air agreement between Mexico and the US was signed
in January 1978 that allows Mexican and US air carriers to
serve Zihuatanejo directly from 23 US cities. A comprehensive
hotel staff training program has been approved by the Bank and
is under implementation.
Ln. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply Project:  $90 Million Loan of
June 18, 1973; Effectiveness Date: April 30, 1974.
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Project works are well advanced except in the Texcoco Region.
Overall, more than half of the project works as originally
defined have been completed, and the works in progress are
expected to be completed by early 1980. The Government has
proposed that savings in carrying out some components of
the projects be applied to finance new works which would
serve the same objective of increasing bulk water supply to the
Mexico City metropolitan area. A recommendation on changes in
the project description will be submitted to Executive Directors
shortly.
Ln. No. 968    Seventh Highway Project:  $90 Million Loan of March 1, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: May 29, 1974. Closing Date: June 30. 1981.
Substantial initial delays have been encountered in project
works because of the shortage of budgetary allocations.
Substantial cost increases caused by price escalation were also
encountered. Taking this into account, a reduction in the scope
of the project was made in August 1977, from 16 roads (1,975
km) to ten roads and part of an eleventh road (1,216 km) which,
because of cost increases, have the same total cost as the
original project. The roads remaining in the project continue
to be well justified as benefits have kept pace with costs.
Completion is now expected in early 1981, or about two and a
half years behind schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in that sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 969    Rio Panuco Irrigation Project;  $77 Million Loan of
March 1, 1974; Effectiveness Date: May 29, 1974.
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Construction is over 60 percent completed and termination of
all works is scheduled for 1980. About 67,000 ha were planted
in the previous season; on full development the project will
provide irrigation to 137,000 ha. The technical assistance
program and the land settlement program are proceeding satis-
factorily.  However, inflation has been greater than estimated
at the time of appraisal, and project costs have risen from the
original estimate of US$208 million to about US$366 million
equivalent. A US$25 million supplemental Bank loan has been
approved July 11, 1978 to help finance the increase in cost
of this project (see Ln. No. 969-1 on page 8 of this Annex).
Ln. No. 970    Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project:  $47 Million Loan of
March 1, 1974; Effectiveness Date: May 29, 1974.
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Construction of major project works remain substantially
behind the original schedule; the pace is, however, acceler-
ating as additional budgetary support is being provided.
Project authorities have rephased project construction; a
substantial reduction in project scope was approved by the
Executive Directors (R79-51 of March 13, 1979).
Ln. No. 1022   Airport Development Project:  $25 Million Loan of
May 28, 1974; Effectiveness Date: September 16, 1974.
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project originally included the construction of seven
regional airports and the expansion of an existing one at
Campeche. Of these, the Guaymas airport works have been post-
poned by the Government because of interim improvements of the
existing airport carried out by the local municipality with its
own resources. At Campeche, the Government has decided to
construct a new airport with its own funds instead of improving
the existing airport. Loan proceeds allocated to Guaymas and
Campeche were reallocated in August 1977 to complete construction
of the six airports retained in the project. The Poza Rica
airport has been completed and works in the other five airports
are proceeding satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1053   Papaloapan Integrated Rural Development Project:  $50 Million
Loan of November 15, 1974; Effectiveness Date: January 27,
1975. Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Project implementation is accelerating after delays due to
inadequate budget support. Budget levels were raised for 1979
and a reprogramming of the project is planned during mid-1979
to adjust for these delays.
Ln. No. 1110   Integrated Rural Development Project (PIDER I):  $110 Million
Loan of May 8, 1975; Effectiveness Date: October 29, 1975.
Closing Date:  December 31, 1982.
Project investments are generally on schedule. An in-depth
mid-term evaluation was carried out in late 1978 and early
1979. Management is taking actions to further strengthen
project implementation. Special inter-agency agreements regard-
ing the development credit, agricultural extension, and farmer
organization components are being implemented. PIDER management
is taking steps to ensure the proper operation and maintenance
of earlier PIDER investments. Emphasis is also being given to
improved cost recovery, investment analysis and programming,
monitoring, and rural industries.
Ln. No. 1111   Seventh Irrigation Project - Bajo Rio Bravo and Balo Rio
San Juan: $150 Million Loan of May 8, 1975; subsequently
reduced to $50 Million; Effectiveness Date: July 30, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
In view of the project's size, complexity, and high cost, the
Government and the Bank agreed to phase project development over
a longer period of time and substantially reduce the scope of
the project to be financed under the Bank Loan (R77-305 of
December 13, 1977). A recent mission found progress under the
revised project to be satisfactory and confirmed the economic
viability of the reduced project (R79-56 of March 19, 1979).
Ln. No. 1112   Fertilizer Project:  $50 Million Loan of May 22, 1975;
Effectiveness Date:  July 30, 1975.  Closing Date:
March 31, 1980.
Construction delays were encountered early in 1977 due to a
shortage of resources following the peso devaluation, and
the problem was aggravated by changes in the company's manage-
ment at about the same time. Progress on the Salamanca project
has been slow and culminated in termination of the main con-
struction contract in March 1978. Since the appointment of a
new contractor in May 1978, the FERTIMEX construction manage-
ment organization has been strengthened, the speed of the work

has improved and completion is now scheduled for July 1979.
Construction of the 1,500 TPD urea plant at Coatzacoalcos is
also behind schedule, but work in this project is now proceed-
ing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by February
1980.
Ln. No. 1186   Medium Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project:  $40 million
Loan of January 13, 1976; Effectiveness Date:  April 26, 1976.
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Subloan agreements have been signed with five cities, where
construction has begun. The additional subprojects (which
would fully commit the loan funds) are being reviewed by the
Bank. Several positive measures have been taken by the Mexican
authorities to accelerate project execution, including the
preparation and implementation of guidelines for project
design and the reorganization of the Special Project Unit in
charge of project execution. Construction in three cities is
substantially on schedule and in two others, construction is
expected to begin in early 1979.
Ln. No. 1205   Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project:  $50 Million Loan of
April 30, 1976; Effectiveness Date: August 30, 1976. Closing
Date: December 31, 1979.
The loan is now fully committed.
Ln. No. 1217   Fifth Agricultural and Livestock Credit Project:  $125 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effectiveness Date: August 30, 1976.
Closing Date: January 1, 1980.
The medium-income producers' category is fully disbursed and
priority is being given to accelerating the project component
benefitting low-income farmers. The entire loan is expected
to be disbursed by mid-1979, six months ahead of schedule.
Ln. No. 1232   Third Railway Project:  $100 Million Loan of April 30, 1976;
Effectiveness Date: June 16, 1976. Closing Date: June 30,
1981.
Operating and technical improvements on the railway continue.
The traffic took an upward swing in 1977, continued to rise in
1978, and is expected to increase substantially in 1979. As a
result, the operating and working ratios improved significantly
in 1977 and 1978 and the outlook for 1979 is even better. Due
to budgetary cuts imposed by the Government in 1976-1977, the
railway has prepared a revised investment plan on the basis of
which revised financial targets and a revised list of goods
have been prepared with, and accepted by, the Bank. Due to
delays incurred in 1976-1977, the project will be completed
in late 1980, about two years behind schedule.

Ln. No. 1420   Baja California Tourism Project:  $42 Million Loan of
July 5, 1977; Effectiveness Date: June 28, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Construction of infrastructure at both project sites has begun.
The first 250-room hotel at Loreto is also under construction.
Project implementation is slightly behind schedule. An outline
for the ecological and environmental study is being reviewed
in the Bank. The marketing studies of domestic as well as
North American tourism are complete and the economic study of
tourism will be completed by June 1979.
Ln. No. 1462   Integrated Rural Development Project - PIDER II:  $120 million
Loan of July 5, 1977; Effectiveness Date: October 28, 1977;
Closing Date: July 31, 1981.
Implementation is on schedule. Project authorities have made
important progress in implementation of inter-agency agreements
to improve investment planning and execution.
Ln. No. 1524   Tourism Development Project:  $50 million Loan of March 21. 1978;
Effectiveness Date: January 12, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
A cofinancing loan of US$25 million was provided to the borrower
on December 1, 1978 by a group of commercial banks. Progress
of commitments is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 1552   Small- and Medium-Scale Industrial Development Project;
US$47 million Loan of May 4, 1978; Effectiveness Date:
January 12, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Management of the project has now been integrated with that of
FOGAIN, one of its main components. Training of the first
group of extension agents has started and submission of sub-
projects is expected to start soon.
Ln. No. 1553   Tropical Agricultural Development Project:  US$56 Million Loan
of September 27, 1978; Effectiveness Date: January 12, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
Implementation is on schedule. Technical assistance teams are
working with beneficiaries in the first two pilot project areas.
Investment plans for four additional pilot projects are in
advanced stages of preparation and will soon be submitted for
Bank approval.
