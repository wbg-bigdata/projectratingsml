CEXORANDW   AND RECONIDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
OP THE ZTUNATXONAL BaNK FOR RECONSTRUCTION aND DEVELOPMENS
TO TUE ECUTCIVE DZRUCTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TIM REPUBLIC OF CH=LE FOR AN
ENVZROIENTZL INSTIUTIONS DELOPMPNT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$11.5 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan would be repay&ble over 17 years, including 5
years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate. The Republic of Chile
(GOCH) would be the Borrower and the Technical and Administrative Secretariat
(STyA) of the National Environmental Commission (CONAMA) would be the Execut-
ing Agency.
2.        Background.  Chile faces a number of environmental pollution and
natural resources management issues. During recent years, the country has not
only exploited its natural resources, but also built an industrial base.
However, industrial pollution problems associated mainly with mines and
smelters, but also with pulp and fishmeal processing plants have remained
largely unregulated. Urbanization in the central region has been accompanied
by water and air pollution including severe pollution of rivers and the ocean
due to discharge of untreated sewage from Santiago and Valparaiso. The
serious air pollution in Santiago is attributed to dust particles combining
with traffic-related emissions. Soil erosion and watershed degradation
problems also remain; moreover, management of native forests has been neglect-
ed. Water scarcity and desertification are problems in the northern region.
Aquaculture is also raising issues related to water contamination along the
ecologically fragile coastline and in lakes. Traditional fisheries are
approaching or exceeding maximum sustainable yields for the most important
species.
3.        There is a growing realization in Chile that inadequate environme-
tal management could become an obstacle to economic growth and that strategies
are needed to move towards resource-conserving practices within the framework
of a market economy. Chile's weak institutional capacity to develop national
and local policies, strategies, and plans in the environmental sector is a key
constraint. The Government has placed high priority on resolving this
problem. In 1990, CONAMA and its operational arm, the STyA, were set up to be
responsible for coordination of environmental matters; moreover, the Govern-
ment is creating environmental units in sectoral ministries and special
regional commissions. The Government has begun to implement environmental
policies and regulations by issuing decrees for Automotive Vehicle Emission
Control, Regulation of S02, Arsenic and Particulate Emission, as well as a new
Fishery Law. The legal framework for management of native forests has been
presented to Congress. The project would support the development of the legal
framework for Sustainable Environmental Development (SED), which includes
regulations for Environmental Impact Assessment (BIA). The Government has now
requested Bank assistance to address its environmental problems in a systemat-
ic way.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government's request for Bank
assistance provides a unique opportunity to establish a regulatory and insti-
tutional framework for natural resource management and environmental protec-
tion, and to ensure that environmental policies reinforce the macroeconomic
and sectoral policies reeded for sustainable economic growth. The Bank sees
the establishment of a clear set of rules and regulations as a positive step
for the business climate in Chile, since investors favor a predictable situa-
tion concerning environmental regulations. The Bank's involvement would



-2 -
facilitate aid coordination to Chile, since a large number of multilateral and
bilateral assistance sources are delaying their projects until the appropriate
institutional arrangements are in place. The institutional arrangements
pursued by this operation will also reinforce a number of ongoing and planned
operations that have to tackle environmental problems at the sectoral level.
The project is the first environmental operation in Chile.
S.        Project Objectives.  The central project objective is to assist the
Government at two levels: institutional and sectoral. At the institutional
level, the project will support the implementation of sectoral policies and
plans aimed at establishing the institutional framework by: (a) strengthening
the technical administrative structure, and the financial management capacity
of the STyA; (b) putting into effect an environmefftal regulatory framework;
{c) requiring environmental assessment (EA) in public and private sector
investment projects; (d} training in environmental and natur-al resources
management; (e) developing an environmental education program for the general
public outside the formal education system; (f) implementing environmental
projects in local communities; (g) establishing an environmental information
system; and (h) developing economic analysis of environmental issues. At the
osstoral level, the project will strengthen priority sectors engagea in
environmental activities by: (a) improving the quality of management and
conservation of Chile's natural forest; (b) fostering debate leading to a
national industrial pollution strategy; and (c) supporting ongoing mining
sector initiatives to reduce the impact of sector activities on the environ-
ment.
6.        Project Description.  The project would support the above objectives
by financing two components to:
Establish the Xnstitutional Framework to Manage Environmental Protection
and Conservation of Natural Resources (76 percent of total project cost)
by: (a) providing about 890 staffmonths of technical assistance to
strengthen the institutional and financial management capacity of the
STyA; (b) hiring 87 professionals and 40 administrative personnel to
develop STyA at the central and regional levels, as well as environmental
ministerial units; (c) implementing a national training program for about
6,s50 participants in environmental and natural resources-related
subjects; (d) implementing community based workshops on environmental
issues for about 11,700 people; (e) providing study tours and fellowships
abroad for about 90 professionals; (f) developing and distributing about
6,550 sets of teaching materials and books; (g) implementing 34 studies
in sectoral environmental issues; (h) implementing about 30 environmental
improvement, community-based projects; and (i) providing office space,
data processing, vehicles and communications equipment, office supply and
maintenance for STyA headquarters and regional offices.
Support Priority Sectors Engaged in Environmental Protection and Conser-
vation of Natural Resources (24 percent of project cost) by:
(a) providing about 260 staffmonths of technical assistance to:
(i) carry out a forest and natural vegetation cadastre, a rapid air and
hazardous waste pollution irnventory in six regions, develop environmental
norms and standards relating to effluent discharge, solid waste disposal,
and mine abandonment; (b) implementing a training program for about 300
participants in: i) native eorest cadastre; (ii) rapid air and hazard-
ous waste pollution; and (iii) affluent discharge, solid waste disposal,
and mine abandonment; {c) implementing 12 studies to support natural
vegetation, water pollution, industrial pollution policies, as well as



the feasibility to recycle water for human consumption; and (d) providing
office, data processing and communicatione equipment, software, and
vehicles to implement the forest and natural resources cadastre.
7.        The total project cost is estimated at US$32.8 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$7.7 million (24 percent of the total
cost). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing cf up to US$0.6
million would be granted for expenditures incurred after August 1, 1992. This
would permit the Government to begin hiring consultants, services for the
STyA, purchasing equipment, implementing the fellowship program abroad, and
financing key project studies. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10989, dated October 26,
1992, is also attached.
S.        rmplementation Arrangements. The proceeds of the loan would be
disbursed over five years. The project would be implemented through the STyA.
STyA would be in charge of the overall coordination and monitoring of the
project, and directly execute the legal regulatory framework, NA, training and
dissemination, environmental information system, and institutional strengthen-
ing subccmponents. For the KA subcomponents, CONAMA has signed operational
agreements outlining roles and responsibilities with five Ministries. For the
economic analysis of environmental issues subcomponent, GOCH would establish
an interministeria' advisory committee and sign operating agreements with the
Central Bank, universities and research institutions. For the policy and
institutional strengthening of forestry, mining, and industrial sectors
subcomponents, CONAMW has signed operational agreements with CONAF and the
Ministries of Mining and Bconomy, respectively.
9.        Actions Agreed.  To facilitate the proposed project's implementa-
tion, the Ministry of National Resources has issued a Resolution and Protocol
granting STyA the necessary managerial and administrative autonomy. In
addition, the Ministries of National Resources, the Presidency, and Finance,
and the Secretary of STyA signed a protocol for the purpose of ensuring the
enforceability of such Resolution. Additionally, agreement has been reached
on:
(a) the five key variables that will serve as proxies for measuring the
project's impact; (b) an implementation schedule that concentrates on
high-impact and low-risk components for the first two years of the
project to develop public confidence in STyA; (c) dates on which STyA's
annual workplan would be furnished to the Bank for review every year;
(d) submission to the Bank by December 31, 1994, of norms and standards
for the mining industry with respect to effluent discharge, solid waste,
and abandoned mines; implementation of these would follow promptly after
Bank approval; (e) an annual evaluation of the project to be carried out
with the participation of an interdisciplinary team from Chilean academic
institutions, whose qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank;
(f) submission by December 31, 1995 of action plans based on the results
of the policy studies on water and industrial pollution; these action
plans would then be carried out as approved by the Bank; and (g) the
provision of counterpart funds required to carry out the project. It was
also confirmed that the Government expects to provide US$2 million for
the first year of project implementation.



-4-
10.       The following agreed actions have already been completed:  (a) the
final version of the Operational Manual containing procedures for procurement,
disbursement, and auditing was agreed; (b) the final vprsion of the terms of
reference MTORU) for all studies and consultancies to be carried out under the
project were agreed; and (c) the Interministerial Committee (IC) to review the
policy relevance and implications of the economic studies aimed at assessing
the full economic benefits and costs of the Governmentls environmental actions
has been appointed.
11.       The Government has already presented to Congress the Basic Law for
Suptainable Environmental Development, and the following actions have been
completed: (i) the sign:.ng of the respective operational agreements between
COKAMA, the National Forestry Corporation (CONAP), the Ministry of Economy,
and the Ministry of Mining, for implementation of their respective sub-
components; and (ii) the signing of the interministerial agreement to carry
out the environmental assessment subcomponent of the project. The signing of
the operational agreement between CONAMA and the Central Bank is a condition
for disbursements of funds for the subcomponent of Economic Analysis of
environmental issues.
12.      5enefits and Risks.  The project would contribute to sustainable and
efficient ; :onomic development by strengthening Government's capability to
manage and implement environmental and natural resource policies, strategies,
and plans. The project has important, ambitious objectives because the
establishment of a cco.prehensive framework for natural resource management and
environmental protection would constitute a fundamental policy change in
Chile.  The major risks are:  (a) STyA might encounter territorial disputes as
it strives to manage and implement fundamental policy changes in environmental
protection and conservation of natural resources in Chile; (b) the project is
institutionally complex; and (c) there might be resistance to the introduction
of EA in public and private sector investment projects. These risks will be
ameliorated under the project by: (a) providing STyA with the full capacity
to execute its mandate along with the necessary administrative and managerial
autonomy; (b) performing a joint Bank-STyA annual evaluation, including the
participation of external consultants; (c) establishing detailed operational
agreements with sectoral ministries and agencies involved in project implemen-
tation; (d) undertaking discussion with the private sector and main actors
during the development of policies and preparation of standards. Also,
comprehensive project preparation work has been carried out with the coopera-
tion of local and foreign consultants financed under the PPF, United Nations
Development Program (UNOP), and bilateral donors. Finally, the Bank supervi-
sion effort will be intensive during the initial stages of the project.
13.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
