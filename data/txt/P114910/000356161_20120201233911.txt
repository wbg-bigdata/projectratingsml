1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the results of the Public Finance
and Social Sector Developing Policy Loan (DPL) to El Salvador. The two tranche loan of
US$450 million (US$ 200 million/US$250 million) was approved by the World Bank
Executive Board of Directors on January 22, 2009.

1.1 Country context at Appraisal
Appraisal took place on December 3, 2008.
       a. Political environment
The country’s political environment at the time of the appraisal was characterized by
intense polarization. El Salvador’s two largest political parties –the governing National
Republic Alliance Party (ARENA) and the opposition Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front Party (FMLN) – dominated the political debate, but none of the two
parties held the majority in the National Assembly. This polarization created a challenge
for implementing reforms and approving loans. During the three years prior to this DPL,
five World Bank operations were approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors but all failed
to achieve the two-thirds majority needed for approval by El Salvador’s Congress.
The fact that this DPL was appraised shortly before elections increased political pressures,
but also created opportunities. The elections for Assembly and Municipality were
scheduled for January 2009, with presidential elections following in March 2009. The
uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election created a window of opportunity
in which both parties were interested in improving the fiscal condition for the following
presidential term. In this context, the Government requested Bank support to implement a
program of reforms designed in conjunction with the political opposition and civil society.
On November 6, 2008, Congress granted the Government the authority to negotiate a two-
tranche DPL that reflected consensus over a medium-term program to expand fiscal space
and maintain socio-economic progress.
       b. Economic context
The political consolidation after El Salvador civil war was accompanied by a series of
structural economic reforms, setting conditions for a period of broad based growth
(average 6 percent per year) during the 1990s. Major reforms included trade liberalization,
financial sector restructuring, re-privatization of the financial sector, and other state
enterprises, tax reforms, pension reforms, and competitiveness-enhancing measures. In the
early 2000s, growth decelerated to an average of 1.8 percent per year, reflecting slower
global growth in the post 9/11 period. Growth recovered in the 2005-2007 period to an
average of 4.0 percent per year, bolstered in part by strong performance in agriculture, and
a favorable external environment. On the external front, the relatively high current account
deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007- continued to be financed by high capital and
remittance inflows.
Macroeconomic management remained generally sound. The public sector deficit and the
ratio of public debt to GDP declined during most of the 2000s largely driven by an
increase in tax revenues (to 14.1 percent of GDP in 2007 from 12.1 percent of GDP in
2003). The primary balance reached 0.6 percent of GDP in 2007, the first surplus recorded


                                             1
in more than a decade (see Table 1). In 2008 tax revenues continued to grow at a robust
rate, but spending also accelerated, in large part due to the growing cost of untargeted
subsidies, public-sector wage increases, and pre-election spending. The subsidies on water,
cooking gas, electricity and transport reached US$500 million in 2008 (2.3 percent of the
GDP), in reaction to sharp increases in international commodity prices.

While poverty headcount declined and basic socioeconomic indicators improved in the
years prior to appraisal, El Salvador’s performance in social areas remained below regional
averages. Economic growth in conjunction with increased social spending contributed to
substantial declines in poverty. The poverty headcount decreased from 64.4 in 1991 to 34.6
in 2007. In addition, access to basic services, including safe water and sanitation, has
increased. Moreover, core health outcomes, such as life expectancy, infant and child
mortality, and child nutrition have all improved. By 2007, school enrollment among the
primary and secondary age-groups increased markedly to 94 and 64 percent from 75

challenges. The country’s 68 percent primary completion rates and the 64 percent
secondary enrollment were much lower than the LAC averages.
Despite the overall improvements, the social and economic outlooks reflected heightened
uncertainty. The DPL was prepared in the months after Lehman Brothers bankruptcy,
when the full impacts of event were not fully realized. At that time the crisis had not fully
reached the Salvadoran economy, although concerns that financial turbulence in the United
States and a slowdown in the U.S. economy (the main commercial partner of El Salvador)
would have serious implications on economic growth, social progress, financial and fiscal
stability were intensifying.
       c. Core challenges, medium term risks, and rational for Bank involvement
A key challenge at appraisal was the uncertainty regarding the impact of the global
financial crisis in El Salvador. Concerns about financial turbulence in the United States
were reflected on a downward revision in the growth projects. During the project
preparation, growth projection for 2008 and 2009 were reduced from 4 percent in both
years, to 3 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. Nevertheless, the crisis and its impact on
the Salvadoran economy were much larger than what was possible to estimate with the
available information at the time of preparation. Economic growth decelerated to 1.3
percent in 2008 and GDP contracted by 3.1 percent in 2009, driven by a drop in investment
and remittances. It is important to keep in mind that the DPL was prepared to support El
Salvador through a possible period of uncertainty. It was not a crisis response DPL, since
the crisis was only then starting to unfold.
External shocks represented a serious threat to social achievements. The gains in poverty
reduction achieved during the previous decade were negatively impacted by the rise in
food prices and the international turmoil. The poverty rate increased by around 5
percentage points in one year, reaching 40 percent at the end of 2008. The poor, and in
particular the urban poor, were disproportionally affected by the high food prices. An
economic slowdown also affected important sources of income for the poor, such as
remittances and labor intensive activities such as maquilas, construction, and commerce.
Another challenge was to protect poverty-reducing and growth-enhancing public
expenditures while maintaining fiscal stability. Mitigating the impacts of the crisis on the
poor would involve increasing the relatively low levels of social spending in the country,
but fiscal space was limited. Domestic factors such as high subsidies, and costs associated
to the pension reform added up to the pressures imposed by the global environment.
Transfers and subsidy expansions were the main tools used to mitigate the impacts of high
food and fuel prices. Nevertheless, these subsidies were untargeted and poorly designed,
increasing fiscal risks. Energy subsidies, for example, nearly doubled in 2008, reaching 2.5
percent of GDP. In addition, fiscal costs associated with the transition from a pay-as-you-
go pension system to a system of individual retirement accounts were estimated at 1.6
percent of GDP per year over the 2009-2012 period. While the situation made it difficult to
further increase total spending, there was scope for enhancing revenue collection,
improving planning, targeting and efficiency in the allocation of public resources.
Finally, the country faced risks associated with an unfavorable debt profile. Given the
difficulties to approve long term credit in Congress, El Salvador relied heavily on short-


                                             3
term debt instruments –LETES—to cover for cash-flow requirements (US$ 584 million,
2.8 percent of GDP). Moreover, the country needed a plan to amortize a bond series known
as Eurobond 2011. The concentrated amortization of the Eurobonds was expected to more
than double the debt services in 2011 to nearly $1.4 billion or 5.0 percent of GDP.
The Public Finance and Social Sector DPL was prepared to support the Government
strategy for dealing with emerging challenges associated with the uncertain global
economic conditions and compounded by the El Salvador debt profile. Pressures on the
fiscal front started to affect the country’s ability to make continued steady socio-economic
progress in the medium-term. Moreover, as mentioned above, unfavorable external factors
(including economic slowdown, financial market instability, high food and fuel prices, and
declining remittance growth) were already beginning to have a dampening effect on
growth and raising concerns that social gains could be threatened going forward. In this
context of heightened uncertainty, and taking advantage of the special political conjuncture
surrounding the elections, the Government requested Bank support to implement a
program based on external borrowing and internal reforms to ensure sustained progress on
social service provision and the strengthening of public institutions.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The main objectives of the Public Finance and Social Sector DPL were to: i) help El
Salvador strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability; (ii) support good governance and
transparency in the use of public resources; and (iii) maintain steady improvements in
social protection and education. Key outcome indicators were set as follows:
    I.   Expanding fiscal space for priority spending and improving targeting of existing
         public spending by:
           Increasing tax collection from 14.1 to 15 percent of GDP;
           Reducing the amount of untargeted public subsidies by 40 percent with respect
             to July 2008;
    II. Improving public expenditure management and fiscal transparency through:
           The establishment of a multi-year budget preparation and review process and
             associated results based framework;
           The creation of a Fiscal Transparency Portal providing access to public finance
             and budget information;
    III. Maintaining steady improvements in social protection and education by:
           Expanding the Conditional Cash Transfer Program Red Solidaria 1 to cover
             120,000 households;
           Improving the performance (as measured by test scores) of the lowest ranking
             schools by 3 percent by 2011;
           Increasing secondary education enrollment by about 28,000 students, about half
             of the number in non-formal programs.

  The program was re-assessed and re-named Comunidades Solidarias in 2009. Although, the program kept
most of its original features, the re-assessment indicated that the number of potential beneficiaries was lower
than initially envisaged. The target of the program was revised to 100,000 households.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification
Neither the PDO nor the core indicators were formally revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
The Public Finance and Social Sector DPL was fully consistent with the objectives of
World Bank engagement as laid out in the 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The
three main pillars of the Government strategy supported by the Bank were: i) accelerating
broad-based growth (including promoting macro stability and fiscal consolidation), ii)
improving equity and human capital, and iii) enhancing security and reducing vulnerability.
The DPL program encompassed seven priority areas:
      Expanding fiscal space through tax administration measures to fight tax evasion
       and new tax measures;
      Improving the targeting of existing public subsidies by eliminating the non-
       residential electricity subsidy;
      Further strengthening and modernizing the public financial management
       (PFM) through the expansion of the integrated financial management system
       (SAFI) and improvements in budget management;
      Increasing the transparency of Government spending by enabling and
       promoting access to fiscal information;
      Expanding the conditional cash-transfer program Red Solidaria that targets
       households with children living in the country’s poorest municipalities;
      Improving the quality of primary education through the implementation of a
       strategy to improve performance in the lowest ranking schools, and;
      Expanding access to secondary education through the implementation of the
       EDUCAME program;
The program design benefited from a number of World Bank AAA activities, including: i)
the Public Expenditure Review2010, under preparation at the time, which analyzed the
incidence of subsidies and taxation,; and ii) policy notes and technical assistance under the
Human Development for Poverty Reduction program, which monitored and assessed the
impact of Red Solidaria and of developments in education.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
No policy area was revised.

1.6 Other significant changes
Two conditions for second tranche release were partially waived. The waived elements
reflected the implementation of new, improved strategies (please see more details in the
next section).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance
The Public Finance and Social Sector DPL, a two-tranche operation, became effective on
February 25, 2009. The first tranche was disbursed shortly after effectiveness, on March 9,
2009 and the second tranche was disbursed three months earlier than originally expected,
on October 27, 2010. The early disbursement fulfilled a critical role in filling financing
gaps of the Government following the 2009 crisis. The loan closed on June 30, 2011.
Although the policy areas supported by the operation remained broadly unchanged during
the project implementation, adjustments in the Government strategy resulted in the partial
waiver of two conditions for second tranche release, as highlighted in Table 2. The
Government fully met five of the seven conditions set for the release of the second tranche
and made significant progress in meeting the remaining Conditions 1 and 7. In both cases,
the waived elements reflected the implementation of new, improved strategies and should
not be interpreted as an indication of lack of Government’s commitment to the project’s
objectives.
Condition 1 The Government requested a waiver for the third item specified in the legal
agreement. The item consisted of the installation of x-ray machines and weight controllers
in three custom posts: Acajutla (the largest port), Comapala (the largest airport), and San
Bartolo (the customs central office). The waiver request reflected the Government’s
decision of changing the customs posts in which the equipment would be installed. After
taking office in June 2009, the new administration commissioned an assessment of the
customs control strategy. The study concluded that trucks and containers would face high
risks of diversion on their way to the central office. For this reason, the Government
decided to go beyond the initial plan and install non-evasive monitoring systems in the
seven largest entry and exit points (responsible for 75 percent of the trade volume), instead
of installing them in San Bartolo.
Condition 7 was also partially met with the Government increasing the number of
education grants (cupos) under EDUCAME by 1,400 in 2009 compared to the required
10,000. In 2009 the Ministry of Education (MINED) completed the first monitoring and
evaluation cycle of all current modalities of the program (distance, accelerated, flex time,
night school, virtual) and concluded that there were a number of structural quality
problems with some of the offered alternatives and consequently decided to consolidate the
program before expanding it. To increase the efficiency and the academic quality of the
program the Government created an electronic registry system for students and teachers
under the newly incorporated modalities; b) re-trained 261 existing teachers and trained
1987 new tutors; c) distributed new education materials; d) reduced the average classroom
size; and e) applied standardized end-of-the-year exams to all students in the program. The
modest increase in EDUCAME grants (1,400) was partially compensated however by a
larger than anticipated expansion in the regular secondary system (by 14,000) such that the
overall increase in secondary enrollments remained close to the targeted outcomes of
18,000.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation
The implementation of the program was negatively affected by the following factors:
      Impacts of the global financial crisis. Economic performance was severely
       affected by the global economic crisis. GDP expanded only 1.3 percent in 2008
       (compared to an initial projection of 4 percent), and GDP contracted by 3.1 percent
       in 2009. The sharp economic slowdown resulted in job losses, especially in the
       export sector, lower incomes, and a sharp drop in remittances, down by 9.4 percent
       in 2009 relative to 2008. The crisis also impacted the fiscal accounts. The economic
       slowdown contributed to a drop in tax revenues from 13.1 percent of GDP in 2008
       to 12.4 percent in 2009, delaying the results of the tax measures implement by the
       government in the period. Despite the Government’s efforts to restrain non priority
       spending, public expenditure rose to 22.1 percent of GDP in 2009. This result was
       led by both a GDP decline and additional spending related to the Government’s
       anti-crisis. In turn, the primary public sector deficit increased to 3.1 percent of
       GDP, from a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2008, while the overall fiscal deficit
       increased from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 5.6 percent in 2009. Meanwhile the
       debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 41 to 50 percent. Nevertheless, when one looks
       at the cyclically-adjusted primary balance the Government’s efforts towards
       medium-term fiscal sustainability are evident, as the cyclically-adjusted primary
       balance remained at 1.5 percent of GDP, while the fiscal impulse declined from 0.9
       percent of GDP in 2008 to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2009.
       Despite the impacts of the crisis, medium term sustainability remained a priority. In
       February 2010, El Salvador entered an IMF Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) that
       supported the implementation of a sustainable fiscal framework. The IMF program
       envisions a gradual increase in the primary surplus to bring the public debt to
       sustainable levels by 2015. Fiscal consolidation under the program is achieved by
       maintaining total spending (and reallocating spending towards well-targeted social
       programs), while significantly increasing public revenues. The reforms supported
       by this DPL were fully in line with the IMF supported strategy and contributed to
       fiscal consolidation as the economy started recovering.


                                                     8
      Impacts of Hurricane Ida. On November 7 and 8, 2009, El Salvador was hit by
       Hurricane Ida, with widespread destruction of homes, water-supply, and power
       systems in 11 municipalities. The Government responded immediately to this
       natural disaster but the scale of the reconstruction effort put an additional strain on
       Government resources. The damage left more than 75,000 individuals displaced,
       and floods and landslides killed approximately 200 people. The Government
       identified about US$100 million (approximately 0.5 percent of GDP) in
       infrastructure damage (bridges, highways, and schools) and agricultural losses.
       Conscious of the fragility of the fiscal situation, the Government did not increase
       public spending but reallocated funds from existing projects of the Inter-American
       Development Bank (IDB) to finance reconstruction. The Hurricane also led to the
       Government prioritizing certain social programs to the municipalities hit by the
       disaster.
Nevertheless, program implementation has been satisfactory mainly due to the following
factors:
      Extensive consultation, consensus building and ownership: The extensive
       consultation with the different political forces during preparation stage helped build
       consensus over the operation design and over the medium term program supported
       by the two-tranches. The consultations also ensured ownership and commitment
       from the new Government. After 20 years in the opposition, in March 2009 the
       FMLN came to power with the election of Mauricio Funes for president. The new
       Government platform consolidated the advance of the social policy agenda as a
       priority. Even though the DPL was prepared by the previous government, it
       remained relevant and consistent with the new Government’s priorities.
      Appropriateness of Risks and Mitigation Measures: The operation had
       identified four main sources of risk: (i) political risks, associated with the context in
       which the operation was prepared; (ii) macroeconomic risk, stemming from deer-
       than-expected global deceleration; (iii) natural disaster risks; and (iv) design risks,
       associated with the two-tranche format. The risks were appropriately identified and
       mitigated. As previously discussed, risks (i) and (iv) have been minimized by
       extensive consultation and consensus building among relevant stakeholders,
       including the main opposition party at the time. Despite the fact that risks (ii) and
       (iii) materialized, program implementation continued. On the macroeconomic front,
       program design was an important factor. The program emphasized the need for
       fiscal restraint; the expansion of the fiscal envelope and the reduction in untargeted
       subsidies. The expansion of the Red Solidaria also helped mitigate the impact of
       the crisis on the poor.
      Coordination with other World Bank operations: During the second half of
       2009, the World Bank prepared and approved a stand-alone DPL that bridged the
       two tranches of this operation. The stand-alone DPL supported the Government’s
       Anti-Crisis Plan to protect social gains and reinforce the framework for economic
       recovery. The Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery DPL helped to fill
       the financing gap created by the crisis and allowed the Government to continue
       implementing the program supported by this operation.
      Collaboration with other donors: The DPL was complemented by a similar
       policy-based operation prepared by the IDB. The authority granted by the


                                              9
       Salvadoran Congress to the Government to negotiate the DPL was part of a larger
       package that also included the authority to negotiate a US$500 million operation
       with the IDB. The IDB operation supported a set of policies aimed at improving
       targeting mechanisms for social programs and the information system of the
       country’s main safety net program, Red Solidaria. In addition, the strategy for this
       operation and the analysis of the country’s fiscal situation was undertaken in close
       collaboration with the IMF.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
Design. Outcome indicators, baseline values, and targets were assigned to each of the
policy areas defined under the Program. The design focused on outcome and output
indicators that were easy to calculate with reliable existing information. Whenever possible
the M&E sought to align output indicators to indicators and targets frequently monitored
by the Government, such as tax revenues to GDP, number of beneficiaries from social
programs, and school enrollments. The M&E arrangements also stated clear
responsibilities within the Government for data collection and join responsibilities between
the Government and the Bank in the preparation of periodic reports.
Outcome indicators were well designed and measured to track the short and medium term
impacts of the supported programs. The adequacy of the indicators is satisfactory, and
quality and reliable existing data was used for decision making. Nevertheless, in one case,
the release of new information led to minor adjustments in base line and target values. An
updated assessment of Comunidades Solidarias in the 100 poorest municipalities revealed
that the program would cover 100,000 targeted households instead of the 120,000 initially
envisaged.
Implementation. The Ministry of Finance (MF) was responsible for implementing the
DPL and for coordinating the actions among the different agencies involved, including the
Central Bank, the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency, and the Ministry of Education.
Together with the MF, these institutions collected the data necessary for assessing the
implementation progress and delivered them in a timely fashion. The Government prepared
progress reports on the implementation of agreed action plans linked to the second-tranche
release, in particular regarding the implementation of a strategy to address non-performing
schools deficiencies. The MF and the World Bank have agreed to conduct joint reviews of
program progress on a semi-annual basis in order to identify strengths and weaknesses as
well as possible downside risks and measures to address them. A mid-year review was
undertaken in preparation for the next Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with the
Government and the Bank jointly evaluating progress towards achieving the outcomes laid
out in the DPL program.
Data collection was appropriate and indicators were reported on a timely basis, but it is
worth discussing a few methodological aspects. Indicator 1, tax to GDP ratio, was
particularly affected by the global crisis and did not fully reflect the Government’s efforts
to improve revenue collection. Tax to GDP fell to 13.4 percent in 2009 mainly due to a
slowdown in economic activity. As for Indicator 7, the share of non-performing schools,
the second–round of exams applied in September 2010 focused only on the 410 non-
performing schools. The Government decided that implementing the exam on a smaller
scale, with lower costs, would be more appropriate given the tighter economic and fiscal


                                             10
environment. The exam allowed us to track progress among the non-performing schools,
but prevents us from assessing whether the schools that were previously performing
satisfactorily have not fallen behind. Furthermore, the school exam might not be
sustainable going forward.
Utilization. The Bank used data collected from the outcome indicators as an entry point to
engage with the Government on the development of new investment lending and a new
programmatic DPL. In some cases, such as Indicator 1 (tax to GDP) and Indicator 5 (share
of public procurement process recoded and published in COMPRASAL), the same
outcome indicators continued to be used in the new projects to track further progress.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
The Bank continued providing assistance in the policy areas supported under the Public
Finance and Social Sector DPL through the Sustaining Social Gains for Economic
Recovery DPL (US$ 100 million, approved on November 24, 2009) and the Public
Finance and Social Progress DPL series (first operation of US$100 million, approved on
June 2, 2011). In parallel, the World Bank prepared two technical assistance loans to El
Salvador: the Income Support and Employability Project (US$50 million, approved on
November 24, 2009) and the Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance Technical
Assistance Loan (US$20 million, approved on November 24, 2009).
The Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery DPL supported the Government’s
immediate measures in the Anti-Crisis Plan to protect the poor, while supporting the
process of economic recovery through the design institutional strengthening in the social
sectors,. The Public Finance and Social Progress DPL series builds on the progress
achieved under the previous DPLs. It reflects the Government’s priority of achieving
fiscally and economically sustainable social progress. In particular, the DPL series
continued supporting the Government’s program to create fiscal space needed for
sustainable social spending and protect vulnerable segments.
Finally, the Income Support and Employability Project and the Fiscal Management and
Public Sector Performance Technical Assistance Loan assist the Government in the design
and implementation of the social and fiscal agenda supported by the above mentioned
DPLs. The Income Support and Employability Loan supports the expansion of a temporary
income and training program targeted to the poor and the unemployed, in particular youth
and women. The Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance Loan will contribute
to strengthening the institutional capacity of Government agencies for increasing the
effectiveness and efficiency of revenue and expenditure management, and enhancing
accountability and transparency in the public sector.

Box 1. Bank support to El Salvador in Response to the Global Financial Crisis
As the Salvadoran economy started experiencing severe impacts of the global crisis in mid-2009
the Government requested Bank support for the financing and implementation of an Anti-crisis
plan. Given that the ongoing Public Finance and Social Sector DPL had a second tranche pending
disbursement, the financial support request could have been met with an early disbursement.
Nevertheless, the project’s team assessed that an early disbursement could imperil the program
supported by the two tranche DPL as at the time several of the second tranche conditions had not
been met yet. Moreover the program was particularly relevant under the volatile economic situation
and the Bank proceeded to support the Government’s crisis response with a separate operation, the
Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery DPL, which was designed as a bridge between the
two-tranches of this operation, helping the Government to meet the immediate financing needs,
implement anti-crisis measures, and continue implementing the DPL supported program.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Program Development Objectives (PDOs) continue to be relevant. The Salvadoran
economy has faced important changes since the preparation of the Public Finance and
Social Sector DPL. Yet, the operation remained relevant to the country’s challenges. On
the internal front, the FMLN came to power. The new Government’s Development Plan
2010-2014 consolidated the advance of the social policy agenda as a priority, although it
recognized the importance of sustaining macroeconomic stability and building consensus
during this process. The program is fully consistent with the PDOs. On the external front,
changes related to a slowdown in the global economy and the uncertainty due to the Euro
crisis. While the Salvadoran economy started recovering from the impacts of the financial
crisis, the current external environment still poses a threat. The policies supported by the
DPL helped reduce the fiscal and social concerns generated by the international turmoil.
These policy areas continue to be supported by other Bank operations that assist the
Government in sustaining social spending while the economy fully recovers.
The actions taken under the program contributed to medium term fiscal sustainability
while helping protect fiscal space for social spending. Despite the Government actions to
restrain non priority spending improved tax collection the fiscal accounts deteriorated in
2009, mainly driven by the impacts of the economic slowdown on government revenues. It
worth mentioning, however, that the cyclically–adjusted primary balance remained
unchanged at 1.5 percent of GDP, while the fiscal impulse declined from 0.9 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2009. It is possible that, given the severity of the
exogenous shocks, the fiscal situation would have deteriorated further in the absence of the
supported reforms. In addition the supported tax measures contributed to a significant
expansion in revenues as the economy started recovering, consistent with the medium term
fiscal consolidation strategy proposed by the government.
The DPL also started the policy dialogue on targeting subsidies. This dialogue was
continued by other Bank operations. The actions taken were also relevant for supporting
good governance and transparency in the use of public resources. Finally, the actions taken
on the social protection and education fronts help to strengthen delivery of social services;




                                               12
and increase economic opportunities for the poor, two of the three pillars of the 2010-2012
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)2.
All outcome indicators continue to be relevant, however target values for one indicator was
subject to minor adjustments. As discussed in section 2 above, Indicator 6, number of
households covered by the Comunidades Solidarias Program, was adjusted downward.
Indicators such as tax revenues to GDP, subsidy spending, publications in COMPRASAL,
and number of beneficiaries under Comunidades Solidarias, continue to be used to monitor
progress by the CPS and the recent lending operations.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Overall the program was successful in achieving the proposed objectives. As reported in
Section 1.2, the PDOs were to: i) help El Salvador strengthen medium-term fiscal
sustainability; (ii) support good governance and transparency in the use of public
resources; and (iii) maintain steady improvements in social protection and education. The
outcome results and current status of policy areas under each objective are discussed in
turn below.
Objective 1 – Help strengthen El Salvador’s medium-term fiscal sustainability
The operation contributed to El Salvador’s fiscal sustainability in the post-crisis period,
while protecting fiscal space to protect priority social spending. The Government efforts to
consolidate fiscal accounts included the induction of new taxes and tax administration
measures, and the better targeting of subsidies. The impacts of these efforts, however, were
undermined by the severity of the crisis. On the revenues side, a large contraction in output
caused tax revenues to decline by 9.6 percent in 2009, notwithstanding the new tax
measures and the tax administration measures. In addition, immediate policy responses to
the crisis led to an increase of 3.5 percent in government spending. However, as the
economy started recovering, new tax measures and tax administration measures to fight tax
evasion helped increase in gross tax collection to 15.2 of GDP in the year to June 30, 2011.
In addition, the amount of untargeted subsidies has been reduced to US$217 million in the
year to June 30, 2011
Policy Area 1a. Increasing tax collection. Achieved. Gross tax revenues increased to an
estimated 15.2 percent of GDP for the period July 2010 - June 2011, up from 13.6 percent
of GDP during the previous twelve months. The tax collection as a share of GDP was
slightly above the target of 15 percent of GDP, despite the slower than expected economic
growth attributed to high international energy prices and slow growth in the U.S. economy.
This result was driven by a combination of tax measures. The Government introduced a
new tax on vehicles and an ad-valorem tax on alcoholic beverages, increased the excise
taxes on alcoholic beverages and extended it to non-carbonated drinks. The Government
further improved tax collection by enhancing control of large taxpayers, improving
coordination among tax agencies, and creating vice-ministry of revenue to further

 Given the political risks and economic uncertainties that market the previous CPS cycle, the Bank team
decided to prepare a shorter and more flexible strategy. The 2011 CPS progress report reviewed the Bank
program and extended the CPS coverage period until 2014.


                                                    13
strengthen tax administration capacity. The Government also continues to make progress
in the implementation of monitoring mechanisms for border control.
Policy Area 1b. Elimination of non-residential electricity subsidies. Partially Achieved.
The Bank had been engaged in a dialogue to rationalize untargeted subsidies that added
increasing pressures to Government spending due to high energy prices. In 2008 subsidy
costs were estimated at US$420 million (2 percent of GDP), of which US$336 million
were untargeted. There were two types of subsidies in place for electricity consumption in
El Salvador: a generalized subsidy for households and businesses, which in 2008 amounted
to 0.7 percent of GDP (35 percent of the cost of all subsidies), and a targeted subsidy to
households with consumption of less than 99 kWh per month. In March 2009 the
generalized subsidy was eliminated. The Government also improved the targeting of water
(February 2010) and gas (January 2011) subsidies. Nonetheless, in April 2010 and
February 2011, temporary subsidies (6 months) were reintroduced for residential
consumers with consumption of less than 300kWh per month (95 percent of total
residential consumers). The benefit for firms was never re-established. Most recently, in
order to mitigate the adverse price shocks, the Government also temporarily expanded
subsidies to transport operators, and suspended an excise tax on fuel. Combined, the
untargeted subsidies to transport and the temporary subsidies to electricity cost US$149
million between July 2010 and June 2011. Since the targeting of gas subsidy was only
implemented in early 2011, from July 2010 to June 2011 the Government also spent
approximately US$68 million in ―untargeted‖ gas subsidy.
Objective 2 – Maintain steady improvement in social protection and education
Policy Area 2a. Expansion of the conditional cash-transfer program Red Solidaria.
Partially achieved. The program was fully implemented in the 100 poorest municipalities
of the country, but the total number of beneficiaries and amount of transfers in June 2011
were lower than the operation targets. The program covered 98,000 households in 2010,
and 92,100 in June, 2011, below the revised targets of 100,000 households. In 2009, the
Government had re-assessed the number of targeted households to 100,000 from 120,000
households. By September 2009 the program reached 106,000 beneficiaries. Since then,
the number of beneficiaries has declined due to demographic and economic changes.
Some households became ineligible as their income rose above the cut-off threshold,
others have migrated out of the targeted municipalities or their children finished school. In
fact, rural poverty rate fell from 46.5 percent in 2009 to 43.2 percent in 2010, while
extreme poverty in rural areas fell from 17.5 to 15.1 percent in the same period.
Policy Area 2b. Improvement of the quality of primary education. Achieved. The
Government reduced the number of non-performing schools, as measured by the average
test scores, to 204 schools by June 30, 2011 (4 percent of primary schools), down from 410
non-performing schools in 2007 (8 percent of primary schools). The results are consistent
with the implementation of Government strategy to improve the quality of education in
non-performing schools. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, the second round exam
was applied only to the 410 non-performing schools indentified in 2007, and cannot assess
whether performance of other schools remained satisfactory.
Policy Area 2c.      Expansion of access to secondary education. Achieved. The total
enrollment in secondary public and private schools in regular regime and in the flexible
regime (EDÚCAME) increased to 633,369 students by December 31, 2010, meeting the


                                             14
target set in the DPL program of 632,799 enrolled students. The enrollment growth
followed the elimination of tuitions and graduation fees in secondary education, the
expansion in the number of operating classrooms, and the creation of grants under
EDÚCAME - a program that offers flexible modalities for completing the secondary
curriculum, including web-based distance learning, accelerated secondary programs and
―flex-time‖ courses. The total number of students under EDÚCAME significantly
increased since its creation reaching about 55,000 in 2008. However, in 2009 the Ministry
of Education concluded the first complete monitoring and evaluation of the program,
which detected structural problems with the quality of some of the offered modalities. As a
result, the Government decided to focus on consolidating the program before continuing its
expansion. The modest increase of EDÚCAME grants was compensated by a larger than
anticipated expansion in the regular secondary system.
Objective 3 – Support good governance and transparency in the use of public
resources
Policy Area 3a.       Strengthening and further modernizing the public financial
management. Achieved. The Multi-Year Budget preparation and review process and the
results based framework have increased the Government’s ability to plan strategically the
use of public resources. The Government continued to move towards a medium-term and
results-based budget framework, with particular emphasis on the ―bottom-up‖ preparation
of cost strategic plans consistent with the ―top-down‖ fiscal framework. As part of its
program to strengthen public resource management, the Government defined a medium-
term budget framework that was incorporated to the budget law of 2011. The framework
stated medium-term fiscal policy objectives and presented forecasts for the main
macroeconomic and fiscal indicators. The medium-term framework sought to support the
2010-2014 Government program while assuring fiscal sustainability. In addition, the
Government defined a result-based budgeting methodology, following international best
practices for linking policy objectives to the budget allocations using performance
indicators. Performance indicators are used both as a monitoring device and as an input to
the following year’s budget. The result-based budgeting was piloted in the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Ministry of Health as part of the budget law of 2011 and has been
expanded to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Education as part of the
budget law of 2012.
Policy Area 3b.        Increasing the transparency of Government spending. Achieved.
The Government enabled and promoted access to information on public finances and
budgetary execution through the Fiscal Transparency Portal. In addition, the Government
exceeded the target for the actual procurement recorded and published in COMPRASAL,
with 92 percent of procurement being recorded as of December 31, 2010, well in excess of
the targeted 80 percent. Advancing in the transparency, accountability, and freedom of
information agenda was critical in view of existing negative perceptions and mistrust
among other stakeholders in El Salvador. While the actions linked to the first tranche of
this loan focused on the transparency and efficiency of the public procurement system, the
condition for the second tranche focused on the access to information for the annual budget
law as well as the dissemination of interim reporting on public finance and investment
programs. Executive decree No. 850 defined the norms for the public access to public
financial information. Supported by the decree, the Ministry of Finance has successfully
launched a Fiscal Transparency Portal that provides easy access to a broader set of fiscal

                                            15
data, incorporating elements from international best practices as intended by the condition.
In December 2010, a new Access to Public Information Law was approved. The Law,
designed according to international best practices, regulated and enforced the information
released by all Government agencies and private entities that operate with the public sector.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating is Satisfactory. By and large, the DPL achieved the Program
Development Objectives (PDOs) proposed. The supported program helped to protect fiscal
space for priority social expenditures, and improve public expenditure management and
fiscal transparency, despite the unfavorable external environment. The operation also
helped the Government debt management strategy, allowing the repayment of short-term
bills and the 2011 Eurobonds. Finally, the timely release of the second-tranche helped fill
financing gaps of the Government following the 2009 crisis. Most outcomes were achieved,
but the program faced minor shortcomings with respect to the timing of the subsidy
reforms and the number of households reached by Comunidades Solidarias. In the first
case, subsidy spending was 11 percent higher than projected values, while in the second
case 92 percent of targeted households remained covered by the program. Despite these
minor shortcomings the DPL successfully assisted the Government in strengthening fiscal
and public finance management and continuing expanding social and education programs.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The horizon of the DPL was too short for the Program to have an identifiable impact on
growth, poverty, gender or social development. One can, however, make speculations
about the long-run impact of the Program, which are likely to be positive given the direct
interventions targeting the poor and vulnerable populations. The analyses developed on the
latest Public Expenditure Review for El Salvador suggests that overall, electricity subsidies
are regressive and reducing them is likely to have led to favorable distributional effects.
The implications are less clear for the newly created taxes. Tax reforms could have
produced adverse distributional effects. The expansion of the coverage of Comunidades
Solidarias increased transfers to the country’s lowest income households, helping to
improve standards of living among this group. Over the longer term, increased access to
secondary education by vulnerable groups is also likely to have positive distributional
effects.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The DPL helped promoting institutional changes by supporting actions to strengthen and
further modernize the public financial management and increase the fiscal transparency.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The assessment of risk to development outcomes is Moderate.
Political risks The polarized political climate in El Salvador continues to be a potential
obstacle to approve reforms and loans. In addition, the upcoming Congressional elections
(March 2012) further increased tensions in congress. This risk continues to be mitigated, to
a large extent, by an inclusive consultation process. For example, the Government’s
Development Plan 2010-2014 was elaborated in consultation with an extensive list of
stakeholders and it is fully consistent with the DPL development objectives. In addition to
the consultations under preparations, the strategies and priorities in the plan were
submitted to the Economic and Social Counsel 3 and approved by its members.
Consultations have also been part of all Bank prepared operation following this DPL.
Macroeconomic risks: The prolonged global deceleration and higher volatility continue to
impose risks to the El Salvador economy. The potential impacts on the country are similar
to the ones associated with the 2008 financial crisis, including lower growth, fiscal, social
and financial pressures. In some fronts, the government is now better prepared to mitigate
the impact of the crisis. Since 2008 the government implemented Comunidades Solidarias
in the poorest rural municipalities and it is expanding the program to vulnerable urban
areas. The program can work as an instrument to sustain the standards of living of the poor.
In addition, the government has strengthened the financial sector monitoring and crisis
preparedness framework. In other fronts the government position is more vulnerable.
Economic growth remains low compared with other countries in the region and it is
expected to remain below its potential level in 2012 due to the unfavorable external
environment. Despite fiscal consolidation efforts, the public debt and fiscal accounts are
not fully recovered and fiscal space for countercyclical policy is lower than in 2008.
Volatility of commodity prices also represents a source of risk. While the Government
advanced in targeting and rationalizing subsidies, increases in fuel prices and its impact on
energy costs could still contribute to fiscal pressures.
Social risks. Slower growth in conjunction with higher fuel and food prices could make
steady improvements in social protection more challenging. By June 2011 annual
consumer price inflation accelerated to 6.3 percent, while food inflation accelerated to
nearly 10 percent year-on-year by April 2011. The impacts of food prices to the poor are
being partially mitigated by the expansion of Comunidades Solidarias to vulnerable urban
areas.
Natural disasters risks. El Salvador is highly vulnerable to multiple natural disasters risks
–floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. A major climatic or seismic disaster poses a
significant threat to economic growth and fiscal stability and can delay the Government’s
program. In fact, the country has been recently hit by a prolonged period of tropical storms.
While the Government efforts to strengthening disaster management systems help prevent

fatalities, the economic impacts of the storms are significant (up to US$850 million). The
recently prepared CAT-DDO (US$50 million) is meeting immediate financing resources
while the Government mobilizes additional resource. The occurrence of a major natural
disaster like this would likely imply a reassessment of the country’s development priorities
(at least temporarily) and delays progress towards the medium term development
objectives.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
The design of the DPL was appropriate, timely, and relevant for addressing the challenges
faced by the country given external developments, including higher commodity prices. The
Public Finance and Social Sector DPL was designed in close collaboration with the
Government to ensure the actions supported by the operation were fully consistent with the
country’s long term development goals. The extensive consultation and consensus building
activities during preparation were essential to the approval and sustainability of the
operation, mitigating the political risks associated with Congressional and presidential
elections. The staff is to be commended for its dedication to building consensus not only
among main parties but also think thanks and civil society and for its responsiveness and
dedication. The continued engagement through analytical work and efforts to coordinate
with other key donor such as the IDB and IMF also contribute to the timely preparation
and relevance of the operation.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Supervision was carried in two main ways. Formal join-supervisions took place in a semi-
annual basis following the Ministry of Finance and the Bank agreement during project
preparation. These reviews aimed at identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses, and
possible assistance needed to maintain momentum toward the planned medium-term
outcomes. These reviews are summarized in the four Implementation Status and Results
(ISR) on May 8, 2009, December 22, 2009, June 1, 2010, and February 8, 2011. Program
Performance was considered satisfactory by the four ISR reports. In parallel, information
supervision took place when team members visited the country in the context of other TA
and DPL operations. Supervision was also successful given clear assignment of
responsibilities and the Ministry of Finance’s capacity to collect, organize, and timely
share the relevant monitoring information.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. The operation supported relevant
development objectives, and helped building consensus around those issues not only
among the main parties but also think tanks and civil society.


                                            18
Many aspects of Bank performance contribute to this outcome. First, the continued
engagement through analytical work and good knowledge of the country political context
helped identify and respond in a relevant timely manner to the window of opportunity
created by the election. Second, the Bank’s coordination with other donors helped provide
combined assistance to a relevant and coherent medium term program of reforms, taking
advantage of this window of opportunity. Third, the Bank’s key role in promoting
consultation and building consensus was also an important factor of success. Finally the
period monitoring and the evaluation system in place allowed both the Government and the
Bank to periodically track and ensure progress toward the target outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance (the implementing agency for this operation was the
Ministry of Finance)
Rating: Satisfactory
Throughout the preparation and supervision process of the operation the Ministry of
Finance successfully coordinated the many Ministries and institutions involved in the
operation including, the Central Bank, the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency, and
MINED. They were instrumental in shaping the actions of each institution into a cohesive
operation and ensuring the timely implementation of most prior actions and conditions of
the program.
(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall the Borrower’s performance is rated as Satisfactory given its high level of
engagement during the preparation, implementation and supervision. The Government was
very effective in coordinating the different ministries and institutions involved in the
Program.

6. Lessons Learned
The mains lessons associated with the operation relate to the Bank’s preparedness and
flexibility to adapt to the country’s context. Bank staff worked assiduously to promote
consultation and consensus-building activities and their involvement in these activities was
essential to the successful approval and implementation DPL’s program in a politically
polarized environment. The DPL’s preparation was followed by the Policy Dialogue and
Consensus Building non-lending technical assistance. The activity supported the
Government’s efforts to sustain a policy debate in consultation with a large number of
stakeholders and to reach an agreement with the opposition party over a medium term
program. The Bank has also coordinated with IDB to get congressional approval for the
Bank’s DPL and the IDB’s US$500 million policy-based operation. Bundling the two
operations together has perhaps improved the chances of getting the operations approved
by the Salvadoran Congress.
Despite the difficulties encountered in obtaining approval of foreign borrowing in the
Assembly, the Bank remained fully engaged, contributing via analytical work and
strategy/program development. This body of analytical work helped the Bank team to


                                            19
respond quickly to respond to the government request within the window of opportunity
generated by the political context. Analytical work helped to identify gaps in specific
sectors, inform stakeholders, build consensus around important development issues, and
prepare the groundwork for future engagement in areas of mutual interest.
The flexibility on the operation’s design, and in particular the option to choose a two-
tranche loan, helped the Bank to better respond to the country’s need. El Salvador political
moment and the agreement over medium term reform offered the adequate conditions for
two-tranche operation. While the two-tranche design reinforced the new Government’s
commitment over the agreed program, it avoided political costs associated with the
approval of a second operation. This design has proven particularly useful in the context of
the 2009 crisis, where the Bank was able to quickly recognize the Government’s progress
and release the resources to meet immediate financing needs.

                                      Préstamo para Políticas de Desarrollo (DPL)
                                      de las Finanzas Públicas y del Sector Social
                                                Préstamo BIRF-7635-SV
                                                República de El Salvador
                                                    Octubre de 2011

A. Introducción / Contexto

     El entorno económico mundial se caracterizó entre los años 2007 – 2009 por una fuerte desestabilización
     financiera internacional, que derivó en un período de recesión en los países desarrollados, así por ejemplo
     los EE.UU4 registró tasas de variación del PIB de 1.9% en 2007, 0.0% en 2008 y -2.6% en 2009; dicha
     turbulencia financiera alcanzó a otras regiones del mundo, y El Salvador no fue la excepción. El país sufrió
     el impacto de dicha recesión, resultando en problemas de liquidez para el Gobierno. Asimismo, el contexto
     económico global se caracterizó por elevados y volátiles precios del petróleo, crisis alimentaria y una
     sostenida desaceleración mundial, factores que continúan imponiendo grandes desafíos a los distintos
     mercados a nivel global, y especialmente a El Salvador por su grado de interrelación con la economía de
     EE.UU

     Las consecuencias negativas de la recesión global se manifestaron en la contracción de la actividad
     económica del país, la disminución del envío de las remesas familiares (las que registraron al cierre de
     2009 una disminución de alrededor del 9.4% respecto al 2008), la baja en las exportaciones e
     importaciones, entre otros. Los efectos anteriores impactaron los ingresos tributarios, los cuales al cierre
     de 2009 cayeron en 8.2% en relación a 2008, ampliando con ello el déficit fiscal.

     Bajo el escenario anterior, el Gobierno de El Salvador buscó adoptar varias acciones para abordar los
     impactos negativos provenientes del exterior, con la intención de promover el crecimiento económico
     desde una base amplia, y aumentar el espacio fiscal para incrementar las asignaciones presupuestarias
     en gasto de capital y gasto prioritario destinado a mejorar los indicadores sociales con estabilidad
     macroeconómica y sostenibilidad fiscal en el mediano y largo plazo.

     En este sentido, dadas las limitaciones fiscales a raíz de la crisis financiera internacional, el financiamiento
     con el Banco Mundial por $450.0 millones, denominado “Préstamo para Políticas de Desarrollo de las
     Finanzas Públicas y del Sector Social? fue oportuno para acelerar la ruta hacia un mayor crecimiento
     económico, estabilidad fiscal y la creación de nuevas y mejores oportunidades para las familias
     salvadoreñas, priorizando en programas sociales, incluido el fortalecimiento de la red de seguridad social
     orientada a proteger a los más vulnerables de la población.

B. Objetivo y resultados esperados

     El DPL fue diseñado con la finalidad de apoyar al Gobierno de El Salvador a fortalecer la sostenibilidad
     fiscal, la buena gobernabilidad, la transparencia en el uso de los recursos públicos, favoreciendo al
     aumento de la estabilidad macroeconómica y la eficiencia del sector público; en el área social, la mejora
     de la protección social y la educación, contribuyendo a ampliar la cobertura a los hogares con ingresos
     más bajos y expandir la enseñanza secundaria. Para tal propósito, el préstamo se estructuró sobre tres
     pilares, siendo éstos los siguientes: (i) Expansión del espacio fiscal para gastos prioritarios y mejorar la

                                                                25
  focalización del gasto público existente; (ii) Mejoramiento de la Administración del Gasto Público y la
  Transparencia Fiscal; y (iii) Expansión de Oportunidades para los Grupos Vulnerables.

  Los subcomponentes y correspondientes metas se detallan a continuación:

   Pilar I: Expansión del espacio fiscal para gastos prioritarios y mejora de la focalización del gasto
   público existente
   I.1 Ampliación del Espacio Fiscal
   Incremento de la recaudación de impuestos al 15.0% del PIB desde 14.1% del PIB en el 2007;
   I.2 Mejora de la focalización del gasto público existente
   Disminución del monto de los subsidios públicos no focalizados en 40.0% con respecto a julio de 2008;


   Pilar II: Mejorar la Administración del Gasto Público y la Transparencia Fiscal

   II.1 Modernización de la gestión de las finanzas públicas
   Preparación de un presupuesto multianual y la revisión de los procesos y el marco basado en resultados;
   II.2 Mejorar la Transparencia del Sector Público

   Información de las Finanzas Públicas y Ejecución Presupuestaria disponible en el Portal de
   Transparencia Fiscal;


   Pilar III: Expansión de Oportunidades para los Grupos Vulnerables

   III.1 Expansión de la cobertura de los programas de protección social
   Cobertura de 120,000 hogares por el programa de protección social y transferencias por US$27.0
   millones;
   III.2 Mejora en la calidad de la educación primaria
   Reducción en el número de escuelas que no presentan buen desempeño (según el resultado de las
   pruebas) de 8.0% en el 2007 a 5.0% en el 2011;
   III.3 Expansión del acceso de oportunidades a escuela secundaria
   Incremento en la matrícula de Educación Secundaria en cerca de 38,000 estudiantes.


C. Resultados finales y evaluación de las políticas

   Pilar I: Expansión del espacio fiscal para gastos prioritarios y mejora de la focalización del gasto
   público existente

   Al finalizar el año 2010, los Ingresos Tributarios registraron un incremento de 8.31%(US$235.8 millones)
   en relación al 2009, y respecto al PIB, el desempeño de la recaudación reflejó una mejora de 0.8 puntos,
   cerrando la carga tributaria en 14.5% desde 13.7% al final del año 2009. Entre las razones que justifican
   el incremento de la recaudación de impuestos, se pueden mencionar, la mejora en la eficiencia
   administrativa, producto de la reforma tributaria del año 2009, así como la moderada recuperación de la
   economía nacional.




                                                    26
    Al cierre del primer semestre de 2011, los ingresos tributarios alcanzaron un total de US$1,879.8 millones,
    reflejando una variación anual de 15.7% (US$254.4 millones) en relación al primer semestre de 2010, y
    con respecto a la meta del programa Stand-By, fueron superiores US$71.8 millones. Respecto al PIB, el
    desempeño de la recaudación mostró una mejora de 0.4 del PIB, al pasar de 7.7% en el primer semestre
    de 2010 a 8.1% en 2011. Se espera que al cierre de 2011, la carga tributaria alcance 15.4% del PIB.

    En relación a los subsidios públicos no focalizados, partiendo de la línea base real para el cierre del año
    2008 por un monto de $292.3 millones5, comprendiendo el subsidio al Gas Licuado ($136.8 mill.) y el
    subsidio a la energía eléctrica para consumo mayor a 99 kwh y no residencial ($155.5 mill.); al cierre del
    2010 el subsidio al GLP ($135.6 mill.) y a la energía eléctrica ($20.6 mill.) alcanzó $156.2 millones,
    registrando una disminución del 46.6% respecto al cierre de 2008. Lo anterior se explica principalmente
    por la completa eliminación al subsidio a la electricidad para la industria, lo cual se evidencia por medio
    del Decreto Ejecutivo No. 44, publicado en el Diario Oficial de fecha 26 de marzo de 2010, Tomo No. 386.
    Al mismo tiempo, el Gobierno mantiene el subsidio de forma indefinida a los consumidores de hasta 99
    kwh que representan cerca del 95% de los consumidores residenciales.

    En línea con los esfuerzos de focalizar los subsidios, a partir de abril 2011, el Gobierno inició con éxito la
    entrega del subsidio directo al GLP, comenzando con $8.50 por mes y familia, y a partir de mayo del
    mismo año se incrementó a $9.10 por mes y familia, incluyéndose sectores como escuelas saludables,
    comedores y otros. Con dicha focalización, se espera la creación de un espacio fiscal significativo en
    concepto de este subsidio, contribuyendo con ello al fortalecimiento de las finanzas públicas en un marco
    de disciplina y sostenibilidad fiscal de mediano plazo.

    Pilar II: Mejorar la Administración del Gasto Público y la Transparencia Fiscal

    En relación al marco basado en resultados, para el año 2010 se implantaron dos pilotos, en programas
    del MINSAL y MAG (para el año 2011 se agregaron programas adicionales), proyectando para el año
    2012, dos pilotos adicionales para Presupuestos por Resultados, en MINED y MARN. Adicionalmente, se
    está promoviendo la implementación de una nueva cultura presupuestaria a través de los Presupuestos
    por Resultados con Perspectiva de Género (PpRpG), tal como se concibe en el Plan Quinquenal de
    Desarrollo 2010-2014, la reducción de las desigualdades de género es una de las prioridades del actual
    Gobierno, por lo que ha iniciado un proceso de transversalización del enfoque de género en el diseño de
    las políticas públicas.

    Por otra parte, se cuenta con un Marco Fiscal de Mediano Plazo que tiene su fundamento en la
    evaluación del comportamiento de las distintas variables económicas y fiscales y se constituye en la
    herramienta fundamental para la formulación de la política fiscal, que se concreta en el Presupuesto
    General del Estado. El Marco Fiscal de Mediano Plazo, afirma las bases para la implementación de los
    Presupuestos Plurianuales, con el objetivo de disponer de herramientas de planificación y programación
    financiera, buscando evitar el aumento excesivo del gasto público y facilitar las reasignaciones en
    armonía con las prioridades estratégicas del estado.

    El propósito fundamental de contar con un Marco Fiscal de Mediano Plazo es disponer con una
    herramienta que permita tomar decisiones estratégicas sobre la orientación de la política fiscal, la forma
    en que ésta debe contribuir al logro de los objetivos del Estado y su impacto en el desempeño
    macroeconómico del país, generándose una previsión que contribuya a la toma de decisiones anticipadas
    de política económica en general.

  La línea base estimada para el cierre de 2008 ascendía a $325.0 millones, comprendiendo el subsidio al Gas Licuado ($150.0 mill.)
y el subsidio a la energía eléctrica ($175.0 mill.)




                                                               27
El Marco Fiscal de Mediano Plazo, se encuentra publicado en el sitio – Web del Ministerio de Hacienda.

Respecto a la población y grupos especializados interesados accediendo y analizando la información en
el Portal de Transparencia Fiscal, el número de accesos mensuales a dicho portal a partir de su creación
( 25 de octubre 2010) es de alrededor de 11,000 visitantes en promedio, y para fomentar su utilización se
dispone de un programa de divulgación para toda la población y grupos de interés, iniciando en el 2010
con funcionarios públicos, organismos internacionales, medios de comunicación, así como la creación de
alianzas con ONG´s, Universidades, entre otros. En el Portal de Transparencia, se publica la información
de ejecución presupuestaria, que incluye: Ingresos, Gastos, Financiamiento y Deuda de las instituciones
del Sector Público no Financiero.

Por su parte, el 92.0% de las adquisiciones del sector público fue registrada y publicada en
COMPRASAL, a mayo de 2011. En el período de junio a diciembre de 2010, se publicaron Planes de
Compras Institucionales en COMPRASAL, por un monto de US$357.0 millones y de adjudicación por
$381.3 millones; mientras tanto de enero a abril de 2011, se logró un nivel de publicación de Planes de
Compras Institucionales, por un monto de US$445.6 millones y de adjudicación por un monto de
US$189.7 millones. A la fecha se cuenta con la definición de las especificaciones técnicas y
requerimientos para el nuevo sistema de compras, que desarrollará nuevas funcionalidades y mejorará
algunas de las ya existentes, con un enfoque de fortalecimiento del sistema electrónico de compras
públicas, considerando entre otros los siguientes módulos: Plan de compras, proceso de libre gestión,
publicación de convocatorias (para todas las modalidades de compras), publicación de resultados (para
todas las modalidades de compras), reportes y estadísticas, registro de proveedores, notificaciones, entre
otras. Cabe mencionar, que como parte de las novedades de COMPRASAL para informar a la población
en general, se publica un ranking de Instituciones agrupadas por Gobierno Central, Autónomas,
Empresas Públicas, Hospitales y Municipalidades, jerarquizados por montos y por cantidad de procesos.

Pilar III: Expansión de Oportunidades para los Grupos Vulnerables

Respecto a la cantidad de hogares que están siendo cubiertos por el programa de protección social
Comunidades Solidarias, y el monto en concepto de transferencias, destaca que a diciembre de 2010
representó una cantidad de 98,074 hogares, y a junio de 2011 alcanzó 92,100 hogares; no obstante lo
anterior, se logró cubrir a más de 100,000 hogares, y por ajustes demográficos dicha cantidad de hogares
cubiertos por el programa registró una reducción en el año 2011; en relación al monto de transferencias
estas ascendieron a US$39.2 millones para el período junio 2009 – mayo 2010, registrando para el
período junio 2010 – mayo 2011 un monto de US$33.6 millones.

El Sistema de Protección Social, que incluye las CSU, es uno de los Programas clave dentro del Plan
Quinquenal de Desarrollo, considerado para enfrentar el problema estructural de la pobreza y la
desigualdad. Este Programa está basado en cuatro ejes de acción: capital humano, servicios básicos,
generación de ingreso y desarrollo productivo y gestión territorial. El primer eje incluye becas educativas,
la Pensión Básica Universal, atención en nutrición y salud, y prevención de la violencia; Asimismo, dentro
del eje de generación de empleo y desarrollo productivo se destaca el Programa de Apoyo Temporal al
Ingreso, mejor conocido como PATI, que consiste en un bono de US$100.0 dólares mensuales para
jóvenes y mujeres jefas de hogar, sin empleo, junto a capacitaciones para el empleo y el desarrollo
productivo (actividades pilotos de emprendedores en dos municipios), registrando para el primer semestre
de 2011 la participación de 10,000 mujeres y jóvenes. Se espera al final del Quinquenio completar 125
municipios en el programa Comunidades Solidarias a nivel nacional (100 pertenecientes a la zona rural, y
25 a la zona urbana).

En relación al número de escuelas que no tienen buen desempeño (según el resultado de la pruebas),
destaca que al cierre del año 2010 de un total de 410 Centros Educativos evaluados, 84 centros no
alcanzaron una nota mínima de 5 en la PAESITA, esto se explica principalmente por la carencia de
recursos (técnico, humano, tiempo) para contrarrestar las deficiencias en las escuelas y lograr mejores


                                                  28
   resultados; cabe mencionar que en el año 2007 se evaluaron estudiantes de 856 Centros Escolares, y
   para el año 2010 la evaluación se focalizó la muestra solamente en 410 Centros Educativos con mayor
   rezago educativo, por lo que el porcentaje de escuelas con rezago educativo resultó mayor. Entre las
   medidas que el Ministerio de Educación ha implementado para reforzar el nivel educativo en las escuelas,
   se tiene el programa “Escuela Inclusiva de Tiempo Pleno? (EITP), que se fundamenta en el marco del
   plan social educativo “Vamos a la Escuela?, y en el principio que un Centro Educativo ofrece a sus
   estudiantes variadas opciones educativas para el fortalecimiento de aprendizajes significativos y
   pertinentes en el ámbito académico, formativo y cultural, a partir de lo anterior, se destacan las principales
   acciones realizadas:

           Diseño de la fundamentación e implementación de la EITP, mediante talleres con directores y
            docentes de 22 centros escolares piloto distribuidos en todo el país.

           Diseño y preparación del proyecto de expansión de la EITP con estrategia de nuclearización del
            sistema escolar tradicional, junto a la implementación de proyecto piloto de nuclearización en 3
            municipios (Sonsonate, Nueva Granada y Zaragoza).

           Realización de estudio técnico que propone reorganización territorial beneficiando a 95 Centros
            Educativos, atendiendo a 27,000 estudiantes de educación básica (nuclearización).

   Por otra parte, para el año 2010 la matrícula de educación secundaria regular incluyendo el sector privado
   y el sector público, para tercer ciclo registró un incremento de 31,917 alumnos, en relación al año 2008 y
   para el nivel de bachillerato reflejó un aumento de 4,990 alumnos para el mismo período. Asimismo, la
   matrícula para el nivel de bachillerato bajo las Modalidades Flexibles de Educación - EDÚCAME
   (servicios educativos gratuitos a los jóvenes y adultos de 15 años de edad o más, que abandonaron sus
   estudios por diferentes circunstancias) para el año 2010, registró un incremento de 2,658 alumnos en
   comparación al año 2008, y para el nivel de tercer ciclo alcanzó la cifra de matrícula de 15,088 alumnos
   en el año 2010.

IV. Evaluación de políticas al mediano plazo

   El DPL citado en éste informe, fue diseñado para apoyar al Gobierno en el manejo del tema fiscal y
   finanzas públicas, al apoyo continuo institucional y a las reformas en el sector social. En este orden, entre
   las perspectivas del Gobierno para el período 2011-2014, en el tema de gestión financiera, se considera
   la realización de importantes proyectos orientados a mejorar la eficiencia de la gestión de las finanzas
   públicas y a generar mayor transparencia y predictibilidad de las decisiones de política fiscal en el
   mediano plazo. Entre los proyectos más relevantes a desarrollar en materia de gestión financiera se
   encuentran:
        - Ampliación de operaciones piloto de Presupuesto por Resultados.
        - Implementación de la estructura programática del presupuesto, con enfoque de presupuesto por
             resultados.
        - Diseño, formulación e implementación del Marco de Gasto de Mediano Plazo.
        - Adopción de un sistema presupuestario plurianual.
        - Integración de procesos y sistemas de la administración tributaria y aduanera.
        - Armonización e implementación de las Normas Internacionales de Contabilidad del Sector
             Público (NICSP).
        - Modernización del Sistema Administración Financiera Integrado.

   Por otra parte, El Gobierno de El Salvador, en cuanto a las reformas sociales, a través de la
   implementación del Sistema de Protección Social Universal y las políticas sociales estratégicas, esta
   avanzando de manera firme e ininterrumpida, bajo una visión de mediano y largo plazo, en la solución de
   los principales problemas sociales que afectan al país, especialmente la reducción de la pobreza, la
   inequidad de género y la exclusión social. En este sentido, algunas de las intervenciones mas importantes


                                                      29
   que el Gobierno mantiene y ampliará para los próximos años en los municipios de mayor índice de
   pobreza del país están: i) la pensión básica universal que se dirige a las personas adultas mayores de 70
   años de edad; ii) El Programa de Apoyo Temporal al Ingreso (PATI), dirigido de forma prioritaria a jóvenes
   de ambos sexos y mujeres jefas de hogar; iii) el programa de entrega de uniformes, zapatos, paquetes
   escolares, alimentación escolar, y el Plan “Vaso de leche?; iv) El mejoramiento integral de asentamientos
   urbanos precarios, así como el desarrollo de infraestructura social básica en los 100 municipios mas
   pobres del país (acceso a agua potable y energía eléctrica); y v) la entrega de bonos educación y salud,
   en municipios de pobreza extrema, severa y alta, entre otros.
   Lo anterior representa un fuerte compromiso del Gobierno a fin de asegurar la recuperación de la
   economía nacional y la superación de la exclusión social, lo que para el año 2012 se refleja en el
   presupuesto general de la nación en el que la mayor inversión está destinada a los programas sociales.


V. Conclusiones y lecciones aprendidas

   Tal como se expresó anteriormente, los recursos obtenidos a través del DPL fueron oportunos y
   apropiados para apoyar al Gobierno de El Salvador a fortalecer la sostenibilidad fiscal, la buena
   gobernabilidad, la transparencia en el uso de los recursos públicos, favoreciendo al aumento de la
   estabilidad macroeconómica y robustecer más la eficiencia del sector público; de igual manera, mantener
   constante la mejora de la protección social y la educación a los hogares con ingresos más bajos y
   expandir la enseñanza secundaria para cerrar las brechas de ingresos en el futuro, en un contexto donde
   las finanzas públicas se habían debilitado por los efectos de la crisis internacional y los logros sociales
   obtenidos previamente se veían amenazados.

   Por otra parte, una de las lecciones claves aprendidas es la importancia que los socios financieros,
   particularmente el Banco Mundial, tienen para apoyar oportunamente los esfuerzos del gobierno en
   circunstancias de shocks externos, por lo que con la experiencia exitosa del DPL en cuestión, el Gobierno
   de El Salvador reafirma su valoración positiva sobre la experiencia global que el Banco Mundial ofrece en
   diversos temas. En este mismo orden, con la experiencia del DPL, el Gobierno ratifica que las acciones
   de políticas han sido cumplidas previas a la formalización del financiamiento, contribuyendo con ello al
   rápido desembolso de los recursos y evitando recurrir a la dispensa de acciones que no pudieron
   cumplirse por diversas circunstancias.

   De igual forma, las políticas económicas y sociales del Gobierno han contribuido a superar los impactos
   de la crisis económica del 2008, considerando que la recuperación ha sido lenta durante el año 2011 y se
   espera que los indicadores sigan mejorando para 2012.

   Por último, el Gobierno está ahora más preparado para mitigar los riesgos con políticas públicas que
   amortiguan sus impactos sobre el crecimiento económico y social.
