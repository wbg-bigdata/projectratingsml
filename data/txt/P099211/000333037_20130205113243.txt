1. Introduction
       The objective of the project ― Rural distribution project‖ would enable the supply of
sufficient power of acceptable quality to the rural retail level. The project would focus on
rehabilitating and increasing the capacity of existing distribution lines and substations and
standardizing them to 110, 35 and 22kV to enable them to meet the growing demand more
efficiently, provide better quality and quantity of electric power for productive uses, and
reduce power system losses.
        The Subproject ― Tang Loong2 110kV Overhead line and Substation‖ that will be
located in Tang Loong town, Tang Loong district, Lao Cai province and will be invested in
order to meet the electricity demand of Lao Cai Province in the near future
      This document is prepared as required by the WB‘s OP4.10 policy on ethnic minorities
and policies on ethnic minorities of Vietnam Government. The Ethnic Minorities
Development Plan was developed and launched to ensure: (a) Protecting the tradition and
culture of ethnic minorities, (b) Minimizing the project‘s adverse impacts on ethnic
minorities, and (c) the ethnic minority groups shall be received with socio-economic benefits.
These guidelines aim at ensuring that the ethnic minorities are fully provided with
information, consulted and engaged into the Project performance survey. Their engagements
not only bring reliable benefits but also protect them against the Project‘s adverse impacts
during construction.


2.   Particulars about ethnic minorities in Lai Chau province

     With a population of about 1,200,000 inhabitants, the Tay is the largest group in the
community of ethnic minorities in Vietnam. Tay language belongs to the Tay-Thai Group.
        The Tay have other names such as Tho, Ngan, Phen, Thu Lao and Pa Di. The Tay
inhabits along the valleys and lower slopes of mountains in Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Thai,
Quang Ninh provinces and in some regions of Bac Giang province.
       The Tay preserves a traditional and fairly developed agriculture with a cultivation of
all kinds of plants including rice, maize, sweet potato, etc.and seasonable fruits and
vegetables.
        The Tay villages are always set up at the foot of a mountain or along a stream and are
named after a mountain, a field or a river. Each village contains about 15-20 households. A
large village is divided into many small hamlets. The houses are built on stilts or level with
the ground. The houses in frontier region are called defense houses which are often protected
against interlopers by a stone wall along with a ditch. The interior is divided into two rooms,
the front one reserve for men and the rear one serves as women's bedroom. The Tay clothes
are generally dyed with indigo. Women wear a below knee-length dress split at the right side
up to the armpit with five buttons and narrow sleeves.
        The Tay prefers sons to daughters. Prescriptions in relationship between members of
the family are obviously dictated. The couples live in harmony. Divorce is rare. Matrilocate
is no longer observed.
        Ancestor worship is the religious rite of the Tay. The ancestor altar is placed in a
central and grand place of the house. Strange guests are not allowed to sit on the bed in front
of the altar. Moreover, they ought to refrain from stepping on a fired firewood in the
kitchener or on the latter‘s side. Those who are back from a funeral ceremony abstain from
watching cattle and poultry if they have not taken a bath. After giving birth, the women are
not permitted to come near the ancestor altar.
        The Tay possess a rich traditional folklore with all kinds of poems, songs, dances,
music and puppetry also. Proverbs and folksongs are numerous. Tay folksongs have the turn
(a kind of duet between lovers), wedding songs and lullabies.

aged people. Once they have fraternized with other persons-they consider the laters their next
of kin.

        Majority land of ethnic minorities in the Project area is paddy field, land for forest,
hills and fruits. A minor part of the remaining is residential and garden land. Rice cultivation
and forestation are main agricultural activities of ethnic minority people in the Project area.
Ethnic minority farmers often hire ploughs and Paddy Threshers in the commune to plough
and pluck rice.
        They often put down microorganic fertilizer in the field. Garden land is used for a
series of purposes, including planting long-day crops in combination with short-day crops,
breeding cows, pigs, chicks and ducks. The cultivated land is often used to cultivate peanut,
corn, bean, sugar canes and pineapple.
3.     Policy Framework
        This plan is prepared in accordance with the WB‘s OP4.10 policy on ethnic minorities
and policies on ethnic minorities of Vietnam Government. According to the OP4.10: ―The
overall objectives of the Bank for ethnic minorities as well as for all residents of member
countries are to ensure that the development process fully respects dignity, human rights and
their cultural characters. Specifically, the key objective of this guideline is to ensure that the
ethnic minority is not to suffer from adverse impacts of development process, especially
impacts of the projects funded by WB and ensure that they shall enjoy fair socio-economic
benefits and cultural benefits‖. And ―WB‘s policy is that the strategy on handling ethnic
minority-related issues must be based on willingness of such ethnic minority groups.
Therefore, determining priorities of locality through direct consultation, integrating local
knowledge into project development and utilization right from the beginning by experienced
experts are the core activities of any project which may affect ethnic minorities and their
benefits for natural resources and economics."
        In the laws of Vietnam, equal rights of each person residing in Vietnam are confirmed
in the Legislation 1992. This is demonstrated in Article 5 of the Legislation: "The State of the
socialist republic of Vietnam is the united State of ethnic groups living in the territory of
Vietnam. The State takes the equal, solidarity and mutual supporting policies for ethnics,
prohibits all discrimination behaviors and scheme to drive a wedge between the peoples. The
peoples have the rights to use their voice, letter and maintaining national identity and develop
their good customs, traditions and culture. The State applies comprehensive development
policies, gradually improving the material and spiritual life for ethnic minority people.‖ Since
1968, the settlement policy has been promulgated for ethnic minorities to reduce migration
trends of the peoples. Recently, activities on supporting development of ethnic minorities are
increasingly concerned by the Government, especially programs/ policies such as:

4. The Project’s impacts on ethnic minorities and mitigation measures
        The Project‘s impacts are determined through consultation process with local persons
(including ethnic minority people) during preparation of project materials. In this sub-project,
the following impacts (both positive and negative) are determined:
       -   Supply and expansion improvement of power grid coverage in the area
       -   (Temporary or permanent) impacts on cultivated land during construction
       -   Impacts on crops
       -   Risks on power accidents
       Impacts on household level are insignificant and its impact coverage is not localized
in a certain area. At the community level, the local persons and authority expressed their
support towards project performance in the area.


4.1. The Project’s impacts
4.1.1. Temporary impacts on cultivated land


        Majority land of ethnic minority people in the Project area is paddy field, land for
forest, hills and fruits. Other lands are residential and garden types. Land area lost due to the
project‘s impact is insignificant compared with area of the DPs. The temporarily occupied
land during construction is available in two cases namely: When transporting columns and
materials into foundation position, foundation excavation and erection and stretching wire to
take sags. Total expected numbers of DPs are 130 households with 546 persons, concretely:

4.1.2. Temporary impacts on trees and crops


        Due to insignificant investment scale for each commune, works items can be shortly
launched from 3 – 6 months. Therefore, temporarily occupied impact is available during one
crop. In case it is possible to arrange the wiring progress right after the annual crops in routes

4.2. Mitigation Measures
4.2.1. Community consultation
       It is supposed to disseminate information and consult the DPs and ethnic minority
people in the project area as well as relevant agencies to minimize risks on conflict and risks
caused by the project. Accordingly, demand and necessity are investigated to offer the best
socio-economic benefits for the ethnic minority people.
       Objectives of the information dissemination strategy to the affected persons are as
follows:
        - To notify the target project, project scale and recommended activities to affected
          households and ethnic minority people.
        - To collect data on demand and priority of affected households and persons as
          well as their suggestions for the recommended policies and works.
        - To obtain the cooperation and engagement of affected households, persons and
          community in the task to be done to plan the ethnic minority development
Community Consultation and Information Dissemination strategy comprises of 2 phases
namely preparation of EMDP and performance of EMDP
a. The first phase

PROJECT: TANG LOONG2 110KV OVERHEAD LINE AND SUBSTATION
Report: Minorities Development Plan (EMDP)

-   Step 1: To propagandize and discuss with the local authority on wire lines and mitigation
    measures. This phase includes following activities: wire line selection, population survey
    and statistics of impacts on human beings, properties, acknowledgement of the project's
    mitigation strategy, compensation, rehabilitation and construction, consultation with DPs
    and ethnic minority people for EMDP.
-   Step 2: Statistics and survey on impacts: According to the route agreement, survey teams
    shall recognize the wire line position in cooperation with the local authority to prepare
    list of affected households regarding land, buildings and crops. The socio-economic
    formation surveys unveiled that 10% of households were affected. The statistics revealed
    all affected households.
-   Step 3: Meetings with local authority and affected households. The field workers in the
    survey team consult the local authority and households about the wire lines,
    disadvantage possibility of the project and recommendations on compensation unit price
    for buildings and structures, construction works and land. During launching the survey,
    the field workers should meet and discuss directly with households and ethnic minority
    people affected by the Project regarding compensation solutions, disadvantage
    possibility of the project and mitigation measures. Feedback should be concerned and
    mentioned in Report on EMDP. The Consultant also prepares the socio-economic survey
    forms and questionnaires about compensation of affected households. The local authority
    also engages in consultation about advantages of land in case of using public land for
    compensation. NPC held meetings with local authorities of all concerned provinces,
    districts and communes in the Project area. In such meeting, NPC requested affected
    households, ethnic minority people and representatives of local authorities to discuss and
    release opinion about the Project‘s solutions, mitigation measures and draft of EMDP‘s
    policies. Representatives of Women Association, Farmer Association, Department of
    Natural Resources and Environment, affected households and local authorities
    participated in such meetings.
       The draft of EMDP was also submitted to the competent agencies of the Provincial
People‘s Committees and WB‘s representative offices in Vietnam. The final report on EMDP
was also re-submitted to the PPC and WB‘s representative offices in Vietnam.
b. The second phase


-   Step 1: Information dissemination to ethnic minority people Information is distributed to
    the ethnic minority people in the Project Site.
-   Step 2: Community consultation on EMDP‘s activities, training and training programs.
    In the consultation meetings, affected households can release opinions on activities. Set
    activities for the benefits of ethnic minority people should be recorded. Moreover, DPs
    should be notified about time, venue and process of activities in EMDP. Ethnic minority
    people should be consulted about training programs and other programs such as training
    solutions, time and forms, which they may need. The consultation meetings should be
    attended by the native persons and translated into their native languages.
-   Step 3 – the second phase: Information on EMDP performance process for the local
    authorities. The communal authorities and affected ethnic minority people shall be
    notified about construction process and procedures as well as procedures of EMDP by
    NPC. The communal authorities and the district People‘s Committee must ensure that
    the affected ethnic minority households in the Project area acquire information about
    EMDP and project performance process.

                                     SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1. Availability, depth and required analysis category to launch social impact assessment should
correspond to the nature and scale of the Project‘s potential impacts on ethnic minority people to
see whether it is positive or negative.
2. The social impact assessment includes following factors:
(a) Consider the Project‘s scale, legislative framework and laws applied for ethnic minorities
(b) Collect background information about demography, society, culture and politics of the affected
ethnic minority communities, their land, which is under their long-time ownership, use or general
occupation, and natural resources, which they depend on.
(c) Consider and concern about background information, identification of the Project's main players
and careful composition of cultural formation process to consult the ethnic minorities in each
project preparation and implementation period.
(d) Evaluate the potential impacts and positive impacts of the project based on freedom, preferences
and consultation with the affected ethnic minority community. Evaluation of potential adverse
impacts refers to analysis of relevant vulnerability and risks on affected ethnic minority community
to release difference cases and close relation between land and natural resources as well as
settlement of opportunity insufficiency relating to other social groups in the community, area or
society in the country where they reside.
(e) It is necessary to identify and evaluate the methods based on freedom, preferences and
consultation with the affected ethnic minority community to avoid adverse impacts or if such
methods are not feasible, identification of method shall minimize or compensate for such impacts
and ensure that the ethnic minority groups receive cultural- corresponding benefits under the
Project.

                                               Introduction


1.       The Second Rural Energy Project (REII, P074688, Cr. 4000 VN) consists of (a)
upgrading and /or expansion of rural power networks in about 1,200 communes; (b)
conversion of current ad-hoc local electricity management systems to local distribution
utilities (LDUs) as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese law; and (c) capacity building
assistance for the LDUs, provincial national authorities, participating regional power
companies, and national authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural
electrification.


2.     RE II has been implemented since 2004 and is ongoing. Additional financing is
required to allow: (a) completion of the original project activities. Subprojects to electrify
about 968 communes are under way. To complete these and to add a further 232 and hence
achieve the original objective of 1,200 communes, an estimated additional $90 million is
required; and (b) implementation of additional activities that will scale up the project's impact
and development effectiveness. Since implementation has been satisfactory, and the
mechanisms and institutions are in place, it will be relatively easy to add a further 300
communes and raise the number of communes covered to 1,500 for which an estimated $110
million is required.


3.      The project consists of five components. One supports the rehabilitation, expansion
or both of low voltage (LV) rural networks in about 1,500 communes throughout Vietnam.
The component is currently implemented by 25 Provincial People's Committees (PPCs) and
the distribution system operators, called local distribution utilities (LDUs) of which there are
several hundred involved in the project. Three further components are broadly similar,
aiming to rehabilitate, expand or both, the medium voltage (MV) systems supplying the
upgraded communes in the Northern, Southern and Central regions of the country. Each is
implemented by the power company (PC) that is responsible for the MV system in that part
of the country. The fifth is a component aimed at developing policies and regulations and
building capacity, to ensure the financial, commercial and technical management of the
LDUs is as efficient as possible, and is implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Trade
(MoIT).


4.      Review of the ethnic minorities safeguard issues of the parent project has been
conducted as part of the preparation for the additional financing. Findings from the review
and lessons learnt during the preparation of similar projects (e.g. the Rural Distribution
Project), and the replacement of the World Bank's OD 4.20 by Operational Policy (OP) 4.10
has been taken into account in this updated Strategy for Ethnic Minorities. This updated
guideline applies to all subprojects for which an Ethnic Minorities Development Plan has not
yet been approved by the relevant Vietnamese authorities and cleared by the World Bank.


5.      For the subprojects to be located in areas where Ethnic Minorities are
present/residing, every effort will be made through design, construction measures, and
construction schedules to reduce adverse impacts on Ethnic Minoritie communities. For the
rehabilitation/expansion of the Medium Voltage system, the adverse impacts would be on

individual households and at low-intensity, most impacts on land of Ethnic Minorities will be
temporary, although some families of Ethnic Minorities will have land permanently acquired
from them for constructing of towers/poles and substations. Thus, the project subcomponents
would not cause any culturally specific impact on the affected ethnic minority community
and the nature of the impacts does not result in community-wide socio-economic effects.


6.     Sub-projects may be implemented in Provinces, Districts and Communes where
ethnic minority people are present as part of the population. In line with the World Bank‘s
Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10), an Indigenous Peoples Plan, hereafter
called Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDPs), will be developed for areas that have
ethnic minority households according to this strategy for ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities
are social groups with a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that
may make them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process. According to
OP 4.10 ethnic minorities can be identified in particular geographical areas by the presence in
varying degrees of the following characteristics:


           (a)     A close attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural resources in these
           areas;
           (b)     Self-identification and identification by others as members of a distinct
           cultural group;
           (c)     An indigenous language, often different from the national language;
           (d)     Presence of customary social and political institutions; and

7.      The purpose of this strategy is to ensure that the development process foster full
respect for the dignity, human rights, and cultural uniqueness of Ethnic Minority People.
More specifically, the objective of this strategy is to ensure that EM do not suffer adverse
effects during the development process and that they will receive culturally compatible social
and economic benefits.
                 Ethnic Minorities in Viet Nam1


8.     Ethnic Vietnamese, known as Kinh, with about 85 Percent of total population,
dominate the political, economic, and social affairs of the socialist Republic of Viet Nam.
There are officially another 53 ethnic groups in Viet Nam who constitute the category of
ethnic minorities. Most of ethnic minorities population live in the uplands. Population of
ethnic minority groups range from over a million to only a few hundred. The only ethnic
minority groups who live mainly in the lowlands are Hoa (Chinese), Cham and Khmer.


9.     Ethnic minorities in Viet Nam are diverse origin. A majority (39) as well as Kinh
speak languages in the Austro-Asiatic language family. But others speak Austronesian and
Sino-Tibetan languages. They differ greatly in ways of livelihood and social organization.
Some have had relationship with Kinh society for a long time, while others have lived in

relative isolation until recent decades. Some groups have lived in their present locations for
many centuries, while others have migrated into their present location within the past
hundred years.


10.     In the past fifty years, many ethnic minorities communities have shifted residence
because of war, governmental settlement programs, or a depleted resource base. As many as
five million Kinh have been relocated from the lowlands into upland areas. The biophysical,
social, and political context of the lives for most ethnic minorities has changed drastically in
the past fifty years.


11.    Equality right of ethnic people was stipulated clearly in the Vietnam Law. Article 5 in
the Vietnam Constitution (1992) stipulated as follows: The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a
united nation having many nationalities. The State implements a policy of equality and unity
and supports the cultures of all nationalities and prohibits discrimination and separation.
Each nationality has the right to use its own language and characters to preserve their
culture and to improve its own traditions and customs. The State carries out a policy to
develop thoroughly and gradually improve the quality of life of ethnic minorities in Vietnam
physically and culturally.


12.     Ethnic minorities in Vietnam have enjoyed better legal and political status than
minority groups in many other countries in the region, or around the world. They have
received many benefits as a result of government policies. They have received preferential
treatment in college admission processes. Cooking oil, kerosene, and iodized salt have been
provided to them at heavily subsidized rates. The government, foreign donor agencies, and
many NGOs have organized numerous development and special assistance programs that
targeted ethnic minorities. Very large sums of money have been invested with the intention
of helping the uplands in general and ethnic minorities in particular to ―catch up‖ with
lowland areas.


13.     While many—probably most—ethnic minority households have better material
standards of living today than they did ten or fifteen years ago, they are still not catching up
with the rest of the country economically. Indeed, they are in many ways falling further
behind. There are many reasons for the poverty of ethnic minority groups in Vietnam. The
peoples are struggling to adapt to severe stresses placed upon them from population pressure,
resource depletion, and cultural dislocation resulting from decades of externally imposed
change. Development of the region must concentrate on promoting the process of adaptive
change, recognizing that it must be accomplished by the people themselves, and that they will
inevitably have to devise many different ways of doing it.
            THE PLANNING FRAMEWORK
14.     The main objective of the ethnic minority planning framework is to ensure that the
development process, supported by the project, fosters full respect for the dignity, human
rights, and cultural uniqueness of ethnic minorities. This is achieved by avoiding adverse
impacts during the development process, and that they will receive culturally-compatible
social and economic benefits. The Bank's OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples indicates that the
strategy for addressing the issues pertaining to indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities must be

THANG LONG POWER DEVELOPMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY                                   36
PROJECT: TANG LOONG2 110KV OVERHEAD LINE AND SUBSTATION
Report: Minorities Development Plan (EMDP)

based on a process of ‗free, prior, and informed consultation‘, resulting in ‗broad community
support‘ by the ethnic minority communities for the project, if the sub-project is to proceed.
Thus, identifying local preferences through direct consultation, incorporation of indigenous
knowledge into project approaches, and appropriate early use of experienced specialists are
core activities for any project that affects Ethnic Minority Peoples and their rights to national
identity and natural and economic resources.


15.     The State of Viet Nam has the policy of not discriminating against Ethnic Minority
Peoples as showed by the presence of Ethnic People Council in the National Assembly and
Ethnic People Committee in the Government . Article 94 in the Constitution, 1992 states that
the Ethnic People Committee has the right to submit proposals, plans or related issues of
indigenous peoples to the Assembly, monitor, control the implementation of national
policies, development programs on various areas such as, education, health care, etc. Article
5 of the Constitution also indicates that ethnic minority people could use their own languages
to reserve its cultural distinctions. In the Government of Viet Nam, directly under the
supervision of the Prime Minister is the Committee of Ethnic Minorities (which is equivalent
to a Ministry). Development programs are supervised by this Committee, such as the poverty
reduction Program 135 according to the degree No, 135/1998/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister
to promote the construction of small-scale infrastructure in poor ethnic minority villages.


16.    According to the Government of Viet Nam, ethnic minorities have the following
characteristics:
        An intimate understanding and long stay in the territory, land or area of their
         ancestors closed attachment to the natural resources;
        Self-identification and recognized by neighboring members by their distinctive
         culture
        A language different from the national language
        A long traditional social and institutional system
        A self-provided production system.


            17.             This Planning Framework will be applied to all sub-projects of the
                            Rural Energy Project no.2.
            Guidelines for Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMPD)
18.     The Planning Framework seeks to ensure that ethnic minority communities
(villages/hamlets) are fully informed about sub-project plans and consulted about potential
benefits and adverse impacts the sub-project may have on the community. This consultation
will be done in a setting free of coercion, before any sub-project is initiated (free, prior, and
informed consultation). If this process results in the community‘s broad support for the
project the sub-projects will be considered to be supported by Rural Energy No. 2 Project.
Their participation can either provide them benefits with more certainty, or protect them from
any potential adverse impacts of sub-projects to be financed by the Project. The main
features/process of the EMDP will be a preliminary screening process, then a social impact
assessment to determine the degree and nature of impact of each work under the sub-project,

PROJECT: TANG LOONG2 110KV OVERHEAD LINE AND SUBSTATION
Report: Minorities Development Plan (EMDP)

and an action plan will be developed if warranted. Consultations with and participation of
the minority population, their leaders and local government officials will be an integral part
of the overall EMDP, and continue throughout the project.


19. Detailed instruments for screening and social impact assessment are described in the
annexes. In addition, the Project will provide a series of training to all implementers and local
agencies preparing and implementing EMDPs.
             Screening
20.     All communes, which have ethnic minority communities/villages and are candidates
for sub-Project will be visited (at the time of first consultation with communes) by PCs,
relevant local authorities and consultants. Prior to the visit, respective PCs will send a letters
to the communes informing the commune leaders that they will be visited by the respective
PCs and local authorities to discuss about possibility of the sub-project. The letter will
request that the commune invite to the meeting representatives of farmers and women
associations, village leaders, and key staff of commune for discussion on the sub-project.
During the visit, the commune leaders and other participants will present their views with
regards to the sub-project.


21.    At this visit, the social scientists (consultants) and local Women‘s Union will
undertake a screening for ethnic minority population with the help of ethnic minority leaders
and local authorities. The screening will check for the following:


       (a)    Names of ethnic groups in the commune
       (b)    Total number of different ethnic minority groups in the commune
       (c)    Percentage of ethnic minority of commune population
       (d)    Number and percentage of ethnic minority households along the zone of
              influence of the proposed sub-Project.


22.    If the results show that there are ethnic minority communities in the zone of influence
of the proposed sub-project, a social impact assessment and further consultations will be
planned for those areas.
             Social Impact Assessment AND CONSULTATION
23.     The social impact assessment (SIA) and the free, prior, and informed consultation will
be undertaken/facilitated by the social scientists (consultants) together with trained staff from
the local Women‘s Union and ethnic minority leaders. The SIA will gather relevant
information on the following: demographic data; social, cultural and economic situation; and
social, cultural and economic impacts - positive and negative. The consultation process will
determine whether there is broad support from the community for the sub-project.


24.    Information regarding the sub-project proposal will be widely disseminated and
consultation will be conducted in various group meetings: ethnic minority leaders; ethnic
minority men; and ethnic minority women, especially those who live in the zone of influence

THANG LONG POWER DEVELOPMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY                                     38
PROJECT: TANG LOONG2 110KV OVERHEAD LINE AND SUBSTATION
Report: Minorities Development Plan (EMDP)

of the proposed work under sub-Project. Discussions will focus on sub-Project impacts,
positive and negative; and recommendations for design of sub-Project. The local Women‘s
Union will, under the guidance of the consultant, be responsible for analyzing the SIA, and
for leading the development of an action plan with the ethnic minority representatives and
Project staff. If the SIA indicates that the potential impact of the proposed sub-project will be
significantly adverse or that the ethnic minority community rejects the project, the sub-
Project will not be implemented in that locality; no further action is needed in this case.


25.    If the ethnic minority supports the sub-Project implementation an EMDP will be
developed.
            Ethnic Minority Development Plan
26.     The action plan will consists of a number of activities and will include mitigation
measures of potentially negative impacts, modification of sub-project design, and
development assistance. Where there is land acquisition in ethnic minority communities, the
project will ensure that their rights will not be violated and that they be compensated for the
use of any part of their land in a manner that is culturally acceptable to them. The
compensation and rehabilitation will follow the Resettlement Policy Framework of the
project. An Ethnic Minorities Development Plan will include:


   (1)   Legal Framework
   (2)   Baseline data;
   (3)   Land tenure information;
   (4)   Local participation;
   (5)   Technical identification of development or mitigation activities;
   (6)   Institutional arrangement;
   (7)   Implementation schedule;
   (8)   Monitoring and evaluation; and
   (9)   Cost and financing plan.
            Implementation Arrangement
27.    Consultants will also be responsible for training respective PCs, local Women‘s
Union or a similar social organization to undertake the work of consultation, screening, social
impact assessment, analyses and preparing EMDPs.


28.    PCs of the EVN, together with local authorities (People‘s Committees, Committees
for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas, Resettlement Committees, Women Union and
Land Departments etc. at different levels) are responsible for implementing EMDP (arrange
adequate staff and budget).
            Monitoring
29.   Implementation of the EMDPs will be regularly supervised and monitored by PCs of
EVN and respective Peoples' Committees and Committees for Ethnic Minorities at provincial

and district levels. The findings and recommendations will be recorded in quarterly reports and
to be furnished to EVN and World Bank office in Viet Nam.


30.     The independent agency or agencies which would be used by PCs to undertake
external monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of resettlement action plans for the
Project will also be tasked with monitoring the activities for EMDP. the external monitoring
agency will visit a sample of affected households in each relevant province on an annual
basis.
            Schedule
31.     The EMDP will have an implementation schedule that is coordinated with the sub-
project implementation. The social impact assessments, consultation, and group meetings
will be undertaken before sub-project final designs are prepared. Compensation for land
acquisition should be satisfactorily completed at least one month prior to start of civil work.
Monitoring should take place at the recommended times during project implementation.
            Budget
32.    The EMDP, while supporting and providing development activities, will include
information on detailed cost of mitigation measures and other rehabilitation entitlements for
ethnic minority in the affected areas. Sources of funding for the various activities and
financing plans will be clearly specified in the cost tables.
            Reporting/Documentation
33.     The EMDPs will be prepared and submitted by PCs to EVN and then the World Bank
at the same time that respective PCs submit their annual work programs to EVN and the
World Bank for review. When EVN submit the final annual work programs of all the
provinces to the World Bank for approval, an integrated EMDP report for the provinces will
also be furnished, documenting the social impact assessment, the process of free, prior, and
informed consultation, and the evidence, if any, of broad community support.

Annex 3: Proposed Action Plan




When to prepare action plan: Immediately after the SIA, if the ethnic minority supports
for the sub-project.
How to prepare an action plan: The plan to be prepared based on the results of
consultation and participation of EM groups.
What is in an action plan: It will consist of (1) legal framework (2) mitigation activities;
(3) technical identification of development, (4) institutional arrangement for
implementation; (5) implementation schedule; (6) monitoring and evaluation; and (7) cost
and financing plan.
Who will prepare the action plan: Consultant in coordination with the commune leaders,
ethinic minority leaders in consultation with the EM community and the trained local
staff from the district.
Who will implement the action plan: The PCs and PMBs under EVN, Communes and
EM leaders




1. Legal Framework: Describe the laws of GOV applied and OD 4.20 of the World Bank.
2. Mitigation Measures


Potential of negative impacts: Identification of potentially negative impacts through
consultation with EM and local authorities.


   Mitigation measures


   Information from the SIA and meetings with the ethnic minority communities will be
   used by the Project Engineer in preparing the design, construction schedule and
   construction measures for the subprojects and the estimated cost of required work. These
   will include:


       a. Recommendations for changing line alignments, locations, construction measures
          and construction schedule for subprojects to accommodate needs and preferences
          of ethnic minorities:

       c. Develop a program for communication, information and education by the
          commune for the ethnic minority community in the zone of influence on electric
          safety, potential health and social problems.

       d. Land acquisition and compensation: Where there is land acquisition in ethnic
          minorities, the project will ensure that their rights will not be violated and that
          they will be compensated for the use of any part of their land in a manner that is
          culturally acceptable to them. The compensation will follow the Resettlement
          Policy for Project Affected Person under the Project. Ethnic minority leaders will
          assist with consultation of affected households and with compensation activities.


   23. Technical Identification of Development Assistance


   The province through its regular development program will provide assistance to the
   ethnic minorities living in the sub-project areas, e.g., priority for those living near the
   influenced areas in getting employment in subproject construction and maintenance.
   Priority for accessing to credits of Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development in
   medium and long terms. Assistance for agricultural development such as land
   reclamation,. Where the areas overlap with other World Bank financed projects, ethnic
   minority areas will be targeted wherever possible.


   Training: The Project will provide trainings for EM in the influenced areas on training
   on electric safety, agricultural extension. It will also include ethnic minority leaders in
   training sessions on SIA, resettlement, and participatory monitoring for EMDP
   implementation.


   Gender Assistance: Special consultation and training for women, especially female-
   headed households (such as, credit, agricultural extension, fertilizer use, etc.)
