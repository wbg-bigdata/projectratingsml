         EXAMPLE ENVIRONMENTAL TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR SIMC


The Safeguard Independent Monitoring Consultant shall:


1. Visually look at the construction sites and make notes related to the following
   environmental issues, but not limited to:
   General clean up after construction works,
   Excessive clear cutting of trees beyond ROW in communal or forest land,
   Measures taken by the contractor for cleaning up woody residues after tree cutting
   Status of access roads (have they been closed if in a protected area, are they still being
    used and to what extent, how are they being controlled/managed and by whom),
    Application of mitigation measures for or sign of soil erosion along T/L due to tree
    cutting and/or around tower foundation
   Status of re-vegetation in the ROWs and tower foundation
   Impacts on construction works (level of noise, dust, and damage to roads due to
    earthworks and transportation of building materials)
   Status of construction worker camps and sanitation facilities for them
   Proper distance between the houses and T/L,
   Status of implementation of safety measures (signboards, restricted zone, fences, isolation
    etc.)


2. Conduct public consultation to:
   Assess the level of involvement by the local authorities in dealing with environmental
    issues (dust, noise, and damage to roads due to the transport of construction materials,
    tree cutting on public lands and protected areas).
   Identify any other environmental issues and record environmental complaints from the
    PAHs.
   Report on responses (if any) from appropriate local authorities on environmental
    complaints or non-compliance
