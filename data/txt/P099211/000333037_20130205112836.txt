      Noise and vibration                                - Noise and vibration are caused by: equipment, material transportation,
                                                         project's vehicles, pole's erection and cable's pulling, generators (if there is
                                                         any);
                                                         - The substation is located on rarely house and population, effection of noise
                                                         and vibration is very low.
                                                         The equipments which will be used in project, responseto the Viet Nam

                                                         greater, The noise is negligible.
                                                          - Construction machinery shall carry out construction & installation works
                                                         at site during a short duration and there are no population in construction site
                                                         area.
                                                         By above reasons noises and vibrations induced by the project are considered
                                                         as small impacts

                                                         - Vegetation area is reduced due to site clearance for safety corridor and
                                                         construction of temporary road.
8                                                        - Potential of soil erosion is low due to the facts that Project activities are
                                                         limited, duration of construction work is short, and affected area is small.
                                                         Furthermore, these impacts will be reduced by implementation of mitigation
                                                         measures.

                                                         will cause the dust and air pollution as well; But trucks for material need to
                                                         be covered during transportation;
                                                         - Project is carried out far from residential and urban areas, so air pollution
                                                         will not much affect the human living in the Project area.

                                                         activities will disturb the normal traffic in the areas during short period of
                                                         time; Wire tension will cross railway for coal transportation (However, this
                                                         railway was no longer in operation).
                                                         - In open air area, the transportation of material and equipment is very easy
                                                         due to very well developed road system in the Project sites.

Recommendations
   Construction activities near the hospital must be limited with working hours from 07:00 to
    11:00 in the morning and from 14:00- 17:00 in the afternoon. The period from 11:00 to 14:00
    is the tea break of officials and patients to be kept quiet.
   More attention should be made when clearing construction camps
   The Contractor must ensure to store columns and construction waste at required places
   It is required to fully provide the safety equipment and training programs to workers to
    minimize labor accidents, etc, especially for local workers because they neglect about labor
    safety.
