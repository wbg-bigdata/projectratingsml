2.1. DETERMINING OF THE SUB-PROJECT IMPACT
Determine the project areas:
The affected areas of the subproject only include:
   - The area at substation construction: 3,500 m2 (the area inside the campus of sustation)
   - The area at foundation construction: 144m2
   - The area around the construction site of pole foundation during the construction, the
     temporarily affected area on the line pulling route – 14m wide on average – the route is
     only calculated for crop cultivation. The land area may be affected from one to two
     months
The Project does not mean making temporary service road because it was built with good quality,
very convenient, so land acquisition is not required for this item.
Determine DPs
According to survey result, there are 03 DPss (11 people), in which, the households that have
acquired land ratio from 2% to 5% as follow:
      DPs have cultivated land, be affected partly or entirely (temporarily or permanently);
      DPs have perennials that be affected partly or entirely (temporarily or permanently);
      Vulnerable group is affected in the subproject: None

3.1.2. World Bank policies (WB)
       The legal framework governing the implementation of this Policy Framework and the
       Inventories and RP are OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement of the World Bank.


       Involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12)
       The primary objective of the World Bank policy is to explore all alternatives to avoid
       or at least minimize involuntary resettlement. Where resettlement is unavoidable, the
       living standards of displaced persons should de restored or improved relative to those
       conditions that prevailed prior to the project. The policy applies to the taking of land
       and other assets when land acquisition results in the loss if shelter, the loss of all or
       part of productive assets, or access to them and loss of income sources or other means
       of livelihood.
       According to the OP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement, DPs shall be compensated and
       assisted in such a way as to warrant the improvement or at least the maintenance of
       pre-project living standard condition.
       Measures required to ensure that resettlement has a positive outcome include:
          Consulting with potential displaced persons on feasible measures for resettlement
           and rehabilitation ;
          Providing DPs with options for resettlement and rehabilitation;
          Enabling their participation in planning and selecting these options;
          Providing compensation at full replacement cost for losses;
          Choosing relocation sites that at least guarantee the same benefits and services as
           the sites they replace;
          Providing allowances, training ans income support to assist in making a smooth
           transition;
          Identifying valnerble groups and providing special assistance to these groups and;
          Establishing an institutional and organizational structure that supports this process
           to a successful end.
       The Eligibility Criteria and Compensation defines that the DPs eligible for
       compensation include: (a) Those who have formal legal rights to land or other assets;
       (b) Those who initially do not have formal legal rights to land or other assets but have
       acclaim to legal rights based upon the laws of the country; upon the possession of
       documents such as land tax receipts and residence certificates; upon the permission of
       local authorities to occupy or use the project affected plots; and
        (c) Those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land thy are
       occupying.



                                                                                        Page 16
        DPs whose houses are in part or in total affected (temporarily or permanently) by the
        project and whose houses are in part or in total affected (temporarily or permanently)
        by the project or whose residential and premise and /or agricultural land is in part or
        in total affected (temporarily or permanently) by the project are provided
        compensation for the land they lose, and other assistance as necessary to achieve the
        objectives set out in this policy, if they occupy the project area prior to the cut-off-
        date defined in this RP.


        DPs whose business are affected in part or in part or in total(temporarily or
        permanently)by the project are provided resettlement assistance and other supports as
        necessary to achieve the objectives set out in this policy, if they occupy the project
        area prior to the cut-off-date defined in this RP.


        Persons who encroach on the areas after the cut-off-date defined in this RP are not
        entitled to compensation or any other form of resettlement assistance.


        The methodology to be used in the valuation of losses for this project is based on their
        replacement cost. In this project, losses comprise land, structures and other assets.
        Residential cost for land includes the value of land at market price plus the cost taxes
        and frees to get LURC. For houses and other structures, the market cost of the
        materials shall be used to calculate the replacement cost to build a replacement
        structure with an area and the quality should be at least as good as those affected. For
        both totally and partially affected structures, compensation includes market cost of
        material, plus the costs of materials transport, labor and contractor fees, and
        registration and transfer taxes.


        Depreciation of the asset and amount saved in material will not form apart of
        replacement cost.
3.2. Comparison between GOV and World Bank approaches
      There are many approaches of the Government of Vietnam – both policy and practice
– compatible with WB’s guidelines. The most important approaches are:
        Vietnam applies a procedure in which most of persons having no legal land use rights
       can also obtain the legalization and compensation for damages.
        Fixed residents are provided with solutions including removing to the improved
       resettlement area, compensating in cash or both.
        Resettlement areas not only have better infrastructure and service but also prove a
       higher living standard.
       Allowances facilitate DPs during their transition period and release a legislative
       mechanism, through that, the local people are informed and entitled to negotiate about
       compensation and make claims.
       Within the framework of this program, differences in approaches and measures must
       be specified. However, under this perspective, procedures of the central and local
       authorities enable to reject some articles in the country for some certain projects, which
       may conflict to the similar regulations of sponsors.


                                                                                         Page 17
        Regarding land ownership and legal rights to be compensated, approaches of the
       Government and WB are compatible. The Government applies procedures in which
       land occupation without legal papers can be legalized. However, this land is still
       compensated with 100% of land price deducting taxes/fees to legalize land use rights
       since 15th October 1993 (Sections 49 and 50 of Article 42 Law on Land in 2003).
        Compensation at the replacement price is specified in Article 6 of Decree No.
       197/2004/ND-CP dated 3rd December 2004, concretely: ‘…Person whose using land is
       reclaimed for any purpose shall be compensated by assigning new land with the same
       land use purpose; if no land is available for compensation, land use rights shall be
       compensated at the approval date of land recovery decision; in case of compensation by
       assigning new land or house, if difference is available, such difference shall be paid in
       cash; Article 19 of this Decree also specifies ‘….regarding houses and domestic works
       of households and individuals, it is compensated by new construction value of house
       and buildings with similar technical specifications …..’
3.3 Required waivers
In order to carry out the RP in accordance to World Bank PO/BP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement a number of articles in various Vietnamese laws and regulations which do not
ensure compensation at replacement cost or set eligibility provisions which do not extend the
right to compensation and rehabilitation to households to households without proper land
papers, will be waived i.e.:
Eligibility to Compensation and/or Assistance Decree 197/2004/ND-CP dt.Dec.03, 2004
Article 7
         This article (cases where land is recovered without compensation) stipulates that any
         person whose land is recovered and who has not met one of the conditions of Article
         8 of this Decree, or who has violated the plan, or who violates the protecting corridor
         work, or who illegally occupies land shall not receive compensation when the state
         recovers the land. In case of necessity, the Provincial People’s Committee shall
         conider and decides on a case – by – case basis.
Article 18,19 and 20:
               Houses and structures on non -eligible-for-compensation land, which have not
                violated announced land use plans or the right of way will not be assisted at
                80% of replacement cost.
               Houses and structures on non -eligible-for-compensation land, which have not
                violated announced land use plans or the right of way will not be assisted. If
                necessary, the PPC will consider on the case basis.
Article 28 and 29:
         DPs losing more than 10% of productive land will be entitled to living stabilization
         and training/job creation assistance
To ensure that the objectives of this resettlement policy are met, a special decision of the
Government waiving Article 7,18,19, 20, 28, 29 of Decree 197 is needed to permit assistance
and rehabilitation measures for illegal users of land as proposed in the policy.

According to the Vietnamese regulation the unit price for land compensation will be based on
GOV Decrees 197/2004/ND-CP and 188/2004/ND/Cp along with their Guidance (Circular
No.114/2004/TT- BTC and No.116/2004/TT-BTC respectively).

        adjustment when prevailing price of transfer of land use rights in the market in
        respect of a number or all types/categories of land listed in the land price framework
        continuously fluctuated (more than 60 days in many provinces, cities) that causes
        large differences in land prices (increasing from  30% compare to the max. price
        and decreasing from  30% compare to min. prices attached to this Decree).
Article 9

        provincial People’s Committee in line with the Government regulation (within the
        GOV’s range of minimum and maximum prices).
Decree 188/2004/ND-CP dt. Nov. 16, 2004
        This Decree promulgates the methodologies to define land price and, at the same
        time, set forth the land price framework (min. and max. unit price for various types of
        land) throughout the country
Article 2
        This article states that the land price shall be defined by the provincial People’s.
        Committees and/or cities directly under the central government.
To ensure that the objectives of the project resettlement policy are met, unit price for land
compensation established by the Project provincial/city People’s Committees will be adjusted
to meet the replacement costs.

                          4. COMPENSATION AND ALLOWANCE
4.1.    Compensation
Project cut-off date: The project cut-off date was decided when the survey and inventory of loss
was carried out, that is the 23th of April 2012. The project cut-off date was formally informed to
the local people by the local authorities in the first community meetings in each commune
affected.
Any people who encroached or moved to the project affected area after the cut-off date will not
entitle to any compensation or resettlement entitlement. They are requested to remove structures,
cut trees or harvest crops in order to clear and handle the land to the project, however, they will
not be compensated. The project cut-off date and the provision on ‘no compensation to
encroacher’ were clearly informed in the community meetings.
Replacement price: In respect with the sub-project, the losses are included only land and
perennial. The survey results show that the OHL and substation are constructed in the rural area
with most of land for plantinh perennial trees. Almost no commercial transaction of the
land/tree/crop is carried out in the area; a transfer, if any, only to be carried out by the relations,
among themselves. Basing on the local authorities (of Tang Loong town) recommendation, the
compensation price which is stipulated by the Lao Cai PPC shall be applied for losses of land,
tree, and crop. The compensation price was promulgated in the community consulting meeting
and accepted by the DPs.
    The applied compensation price in the RP is provisionally calculated by the tariff tables
  which established by the Lao Cai PPC; the tariff tables are mentioned in the following
  Decisions:
    - Decision No.45/2009/QD-UBND of People’s Committee of Lao Cai province dated
      12/05/2009 issuing regulations on compensation, support and resettlement for land
      clearance of the State under purposes of defense, security, national benefit, public
      interests, the aim of economic development in Lao Cai province (Appendices 2A, B,
      C, D and Appendix 3).

    It should be noted that unit prices of land in RP using for the estimating purpose
(during this RP preparation period). At the time of RP execution (expected 2012), land
compensation unit price will be updated to ensure that affected people will be
compensated at replacement cost for their losses.

6.2.    Independent monitoring
An independent agency or agencies or individual consultant will be retained by PCs of EVN
to periodically carry out external monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of RPs.
The independent agencies will be academic or research institutions, non-Governmental
Organizations (NGO) or independent consulting firms, all with qualified and experienced
staff and terms of reference acceptable to the World Bank. Independent monitoring begins
about the same time as implementation activities and continues until the end of
project/subproject. The independent monitoring agency will:


       Determine whether the procedures for DPs participation and delivery of compensation
        and other rehabilitation entitlements has been done in accordance with this Policy
        Framework; and
       Assess if the Policy Framework objective of enhancement or at least restoration of
        living standards and income levels of DPs have been met.
       Gather qualitative indications of the social and economic impact of Project
        implementation on the DPs.
       Suggest modification in the implementation procedures of s, as the case may be, to
        achieve the principles and objectives of this Policy Framework.
In addition to verifying the information furnished in the internal supervision and monitoring
reports of the respective PCs, the external monitoring agency will collect information from
affected households. Depending on the magnitude of project impact, borrower with
consultation from Task’s Team of the World Bank will decide the extent of using
independent monitoring consultant
.
6.3.    Reporting regulation
        Implementation of RPs will be periodically supervised and monitored by the respective
PC/its PMB in a close coordination with the respective Peoples' Committees at different
administrative units and independent monitoring agencies. The findings will be recorded in
quarterly reports to be furnished to EVN, PCs, Project Provincial Powers, and World Bank
       A Resettlement Plan cannot be considered complete until a completion audit or survey
confirms that all entitlements have been received by beneficiaries and livelihood restoration
is progressing on schedule. If possible, the (internal/external) monitoring activities of RPs
could be considered to be combined with similar action under Ethnic Minority Development
Plan of the same subproject.

A. The Project
1.       Objectives: The proposed development objective of the project is to improve
efficiency, availability and reliability of power supply and as well the efficiency of its
utilization. This would be achieved through (a) rehabilitation of the distribution system from
below 110 kV; and (b) modernization of the distribution system through introduction of smart
metering and smart grid technologies.

2.      Preliminary project description: The project activities will be rehabilitation and
expansion of power distribution system from 110 kV and down, including distribution line,
substations of 110 kV, 35 KV, 22kV, and to 0.4 kV.
3.      To implement subprojects components, land acquisition will be required. However,
rehabilitating and increasing the capacity of existing distribution lines and substations would
not cause large scale of land acquisition and resettlement. For the ownership and
implementation arrangements, separate Resettlement Plans (RPs) will be prepared prior to the
appraisal one for each participating PC.


B.     Policy Framework
4.     This resettlement policy framework prepared based on the OP/BP 4.12 of the World
Bank on involuntary resettlement (December, 2001). The principle objective of the Policy
Framework is to ensure that all displaced persons (DP's) 1 will be compensated for their
losses at replacement cost 2 and provided with rehabilitation measures to assist them to
improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards and income earning capacity.


5.      The Policy Framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of
DP's, entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and
rehabilitation, peoples participation features and grievances procedures that will guide the
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the DP's.


C.     The Displaced Persons (DPs)
6.      The DP's include the following persons to be identified by the baseline information
collected for each Resettlement Plans (RPs):
(a)    persons whose houses are in part or in total affected (temporarily or permanently) by the
       project;
(b)    persons whose residential and premise and/or agricultural land is in part or in total
       affected (permanently or temporarily) by the project;
(c)    persons whose businesses are affected in part or in total (temporarily or permanently) by
       the project; and
(d)    persons whose crops (annual and perennial) and trees are affected in part or in total by
       the Project.
D.     Principles and Objectives
7.     The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Policies 4.12 (OP/BP 4.12)
have been adopted in preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard the following principles
and objectives would be applied:
(a)   Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized as
      much as possible.
(b)   All DP's residing, working, doing business or cultivating land in right of way (ROW)
      of transmission line (T/L), surrounding areas of tower foundation, the substation areas,
      in the service roads under the project as of the date of the baseline surveys are entitled
      to be provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at
      least maintain their pre-project living standards, income earning capacity and
      production levels. Lack of legal rights to the assets lost should not bar the DP from
      entitlement to such rehabilitation measures.
(c)   The rehabilitation measures to be provided are: (i) compensation at replacement cost,
      without deduction for depreciation or salvage materials for houses and other structures;
      (ii) agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity acceptable to the DPs or in
      cash at replacement cost according to DP’s choice ; (iii) replacement of
      residential/premise land of equal size acceptable to the DP or in cash at replacement cost
      according to DP’s choice; and (iv) transfer and subsistence allowances.
(d)   Replacement residential and agricultural land will be as nearby as possible to the land
      that was lost, and acceptable to the DPs.
(e)   The resettlement transition period will be minimized and the rehabilitation means will be
      provided to the DP's prior to the expected start-up date of works in the respective project
      sites.
(f)   Plans for acquisition of land and other assets and provision of rehabilitation measures
      will be carried out in consultation with the DPs, to ensure minimal disturbance.
      Entitlements will be provided by DPs prior to expected start-up of works at the
      respective project site.
(g)   The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained or improved.
(h)   Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be made
      available and as where and when required.
(i)   Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning, consultation
      and implementation of RPs.
Effective and timely supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of RPs will
be carried out.
E. Resettlement Plan (RP)
8.    The scope and level of detail of the resettlement plan vary with the magnitude and
complexity of resettlement.
       Abbreviated    Resettlement Plan
9.      In case impacts on the entire displaced population are minor, 3 or fewer than 200
people are displaced, an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan (ARP) will be prepared by the
respective PCs (under EVN) and consolidated by the project provinces for any given project
phase and furnished to the World Bank for its concurrence.


10.    Each Abbreviated Resettlement Plan will cover the following minimum elements: (1) a
census survey of displaced persons, and valuation of assets; (2) description of compensation
and other resettlement assistance to be provided: (3) consultation with displaced persons about
acceptable alternatives; (4) institutional responsibility for implementation and procedures for
grievances redress; and (5) a timetable and budget. In the case some displaced persons, lose
more than 10% of their productive assets or require physical relocation, the plan also covers a
socioeconomic survey and income restoration measures.
11.     The Abbreviated Resettlement Plan will be completed by no later than four months
prior to the estimated date for commencement of the works under the project phases. Each
Abbreviated Resettlement Plan will be furnished to the World Bank for consideration no later
than three months prior to the actual initiation of the works under the Project. Compensation,
resettlement and rehabilitation activities will only commence after the World Bank has found
acceptable the respective Abbreviated Resettlement Plan and the EVN has approved it. The
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation activities will be completed before awarding the
contracts of civil works under each sub-project.


Resettlement Plan
12.    In case more than 200 people are affected by the project, a full Resettlement Plan (RP)
will be prepared by the respective PC in accordance with the provisions of this Policy
Framework. The RP will be furnished by PC under EVN to the World Bank for its
concurrence.


13.      Each RP will include: (1) description of the project; (2) project potential impacts; (3)
objectives; (4) socio-economic studies; (5) legal framework; (6) institutional framework; (7)
eligibility; (8) valuation and compensation for losses; (9) resettlement measures; (10) site
selection, site preparation and relocation; (11) housing, infrastructure, and social services; (12)
environmental protection and management; (13) participation and consultation; (14) integration
with host populations; (15) grievances procedures; (16) organizational responsibilities; (17)
implementation schedule; (18) cost and budget; and, (19) monitoring and evaluation.


14.     Each RP will be completed by no later than six months prior to the estimated date for
commencement of the works. Each RP will be furnished to the World Bank for consideration by
no later than three months prior to the actual initiation of the works under the Project.
Rehabilitation and assistance activities will only commence after the World Bank has found
acceptable the respective RP and EVN has approved it. Rehabilitation and assistance activities
will be completed before awarding contracts of civil works under each sub-project.


             SECTION 2: INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK
A.     Institutional Framework
15.     The responsibility for preparing and implementing the Policy Framework and RPs are
as follows:
       The overall responsibility for enforcement of the Policy Framework and for planning and
implementing RPs rests with PCs under EVN. The PCs and their Project Provincial Powers
(PPPs) are responsible for carrying out census, socioeconomic survey and inventories and
preparing RPs and for the day-to-day implementation thereof within their respective
jurisdiction. The people’s committees at the district and commune levels will participate in the
RP preparation and implementation. These administrative units will also ensure the active and
effective participation of the DPs in the RP preparation and implementation. In order to have
RPs acceptable to the World Bank and to implement RP smoothly, PCs under EVN are
responsible for i) hiring qualified consultants to prepare RPs; ii) appointing qualified social
safeguard staff at each PC and its Project Management Board (PMB) and Compensation and
Resettlement Committees at provincial and district levels.
(a)       Funds for compensation will be from EVN and budgetary requirements for economic
          restoration, other assistance would be either from counter part funds or from IDA.
B.         Legal Framework
16.     This section reviews the legal framework and policies of the Government of Vietnam
and IDA policies related to land acquisition, compensation and resettlement. It then
compares the two approaches. Since there are differences between the WB’s policy and the
Vietnamese’s, the project requires a waiver of the Vietnamese Government articles of decrees
and regulations concerning compensation and resettlement. Subsequently, compensation and
resettlement plans will be implemented according to the project policies.
17.    The Legal Framework of the Government of Vietnam: The key national laws, decrees
governing land acquisition, compensation and resettlement in Vietnam consist of the
following:
          The Constitution of Vietnam, 1992 confirms the right of citizens to own a house and
           to protect the ownership of the house.
          The Land Law 2003 issued on December 10th, 2003.
          Decree 181/2004/ND-CP issued on October 29, 2004 guiding the implementation of
           the Land Law revised 2003.
          Decree 197/2004/ND-CP issued on December 3, 2004 on compensation, support and
           resettlement when land is recovered by the state.
          Circular 116/2004/TT-BTC issued on December 7, 2004 guiding the implementation
           of compensation, support and resettlement when land is recovered by the State.
          Decree 188/2004/ND-CP issued on November 16, 2004 on methods to determine land
           prices and assorted land price brackets.
          Circular 114/2004/TT-BTC issued by November 26, 2004 guiding the implementation
           of the Government’s decree No 188/2004/ND-CP
          Decree 17/2006/ND-CP dated January 27, 2006 on revision and supplementation of
           some regulations in decrees guiding the implementation of the Land Law.
          Decree 84/2007/ND-CP dated May 25th 2007 on revision of issuing LURC, land
           acquisition, implementation of land use right, procedure for compensation,
           resettlement when land acquired by State and grievance redress.


         Decree No. 69/2009/ND-CP, effective 1st October 2009; an amendment to Decree
          No. 197/2004/ND-CP; supplementary regulations on land use planning, land prices,
          land acquisition, compensation, support and resettlement.
         Circular 14/2009/TT-BTNMT dated October 1, 2009 providing detailed regulations
          on compensation, assistance, relocation, and process and procedures for land
          acquisition, land han-over and lean lease.
18.        World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
18.1       The primary objective of the World Bank policy is to explore all alternatives to
avoid or at least minimize involuntary resettlement. Where resettlement is unavoidable, the
living standards of displaced persons should be restored or improved relative to those
conditions that prevailed prior to the Project. The policy applies to the taking of land and
other assets when land acquisition results in the loss of shelter, the loss of all or part of
productive assets, or access to them, and the loss of income sources or other means of
livelihood.
18.2         Measures required ensuring that resettlement has a positive outcome include:
           Consulting with potential Project-affected people on feasible measures for
            resettlement and rehabilitation;
           Providing Project-affected persons with options for resettlement and rehabilitation;
           Enabling their participation in planning and selecting these options;
           Providing compensation at full replacement cost for losses;
           Choosing relocation sites that provide, at a minimum, the same benefits and services
            as the sites they replace;
           Providing allowances, training and income support to assist in making a smooth
            transition;
           Identifying vulnerable groups and providing special assistance to these groups; and,
           Establishing an institutional and organizational structure that supports this process to
            a successful end.
18.3         Eligibility Criteria and Compensation:
18.3.1 The displaced or project-affected people eligible for compensation will include: (a)
those who have formal legal rights to land or other assets; (b) those who initially do not have
formal legal rights to land or other assets but have a claim to legal rights based upon the laws
of the country; upon the possession of documents such as land tax receipts and residence
certificates; or upon the permission of local authorities to occupy or use the project affected
plots; and (c) those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are
occupying.
18.3.2     Persons covered under (a) and (b) are provided compensation for the land they lose,
and other assistance. Persons covered under (c) are provided resettlement assistance, 4 in
lieu of compensation for the land they occupy, and other assistance, as necessary, to achieve
the objectives set out in this policy, if they occupy the project area prior to a cut-off dates
defined in RPs. Persons who encroach on the areas after the cut-off date 5 defined in RPs are
not entitled to compensation or any other form of resettlement assistance.
19. Project Principles of Resettlement. The principle for resettlement policy in the project
will be described as follows:
(i)         Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized as
            much as possible.
(ii)        All DPs residing, working, doing business or cultivating land within the recovered
            area under the Project as of the cut-off-date are entitled to be provided with
            rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain their
            pre-Project living standards, income earning capacity and production levels. Lack of
            legal rights to the assets lost will not bar the DP from entitlement to such rehabilitation
            measures.
(iii)       The rehabilitation measures to be provided are: (i) compensation at replacement cost,
            without deduction for depreciation or salvage materials for houses and other
            structures; (ii) priority given for agricultural land-for-land of equal productive capacity
         acceptable to the DPs; (iii) replacement of premise land (if any) of equal size and
         acceptable to the DPs; (iv) transportation and subsistence allowances, and (v)
         business/ income rehabilitation allowances.
(iv)     The project will cover the scope of the vulnerable groups as defined under the World
         Bank OP 4.12. The project will provide additional assistance to those households that
         fall within the definition of vulnerable groups. The project will use the criteria applied
         by the MOLISA benchmark to assess the poverty line for residents of the project area
         to further define the additional allowances (e. g. monthly income per capita), which
         will be provided by the project to vulnerable households in both urban and rural areas.
         For the project’s RPs, vulnerable groups under the poverty line set for by Molisa will
         include the landless, the elderly, and women headed households, disable persons and
         those households eligible to the Social Policy - defined as those with heroes –mother,
         and/or with member who lay down one’ life for country and/ or wounded in the war.
          All poor vulnerable groups under the poverty line, including those covered by the
         social policy, will get additional assistance as follows: (i) for landless households, the
         project will provide assistance through the provision of land-for-land with secure
         tenure at no cost to landless households. The project's RPs will define the size of land
         for urban and rural areas, or cash equivalent if DPs upon consultation prefer self-
         relocation; (ii) poor households who fall below the poverty line and whose 10% or
         more of their productive land/assets, will be entitled to income restoration assistance.
         Other vulnerable groups, such as female headed households, households with disabled
         persons, and elderly without any source of support, will get the same assistance given
         to poor households. Income restoration will be tailored to households’ specific needs
         and based on consultations with affected people.
(v)      Replacement of premise and agricultural land or residential land will be as near as
         possible to the land that was lost, and acceptable to the DP. In the event that there is
         no land available for compensation ‘land for land’, or if it is the choice of DPs, then
         compensation in cash or provision of apartment (for DPs losing residential land and
         relocating) may be applied. If the DPs lose 10% or more of their holding, then in
         addition to compensation for lost land, the Project will provide rehabilitation
         /assistance measures.
(vi)     The resettlement transition period will be minimized and the DPs shall be supported
         for transportation allowance, house renting allowances as specified by the PPC and for
         the means of rehabilitation no later than one month prior to the expected start-up date
         of civil work on the respective sub-project site.
(vii)    Plans for acquisition of land and other assets, and provision of rehabilitation measures,
         will be carried out in consultation with the DPs to ensure minimal disturbance.
         Entitlements will be provided to DPs no later than one month prior to expected start-
         up of civil works at the respective sub-project site.
(viii)   The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained or
         improved.
(ix)     Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and be made available to cover
         the costs of land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation within the agreed
         implementation period. Physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be
         made available as and when required.
(x)      Civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession or a notice to proceed
         for any sub-project unless the Government has (a) Completed, satisfactorily and in
         accordance with the approved RP for that sub-project, compensation payments, and
        (b) ensured rehabilitation assistance is in place prior to starting civil work.
        Entitlements will be provided to DPs no later than one month prior to expected start-
        up of civil works at the respective project site.
(xi)    Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning,
        consultation and implementation of the RPs; and
(xii)   Appropriate reporting, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be identified and
        set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Evaluation of the land
        acquisition process and the final outcome will be conducted independent of the
        executing agency.
20.          Valuation of and Compensation for Losses:
The methodology to be used in the valuation of losses for Bank-associated Projects is based
on their replacement cost. In this Project, losses comprise land, structures and other assets.
Replacement cost for land includes the value of land at market price plus the cost taxes and
fees to get Land Use Right Certificate (LURC). For houses and other structures, the market
cost of the materials should be used to calculate the replacement cost to build a replacement
structure with an area and the quality should be at least as good as those affected. For both
totally and partially affected structures, compensation includes market cost of material, plus
the costs of material transport, labor and contractor fees, registration and transfer taxes.
Depreciation of the asset and amount saved in materials will not form a part of replacement
cost. During the implementation phase, an independent land appraiser (s) will be mobilized to
survey and propose a set of replacement costs for all types of affected land (both agriculture
and residential land) and assets, which will be approved by sub-project provincial PC (s) and
acceptable to WB. And the replacement cost survey, done by the independent land appraiser,
will ensure the land/assets be compensated at the replacement cost (according to the OP 4.12
definition).
21.     Comparison between Government of Vietnam and World Bank Approaches
Recent Laws, Decrees and Regulations bring the Government of Viet Nam resettlement
policies and practices to be more consistent with the World Bank’s resettlement policies. In
the event of discrepancies between the Borrower’s laws, regulations, and procedures and the
World Bank's policies and requirements, the latter will prevail. This is in accordance with
Decree No. 131/2006/ND-CP, which states that in case of “discrepancy between any
provision in an international treaty on Official Development Assistance, to which the
Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a signatory, and the Vietnamese Law, the provision in the
international treaty on ODA shall take precedence? (Article 2, Item 5). The differences
between the Government’s Laws and Decrees and World Bank Policy with regard to
resettlement and compensation, and how to address these gaps are shown in Table 1.

42.    In addition to verifying the information furnished in the internal supervision and
monitoring reports of the respective PCs, the external monitoring agency will visit a sample of
20% of household DPs in each relevant province six months after each implementation to:
      (a)       Determine whether the procedures for DPs participation and delivery of
                compensation and other rehabilitation entitlements has been done in accordance
                with this Policy Framework; and
      (b)       Assess if the Policy Framework objective of enhancement or at least restoration
                of living standards and income levels of DPs have been met.
      (c)       Gather qualitative indications of the social and economic impact of Project
                implementation on the DPs.
      (d)       Suggest modification in the implementation procedures of s, as the case may be,
                to achieve the principles and objectives of this Policy Framework.
43.    A Resettlement Plan cannot be considered complete until a completion audit or survey
confirms that all entitlements have been received by beneficiaries and livelihood restoration is
progressing on schedule.
                              SECTION 8: COSTS AND BUDGET


44.     Each RP will include detailed cost of rehabilitation and other restoration/assistance
entitlements and relocation of DPs, if that be the case, with a breakdown by agricultural land,
residential land, business land, houses, businesses and other assets. The cost estimates will
make adequate provision for contingencies.
45.    Sources of funding for the various activities will be clearly specified in the cost tables.
For Distribution Efficiency sub-projects, funds for implementing RPs will be from
counterparts: EVN and/or PCs will arrange budget for implementing RPs.
Annexes
1. Annex 1 : Entitlement Matrix
2. Annex 2 : Proposed Inventory form of Project Affected People


Note: 1 The term "displaced persons" refers to persons who are affected in any of the ways
described in para. 7(c) and 19.3.1 of this RPF.
        2 “Replacement cost? is the method of valuation of assets that helps determine the
amount sufficient to replace lost assets and cover transaction costs. In applying this method
of valuation, depreciation of structures and assets should not be taken into. For losses that
cannot easily be valued or compensated for in monetary terms (e.g., access to public services,
customers, and suppliers; or to fishing, grazing, or forest areas), attempts are made to
establish access to equivalent and culturally acceptable resources and earning opportunities.
Where domestic law does not meet the standard of compensation at full replacement cost,
compensation under domestic law is supplemented by additional measures necessary to meet
the replacement cost standard.
      3 “Entire displaced population are minor?: Impacts are considered "minor" if the
affected people are not physically displaced and less than 10% of their productive assets are
lost.
4 Resettlement assistance: Resettlement assistance may consist of land, other assets, cash,
employment, and so on, as appropriate.
5 the cut-off date: Normally, the cut-off date is the date the census begins. The cut-off date
could also be the date the project area was delineated, prior to the census, provided that
there has been an effective public dissemination of information on the area delineated, and
systematic and continuous dissemination subsequent to the delineation to prevent further
population influx.
