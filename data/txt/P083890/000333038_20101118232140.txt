1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of project preparation, Bangladesh's economy had been growing at around
5% per year marked by higher private sector investment along with high levels of donor
assistance. The Government, and particularly its Finance Minister, was seen as keen to
engage in reforms to sustain this growth. Government recognized the need to overcome
its own institutional capacity constraints, particularly in the civil service. The Economic
Management Technical Assistance Project (EMTAP) PAD concluded that the
Government's "reform agenda requires stronger institutions for public management and
a stronger accountability framework for the country to achieve better economic, social
and service delivery outcomes." Specifically, the PAD noted that:

      Institutions for policy formulation, implementation and monitoring needed to be
       strengthened.
      Stronger management of revenues was essential to ensure fiscal balance and
       provide adequate resources to finance much needed public services.
      Standards of accounting and auditing in the corporate sector needed improvement.
      Civil service practices and the functioning of the public administration required
       attention.

Concurrent with EMTAP's preparation, the Bank had begun a series of development
support credits (DSC I was approved in June 2003 and DSC II would be approved a few
months after EMTAP). The aim of these operations was to support macroeconomic
stability and accelerate pro-poor growth, improve governance, invest in human
development and strengthen social protection through reforms in several sectors. These
focus areas were aligned with the policies of Bangladesh's Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) adopted 2003 as well as the priorities in the Bank's own Country
Assistance Strategy which was then being drafted (for discussion of the limited linkage to
DSCs see Section 5.1)

EMTAP fit into this context as an umbrella program of technical assistance to support
institutional capacity building in the broad areas of policy formulation, implementation
and monitoring, civil service and better functioning of public administration. Two-thirds
of the allocation for TA components was identified in advance, and one third was to be
identified during implementation and funded through an unallocated pool of resources.
This breadth and flexibility was seen as an innovative way to overcome rigidities which
had hampered prior Bank TA projects in Bangladesh

The original total project cost for EMTAP was $25 million, out of which an IDA grant
covered $20 million. The Government's $5 million contribution was then dropped in
2007. Processing the project in 2004 was important because Bangladesh's eligibility for
IDA grant funds was to end that fiscal year and the Government was reluctant to borrow
for technical assistance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PAD, the Grant Agreement and the ISRs give slightly different formulations of the
PDOs and key indicators. The version in the PAD is used for the purposes of the ICR. It
is:

The main objective will be to strengthen institutional capacities in core areas of
economic and public management and contribute to better policy management and
improved functioning of the public administration and the corporate sector. More
specifically, the project is expected to contribute to (i) strengthening government's ability
to mobilize revenues effectively and efficiently; (ii) strengthening corporate governance;
iii) improving functioning of the government through enhanced use of information and
communication technologies; (iv) promoting better public understanding of and support
for the government's reform agenda by strengthening the communication strategy; (v)
strengthening government's capacities to formulate and monitor policy and institutional
reforms through better functioning of the public management institutions.

The first sentence can be interpreted as the PDO, and the rest as subsidiary DOs. DO
subsection (v) relates to Component 1, and the rest for Components 2-5 in sequence.

The Key Indicators are noted in the Datasheet. These are derived from the PAD itself.


 1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

There was no formal change in the PDO or key indicators. However, EMTAP contained a large
unallocated Component 1 which would be provided for additional activities within broadly
defined criteria. With the emergence of these activities, de facto additional objectives were
identified, though these did not undergo separate Board approval. The wording of Key Indicators
also changed over time in the ISRs, though changes were not formally approved.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

During preparation the Bank expected that EMTAP would focus on cross cutting
systemic issues of economic policy making and public administration, and hence liaised
with the Ministries of Finance and Establishment, the National Planning Commission and
the Prime Minister's Office. The actual beneficiaries were those designated to
implement components: National Board of Revenue; Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Commerce, Ministry of Science and ICT; and Ministry of Information (the Ministry of
Finance's Economic Relations Department received modest assistance as the overall
coordinator as well). Component 1 subsequently was allocated among additional entities:
Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (Planning Ministry); Chittagong
Port Authority; Parliamentary Accounts Committee; the Public Service Commission; and
the Bangladesh Board of Statistics. In addition, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Bangladesh (ICAB) and Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh
(ICMAB), both private sector professional bodies, were beneficiaries of twinning


                                               2
arrangements financed by the project. In a broader sense, project components expected
to build capacity within Government to coordinate policies and pursue I-PRSP goals,
thereby providing benefit to the general public.

1.5 Original Components


As designed, EMTAP comprised six components:

   1. Strengthening government capacities for better policy formulation and
      implementation, and improving the functioning of the civil service and public
      administration. ($8.23 million - initially an unallocated component).
   2. Modernizing revenue administration ($4.02 million)
   3. Strengthening accounting and auditing practices in the corporate sector ($6.13
      million).
   4. Improving information and communications technology (ICT) use in the
      Government ($4.06 million).
   5. Strengthening communications between Government and external stakeholders
      ($0.4 million)
   6. Logistical and consultancy services to support the central management of the
      EMTAP by the World Branch-1 of ERD ($0.16 million).


1.6 Revised Components

No revisions occurred. In line with the project design of a flexible unallocated pool of
funds under Component 1, five additional activities were subsequently funded:
   1. Feasibility study for an Internal Container Port for the Chittagong Port Authority
   2. Study of e-Procurement for IMED
   3. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics
   4. Bangladesh Public Service Commission
   5. Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament.

1.7 Other significant changes

There were two major additional changes. In January 2007, a decision was taken to
permit the Government to claim up to 100% of expenditures up to the Bank's $20 million
threshold, dropping counterpart funding. Second, implementing agencies were allowed
to have separate accounts for taka payments, which would be replenished through the
Dollar Special Account (DOSA) managed by ERD. ERD also appointed a full-time
Project Director at the same time. No Mid-Term Review was conducted which might
have led to a restructuring (see Section 5.1 for full account).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


                                            3
Project preparation appears to have been conducted on a fast, but generally adequate,
timeframe and in consultation with the counterpart. The total elapsed time from the first
informal discussions between the Bank and the client to completion of the PAD was a
little less than one year.

The design of the project was burdened by a set of ambitious development outcomes
which were spread over a broad set of areas. The range of planned activities involved
several Government agencies which was likely to complicate implementation. While the
flexibility of the unallocated Component 1 was viewed as a positive feature of the design,
it led to further complexity as additional subcomponents, with their own specific
objectives, implementation arrangements, and M&E plans, would emerge. Moreover the
criteria for selecting these additional subcomponents were excessively broad. EMTAP
was effectively designed as a conglomeration of small technical assistance projects which
would involve separate GoB institutions, multiple task team leaders, and significant
transaction costs. This would lead to a high overall management burden to both GoB and
the Bank. At the same time, the linkages among components were looser and less
strategic than what was implied by the overall DO.

EMTAP was designed to use country systems, and the preparation team acknowledged
that this could make implementation less predictable. An initially attractive feature of the
design, country systems in the Bangladesh case required the preparation and approval of
Technical Project Proposals (TPP) for each component and, in the case of Component 1,
each sub-component. The team was aware this could delay implementation, but was
unable to secure a simplification of the process, either through a single TPP for the entire
project or by using a shortened form of TPP for each component.

The Government's commitment was less strong than the Bank had anticipated. There
was overall support from the Ministry of Finance during preparation and initial but not
always sustained interest in each of the components by the implementing agencies.
While TPPs were reported to be in an advanced stage at negotiations, this later proved not
to be the case. Implementation could not start without an approved TPP.

The Project Concept Note Review from February 2004 had flagged critical risk areas
such as: ensuring government ownership of the components; uncertainty about the ability
to build institutional capacity in a volatile environment and the need to link more
explicitly with DSC II. The Review stressed the need for adequate eligibility criteria for
the Component 1 sub-projects and the need for smooth implementation arrangements
while using country systems. The Review further stressed the importance of developing
a strong monitoring and evaluation plan. The PAD does not contain a risk matrix, but
picks up the critical risks identified by the concept note review and sets them out in a
narrative fashion, together with mitigation strategies (on p. 15).

A QEA was conducted by QAG in 2005, which gave a moderately unsatisfactory rating.
It is discussed under section 5.1 (Bank Performance). It came too late to benefit design,
but signaled that close attention by management would be needed.



                                             4
2.2 Implementation

EMTAP's implementation was very slow for the first two years with slightly less than
5% of funds disbursed, and then picked up, but never sufficiently to utilize more than a
fraction of the funds available within the grant. Implementation proceeded at different
rates for each component, but overall the utilization of funds remained slow (under 30%
with one year left on the project). This prompted the Government to request an extension
of the closing date which was ultimately denied. The circumstances surrounding this
decision not to extend are discussed in Section 5.

The delay in the first two years was due to the need for participating agencies to prepare
their TPPs (see Annex 8 for a discussion on the TTP process). With the exception of the
TPP for ERD (which only involved serving as EMTAP's coordinator), no TPP was
approved until the beginning of 2006. The second period, from 2006 to late 2008, is
when activity on most components began, but because of procurement lags, total
disbursements remained low. The third period is from 2008 to closing at the end of 2009,
when disbursements started to show increased project activity, particularly in the NBR
component and several of the additional subcomponents under Component 1. By then,
closure was imminent, and in several cases procurement processes had to be shut down
because of the lack of time to execute contracts before the project closed.


Project reports chart the slow progress of the project, with commensurate reduction in
overall and component ratings. By the middle of 2006, overall ratings were Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) for DOs and selected IPs, and three component ratings (ICT, Strategic
Communications, and Central Project Coordination) had been lowered to Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU), with the remainder rated MS. While the Bank implementation
review mission in the middle of 2006 maintained its overall development objectives
rating of MU, it stated that: "this overall rating masks uneven performance and
substantial implementation shortfalls and weaknesses in project management in some
areas. Twenty months after effectiveness, project aid disbursement is limited to just 5%
of total IDA commitment for EMTAP ($20 million)." Later in the Aide Memoire, the
mission and Bank management seek "Government intervention to help revive the
implementation of this TA project which is supporting capacity building in priority areas
of public sector management". Despite this, the ISR for the period (mid 2006) gave an
MS rating for both the DO and the implementing agency.

Implementation began slowly to pick up as internal approval processes were completed
and procurement actions initiated by the end of 2006 for initially allocated components
except for the Ministry of Information. However, because of the lag in contracting of
consultants and ordering of equipment, cumulative disbursements remained low up until
2008. Overall, the performance was disappointing relative to what had been expected at
project approval.




                                            5
Implementation of EMTAP by Component

Component 1: ($8.3 million), Unallocated. The first sub-project in this category to be
implemented was a feasibility study for an internal container facility, undertaken by
consultants for the Chittagong Port Authority. This was an unexpected component, but
nonetheless fit within the rather broad component criteria, and appears to have been
executed satisfactorily. It was followed by a small study on e-procurement. The next
sub-project was $1.6 million for capacity building of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics,
for which the nearly all activities were completed satisfactorily. A subproject for
strengthening the Bangladesh Public Service Commission started in 2008 and another
subproject to support the PAC effectively started only in January 2009 after Parliament
reconvened. Due to the late starts, little was achieved by EMTAP's closure.

Implementation of this Component only weakly achieved the design intent of a flexible,
responsive mechanism for activities in pursuit of the general DO. Financing for the
small container depot and e-procurement studies occurred quickly, but in general
Component 1 sub-project proposals were slow in coming forth and Bank and ERD staff
had to actively canvas agencies to submit proposals.

Component 2: ($4.02 million) focused on the National Board of Revenue, and was
intended to be a first step towards greater involvement and reforms in this critical area,
through a possible revenue administration modernization project. The money was spent
partly on office refurbishment (completed but in a way that led to a finding of
irregularities by the Bank), procuring a substantial amount of IT equipment, and on
external and local consultant studies. The NBR was reluctant to share with the Bank the
results of these studies, at least in the final two years of the project. No major reforms
have yet occurred in NBR, though it is not possible to ascertain whether this was due to
lack of receptivity, a time lag to carry out significant reforms, or whether the consultants'
reports themselves were appropriate and of sufficient quality. In any case, the planned
project to build on EMTAP, the Revenue Administration Modernization Project (RAMP)
was ultimately not taken up. From the Bank's perspective, EMTAP was an opportunity
to encourage NBR to consider the type of structural reforms that involved greater
autonomy and a more function based organization, which have been effective in raising
the revenue to GDP ratio in some other countries. This does not seem to have happened
within the framework of the project. At the same time, some of the technical assistance
reportedly has subsequently been useful in informing discussion within NBR to modify
its customs and VAT administration regimes.

Component 3: ($6.13 million) was implemented by Finance Division of the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and entailed strengthening accounting and
auditing in the corporate sector. Implementation began in January 2006, and all but
approximately $1.0 million of the original allocation of $3.62 million for the Finance
Division's portion of the project was spent. With the help of an external consultant, a
draft Financial Reporting Bill was prepared and approved by the Cabinet. The then BNP-
led Government's tenure ended, but the ensuing Caretaker Government eventually
promulgated the legislation as an Ordinance. This Ordinance lapsed after the return to



                                              6
elected government, though the current government has since returned to the issue and
directed the Ministry of Finance to revise the bill to fit better Bangladeshi legal practice
(essentially rearranging sections that should be in implementing regulations). The
Financial Reporting Council was not created in the absence of an Act, and thus the funds
allocated under this component for capacity building (about $1.0 million) were not used.

The more successful part of this component was the twinning of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
England and Wales (ICAEW), and the Institute of Cost Management Accountants of
Bangladesh (ICMAB) with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants of the
UK. This resulted in the modernization of ICAB training curricula and certification
standards. Had EMTAP been extended, FRC savings would have allowed the formal
twinning period to be lengthened.

Component 4: ($4.06 million) was to promote use of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in the Government of Bangladesh, and was delegated to the
Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) for execution. A number of external consultancy
studies were commissioned, which were supposed to feed into a National ICT Strategy.
Two of the three major reports were delivered and of high quality. However although
stakeholder workshops were held, the BCC felt that the analysis and recommendations
didn't provide sufficient information, particularly in setting a baseline for ICT
requirements, and direction. The studies were not utilized in a direct sense by the team
preparing the 2009 National ICT Strategy, though reportedly there were extensive
consultations between the authors and the consultants. The conclusion of the ICR is that
the studies were useful and could have improved the National Strategy if they had been
used. The Component also had a strong training component for 2500 provincial civil
servants that the BCC staff emphasized was of high quality and timely.

Component 5 ($0.4 million) was strengthening development communication between
government and stakeholders, and envisaged the creation of a Strategic Communications
Unit (SCU) in the Press Information Department of the Ministry of Information.
Although the concept of a SCU seems to have been accepted, the unit was not created.
The component procured 50 computers and led to the production of three films, and
conducted radio and television talk shows. Fifteen seminars were conducted for
information officers in various parts of the country.

Component 6 ($0.16 million) comprised logistical and consultancy support to the unit of
ERD responsible for managing the overall implementation of the project. The inputs
helped build the World Bank Branch 1 division of ERD's capacity, as intended, though a
full time Project Director was appointed only in 2007.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The intent of the project was that each component (and Component 1 sub-project) would
have its own M&E framework. The PAD's main text and Annex 3 contains sets of
indicators some of which, taken individually, were reasonable, albeit suffering from the
frequent difficulty of developing SMART public sector capacity building indicators


                                             7
which have plausible causality from project outputs. The indicators thus focused on
milestones (e.g. `strategy implemented' or `Act adopted') rather than progress and
impacts which are hard to measure and identify attribution.

There were two ex ante problems with the monitoring framework. First, there were
inconsistencies in the wording and scope of indicators between the PAD's main text,
Annex 3, and the Key Results Indicators listed in the formal Grant Agreement. These
differences were minor, but nonetheless confusing. More important, the number of
indicators was excessive. For Components 2-6, The PAD documents contain either 31
(main text) or 21 (Annex 3) indicators while the Grant Agreement contains 29 key results
indicators. It further provides for agencies to work out an M&E framework for all sub-
project proposals seeking finance under Component 1. This would be a difficult task
given the capacity of GoB agencies used to measuring inputs and outputs to develop
meaningful indicators.

In practice, use of this monitoring framework was beyond the capacity of implementing
agencies to utilize (and in the case of Component 1 subprojects, were mostly not
established, relying simply on reporting on outputs). Baselines were never adequately
established. Implementation Supervision reports (ISRs) provide some key indicators for
each component though they inconsistently select up to 14 indicators (often confusingly
titling an indicator as a DO). ISRs and AMs all focus on activities rather than using a
monitoring framework. As a result, there was inadequate reporting of project activities,
outputs and results.

The lack of reporting on indicators also reflected lack of familiarity with the Bank's more
intense approach to M&E than the GoB (TPPs do not require an elaborate monitoring
framework), and lack of institutional capacity. A simpler M&E framework for all the
project components would have been more in keeping with country systems and capacity
as well as time constraints of Bank TTLs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There are no social safeguard issues arising from the implementation of EMTAP. There
was an issue regarding irregularities with procurement on Component 2 which was
identified by the Bank. The office refurbishment contract award for NBR was deemed by
the Bank to have irregularities about which the Bank is now following up with the
Government.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The post completion operation of EMTAP component activities was heavily affected by
the manner in which the project was closed. Component PDs had expected an extension
in order to complete activities and were caught unprepared by the decision to close the
project on its original end date, 31 December 2009. For a fuller discussion of what
occurred, see section 5.2 (Bank Performance).




                                             8
Few transition arrangements were made. There is no M&E system in place that would
monitor future impact. In any case, given that EMTAP chiefly provided external and
local consultancy expertise and capacity building, transition arrangements were
effectively about whether the improvements developed and recommended by consultants
have been taken up, and whether training improved the operations of the implementing
agencies. This is hard to measure under any circumstances. Based on limited available
information, it appears that there have been few such impacts with the exception of work
on financial accounting and perhaps some subsequent utility for revenue mobilization.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project's overall development objective was broad and ambitious, and relevant to
both the government's goals as expressed in the I-PRSP, and the Bank's goals as set forth
in the CAS, to improve public policy coordination, public administration, and service
delivery. The PAD notes the need to address cross-cutting issues of public management,
including civil service reform, if progress towards these goals is to be made.

The likelihood of the project's design contributing meaningfully to these ambitious goals
was low. While components 2-5 relate in piecemeal fashion to the overall DO,
addressing critical cross-cutting issues was left to Component 1. The criteria for
allocation and the lack of engagement of key central management agencies (e.g. PM's
Office or Cabinet Division) for the Component raise doubts that this would be achieved.

The design of an "umbrella" project like EMTAP had four potential advantages. First,
there is the administrative ease of approving small projects in a single process. Second, it
provided an opportunity for risk-taking through smaller engagements in numerous areas,
as was the case with revenue mobilization. Third, it allowed for filling in small gaps in
the overall framework of assistance being provided by the Bank and other development
partners to GoB. Finally, the project could have achieved synergies among the
components, particularly in the context of development policy lending. These advantages
were mostly not obtained by EMTAP. While approval was swift, this was offset by
complexity of implementation which should have been anticipated. Synergies were
lacking among components and with the DSCs. There was some benefit to beginning
engagement, if only to allow for a sober assessment to not proceed, as was the case with a
planned revenue mobilization project.

Achievement of the other benefits would have required a much higher degree of
engagement and capacity within the Government. While the Bank responded to the
initial vision expressed by Ministry of Finance in 2003-4 and made use of availability of
grant funds, ultimately there was a disconnect between the hope of what could be
achieved by external consultancy expertise and agencies' willingness to absorb and apply
these technical assistance inputs for reforms. There was no overall champion to lead in
utilizing the TA of even coordinate on substantive matters.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives


                                             9
The overall PDO of strengthened institutional capacity was not achieved except in a few
cases. Even if issues of late starts and limited IA engagement had not been present, the
project's components would not plausibly have achieved the PDO's ambitions. The
individual component DOs were more concrete, but were mostly not achieved.

Component 1 had a DO to "strengthen government's capacities to formulate,
implement and monitor policy and institutional reforms through a better functioning of
public management institutions" which was largely not achieved given the nature of the
sub-projects (only three had significant public management content) and the late start.
While there was utility to the work completed on the container facility, e-procurement,
and statistics, its relation to the ambitious DO was minimal.

Component 2 had a DO "strengthen Government's ability to mobilize revenues
effectively and efficiently through a better functioning of the tax administration." While
most activities were carried out, these did not lead to substantial changes in NBR's
operations.

Component 3 aimed to "strengthen corporate governance through improved auditing and
accounting practices in the corporate sector and increased transparency in financial
reporting". These were at least partially achieved. While the Financial Reporting Act
still awaits passage, it can be expected to occur thanks to inputs from EMTAP. Improved
training for professional audit and accounting associations has been established

Component 4 aimed to "improve information and communication technologies in the
Government by making use of electronic communication". This was only partially
achieved through successful training; substantive inputs of consultants had minimal
impact on ICT policy while expected equipment purchases did not occur.

Component 5 aimed to "create conditions and the necessary institutional architecture for
improving the communications strategy of the Government to promote understanding of
and support for economic reforms". No impacts were obtained under this Component.

3.3 Efficiency

As a TA project, EMTAP was under no requirement to undertake a NPV/ERR analysis.
The amount of Government and Bank staff time expended (nearly $1 million spent on the
latter) to disburse $9.48 million, much of which were sunk costs to get components
started. Had the project closing date been extended on a selective basis, disbursements
would have increased significantly in 2010 and sub-project outputs would have been
more substantial. The extent to which overall results would have changed is difficult to
judge, though this ICR assesses that the BPSC, BBS, and PAC subcomponents, as well as
the financial accounting component, might have achieved more under an extension.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory


                                              10
There were shortcomings in project design, monitoring and evaluation, and slow
implementation. No major steps were undertaken to address these issues over the life of
the project; no mid-term review was conducted. When project implementation began to
accelerate as the scheduled closing date drew near, there was miscommunication
regarding an extension. This undercut the activities that began to be carried out in the
BPSC and PAC sub-components. Discussion of achievements in each of the components
in relation to outcomes is in Section 3.2.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There are no direct poverty, gender or social development impacts. There is an indirect
positive poverty impact through strengthening the BBS' ability to undertake poverty
survey work.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

EMTAP's DO was institutional strengthening and did not achieve anticipated reuslts.
See Sections 2.2 and 3.2 for assessment.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

Since the development outcomes were in large part not achieved, there is little to be
sustained, and hence risk is low. As of the writing of this ICR, there have not been
follow-up activities by the Bank with the exception of work with the PAC. The two most
sustainable elements of EMTAP are likely to be the statistical survey frameworks
developed for BBS and are already being used, and the twinning arrangements between
ICAB and, to a lesser extent, ICMAB, and reputable overseas bodies.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)      Bank       Performance          in        Ensuring    Quality       at      Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Task Team prepared the project over a period of nine months, in response to the
client's demands, while getting the project to the Board in sufficient time to secure grant
financing. The resulting design had strategic intent, as reflected in its PDO and DOs, and
accompanying narrative about building capacity on core government management


                                              11
agencies and supporting public administration reform. This was consistent with the CAS
and the I-PRSP, and the project was built upon a good understanding of capacity
weakness.

However, the Bank's performance in ensuring quality on entry was weak in a number of
respects:

   (i) Overly ambitious development objectives;

   (ii) Complex design as an umbrella project with weak underlying conceptual
          cohesion;

   (iii)Insufficient recognition of implementation challenges stemming from design;

   (iv) Overly complex and confusing M&E system; and

   (v) Lack of confirmed ownership within the Government for the components.

Overly ambitious PDO and component DOs. There was a disconnect between goals of
major institutional capacity strengthening for at least six entities for a project involving
low levels of technical assistance. Had there been a deeper connection to development
policy lending or linked to specific sector operations, the PDOs were more likely to be
accomplished.

Complex umbrella design without underlying conceptual cohesion. EMTAP's design
consisted of components which had disparate objectives, counterparts, and task team
leaders from the Bank side under the general rubric of strengthening institutional
capacity. The components designated at entry did not have synergies; collectively the
components never were going to be more than the sum of their parts.

Coherence might have been obtained by either more tightly linked components or else
linkage with a broader development agenda. The design appeared to target the latter:
EMTAP was initially intended to provide technical support for policy changes anticipated
in the 2nd Development Support Credit (approved in mid-2004), in particular civil service
reform as a cross-cutting theme. However, the resulting project components were not
related to policy reforms stated in DSC II (though revenue mobilization and auditing and
accounting were reforms called for in the successive DSC III approved at the end of
2005).

Insufficient recognition of implementation challenges stemming from design. The
umbrella design created a hierarchy for implementation where ERD had financial
management responsibility for components which slowed project implementation until
operational accounts for the components were set up in 2007. It was debatable whether
ERD was the most appropriate body to coordinate the project given its lack of project
implementation experience and expertise in any of the substantive areas (though it was
able to develop it over time). Lastly, the design mandated that there be an approved TPP



                                            12
for the ERD component in order to be effective, but it did not recognize that the same
process required for each component would significantly delay implementation.

The complexity of the project also involved a significant implementation support burden
on the Bank because it required separate TTLs for each of the components (and later
subcomponents) as well as overall TTLs, the function of which was split between two co-
TTLs.

Overly complex and confusing M&E system. EMTAP's project documents contain
multiple sets of somewhat differing indicators to track progress. While many of the
indicators were appropriate milestones, the large overall number and the lack of time
frame for their measurement resulted in a complex monitoring program that would not
provide information useful for assessing progress.

Country ownership for several components was not ensured. Only two of the five
initially designated substantive components started implementation relatively soon after
effectiveness (and even then 14 months after effectiveness). The others were delayed
well into 2006 and even 2007, owing to difficulties encountered by the implementing
agencies in processing their TPPs.

While the overall time for preparation was adequate, it is apparent that with regard to
Components 1 (unallocated), 4 (ICT), and 5 (Strategic Communication) that more time
would have been useful in order to verify and strengthen government commitment,
including ensuring that the TPP approval process was well advanced if not completed.
However, the Task Team was acting under time pressures tied to utilizing grant funds
which would become unavailable after FY04 while at the same time the Government had
requested the use of grant funds for technical assistance. In the case of component 1,
while the Ministry of Finance was keen for an unallocated reserve to be available, the
other central management ministries mentioned in the PAD do not seem to have
appreciated its existence, or cared to utilize its resources.

The project underwent a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7) in July 2005 which rated
EMTAP overall as moderately unsatisfactory, the only project of 25 randomly selected
projects in the SAR region for QEA7 (FY 04-05) to be rated as below moderately
satisfactory. The major criticisms from QAG were:
     There was lack of defined goals in the unallocated Component 1.
     Guiding principles/selection criteria needed to be more tightly defined.
     Risk of client pressures for sub-optimal activities may detract from project
        objectives.
     The five components did not comprise a tightly linked, coherent program for
        economic management.
     Support for PRSP and DSCs is barely visible in the project's contents
     Project's size and timing driven by the availability of $20 million of IDA grants in
        FY04
     Project was not ready for implementation, and project launch was delayed
     Inadequate attention was paid to social development issues


                                           13
      There was no FM assessment
      There was little value added from management

QAG's findings were strongly challenged by the Task Team, with country management
concurrence. The Team argued that the flexibility of Component 1 was a strength given
that previous TA projects had been over-specified, necessitating restructuring, and that it
would fill in gaps not covered by other donor programs. EMTAP was not created to
capture IDA grant funds, but had originally been proposed as a FY04 credit operation,
and its size was determined by aggregating the components. The Coordination burden
was not expected to be heavy, and the slow start reflected the good practice of following
country systems.

The ICR concurs with most of the QAG's findings, though the three criticisms
concerning lack of attention to social development, lack of an FM assessment, and lack of
management involvement were inaccurate. We also assess that the preparation of
EMTAP occurred not simply to access grant funds, though the processing of the project
at the end was fast-tracked in order to secure the grant funding.

QAG's findings came out too late to affect design. But they should have alerted Bank
management to the project's vulnerabilities, and the importance of a timely MTR to
consider restructuring.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Unsatisfactory


There were pockets of strong, quality effort on the part of several of the TTLs to make
the overall design and specific sub-components work. Bank staff made sustained efforts
to try to redress the slowness of implementation, exhorting government to secure
approval of TPPs and providing detailed proposals on work planning, staffing, and
administrative arrangements to be undertaken. However, supervision was poor overall in
addressing systemically the project design's shortcomings and slow implementation. The
Bank failed to carry out a mid-term review (MTR), did not follow up on the largely valid
critique from QAG, and did not consider a restructuring. Finally, the closing of the
project was not well handled.

The Task Team never stepped back to consider addressing the structural problems of the
project, nor did it have in place an effective monitoring framework that would measure
progress to signal the need for restructuring. The MTR was scheduled for August 2006,
but was postponed due to the anticipated change in government and then during the
Caretaker Government period. When elected government finally returned in 2009 an
MTR was not relevant. Political issues should not have derailed the MTR for a TA
project in different agencies which was clearly facing challenges.




                                            14
The Bank was not responsive in approving a request to develop trade negotiation capacity
under Component 1, though this activity had been flagged as a possible sub-component in
the PAD and Grant Agreement in 2004 and a June 2008 Aide Memoire from the Bank
noted that such a proposal was well-prepared, imminent and important.

Supervision suffered from a haphazard monitoring framework. ISRs rated each of the
components in general, but tracked relatively few results indicators. ISRs tracked
different sets of indicators. Ratings until the final ISR, when the overall TTL had
changed, appear higher than warranted.

Supervision to ensure quality of technical inputs from consultants hired on the project
was satisfactory on all components except the revenue mobilization component, where
there was reportedly no review of the reports prior to their acceptance by NBR.
Reluctance of NBR to share copies of the reports with the Bank was a factor.
The end of the project and the post-project transition were contentious. As activities
began to accelerate in 2008 concern arose about the need for sufficient time to complete
them. ERD sent a written request for a two year extension to the Country Director in
December 2008. The Bank's response was not coherent. Management did not send an
official reply but reportedly told ERD officials that an extension would not be granted.
However, the overall and component TTLs suggested that an extension would be possible
if disbursements accelerated. In July 2009 a component TTL wrote that the Bank `was
agreeable to an extension' for two years (though this was specifically in relation to an
amended TPP) and the overall co-TTL asked for work plans for all components in the
event of an extension. Nearly all PDs noted that they had received signals from the Bank
that an extension was likely and were critical of the manner in which the project was
closed. The Completion Report submitted by ERD also noted that the closure of EMTAP
was `abrupt.' The CD ultimately sent written confirmation to ERD that no extension
would be forthcoming only in early November 2009.
Interviewed TTLs stressed that they had understood that an extension was indeed
possible, at least for performing components. This misunderstanding was surprising
since there had been an announcement of regional policy to be more rigorous in not
allowing extensions. As late as October 2009 the Task Team submitted a memo to
country management proposing a partial extension of several components.
The Bank cancelled EMTAP prior to the end date which would allow for recommitting
funds quickly under newly promulgated guidelines. However, not all internal processes
were completed, which meant that funds did not become available for recommitment in
early 2010 as had been hoped in the case of the ICT component.

A key factor negatively impacting the Bank's performance was the sheer number of
individuals involved in supervision and the transfer of key individuals and
responsibilities at key junctures, including due to the unfortunate death of the Dhaka-
based co-TTL in 2007. There were co-TTLs for the overall project in Dhaka and
Washington as well as TTLs for each component, with corresponding separate lines of
communication with the counterpart. The project required substantial supervision
involvement with high transaction costs, yet was small and one of several duties for the
TTLs involved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The omissions in design, uneven implementation supervision, failure to hold a MTR and
restructure, and mishandling of the extension request yield a rating of unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Government's performance was unsatisfactory through much of the life of EMTAP,
but there was improvement in the last two years that was sufficient to raise the overall
rating to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).

The major problems with the Project were the lack of commitment and ownership, the
onerous TPP process, lack of readiness for implementation and appointment of staff for
most components, and the lack of timely resolution of implementation issues after the
start.

Monitoring and evaluation suffered from the lack of a coherent, focused set of indicators.
When queried about performance on their components, most Project Directors
understood that the measurement of performance was the extent to which the budget had
been spent, and not impact or achievement of development objectives.

Financial management appeared to be satisfactory. Quarterly financial reporting was
adequate and mostly timely during the project, although at the time of writing in late May
2010 the Bank has still not received consolidated quarterly reports from ERD for the final
two quarters, which ERD notes is due to slow submission from other implementation
agencies. The only procurement issue on record concerns some irregularities identified
by the Bank in the revenue mobilization component.

There is effort by the GoB to utilize some aspects of assistance provided by EMTAP
following the end of the project. ICT systems in NBR are reportedly in use where
installed and consideration is being given to designate a Board Member responsible for
legal and ICT matters. Plans are in place to continue twinning for ICAB on financial
reporting (though funding is in question) and a revision of the Financial Reporting Bill
with retention of substantive inputs from the project will be considered.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

There were a total of 11 implementing agencies, of which five were sub-components of
Component 1 (the unallocated pool). Some of the ratings for components, particularly
the late-starting sub-components 1.3 and 1.5, reflect the fact that key activities were not



                                            16
completed because the project ended earlier than component project directors had
expected due to the non-extension. Had there been an extension, the ratings would likely
be higher as these (sub)components appeared to be operating fairly well.

Component 1: Unallocated

Subcomponent 1.1. Chittagong Port Authority

Rating: Satisfactory.

This was a small subcomponent of under $300,000 to carry out a feasibility study for an
inland container depot for the Chittagong Port Authority. The study was completed
apparently on time and endorsed by World Bank staff as being of good quality, though
whether construction occurred is not known.

Subcomponent 1.2. Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Department,
Planning Commission
Rating: Satisfactory.

A short study on e-procurement was produced that Bank staff noted was then utilized in
preparing a Bank-funded investment project on improving procurement.

Subcomponent 1.3. Public Accounts Committee

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

This project was late in getting its TPP approved in 2006. Shortly after approval, the
Caretaker Government emerged where there was no Parliament and hence no activity.
Activity therefore started only in 2009, with satisfactory performance in conducting a
study tour and preparation for more intensive capacity building. The lack of readiness at
implementation, the slowness of starting, and the limited results in one year of activity
were significant problems.

Subcomponent 1.4. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)

Rating: Satisfactory.

The only significant issue with this sub-component was its late start. At the time of the
signing of the grant agreement it was anticipated that a portion of the unallocated funds
would go to supporting the BBS, but adoption of the TPP occurred only in early 2008.
Upon the launch of the project, rapid work was done to develop the methodologies and
produce the five different statistical reports (albeit actual publication occurred a few
months after the formal end of the project and therefore paid for by non-project funds
from the Government).

Subcomponent 1.5. Bangladesh Public Services Commission (BPSC)



                                           17
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

This sub-component's TPP was approved only in March 2008 (notably for a three-year
project while there was less than two years left in EMTAP). The ensuing nine months
were spent on hiring financial and procurement staff as well as a lead consultant who
drafted TORs for a series of consultants to help with organizational restructuring,
curriculum, ICT, examination management, and others. BPSC faced problems with
hiring and turnover of staff, especially its procurement consultant who could handle
World Bank procedures which were new to BPSC. Its Project Director noted that he was
burdened with numerous other duties and found it difficult to pay necessary attention to
administering the sub-component. The lead consultant produced TOR over the initial
months of 2009 and procurement was in advanced stage when BPSC was informed that
there would be no extension of the project in November 2009. This resulted in
procurement plans being shelved.

Component 2. National Board of Revenue

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Implementing Agency had its TPP processed relatively quickly and was ready for
implementation. It carried out the procurement plan for the component, though IT
equipment was procured only at the end of the project. It commissioned 23 consultant
reports on various organizational aspects (HRM, ICT, and others) as well as revenue
policy matters, such as VAT, which were mostly completed in 2008. However, no major
changes occurred in the operations of NBR that are attributable to EMTAP, though some
consideration is now being given to making a Board member responsible for IT and legal
affairs, which was one recommendation previously given. In addition, there were
irregularities identified with a set of procurements which are under review.

Component 3A. Finance Division, Ministry of Finance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Finance Division utilized consultants' assistance to draft a financial reporting law for
corporate entities, but time did not permit for the 8th Parliament to adopt it before the end
of 2006. The Caretaker Government passed it as an Ordinance, but this was allowed to
lapse by the new elected government in 2009. The current Cabinet rejected the bill on
grounds that some provisions should be in rules rather than an act; the Finance Division
is revising the bill and expects passage in 2010. Because there is no Act, work could not
proceed on capacity building for the Financial Reporting Council envisioned in the Act.
However, these were circumstances beyond the implementing agency's control.

Component 3B. Ministry of Commerce

Rating: Satisfactory



                                             18
A successful twinning arrangement was established between the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of England and Wales on the one side and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) and and the Institute of Cost and Management
Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB) on the other. Quality training was delivered,
curricula and exam standards were upgraded, and a strategic plan for ICMAB was
developed. The twinning arrangements have largely continued even after EMTAP closed
and external funding was been cut off. The Ministry of Commerce was the Government
agency, but in effect ICAB and ICMAB implemented much of this work.

Component 4. Bangladesh Computer Council, Ministry of Science and Information
and Communication Technologies

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This component had a slow start and suffered from substantial turnover of project
management staff. It commissioned three major reports on ICT-related matters, but the
Project Director who worked from 2008 to the end of the project assessed them to be of
insufficient quality to be utilized, particularly in the Government's updated ICT Strategy
in 2009. However, consultant resources to develop and conduct large-scale training of
2500 officials, mostly from outside of the capital, were efficiently utilized. A change in
equipment to be procuredled to delays in procuring IT equipment, which was the bulk of
the component's expenditures.

Component 5. Press Information Department, Ministry of Information

Rating: Unsatisfactory

A TPP was approved for this component only in 2007 and expenditures were authorized
only in a revision of the country's ADP in March 2008 and, except for some four
seminars, there were apparently no activities. It suffered from significant staff turnover
as well as difficulties in processing procurement following World Bank guidelines. No
consultants ended up being procured, and a Strategic Communications Unit (SCU) in the
Press Information Department (PID) was not established..

Component 6 and Overall Coordination Economic Relations Department, Ministry
of Finance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

This rating primarily rates to ERD's functioning as the overall coordinating body for
EMTAP, though it did carry out adequately its small $160,000 component involving
purchase of equipment and hiring of consultants. Until 2007 ERD's performance was
unsatisfactory. With the appointment of a full-time PD, decentralization of accounts,
more regular reviews in 2007, ERD's performance became moderately satisfactory
though it still had limited ability to enforce better execution among the IAs. Given its



                                           19
usual functions, it was unrealistic to expect ERD to be able to accelerate implementation
of slow-moving components or provide consultative services to improve management.
Nonetheless more vigorous coordination by ERD was anticipated in the project design.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

A number of implementing agencies performed satisfactorily, and it appears plausible
that with an extension, or other provision of sustained support to complete activities, the
ratings of some of the other agencies would have improved. However, the overall
performance marked by a late start, mostly incomplete activities, and limited impacts
yield a moderately unsatisfactory rating.

6. Lessons Learned

The experience of EMTAP suggests the following lessons:

   1. An umbrella TA project may be justified as a means of packaging several TA
      activities, but it should have an outcome greater than simply the sum of its
      parts. There should be is an underlying coherent objective that ties components,
      otherwise they increase transaction costs and diffuse responsibility. EMTAP had
      a PDO which promised this, but there was a disconnect between the components,
      which collectively provided no synergy, and the broader vision of improving the
      functioning of core government agencies. ERD played a coordinating role, but it
      was never going to be able to be substantively involved or effectively push
      implementation of the individual components. It essentially served as a go-
      between which increased transaction costs for Government and the Bank.

   2. Umbrella projects are difficult in the absence of strong country capacity to
      implement and hence require substantial implementation support. This is
      particularly the case with EMTAP, which included an unallocated component for
      small additional projects. They require sustained on-the-spot project leadership
      from the Bank's side, to quickly assess new proposals, guide counterparts through
      Bank processes, and help maintain momentum. In the absence of strong
      government capacity to lead the project, each (sub)component was essentially left
      to its own devices with mixed results. The relatively small size of the project
      belied its complexity. There were over 40 sub-activities in EMTAP to ensure
      went forward. The drain on staff time for implementation support for small sub-
      projects was significant. At the same

   3. While moving quickly to deliver a project for the client and secure grant
      funds was warranted, more care was needed to ensure smooth
      implementation, e.g. country ownership and clear administrative
      arrangements. The evidence is that most of the problems that affected project
      implementation were flagged either by the team or peer reviewers, but were not



                                            20
       paid sufficient attention. Most critically, at some point in the design process
       ownership by implementing agencies (in contrast to the commitment of the
       primary client, the Ministry of Finance) seems to have fallen behind, as the team
       fast tracked preparation.

   4. Bank staff and management need to be proactive in overseeing complex TA
      projects like EMTAP. Management and the Task Team did not choose to follow
      up on the critical (but largely correct) QAG quality at entry assessment even when
      the points made were still valid more than a year later. Management did not insist
      on a timely MTR and restructuring. ISRs gave moderately satisfactory ratings
      when there were actually major implementation shortcomings which were clear
      from Aides Memoires. The decision regarding the end of the project needed to be
      taken and clearly communicated with sufficient timeliness.

   5. Country systems need to be fully understood if they are to be incorporated
      into design. The team was aware that components would be subject to the TPP
      approval process, and made suggestions as to how that process could be
      simplified. In the event, improvements were not taken up, and the slow working
      of TPPs was one of the main factors in unsatisfactory project performance.

   6. There are existing public administration constraints to how effectively a
      Government uses external TA. Bangladesh civil service's frequent rotation of
      staff undermines continuity of management, resulting in implementation delays.
      The practice of embedding project component management in existing agency
      structures is in principle sound, but in practice is undermined by counterpart staff
      holding several jobs at the same time, leading them to see project management as
      an extra responsibility. The procurement of consultant studies, training, and ICT
      purchases should be routine functions of Government agencies, but were viewed
      additional burdens. Awareness of these constraints should inform the future
      design of projects.

   7. M&E systems need to be simple and meaningful. A diversified TA project
      with components of modest size and dependent on country systems for
      implementation can become unwieldy and beyond implementing agency
      capacity, if the Bank's standard approach to M&E is applied to each component.
      Furthermore, applying the Bank's results based approach to monitoring a project
      where the focus is on improving the machinery of government (as opposed to
      direct service delivery) is inherently difficult.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 was an unallocated component which eventually funded five small
subcomponents.

Component 1.1: Feasibility Study of ICD in Gazipur Dhirasram

Under EMTAP $0.6 million was proposed to develop project concepts for possible IDA
funding in the Rail and Port transport sub-sector for strengthening capacity of Chittagong
Port Authority (CPA) and Bangladesh Railway. GOB had emphasized the urgency of
providing cost-effective, reliable and efficient container transport of Dhaka-Chittagong
corridor. The feasibility study, was to provide a well-focused operational and commercial
plan for improving the capacity, reliability and financial performance of rail container;
identify and evaluate in financial and economic terms, the optimum investment program
necessary to deliver of the operational and commercial plan.

Component 1.2: Electronic Government Procurement Project (E-GP)

This report electronic Government Procurement (e-GP) Readiness Assessment was
conducted in Bangladesh during the period 17-28 January 2006. It is the first step in an e-
GP Assessment and Implementation Project to develop an e-GP Implementation Plan for
Bangladesh. The report looked at Government leadership, human resource management,
strategic planning, policy, legislation and regulations, infrastructure and private sector
integration to provide recommendation for each component.

Component 1.3: Strengthening Public Accounts Committee (PAC)

The Parliament was suspended for over two years during the Caretaker Government
period. After Parliament reconvened in February 2009 one study tour and a few
seminar/workshops were organized for the PAC members. Procurement of goods for
PAC took place.

Component 1.4: Strengthening Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC)

The component delivered guidelines for `On-the-job Training on Examination
Management' and guidelines for conducting interviews for the BCS examination.
Content for brochure/leaflet/BPSC's website were developed highlighting the mandate,
activities and performance of BPSC. The lead Consultant who was responsible for hiring
other consultants for survey, organizational restructuring, curriculum development,
policy guidelines and strategic implementation plan for local and foreign training had
prepared the Terms of References for respective assignments, but procurement of these
services was cancelled due to the ending of EMTAP. The consultant has also produced

guidelines for conducting interviews, evaluation mechanism for training, seminars and
workshops.

Component 1.5: Capacity Building of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)

The component produced four studies that were conducted by Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics. The studies used new methodologies for the surveys conducted through which
capacity of the Bureau was enhanced. BBS has produced "Bangladesh Standard
Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities" and published it in September 2009.
It also conducted "Welfare Monitoring Survey" and "Employment Monitoring Survey"
that were published in early 2010. Two other studies were initiated within the project,
the. Environmental Compendium and Gender Compendium. These are substantively
completed but remain to be published.

Component 2: Modernization and Automation Project (MAP) of National Board of
Revenue (NBR)

This component had eight sub-components that aimed to improve NBR's organizational
arrangements along with some modernization and automation to improve and strengthen
its core functions. Consultants were hired to identify weaknesses and provide
recommendations. The following reports were produced in an effort to obtain project
objectives:
     1. Identification of weaknesses in the Revenue Systems and procedures
     2. Revenue Audit Concept and Procedures
     3. ICT's Role in the management of VAT
     4. Improvement in Customs system Operations
     5. ICT Strategy and Vision for NBR
     6. `Taxpayer identification Number'- Concept and Strategy
     7. New ICT Setup for NBR and Its Field Offices
     8. Existing Post Clearance Audit Systems and Recommendations for Preparation of
         Post Clearance Audit Manual for Customs
     9. Modernization and Automation project (MAP)
     10. Income Tax
     11. Training modules for Academies of NBR
     12. Modernization and Automation of VAT System in Bangladesh

NBR staff cited that in fact 23 reports had been produced for NBR. The authors were
unable to ascertain the reason for the discrepancy.

Component 3A: Strengthening Accounting and Auditing Practices in Corporate Sector
(Ministry of Finance)

The component financed consultant's service to draft a financial reporting law for
corporate entities, which was eventually passed as an ordinance by the Caretaker
Government. The current elected Government however did not make the ordinance a law
and let it lapse. In absence of the Law, the Financial reporting Council was not



                                           26
constituted as planned initially. The Finance Division states that it is now working on a
revision that retains the substance of the drafted legislation and anticipates its passage.

Component 3B: Strengthening Accounting and Auditing Practices in Corporate Sector
(Ministry of Commerce)

The project supported a partnership between institute of Chartered Accountants of
England and Wales with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB)
and institute of cost and Management accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB). Trainings
were conducted for Accountants, and the curricula were upgraded. A strategic plan for
ICMAB was also developed as part of the component.

Component 4: Support for Development of Public Sector Use of ICT (MOSICT)

The project financed three reports on ICT policy, national roadmap and e-governance that
were outsourced to international consultants. Trainings were organized by Malaysian
University. Tenders for networking and datacenter were floated, however the project
closed before the contract could be awarded. Government awarded the contract
eventually using GOB funds.

Component 5: Strengthening Development Communication between Government
Stakeholders (PID)

Under this component six national level seminar/workshops were conducted, organized
by Press Information Department (PID) that were aimed to inform and sensitize people
about the development initiatives of the Government. Nine other regional
seminar/workshops were also held to expand the reach of Government communications.
The component funded production of broadcasting materials, reports, video films,
documentaries and other communication tools that informed the citizens about
Government's reform initiatives. Interviews and Press conference organized by PID
helped exchange of opinion on reform activities and to provide feedback. Public
Relations officers who are placed at different Ministries were provided with computers to
enhance communication within and outside the Government. No Strategic
Communication Unit was established

Component 6: Central Coordination and Management of EMTAP, ERD

ERD played a coordination role in managing the entire umbrella project EMTAP.
Therefore, it maintained the foreign currency account and ensured smooth flow of fund to
individual implementing agencies. ERD was also responsible for financial reporting to
World Bank on quarterly basis for all components and thus produced quarterly financial
reports for the Bank.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

A quantitative economic and financial analysis was not justified or feasible for this
technical assistance project because it is difficult to value the long-term benefits of
investment in institutional strengthening and capacity building, including human capital,
in Government and some private professional and education institutions. These
investments are expected to enhance effectiveness and productivity, and hence lead to a
higher growth and poverty reduction impact of Government policies, spending and
activities. The project investment was expected to have high, though not easily
quantified, economic and social returns.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower's ICR

The Borrow did not submit a consolidated ICR; ERD did not take action to collect or
consolidate the reports. The Bank requested from individual IAs a completion report in
March and again in April 2010. As of the time of writing completion reports were
received from the PAC, the BPSC, the Ministry of Information, and ERD, though other
agencies committed to sending their completion reports shortly. The completion reports
with one exception follow GoB formats, as is appropriate. This format summarizes
important dates and implementation of procurement plans but has little qualitative
assessment of the project outcome and performance. The exception is the BPSC's report,
which contains several useful qualitative assessmens.

Strengthening Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Component:

The component commenced in September 2006 and completed in December 2009.
Bangladesh Parliament Secretariat was the implementing agency. The project was
initiated at a time when the Parliament was suspended due to which there was no PAC.
As a result of this the project implementation was very little. During the span of three
years there had been three project directors which hampered the activities of the project.
However after the 9th Parliamentary Election in December 2008 and constitution of PAC,
some study tours, workshop/seminars were organized for the PAC members.
Procurement of goods for the Committee took place in the duration. The Project Director
felt that had the component had more time, it would be possible to gear up the activities.
The current PAC Chairman is determined to reform the institution and would have
benefitted from the Bank financed project. The overall assessment of the objective,
design and implementation was satisfactory, however the outcome of the project could
not be attained as it could not be implemented in absence of a Public Accounts
Committee for almost the entire project period.

Strengthening Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC) Component:

The project had a much delayed start. The entire first year was lost in recruiting Finance
and Accounts Specialist, procurement consultant and the lead consultant. The project
really started in Jan 2009 after the lead consultant joined.

During the WB Review mission in Feb 2009, an extension was requested. Bank
responded that it considers extension requests only six months prior to the completion
date. Considering the fast progress in the last few months of the project, it was reasonable
expected that extension would be allowed.

The completion report assesses the objectives of the project to be well defined, however,
specific objectives could be focused more to give better clarity for specific components
of the project. Evaluation of operational experience highlighted lack of understanding
within BPSC about the project concept that resulted in lack of ownership. They were also



                                            32
not well informed about the outcome or the benefit of the project. Too many stages in the
decision making process of the BPSC often slowed down the project implementation.

The report pointed out that meaningful assessment of the outcome of the operation against
the agreed objectives is not possible as the project ended before it could produce any output
agreed in the PAD. Assessment on local training, study tour and seminars and workshops
was satisfactory.

ERD found that the project had unrealistic time frame to start with. In addition to that, it
was hurriedly prepared with many inadequacies. The existence of resistance to change
within BPSC was substantial and needed to be addressed. Having only a part time project
director, who has other responsibilities, hampered the progress of implementation. And
finally, there was lack of ownership of the project as BPSC officials were not clear about
the project objectives.

Strengthening Development Communication between Government Stakeholders (PID)
Component:

The project was initiated in January 2007 and ended in December 2009. During its
tenure, the project held seminars/workshops, developed communication materials and
conducted M&E mission participated by the Ministry of Information's planning cell,
IMED and ERD. The outcome of the project include enhanced communication with
citizens about the Government's reform initiatives. The project also developed capacity
within the implementing agency. The major achievement of the project is enhanced
capacity and efficiency of the information officers and the mass campaign conducted to
raise awareness. The project could not achieve all its intended objectives due to closing
of the project in December 2009. The team also felt that the budget was insufficient for
all the activities planned initially in the project design. While the component took three
years to be initiated, the team had decided to restructure the component in July 2009 by
scaling down the scope of the component. A scaled down structure was decided and
agreed upon by the Steering Committee. However the project ended within six months of
restructuring and thus the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives had
enormous gaps.

Central coordination and Management of EMTAP, ERD Component:

    Under EMTAP umbrella project, 11 sub-projects had been undertaken including
the Central Coordinating Unit located in ERD. The project failed to utilize 100%
grant finance in its estimated project life. The reasons primarily outlined for this is
many of its components began only in 2007 and 2008 whereas the DGA was
signed in June 2004. It took two and a half years to get the final financial
arrangement with 100% Bank's grant funding as opposed to the initial WB:GOB
80%:20% arrangement. New financial arrangements were introduced in January
2007 to speed implementation




                                             33
Some components were unable to attain the agreed objectives and consequently
failed to achieve outcomes. The Strengthening Public Accounts Committee
component in particular had slow progress until the convening of the current
Parliament when it obtained momentum. Other components would have achieved
full objectives with even only a six-month extension: the Capacity Building for the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, and the Bangladesh Computer Council's project.
The abrupt closure of EMTAP meant that these two components couldn't finish
ongoing activities, including some major procurements.

Comments on Draft ICR

The draft ICR was circulated on June 15, 2010 to the project directors of each of the
implementing agencies as well as to ERD in its role as a coordinator for EMTAP. A
deadline of two weeks to provide comments and feedback was given. As of June 29,
written comments were received only from ERD and the Press Information Department
of the Ministry of Information (MoI-PID).

ERD expressed broad agreement with the ICR's findings with the exception of the rating
given to its performance. Its comments centered on its role as a coordinator which did
not carry with it authority to enforce implementation of the project. The ICR's authors
concur that ERD's mandate made it unreasonable to expect it to ensure implementation
of EMTAP's various components; however the overall design of the project intended that
a more robust coordination role nonetheless be undertaken by ERD. Discussion of this
issue is reflected in the main text.

The MoI-PID's comments provided additional information emphasizing that the PID
itself was the implementing agency and the on activities

                                      on
           Economic Management Technical Assistance Project (EMTAP)
                             Date: June 15, 2010


        The Economic Relations Division acted as the "Coordinator" for all sub-projects
and "Managed the DOSA fund on behalf of all sub-projects". Before placing the detail
opinion on the report the Economic Relations Division would like to explain the term
`Coordinator' and the issue of `management of the DOSA fund' a little further for a
better understanding about the project mechanism.

02.     According to the existing Rules of Business, the concerned Secretary is the
Principal Accounting Officer for all the projects to be implemented under the jurisdiction
of his/her Ministry/Division. EMTAP was an umbrella project having eleven sub-projects
in various Ministry/Division. All these sub-projects were independent, separate entities,
individually approved by the competent authorities and included discretely into the
Annual Development Program. So, the responsibility of implementing these sub-projects
lay with the concerned Ministry/Division, and ERD had little control over the
implementation progress of individual sub-projects, as they were under the jurisdiction of
independent Ministry/Division. ERD played the role of gathering information and
sending the compiled report to the World Bank, to facilitate the execution of sub-projects.
The Bank's Report (page 17) concedes that              "Given its usual function, it was
unrealistic to expect ERD to be able to accelerate implementation of slow-moving
components or provide consultative services to improve management."- which is very
correct. Therefore, the rating of ERD as "Moderately Unsatisfactory" as Coordinator to
various sub-projects is strong and unfair.

03.     However, the ERD arranged several workshops to make project personnel of sub-
projects aware of common procedural mistakes in procurement processing and to share
the best practices among the sub-projects. ERD organized monthly coordination meeting
with the active participation of all Project Directors to review the implementation
progress and to suggest the probable solutions. The report reveals (page18), "ERD played
a coordination role, but it was never going to be able to be substantively involved or
effectively push implementation of the individual components. It essentially served as a
go-between which increased transaction cost for Government and the Bank." If ERD
was not there as coordinator, someone would have to play the role of coordinator to make
the interface between the Bank and the sub-projects. It would be highly difficult for the
Bank to effectively communicate with all 11 sub-projects and maintain 11 DOSA
accounts to ensure the individual payment flow. Moreover the ERD component was only
paltry amount of USD 0.132 million (though it is wrongly mentioned as 0.16 million),
which is too small an amount to be considered as transaction cost increase.



                                            35
04.   The report entails (in page 6 Component 6) that ......ERD responsible for
managing the overall implementation of the project, which is not a correct statement.
The Rules of Business of the Bangladesh Government does not allow ERD to enforce
implementation progress in other Ministry/Division's components.

05.     In page 5 Component 1, it depicts that .....in general Component-1 sub-project
proposals were slow in coming forth and Bank and ERD staff had to actively canvas
agencies to submit proposals. It is not a fact that ERD did not canvas enough, rather it
sent two important projects namely "Establishment of the Trade Portal in the Export
Promotion Bureau" and "Capacity Building of ERD", which could not come into being
due to lack of decision from the Bank.

06.    In the Borrower Performance Section 5.2 of the report suggests that financial
management appeared to be satisfactory. Quarterly financial reporting was adequate
and mostly timely during the project, although at the time of writing in late May 2010
the Bank still not received consolidated quarterly reports from ERD for final two
quarters. ERD requested all the sub-projects repeatedly to submit their individual FMR
to ERD, but due to complexities regarding the final payments of many packages in
various sub-projects it was not possible to compile them during the said period.

07.    ERD broadly agrees with the report findings including the remarks on the sudden
closure of the project, however ERD requests the ICR team to review the ERD's rating
from "Moderately Unsatisfactory" to an upscaled rating.

To improve capacities and efficiencies, the Press Information Department under the
project component procured 50 (fifty) computers & accessories and distributed the
computers & accessories among the Information Officers, Senior Information Officers,
other PID officials attached to different ministries and divisions of the government.
Opportunities and impacts were created among the PID officials to enhance their
computer literacy and establishing E-Network.

Three video films on Agricultural development planning, Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) and Right to Information Act were produced and
these films were exhibited among the common people throughout the country covering
64 districts, upazillas and villages by using the 69 mobile cinema units. Impacts were
created among the common people in using ICT tools and access to information for their
socio-economic upliftment.

Under the project component twenty-four Radio talks and five TV talk shows on different
development programs and reforms agenda including environment, Information
Technology, climate change etc. were produced and broadcast through the national Radio
and Television channels which covered the whole country for dissemination of
information among the people. Impacts were created among the common people in
familiarizing with ICT tools, adaptation in climate change and motivated people in
implementing the Government's development priority issues.

Besides five print reports, two audio reports and one video report on different
development reform issues like climate change, Information and Communication
Technology, disaster management, environment etc. were prepared and disseminated
through national Television and Radio channels and print media.




                                          37
Under the project component two interviews and two press conferences were organized
by PID on climate change issues and ICT and the message were disseminated among the
common people through different Television and Radio channels and national
newspapers. Impacts were created among the people about climate change issue and its
adverse effects and familiarizing the people with ICT.

Under the project, PID at its headquarters organized six seminars/workshop on
government's different development and priority issues like environment, Information
Technology, Vision 2010 etc. and also reforms agenda for which people, media
personnel, civil society members and PID officials were sensitized and exchanged views.
Regional information offices at Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna also organized nine
seminars/workshops on different developments and reforms agenda of the government
through which media personnel, civil society members and PID officials and other
government department's officials were sensitized and exchanged views. Under the
project sixty development features, twenty-four articles, thirty slogans, six cartoons on
poverty reduction, planned urbanization, reducing maternal mortality, birth registration,
ICT, environment, disaster management etc. were prepared and published in different
national and regional newspapers, periodicals through which people were more informed
and motivated in implementing the government development priorities and reforms
agenda aimed at poverty reduction and socio-economic upliftment of the common
people.
