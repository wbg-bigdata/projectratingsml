PROJECT COMPLET"ON REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Highway
Project in Sudan, for which Credit 882-SU In the amount of US$41.0 million
was approved on March 16, 1979. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1985,
six months behind schedul    It was disbursed to the amount of US$40.979
million and US$21,000 were cancelled.   The last payment was made on
September 17, 1985.
The PCR was preparod by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Eastern Africa Department, of the Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Su--try, Parts I and III).  On October 3, 1990, OED sent the
Borrower Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part II by November
15, but no reply ws8 received.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter-alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and a PCR
prepared by the Roads and Bridges Public Corporation.

SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 882-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The project objectives were to facilitate the transport and export
of agricultural production, to improve the accessibility of some highly
populated regions and to strengthen existing capacity of institutions
(Southern Regional Ministry of Communfcations, Transport and Roads
(SRMCTR)) in transport planning and maintenance operations (pars 3.01).
The project consisted oft
(a) the construction of the two lane bitumen road between Jebel Aulia
and Ed Dueim (158 kms), two ferries at Ed Dueim and a permanent
weighbridge;
(b) consulting services for (i) detailed engineering of the above road
construction; (ii) supervision of the above road section; and (iii)
detailed engineering of about 500 kms of roads; and
(c) assistance to the Roads Department in Southern Sudan by providing
technical assistance, construction of workshop and offices and the
procurement of equipment, spares and fuel (para 3.02).
Implementation Experience
The project successfully completed the physical work on the Jebel-
Aulia to Ed-Dueim road project, but the two ferries for the crossing of the
River Nile at Ed Dueim could not be completed due to lack of funds in the
Credit.     The  assistance  to  the  Southern  Regional  Ministry  of
Communications, Transport and Roads were faced with implementation
difficulties largely attributed to the civil unrest in the area and to
institutional problems resulting in lack of proper coordination between
Khartoum and Juba (section 5).
Major cost overruns were experienced on the civil works component.
This eventually resulted in arbitration. The payment of the arbitration is
dealt with under the Khartoum-Port Sudan Road Rehabilitation Project (IDA
Credit 2070-SU). The two ferries at Ed-Dueim had to be deleted from the
project due to lack of funds, but the ferries were included in the Third
Highway Project under which the ferries were successfully launched in May
1989 (para 5.05).



Results
The economic rate of return (ERR) of the principal project
compornet - I.e., the Jebel Aulia - Ed Dueim Road - at appraisal was
estimated *t 141.  The reestimatod ERR upon project completion is 14.52
(including arbitration awards) and 19.52 (excluding arbitration awards).
The cost turned out to be higher than estimated at appraisal but so wa the
volume of traffic using the road (section 7).
Sustainabilitv
The Jebel Aulia - Ed Dueim trunk road was completed soma six years
ago, has been well maintained since then, and is in good condition. Good
maintenance In the future seems likely given t..b important position of the
road in the Sudanese ighway system, which is well recognized by the
Government.   In addition,  the ThLrd Highway project,  in this context,
provides for development of an Improved pavement management system and an
increased effort at Axle Load limit control. This should further increase
the likelihood that the road will remain in good condition during its
projected lifetime. (para 7.06).
Findinns and Lessons Learned
The principal lossons to be loarned from the projoct experience
are:
(i) Supervision missions should be fielded at regular and shorter
Intervals so that Project Implementation Issues could be addressed
in a more timely manner.
(ii) Tighter monitoring of disbursements.
(iII) Since technical assistance was critical to implementation of the
Project, the Association should have made the hiring of
consultants a condition for credit effectiveness and subsequently
made provision for retroactive financing of the process.
(iv) The use of Bank's 1985 Sample Bidding Document (SBD), will reduce
the likelihood of bidding documents causing disagreements over the
interpretation of lmportant clauses (para 8.04).

2.       Backaround
2.01     At appraisal, the road network for Sudan consisted of a mere
16,000 km in a total area of 2.5 million sq.km. Consequently, the
development of the sector wa" recognized as a high priority in the 1971-75
Development Plan (later extended to 1977). Traditionally, railways
provided the primary mode of transport for movement of goods in and out of
the country. Howevor, as it was becoming increasingly difficult for the
railways to cope with expanding needs of the country, development of the
road network wa initiated with the construction of a highway between
Khartoum and Port Sudan. Subsequently, a six-year investment plan was
developed for improving the entire road network In an effort to Increase
the efficiency of the transport system by (i) providing an alternative to
the railways, (ii) improving short-haul transport of passengers and goods,
and (iiI) integrating the road network with the railways In order to
provide much needed transport services to the hinterland.
2.02     This Highway Project was the second IDA funded project in the
highway sub-sector. The Project helped the Government to Implement its
overall policy by financing a road that was defined as a priority road
under the six-year investment program for the bighway sub-sector. The
Project also made provision for technical assistance (TA) to the road
administration in Southern Sudan which, at that time, was recovering from
the civil war and had its whole network in very bad condition.
3.       Project Oblectives and Description
Prolect Ob1ectives
3.01     The Project objectives ware to facilitate the transport and export
of agricultural production, to Improve the accessibility of some highly



-2-
populated regions and to strengthen existing capacity of institutions
(Southern Regional Hinistry of Coemunicat-ns* Transport and Roads
(SRHCTR)) in transport planning and maintenance operations.
Proiect Descrigtion
3.02     The Project consisted of:
(a)   Construction of a two lane bituminous surfaced road between Jebel
Aulia and Ed Dusim (158 km) including an improved ferry crossing, two
ferries at Ed Dusim and a permanent weighbridge.
(b)   Consulting services fort
(i)   detailed englneering of the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road;
(1i1) supervision of construction of the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim
road; and
(iii) detailed engineering of about 500 km of roads to be
identified.
(c)   Assistance ln strengthening the SRMCTR's Roads Department by
provlslot of technical assistance (including housing and vehicles),
workshops, offices, equipment, spaces and fuel.
4.       Prcoict Desgin and Ortanization
4.01     The Project was designed to alleviate existing constraints
in the tra nsport sector by improving communtcations in the economlcally
important Nile Corridor. In addition, the Project design also focused on
increasing the efficiency of existing institutions responsible for
transport planning and operations. Given the fact that existing transport
syste  in the country were becoming a major constraint to economic growth,
the Project concept and design is considered timely and appropriate. The
Project was a follow-up of the Highway I Project. Feasibility studies for
the road component included under this Project were In fact completed under
the Highway I Project. Technical assistance to the Southern Region was
also a follow-up to the assistance extended under the Highway I Project.
4.02     In its earlier form, the Project called for the construction of a
road from Jebel Aulia to Rabak. The Project, as identified, called for
cofinancing by IDA, the Arab Fund and the AfDB. However, the scope of the
Project had to be reduced in 1978 as the Arab Fund was unable to
participate in the financing plan. The road construction component was
reduced to the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim section. At a later stage, it was
agreed that the total financing requirements for the Project would be
provided by IDA and that AfDB funds, earlier earmarked for this Project,
would be utilized by the Government for financ.ng other projects in its
investment program.



-3-
4.3 U    Under this Project, the responsibility for implementation of the
civil works component consisting of construction of the Jebel Auila-Ed
Dueim road and engineering of about 500 km of additional roads was assigned
to the Roads and Bridges Public Corporation (RBPC). The actual work was to
be carried out by consultants &A, contractors under the ,upervision of
RBPC. The SRMCTR was responsible for the implementationt of the Technical
Assistance component in the South involving recruitment of expatriate
advisers.
4.04     The scope c: the Project and the institutional arrangements for
Implementation as envisaged during appraisal were reasonable.
Implementation difficulties as alluded to below, were largely influenced by
exogenous factors relating to the overall country situation which would
have been difficult to anticipate during the preparation of the Project.
5.       Prolect Implementation & Results
5.01     Project Implementation was slow in starting. Although the Credit
Agreement was signed on July 16, 1979, credit effectiveness was postponed
three times and was not concluded until January 1980. Compared to the
original implementation schedule, there were delays in commencement of
Implementation on all components of the Project. This was generally a
result of the Government's and the Agencies' slow decision making process.
After the evaluation of the bids for the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road had been
completed in July 1979, it took seven months to award the contract to the
lowest evaluated bidder.
(a)   Construction of the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim V  d
5.02     The bids for the road were reeeived in June 1979, the contract was
awarded in February 1980, construction started in late 198p and was
completed in August 1983, six months bd'hind contract schedule. Supervision
of the works was carried out by forelgrn consultants. As these consultants
were already established in Sudan, they were able to offer a competitive
proposal which resulted in supervision costs of US$1.20 million being lower
than the original estimate of US$1.5 million.
5.03     The main difficulties leading to delays in the construction were
due tot (i) the objection by the local population to the use of a gravel
pit located near the construction site. This resulted in shortages in
supply of gravel, as the contractor was forced to use more distant pits;
(iI) the initial design for the ferry causeway at Ed Dueim proved to be
inadequate. Additional works were needed in order to provide proper
reinforcements which resulted in major cost overruns; (iii) interruption
in the supply of fuel due to overall shortages in the country; and, (iv)
import restrictlons.
5.04      As compared to the orLgLnal contract sum of IS 11.79 million the
final costs for this component were estimated at £S 24 million, or an
increase of 109X. In March 1984, the Association stopped payment of the



-4-
foreign currency component of the certificates issued by the consultapt as
a result of funds for that component being totally depleted, Including
funds earltar earmarked for the provision of two ferries and a weigW#ridge.
5.05     The Project included the procurement of two forries for the
crossing of the Nile at Ed Duelm.  Because of cost overruns on the road
construction, this compon"nt was dropped from the Project. Instead, the
existing ferries were rehubilitated by the Government. The financing for
procurement of new ferries was subsequently included under the Third
Highway Project.
5.06     The procurement of a i rmanent weighbridge was also excluded from
the Project, due to shortage of funds.
(b)   Engineerint of about 500 km of Roads
5.07     Engineering studies for about 500 km of roads were to be carried
out under the Project. The roads were to be selected by the Government and
proposed to IDA for agreement before December 1979. However, the selection
was delayed as RBPC decided to wait for the completion of the Feeder Road
Master Plan Project (financed by the Bank under Technical Assistance
Project Cr 614-SU). Consequently, selection of the roads was finalized In
October 1980. The total length of roads selected amounted to 300 km (due
to increased consultancy costs, engineering studies had to be limited to
300 km instead of 500 km as originally planned). The roads lncluded: the
Um Rubaw&-El Obeid road (536 km), the Kashim K1 Kirba-New Halfa road or New
Halfa Road Schem  (96 ku) and the Dillipg-Rabilla road (52 km).
5.08     Proposals for conaultancy studies were received and evaluated by
June 1981. Contracts wero warded to a Lebanese firm In October 1981
for the studies of Un Rubawa-El Obeid and Dilling-Rabilla roads, and to en
Italian firm in November 1981 for the access road to the New Halfa Road
Scheme. The studies were completed by fall of 1982. The studies were
carried out satisfactorily. However, in the case of the Lebanese
consultants the Bank drew tho attention of the Government to the fact t*nt
tho standards used for the engineering studies were higner than thos4
recommended in the feaaibility study.
(c) Assistance to the Southern Resion
5.09     The second largest component of the Project was provision of
assistance to the Southern-Region. The assistance was composed of -
technical assistance to the SRMCTR to help it carry out its road
maintenance assignment, provision of maintenance equipment and spare parts,
construction and equipmeit of a central workshop in Juba, financing of some
of the fuel needs of the SRMCTRO and construction of housing and provision
of vehicles for the technical assistance team. The responsibility for
implementation of this component was assigned to the Southern Region
Ministry of Communications, Transportation and Roads; however after the
break up of the Southern Region, the newly formed ministry of Equatorial



-5-
region assumed Implementation responsibilities.
5.10     Implementation of this component experienced many delays
an a result of poor communication between Juba and Khartoum, which made
procurement difficult. Furthermore, due to poor communications and
transportation, IDA missions were not able to visit Juba until July 1981.
This proved to be very disrupting for the Project as oh. performance of
SRMCTR in implementing the Project could not be monitoreA effectively.
5.11     It was initially the intention of the Government to recruit
individuals to fill key posts In the SRMCTR. However, shortly after the
Credit became  ffectivi, the SRMCTR decided to appoint a consulting firm
instead.  The Bank, at the request of the SRMCTR, assisted in the selection
and appointment of consultants. The consultants wer hired in April 1981
and two members of the consultants team arrived in Juba in Hay 1981. Due
to lack of housing, the consultants were unable to field a full 10-man teem
for a full period as envisaged under the contract.
S.12     The consultants were confronted with adverso conditions. Apart
from transport and housing difficulties mentioned above, the consultants
had te put up with unsatisfactory security conditions and the
reorganization of the Southern Region. The reorganization diverted much of
the Government's tim away from the Project. These difficulties
considerably hindered overall Project Implementation.
5.13     Due to fimplementation problems and loss of time, the scope of
consultancy services had to be reduced. In November 1983, an amendment to
the credit agreement was signed requesting the consultant to concentrate
ont completion of the central workshop and stores, establishing a road
maintennce capability on the Juba-Haridi, Juba-Yei and Juba-Nimule
roads, assisting In strengthening the establishbent of tho throe regional
ministries, strengthening the Equatoria Ministry of Works and Construction
in planning and management and providing on-the-job training.
5.14     Tho consultants organiaed bids for the workshop on behalf of the
S8HCTR in early 1983. Only one bid was received In June and the contract
was awarded to a Kenyan firm In September 1983. With the agreement of IDA,
site clearance and building of the foundations ware conducted by the
regional ministry and completed by June 1984. The work on steel structures
and overhead cranes was completed by the contractor In February 1985.
5.15     In 1982 the consultants carried out a survey of SRNCTR's exi ting
road maintenance equipment In order to determine additional requirements
for equipment and spares. Procurement of equipment and spares was
initiated in late 1982. Overrun on other project components led to
shortage of funds and procurement was limited to an amount of $0.5 million
compered to an original allocation of $0.75 million. Most of the equipment
and spares were delivered by early 1985.
5.16     The Ansociation agreed to finance 802 of the increase of SRMCTR's
fuel expenditures for maintenance on a yearly basis. However,
due to delays in the lmplementation of the technical assistance program,
disbursements against these expenditures did not take place prior to-1982.
Taking into account the widespread shortage of fuel in-the country and the



-6-
lack rf adequate transport facilities to the south, the Association agreed
In October 1982 to finance 1002 of the road maintenance fuel requirements
for FY 1983 down to 852 in FY 1984. On this basis, 60,000 liters were
ordered in 1983 but only 12,000 were a^tually purchased. Figures are not
available for FY 1984.
5.17     At appraisal, the need wo urgently provide housing for the
technical assistance staff had been stressed, and a provision of US$
570,000 was made available for the construction of 10 houses. However, due
to various reasons explained below (para 5.18-5.19), it was not until
September 1982 that the works finally started.
5.18     Several attempts were made to initiate the construction of the
housing for the technical assistance teAm.  A first attempt in mid-1979 to
negotiate a contract with a foreign contractor failed (because the SRHCTR
could not make a quick decision and because of bad performance of the
contractor on other projects). In June 1981, local competitive bidding
(LCB) was initiated under the auspices of the local Housing Ministry but
all bids were returned because of long delays and high costs. Finally,
prefabricated houses were bought from a UK firm late 1981.
5.19     Further delay was caused by the late arrival of the houses in Juba
and indecision in the local Government about the erection of prefabricated
houses. However, by June 1984, all ten houses wore comploted end seven of
them were occupied. The last three could not be occupied due to damage and
theft of components while stored in containers on site. However, all of
the TA teem were housed in the seven houses.
5.20     Vehicles for the TA team were to be provided by the Regional
Ministry.  Procurement of six four-wheel drive Pusch ca 's and four
Volkswagen Golf were initiated in early 1981 for a cost of US$0.35 million
(US$0.21 million provided at appraisal). When the cars arrived in Juba the
Ministry began using the four wheel drive (Pusch) vehicles for other
purposes which hindered progress in the field work. However, as a result
of interventlon of IDA the TA team was later provided with adequate
transportation.
5.21     Technical assistance provided under the Project failed to
adequately strengthen the institutions responsible for road administration
in the Southern Regions. Of the three regions, Equatoria benefitted the
most from the TA component. Due to security reasons, the other two regions
of Bahr El Ghasal end Upper Nile received limited assistance under the
Project. (Although most of the equipment to be procured under the Project
was received and a maintenance manual was published, it is unlikely that
the Southern Region would have been able to sustain maintenance activities
on its own due to continuing lack of institutional capacity).
6.       Settlement of the Dispute between the GOS and the Contractor
6.01     Different interpretations of the clause governing foreign currency
payments resulted In a dispute between the GOS and the Contractor for the
Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road. The supervising consultant estimated foreign
currency payable to the contractor for the additional work he had



-7.
undertaken at the same exchange rate as the one defined for regular work in
the contract. The consultant based its estimate on a requirement in the
contract that 802 of every certificate should be payable in DM at the
exchange rate prevailing at the time of contract-signing (L.S. 1.00 - DM
5.788) although the exchange rate had gone down to L.S. 1.00 = DM 1.90 in
1985. The Government disagreed with the consultant's interpretation of the
relevant contract clause.
6.02     The matter was taken to arbitration in April 1989.  The
Arbitration Tribunal awarded the contractor the amount of DM 37.8 million
for the outstanding payments of construction works and interest through
April 1989.  An agreement was later reached by the two parties under which
it was agreed that a payment of DM 29 million will be made by the GOS to
the contractor withbn one year from the date of the agreement, and that
this would be considered full and final settlement of any outstanding
issues under the contract. The Government of Sudan requested IDA to
consider financing the sum of DM29 million. IDA has subsequently agreed to
include this cost-overrun in the Khartoum-Port Sudan Road Rehabilitation
Project (KPRP), Cr.2070-SU.
7.       Proiect's Benefits
7.01     A rate of return for the Project can only be calculated on
the benefits expected for the road construction; the benefits derived from
technical assistance and engineering can only be assessed in more genoral
terms. In so far as the engineering studies are concerned, the Dilling-
Habilia road has been constructed and is open to traffic; the other two
roads were still being studied in 1986 (Feeder Road Survey Review, 1986)
for inclusion in a project. The civil unrest in Southern Sudan pre-empts
any evaluation of the benefit for the technical assistance comp9nent.
7.02     The ERR calculated by the Bank at appraisal for the Project was
14S. The analysis was carried out over a 25-year period. The appraisal
method of evaeluation of benefits consisted of a comparison of vehicle
operating costs (VOC) with and without the Project on the Jebel Aulia-Ed
Dueim trunk road. Different VOC were applied to different sections of the
road depending on the conditions of the existing track. The benefits for
traffic generated by the road was assumed to be half tite unit benefits for
existing traffic. The traffic evaluation was based on a traffic survey
done in 1976 by BCEOM and the following growth rates were then applied:
light traffic, both existing and generated, was to grow by 92 each year and
other traffic was expected to grow by 7% each year. The cost comprised
construction cost and an overlay vhich would be required in 1992J93,
routine maintenance cost for the road and ferries, plus costs for the
refurbishing of the ferries and adding a third in 1992/93. The residual
value of the road in 2,003 was estimated at 25% of the construction costs.
7.03     The recalculation of the ERR has been done using the same method
as at the time of appraisal. Two rates of return have been computeds one
without taking into account the sum attributed to the contractor under the
settlement and the other by including the said sum to the construction
costs. The amount awarded to the contractor was expressed in 1983 prices
and then distributed yearly to the pro rata of disbursements for each

particular yeors
7.04     The benefits are baed on a comparison between operating costs of
vehicles using the old track, and using the new highway. The VOCI have
been actualized by using a survey made by consultants In 1986 and deflating
the VOC to 1983 level. The traffic estimates are based on a survey done by
the Governrmnt of Sudan In 1986. Th, figures have been taken back to 1983
by using the growth rates defined at appraisal. Th. generated traffic li
said to be the difference between the actual traffic in 1983 and the
traffic computed for 1983 at appraisal.
7.05     The Ell  thus calculated are of 14.52 for tbk option including
arbitration awards and 19.5X for the other option as compared to the
avpralsal estimat- of 142. Both rate of returns ar higher then the
appraisal estimates depite the higher costs and reduced *cop- of the
Projects this is mainly tho result of the high growth of traffic (generated
traffic Is about ten times the traffic estimated at appraisal). The rate
of return calculated with the arbitration option hs been tested for
overestimation of th generated traffic; results show that In the event of
benefita being 30S lower then actual, the rate of return would be 10.
ERR calculations are presented In PartII I,Tables 5 and 6.
2s talnabilitv
7.06     The Jebal Aulia - Ed Dueim trunk road wa  completed same six years
ago, ha  been well maintained since then, and Is In good condition. Good
maintenance in the future seem likely given the important position of the
road in the Sudanese highway system, which is well recognized by the
Government. In addition, the Third Highway project, in this content,
provides for development of en improved pavement management system and an
increased effort at Axle Load limit control. This should further increaso
the likelihood that the road will remain in good condition during Its
projected lifetime.
8.        eank's PErformane
8.01     The Association pravgdod valuable asistance to the Southern
Region in implementing the technical assistance program in its early stage.
It played a crucial role in identifying bottlnecks end proposang remedial
actions to be takon by the Implementing agencies. Glven the transport and
coumlcation difficulties that existed during tbh later implementation of
the Project, supervision of this part of the Project could hardly have been
more effectlve.  However, given the Inexperience of the SBRCT, during
projoet preparation, risks of delay LI Implementation should have been
highlighted and supervision missions could prhaps have been more vigilant
In monitoring SRNCTR implementation capacity.
8.02     The handling of payment to the construction contractor could have
been handled more carefully. Supervision mislons' reports were not
sufficiently clear about the fact thAt cost increaes for the road were
running high.
8.03     Timing of supervision mission (intervals between missions) was
rather erratic (ranging from 6 to 16 months), given the fact that the
serious Implementation problems did *eist. It appears that supervision
missions somehow failed to fully appre#;Iate Implementation problems which
later on developed into serioug issues.



-9-
8.04     Lessons Learned
(1)   Supervision missions should be fielded at regular and shorter
intervals so that Project implementation issues could be addressed
in a more timely manner.
(ii) Tighter monltoring of disbursements.
(iII) Since technical assistance ws critical to Implementation of the
Project, the Association should have made the hiring of
consultants a condition for credit effectiveness and subsequeatly
made provision for retroactive financing of the process.
(iv)  The use of Bank's 1985 Sample Bidding Document (SBD), will reduce
the likelihood of bidding documents causing disagreements over the
interpretation of Important clauses.
9.       Borrower's Performance
9.01     The Project suffered from delays due to lack of speedy decision-
making on the part of the Borrower. For instance, from the dato of receipt
of bids, It took 11 months to evaluate the bids and award the contract.
Problems relating to the construction of houses for the consultant team
were primarily due to the failure of SR1CTR to respond to the first
contractor within a reasonable period of tim.
9.02     The Project also suffered from the instability in the management
of the SRMCTR Frequoet changes in the department's staff made it diffleult
to ensure a coherent implementation strategy.
9.03     The reorganization of the Southern Region into three regions and
civil unrest In the Southern Regions complicated Project implementation,
though this was largely outsid- the Borrower control.
9.04     The supervision and implementation of the Project have been
hindered by the comunication problem  between the North and the South. The
supervision team could not go to Juba until the fifth supervision mission
in July 1981 and managed to meet with SRMCTR officials for the first tim
in Nairobi during the fourth mission.
10.      Consultants' Performance
10.01    The design of the road wa carried out satisfactorily by the
consultant. The design of the ferries was not satisfactory in terms of
type and dimension. A new design had to be prepared in the next project.
Construction supervision has been satisfactory to the extent that the worka
were carried out in accordance with the speclfications. However, the
consultants performed poorly regarding preparation of progress repkirts
which failed to describe satisfactorily major problems and issues,
particularly their effect on construction costs.



- 10 -
10.02    The consultents in charge of the technical assistance to the
Southern Region, had not been up to standards in the first stages of their
activitios: They did not field the team as quickly as promised and inotead
of working with the minitry, adopted an audLting attLtuds. The
portormance of the con ultants, however, improved signifLeantly throughout
the Project. The consultants managed to complete the revised technical
assistance component. The consultant's work was made diffieult because of
the lack of housing, conmunication problem betw en Juba and the rest of
the country, diffLeulties in obtaining resources from the Regional
Governmnt, unsatisfactory security conditLons ln and around Juba and
dLvision of the Southern Region into three.
10.03    The consultants who carried out the road studies have done so in a
t$iuly and satisfactory manner.
