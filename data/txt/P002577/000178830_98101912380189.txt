STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Structure on Transport
1.01      Sudan, the largest country on the African continent, is essentially
an enormous plain, with a large uninhabited desert in the northern third of
the country and tropical forests and savannas in the south. It is traversed
from north to south by the Nile River system (see Map IBRD 13332R), close to
which lives a large part of the country's 16.5 million population, which is
growing at a rate of 3% p.a. Per capita GNP is US$300.
1.02      Agriculture dominates the economy, accounting for over 40% of GDP
and almost all export earnings. Economic activity is largely concentrated
within the fertile and well-irrigated 400 km stretch south and east of
Khartoum. More than half the population depends for its livelihood directly
on agriculture, and a substantial amount of farm production is exported
through Port Sudan, the only deep-water port. The lack of all-weather con-
nections between areas of production and consumption (mainly Khartoum), and
the point of export and import (Port Sudan) is a major obstacle to achieving
the full development potential in this sector.
1.03      Provision of inexpensive, efficient and reliable surface transport
is particularly difficult in view of Sudan's harsh climate, the long distances
involved, and the lack of suitable construction materials in many areas. The
Nile contributes very little relative to its apparent potential: in the north
it is repeatedly interrupted by unnavigable rapids, while in the south the
White Nile meanders through the Sudd, a vast swamp with continually shifting
channels. The sparse rail and road systems, which must cross hot, arid
deserts in the north, northeast and central zones and skirt the Sudd in the
south, are oriented for exports through Port Sudan.
B. The Transport System
1.04      Sudan's transport network is grossly inadequate.  Although the rail-
way system of 4,800 km is quite extensive, and is the principal means of
transporting foreign trade to and from Port Sudan, it fails to meet the demands
placed upon it. Of the almost 16,000 km of roads, only about 1,500 km are
paved, mostly in the Khartoum-Port Sudan corridor; the 3,000 km of gravel
roads are mostly located in the six southern provinces where laterite material
is available. Much of the road network, particularly in the more populated
and developed areas, passes over heavy clay soils which are generally im-
passable during the rainy season (June-October). However, an extensive road
construction program is underway (Table 2.2) and the volume of road transport



- 2 -
is increasing rapidly. River transport is the major surface link to the
south, but operational difficulties constrain its efficiency and reliability.
Air transport is constrained because: most of Sudan's 20 airports are
subject to closure during seasonal rains due to soft runways; only Khartoum,
Port Sudan and Juba have night landing facilities; and air traffic control
and navigational communications are very limited.
Road Transot
1.05      Road transport is discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.06      The main traffic route of Sudan Railways Corporation (SRC) is between
Port Sudan, Atbara and Khartoum (787 km), which carries 60% of all SRC freight.
However, with Government's planned expansion of the agricultural sector (para.
1.19), the alternative route -- Port Sudan, Haiya, Kassala, Sennar, Khartoum
-- will become increasingly important in the future for the transport of
agricultural production from the south and west. It is expected that freight
traffic on this route will reach 2.8 billion ton-km, or 43% of SRC's total,
by 1982/83. There are branch lines north to Karima and Wadi Halfa, west
to Nyala, and south to Wau and Damazin (see Map IBRD 13332R).
1.07      The principal role of the Railways is to transport agricultural
products to Port Sudan for export, and to move imports, increasingly capital
goods and construction materials, from Port Sudan to Khartoum and other parts
of the country. SRC's role in internal freight movements has been relatively
minor, accounting for 13% of all freight traffic in 1976, but is expected to
increase over the next few years as local production of sugar, foodgrains
and textiles builds up. From 1971 to 1975, SRC failed to meet the freight
traffic demand, resulting in accumulation of imports at Port Sudan and prob-
ably loss of exports from the interior, This was attributable to frequent
mechanical failures arising from inadequate maintenance of diesel locomotives
whose design was also not well adapted to Sudan's climatic conditions.  The
position improved in 1976 following the introduction of 50 new diesel loco-
motives, and total freight carried in 1976 was 20% above the 1975 level.
However, tonnage carried declined by 6% in 1977 due to a decrease in loco-
motive availability, caused partly by a shortage of spare parts.
1,08      SRC freight traffic is expected to increase from 2.7 million tons
in 1976 to over 5 million tons by 1983, 1/ even recognizing that a growing
proportion of high-value, low-volume traffic will increasingly use highway
transport, especially on the Port Sudan-Khartoum route (para. 1.24), and that
almost all white oil traffic will be lost to the recently opened pipeline on
this route. To meet the forecast traffic, SRC will need to undertake exten-
sive track improvement, improve its maintenance of track, locomotives and
rolling stock, and improve its training of middle-level managers and tech-
nical staff. These requirements are being addressed under the Bank's Third
and Fourth Railway Projects (Annex 1) and with bilateral assistance.
1/   See IBRD Report No. 1459a-SU Sudan, Fourth Railway Project, June 6, 1977,
Annex 7.



3-
1.09      SRC's financial performance has paralleled the trends in operating
efficiency and traffic. There was a steady decline in profitability from an
operating profit of fSd 1.6 million in 1971 to a loss of ISd 3.1 million in
1975.  However, a 20% tariff increase in mid-1975, and the traffic increase in
1976 led to a 34% increase in revenues in 1976, when for the first time since
1972 operating revenues covered all expenses, including depreciation and
interest. The situation deteriorated in 1977 when earnings failed to cover
interest charges, but a tariff increase of about 25% effective from January
1978 is expected to rectify this shortfall.
1.10      SRC computes costs by classes of commodities and its tariff structure
generally is based on costs which are regularly updated.
Ports and Inland Waterways
1.11      Existing facilities at Port Sudan are approaching maximum utiliza-
tion.  In addition, cargo handling is very inefficient and needs to be im-
proved by the introduction of more mechanized cargo handling equipment (fork-
lifts, tractors, mobile cranes), and the use of more bulk and unitized cargo
handling facilities. The Port is administered by the Sea Ports Corporation,
which comes under the Ministry of Transport; it requires considerable
strengthening, especially in port management, personnel and training, and
planning.
1.12      To handle the anticipated growth in foreign trade, Government plans
to expand and improve Port Sudan in the immediate future, and in the medium
term to develop a new port in the vicinity of Suakin, some 40 km south of Port
Sudan. Some mechanized cargo handling equipment was provided for Port Sudan
under the Third Railway Project. The recently approved Port Project aims to
increase Port Sudan's physical capacity, operational productivity and manage-
ment efficiency through civil works, and the provision of equipment, training
and technical assistance.
1.13      The Sea Ports Corporation's financial position is satisfactory
despite the operational deficiencies at Port Sudan because it has few capi-
tal investments to amortize and traffic volume is substantial. During 1977,
the Corporation had revenues of hSd 9 million, operating expenditures of
ESd 4 million and, after providing for depreciation and interest, a net
operating surplus of over ESd 4 million.
1.14      River transport is used on the Kosti-Malakal-Juba (1,450 km) and
the Karima-Dongola (290 km) sections of the Nile system. The Kosti-Juba
section is by far the most important, accounting for 70% of river traffic
and serving as the major surface transport link between southern and central
Sudan. Even so, it falls a long way short of meeting the south's freight
transport requirements, handling only 80,000 tons per year, 90% of which
flows from north to south. Use of river transport is constrained by physi-
cal conditions, such as shallow water especially during the 3-4 low-water



-4                           /
months, a huge swamp in the south, and water hyacinth encroachment; by inade-
quate berthing and cargo handling facilities; and by the inefficient services
of the River Transport Corporation (RTC), which generally has a waiting time
of about six months for shipments other than oil products and food, which
receive priority. Low fleet utilization, attributable to poor maintenance, is
compounded by low load factors which are largely the result of the directional
imbalance of traffic and the necessity to underload on shallow river sections.
RTC has had a monopoly of river transport services, but the Southern Region 1/
recently established a feeder river transport service, and there is a small
but growing volume of private river transport.
1.15      Sudan and Egypt have agreed to jointly finance construction of a 280
km canal in a direct line from Jonglei to just south of Malakal; the canal, on
which work started early in 1978, should improve prospects for river transport
in the south. RTC's fleet is being expanded with assistance from IDA (under
the Third Railway Project) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The
principal outstanding task is to improve berthing and cargo handling facil-
ities and to strengthen RTC's management, fleet maintenance, channel mainte-
nance/improvement, staff training and supervision.
Civil Aviation
1.16      Of Sudan's 20 airports, only Khartoum is genuinely all-weather.
Khartoum is also the only airport with electronic landing aids, which are
being upgraded with new equipment provided under a loan from the United
Kingdom. Air traffic control and navigational communications within Sudan
are limited, and much of the existing equipment is obsolete. Under the IDA
Domestic A-viation Project, two new regional airports are being constructed
at Port Sudan and Wau, and Juba and Malakal airports are being upgraded to
accommodate modern jet aircraft. Communication and navigational equipment
for the four airports will also be provided under the Aviation Project.
1.17      Sudan's airports are the responsibility of the Civil Aviation
Department which, although part of the Ministry of Defence and partly manned
by military personnel, functions as a civilian government department. To
upgrade its small outlying airports, the Department has recently oroanized
an Airports Engineering Design and Construction Unit. For large projects
consultants and contractors are to be engaged, but their work will be super-
vised by this new Unit. To date, the Unit has completed the reconstruction
of Atbara, Kassala and Dongola airports and is now working on Halfa airport,
with equipment provided by a loan from the FRG. Technical assistance to
strengthen this Unit is being provided under the IDA Domestic Aviation
Project and by UNDP.
1.18      Air traffic in Sudan has grown relatively rapidly over the past
four years despite seriously constrained domestic services. The number
1/   The Southern Region comprises the provinces of Bahr El Ghazal,
El Buheyrat, Eastern and Western Equatoria, Junglei and Upper Nile
(see Map - IBRD 13332R).



of domestic air passengers has more than doubled since 1969, the principal
routes being between Khartoum and Port Sudan, Malakal, El Obeid and Juba.
Sudan Airways Corporation services all 20 domestic airports, with Khartoum
as the hub, and also provides international services to neighboring African
countries, the Middle East and Europe. The Corporation's financial results
have improvEd significantly in recent years to the point where operating
revenues approximately cover operating expenditures.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.19      Government's development strategy centers around Sudan's great
potential for agricultural expansion. Economic growth in the near future
is expected to come principally from the agricultural sector, with increasing
volumes of agricultural products exported abroad to pay for rising imports of
consumer and capital goods. In support of this, the Government's Six-Year
Development Plan (1977/78-1982/83) identifies the following objectives for the
transport sector:
(a) to attain a higher level of utilization of existing
facilities by promoting operating efficiency;
(b) to provide increased capacity in existing traffic
corridors where required, partly by promoting
competition between modes; and
(c) to spread the transport network wider to encourage
dispersal of economic activity to less developed
areas, and to achieve a more equitable and balanced
pattern of economic and social growth.
1.20      In recognition of the magnitude of these undertakings, important
analyses of the investment needs of the sector have recently been carried
out by the Associates for the Development of Arab Resources (ADAR) with
Kuwait Fund financing (Annex 4, No. 1) and by a Comprehensive Employment
Survey Mission sent by the International Labor Organization (ILO) (Annex 4,
No. 14). Moreover, in the last three years the Government has substantially
increased its investment expenditures in this sector as the spearhead of its
national development efforts:

1.21      Government is continuing to accord a high priority to transport
investment. The approved Six-Year Plan calls for about ESd 462 million in-
vestment over 1977/78-82/83, comprising a LSd 282 million public sector
investment (about 18% of total planned public sector investments) and a
ESd 180 million private sector investment, distributed between the modes
as follows:

Public sector roads expenditure is likely to approximate the Plan figures
since almost all projects included in the Plan are funded, and finance has
already been arranged for some projects not included in the Plan (Table 2.2).
1.22      In addition to the substantial investments required to achieve
the two-fold objective of meeting transport needs and economic integration,
the operational problems which prevent some of the modes from providing
reliable, efficient services must be overcome through well-conceived, concen-
trated and sustained long-term efforts. Substantial improvements, it must
be recognized, will not be achieved easily or quickly. The same is true
of deficiencies in qualified professional staff, adequately trained and
supervised sub-professional staff and poor maintenance, shortcomings shared
by most of the transport organizations.
1.23      Sudan's 1971-75 Development Plan (subsequently extended to 1977)
was not formulated on the basis of economic priorities but consisted largely
of a list of proposals by the various ministries to meet specific require-
ments, Since the drafting of that Plan in 1970, the planning system has
been considerably improved with the assistance of a UNDP-financed planning
team in the Ministry of National Planning (MNP), which is responsible for
intersectoral planning, and through the training efforts of the Bank Group's
Economic Development Institute (EDI) which has conducted a number of courses
in Khartoum tailored to Sudan's needs. MNP also has a well-staffed Transport
Section, responsible for ensuring that transport projects are compatible with
other sectors. To provide a basis for the transport sector investment plan,
the Section prepared a Freight Traffic Estimation Study projecting traffic for
each mode over the 1978-83 Plan period, based on past traffic trends and
physical targets for output growth in the productive sectors. The new Develop-
ment Plan thus takes a balanced view of transport sector requirements in
relation to those of other sectors. Paucity of data, principally on truck
transport, has hindered planning efforts, but the Transport Section has made
an effective start in filling this gap with several recent studies (Annex 4,
Nos. 7, 10 and 11).
1.24      Investment plans within each mode are formulated by planning units
in the modal departments or corporations, which to varying degrees suffer from
shortages of qualified staff. Until recently, modal coordination, which
is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport, had not been an issue
because most transport services were complementary. This will not be the
case much longer since the Government is now following a policy which will
encourage rail/road competition. For instance, roads which will offer
an alternative to the railway are being constructed (Khartoum-Port Sudan,
Wad Medani-Sennar-Kosti, and Sennar-Roseires), and import duties on trucks
have been reduced to promote a much needed expansion of road transport.
Thus coordination of transport planning, investments and operations is assum-
ing importance and will require more careful consideration in the future.
The Six-Year Plan for the Transport and Communications Sector has addressed
the key issues by defining the appropriate roles for each mode in general



- 8 -
terms. For example, the railways are expected to concentrate primarily on
longer-haul freight traffic, while road transport will be encouraged to feed
the rail system and, in cases where it directly competes with rail transport,
to concentrate on passenger and shorter-haul freight traffic, for which it is
better suited. According to the Plan there will be a minimum of restrictions
on modal competition and much greater emphasis on using pricing to allocate
traffic among competing modes. This will require the Ministry of Transport to
ensure that tariff systems are such that traffic on each mode is bearing all
the costs attributed to it. The UNDP and the Netherlands Government are
financing technical assistance and training to help the Ministry of Transport
exercise this and other functions.
D. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.25      The Bank Group is assisting in the development of all modern trans-
port modes in Sudan, except pipelines, as well as in overall transport plan-
ning. Involvement in the sector began with the 1958 First Railway Project
(Loan 202-SU, US$39 million), which assisted the Government in a program
to modernize and extend rail, river and port facilities. After successful
completion of the project in 1964, a Second Railway Project (Loan 440-SU,
US$31 million) was approved in 1965 to finance further rail, river and port
investments; this project was satisfactorily completed in 1972. Sector-wide
needs were assessed by a Bank Group economic mission in 1971, followed by
the First Highway Project (Credit 331-SU, US$7 million), in 1972. A 1972
economic mission further explored transport requirements and, in 1974, the
Third Railway Project (Credit 457-SU, US$24 million) financed investments
and technical assistance for rail, river and port development and airport
preinvestment studies. Also, the Bank Group was the executing agency for a
UNDP-financed Railways Operational Techni al Assistance Project carried out
by a team from the Australian National Railways in 1973-74. In 1975, the
Bank Group took part in an ILO Comprehensive Employment Survey mission in
Sudan through the participation of six staff members, including a transport
economist. Two projects approved in 1976 (Credit 614-SU, US$4 million; and
Loan 1287-SU and Credit 643-SU, US$20 million and US$9 million, respectively)
provide technical assistance for preinvestment work, some of which is in the
transport sector, and assistance in developing four domestic airports. In
1977, the Board approved a Fourth Railway Project (Credit 727-SU, US$8 million
and Loan 1467 T-SU, US$12 million) and, in March 1978, a Port Project
(Credit 781-SU, US$20 million) was approved to improve Port Sudan. Further
details on Bank Group-financed projects in the sector,are given in Annex 1.
In addition, the Mechanized Farming, Rahad and Southern Region Rehabilitation
Projects include road construction components, and the Livestock Marketing
Project includes rail and road transport equipment. Finally, EDI has offered
transport planning courses in Sudan on four occasions, one as recently as
February of 1978, which have been attended by a total of about 100 Sudanese.



1.26      The First Highway Project provided for technical assistance in
transport planning; strengthening the organization and operations of the
two road authorities in Sudan, the Roads and Bridges Public Corporation
(RBPC) and the Southern Regional Ministry of Communications, Transport and
Roads through consulting services, technical assistance, equipment and spares;
and feasibility studies of about 660 km of roads and subsequent engineering of
about 550 km. A project component for assistance in sectoral planning was
deleted when UNDP agreed to finance such experts for MNP and the Ministry of
Transport (paras. 1.23-.24). The consultants Louis Berger International Inc.
(US) carried out a comprehensive study (henceforth referred to as the Berger
Study) of the highway subsector identifying construction and maintenance
priorities, and containing recommendations for the organization and operation
of RBPC (Annex 4, Nos. 3 and 4). The Study has provided the basis for much
that has followed, including the reorganization of RBPC, procurement of equip-
ment and spares, technical assistance, and feasibility studies of priority
roads identified in the Study. The consultants BCEOM (France) carried out
feasibility studies of three roads, including the road proposed for con-
struction under this project (Annex 4, No. 2).
1.27      There have been three problems under the First Highway Project.
First, equipment and feasibility studies cost more than expected, requiring
some reduction in project scope, principally by the deletion of detailed
engineering. Second, recruitment of technical assistance was slow and, in
the south., technical assistance could not be retained due to poor living
conditions. Third, equipment for the south was slow to arrive and when it did
arrive utilization was low due to lack of fuel, spares and workshops. In the
proposed project, no repetition of the rapid cost increases of 1974-75 is
expected, and it is hoped to overcome the difficulties in the south by offering
more attractive conditions for technical assistance and addressing the factors
responsible for slow delivery and poor utilization of equipment.
1.28      In other transport projects, implementation has also been qualita-
tively satisfactory in general, although there have been delays attributable
to complicated procurement procedures, and cost increases have required a
reduction in project scope. A Project Performance Audit Report on the Second
Railway Project, issued in 1974, commented on implementation delays and on
the shortfalls in traffic, operating efficiency, financial targets and eco-
nomic benefits. The causes of these delays and shortfalls, which do not
apply in the highway subsector, have been addressed in the Third and Fourth
Railway Projects and the Port Project.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The road system of Sudan is minimal.  With a total road length
of about 16,000 km (excluding town roads), road density is only 7 km per



- 10 -
1,000 km  or 1 km per 1,000 persons, the lowest in Eastern Africa.  Moreover,
as indicated in Table 2.1, there are only about 1,500 km of bitumen paved roads
outside the towns, and most of the unpaved roads are essentially tracks,
passable only by trucks or four-wheel drive vehicles. The tracks in the clay
plains, which cover most of the country's eastern half, are closed completely
for an average of three to four months during the wet season; this is espe-
cially significant since most of the present and near-term future economic
activity is in this area.

2.02      Traditionally, Sudan has relied on rail to transport the bulk
of its foreign trade, with road transport feeding the railheads. However,
the railway has not kept up with the increasing demands, and this has caused
losses of agricultural production and foreign exchange earnings because
of late delivery of inputs, spoilage of output, and failure to meet contract
dates. The inadequacy of the railway is reflected in the fact that in spite
of extremely difficult conditions and high costs, increasing volumes of
goods (and passengers) are being transported by road. For example, a 1975
traffic count measured 890 vehircles per day (virtually all trucks and buses)
on the direct track between Khartoum and Kassala. Consequently, although some
improvement in the railways' efficiency can be expected as a result of Bank-
financed projects (para. 1.08), in recent years Government has sought to
develop a road alternative by carrying out an extensive program of works on
the Wad Medani-Gedaref-Kassala-Haiya-Port Sudan and Wad Medani-Sennar-Kosti
routes. In addition, work is about to commence on construction of a 290 km
bitumen paved road from Sennar to Damazin, with Arab-Kuwait Fund financing,
and on the 205 km Nyala-Zalingei road with the FRG, Saudi Fund and Islamic
Fund assistance. When these works, and the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road pro-
posed under this project (para. 3.03), are completed by the early 1980s, the
bitumen paved network will stand at almost 3,000 km, compared with about 1,500
km now and less than 400 km in 1973.

2.03      Most of the 3,000 km of existing gravel roads are in the south, and
are badly in need of rehabilitation following two decades of neglect during
and after the Civil War. As indicated in Table 2.2, about 1,600 km of
these roads are presently being rehabilitated with assistance from Canada, the
Netherlands, Norway, FRG, IDA and UNDP. The proposed project will provide
further assistance for rehabilitation work, as well as assistance in develop-
ing an institutional capacity to maintain the rehabilitated roads.
2.04      With financing under a joint IDA-Kuwait Fund Technical Assistance
Project, a Feeder Roads Study has recently commenced which will identify
priorities for provision of feeder roads.
B. Road Usage
Vehicle Fleet
2.05      The vehicle fleet has almost doubled between 1970 and 1975 (Table
2.3). The growth in commercial vehicles has been particularly rapid since
1974 when the Government reduced import duties on these vehicles to encour-
age development of the trucking industry.

2.06       Despite the rapid growth in the fleet, average vehicle density is
very low at 6 vehicles per 1,000 persons. Moreover, actual vehicle density
for most of the country is much lower because over half of the fleet is li-
censed in Khartoum Province. The Southern Region, for example, accounts for
20% of Sudan's population but less than 4% of the vehicle fleet.
Traffic
2.07       Under the IDA-financed First Highway Project, the Government is
just beginning to collect traffic data systematically on paved roads and roads
planned for construction. A program of traffic surveys has been prepared and
mechanical counters have been procured. The best existing source of traffic
data is the counts carried out under the 1974 Berger Study also financed under
the First Highway Project. Counts were made at 101 separate and strategic
locations covering almost 11,000 km of roads, and indicated that, despite
the rudimentary state of the road network, there were relatively high flows
of over 200 vehicles per day (vpd) on over half the road length surveyed,
and flows of over 100 vpd on 85% of the length surveyed. Trucks dominate,
frequently accounting for up to 90% of total traffic on non-urban roads.
2.08       Because of the dearth of data, it is difficult to generalize about
traffic growth over time. However, several counts have been taken on the
Khartoum-Wad Medani road (186 km), which was completed to bituminous paved
standard in the late 1960s, and they give an indication of the rapid traffic
growth that can occur in such circumstances:

More generally, MNP estimates that between 1969/70 and 1974/75 the volume
of road freight almost tripled to 2.6 billion ton-km and road passenger
travel increased 70% to 5.84 billion passenger-km. MNP expects both road
freight and passenger traffic to approximately double between 1974/75 and
1982/83.
Trucking Industry
2.09       Trucking operations are largely concentrated in an area bounded
by Khartoum, Kosti, Damazin and Port Sudan. Other important operations
occur between Kosti and Malakal, around El Obeid, and between the Southern
Regional capital of Juba and the southern rail terminal of Wau. The industry



- 15 -
is competitive, being dominated by owner-drivers, with freight rates deter-
mined by market forces. The typical vehicle is a 6-ton Bedford with a
locally constructed body, although larger trucks and truck-trailer combina-
tions are becoming more common. A parastatal trucking company, the Sudan-
Kuwaiti Transport Company, commenced operations in October 1975. Its fleet
consists of 100 trucks with trailers, and it mainly operates on the Khartoum-
Port Sudan route. Financial results to date have been satisfactory, with
operating revenues covering operating costs, depreciation and interest.
Regulations
2.10      Vehicle safety and traffic regulations are satisfactory, but axle-
load limits (9 tons on bridges and bitumen-surfaced roads) have rarely been
enforced in the past. Under the First Highway Project, Government agreed to
take adequate enforcement measures and the Ministry of Overseas Development
(ODM, UK) financed an axle load survey in July 1977 by the Transport and
Road Research Laboratory (TRRL). The survey, carried out on six key roads,
revealed that 12-40% of trucks (varying from road to road) had excessive
axle loads. As part of the TRRL study, ODM provided three mobile weigh-
bridges and is presently considering an RBPC request to finance six permanent
weighbridges of a type recommended by TRRL, to be installed at priority sites
identified by the axle load survey. The proposed project provides for an
additional permanent weighbridge, to be installed on the project road (para.
3.03). An enforcement program is presently being prepared and patrol forces
are being formed, in accordance with the covenant under the First Highway
Project. IDA supervision missions will continue to monitor progress with
enforcement.
C. Administration
2.11      Responsibility for highway construction and maintenance is divided
among the Central Government's RBPC, the Southern Regional Ministry of Com-
munications, Transport and Roads (SRMCTR) and the provincial authorities.
RBPC is nominally responsible for the national road network throughout the
country (presently 11,000 km), but actually only administers bituminous paved
roads and, in the Southern Region, becomes involved only in major projects,
such as the present joint RBPC-SRMCTR study of an upgraded road link to Kenya.
Otherwise SRMCTR is effectively responsible for national roads in the Southern
Region. All non-national roads are in theory the responsibility of the
provincial authorities but, because their road planning, construction and
maintenance capacity is very limited, RBPC maintains the bituminous paved
portions of this network and SRMCTR assists Southern Regional provinces with
the rehabilitation of their gravel roads. There is thus a need to develop an
institutional capacity at the provincial level, although the first priority is
to strengthen RBPC and SRMCTR so that they are capable of meeting their own
obligations, and of gradually expanding their assistance with priority require-
ments for non-national roads as trained staff becomes available. For the
immediate future, however, it appears that the most appropriate way of meeting



- 16 -
non-national roads requirements for agricuitural projects will continue to be
by providing road units within the projects, as is happening under the IDA-
assisted Southern Region Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Credit 476-SU)
and the Mechanized Farming Projects (Ln.556 and Cr.331-SU).
2.12      RBPC is a parastatal organization created in 1973 out of the former
Department of Roads and reorganized in 1975 a:long the lines recommended in the
Berger Study. It is supervised by a Board of Directors which reports to the
M.inister for Transport. The Board consists of a full-time Chairman, the
Director General of RBPC, representatives from the Minister's Office, the
Ministries of Transport and National Planning, plus three other members
appointed by the Minister, including one from the private sector. Under the
Director General, RBPC consists of four divisions (see Chart 1): the Projects
Division responsible for design, laboratories, and contract supervision;
the Operations Division responsible for force account construction, maintenance
and the mechanical engineering section; an Administration and Finance Division;
and a Planning Division which will become operational with assistance under
the Arab-Kuwait Fund project (para. 2.02). Until recently, all RBPC staff
were based in Khartoum but district offices are now being established in
several places, in accordance with the Berger Study recommendations.
2.13      SRMCTR reports to the Southern Regional Minister for Communications,
Transport and Roads. It is responsible for all transport modes in the Region,
but is an extremely weak organization, with only seven roads engineers in
its Roads Department (Chart 2). There have been no major road construction
projects in the Region for many years. All ongoing and most proposed projects
are rehabilitation work (Table 2.2). generally by units professionally staffed
by bilateral agencies or by expatriates financed by UNDP or IDA. Reflecting
the new emphasis on roads, SRMCTR intends to strengthen its Roads Department,
with assistance under the proposed project (para. 3.07).
D. Planning
2.14      Although both RBPC and SRMCTR lack planning capacity, the road con-
struction projects included in the Six-Year Plan (Table 2.2) have a highly
satisfactory study base which includes the Sudan Transport Study, financed by
the Kuwait Fund, the Berger Study financed under IDA's First Highway Project,
and the Freight Traffic Estimation Study and Origin-Destination Study, both
carried out by MNP's recently established Transport Planning Unit. Further-
more, all major projects are preceded by individual feasibility studies.
Three priority roads totalling 664 km identified in the Berger Study were the
subject of feasibility studies under the First Highway Project: the Jebel
Aulia-Ed Dueim section (158 km) of one of these roads (Jebel Aulia-Rabak, 267
km) is included in the proposed project, with the Ed Dueim-Rabak section
expected to be financed by the Arab Fund; construction of another road,
Sennar-Damazin (290 km) is about to commence under the Arab-Kuwait Fund
project (para. 2.02); and construction of the third road, El Obeid-Dubeibat
(107 km), to bituminous-paved standard was found to be infeasible before 1982,



- 17 -
although the Dutch Government has recently agreed to undertake a first stage
improvement to gravel standard. Feasibility studies of other roads identified
in the Berger Study have been completed with assistance from a number of
bilateral agencies.
2.15      The Arab-Kuwait Fund project includes assistance for establishing
RBPC's Planning Division (para. 2.12). In SRMCTR, virtually the only plan-
ning activity consists of coordinating the efforts of agencies supporting
rehabilitation units. The institutional assistance for SRMCTR included in the
proposed project will include technical assistance for planning (para. 3.07).
E. Financing
2.16      Highway expenditures are financed from general revenues and foreign
aid, the latter accounting for almost all major construction. Road construc-
tion expenditures by RBPC have increased dramatically in recent years, from
iSd 0.4 million (US$0.8 million) in 1971/72 to almost 1Sd 37 million (US$74
million) in 1977/78 (Table 2.5). The Six-Year Plan calls for expenditures
totalling bSd 125 million (US$250 million), of which approximately hSd 66 mil-
lion (US$132 million) would be for completion of ongoing projects and bSd 59
million (US$118 million) would be for new projects. As noted in para. 1.21,
this latter figure is likely to be attained.
2.17      Administrative expenses of RBPC have reflected the general expan-
sion of road activities, rising from about bSd 160,000 in 1971/72 to hSd
850,000 in 1977/78. Even so, actual expenditures on administration con-
sistently fall well short of budget allocations, reflecting RBPC's inability
to fill vacancies and the loss of professional staff to the Arab oil states.
Maintenance expenditures grew slowly between 1971/72 and 1976/77. Although
they more than doubled between 1976/77 and 1977/78, the level of expenditure
is still inadequate, and further substantial increases will be required over
the next five years (para. 2.26).

/1   The maintenance allocation in this year included funds for works on the
Dilling-Kadugli road and sections of the Khartoum-Wad Medani road.
However, the works were subsequently classified as rehabilitation and
therefore financed from the Development Budget,
Source: RBPC, 1978.
2.18      The Central Government's Six-Year Plan and annual counterpart,
the Development Budget, nominally covers expenditures for the whole country,
but the Six-Year Plan makes negligible provision for road projects in the
south. The Southern Regional Government is empowered to prepare a supplemental
Special Development Budget for the Region but this is of limited scope,
totalling only bSd 3.0 million for roads in 1977/78, excluding external finance
of about eSd 1.0 million for rehabilitation projects being carried out in the
Region (Table 2.2). The Region's recurrent budget provides only ESd 70,000
for non-wage expenditure on maintenance in 1977/78; this figure will have to
be increased substantially over the next 5 years (para. 2.28), and an assurance
to this effect was received from Government.
2.19      The Central Government levies import duties on vehicles, parts and
crude oil, an annual flat rate "business profits tax" on public carriers,
and an excise duty on fuel and lubricants. The first two types of tax,
which produce revenue of over ESd 20 million (US$40 million) per year may be



- 19 -
regarded as of a general nature rather than as specific to road users. 1/
However, the excise on petroleum products is a specific tax. Road users pay
over bSd 10 million (US$20 million) by way of this tax, well in excess of
present recurrent highway expenditures by both RBPC and SRMCTR and the level
that such expenditures should reach by 1982/83 (paras. 2.26, 2.28). In
addition, provincial authorities collect over 1Sd 3 million (US$6 million)
annually in vehicle and drivers license fees, associated taxes and road tolls.
The Transport Planning Unit in the MNP is about to complete a study on
the appropriate level and structure of road-user taxation. In view of the
importance of proper road pricing for ensuring effective intermodal competi-
tion (para. 1.24), Government agreed to complete by June 30, 1979 the study on
road user taxes, and to exchange views with the Association on plans to
implement the recommendations resulting from the study (para. 5.01 (a)).
F. Engineering
2.20      With only half of its 82 civil engineering posts filled, RBPC has
not been able to staff a separate design division.   Engineering for most
major road projects is therefore carried out by foreign consultants making
use of RBPC's now well-equipped materials and soils laboratory, re-equipped
under IDA's First Highway Project. RBPC's engineers are, however, engaged
in preliminary investigations and minor road and bridge design, and the
Arab-Kuwait Fund project provides for technical assistance and procurement
to establish and equip a design division. Comprehensive design standards
have as yet not been formally adopted, but appropriate standards for high
volume trunk roads, suggested by the Berger Study (Annex 4, No. 3), have
been used for recent projects with some amendments. RBPC is at present
considering an IDA proposal for comprehensive design standards, incorporat-
ing different road classes for different traffic volumes and differentiating
between flat, rolling and mountainous terrain. Agreement was reached that no
later than December 31, 1979 Government would adopt adequate geometric design
standards satisfactory to the Association for road construction and would
cause RBPC to comply with such standards (para. 5.01 (b)).
2.21      In the Southern Region, very little formal engineering is carried
out by SRMCTR. Roads being rehabilitated are engineered in the field to
minimum standards. These standards, which mainly relate to drainage and
roadway width, are adequate for present traffic conditions in the Region.
However, for the Region's future road requirements, it would be desirable for
SRMCTR to adopt the same comprehensive design standards as RBPC, and agreement
to this effect was reached with Government (para. 5.01 (b)); the technical
assistance team financed under the project will assist SRMCTR in this respect
as well as in establishing planning and design capacities.
1/   With the exception of cars, on which a high import duty of 100-150% of
CIF value is levied, the import duties applied to other transport equip-
ment and fuel fall within the 30-50% range, which applies to most other
imports.



- 20 -
G. Construction
2.22      For major road projects, RBPC employs foreign contractors, following
suitable prequalification procedures; contracts are generally let on a unit
price basis. In recent years, RBPC has undertaken several force account road
construction projects (about US$5.0 million equivalent annually), in some
instances with the assistance of foreign technical supervisory/advisory teams.
Performance under these projects appears satisfactory. Supervision of con-
struction contracts is carried out by consulting engineers supported by RBPC
staff; supervision of force account work is carried out by RBPC staff, in some
instances reinforced by foreign technical assistants. Supervision is satis-
factory.
2.23      SRMCTR's efforts are mostly directed towards rehabilitation of the
old gravel roads in the Region. The rehabilitation is largely financed by bi-
lateral aid (about US$2.0 million annually) and carried out by separate units
satisfactorily administered and supervised by technical assistants provided by
the bilateral agencies. Under the First Highway Project, IDA sought to
develop SRMCTR's own capacity to undertake and supervise rehabilitation work.
However, implementation has been hampered by slow delivery and low utilization
of equipment (the latter due to lack of fuel, spares and workshop facilities)
and the inability to retain an expatriate supervisor primarily due to the
absence of suitable accommodations. The proposed project addresses these
problems (para. 3.07).
2.24      At present, construction and rehabilitation work is done mainly
by fairly equipment-intensive methods. In the north this is because all
present construction work consists of high standard bituminous-paved roads
for which equipment-intensive methods are most appropriate. In the south,
some rehabilitation work is carried out by labor-intensive methods. but there
is an extreme shortage of qualified foremen and supervisors, and attempts
during 1977 by one of the bilaterally financed units to adopt labor-intensive
methods foundered for this reason together with difficulty in recruiting
labor. As noted in para. 2.04, work is in progress on a study which will
identify feeder road priorities; subsequent detailed engineering of these
roads (some of whichl may be financed by the proposed project) will address
the question of appropriate technology, which differs from one part of Sudan
to another, depending on terrain, labor availability, and logistical consider-
ations.
2.25      The local contracting industry is mostly engaged in construction
of buildings and small structures. It does not have the capacity to under-
take major construction projects and, apart from occasional haulage of
materials for RBPC projects, has not been employed on road construction.
The efficiency and capacity of the industry is being addressed in three ways.
The European Economic Community (EEC) is financing a study of building tech-
niques and utilization of local materials that will be followed by programs to
improve efficiency and introduce new techniques. The Management Development
and Productivity Center, in cooperation with the Institute of Public Adminis-
tration and with UNDP/ILO assistance, is offering useful management training.



- 21 -
Finally, Sudan is included in a UNDP study to be executed by the Bank in
1979/80, of how best to improve and expand the contracting industry in
selected developing countries.
H. Maintenance
2.26      RBPC is responsible for maintaining all paved non-urban roads
regardless of classification; maintenance of national roads in the Southern
Region is the responsibility of the SRMCTR while the provincial authorities
are responsible for maintaining all other roads. RBPC's maintenance opera-
tions are carried out by force account and are largely mechanized. Until
recently, operations were hampered by insufficient equipment and spares, but
this is being overcome with assistance under IDA's First Highway Project,
a Japanese credit and the Arab-Kuwait Fund project. In addition, RBPC will
take over equipment from ongoing construction projects on their completion.
Thus the maintenance fleet will be adequate. Considerable improvements
have occurred during the last few years through assistance under IDA's First
Highway Project and other multi- and bi-lateral aid. However, apart from the
need to protect the network by enforcing axle load limits (para. 2.10),
several deficiencies persist. First, and most important, management and
particularly procurement procedures are still unsatisfactory. Second, exist-
ing workshops require improvements and new workshops are needed. Third,
training is still somewhat lacking. Fourth, and finally, although RBPC's
expenditures for routine and recurrent maintenance increased from ESd 45,000
(US$90,000) in 1971/72 to about ESd 250,000 (US$500,000) in 1977/78, they
are still insufficient to maintain the paved roads. With the paved network
expected to double over the next five years, expenditures on routine and
recurrent maintenance will need to reach hSd 1.6 million (US$3.2 million) by
1982/83 (excluding depreciation of equipment, and expressed in 1979 prices).
Funds for periodic maintenance, allocated from the development budget, have
been made available when required.
2.27      The first three of the above listed deficiencies are being addressed
under ongoing projects. Management, training and main workshop facilities are
considerably improving through technical assistance and equipment provided
under IDA's First Highway Project and further assistance will be provided
under the Arab-Kuwait Fund Project. The Government is presently considering
simplification of the complicated and cumbersome procurement procedures. On
the need to increase maintenance expenditures, a covenant of the First Highway
Project Credit Agreement requires that the Government prepare and agree with
IDA a program for the maintenance of Sudan's road network and take all neces-
sary steps to implement the program. Such a program based on the Berger
Study will be finalized shortly. Agreement was reached with Government that
a five-year plan satisfactory to the Association for the adequate maintenance
of the road network as well as an annual program for the implementation of
such plan (including maintenance works to be done under the program and the
amount of funds allocated therefor) would be prepared and provided to the



- 22 -
Association not later than September 30, 1979 and annim.-J3y theerafter on the
same date in each of the five following years (para. 5.0l (c))3  Implementa-
tion of the new maintenance plan will receive assistance under the Arab--Kuwait
Fund's Highway Project.
2.28       Because the road network in the south was in a state of complete
disrepair after two decades of neglect during and followniU  the Citvil War, the
first priority has been to mount an extensive rehabilitation program to render
the roads maintainable (para. 2.23). The support which IDA provided for the
rehabilitation program under the First Highway Project will be extended
under the proposed project by the provision of workshops, technical assistance
and some additional equipment (para. 3.07). This capacity will be
used initially for rehabilitation work, but progressively for maintenance as
the various bilaterally financed rehabilitation units complete their projects
and pass the roads over to SRMCTR for maintenance, By 1982/83, SRMCTR will be
required to maintain over 2,000 km of gravel roads. With the equipment being
provided by IDA, and that which SRMCTR will inherit from the bilateral proj-
ects, it should be adequately equipped. However, the non-wage recurrent
maintenance budget will have to rise from its present level of {LSd 70,000
(US$140,000) to ESd 680,000 (US$1.4 million) (excluding depreciation) by
1982/83, and the Southern Regional Government gave an assurance to this effect
(para. 5.02(a)). A further increase will be required in the following
years, because all roads taken over by SRMCTR by 1982/83 will be recently
rehabilitated, and the length of rehabilitated roads wi11 increase every year.
The technical assistance provided under the project will prepare a maintenance
program for the Southern Region (Annex 2).
2.29      Although most maintenance carried out in the Region is plant-
intensive, some routine maintenance is labor-intensive. SRMCTR has divided
the existing main roads network into 10 km sections, each maintained by
a gang of 12 men. Supervision is, however, lax and waRe paynents have been
delayed up to three months on occasions, which tends to undennine a system of
routine maintenance that is otherwise adequate for the present road and
traffic conditions on most of the Region's network. The proposed project
provides for technical assistance to improve the supervision of mnaintenance
operations (para. 3.07), and the Southern Regional Convernment gave an assurance
to improve the efficiency of its budget administration to allow timrely payment
of wages (para. 5.02(b)).
2.30      Almost all the roads to be maintained by provAinial. autthorities
are only tracks in open country where vehicles can, in fact. select their own
route at will during the dry season, but which are generally impassable in the
rains due to the heavy clay soil. Under these conditiois maintenance is very
difficult and is mostly neglected due to the shortage of futids, extremely
limited equipment and skilled manpower, and the complete lack of rmaintenance
organizations.  As noted in para. 2.11, there is a need L<o d,c-velop .a mainte-
nance capacity at this level, but the more immediate reqtuirement is to develop
such capacity in RBPC and SRMCTR.

I. Training
2.31      Most of RBPC's professionals are graduates from the University
of Khartoum. Many of them have taken or are taking postgraduate studies
abroad under grants from bilateral sources and a few have attended EDI
courses in Khartoum and Washington. Practical training of RBPC's engineers,
surveyors and foremen is provided through on-the-job counterpart training
included in all ongoing road construction contracts and one force account
construction project. Lower echelon staff, such as mechanics, operators and
drivers, are trained in RBPC's main workshop at Khartoum as well as on-the-
job on all construction contracts and projects. IDA's ongoing First Highway
Project is providing for technical assistance for the training of mechanics,
operators and laboratory technicians. That project also required RBPC to
set up a formal training program for all staff, an outline of which has been
prepared and discussed with IDA. The Arab-Kuwait Fund Project is providing
technical assistance for the preparation and implementation of the detailed
training program. This addition to the ongoing training under IDA's First
Highway Project is considered satisfactory for RBPC's activities for the next
few years.
2.32      Training of SRMCTR's staff had been largely neglected until 1974
when UNDP started its Road Improvement Project in the Southern Region,
followed by bilaterally financed projects and IDA's First Highway Project.
These projects have conducted on-the-job counterpart training for mechanics,
operators, drivers and supervisors. The IDA-financed technical assistance
withdrew due to the lack of accommodations and support services, both of
which are being provided by other agencies for their staff. Training of
SRMCTR's staff is still unsatisfactory and the proposed project includes a
training specialist, counterpart training by other technical assistance
experts, facilities, equipment and tools as well as accommodations and
support services (para. 3.07 and Annex 2).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The primary objective of the proposed project is to assist the
Government in the general strategy of achieving a more equitable and balanced
pattern of economic and social growth by constructing a major trunk road to
serve the White Nile Province, by promoting the improvement and maintenance of
roads in the Southern Region, and by providing for design of new extensions
to the road network.
B. Description
3.02      The proposed project consists of:



- 24 -
(a)  construction of a two-lane bituminous surfaced road
between Jebel Aulia and Ed Dueim (158 km) including an
improved ferry crossing and two ferries at Ed Dueim and a
permanent weighbridge at a site to be determined;
(b) consulting services for:
(i) detailed engineering of the Jebel Aulia-Rabak
road (for which retroactive financing is
proposed);
(ii) supervision of construction of the Jebel Aulia-
Ed Dueim road;
(iii)  detailed engineering of about 500 km of roads
yet to be identified; and
(c)  assistance in strengthening SRMCTR's Roads Department by
provision of technical assistance (including housing and
vehicles), workshops, offices, equipment, spares and
fuel.
(a) Road Construction
3.03       The road will run from Jebel Aulia, which is already linked to
Khartoum by a 35 km bituminous-paved road, along the east bank of the White
Nile to Abu Hibeira, where an improved ferry crossing will provide a link
to the west bank town of Ed Dueim, the capital of the White Nile Province.
With this improved crossing, plus the existing crossings at El Geteina, Wad
Ez Zaki and Shabasha (see Map 13452R) the road will serve both sides of the
White Nile.  The new road crosses flat terrain, and the alignment generally
follows the present group of tracks that are passable during the dry season
but, due to the silty-clayey soils and undrained terrain, become completely
impassable during and after rain. Under the project, the road and the link
(6 km) to the Ed Dueim ferry crossing will be constructed to a two-lane
bituminous standard. The project will also provide for two new ferries and
improved landing facilities on both sides of the White Nile, and for a per-
manent weighbridge to assist in enforcing axle-load limits for the road.
3.04       Detailed engineering for the road construction and ferries was
prepared by a joint venture between L. Berger International (USA) and Kampsax
(Denmark) and is satisfactory. The proposed road design standards are appro-
priate for the forecast traffic. They are based on a design speed of 120
km/h, a maximum gradient of 3% and a minimum curve radius of 1,000 m. The
pavement structure will be crushed stone base course with a double 7.0 m
wide bituminous surface treatment and a 1.5 m wide shoulder on each side.
3.05      The proposed new ferries will be capable of carrying up to 6 truck-
trailer combinations. The ferries are designed for ease of handling and fast
turnaround. The two ferries will be capable of handling forecast traffic
up to 1992 when a third one will be required.  The embankments to the ferry



- 25 -
landings will be constrticted on the alignment of a future bridge in such a
way that whien and if a bridge becomes feasible, all earthworks would be
incorporated in the approaches to the bridge. Ferries would be able to
operate throughout the bridge construction period.
(b) Consulting Services
3.06      The project provides for consulting services for the following
purposes:
(i) detailed engineering of the Jebel Aulia--Rabak road and
ferries, temporarily financed by the Government but origi-
nally scheduled to be financed under the ongoing First
Highway Project and deleted due to lack of funds. It is
therefore proposed that payments since April 1, 1977 for
this work, which was carried out by consultants employed
under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, be financed
retroactively under the project;
(ii)  supervision of the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road construction;
and
(iii)  in preparation for future projects, for detailed engineering
of about 500 km of roads. These roads will be selected on
the basis of recently completed or ongoing feasibility
studies of some 2,000 km of roads and a study, in progress,
to prepare a master plan for feeder roads. The actual roads
selected will be agreed between the Government and IDA.
(c)  Assistatce to the SRMCTR
3.07      The project would assist the SRMCTR in strengthening its Roads
Department by providing for the following components:
(i) Technical Assistance
(a)  348 man-months (12 individuals) of technical assistance
to fill key positions in the Department for three years
and to train local counterparts. Detailed composition
and qualifications of the technical assistance, which
ranges from senior engineers to plant operators, were
agreed with Government (para. 5.01(d)),, as were terms of
reference (Annex 2);
(b) permanent housing and vehicles for the above experts which
would be available to Government after their departure.
(ii) Offices and Worksiops
Workshops and stores at SRMCTR's Juba yard are
extremely defcient. The project provides for
about 1,300 m of workshops, stores and asso-
ciated office space, as well as workshop equip-
ment and tools and office equipment.



- 6
(iii) Maintenance Equipment
Some key equipment is needed to complement the exist-
ing fleet. It was agreed with Governiment that the
following equipment would be procured under the project
(para. 5.01(e)): 3 graders, 3 small concrete mixers,
3 mobile workshops (truck-motnted), 2 lowbed trailers
and tractors, 2 farm tractors, 2 light rollers, 2 caravans
(for expatriate staff in the field), 1 wheel loader, 1
track-type loader and I bulldozer.
(iv) Spares and Fuel
A large part of the existing equipment fleet is
presently either immobilized or ineffectively
utilized because of a shortage of spares and fuel,
in turn attributable to lack of foreign exchange
(para. 2.23). The project provides for financing
an initial inventory of spares and the year-by-year
increments in foreign exchange expenditures on fuel
necessary to achieve full equipment utilization by
1981/82; until that time, equipment would be used
primarily (over 80%) for rehabilitation work.
Financing of these increments would be related to
SRMCTR's performance in increasing its maintenance
expenditures in accordance with targets agreed at
negotiations.
C. Cost Estimates
3.08      Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$51.7
million with a foreign exchange component of US$41.0 million or 79%. Total
cost excluding taxes and duties of about 5% is US$49.0 million. Detailed
costs are provided in Table 3.1.
3.09      The base costs are estimated as of mid-1978 (after the devaluation
of the Sudanese Pound) and have been derived as follows:
(a) Road Construction: The appraisal cost estimate for the
Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road was derived from consultants'
estimates based on final design quantities. Estimated
costs (excluding ferries and contingencies) average
US$175,000 per km which appears reasonable in the light
of bids recently received for similar works. In a
detailed analysis, the consultants estimate the foreign
exchange component of construction at 80%. This
component includes depreciation of equipment, imported

1/ The foreign exchange component of the base cost of road construction is 80% as of mid-1978; it will,
however, decrease to 79% of total cost during the construction period due to higher escalation rates
for local cost than for foreign cost (see footnote 4 of this table),

materials, fuel, spare parts, the foreign expense of
expatriate personnel, overhead costs and profits. The
local component comprises mainly labor and taxes.
(b) Consulting Services: Cost of consulting services for
supervision of road construction is estimated on the basis
of 245 man-months at a unit cost of about US$6,000 per
man-month which is in line with recent experience in Sudan.
Cost of the detailed engineering of the Jebel Aulia-Rabak
road is an actual cost. Costs for the other detailed
engineering were estimated on the basis of 240 man-months
at an average cost of US$6,500 per man-month.
(c) Assistance to SRMCTR: Costs of technical assistance are
estimated on the basis of 348 man-months at a cost of
US$6,500 per man-month. Cost of buildings (houses, work-
shops, offices) is based on similar works currently being
undertaken in Juba. Costs for equipment, vehicles and fuel
are based on market prices.
D. Financing
3.10      Government would finance all local costs, the equivalent of US$8.0
million net of taxes and duties. The IDA credit would finance the total
foreign cost of US$41 million equivalent (84% of project cost net of taxes
and duties).
E. Implementation and Procurement
3.11      The RBPC will be responsible for the execution of the project apart
from the assistance to the Southern Region for which SRMCTR will be respon-
sible.  Construction of the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road will be executea under a
unit price contract awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Prequalification has been completed
and tenders will be sought shortly, with construction expected to begin at the
start of the 1979/80 dry season and to be completed by the middle of 1982.
The ferries will be procured through ICB in accordance with Bank Group guide-
lines. The weighbridge, which is expected to cost about US$60,000, will be
procured from the same source as six other weighbridges to be procured by RBPC
(para. 2.10).
3.12       Supervision of the road construction and the carrying out of
detailed engineering will be by consultants employed under terms and condi-
tions agreed between Government and the Association (para. 5.01(f)). It was
also agreed that, not later than December 31, 1979, a list of roads selected
for detailed engineering under the project will be submitted to the Associa-
tion for its approval (para. 5.01 (g)).



- 29 -
3.13      The number and qualifications of technical assistants for SRMCTR
were agreed with Government as were their terms of reference (para. 5.01
(d) and Annex 2); they will be employed under contracts agreed between Gov-
ernment and the Association. The number and type of equipment were also
agreed (para 5.01(e)). In view of the diversity of types and the few num-
bers of each type of equipmenit and vehicles, procurement of these items,
which will be administered by the technical assistants, will be through
local and international comparative shopping. The housing and buildings
(estimated to cost about US$920,000) will be constructed by local contractors
following competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Association and
administered by the technical assistants or, if bidding is unsuccessful, by
force account. Spares for existing equipment will be identified by the tech-
nical assistants and procured from the original equipment supplier or spe-
cialist parts suppliers after comparative shopping. While recruitment of
most of the technical assistance experts would be phased to match completion
of accommodations, workshops and offices and arrival of equipment and vehi-
cles, a few experts would be needed at the project's start in early 1979 to
administer tendering of buildings and procurement of equipment, vehicles and
spares; temporary housing for these experts is presently being sought by
SRMCTR. The Southern Regional component should be completed by the end of
1983.
3.14      Agreement was reached on a project implementation schedule (Chart 3)
and project reporting requirements (Annex 3) which include indices for measur-
ing implementation and the submission of a project completion report, in a
form satisfactory to the Association, not later than six months after the
Closing Date (para. 5.01(h)).
F. Disbursements
3.15      IDA Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 79% of expenditures on construction of the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim
road (including ferry crossing ramps and procurement and
installation of the weighbridge); 1/
(b) 72% of expenditures on civil works for SRMCTR; 2/
(c)  67% of total expenditures, or 100% of foreign expenditures,
on vehicles, equipment and spares for SRMCTR;
(d) 80% of total incremental expenditures, or 100% of incremental
foreign expenditures, on fuel for SRMCTR; and
(e) 100% of foreign expenditures on all other project components.
1/   See Table 3.1, footnote 1.
2/   See Table 3.1, footnote 2.



- 30 -
It is recommended that IDA finance retroactively US$530,000 to meet the
foreign exchange component of consultants' fees for the detailed engineering
of the Jebel Aulia-Rabak road, including preparation of tender documents for
the Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road. IDA financing of year-by-year increments in
foreign exchange expenditures on fuel by SRMCTR's Roads Department would be
related to the Department's performance in increasing its maintenance expend-
itures in accordance with targets agreed at negotiations. For example, if
only 80% of the target is met in any year, IDA would only finance 80% of that
year's incremental foreign exchange expenditure on fuel.
3.16      Disbursements for any expenditures under force account for civil
works included in Part C of Table 3.1 will be made against certificates of
expenditure, the documentation for which is not submitted for review but is
retained by the Borrower and available for inspection by the Association
during the course of project supervision missions.
3.17      An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.2.

IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The road construction component will significantly reduce vehicle
operating costs and travel times in the important Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim cor-
ridor. Although the road runs along the eastern bank of the White Nile, it
will also serve the western bank via the four ferry crossing points along
its length (including the one at Ed Dueim, which will be improved under the
project) (see Map IBRD 13452R). The immediate area of influence, with a
population of about 400,000, includes the western portion of the large-scale
Gezira irrigation scheme, several small-scale pump irrigation schemes spread
along the river, and the cotton ginnery at Ed Dueim. Under the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program, a project to rehabilitate these pump irrigation schemes
is being prepared, and is expected to be submitted for Bank Group financing.
The southward extension of the project road, from Ed Dueim to Rabak (109 km),
which is included in the Government's Six-Year Plan and proposed for Arab Fund
financing, would serve additional pump irrigation schemes, the cotton gin-
neries at Rabak and Kosti, and the Hagar-Asalaya and Kenana sugar schemes.
The road forms part of a trunk route fed by important penetration roads
running southwest from Ed Dueim and west, south and east from Rabak, all of
which either are being improved or are likely to be improved during the next
decade. It thus carries dura, groundnuts, sesame and fish from western and
southern Sudan to Khartoum, the trucks returning with consumer goods.
4.02      The assistance to SRMCTR should result in more efficient road
administration generally in the south, and especially in improved and expanded
rehabilitation and maintenance work, with consequent improvements in access
and savings in transport costs. Lack of all-weather access throughout virtu-
ally the whole Southern Region has been a major barrier to development. By
assisting SRMCTR's rehabilitation program (Table 2.2) and promoting the
subsequent maintenance of the rehabilitated network, the project will help
remove this barrier, and in particular will facilitate the implementation of
ongoing and planned IDA-assisted projects in the education and agricultural
sectors in the Southern Region.
4.03      Benefits deriving from the detailed engineering of 500 km of roads
cannot be meaningfully quantified; this work is, however, a prerequisite
for subsequent improvement of stuch roads which will yield benefits similar to
those just discussed.
B. Traffic Projections
4.04      Because the new road will serve both sides of the White Nile, it
has been necessary to analyze traffic in the whole corridor between Jebel



- 33 -
Aulia and Ed Dueim, The traffic projections used by IDA, which are essentially
those made by the consultants BCEOM in their 1976 feasibility study (Annex
4, No. 2) relate to six separate sections of road, and reflect:
(a)  counts made of traffic on the existing tracks on both
sides of the White Nile in 1973 by Berger and in 1975
by BCEOM;
(b) estimates of future growth in traffic for the whole
corridor based on normal growth of non-agricultural
traffic plus projected output from the various agri-
cultural schemes;
(c) estimates of the volume of traffic which will divert
from the tracks on the west side of the river to the
new bituminous-paved road on the east side; and
(d) estimates of the volume of new traffic likely to be
generated by the new road.
It is estimated that light vehicle traffic will grow at 9% per year through-
out the analysis period (up to 2002), while heavy traffic will grow at 7%
per year. It is assumed that the new road would generate new traffic equiva-
lent to about 25% 1/ of that which would have existed in the absence of the
improvement, and that this generated traffic will also grow at the above-
mentioned rates. The resulting traffic projections are detailed in Table 4.1.
C. Rate of Return Analysis
4.05      To compute the rate of return, costs and benefits, both expressed
net of taxes and in mid-1978 prices, have been compared over a 25-year analysis
period. A shadow foreign exchange rate of ESd 1 = US$1.75 has been used.
Costs consist of initial construction cost (including ferries, construction
supervision and physical contingencies), an overlay which would be required by
1990/91, road maintenance costs, plus the cost of refurbishing the two initial
ferries for the Ed Dueim crossing, and adding a third (because of traffic
growth) in 1992/93. It is assumed that at the end of the analysis period
the road would have a residual value equivalent to 25% of initial cost, rep-
resenting the value of drainage structures, base and sub-base, all of which
should be in sound condition because of regular maintenance and the overlay
applied in 1989/90-90/91.
1/   Because the quality of the existing track and traffic characteristics
vary from one section to another, generated traffic also varies, and
the 25% represents a weighted average for all sections of the new road.

4.06      The only benefits which have been incorporated in the analysis
are vehicle operating cost savings. Savings were computed using the unit
operating costs shown in Table 4.2. Because existing track conditions
vary considerably from section to section, they were considered in three
categories.

4.07      Benefits for traffic which would have existed in the corridor even
without the new road were computed by comparing total vehicle operating costs
in the corridor with and without the improvement. Benefits for traffic gen-
erated by the new road were computed by applying half the unit rate of bene-
fits to the volume of such traffic for each section of the new road.
4.08      The resulting cost and benefit streams are shown in Table 4.3.
The estimated rate of return is 14%. The first year rate of return would
be 11% after applying interest of 10% per year to construction costs until
the opening year of the road, 1982.
D. Risks
4.09      The major project risk is that construction costs could be higher
than estimated. However, construction costs expressed in constant price
terms would have to be 40% higher than the cost estimates (which already
include a 10% allowance for physical contingencies) before the rate of
return would fall below 10%. The sensitivity of the rate of return to the
traffic projections has also been tested; traffic growth would have to be
less than half of that assumed before the rate of return would fall below 10%.

4.10      Another risk is that RBPC may fail to adequately maintain the
Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim roads However, agreement with Government on targets for
RBPC's annual maintenance e- penditures and assistance from the Arab and Kuwait
Funds in implementing RBPCfs maintenance program (para. 2.27) would serve to
minimize this risk.
4.11      Risks associated with the assistance to SRMCTR include possible
difficulties in attracting and retaining technical assistance, implementation
delays, and lack of counterpart funds and staff. The project seeks to over-
come the difficulties experienced with technical assistance under the First
Highway Project by providing accommodations, as is the practice with similar
bilaterally financed projects in the Southern Region, and improved conditions
of service generally. Making SRMCTR the executing authority, providing
technical assistance for procurement, and using the supply route through Kenya
rather than Port Sudan should minimize implementation delays. The project
provides funds for spares and fuel, while requiring as a condition that
Government progressively meet an increasing proportion of fuel expenditures.
Given the general manpower situation in the Southern Region, counterpart staff
are unlikely to be available in the numbers that would be desirable, and the
Roads Department will doubtless continue to need substantial expatriate
support after the completion of this project. However, the project should
make an effective start in training available local staff, and should improve
career opportunities in roads administration for such staff.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMNDATIONS
5.01      Government has agreed:
(a)  that by June 30, 1979, it will complete the study on road-
user taxes, and will exchange views with the Association on
plans to implement the recommendations resulting from the
study (para. 2.19);
(b)  that by December 31, 1979, it will adopt adequate geometric
design standards satisfactory to the Association for road
construction and would cause RBPC and SRMCTR to comply with
such standards (paras. 2.20-2.21);
(c)  that a five--year plan satisfactory to the Association for
the adequate maintenance of the road network as well as an
annual program for the implementation of such plan (including
maintenance works to be done under the program and the amount
of funds allocated therefor) would be prepared and provided
to the Association not later than September 30, 1979, and
annually thereafter on the same date in each of the five
following years (para. 2.27);



- 38 -
(d) on the composition, terms of reference and qualifications of
technical assistants to be provided under the project for
SRMCTR's Roads Department (paras. 3.07, 3.13);
(e) on the numbers and type of equipment to be procured for
SRMCTR (para. 3.07);
(f) that consultants and technical assistants will be employed
on terms and conditions agreed between Government and the
Association (para. 3.12);
(g) that not later than December 31, 1979, a list of roads
selected for detailed engineering under the project will
be submitted to the Association for its approval (para. 3.12);
(h) on a project implementation schedule, progress reporting
requirements, and the submission of a project completion
report (para. 3.14).
5.02      Also the Southern Regional Government has given an assurance that it
will (a) increase its budget allocations for maintenance in accordance with
targets agreed with IDA (para. 2.28); and (b) improve the efficiency of its
budget administration to enable timely payment of wages (para. 2.29).
5.03      The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$41 million to the
Republic of the Sudan on standard terms.

V.  Manuals and Reports
Because this is basically an implementation-training project, all
manuals shall be performance-oriented and most reports shall be directed
toward documenting accomplishments and results. The technical assistance
team shall prepare a report on future highway maintenance needs and manuals
on road maintenance, equipment management and maintenance, accounting and
budgeting, administration and training.
VI. Executing Government Agency and Counterpart Staff
SRMCTR will be the contracting Government agency. Counterpart
personnel will be provided from among permanent employees of SRMCTR to work
with the technical assistance. It is expected that both professional and
support staff will be required.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN
Project Reporting Requirements
A.   Project Progress Reports
1.        The borrower will prepare Progress Reports that should be submitted
quarterly in triplicate, no later than one calendar month after the end of
the quarter. The first report should cover the quarter ending September 30,
1979.
2.        The information that Progress Reports should contain is described
below.
(a)  General information:  this section should refer to
Project Monitoring indices (Attachment 1) in reporting
the following:
(i)  the physical progress accomplished during the
reporting period;
(ii) actual or expected deviations from the project
implementation schedule;
(iii)  actual or expected difficulties or delays and
their effects on the implementation schedule,
and the steps planned or taken to overcome
the difficulties and avoid further delay;
(iv) expected changes in the completion date of the
project;
(v)  key personnel changes in the staffs of the RBPC,
SRMCTR, consultants or contractor;
(vi) matters which may affect the cost of the project;
and
(vii)  any development activity likely to affect the
economic viability of project components.
(b) A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementation
scheduled, should show the progress in each project component.



- 52 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 3
(c) A financial statement should be set out in the tabular form
and indicate for each project component:
(i) original estimated cost;
(ii) revised cost, if appropriate;
(iii) actual expenditure;
(iv) projected expenditure; and
(v)  actual and projected withdrawals from the Credit Account.
(d)  Finally, Progress Reports should state the status of action
on each covenant of the Credit Agreement; including monitoring
indices for highway maintenance (Attachment 2).
3.        Progress Reports will be an important input in the preparation of
the Project Completion Report.
B.   Project Completion Report
4.        The borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to be
submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the Closing
Date.
5.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation by
the Borrower and the Association's operating departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project:
(a)  the performance by the Borrower and the Association of
their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement
and whether the Association could have been more helpful;
(b)  the results that can be expected from the project, as
compared with expectations at appraisal, and whether
the original expectations were realistic; and
(c)  whether in retrospect the project was worth 'doing or
could have been done better.
6.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return was
estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calculation should
be as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a
minor portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex
with the relevant information supporting this analysis should be included.

ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 3
7.        The basic documents to be referred to are:
Credit application.
Feasibility studies, preappraisal report, project brief.
Appraisal report.
Credit Agreement documents, supplementary letters, etc.
Supervision Reports.
Quarterly Progress Reports.
Project Correspondence Files.
Miscellaneous evaluation reports.
8.        The Highways Division, Eastern Africa Projects Department, will
review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs Department.
After approval by the Highway Division Chief, the PCR is sent to the Bank
Group's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) which is responsible for
conducting an audit of the project subsequent to the PCR exercise. This audit
can lead to suggestions for changes or additions in the PCR as OED prepares
the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for submission to the Bank Group's
Board of Directors. Before going to the Board, the draft PPAR which includes
the PCR, is sent to various Bank Group divisions, to the Government and
occasionally to consultants (especially if they have been criticized).
