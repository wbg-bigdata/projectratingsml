PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a project completion report of two closely related,
complementary projects in the Colombian water sector, namely, the Second
Bogota Water Supply Project, for which Loan 741-CO was approved in May 1971
in the sum of US$88.0 million, and the Third Bogota Water Supply, Sewerage
and Drainage Project, for which Loan 1697-CO was approved in May 1979 in
the sum of US$30.0 million. While Loan 741-CO was fully disbursed, US$2.13
million was cancelled under Loan 1697-CO.
The project completion report of March 31, 1987, was prepared by
the Latin America and Caribbean Projects Department on the basis of
documents contained in regional files and information provided by staff
members involved with the projects during their execution. The Borrower,
also the executing agency under both loans (Empresa de Acueducto y
Aleantarillado de Bogota, EAAB), was helpful in providing project
completion data which are available in the files. The Borrower's opinion
is attached as Annex 13.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project perform-ce
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for comments,
however, none were received.

COLOMBIA
LOAN 741-CO, SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 1697-CO, THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE
AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The two projects represented the Bank's continuing involvement
with the Bogota Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EAAB)in the expansion of
water resources and in the improvement of water supply, sewerage and
drainage in the Bogota metropolitan area.  The urban poor were the major
targeted beneficiaries of the planned improvements.   The projects also
supported technical assistance programs to address the problems of flood
control and pollution abatement in the Bogota River and to seek remedial
uaasures.    The objectives  of the projects were  consistent with  the
Government's  water  development  strategy  for  Bogota.    The  combined
achievements of both projects were impressive in that they expanded the
water and sewerage services to an additional 2.3 million population
which, in terms of percent coverage, exceeded appraisal targets (para.
7.01).
The physical components of the projects (paras. 2.04 and 2.05)
were executed satisfactorily, albeit with delays, which were highly
pronounced in the case of the Chingaza water scheme of the Second Bogota
Project. The implementation of the Chingaza tunnel contract was marred by
problems with a first contractor and construction difficulties, the latter
arising from complex technical factors relating to a difficult geology of
the area (paras. 3.04 and 3.12).  Because of a lower-than-projected water
demand, the impact of dslays of the Chingaza tunnel construction was rather
minimal. Project cost overruns of the Chingaza components, changing urban
development patterns, and lower per capita water consumption levels -- all
these factors plus the financial constraints of EAAB, led to modifications
in the scope of both the Second and Third Bogota Projects (para. 3.03).
The Second Bogota Project was implemented during 1971-83  (against an
appraisal target of 1971-77) and the Third Bogota Project, during 1979-85
(against the target of 1979-82).
A major highlight of the Second Bogota Project was its
dual-sector purpose, providing increased water supply to EAAB on one hand
and substantial hydroelectric power benefits to the Bogota Power Company
(Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota, EEEB) on the other hand.  The
Chingaza diversion scheme represented a major first step of a coordinated
water resources development plan in the Bogota region for water supply and
power generation purposes.   In light of the power benefits, EEEB also
contributed to the financing of the project and agreed to share EAAB's
debt-servicing of the Bank loan.
Lessons learned from implementation of the projects were applied
in the preparation of the Fourth Bogota Project where a greater care was
given to estimating water :>mand and consumption levels, to undertaking
more detailed surveys for complex works such as tunnels prior to bidding,
and co adopting a more realistic implementation schedule than in the pro-
jects reviewed he-e.



- vii -
EAAB'   finances  declined  during  a  major  part  of  project
implementation period --particularly during 1971-75 and 1980-82-- on
account of its lower-than-estimated water sales (which also represented an
underutilization of its production capacity) and prcoloet cost overruns,
particularly  of  the  Chingaza  scbeme.    This  situation  was  further
exacerbated by insufficient and untimely tariff increases which were, to a
large extent, beyond the control of SAAB (para. 5.02).  Even though BAAB
had well qualified staff, its financial management systems became strained
during the final years of the project due to a rapidly increasing servioe
coverage brought about by the two projects. To address this problem, an
institutional strengthening program has been included in the Fourth Bogota
Water Supply Project (Loan 2512-CO).
Overall, EAAB was --and still remains-- a well-run water and
sewerage agency.   Its ratio of staff per 1000 connections, which was
notably reduced from 7.9 to 4.9 during the project-period, ranked one of
the lowest for similar water and sewerage utilities in the Latin JAmerica
region (para. 4.05).
Unaccounted-for water remained satisfactory during the period
1971-77. After this period, however, there was a significant increase in
the peroentage, from about 27% in 1977 to about 40% in 1983 when the
Chingaza system became operational (the problem of an increasing
unaccounted-for water, attendant with high operating pressures in old
distribution systems, has also been evidenced for similar systems in other
countries).  Water losses were also attributable to factors such as the
under-registration of consumption meters, illegal connections and unmetered
public standpipes.   Given the growth of marginal areas served, where
operating conditions are difficult and the anticipated increase in water
pressures, appraisal targets to reduce unaccounted-for water to less than
30% were optimistic, without a forceful program to reduce losses.  Because
of EAAB's lingering financial constraints, no systematic unaccounted-for
water control program could be put into practice under the two projeots.
This problem is currently addressed under the Bank-financed Fourth Bogota
Project (para. 4.04).
A detailed engineering design was completed for the recommended
first phase of the Bogota River floovl control project. Investigations were
also undertaken by EAAB to seek measures for treating the sewage generated
within the Bogota area and abating pollution in the river. The indicated
total cost of pollution abatement is however very high and hence interim
solutions are being sought by EAAB to minimize pollution levels in the
river.   In the area of flood and pollution control further studies are
needed to address the associated issues of cost recovery, urban development
patterns, and the roles of the Bogota regional and local planning agencies
for project implementation.   Funds have been provided under the Fourth
Bogota Projeot to undertake above studies (para. 3.05).

LOAN 741-CO, SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 1697-CO, THIRD BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE
AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project completion report (PCR) concerns the Second Bogota
Water Supply Project (Loan 741-CO) and the Third Bogota Water Supply,
Sewerage and Drainage Project (Loan 1697-CO) for which loan amounts of
US$80.0 million and US$30.0 million were approved in May 1971 and May 1979
respectively. The main objective of the projects was to improve the water
supply and sewerage service levels in the Bogota metropolitan area, to
develop a coordinated flood control and pollution abatement program for the
Bogota River BassA near and downstream of Bogota and to bring institutional
and financial improvements of the Bogota Water Supply and Sewerage Company
(Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota,  EAAB).   The second
project was implemented during 1971-83 (against appraisal-projected 1971-77
per'od) and the third project during 1979-85 (against appraisal-projected
1979-82 period).
1.02     The Bank's relationship with EAAB began in 1968 with the financing
of the Tibito II water scheme (First Bogota Water Supply Project; Loan
536-CO; Amount -  US$14.0 million; implementation period - 1968 through
1973), aimed to increase the capacity of Bogota's water supply from 5.5
m3/sec to 13.5 m3/sec, sufficient to eliminate the then existing water
deficit and keep ahead of demand through 1976.  The second loan, namely
Loan 741-CO, which is the subject of this PCR, represented a second stage
of the long-range Bogota water resources development plan which was to
coordinate the program for further expansion of the water system (to meet
demands through 1985) of diverting water from outside basins (particularly
the Chingaza River) into the Bogota River Basin, with the possibilities of
substantially increasing the hydroelectric power potential of the Bogota
River.  Loan 1697-CO, also the subject of this PCR, was the Bank's third
operation with EAAB, directed at improving the coverage of water
distribution networks, sewage collection, and drainage, particularly in the
low-income ("barrios marginales") areas of the city.  The above projects
were followed by the Fourth Bogota Water Supply and Sewerage Project in
1984 (Loan 2512-CO; Amount-US$129.0 million; ImrLementation period - 1985
through 1992) under which further expansions of the transmission and
distribution capacity of the system are currently carried out, together
with technical assistance to further strengthen EAAB in the areas of
finance and operations.



-2-
Main Conclusions
1.03     The basic objectives of water supply expansion and increased water
and sewerage service levels for the Bogota metropolitan area were
essentially met. Together, the two projects expanded the coverage of water
service from 77% to 96% of the population, and sewerage from 72% to 89%,
which  exceeded  appraisal  targets.    Loan  741-CO  provided  dual  sector
benefits in regard to expanding the water 9 ply by about 12 m3/sec through
the Chingaza (first phase) se,-eme as well as providing better-than-expected
hydroelectric power benefits to the Bogota Power Company (Empresa de
Energia Electrica de Bogota, EEEB). However, the technical complexity of
the above project, coupled with performance problems with a first
contractor as well as high inflation levels, resulted in a high cost
overrun  and  project  completion  delays.          The  coexistence  of  a
less-than-projected per capita water demand and lower population levels
led to an underutilization of the system capacity which caused a severe
financial burden to EAAB.   Project implementation delays also persisted
under Loan 1697-CO, which however, focussed successfully on secondary
water, sewerage and drainage networks in the low-income areas. Because of
changing urban development patterns as well as EAAB's lingering financial
constraints,  most  of the proposed  investments  for trunk sewerage and
drainage were deleted from above project scope.
1.04      Execution of the Bogota River Water Pollution Control Study and
the Bogota River Flood Control and Rectification Study was rather slow.
This resulted from an initial lack of active coordination and agreement
between EAAB and the Regional Bogota Plains Development Corporation
(Corporacion  Autonoma  Regional  de  la  Sabana  de  Bogota,  CAR).    The
implementation details of the above two studies remain to be further
defined under the Fourth Bogota Project.
1.05     Despite its financial constraints, and frequent changes in the top
level management during the overall project implementation period 1971-85,
EAAB managed to retain a strong institutional character.   It managed to
attract well qualified technical staff in its overall operations.
Improvements in budget planning, accounting and financial control were
introduced during the project period. EAAB's major weakness, however, was
in the area of operation and maintenance --with special regard to the
control of unaccounted-for water.   This problem is currenuly addressed
under the Fourth Bogota Project.
Sector Service Levels and Obiectives
1.06       In the 1970's, when both loans were appraised, about 73% of
Colombia's urban population (about 19 million in 1978) had access to water
through house connections and about 60% was served by sewerage systems.
Service levels in the rural areas were lower, with 40% of the rural
population having access to water through service connections, and 12% to
piped sewerage. The extent and quality of service were much better in the
larger urban areas than in the smaller cities.   In the large cities,



service was however deficient in the rapidly growing poor neighborhoods
as  evidenced  particularly  for  the  Bogota  metropolitan  area.    The
Government's initial efforts were focused on improving water coverage in
the major problem urban areas. To foster more balanced urban development
and to reduce migratory pressure on the large cities, the Government's
emerging policy was also to make living conditions more attractive in the
small-and medium-sized towns. Upgrading the infrastructure in these towns,
including water supply and sewerage,  thus had a high priority in the
Government's development plans.  The long-term goal was to extend water
supply and sewerage service coverage to about 80% and 70%, respectively, by
1980.  The Bank has supported the Government's objectives in the water and
sewerage sector through its participation in a total of 12 projects to date
(total Bank loan - about US$405 million), distributed as follows:  Bogota
Metropolitan area - 4 projects; and other urban areas - 8 projects.
Institutional Arrangements
1.07       At the time of project appraisal the sector was, and until
institutional reforms established by Presidential Decree in January 1987
are implemented by the end of 1988, still is, largely organized in a
centralized manner.'/ The Ministry of Health, in coordination with the
DNP,  is responsible  for formulating national  sectoral policies.   Two
institutions dependent on the Ministry of Health --the National Institute
of Urban Development (INSFOPAL) and the National Institute of Health--are
responsible for implementing sector policies in urban and rural areas,
respectively. Both of these institutions have planning, supervisory, and
technical assistance functions and act as financial intermediares for
domestic and external resources for sector investments.
1.08       On the departmental and municipal level, different types of
institutions are responsible for providing water and sewerage services.
Some 35 autonomous municipal water companies (including EAAB for the Bogota
District are responsible for providing water and sewerage services, as well
as solid waste and other municipal services in many instances in Colombia'a
largest cities.  Some 25 departmental companies, of which INSFOPAL is the
principal shareholder and/or controlling entity provide water and sewerage
services  in  some  450  smaller  municipalities.    In  some  other  300
municipalities, the municipal administrations manage the services directly,
without any formal ties to departmental or central government authorities.
I/ Under the Presidential Decree of January 15, 1987, aimed to reorgan-
ize the water and sewerage sector operations, the Ministry of Public
works will assume responsibility for sector oversight. The operational
responsibilities of INSFOPAL will be transferred to the regional and
local water and sewerage companies.   INSFOPAL itself will cease to
exist. The Financial Fund for Urban Development (FFDU) of the Central
Mortgage Bank (BCH), will be the primary technical and financial
intermediary for sector investments.



In  the  rural areas, individual communities construct the systems and
operate the services in accordance with principles established by the
Ministry of Health.
Project Area
1.09       Both projects were located in the Special District of Bogota,
which is the capital of Colombia. Bogota's population was estimated to be
3.8 million in 1978, accounting for about 15% of the then total population
of Colombia and 24% of the urban population.  At the appraisal of Loan
741-CO in 1971, about 77% of Bogota population received piped water and
about 72% had access to EAAB sewerage or drainage system.  Because of its
metropolitan characteristics, Bogota has had one of the country's highest
urban population growth rates (close to 7.0% in the early 1970's). This,
coupled with the ample space for expansion, meant that the demand for
public services would continue to grow rapidly over the years.  EAAB was
also faced with the additional problem of providing water, sewerage and
drainage services to several low-income towns beyond the limits of the
Special Diatrict of Bogota.
Borrower and Executing Agency
1.10     EAAB was the Borrower and Executing Agency for both loais, 741-CO
and  1697-CO.    It  is  an  autonomous  public  enterprise  owned  by  the
Municipality of the Special District of Bogota. It was organized in 1955
under a Municipal Decree and has the responsibility for planning,
constructing, ail operating alL water supply, sewerage, and drainage
facilities in the Special District. At appraisal, EAAB was governed by a
seven-member Board of Directors with the Mayor as the Chairman of the
Board.   The General Manager,, who is the Chief Executive  Officer, is
appointed by the Mayor. While EAAB is autonomous, its investment program
must be integrated with other development programs of the Municipality and
its tariffs approved by the National Tariff Board. Moreover, in matters
relating to the pollution control of the Bogota Aiver, EPAB is subject to
the oversight of CAR, agency which under DNP's supervision, is responsible
for water resources management and pollution control of the Bogota Plain.
At appraisal, EAAB consisted of 5 major departments, namely planning,
engineering, administration, operations, and finance (Chart 1).
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, APPRAISAL, AND NEGOTIATIONS
The Process
2.01      The specific origin of the Second Bogota Project loan to EHAB,
(Loan 741-CO), could be traced to the recommendations of the Chingaza
feasibility studies (1968) that EMB carried out with the assistance of
consultants under Loan 536-CO (para. 1.02). Appraisal of subject loan was
carried out in December 1970. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C.
during March 1971 with the Board Approval and Loan Signature taking place



-5-
in the following two months.  The main issues during project preparation
and negotiations related to the financial contribution to the Chingaza
scheme by the Bogota Power Company, EEEB, in light of the anticipated
additional hydro-power potential of the diverted flows into the Bogota
River.2/ Although an initial agreement was reached, subsequent project
implementation delays and cost overruns warranted RBAk to restudy in 1981
the power benefits  and  cost-sharing aspects of ZEEB.   After years of
protracted negotiations, EAAB and REEB reached a final agreement in early
1987 regarding the above issue.
2.02      While Loan 741-CO was primarily aimed at meeting Bogota's water
supply needs through 1985, it was EAAB's intent that subsequent investments
would be progressively planned to reinforce and extend the citywide
distribution network as well as improve waatewater collection and
drainage. In line with this, the Third Bogota Water project (Loan 1697-CO)
was prepared in 1978, based on a master plan study by consultants hired
under Loan 741-CO.   Because of a high cost overrun of the then ongoing
Chingaza scheme under Loan 741-CO and the consequent financial burdens on
kEAB, the Bank was justifiably concerned with the issues of EAAB's
financial constraints and the requisite mitigative measures during the
appraisal of the third loan.  In this connection, Bank's discussions with
EAAB were centered on the needs for the adoption of tariff increases and
improvements in the colleetion of valorization levies.3/ Loan 1697-CO was
negotiated in April 1979, with the Board Approval and Loan Signature taking
place in the following seven months.
Project Objectives
2.03        The sectoral objective  of both projects was to support the
government's policy of improving health and living conditions of Bogota's
residents through an expansion of water supply, sewerage and drainage
facilities. It was also intended under both loans to study ways of abating
pollution and controlling flood in the Bogota River. While EAAB's overall
management and financial systems were adequate, strengthening was to be
provided in specific areas of budgetary planning and assets revaluation.
Quantified project targets included: under Loan 741-CO, an expansion of
water supply by about 7.5 m3/sec and possibly up to 12.0 m3/sec;4/ and
2/ It was anticipated that the diversion of Chingaza water into the Bogota
River would more than double the river's average flow, resulting into a
considerable increase in the hydro-power generation potential.
3 The Bank's proposal with regard to EAkB being given the authority to
directly collect valorization on its own improvement works rather than
through the existing arrangement with the Bogota Special District
Authority (specifically, the Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano) could not
materialize due to legal complexities.
4/ This depended on the results of the then ongoing feasibility study on
the inclusion of the diversion of the Guatiquia River to the Chingaza
system.  The appraisal project cost did not include the cost of this
component which was anticipated to provide an additional 4 to 4.5
m3/sec at minimal cost (see footnote 6/ for further details).

under Loan 1697-CO, the provision of potable water to about 1.1 million
additional individuals (131,000 new connections) and severage to about 1.0
million additional individuals (123,000 new connections) with emphasis on
coverage for low-income areas.
Project Description
2.04      The Second Bog-ta Project, financed under Loan 741-CO, was to
consist of: (i) the first stage of the Chingaza scheme (a dam; a 33 km
tunnel-cum-pipeline transmission system;5/ a new treatment plant at El
Sapo location); (ii) further expansion and rehabilitation of the Bogota
water distribution system; (iii) provision of operational and other
equipment; and (iv) engineering services related to the design of the
project as well as to future schemes for sewerage, drainage, flood control,
and pollution control in the Bogota metropolitan area.
2.05      The Third Bogota project, financed under Loan 1697-C0, included
the following: (i) about 27 km water transmission mains and about 80 km of
secondary distribution mains; (ii) about 17 km of interceptors (to be built
along the main streams of the four river systems which arain the
metropolitan  area)  and  sewerage  networks  of  about  150  km;  (iii)
canalization of about 10 km of the main streams of the river systems noted
above; construction of 3 retention basins for flood control and storm-
water drainage networks; (iv) equipment purchase (including water meters,
construction and maintenance equipment, and vehicles); and (v) engineering
services related to the project and for the continuation of studies
(including design for the recommended first-phase) for the rectification of
the Bogota River and its pollution control aspects.
Conditions and Covenants
2.06      The Loan Agreement for Loan 741-CO focussed on a key financial
covenant for EAAB in meeting specified financial rates of return on
revalued fixed assets and for the national government agencies to clear
their past overdue water bills and start paying new water bills in a timely
manner. The conditions and covenants agreed under Loan 1697-CO related to
specified  financial  rates  of  return  as  well  as  establishment  of
coordination agreements with the Institute of Urban Development (Instituto
de Desarrollo Urbano), a Bogota city agency, for improved collection of
5/ For technico-economical reasons, the conveyance system was designed to
carry ultimate capacity (12m3/sec).



- 7 -
valorization charges (see footnote 3) and, with CAR and EEEB, for carrying
out the Bogota River Flood Control and Rectification Study.   To a large
measure, the stipulated covenants under both loans reflected the Bank's
desire to improve EAAB's finances and to seek an inter-agency coordination
in arriving at a concerted solution to the flood control and pollution
problems in the Bogota River.  Annex 1 presents the status of compliance
with covenants under both loans.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      Loan 741-CO was presented to the Board on May 27, 1971, after a
satisfactory execution of the key project cost-sharing agreement between
EkAB and EEEB. It became effective August 16, 1971 (there were no special
conditions of effectiveness).   The project had a relatively smooth start
with the continued appointment of key engineering consultants, who were
earlier involved in the Chingaza feasibility studies, and with the bidding
of the tunnel contract which was commenced in February 1971. Additional
detailed engineering for the Chingaza-related works and for the water
distribution system were well underway.
3.02         As with Loan 741-CO,  there were no special conditions of
effectiveness for Loan 1697-CO which was approved by the Board on May 15,
1979. The loan became effective on November 30, 1979. Even though most of
the detailed designs had been completed and the bidding could have been
commenced by loan effectiveness, EAAB began to suffer from start-up delays
due to the appointment at EAAB of a new management team unfamiliar with the
project.   This situation was further exacerbated by EkAB's deteriorating
financial condition and its failure to secure investment funds (US$20
million) from a commercial bank during the early months of project
start-up.
Revisions
3.03     Major revisions in project scope, as indicated in Annexes 2 and 3,
included:   (a) under Loan 741-CO:   (i) addition of new diversion works
(Guatiquia tunnel)6/ aimed to increase water yield by 4.5 m3/sec at a
6/ Even though not included in the original project cost estimate, the
construction of the Guatiquia diversion works was recommended at
appraisal, subject to the outcome of additional studies on technical
and economic justification.   Large capacity increases resulting from
the low cost addition (about US$2.0 million) of the Guatiquia tunnel to
the Chingaza scheme, and its associated incremental power benefits were
the major justification factors that led to the undertaking of the
Guatiquia works.



minimal cost; and (ii) deletion of a 25 1m major water transmission line
(TJsaquen-Parque Nacional-Casablanca) and about 50 km of primary distri-
bution lines, to compensate for cost overruns of the project; and (b) under
Loan 1697-CO:  (i) significant increases in the length of secondary water
network, sewage collectors and drainage to accelerate coverage of these
services in low-income areats; and (ii) reduction in the length of primary
distribution main, most trunk sewers and drainage canals which could be
deferred until pollution and flood control measures for the Bogota River
could be more fully studied and agreed; and (iii) acquisition and
installation of telemetry and communications equipment, needed to include
the Chingaza system, not originally planned. The revised program for the
above loan reflected a change in EAAB's priorities that had evolved since
project appraisal, in response to changes in urban growth patterns as well
as the financial constraints of EAAB.
Implementation Schedule
3.04     Under Loan 741-CO, EAAB faced major problems in the construction
of the Chingaza tunnel. The contractor, originally responsible for above
tunnel construction (1972), was unable to achieve a satisfactory work
progress.  The tunnel works were thus retendered and awarded to a second
contractor (1974). This contractor however encountered high concentrations
of methane gas during the excavation of the tunnel which led to explosions
on two occasions (1978 and 1981).   The gas created unsafe construction
conditions which resulted in long-term suspensions of the work while a
solution to the problem was being worked out.  The construction of the
tunnel -- and the overall project -- was not completed until June, 1983,
some six years behind appraisal estimates, as shown in Annex 4. There were
also operational problems in the following months due to rock failure in
the tunnel (para. 4.03).  The tunnel finally became operational in June
1985.   It appears in retrospect that the appraisal schedule for the
Chingaza scheme construction did not fully take into account the complexity
of tunnel construction in a difficult geological formation (mostly shale)
and other potentially more hazardous problems arising from methane gas
concentration during tunnel excavation.
3.05     Project implementation delays for Loan 1697-CO stemmed from BAAB's
preoccupation with the Chingaza tunnel construction problems (above para.)
and its shifting priorities with regard to accelerating service levels in
low income areas ("barrios marginalesn). Delays were also experienced with
the Bogota River Flood Control Study due to a lack of coordination between
EAAB and CAR. In 1982, EEEB which was to be involved in the study, pulled
out of the team citing that its participation was not warranted in light of
the nature of the study. It, however, agreed to abide by the recommenda-
tions of the study. Even though the design of the first phase of the Flood
Control Program was completed in 1985, additional studies would be needed
to ascertain more fully its benefits, identify the beneficiaries in the
light of anticipated urban development growth and thus to design an
effective cost recovery plan. Further efforts are also warranted to define



- 9 -
the relative role of various planning agencies, particularly CAR, in the
implementation of the flood control program.  The recommendations of the
Pollution Abatement Study, also completed in 1985, are currently under
review by EAAB before detailed engineering and cost recovery studies could
be undertaken.  Technical assistance has been provided under the Fourth
Bogota Project to undertake these studies.  Annex 5 provides a comparison
of actual and appraisal timeframes for the implementation of various
project components   under Loan 1697-CO.
3.06       Because the actual water demand was substantially below the
appraisal projections throughout the project period (see para. 4.02), major
water shortage problems (experienced in the 1950's and 1960's) were not
evidenced as a result of above-mentioned implementation delays under both
loans.   However, the deletion  of a major transmission  line  (Usaquen-
Parque-Nacional-Casablanca) from the original scope of the Second Bogota
Project -- stemming from EAAB's financial constraints -- meant further
delays in coping with the water shortage problems of the densely populated
southwest area of Bogota.  This problem is currently addressed under the
Fourth Bogota Project.
Procurement
3.07      Procurement was done in accordance with Bank's guidelines.  In
line with appraisal expectations, most contracts for civil works (except
for the Chingaza tunnel contract) pipes and consultant services were
awarded to local firms.   Most equipment  (water meters, construction,
maintenance, and communication equipment) were purchased from foreign
suppliers.  Because of the technical complexity of the Chingaza project,
several change-orders were issued during project execution. In the case of
Loan  1697-CO,  the  Bank  had  to  cancel  US$2.1  million  representing
misprocurement that resulted from two civil works contracts (Fucha canal
interceptor) not being awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder.
Project Costs
3.08      A detailed comparison of appraisal and actual project costs is
presented in Annexes 6 and 7, and summarized as follows:

1/ Contingencies included and prorated; interest during construction
excluded.
As noted from the above table, in the case of Loan 741-CO, there is a
significant difference between appraisal and actual project costs,
attributable mostly to delays in Chingaza tunnel construction (para. 3.04).
Actual costs expressed in local currency, however, are considerably
higher  than  appraisal  estimates  due  to  a  higher-than-anticipated
devaluation, coupled with higher levels of inflation. In the case of Loan
1697-CO, the actual project cost is 6% lower than the appraisal cost, due
primarily to an overall reduction in the provision of trunk sewers and
drainage works  (para.  3.03).   For both loans,  however,  there was a
significant increase in the consultant costs compared to the appraisal
estimates which was required by the unexpected revisions in the project
scope (para. 3.03) and the additional efforts needed to prepare follow-on
investment projects.
Disbursements
3.09     Allocation by category of the Bank loans (741-CO and 1697-C0) and
their cumulative disbursement schedules are presented in Annexes 8 and 9.
In general, disbursement lagged behind appraisal estimates, due mainly to
implementation delays (particularly for Loan 741-CO).   Loan 741-CO was
fully disbursed over a 10-year period (against the appraisal-projected
7-year period), from FY1972 to FY1981.  The loan closing date had to be
extended twice -- fror the original 12/31/77 to the final 12/31/80 -- to
accommodate construction delays of the Chingaza tunnel. In addition, cost
overruns warranted reduction of disbursement percentage for the Chingaza
civil works in October 1978.   Loan 1697-CO was disbursed over a 6-year
period (against the appraisal projected 4-year period), from FY1980 to
FY1986.  As with Loan 741-CO, the loan closing date was extended twice,
from 6/30/83 to 6/30/85, to accommodate the purchase of water meters
and maintenance equipment. Except for the cancellation of US$2.1 million
(para. 3.07), the loan was fully disbursed at the time of closing.
Reporting
3.10          Progress  reports,  received  on  a  quarterly  basis,  were
satisfactory.    Delays,  ranging  from  5  to  20  months  were,  however,



- 11 -
encountered in the submission of audits of EAAB's accounts. In the earlier
years of project implementation, EAAB had to be constantly reminded of the
audit backlogs.  This situation has, however, improved during the more
recent years.
Performance of Consultants. Contractors, and Suppliers
3.11     The performance of the project design and engineering consultants
was  overall  satisfactory.   The  technical  assistance  consultants  who
assisted EAAB with the assessment of pollution abatement and flood control
problems of the Bogota River, also performed satisfactorily.
3.12        Except in the case of one major civil work contract, the
performance of contractors and suppliers was satisfactory.  The exception
arose in the construction of the Chingaza tunnel where the original
contractor  (foreign)  could  not adequately  perform  due  to  management
problems, technical difficulties as well as a lack of communication with
EAAB, and a lack of familiarity with the working conditions in Colombia.
Faced with an extremely slow progress of the tunnel contract, since its
start in March 1972, EAAB had to cancel the contract aud rebid the
unfinished portion of the contract which was subsequently awarded to a new
contractor (also foreign). The second contractor had a good rapport with
EAAB's staff even though there were several instances of strained rela-
tionship between the contractor and EAAB concerning additional claims,
which in the opinion of EAAB were too many and unfair. The performance of
the second contractor was, however, overall satisfactory.  His progress
was, nevertheless, paralyzed on two occasions - in November 1978 and in
January  1981  -  following  methane  gas  explosion  in  the  difficult
Chuzza-Ventana heading  of  the  tunnel.   The  original Chingaza  tunnel
contractor sued EAAB for unsettled claims.   The dispute was eventually
settled through arbitration.
IV. OPERATING PERFORNAICE
4.0;      A comparison of the appraisal and actual operating performance
indicaters (volumes of water produced and sold, number of connections,
service level coverage, staffing, etc.) for both loans is presented in
Annex 10.
4.02      For the most part of the project period, the volume of water
actually sold represented only about 60 to 75% of the corresponding
appraisal estimates.  This situation resulted from the following two key
factors: (i) an overestimate of Bogota's overall population at appraisal,
based on an assumption of growth-rate in  excess of 5%.   The actual
Bogota population, as shown in Annex 10, was only about 84% of the
appraisal estimate at project completion and averaged at a 4% annual growth
rate for the overall project period 1971-85; and (ii) lower-than-projected
water consumption levels which were overly optimistic, particularly under



- 12 -
the Second Bogota Project.   Unit   oonsumption per month per connection
declined from 51 cubic meters in 1971 to 47 cubic meters in 1977 (as
against the appraisal assumption of 78 oubio meters under the Bogota II
project).  Unit consumption further declined to about 36 cubic meters in
1985 (as against the appraisal assumption of 49 cubic meters under the
Bogota III projeot).   This stealily declining consumption trend --at an
average of 2.3% annual rate-- refleoted primarily the faot that many of the
new consumers oonnected to the system were low-income families with
consumption below the system average.  Not enough information is readily
available to separate the effect of long run price elasticity on
constumption levels from the income effect. The above situation led to an
excess production capacity and to less revenues to EAAB than forecast at
appraisal. In terms of peroentage population served, however, EAAB was
able to aohieve a higher-than projected coverage in service levels - from
77% in 1971 to 96% in 1985 for water supply and from 72% to 89% for
*sewerage during the same period. Underutilization problems related to the
restricted transmission and distribution capacity of the oitywide network,
particularly in the East and Southwest arees of the oity, are currently
being addressed under the Fourth Bogota Water Project.
4.03       Unexpected problems emerged in the operation of the Chingaza
tunnel following its start in August, 1983. Sign of rook failure in the
pressure section (Chuza-Ventana) of the tunnel appeared in October 1983,
causing a steady reduction of the flow downstream.   Repair work was
initially delayed due to high methane concentrations and difficulties in
draining  the  tunnel7/.    The  tunnel  was  put  back  into  satisfaotory
operation in August 1986, after the repairs were completed (in the amount
of about US$10 million).
4.04     Unaccounted-for water (UFW) remained at acoeptable levels (22% to
27%) during the period 1971-77, (except for the year 1973 when the Tibito
II water scheme was started). UFW, however, exceeded 30% in the following
years and reached a high 40% in 1985 (when the Chingaza scheme became fully
operational).    Several  factors  --  such  as  increases  in main  breaks
resulting from an increase in operating pressure, under-registration of
meters, increase in illegal conneotions, and overestimated production,
etc. -- contributed to the above situation. Given the growth of marginal
areas served, where operating conditions are difficult and the anticipated
increase in water pressures, appraisal targets to reduce unaccounted-for
water to less than 30% were optimistic, without a forceful program to
reduce losses. The measures undertaken by EAAB in remedying the UFW problem
were inadequate due to lack of funds to support a systematic and forceful
program of leak detection. UFW control is a major objective of the ongoing
Fourth Bogota Project.
4.05     EAAB's achievement was noteworthy in the productivity increase of
its staff.  The ratio of staff per 1000 water accounts steadily declined
from 7.9 in 1971 to about 4.9 in 1985.  The above staffing level is one of
the lowest for similar water utilities in L&tin America.
7/ During the repair period, the Tibito scheme (built under Loan 536-CO)
was placed back into full production and the El Sapo treatment plant
(built under Loan 741-CO) was treating water from the Rio Blanco
diversion, downstream of the tunnel failure.   The shutd4wn, however,
affected electricity production.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01      EAAR had a weak financial performance in several years, but on
balance, achieved a fair degree of financial self-sufficiency under Loans
741-CO and 1697-CO.  EAAB's financial statements are presented in Annex
11*   A narrative  summary of TAAB's historical performance during the
project period is provided below.
5.02      EAAB's financial performance was satisfactory in 1971 when Loan
741-CO was appraised.  However, because of increasing projects costs and
inadequate tariff increases, EAAB's performance deteriorated in the
following years and remained weak until 1975.   As the pace of project
investments was accelerating, EAAB increased tariffs by 30% in 1975.
Moreover, EAAB introduced in 1976 monthly tariff increases of 3% which more
than compensated for inflation.   With these measures, EAAB maintained
a satisfactory financial performance through 1978.   EAAB's performance,
however, deteriorated markedly in 1979, following the appraisal of Loan
1697-CO, when the Government reduced the monthly tariff increases from 3%
to 1%. In 1980, EAAB implemented a tariff increase of about 40%, together
with a 2% monthly rate to adjust for inflation.  To meet the increasing
investment needs during 1980-83, EAAB obtained a US$20 million commercial
bank loan which however proved to be insufficient.  In 1983 (partly in
preparation for the Fourth Bogota project), EAAB overcame its liquidity
crisis by introducing a futher 25% tariff increase and a 1.5% monthly
adjustment, in addition to obtaining a US$25 million commercial bank loan.
EAAB's financial performance has been satisfactory ever since.
5.03       On balance, EAAB complied for the most part, with the rate of
return convenant of 9 to 10% under Loan 741-CO and 5 to 7% under Loan
1697.   EAAB's performance  regarding  the  collection  of arrears  from
government institutions was also good.  For the most part of the project
period, accounts receivable were less than 2 months old.  It should be
noted that by 1985, EAAB's ini'ial fixed assets had increased twenty-fold
and were efficiently managed.
Investment Financing
5.04     A comparison of the appraisal and actual financing plan for EAAB's
investment program during the project period is shown in Annex 11. Despite
its less-than projected revenues and substantial cost overruns, EAAB
managed to maintain an impressive 41% contribution to investment from
internal cash generation, compared to 53% projected at appraisal. The cash
shortfall experienced during the project period was made up by an increase
in the use of external loan funds from the appraisal projected 32% to about
42%. A summary of investment financing is shown as follows:

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01          EAAB's  organizational  structure  and  the  quality  of  its
professional staff were considered adequate during the appraisal of both
loans. Billing and collections were also well organized and the accounting
system was satisfactory.   The only major deficiencies, identified during
the appraisal of Loan 741-CO were in budgeting, budget control and
revaluation of fixed assets. Even though no specific technical assistance
programs for institutional strengthening were included under the loans,
Bank missions provided a useful assistance to EAAB in addressing problems
in the above areas. During the final years of project implementation, EAAB
began to out-row its management information and financial planning systems
due to a rapid expansion of the service area and the number of service
connections. This problem is currently addressed under the Fourth Bogota
Project-
6.02      There were sporadic periods of management instability and poli-
tical interference that affected EAAB's operations. This was particularly
the case during 1980-81 w1hen the key staff at the top and middle management
levels -- including the General Manager -- were replaced, following the
appraisal of Loan 1697-CO (several months passed before vacancies could be
filled).   In  1984, yet another new management team took over EAAB's
operations which has since provided stability and a high degree of
professionalism.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The Second Bogota Project was successful in providing a capacity
increase of about 12 m3/sec which together with the existing Tibito
scheme (capacity - about 13 m3/sec) could meet Bogota's water demand well
beyond 1990 (against the projected 1985).  Despite the slow absorption of
the capacity increase in the following years,  the project represented



- 15 -
the next logical step for expanding Bogota's water supply through diversion
of water from outside basins to Bogota. The Third Bogota Project sought to
expand the distribution of water supply and complementary sewerage services
in the low income 'barrios' of Bogota. By the end of 1985, the above two
projects benefitted an estimated additional population of about 2.3
million, of whom the major beneficiaries were the urban poor. Under both
projects, water and sewerage services were made affordable to the
low-income families through the adoption of a more equitable tariff
structure and easier payment terms for initial connection charges.   The
impact of the two projects would continue to increase as further
*;zoiplementary works are undertaken in the areas of sewage and drainage (as
p'..-aned under the Fourth Bogota Project, for example).
l.ternal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR)
7.02     At appraisal, the internal financial rate of return of the Second
Bogota Project was estimated at 14%, using revenues from consumer charges
as a proxy for the economic benefits of the project. Power benefits of the
Chingaza  soheme were  also  included  in the above  estimate.    Further
benefits,  such  as  those  related  to  public  health,  hygiene  and
enhanced property values, were not however quantifiable and hence not
included in the rate of return calculations.   The calculation of IRR at
project  completion  uses  the  same  appraisal  methodology  and  also
recognizes the complementary investments made under the subsequent Third
and Fourth Bogota Projects that utilize the production capacity of the
Chingaza Scheme. Since such an estimate has been already made as a part of
the economic justification of the Fourth Bogota Project, and since no major
deviation, either in the cost stream or in the benefit stream, has been
observed, the best indicative IRR estimate for the Second Bogota Project at
PCR stage, is about 8% as noted in the appraisal report of the Fourth
Bogota Project.8/ The lower than-projected estimate is primarily due to
the cost overrun of the Chingaza tunnel, the increased cost of major
transmission mains which were deferred to a later date, and a lower than
anticipated unit demand.   It is worth noting that the possibilities of
staging the Chingaza scheme were limited because of the minimum size
requirements of the conveyance tunnel (from a construction viewpoint).
8/ Staff Appraisal Report on Fourth Bogota Water Supply and Sewerage
Project, Report No. 5278-CO (February 28, 1985), see Annex 15,
Attachment 4, for a detailed IRR calculation.



- 16 -
7.03       Three IRR's were calculated during the appraisal of the Third
Bogota Project, one for the drainage component (21%), one for the combined
water and sewerage component (47%) and one for the overall project (37%).
't project completion, the IRR for the drainage component could not be
estimated as most of the primary drainage subcomponents were deleted from
the project scope. Using the same appraisal methodology, the estimated IRR
at project completion for the combined water and sewerage component (using
again revenues from consumer charges as proxy for economic benefits) is
about 36% (Annex 12). This high IRR yield results from the fact that large
benefits were attained with only minor investments in distribution mains
and networks built under the project.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01     The two projects were successful in expanding and improving water
supply in the low-income areas ("barrios marginales") of metropolitan
Bogota area.  Even though sewerage service levels were also improved, the
associated provisions of trunk mains and canalization of the city's major
drainage systems (except for Fucha Canal) had to be deleted from project
scope due to EAAB's financial constraints.   Some of the deferred capital
works of the two projects are, however, currently implemented under the
Fourth Bogota Project, aimed primarily to address the water distribution
restriction capacity in the East and Southwest areas of Bogota.
8.02       Implementation of the Chingaza scheme was fraught with serious
contractor problems, construction difficulties and a high cost overrun.
It appears, in retrospect, that project appraisal did not fully take into
account the technical complexity of the Chingaza scheme, which took about
11 years to complete, as against the originally estimated 6 years.
Implementation delays, also evidenced under the third project, were
attributable to a slow start-up, changes in EAAB management, and the
lingering financial constraiuts of EAAB.
8.03        The appraisal water demand projections were  over-optimistic
(para. 4.02). The declining consumption trend reflected for the most part
the fact that many of the new consumers connected to the system were
low-income families with consumption levels below the average.   A more
realistic water demand estimate could have led to the development of less
abundant but closer water sources to Bogota.



- 17 -
8.04         The Bank's relationship with EAAB was good throughout the
execution period. The Bank staff worked closely with the EAAB staff in the
resolution of problems, particularly on project implementation and
financial matters.   The only irritant to the Bank's otherwise amicable
relationship with EAAB was the inordinate delay in securing an interagency
coordination with CAR in the conduct of the Bogota River Flood Control
Study. Discussions are currently underway between EAAB and CAR with regard
to a timely implementation of the first phase of the Flood Control Program
once the issues of cost recovery and urban development are satisfactorily
resolved.   Concerning the Bogota River Pollution Abatement Program,  the
recommendation  of a  major  interceptor  paralleling  the River  --  for
trans,'ort of wastewater to a central treatment plant downstream -- is
currently under review by EAAB.
8.05      Lessons learned from the implementation of these projects were
applied in the preparation of the Fourth Bogota Project where a greater
care was given in estimating water demand and consumption levels, in
undertaking more detailed surveys for complex works (such as tunnels) prior
to the bidding stage, and in adopting a more realistic implementation
schedule.

BORROWER'S OPINION
(Translation)
Mr. Julio Linares
Financial Analyst
U Water Supply and Sewerage Division
Latin America and Caribbean Region
The World Bank
Washington, D. C., 20433
RE:  Loans 741-Co and 1697-Co
Bogota Water Supply Projects II and III
Projects Completion Report
Dear Mr. Linares:
We are sending this letter as a part of the final completion
report for above referenced loans.
a) Loan 741-CO
With this loan, EAAB carried out a project which, because of the
size (length) of the tunnels, the geology of the zone and the general
environment, is considered as one of the most difficult to execute in the
world.
The above-mentioned difficulties contributed to project delays.
The contract of the firm, Konstructor, of Yugoslavia, was rescinded because
of their inability to start the project.
The subsequent appointment of ICA, Mexico and the transfer of
equipment and machinery to this firm, permitted the resumption of works by
the beginning of 1976.
Many consulting and contracting firms as well as suppliers, both
local and foreign, participated in the project.   Their participation was
essential in competing this difficult project.
In this connection, I wish to emphasize the good collaboration of
the  World  Bank,  especially  the  officers  in  charge  of  the  project.
Unfortunately, the water distribution network was not developed on time to
carry the Chingaza water. This prevented the efficient utilization of the
project.

b) Loan 1697-CO
With this loan, EAAB reinforced its water distribution system and
developed an ambitions sewerage master plan. Moreover, EAAB reinforced its
inventory of operations and maintenance equipment and carried out the study
for the Bogota River improvements.
With the construction of the Rio Tunjuelo retention basin and the
improvements to Niza, Cordoba and Fucha canals, the health benefits of the
community, though difficult to quantify, have been significant.
The study and design of mains, substantially completed under the
project, is the basis of an ambitious expansion project which EAAB is
currently undertaking with Bank assistance (Bogota IV project assisted with
Loan 2512-CO).
A very select group of local and foreign consultants and
contractors participated in the studies and works. EAAB highly appreciates
their participation.
Under the project, EAAB also initiated a program of institutional
strengthening, particularly with regard to improvements in operation and
maintenance.
I with to emphasize the great assistance provided by EAAB's and
Bank staff for these projects, which permitted a successful completion.
Cordially yours,
Eduardo Robayo S.
