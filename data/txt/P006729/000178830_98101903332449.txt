APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a water supply project for
Bogota, the capital of Colombia, for which a Bank loan of US$88 million
equivalent is proposed. The borrower would be the Empresa de Acueducto y
Alcantarillado de Bogota (EAAB), an autonomous public enterprise owned by
the Municipality of the Distrito Especial de Bogota (Speciatl District) and
in charge of the Special District's water supply, sewerage and drainage
services.
ii.       In 1968 EAAB received a US$14 million Bank loan (536-CO) for the
First Bogota Water Supply Project, which has been proceeding very satisfac-
torily and is expected to be completed on schedule in 1972. Because of
some additions to the original program that have doubled (at a small addi-
tional cost) the capacity provided by the First Project, it: will cover de-
mand through 1976 instead of through 1973 as first planned..
iii.      Starting with the first loan for Bogota, the Bank has become
increasingly involved in the Colombian water supply and sewerage sector.
This is reflected in a loan for Cali (682-CO in 1970), the proposed loan
for Palmira, and loan requests for projects in various other medium-size
cities.
iv.       The proposed Project is the second stage of EAAB's long-range
water supply master plan and comprises the first phase of ithe Chingaza
water diversion scheme, additions to the Bogota water distribution system,
the supply of equipment, and engineering services. The major elements of
the Project are: (a) a dam on the Chuza river in the Chingaza area, a
previously almost inaccessible mountain range east of Bogota; and (b) a
39-km conveyance system, consisting of 33 km of tunnels and 6 km of pipe-
lines, from the dam to the city. The exceptional length of these tunnels
determines the six-year project construction period (1971-1976).
V.        The diversion of water to Bogota will increase considerably the
hydroelectric power generation potential of the Bogota River since its
average flow will nearly double after full development of the Chingaza
scheme. The present flow is utilized by the Empresa de En,ergia Electrica
de Bogota (EEEB) in its 550-MW power generation system, developed since
1960 with substantial Bank assistance. Because of these iimportant power
benefits, EEEB has agreed to make a financial contribution to the Project.
Studies are under way to analyze the implications of the Chingaza water
diversion on the Colombian power generation program.
vi.       EAAB's water supply master plan is closely coordinated with its
sewerage and drainage master plan, started in 1965.  The objectives of these
master plans are to (a) eliminate the deficiencies in water supply, sewerage



- ii -
and drainage services, which had not kept pace with the rapid growth of Bo-
gota (b) assure, in adequate stages, additional water supply capacity to
keep ahead of the increasing demand; and (c) provide a basic water distribu-
tion, sewerage and drainage grid in undeveloped areas of the Special District
which would help to guide future growth in accordance with Bogota's urban de-
velopment plan. As Executing Agency for the current UNDP Urban Transport and
Development Study for Bogota, the Bank is helping the national and local au-
thorities to coordinate planning and prepare high-priority urban projects.
vii.      The Project is needed to prevent a water supply deficit in Bogota
after 1976, and is the least-cost alternative for the next supply scheme
after the First Project. The internal financial rate of return is expected
to be 14% for the water supply and sewerage program of which the proposed
Project is the main element.
viii.     The total estimated cost of the Project is US$118 million, includ-
ing interest during construction on the Bank loan. The proposed Bank loan
of US$88 million would cover (i) the full estimated foreign exchange cost
of all civil works and equipment supply contracts, including contingencies,
of US$70.6 million, (ii) US$3.1 million of the cost of engineering, repre-
senting about 50% of the total engineering cost, and (iii) interest during
construction on the Bank loan, of US$14.3 million.
ix.       EAAB's total construction expenditures during the period over
which the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed (1971-1977) are estimated
at Col$5.3 billion (US$228 million). These expenditures would be financed
by internal resources (49%), the proposed Bank loan (39%), the undisbursed
portion of Loan 536-CO and the joint loans for the First Project (4%),
EEEB's contribution (5%) and local borrowing (3%). Thus, although the pro-
posed Bank loan would cover 85% of the cost of the Project (excluding in-
terest during construction), a major portion of EAAB's total construction ex-
penditures would be covered from its own cash generation and other local
sources.
x.        Except for minor works, procurement for all civil works and equip-
ment supply contracts under the Project would be on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding. Local equipment manufacturers would be given a
15% preference in comparing their bids with bids from foreign manufacturers.
xi.       EAAB has made considerable progress since 1968 in iniproving its
operations and organization, and further improvements are expected under
the proposed loan. Performance of the present management has been good,
the financial position is sound, and earnings have been satisfactory with
rates of return of 9% to 10% on the revalued rate base. The financing plan
is acceptable and future earnings are expected to be satisfactory, with
rates of return of 9% to 12% during construction, 7% in the first year of
operation, and 8% or more thereafter.
xii.      The Project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$88 million
equivalent to EAAB for a term of 30 years, including 7 years of grace.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota (EAAB), the
autonomous water and sewerage public enterprise owned by the Municipality
of the Distrito Especial de Bogota (Special District), has applied for a
Bank loan to help finance its Second Water Supply Project.
1.02      EAAB received a US$14 million Bank loan (536-CO) in 1968 1/ to
help finance its First Water Supply Project; joint loans f'or this project
were made to EAAB by the US Export Import Bank (US Eximbank) and by the
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau of Germany, for US$4 million and DM2.4
million, respectively.  EAAB's performance under Loan 536-CO has been good
and it has made remarkable progress in improving its operations.
1.03      The First Project (Tibito-II scheme) will increase the capacity
of Bogota's water supply system by 150% (from 5.5 m3/sec to 13.5 m3/sec),
sufficient to eliminate the present supply deficit and keep ahead of demand
through 1976. This capacity increase is twice as large ast was expected at
the time of project appraisal because small additions to the catchment works
(partial regulation and diversion of the nearby Teusaca RiLver) will assure
a higher average raw water yield at Tibito and will permit the scheme to be
operated almost continuously at its peak capacity. These additions to the
First Project account for some of the cost increase from Col$310 million
and US$17.3 million to Col$525 million and US$18.5 millioni, an increase of
70% and 7%, respectively. Most of the First Project's cost increase was
caused by additional distribution works and local engineering services, as
well as the higher-than-estimated cost of preparatory wor]ks for the Second
Project (technical investigations, access roads). Nevertlheless, due to the
large capacity increase resulting from the low cost additions to the First
Project, Tibito-II has become even more attractive than originally assumed
and has allowed EAAB to postpone the next supply increment from 1974 to
1976 (Annex 1 and Map 2).
1.04      Implementation of the First Project is well advanced:  75% of the
originally programmed works was completed by 1970 and most of them will be
commissioned by September 1971; completion of the full expanded project is
scheduled for 1972, within the original closing date (June 30, 1972).
1.05      With completion of the expanded Tibito-lI scheme, all water resour-
ces in the Bogota river basin upstream of Bogota city will have been fully
developed for water supply purposes, to the extent this is economically just-
ified at this time. The next supply scheme will therefore require diversion
of water from outside basins to Bogota. This is the objective of the Chin-
gaza scheme, of which the first stage (Chingaza-I) is the main element of
the proposed Project.

This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission in October
z,ti.l Dezenmber 1970, composed of Messrs. J. Krombach and E. Wessels.  The pow-
-r ispects of the Project were reviewed by Messrs. E. Friedmann and M. Isla
ol '.  Bank.  A feasibility study for the Project was prepared by Ingetec
LH iA.  a Colombian consulting firm, in cooperation with foreign experts.
II. THE ECONOMY
A.  Basic Data
>101      Colombia, occupying an area of some 1.15 million km2, has a
popullation of 22 million. The population growth rate over the past two
deailes has been 3.3%, one of the highest in Latin America, which averaged
'.9G Due to rural migration, the country's urban growth has been twice
that rate (5% to 8%).
2.02      Annual growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) has increased
fronu ;iround 5% in the early 1960's to 7% by the end of the decade. The
GDP Was Col$96 billion in 1968 (US$300 per capita), of which 31% was con-
tributed by agriculture and 17% by manufacturing industry. A severe
constraint on the growth of the economy has been imposed by cyclical
swings in the capacity to import caused by fluctuating world market prices
for coffee, Colombia's major export commodity. To reduce this dependence
on coffee, other exports are being promoted and have shown an impressive
growth from US$100 million in 1964 to US$240 million in 1969 (compared
with US$350 million of coffee exports in 1968/69).
B. Urban Development
2.03      At present, urban population is about 57% of the total, compared
with less than 40% in 1960.  The government's urban development policy,
set out in its 1970-1973 Economic and Social Development Plan, is intended
to induce some reasonable balance in the growth rate of the various regions
and cities. The long-term objective is to reduce the rate of migration to
the large cities, including Bogota, by fostering the growth of the medium
and smaller cities.
III. THE SECTOR
A. Organization
3.01      The Colombian water supply and sewerage sector comprises three
major groups:
(i)  The larger cities (population above 50,000), of which 21 have
organized their own municipal Empresas (public enterprises)
to provide public services. These, especially the larger ones,
are generally well run. Bogota has separate Empresas for water
supply and sewerage (EAAB), power, telephones and public trans-
port.



(ii)  The smaller cities (population between 2,500 and 50,000), of
which 750 have water supply and sewerage systems tnder the con-
trol of the Instituto Nacional de Fomento Municipal (INSFOPAL),
a unit of the Ministry of Health. These systems are run on a
regional cooperative basis and have required substantial finan-
cial support from the government. Their administrative compe-
tence is usually poor.
(iii)  The rural communities (population below 2,500) where the Instituto
Nacional Para Programas Especiales de Salud (INPES), another unit
of the Ministry of Health, has embarked on a program to improve
the poor sanitary conditions.
3.02      National agencies with important functions in the sector are:
The Fondo Nacional de Proyectos de Desarollo (FONADE), for Einancing and
administration of feasibility studies; the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje
(SENA), for vocational training; and the Asociacion Colombiana de Acueductos
y Alcantarillados (ACODAL), an association of sanitary engineers.
B. Investment Program
3.03      The relative importance of the three groups in th,e sector, and the
sector investment program and financing plan are shown in the government's
1970-73 Plan (see paragraph 2.03) as follows:

3.04      Government budgetary assistance will concentrate on the smaller
and rural systems.  Services in the larger cities are expected to become
gradually self-supporting because their per-capita costs for system improve-
ments are generally below those of the smaller communities, while higher
per-capita income permits the charging of adequate tariffs. These cities
also offer the best hope for institutional improvements in the short term.



C.  Role of Bank and Other Foreign Lenders
3.05      Starting in 1965, the Bank has become increasingly involved in the
Colombian water supply and sewerage sector as a whole. So far, it has made
two loans totalling US$32.5 million, for Bogota (536-CO) and Call (682-CO).
Besides the current loan proposals for Bogota and Palmira, it is expected
that loan requests for projects in a group of several other medium cities
will soon be processed. The Bank's knowledge of the sector has been enhanced
through the sector review included in the 1970 preinvestment survey for Coloui-
bia (Report Number WH-200a, dated November 1, 1970).
3.06      Other foreign lending agencies that have provided financing to the
sector are the Inter-American Development Bank (9 loans totalling US$43 mil-
lion), US-AID, US Eximbank and the German Kreditanstalt.
IV. BOGOTA AND ITS PRESENT WATER SUPPLY,
SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES
A. Background
4.01      Bogota is the capital of Colombia and its main administrative,
industrial, commercial and educational center. The city's present 2.5
million population represents 12% of the total population of Colombia and
46% of that of the four largest cities (the others are Medellin - 1.4
million, Cali - 1.0 million, and Barranquilla - 0.7 million). It has one
of the country's highest urban population growth rates (close to 7% per
year) and rural migration to the city has been higher than in any other
region. As Executing Agency for the current UNDP Transport and Urban
Development Study for Bogota, the Bank is helping the national and local
authorities to coordinate planning and prepare high-priority urban proj-
ects.
4.02      Bogota is situated on a plain, known as Sabana de Bogota, at an
altitude of 2,600 m. This accounts for its natural attractions -- such as
the cool climate, absence of tropical diseases (which exist in many other
parts of the country) and ample space for expansion. Another important fea-
ture is the availability of abundant and favorably located water resources
for water supply and power generation purposes. All these attractions make
it doubtful whether migration ta Bogota can be reduced substantially. But
even if its growth rate would gradually decline, the city's population along
with the demand for public services will continue to grow rapidly at least
over the next decade. Except for the adequate power supply, achieved with
substantial Bank assistance, there are still large deficiencies in public
services.
B. Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage
4.03      At present, 95% of Bogota's population is served by the EAAB water
distribution system (totalling 3,000 km) through 225,000 house connections
and 400 public stand-pipes (supplying about 200,000 people); the remaining 5%



- 5 -
depend on small local systems, water-ULuk t.rucks or tndlvidtial nupp lI.'
The EAAB sewerage system (1,500 km of sewers and sewage interceptors) and
drainage system (60 km of large drainage channels) serve 80% of the popula-
tion; most of the remaining 20% have septic tanks, leavini only a very small
portion of the population with no sewage disposal facilities.
4.04       The EAAB systems do not extend at present beyoncl the limits of the
Sanitary District of Bogota, representing the urbanized 20),000 ha of the
Special District. With high mountains to the south (where the remaining
160,000 ha of the Special District extend) and east, the city can grow only
toward the west and north into areas of the Sabana outside the Special Di-
strict, where the Corporacion Autonoma Regional de la Sabana (CAR), a nation-
al agency, is in charge of planning and providing infrastructure. EAAB and
CiR have begun to examine the possibilities of supplying water from the EAAB
system to those communities in the future "Bogota MetropoLitan Area" where
alternative individual schemes are either not available or too expensive.
4.05       Bogota's water supply system is based entirely on surface water
catchments from the Bogota River and its tributaries. The system was de-
veloped over the past 75 years, starting with the catchment of small
streams flowing through the city, followed in 1938 by the Tunjuelo River
gravity scheme and in 1959 by the first Bogota River pumpiLng scheme
(Tibito-I). Although there is some groundwater in the Sabana, the qual-
ity is poor and the quantity barely sufficient to supply a few small com-
munities and to be used for some irrigation in the Sabana.
4.06       Except for a short period after 1959, Bogota has suffered from a
continuous supply deficit since 1950. The two expansions of the Tibito-I
scheme (in 1965 and in 1969, the latter under the emergency phase of the
First Project) have only temporarily reduced this deficit. With a total
supply capacity of 6.5 m3/sec and an estimated demand of 8.1 m3/sec, the
supply deficit by the end of 1970 was 24%; compounded by insufficient dis-
tribution capacity, it has affected 65% of the population (55% by low
pressures and 10% by discontinuous supplies).
4.07       The supply deficit will be eliminated as the three major phases
of the First Project are completed: the pipeline in mid-1971, and the
expanded treatment and pumping works and the Bajo Teusaca works in 1972
(paragraph 1.03). Some deficiencies in the water service are likely to
continue through 1974, however, because the distribution system can be
rehabilitated and expanded only gradually (Annex 8). EAAB's existing
systems and the First Project are shown on Maps 1 and 2; details are in
Annex 1.

V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The proposed Project is the second stage of the long-range Bogota
water supply master plan developed in 1966-1968 in preparation of the First
Bogota Water Supply Project. Its main feature is the diversion of water
from the Chingaza area, a previously almost inaccessible mountain range
40 km east of Bogota city, through a series of tunnels and pipeline sections
to the city. The long construction period for these tunnels determines the
timetable for the entire Project, which has to be completed by 1977 to
prevent a new supply deficit. Of the total estimated yield of 20 m3/sec,
which could be diverted by gravity from the Chingaza area, the Project
(Chiugaza-I) would develop at least the first 7.5 m3/sec and possibly up
to 12 m3/sec (Maps 1 and 2, Annex 3).
5.02      Because the 39-km conveyance system cannot be staged, capital
xequirements for this initial stage are high, but operating costs will be
considerably lower than those of the existing schemes as no pumping (gravity
transmission) and very little treatment (excellent raw water quality) are
required. The Chingaza scheme will therefore be operated to provide the
future base load for Bogota's water supply.
5.03      The diversion of water to the Bogota River will substantially
increase its hydroelectric power potential. This will permit additional
power generation in the existing plants of Empresa de Energia Electrica de
Bogota (EEEB) on the Bogota River and might justify, particularly after
-ompletion of future stages of the Chingaza scheme, installation of subs-
tantial additional power generating capacity in the Bogota basin (Map 1,
paragraphs 5.20-5.22, and Annex 2).
A. Description
5.04      The Project consists of:  (i) engineering for, and construction
of, the first stage of the Chingaza Water Diversion Scheme and related dis-
tribution works; (ii) provision of equipment; and (iii) engineering studies
for future schemes in EAAB's systems. Its principal elements are as fol-
lows (for details see Annex 4):
(i) Chingaza Scheme
(a) a dam on the Chuza River, above its confluence with the
Guatiquia River; to create a reservoir of about 200 mil-
lion m3;
(b) a water conveyance system between the Chuza reservoir
and Bogota, including about 33 km of tunnels with sev-
eral vertical intake shafts (for en-route catchments
in the Rio Blanco area) and about 6 km of pipelines;



- 7 -
(c)  the first stage of a water treatment plant with a ca-
pacity of up to 13 m3/sec.;
(d)  about 35 km of access roads (in addition to the 76 km
constructed under the First Project); and
(e)  expansion and rehabilitation of the water ,distribution
system, including the installation of about 20 km of
large-diameter and about 100 km of medium-diameter
pipes, storage tanks with a combined capacity of about
200,000 m3, and booster pumping stations.
(ii) Provision of Equipment
(a) Operational, engineering and maintenance equipment, in-
cluding water meters, maintenance vehicles, and commu-
nications equipment, required by the expansion of EAAB's
operations under the Project.
(iii) Studies for Future Schemes
(a)  Engineering studies for future water supply, sewerage,
drainage and flood control schemes in the Bogota metro-
politan area; and
(b)  Studies of pollution control through treatment of
sewage discharged by EAAB's sewerage system.
5.05      Subject to the satisfactory outcome of a special feasibility study
on advancing certain works of the second stage of the Chingaza Scheme, it
could be justified to include in the Project the run-of-the-river diversion
from the Guatiquia River (a 3.5 km tunnel from the Guatiquia River to the
Chuza reservoir, and related intake works). The earliest date at which such
a proposal could be considered would be after receipt and evaluation of al-
ternative bids for the tunnel works (with and without the Guatiquia tunnel),
scheduled for September 1971, and a final decision may have to be postponed
until construction of the Chuza-to-Bogota conveyance system is sufficiently
advanced to confirm its actual cost and the availability of funds for addi-
tional works.

AMOUNT TO BE FINANCED BY
PROPOSED BANK LOAN                                 2.0  86.0  88.0
5.07      The cost estimates were prepared by Ingetec and EAAB.  Except for
the dam and tunnels, they are based on current cost data of the First Project.
For the dam, comparable cost data were available from several recent Colombian
projects, especially the Bank-financed Chivor hydroelectric project (Loan
681-CO).



5.08      Special attention was given to estimating the tuinel cost, by far
the largest and most critical item of the Project. The adopted cost estimates
appear reasonable: they take into account available experLence from tunnel
projects in Colombia and other countries and are about 10% above the
estimates prepared by Jacobs A-ssociates, a U.S. consulting firm, in an
independent cost study.  llowever, because of the special characteristics
of the Chingaza tunnels (exceptional length, small diameter, difficult access,
high altitudes), there remains a more than usual uncertainty on the actual
cost of these tunnels, which is reflected in the higher contingencies provided
for this item. The cost estimates do not include the Guatiquia tunnel (esti-
mated to cost US$2.5 million), becauise this tunnel would only be included in
the Project, if the advancement of its construction can be shown to be eco-
nomically justified and financially feasible.
5.09      Physical contingencies include 30% for the tunnels and 20% for
all other works. This is considered sufficient to absorb possible cost
increases due to higher-than-expected basic bid prices and to any addi-
tional works required during execution of these contracts. Price contin-
gencies have been calculated assuming total cost increases of 3% per year
on the foreign (expressed in US$) and of 8% per year on thie local (expressed
in Col$) costs. These assumptions are supported by experience with cost
increases on similar civil works projects in Colombia over the past few
years.
5.10      The estimated foreign cost portions of the civil works elements
(72%-78% for the major civil works and 40%-55% for the others) take into
account that Colombia is a net importer of fuel, cement, structural steel
and other important construction materials. The higher percentage for the
major civil works (dam and tunnels) reflects the special characteristics of
these works, which will require highly mechanized construction methods.
C.   Construction Schedule
5.11      The construction schedule for the Project is shonm in Annex 6.
The long construction period of six years (1971-1976), including bidding
and mobilization, is due to the estimated time required to construct the
28 km main tunnel (Palacio-Rio Blanco). Construction of ithe other ele-
ments of the Chingaza scheme (dam, short tunnels, pipelines, treatment
plant) requires only two to three years and is therefore scheduled for
the latter part of the 1971-1976 period. Access roads into the Chingaza
area and distribution works under the proposed Project ar,e a continuation
of those being constructed under the First Project, and will start after
that project's completion in 1972.
D.   Amount of Proposed Loan
5.12      A loan of US$88 million is proposed to finance (i) the full esti-
mated foreign exchange cost of all civil works and equipment supply contracts,
including contingencies, of US$70.6 million, (ii) US$3.1 million of the
cost of engineering, representing about 50% of the total engineering cost
and (iii) interest during construction on the Bank loan, of US$14.3 million.



- 10 -
The provision under (ii) would ensure that the amount of Bank financing for
engineering would not be affected by the proportion in which consultants
contracts are placed among local and foreign firms and would be consistent
with the practice adopted in other recent Bank loans, to avoid discrimina-
tion against Colombian consulting firms.
E.   Procurement
5,13      Except for minor works (civil works of US$50,000 or less and equip-
ment supplies of US$5,000 or less), procurement for all civil works and equip-
ment supply contracts under the Project would be on the basis of internation-
al competitive bidding. For the purpose of evaluating bids, a 15% preference
will be allowed for equipment manufactured in Colombia. This is not expected
to substantially change the distribution of equipment supply contracts among
local and foreign firms and its effect, if any, will probably be limited to a
few items, such as certain electrical equipment and water meters. In any
case, with equipment representing only 13% of the estimated Project cost, the
effect of such preference on the Project cost will be negligible.
5.14      The contracts for construction of the Chuza dam and of the main
tunnel cannot be divided and no local contractor is large enough to compete
successfully for these contracts, except in a joint venture with a major
foreign firm. In the bidding for the main tunnel contract, which has start-
ed on March 2, 1971, construction of the two shorter tunnels has been includ-
ed as an option (a further option in this bidding is the inclusion of the
Guatiquia tunnel; see paragraph 5.05). A final decision on the scope of this
contract will be taken when bids have been evaluated (bid opening scheduled
for early July 1971). None of the other civil works contracts (construction
of treatment plant, storage tanks, and access roads, and pipe installation)
is likely to attract foreign firms and it is assumed that they will be carried,
out by local firms.
F.   Disbursement
5.15      It is proposed to disburse the Bank loan against the estimated
foreign exchange requirements of the Project, using as a basis for dis-
bursement the following cost percentages:
Civil Works
(i)  100% of the downpayment on the main tunnel contract;
(ii)   74% of the contracts for construction of the dam and
of the conveyance system (except for the downpay-
ment on the main tunnel contract covered under
());
(liM)   50% of tlhe contracts for construction of the treatment
plant and for distribution works; and
(iv)   40W  of thie contracts for construction of the access
roads;



- 1 1 -
Equipment Supply
(v) 100% of the CIF cost of all direct imports;
Consultant.s Services
(vi)   50% of all contracts with local and foreign consultants
(up to a total amount of US$3.1 million);
Interest on Bank Loan
(vii) 100% of the interest and other charges accruing during
the Project construction period.
5.16      Details of the proposed allocation of the proceeds from the loan
are in Annex 5 and quarterly disbursements forecasts in Annex 7.
G.   Administration
5.17      EAAB's Construction Department would be responsible for the
design work and supervision of construction, to be carried out by con-
sultants or EAAB staff. Performance of the Construction 'Department
under the First Project has been good. As in the First Project, local
consultants, some in joint venture with foreign firms, will carry out
the design work and supervision of construction for the major Project
elements (dam, conveyance system, treatment plant). EAAB staff would be
directly in charge of the other elements (access road construction, dis-
tribution pipe installation, etc.).
5.18      The following engineering services for the Project have already
been contracted, in consultation with the Bank, under the First Project:
(i) design and preparation of specifications for the Chuza-Bogota convey-
ance system (tunnels and aqueducts), by Ingetec (paragraph 1.06); (ii)
investigations and preliminary engineering for the treatment plant, by a
joint venture of Engineering Science International, a U.S. firm, and Sal-
gado, Piedrahita & Escallon, a Colombian firm. The foreiLgn cost portion
of expenditures under these contracts through 1971 is financed under Loan
536-CO and the joint loan from the US Eximbank. Engineering services still
to be contracted are: (Mi) construction supervision of the conveyance
system and the dam; (iv) design of the dam, for which Ingetec has done the
preliminary engineering; and (v) final design and construction supervision
of the treatment plant. The most urgent of these pending engineering
services, supervision of the tunnel construction, is expected to be con-
tracted before July 1971; the others are scheduled to be contracted not
later than December 1971.
5.19      Agreement was reached during negotiations with EAAB that (i) con-
sultants for the pending engineering services for the Project would not be
contracted without the Bank's prior concurrence and (ii) the Bank would be
given an opportunity to comment on all other important aspects related to
engineering for the Project and for the other elements of EAAB's program



- 12 -
during Project construction (design criteria, specifications, construction
programming, etc.).
H.   Power Aspects
5.20      As indicated in paragraph 5.03, the Project has important power
implications because the water diversion from Chingaza increases the hydro-
electric power generation potential of the Bogota River downstream of
Bogota city. This will permit additional power generation in EEEB's exist-
ing hydroelectric plants on the Bogota River (total installed capacity 550
MW), constructed with substantial Bank assistance since 1960 (Loans 246,
313 and 537-CO totalling US$85 million) and could justify the future instal-
lation of additional power generating capacity in the Bogota basin. Thus,
the Project would be the first step of a coordinated water resources devel-
opment plan in the Bogota region for water supply and power generation pur-
poses. This plan envisages at least two other major diversion schemes
(Sumapaz with 30 m3/sec and Suarez with 10 m3/sec) to be developed after
Chingaza, which will further increase the power generation potential of the
Bogota River (Annex 2).
5.21      The Colombian power entities, particularly EEEB and Interconexion
Electrica S. A. (ISA), have fully recognized the important power implica-
tions and benefits of these diversion schemes. EEEB and ISA have started,
in cooperation with the National Planning Department, a joint analysis of
the possible new hydroelectric developments in the Bogota basin, as part
of the power generation program for ISA's interconnected system. 1/
5.22      On the basis of a preliminary study by EAAB, EEEB and Ingetec to
determine the present worth of benefits resulting from additional power
generation in EEEB's existing plants with water from Chingaza (for details
see Annex 9), EEEB has agreed to make a contribution of Col$ 280 million
to the financing of the Project (see paragraph 8.14 and Annex 15, page 7).
I.   Ecology
5.23      The Project is not expected to have any adverse ecological ef-
fects on the Guatiquia basin, where water will be impounded and diverted,
or on the Bogota basin, which will receive additional water.
5.24      Guatiquia Basin.  The diversion of up to 20 m3/sec will have
a small effect on the Guatiquia River and a negligible effect on the river
basins of which it is a tributary (Meta). The area to be submerged by the
Chuza and Chingaza reservoirs (and possibly a third reservoir) is not in-
habited nor used for any agricultural or forest purposes. Because of its
1/   ISA's interconnected system will include, besides ISA's own transmis-
sion network and power plants, the systems of Bogota (EEEB), Medellin
(EPM), Manizales (CHEC/ICEL), Cali (CVC/CHIDRAL) and the Northeast.
ISA's interconnection network and first power plant (Chivor) are pre-
sently under construction with Bank financing (Loans 575-CO and 681-CO).

tial for such uses. At these high altitudes, plant growtlh Is extremiely .ilw
and the thin grass cover must be protected from erosion, which would cause
more rapid siltage of the reservoir and affect the excellent raw water qual-
ity.
5.25      Bogota Basin.  Although the average flow of the Bogota River down-
stream of Bogota would be almost doubled after full development of the Chin-
gaza scheme, the additional 20 m3/sec represent an increase of only 25% of
the normal "winter flows" and are negligible in comparison with the recorded
or potential floods of the river (10-year flood 700 m3/sec, 50-year flood
1,000 m3/sec). On the other hand, because of EEEB's water diversion for pow-
er generation, the natural river bed in the first 25 km of the section down-
stream of Bogota (including the touristically attractive Tequendama Falls)
is almost dry during long periods of the year.
5.26      As would be true for any scheme for increasing Bogota's water
supply, the water diverted by the Project will be transformed into sewage
and increase pollution of the Bogota River unless sewage treatment plants
are built. However, the Project has the important advantage of temporarily
reducing river pollution because less water will be taken from the Bogota
River at Tibito (paragraph 5.02), thus assuring a higher flow of unused
water in the river. This might permit temporary deferment of sewage treat-
ment works.
5.27      Studies and pilot plant operations to determine the most feasible
alternative for the treatment of Bogota's sewage have been under way for
several years.  The timing for actually constructing sewage treatment facil-
ities will depend largely on (i) the pattern and timing of urban develop-
ment in the areas adjacent to the river in the Sabana, and (ii) the quality
standards for the river section downstream of Bogota, which have to be estab-
lished by CAR. During negotiations, EAAB agreed to undertake, as part of the
Project, studies of pollution control through treatment of sewage discharged
by its sewerage system into the Bogota river and to consult with the Bank upon
completion of these studies on the resulting recommendations and on their im-
plementation.
5.28      Cooperation between EAAB and CAR in determining the requirements
of pollution control near and downstream of Bogota city, and of pollution
prevention upstream of the Tibito water treatment plant, has been good.
For example, based on CAR's recommendation supported by ]EAAB and the Bank,
the government recently decided to relocate a steel mill project, a poten-
tial major water polluter, which had been planned immediately upstream of
the Tibito water intake.
J.   Sewerage, Drainage, Flood Control and Urban Development
5.29      EAAB's sewerage and drainage master plan, under construction since
1965, will provide a new system of large open-drainage channels with paral-
lel sewage interceptors in the Sanitary District of Bogota (paragraph 4.04).



- 14 -
i.xpenditures during 1971-1977 are expected to total Col$ 713 million. In
conjunction with the program for installation of a basic water distribution
grid under the First and proposed Second Water Supply Projects, this will
permit full development of all areas within the Sanitary District under ade-
(luate conditions. The water distribution program under the proposed Project
is flexible and can be adjusted to any future growth pattern of the city.
5.30      Any development beyond the Sanitary District would require substan-
tial additional investments for sewage, drainage and flood control works not
included in the current master plan (Map 2). Some of these investments are
likely to be needed before 1977, hence EAAB's investment program includes
a reasonable provision of Col$ 400 million for these additional works.
5.31      A major expansion of the city toward the west (defined as the most
feasible alternative in the recently completed Phase I of the UNDP study)
will require regulation of the Bogota River along a 40-km section upstream
of Alicachin (straightening the course and deepening the bed of the river),
because under the present conditions large areas are frequently flooded.
The river regulation project will presumably be carried out by CAR (most
of the project area is located outside the Special District), but EAAB and
the Mtnicipality are expected to participate in the preparation, and may
have to contribute to the financing, of this project.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
A.   Demand Forecasts and Investment Objectives
6.01      The main characteristics of Bogota and its present water supply
situation are described in paragraphs 4.01 through 4.06. Water demand is
expected to grow 9% per year -- from 8 m3/sec (255 Mm3) in 1970 to 14 m3/sec
(460 Mm3) in 1977, the year the Project would be completed, and to 21 m3/
sec in 1982, the year the next increment of investment would be required.
These forecasts assume no noticeable changes in the historic annual growth
rates of population (6% - 7%), and per-capita consumption (2%) through
1980 (Annex 8). The population assumption, according to which Bogota's
1977 population would be 3.9 million, has been supported by several inde-
pendent studies including the current UNDP/IBRD Transport and Urban Devel-
opment Study. The per-capita consumption assumption is reasonable.
6.02      With these demand forecasts, the capacity increase provided un-
der the First Project would be absorbed by 1976. To prevent a new supply
deficit, EAAB and the Municipality are planning to have the proposed Proj-
ect completed by the end of 1976. It would cover the increase in water
demand from 1977 through 1982 (assuming an initial diversion of 7.5 m3/sec
by the Chingaza scheme) and possibly through 1985 (assuming a diversion of
12 m3/sec, which would be achieved by adding the Guatiqufa tunnel; nt:u
i aragrdphs 5.05 and 5.08). Details of the demand forecast and of the pro-
gram for introducing future supply schemes are shown in Annex 8.



- 15 -
B.   Selection of Proposed Project
6.03      The long-range water supply master plan identified three major
future schemes (Chingaza, Sumapaz and Suarez), which could cover demand
for water in Bogota through the year 2,000.  The Chingaza scheme is the
most economical solution because its sources are relatively, close to Bogota
(40 km), it has very attractive technical features (no pumpling, little
treatment, availability of good reservoir sites), and there! are no competi-
tive water and land uses (Annex 2 and Map 1).
6.04      The particular design for water diversion from the Chingaza area
(tunnel conveyance system) and the proposed staged development up to the
full potential yield of 22 m3/sec are the least-cost solutions at discount
rates of up to 20%. The possibilities for staging were limited because
only the 6-km pipeline sections (two parallel pipes) of the 39-km convey-
ance system could be staged and because the selected tunnel diameter
(3.6 m) is the minimum feasible for construction (Annex 3).
C.   Internal Financial Return
6.05      The internal financial rate of return for development of the
Chingaza scheme up to a capacity of 12 m3/sec is 14%. It was computed as
the discount rate equalizing the present values of the net benefits attrib-
utable to the scheme and its capital costs. This return is less than the
full economic return, which includes benefits that are at present unquanti-
flable such as public health, general improvement of the urban environment,
and temporary reduction of river pollution (to the extent ithat these benefits
are not included already in the charges for water and sewerage). Also
excluded are benefits for which adequate information is nort available, such
as increased reliability of water supply and related savings in building
costs (no further need for roof tanks and individual booster pumping facil-
ities, except in high-rise buildings), irrigation benefits for farm land
in the Sabana, and power benefits resulting from possible new hydroelectric
developments in the Bogota River basin. Annex 9 gives details on the cal-
culation of the internal financial return. The rate of return was found
to be relatively insensitive to higher operating costs or :shortened physical
life. A rate of return in excess of 12% would be achieved even if demand
should be 20% below forecast, or if capital costs increase by 20%.
VII. THE BORROWER
A.   Organization and Management
7.01      EAAB, the proposed borrower, is an autonomous public enterprise
owned by the Municipality of the Special District. It was organized in
1955 under a decree of the Municipal Council, and is in charge of planning,
building and operating all water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities
in the Special District.



- 16 -
1.02      EAAB is governed by a seven-member Board.  Three Board members re-
p.resent the Municipality, one the Banco de la Republica, and three the hold-
ers of EAAB's bonds. The Board takes all major decisions and appoints the
general manager, who is the chief executive officer, and the four department
managers. The present general manager has been in charge since 1969; his
performance and that of the other key FAAB staff have been good.
7.03      The organizational structure (Annex 10) is functional and adequate.
EAAB had about 1,700 employees in 1970, of which 140 were professionals, 600
administrative and skilled employees, and the rest unskilled. The general
level of competence of the staff is adequate.
7.04      Under Loan 536-CO, EAAB agreed (a) to inform the Bank of any
proposal to appoint a new general manager or new department managers and
give the Bank the opportunity to express its views on such appointments;
(b) to give the Bank the opportunity to comment on any proposed substantial
reorganization of EAAB; and (c) that any amendment in the municipal decree
concerning the constitution of EAAB, without the Bank's prior agreement,
would constitute a default under the Loan. These provisions have been
fully complied with, and they would be repeated under the proposed loan.
B.   Operations
7.05      EAAB has made remarkable progress in improving its operations
over the past three years:
(i)  Unaccounted-for water (difference between volume of water
produced and billed) has been reduced from 32% to 24%
(ii)  Monthly billings and collections have increased by 121% and
133%, respectively (reflecting the 80% tariff increase in
mid-1968 and a reduction of uncollected billings from 7% to
2%)
(iii)  115,000 water meters have been installed, 80,000 in existing
connections (52% of all connections in 1968) and 35,000 in new
ones; as a result, metered consumption has increased from 81%
to 92% of the total.
C.   Management Systems
7.06      Billing and collections are well organized.  Budgeting should be
improved and EAAB has agreed to introduce a more effective budget control
system by the end of 1971. The accounting system is satisfactory, and dur-
ing 1970 EAAB made considerable progress in improving accounting reports.
Thle principal remaining deficiency is in the revaluation of fixed assets;
which, while carried out for rate of return calculations, is not reflected
in the financial statements and does not cover the local cost component of
work in progress. In connection with the proposed loan, EAAB has agreed
to present in its financial statements, starting with fiscal 1971, fixed



- 17 -
assets (including work in progress) revalued with the same index used for
rate of return calculations (paragraph 8.03).
D.   Audit
7.07      EAAB's financial statements are audited by a Colombian firm,
Fermin Paba & Cia. This arrangement is satisfactory. EAAB also has an
internal auditor appointed by and reporting to the Municipality. The
following agreements under Loan 536-CO relating to the aud:Lting would
be repeated under the proposed loan: EAAB will have its accounts
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and will send
the auditor's report to the Bank no later than four months after the
end of the fiscal year.
VIII. FINANCE
8.01      EAAB's finances have remained generally sound since Loan 536-CO
was made in 1968, although the current position was tight in 1968 and 1969.
Earnings have been good, with rates of return on the revalued rate base of
over 9%. Gross fixed assets have grown by about 70%, and about 50% of this
rapid expansion was financed by internal resources. EAAB's financial posi-
tion and earnings are expected to remain satisfactory during and after the
construction period.
A.   Financial Position
8.02      1968-1969 balance sheets, based on audited statements, and a
preliminary balance sheet for 1970 (summarized below), are shown in Annex 12.
Long-term capitalization as of December 31, 1970, was provided principally
by equity (74%), with long-term debt, deposits and provisions for social
benefits accounting for the remaining 26%. Annex 15 gives details on the
composition of liabilities and equity and other important notes to the
financial statements.

8.03      Fixed assets in the above presentation are revalued using the
official cost of living index. This method, which is also used for rate
of return calculations, is reasonable and it would be required under the
proposed loan. Additions to fixed assets in recent years have been sub-
stantial; gross fixed assets at the end of 1970, expressed in 1967 prices,
are 170% of the end-1967 figure. Further substantial additions are ex-
pected in 1971-1972 in connection with the First Project.
8.04      EAAB's current position was tight in 1968 and 1969, but it has
now improved. Current liabilities consist mainly of accounts payable by
EAAB to contractors in connection with water supply and sewerage projects
presently under construction. During 1968 and 1969, EAAB had difficulty
in making timely payments to its suppliers and contractors, due to slow
disbursements by the Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI), a government
financial institution which is assisting EAAB in the financing of the
local currency cost of its current water and sewerage investment program.
Disbursements by IFI during 1970 have been punctual, allowing EAAB to
meet its obligations on time, and accounts payable are now at a reasonable
level. Current liabilities exceed current assets due to EAAB's tight con-
trol of accounts receivable and inventories.
B.  Water and Sewerage Charges
Water Tariffs and Derechos
8.05      EAAB's principal sources of revenue are water tariffs (they
also cover sewerage) and charges known as derechos, collected from pro-
perty owners and land developers (Annex 15). Water tariffs are subject
to the approval of the Junta de Tarifas, the public utility tariff board
of the National Planning Department.
8.06      Under Loan 536-CO, it was agreed that EAAB should earn a rate
of return of at least 5% on its average revalued net fixed water supply and
sewerage assets in operation until completion of the First Bogota Water
Supply Project and 9% thereafter. EAAB's performance under this cove-
nant is reviewed semi-annually, and compliance has been satisfactory.
It would be repeated, except as stated below, under the proposed loan.
8.07      Due to the heavy cash requirements of EAAB during the period
1974-1977, the minimum required rate of return would be 9% up to 1973,
and 10% between 1974 and completion of the Project. After the Project
is completed, cash needs are expected to be adequately covered with a
rate of return of 7 to 8%. The rate of return to be maintained after
completion of the Project would be established at that time in agree-
ment with the Bank after a review of FAAB's financial requirements
(paragraph 8.17).
8.08      Average revenue from water tariffs in 1970 was Col$ 1.22 per
m3 (US$ 0.25 per thousand gallons). A substantial tariff increase (ef-
fective November 15, 1970) is expected to lead to an increase in 1971
of about 28Z in the average revenue expressed in US dollars (to Col$
1.68 per m3 - US$ 0.32 per thousand gallons). This, together with as-



- 19 -
sumed increases in average revenue of 8% per year in the period 1972-1977
(Annex 15), will allow EAAB to make a satisfactory contributiorn to the fi-
nancing of the Project.
8.09      The tariff structure, as is customary in Colombia, is based on
property values (Annex 11). Under Loan 536-CO, EAAB agreed to further
simplify and improve its tariff structure. The new tariffsg are a sub-
stantial step In this direction. During negotiations, EAA13 agreed to
carry out periodic studies of its tariff structure and reviLew with the
Bank the recommendations resulting from such studies.
Other Charges
8.10      Customers pay the cost of the connection, including the cost of
the water meter. Land developers are expected to install or pay for the
installation of local networks (pipes of up to 12-inch diameter). A special
property improvement tax, known as Valorizacion, is levied on all property
owners benefiting from the sewerage master plan works.
C.   Past Earnings
8.11      Audited income statements for 1968-1969 and a preliminary income
statement for 1970 are presented in Annex 13.  Revenues increased by 55%
over the period and expenses, other than depreciation, by 60%.  Due to sub-
stantial additions to EAAB's assets mentioned above, depreciation charges,
which average about 2% of the value of gross fixed assets in operation, in--
creased by 95%. EAAB was able to maintain a satisfactory rate of return of
10% in 1968 and 9% in 1969 and 1970 - well in excess of the minimum of 5%
required under Loan 536-CO. Debt service coverage was ample: in 1970, in-
ternal cash generation was 2.3 times debt service.
D.   Financing Plan
8.12      The forecast of sources and applications of fund[s for 1971-1979
is shown in Annex 14. EAAB's construction expenditures duLring the period
over which the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed (1971-1977) total
Col$ 5.3 billion (US$228 million), including Col$ 2.4 billion (US$104
million) for the Project.
8.13      The proposed plan for financing these expenditures, summarized
below, is satisfactory. Details on the assumptions for the financial
projections are in Annex 15.

8.14      Internal cash generation would be supplemented by proceeds of the
Valorizacion tax, customer contributions and a contribution from EEEB (para-
graph 5.22). The proposed Bank loan has been assumed to carry interest at
a rate of 7-1/4%, and to have a term of 30 years, including 7 years of
grace. The other borrowing (for assumed terms see Annex 15) is covered either
by existing contracts or by firm commitments.
8.15      As stated in paragraph 5.09, construction costs include a provi-
sion for price increases of 8% annually for local costs and 3% for foreign
costs. Similar provisions are included in the projection of operating costs
and revenues. The assumption has also been made that the government will
follow its present policy of keeping the exchange rate flexible and that the
present relation between internal and external prices will be maintained.
T'o this end, the financial projections include an allowance for a 5% annual
increase in the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the Colombian pe-
so during 1971-1977. Projections after 1977 are based on constant 1977
prices.
8.16      Based on the above financing plan, EAAB would be able to carry
out its proposed US$228 million program through 1977. However, to ensure
that investments other than the Project would only be undertaken if ade-
qut ite financing is avallable, the proposed Loan Agreement requires that
c owii11it a:nnu.1 v wtlt the flank on its total investment program dur-
Itish pk- poiAto.  of construetton of the Project.

E.   Future Finances
8.17       Income statements for the period 1971-1979 are forecast in Ani-
nex 13, on the basis of the assumptions shown in Annex 15. The forecasts
show that EAAB's financial performance would continue to be good, withi
rates of return of between 9% (1972) and 12% (1976). EAAB's rate base
would be substantially expanded when the Project is transferred to fixed
assets in operation in 1977. This would lead to a decline in the rate ut
return to 7% in 1978 and 8% in 1979 (see also paragraph 8.07). Debt
service coverage would be satisfactory at its lowest level (2.1 in 1971).
8.18       In connection with Loan 536-CO, EAAB agreed that it would not
incur debt without the Bank's consent unless net income before interest
and depreciation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service in any
future year. This covenant has been repeated in the agreement for the
proposed loan.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01       During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) upon completion of pollution control studies, EAAB will
consult with the Bank on the resulting recommendations
and on their implementation (paragraph 5.27);
(b) the Bank will be given an opportunity to comment on any
proposed new appointment to the positions of gen,eral
manager or department managers, as well as on any pro-
posed substantial reorganization of EAAB (paragraph 7.04);
(c)  EAAB will earn a rate of return on its average revalued
net fixed assets in operation of at least: 9% until 1973 mnd
10% from 1974 until completion of the Project, when an ap-
propriate rate of return for subsequent years would be es--
tablished after agreement with the Bank (paragraphs 8.07
and 8.17);
(d) EAAB will consult annually with the Bank on its total in-
vestment program during the period of construction of the
Project (paragraph 8.16).
9.02       The Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of USS3
million for a term of 30 years including 7 years of grace.

COLOMBIA
SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
EXISTING FACILITIES, FIRST PROJECT AND PRESENT OPERATIONS
All important data on Bogota's water supply, water distribution and sewer-
age facilities, existing or under construction under the current First
Project (financed under Loan 536-CO), are tabulated on pages 5 and 6, and
statistics on EAAB's operations from 1968 to 1970 are summarized on page
7 of this Annex.
The following notes explain the background for these data (see also flaps 1
and 2).
Water Supply:
1.        The Bogota water supply system consists of:
(i) the Tibito scheme, commissioned in 1959, with an initial
capacity of 2.5 m3/sec, expanded to 5.0 m3/sec in 1965, and
currently being further expanded to 12.0 m3/sec (under the
First Project);
(ii) the Tunjuelo scheme, commissioned in 1938 and expanded in
1953, with a capacity of 1.2 m3/sec; and
(iii) several small schemes (San Cristobal, San Francisco, La Osa,
Arzobispo, La Vieja), developed between 1897 and 1966, with
a combined capacity of about 0.5 m3/sec.
2.        The Tibito scheme is based on a water intake from the 3ogota
River, 35 km north of the city, upstream of the point where industrial
and domestic wastes start to pollute the river. The dogota River is par-
tially regulated by three reservoirs in the upper river basin (totalling
890 Mm3). These reservoirs belong to, and are operated by, the EEEB and
CAR, but a joint conmission of EAAB, EEEB and CAR is coordinating the
releases from these reservoirs according to the needs of the three entitics.
Because these needs are sometimes conflicting, it was not expected at the
time of appraisal of the First Project that EAAB could be assured an ab--
straction of more than 8 m3/sec, of the 12 m3/sec total annual average
flow at Tibito. However, further studies in 1968/69 resulted in the Bajo
Teusaca scheme which will partly regulate, and divert to Tibito, the
nearby Teusaca tributary of the Bogota River. This will permit to operate
the Tibito scheme continuously at its full design capacity of 12 m3/sec
(Map 2).



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 7 pages
3.        The water pumping and treatment plant at Tibito (conventional treat-
,e.It: flocculation-sedimentation-filtration) was originally designed for
3 m31sec with a provision to double its capacity to 6 m3/sec by duplicating
all installations. Ilowever, based on more advanced treatment design criteria,
the First Project will increase the treatment capacity to 12 m3/sec (four
times the initial capacity) by adding only 50% of new flocculation-sedimenta-
tion capacity, replacing the rapid sand filters of the existing filter basins
by dual filter media (anthracite-sand), and introducing more efficient oper-
ating rules. The First Project includes also a second raw water pumping
station (operating in parallel with the existing station) and a treated water
booster pumping station operating over both transmission lines. The water
transmission capacity, initially limited to 2.5 m3/sec under a gravity opera-
tion of the 60-inch pipeline, has been increased to 4.7 m3/sec by booster
pLumping on both ends of that pipeline (Tibito and Usaquen) and will reach
12 rLu3/sec after completion of the new 78-inch pipeline.
4.        The Tunjuelo scheme is a gravity scheme, drawing water from the
Regadera Reservoir on thle Tunjuelo River, 25 km south of the city, with
a treatment plant (Vitelma) at the southern city limits. This treatment
plant is directlv connected with the distribution system and serves most
of the high lying areas along the eastern city limits. The Tunjuelo River
Ls insufficiently regulated by the three small reservoirs of the EAAB
(totalling 11.5 Mm3) and causes frequent serious flooding in the south-western
sections of the city. Another reservoir (Cantarrana) is therefore planned
iv connection with the future Sumapaz scheme (Annex 2 and Map 1).  Original-
ly, the Cantarrana reservoir was designed as the main element of a separate
niew 2.0 m3/sec supply scheme, and was expected to be constructed in 1973/74.
The favorable results of the investigations on the larger Chingaza scheme,
hiowever, have made that scheme much more attractive as the next supply in-
crenment after Tibito.
5.        Of the small schemes, listed under (iii) above, only the San
CrisLobal scheme, connected to the Vitelma treatment plant, and the San
Francisco system, with a separate small treatment plant (San Diego), have
somle significance. The others are serving isolated high lying sections of
tile city.
Water Distribution:
6.        The city is divided into three distribution zones (low, intermediate,
jll is), of which the low zone, supplied from Tibito, is by far the largest.
The intermediate zone forms a narrow stretch between the two other zones; it
is conlnected to the Parque Nacional tank which receives some water by gravity
from Vitelma, and some from Tibito with booster pumping at Usaquen. This
intermediate zone will be abolished and incorporated partly in the low,
partly in the high zone, as soon as service conditions and water pressures
im,uprove after completion of the First Project.
7.        Total length of the distribution system is about 3,000 km; 90%
of the pipes lhave diameters below 10-inch. The usual pipe materials are



ANNEX I
Page 3 of 7 pages
galvanized iron for diameters of 3-inch and smaller, asbestos cement (68%
of all distribution pipes) for diameters from 4-inch to 12-inch, and con-
crete for most of the pipes of 24-inch and above.
8.        The distribution program under the First Project includes the
following elements:
(i)  The main grid will be substantially expanded with a 25 km
78-inch trunk pipe (continuation of the new Tibito trans-
mission line) connecting the northern and the south-western
parts of the city, and terminating in the new Casablanca
tank. About 70 km of large diameter (24-inch and 42-inch)
pipes will link the 78-inch trunk pipe with the existing grid
of the city center. The Casablanca tank (140,000 m3) will
almost double the installed storage capacity and -- by bal-
ancing pressures throughout the city -- help to improve
water service in the heavily populated and industrialized
south and south-west.
(ii) About 85 km of additional medium diameter (12-inch) pipes
will support the expanded grid and improve the hydraulic
capacity of the existing grid.
(iii) The entire distribution system will be rehabilitated, based
on a comprehensive pitometric survey carried out in 1968-70.
Coupled with an intensive metering program (replacement of
old, not repairable meters, repair of damaged meters, instal-
lation of meters in previously unmetered connections and in
all new connections), this will improve water service and
help to locate water losses and reduce wastage.
Sewerage and Drainage
9.        The Bogota sewerage system is divided into three sectors, which
correspond to the natural drainage basins of the small Salitre, Fucha
and Tunjuelo streams flowing from the east to the west of the city, and
discharging into the Bogota River. About 60% of the 20,000 ha forming
the Sanitary District are developed areas; of these, half (the older part)
have a combined sewerage/strom water drainage system and the other half
a separate system. After completion of the current sewerage and drainage
master plan, the present system (serving about 80% of the 2.5 million
population) will be expanded to serve a population of 3.5 million (expected
by 1975). The master plan provides for a system of large open drainage
channels with parallel sewage interceptors covering the entire Sanitary
District and extending over a distance of 15 km from the eastern city limits
to the Bogota River.
10.       The limited hydraulic capacity of the natural Bogota River bed
prevents a full discharge of the storm water and sewage flows from Bogota
city whenever the flow of the river is above normal, and causes frequent



ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 7 pages
flooding in large areas along the Bogota River and, compounded by its own
floods, the Tunjuelo River.  This problem will be largely resolved, when
the planned BogoL" River regulation project (canalization along a 40 km
section upstream Alicachin, with straightening of the river course and
deepening of the river bed) will be completed. Feasibility studies for
this project, which will probably be executed by CAR (because it will be
located mostly outside the limits of the Special District), are under way;
the time-table for construction will depend on several factors, including
the urgency with which the Special District wants to develop the areas now
subject to flooding.
11.       Another problem is the increasing pollution of the Bogota River
by the - so far - untreated sewage from Bogota and from industrial plants
located between Bogota city and the Tibito water supply plant. Various
sewage treatment alternatives have been studied since 1965. The use of
sewage oxidation lagoons, at some stage considered to be the most economical
solution, was discarded because it would have required large areas of
valuable land and would have been a barrier for development of the city
toward the west. Current studies concentrate on one or several sewage
treatment plants to be located prior to the discharge into the Bogota
river, or -- alternatively -- a high capacity sewage interceptor to be
constructed along the future Bogota River channel and discharging directly
into the tunnel-penstock system of the Bogota hydroelectric power scheme.
The second alternative would, of course, not resolve, but only remove the
pollution problem from the Bogota area further downstream (where less people
would be affected and where additional tributaries would help to dilute the
pollution). As indicated elsewhere in this report, the Chingaza water
supply scheme will, at least, temporarily reduce the pollution problem
because during the early years after completion of the various stages of
this sclheme, the EAAB will operate the Tibito scheme only as a supplement
to Chingaza and abstract less than the full 12 m3/sec from the Bogota River.

SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
BOGOTA WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Background
1.        The main objective of the Bogota Water Resources Development Plan
is to coordinate the programs for expansion of the Bogota water supply sys-
tem of diverting water from outside basins into the Bogota. River Basin,
with the possibilities of utilizing the increased power generating poten-
tial from these diversions. The main features of this Plan, which has
only evolved during the past year and is still in a preliminary stage, are
shown on Map 1 and explained below:
2.        In its long range water supply master plan, the EAAB has iden-
tified three major future water sources, all of which require diversion
from outside basins into Bogota River basin:
(i)  the Chingaza scheme, which would divert to Bogota up to
20 ml/sec through a 39-km tunnel-cum-pipeline system by
gravity from two reservoirs on the upper Guatiquia and
Chuza Rivers in the eastern slopes of the Cordillera
Oriental; including about 2.0 m3/sec from en-route catch-
ments of tributaries of the Bogota River, the total yield
of the Chingaza scheme is estimated to 22 m3/sec;
(ii)  the Sumapaz scheme, which would divert up to 30 m3/sec
from various rivers in the Sumapaz region (50-80 km
south of Bogota by gravity through a tunnel system with
direct river intakes;
(iii) the Alto Suarez scheme, which would divert about 10 m3/sec
from the upper Suarez River through a system of pumping
stations and pipelines along a 60-km section north of the
upper Bogota River basin;
These three schemes would cover Bogota's water demand through at least the
year 2000.
Selection of the Chingaza Scheme
3.        Among these three schemes, the Chingaza scheme is by far the most
attractive for development as the next source of water supply for Bogota:
It is relatively close to Bogota, has a high yield, requires no pumping and
little treatment, and offers good reservoir sites. The high yield of the
Chingaza scheme results from very intensive rainfalls and, in turn, high
run-offs, especially if compared with the run-offs of the other basins:

Bogota (at Alicachin)   4,300            24                 6
The proportionately high yield of the Chingaza scheme has been
khown only since 1969, after sufficient hydrological data from stations in
tLle Chingaza area became available. This explains why -- based on correlation
with other basins -- the yield was originally assumed to be less than half
of thie present estimates.
Pow.er Aspects
5.        The diversion of in total up to 60 m3/sec from the Chingaza,
Sumapaz and Alto Suarez schemes would substantially increase the flow of
thIe Bogota River downstream from Bogota, where the EEEB is at present
completinig the construction of a 550 MW hydroelectric system, consisting
of tour plants (Canoas, Salto, Laguneta and Colegio). These plants are
Airtanged in cascade along the 25 km below Alicachin, with a total head of
1,800 m one of the world's most favorable siting conditions for hydroelec-
tric power generation. They are designed for a maximum flow of 40 m3/sec,
but operated only with an average of 20 m3/sec, because the average river
flow is 24 m3/sec and the existing reservoirs (Cuatavita Sisga, Neusa,
tuna), totalling 960 Mm3, do not permit a full regulation of the river in
accordance with the seasonal variations of power demand and with the require-
inetts of the other users (EAAB, CAR).
6.        Only a small portion of the increase in power generation potential
fruii the planned diversions could be utilized in the existing EEEB plants.
It is therefore envisaged to construct a second system parallel to the
existiLng generating system. Preliminary studies indicate that a 60 m3/sec
diiversion to the Bogota basin might permit installation of up to 2,000 MW
additional power generating capacity.
Proposed Plan
7.        One of the basic objectives in most water resources planning is
to provide for reservoirs which permit to regulate the seasonal variations
of the natural river flows. The lack of suitable reservoir sites (except
for the small Cantarrana reservoir), is the main disadvantage of the
Sumapaz scheme and has led to the key elements of the present Bogota Water
lesources Development Plan, namely:



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 3 pi':lv
(i)  interconnection of the Sumapaz with the Chingaza and Bogota
River schemes, by extending the Sumapaz transmission system
from the Cantarrana reservoir via the Calera reservoir
(Chingaza scheme) to the Guatavita reservoir (Bogota scheme)
with three intermediate pumping stations;
(ii)  increasing the available reservoir volume by raising some of
the existing reservoirs, and constructing new reservoirs:
(a)  raising the Guatavita, Sisga and Muna                3
reservoirs                                    190 Mm
(b) Chingaza scheme reservoirs:
Chuza            200
Chingaza         460            3
Calera            50      710 Mm
(c)  other reservoirs:  Cantarana           50
Alto Muna        200            3
Herrera-Bojaca  150       400 Mm
1,300 Mm3
(increase of 135% over existing
reservoir volume of 960 Mm3)
Future Possibilities
8.        The three diversion schemes were selected by EAAB, because they
do require no pumping (Chingaza, Sumapaz) or relatively little pumping
(Alto Suarez). In conjunctiont with the power generation aspects, further
diversions -- either from the same areas, or from others --- which require
pumping but would still leave sufficient "net head" for pover generation,
could become attractive in the future.
9.        The following schemes have been tentatively identified for such
further diversions to the Bogota Basin:

However, these long range possibilities have not been sufEiciently studied
at this time, and are not shown on Map 1.

CHINGAZA SCHEME
1.        The Chingaza scheme, as currently defined and shown in tlap 2,
will divert up to 20 m3/sec from several eastern flowing rivers (tribu-
taries of the Meta River), through a direct tunnel-cum-pipeline system to
Bogota. 12 m3/sec of these 20 m3/sec would be obtained from the two
principal sources, the Chuza River and the Guatiquia River, both of which
would be regulated by reservoirs (Chuza reservoir with 200 Mm3 and Chingaza
reservoir with 460 Mm3). The remaining 8 m3/sec would be obtained from
unregulated catchments en-route (Rio Blanco 1.4 m3/sec; Chuza-West 1.5
m3/sec and Rio Blanco-West 0.4 m3/sec) or from additional diversions toward
the Chuza reservoir (Chingaza-South 1.3 m3/sec and Chuza-North 4.3 m3/sec).
2.        Furthermore, the Chingaza scheme will include regulation of the
upper Teusaca basin (Calera reservoir with 50 Mm3) , a triLbutary of the
Bogota River, which will yield an additional 1.2 m3/sec.
3.        Page 3 of this Annex lists the characteristics of the various
basins and sub-basins, the different stages of development of the scheme
and the main works to be constructed under each of these stages. Except
for Stage I, the proposed Project (for technical details see Annex 4), the
exact composition, yield and time-table for construction of the different
stages has to be confirmed in further studies. For example, not all of the
additional catchments beyond the 12 m3/sec development may prove technically
feasible or economically justified. On the other hand, some of works shown
under Stage II.A might be advanced, because of cost considerations (small
additions to main contracts for Stage I) or for power generation purposes.
Selection of Least-Cost Solution
4.        Several alternatives have been studied to arrive at the least-
cost solution. These refer to different conveyance systems, different stag-
ing of the scheme, and to a different order of implementing the various
elements of the proposed system:
5.        Convyance System:  Originally, when the schemie was expected to
yield only 6 m /sec, a surface conveyance system with short tunnel sections
was designed, which originated at the Chingaza reservoir (then estimated to
yield 3.5 m3/sec) and water from the Chuza reservoir (then estimated to



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
yield 2.5 m3/sec) would have been pumped with a pumping head of 300 m into
the Chingaza reservoir. Compared with the now proposed solution, the
present value (capital and operating costs) of that earlier solution is
higlher at all discount rates below 20% (for example, at a discount rate of
8%, it is 40% higher).
6.        Staging:  The possibilities of staging the Chingaza are limited
to the source development, because even initially low water flows require
completion of the full length of the conveyance system. Under the proposed
solution, where 33 km of the 39 km conveyance system would be tunnels with
a diameter determined by the minimum feasible diameter for construction,
only the short pipeline sections (probably two parallel pipes), can be built
in stages.
7.        Order of implementation:  As an alternative to the proposed program,
it was considered to advance the catchment of en-route sources (Rio Blanco,
Rio Bl3anco-West and Teusaca, with a total yield of 3.0 m3/sec) and postpone
completion of the full conveyance up to Chuza by one or two years. However,
the present value of this alternative is higher than that of the proposed
solution, at all discount rates below 20%. Furthermore, this alternative
would have created considerable technical and operational difficulties.

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF PROPOSED PROJECT
The following is a summary of important technical details of the various
works and services included in the proposed Project (Chingaza-I scheme,
distribution works, provision of equipment, and engineering):
A. CHINGAZA - I
The Bogota Water Resources Plan, of which the Chingaza scheme is the first
step, is described in Annex 2 and Map 1, and the various stages of the
development of the Chingaza scheme are explained in Annex 3 and Map 2.
1. GENERAL GEOLOGY
The Project area is covered with sedimentary rocks belonging to ages
from the lower cretaceous to the upper tertiary. Some recent sediments
such as alluvial gravels, glaciofluvial deposits and glacial morraines
are found locally. In general, the rocks are shales, quartizitic sand-
stones and claystones interbedded with friable sandstones. The whole
area has been subject to intensive tectonic movements, that have caused
many structural features, such as folds, faults, and joint systems.
II. CHUZA DAM
Dam Site: in a narrow canyon, upstream of the confluence of Chuza
and Guatiquia Rivers; various alternative dam sites with-
in this canyon are being investigated.
Geology at dam site: Both sides of the very steep natural slopes of the
canyon show outcrops of very hard quartizitic sandstone, inter-
beded with layers of pyrite-rich soliceous shale and slate.
Type of Dam: Presumably earthfill, but provided current investigations
prove favorable geology of the abutments, dam site could also
be feasible for concrete arch dam. Further studies and cost
comparisons of the two alternatives are necessary, before a
decision can be taken.
Embankment (for earthfill dam): Total volume 1.1 Mm3; material homo-
geneous rocks, available nearby; sloped 1:1.5
30 cm concrete lining and injection curtain on water side.

d) Filtration        28 basins (6 gpm/ft2)   32 basins (4 gpm/ft2)
with contact flocculation
V. ACCESS ROADS
Road access into the Chuza-Chingaza area exists via Fomeq[ue (98 km from
Bogota) and via Siberia-Palacio (63 km from Bogota). 76 km of these access
roads, including the access to the adit and the lower portal of the Palacio-
Rio Blanco tunnel, have been or are being constructed under the First Proj-
ect. The additional 35 km of access roads under the proposed Project con-
sist mainly of the final road along the Chuza reservoir (preliminary access
will be submerged) and of short sections from the main access roads to the
various work areas.
B. DISTRIBUTION WORKS
The distribution program under the First Project will continue through
mid-1972 and will provide most of the basic distribution grid in the
developing northern, western and southwestern areas of the city.
Except for the 20-km 78-inch trunk line connecting the Usaquen
Tunnel with the Parque Nacional Tank and the Casablanca Tank, the distribution
works to be carried out under the proposed Project from mid-1972 through
1976 have still to be defined in detail. It is expected that about 100 km
of medium diameter (12-inch) pipes and several storage tanks totalling 200,000
m3 will be constructed during the Project period. Distribution system rehab-
ilitation will continue, and several isolated and highlying areas -- currently
supplied from obsolete and uneconomic secondary sources, or through water
tank trucks -- will be connected to the main water distribution system by
means of booster pumping stations.

b)   Spare parts for booster pumping station Usaquen
c)   Additional chlorine cylinders for treatment plants
d)   Equipment required for engineering investigations (hydro-
logy, geology, topography, raw water and sewage treatment
pilot studies) and laboratory work (chemical, bacteriolo-
gical, mechanical).
D. ENGINEERING
I.   Design and Construction Supervision of the Proposed Prolect
a)   Feasibility Study:
Under the First Project, the EAAB contracted the services
of Ingetec Ltds., a Colombian consulting firm, to lprepare
a "Technical and Economic Feasibility Study for the Chingaza-
Teusaca and Cantarrana Projects" (contract dated Hay 27, 1968),
later limited to the Chingaza Project.
With additions to that contract, dated January 22, March 4
and May 15, 1969, the EAAB agreed that Ingetec subcontracted
the following advisors (all from the U.S.):
(i) Engineering Science International (ESI) for all water
treatment aspects.
ii)  Mr. B. Cooke, on the design of the tunnel and the dam.
(iii) Mr. R. Marsal, on soil mechanics and construction materials.
(iv) Messrs. J. A. Trantina and R. Goodmann, for geologal
investigations.
Ingetec and its advisors prepared several prelimirnary reports.
The final Feasibility Report, on which appraisal of the Project
by the Bank was based, was completed in November 11970.
b)   Design and Preparation of Specifications for Chuza Dam
and Chuza-Bogota Conveyance System:
These designs have been contracted with Ingetec, on September 5,
1969. Preliminary designs were included in the November 1970
Feasibility Report. Bidding documents with speciiEications for
the tunnels were completed in February 1971 and dLstributed to
interested firms on March 2, 1971.
Design of the dam and of the non-tunnel elements of the convey-
ance system (pipelines, short surface channels, and supplementary
works) is pending. Final design of the dam is exlpected to be
subcontracted by Ingetec to a foreign firm (EAAB has requested
proposals from Ingetec).
c)   Design of the Sapo Water Treatment Plant:
This design has been contracted on January 15, 1970 with a joint
venture composed of ESI (see above) and Sociedad Salgado Piedra-
hita Escallon Ltda. (SOTEC), a Colombian consulting firm.



ANNEX 4
Page 8 of 8 pages
The contract is divided into two parts:
Part I: Pilot Plant Studies and Preliminary Design
Part II: Final Design
Part I is under way; pilot plants have been operated on the
Guatiquia, Chuza and Blanco Rivers, and several interim reports
on the pilot testing results have been submitted so far.
d)   Construction Supervision:
The EAAB is considering to contract consulting firms for the
following construction supervision services:
(i)  for the Chuza Dam
(ii) for the Palacio-Rio Blanco, Siberia and Usaquen tunnels
(and the Guatiquia tunnel, if included in the Project)
(iii) for the Sapo Water Treatment Plant
(iv) for the pipeline sections of the Chuza-Bogota conveyance
system (Simaya pipeline and Teusaca syphon) and the 78-inch
distribution trunk line Usaquen-Parque Nacional-Casablanca.
Some of these different construction supervision services may
be combined, or may be contracted with the consulting firms in
charge of the design of the respective project elements.
All other construction supervision (minor works, access roads,
etc.) would be carried out directly by EAAB staff.
II. Studies for Future Water Supply, Sewerage, Drainage, Flood Control
and Pollution Control Schemes
The following studies and other engineering services are likely
to be required and, to the extent local or foreign consultants would be
contracted, would be financed under the proposed Loan:
a)   Participation by EAAB in the studies for the regional Water
Resources Development Plan (see Annex 2).
b)   Continuation of preliminary investigation on the Sumapaz,
Alto Suarez and other future water diversion schemes.
c)   Further water distribution and distribution system rehabil-
itation studies.
d)   Sewerage, Drainage and Flood Control studies for area with-
in, or adjacent to, the Special District; including, to the
extent EAAB participation is required, preparation of the
Bogota river regulation project.
e)   Studies for, and design of, sewage treatment plants or
other means of pollution control in the Bogota River basin
near and downstream of Bogota.

only been made for Demand Assumption "A"; effects of "B" are insignificant through 1979, the
period covered in the financial projections.
3/ * - Annual Supply is below System Capacity even in years where Annual Demand is above System Capacity,
due to limited absorption capacity of distribution system after introduction of new supply schemes or
of additions to existing schemes following a period of supply deficits.  (See Annex 8, page 3)

SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
COST - BENEFIT ANALYSIS
1.        The internal financial rate of return (IFR) on the additional
investment needed to obtain 12 m3/sec from the Chingaza water diversion
project, to treat and distribute the water, and to expand the sewerage
system, is the discount rate which equalizes the present values of the
net benefits generated by the project over its physical life (assumed to
be about 75 years) with its capital costs. With the assumptions detailed
below, the IFR is 14.6%.
2.        A sensitivity analysis shows that this rate would decline by
about 3 percentage points if the demnand for water is 20% below the forecast.
The other assumptions tested resulted in even smaller reductions in the IFR
and a risk analysis of the IFR was not considered necessary.
The Program
3.        The program covered in this analysis includes the water supply
and distribution elements of the proposed Project (which would expand
supply by 7.5 m3/sec in 1977), the Guatiquia tunnel and associated water
treatment and distribution works (an additional 4.5 m3/sec, assumed to
become available in 1982), and sewerage works required as a result of
increased water consumption. The full capacity of the Chingaza scheme is
estimated at 22 m3/sec, and the tunnels included in the proposed Project
have this capacity.  tiowever, the cost and timing of future stages of the
scheme after the 12 m3/sec stage are somewhat uncertain and the calculation
was therefore limited to this capacity. It is probable that the IFR of thle
complete Chingaza scheme will be higher than that of the portion considered
here, as it will not be necessary to duplicate the major investments for
the conveyance system (the tunnel).
4.        The IFR on the 7.5 m3/sec proposed Project considered in isolation
was not calculated because it is impossible to arrive at a reasonable
allocation of the cost of the joint elements (e.g. tunnels) between the
Project and the subsequent stages of the Chingaza scheme.
Costs
5.        Colombia's economy is relatively free of controls, and market
prices can be taken as a good approximation to the economic cost of the
goods and services (local and imported) consumed for the construction and
operation of the project. EAAB is exempt from taxes and import duties, so
there is no need to adjust for transfer payments. The cosits considered
are as follows:

6.        The calculation is carried out at constant prices, as no price
changes affecting the project other than those associated with inflation
are anticipated. Price contingencies are therefore excluded from capital
costs.
Water Benefits
7.        The quantifiable benefits of the program to water consumers are
assumed to be measured by the revenues from water sales and the other charges
collected by EAAB (derechos, Valorizacion, etc.), insofar as they are
attributable to the program. Water sales are projected using the basic
demand forecast, Annex 8.
8.        Additional benefits, not considered in the calculation of the
IFR, include: (a) public health benefits, (b) teiimporary reduction of the
pollution of the Bogota river during the dry season, and (c) general
improvement of the urban environment, all of which are very difficult to
quantify. A part of these benefits might be reflected in the revenues
from sales and other charges collected by EAAB.
9.        Also excluded are the following quantifiable benefits, on which
adequate information is not available at this time: (a) as a result of
the increased reliability of water supply, it will no longer be necessary
to install roof tanks and individual booster pumping facilities, (except
in lhigh rise buildings), and (b) the diversion of additional water into
the Bogota river basin will permit increased irrigation of agricultural
land in this area.
Power Benefits
1M.       Power benefits will be obtained immediately from the diversion
of water by the Chingaza Scheme into the Bogota river basin because of the
additional power generation in EEEB's existing hydroelectric plants in the
river. This additional generation will not involve additional investment
in the power system. Along 25 km of the river, with a total head of 1,800 m
ILB i,s completing at present the construction of a 550 MW hydroelectric
dvcvelopmuent of 4 plants arranged in cascade, designed for a maximum flow
,, V4( 11i3/sec. The average river flow is 24 m3/sec, of which an average of
) ill/slsc are utilized at present for power generation.  The additional



ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 4 pages
generation in EEEB's plants, based on the diversion by the Chingaza scheme
of 7.5 m3/sec from 1977, would be 760 GWh/year; after the completion of
the Guatiquia tunnel, the diversion by the scheme will increase to 12 m3/sec,
and the total additional generation to 1,360 (Wh/year. This generation will
essetntially be of the run-of-river type, i.e., to supply base load, as there
is insufficient reservoir capacity in the Bogota river to fully regulate
the water flow. The economic value of such generation is estimated to be
about 3 US mills/kWh.
11.       The Chingaza scheme would eventually add up to 20 m3/sec to the
Bogota basin, increasing substantially its hydroelectric potential, which
would be increased further by transfers from future schemes (Sumapaz with
30 m3/sec, Suarez with 10 m3/sec). The construction of additional water
regulating and power generating facilities in the Bogota basin is being
considered, to make full use of its increased hydroelectric potential.
The above quantification of power benefits from the Project does not
include the further important benefits associated with these prospective
developments.
12.       Preliminary engineering studies indicate that, in conjunction with
the Chingaza diversion, a new plant of about 600 MW could be installed in
parallel with EEEB's existing plants, at a relatively low cost. The other
prospective future diversions would permit the further installation of
important additional capacity. The installation of the 600 MW plant and/or
other possible new hydroelectric developments in the Bogota basin will have
to be analyzed and planned as part of the power generation program for
ISA's interconnected system. From the discussions held with EAAB, EEEB,
ISA and Planeacion, it is expected that such joint analysi,s and planning
will be performed in the immediate future.
Sensitivity Analysis
13.       The results of a series of tests of the sensitivity of the IFR
to unfavorable changes in the assumptions are tabulated below. As can be
seen from the table, the greatest reduction is produced if the demand for
water is 20% lower than assumed in the forecast. Even under these conditions,
the IFR is 12%. If benefits to the power sector are excluded from the IFR,
the rate of return is still above 12%.

4.   Excluding power benefits -                                          12.9
5.   (a)  Fixed operating costs 20% hiiglher than assumed --             14.2
(b)  Variable operating costs 20%, higher than assumed -           14.5
6.   Overrun of 20% in capital costs -                                   12.5
7.   Construction period extended by one year, with capital
costs higlher in the last year by US$10 million -                   13.7

COLOMBIA
SECOND BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
NOTES ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS
Revenues
1.        Sales revenue for 1971 is based on the present tariffs (Annex 11).
Thereafter, average revenue is assumed to increase by about 8% per year,
from Col$1.68 per m3 in 1971 to Col$2.66 per m3 in 1977. This could be the
result of:
(i) the updating of: (a) EAAB's records on customer property
assessments to make them coincide with the Bogota cadastral
survey - resulting in the transfer of about 80,000 customers
to higher categories, and (b) the cadastral survey itself, to
reflect the general increase in property values in Bogota;
(ii) if increases in average revenue due to these factors fail to
materialize, an increase in water tariffs; or
(iii) some combination of (i) and (ii).
2.        Derechos are charges levied on property-owners and land developers,
as follows:
(i) "Derechos de Matricula" are charged for the right to obtain
a connection to the system, at a rate equal to 3% of the
assessed value of the property to be connected; these charges
amounted to Col$64 million in 1970; and
(ii) "Derechos de Suministro" are based on the area in a housing
development to be served by the system; they amounted to
Col$6 million in 1970.
Revenues from this source were projected by forecasting construction expen-
diture in EAAB's service areas. Other revenues (reconnection charges, fines,
etc.) are assumed to increase gradually with sales.
Costs
3.        All costs include price increases of 8% per year over the-period
1971-1977.



ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 7 pages
4.         Salaries and Wages are based on actual payroll, plus social
security and other wage-related costs for 1971. A detailed projection of
1971-1975 staffing requirements was made by EAAB, and reasonable provisions
for further growth in staff used for the period 1975-1979. Wage rates were
assumed to increase by 10% per year in current pesos until 1977 and by 2% per
year in 1977 pesos thereafter.
5.        Other operating expenses based on:
(i) projected chemical and power consumption for treating and
pumping the following volumes of water (in M m3), which in
turn are based on forecast sales and an expected gradual
improvement in water accounted for from 74% in 1971 to 77%
in 1979:

(ii)  materials, supplies and services based on actual 1970 costs,
with expenditures other than chemicals and pumping increasing
by 10% per year in constant pesos;
(iii)  annual provision for bad debts increasing from Col$4 million
in 1971 to Col$16 million in 1977 in current pesos, and Col$19
million in 1979 in 1977 pesos.
6.         Depreciation for 1968-1969 has been increased to reflect the re-
valuation of fixed assets.  Forecast depreciation based on revalued assets
and the following accounting lives: (physical lives are expected to be
somewhat longer):
Tunnels                                          75 years
Dams                                             50  "

Vehicles, maintenance equipment, etc.              5
Current assets and liabilities
?.        Accounts receivable are assumed to maintain the s8me relationship
to revenues plus customer contributions as in recent years (about 20%).



ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 7 pages
8.        Inventories have been projected on the basis of forecast require-
ments for meters, chemicals, spare parts and construction and maintenance
materials. They do not include construction inventories for the Project
and other major projects, which would be carried by contractors. The low
level of inventories shown for 1971 is a result of EAAB's intensive meter-
ing program, which is temporarily depleting meter inventories.
9.        Short term investments presently consist mainly of bonds acquired
by EAAB as a reserve for construction of extensions of the central office
buildings. All surplus cash not required for day-to-day operation is
assumed to be invested.
10.       Accounts payable are expected to build up until 1975 when the work
on the proposed project would peak, and decline thereafter as EAAB's
obligations to contractors and suppliers are paid off. An average payment
lag of about 2 months is assumed.
Fixed assets and rate base
11.       EAAB's audited financial statements have been adjusted to include
revalued fixed assets. Gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation are
assumed to be revalued with the increase in the cost of living index,
estimated at 6% for 1970 and 8% for 1971-1977. The rate base calculation
is shown in the following table.

30, 1971.
(iv) Col$7 million in 1971 from the Instituto de Credito
Territorial. Terms assumed: loan bearing interest
at 15%, six years maturity.
17.       The Banco de la Republica, acting for the holders of EAAB's pre-
sently outstanding bonds, has agreed to reschedule them over a thirty year
period starting in 1971. The rate of interest would continue at 6%.
Equity
18.        Equity as of December 31, 1970 (preliminary - in Col$ million):

Valorizacion
19.        This one-time property improvement tax is levied on all property
owners benefiting from major sewerage projects. It is supposed to recover
the full cost of such projects and includes a provision to cover the cost of
assessing and collecting the tax. In practice, EAAB expects to receive only
about 85% of the cost of the works, after deducting the administration fee
and various rebates which are allowed, e.g. for early payment. Property
owners are allowed up to five years for installment payment of large assess-
ments. It is assumed that a total of Col$430 million would be received by
EAAB from this source during the period 1969-1982, after all deductions, on
account of major sewerage works estimated to cost Col$500 million to be
carried out over the period 1967-1975. Of this amount, Col$24 million has
already been received in 1969-1970. EAAB is currently collecting this tax
in the northern section of Bogota. Collections for the central section
would start in 1971 and for the southern section in 1973.
Customer Contributions
20.        Customer contributions forecast on the basis of expected expendi-
tures for local water distribution and sewerage networks and for customer
connections; any reduction in these contributions would be compensated by
an equal reduction in construction expenditures.



ANNEX 15
Page 7 of 7 pages
EEEB Contribution
21.       EEEB has agreed that its contribution of Col$280 million will be
disbursed over the period 1972-1976 in the annual amounts shown in Annex
14. EEEB has recently been granted substantial tariff increasses and should
have no difficulty in providing these funds. The contribution is treated
as a contribution to EAAB's equity, even though EEEB has proposed that it
be considered for the time being as a "loan" bearing interest: at 9%, as
both principal and interest would be payable, if at all, only in the form
of diverted water. The "loan" thus does not constitute a monetary liabil-
ity for EAAB.
