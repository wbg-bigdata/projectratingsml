ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Five coastal municipalities of the Republic of Montenegro (Bar, Budva, Kotor, Tivat and
Ulcinj) are supplied with water from local sources and the remaining one (Herceg Novi)
receives the majority of the water from neighbouring Croatia. Hydrogeological analyses
show that local water sources have almost reached the limits of their capacities, and cannot
provide additional quantities of water during the summer season.
On the other side, the development of coastal region and expansion of tourism capacities
practically depend on the provision of additional water quantities.
The project will provide the stabile water supply on the southern region of Montenegro,
covering the territories of the municipalities of Herceg Novi, Kotor, Budva, Tivat, Bar and
Ulcinj. According to the last Census (2003), the number of inhabitants in this area was
around 170.000. This number significantly increases in the peak tourist season. Total
demand, even today, is higher than the production and water deficit will reach 1.500 Itr/sec
by the year 2033.
In 2005, a ((Cost-benefit analysis of possible solutions for the long-term water supply of
Montenegrin Coast>> has been carried out. The analysis was made with the aim of bringing
the final decision on water source for the regional water supply system of Montenegrin
Coast. The initial assessments and investigations narrowed the selection of water sources
to five locations: Karuc, Bisevina-Bolje sestre, Vucko Blato, Tusko Poije and Bojana River.
The Study resulted with the conclusion that the most feasible locations are water sources
from the Karuc and from Malo Blato basin. In the location Malo Blato two-microlocation
have been analized: Bolje Sestre spring and Bisevina River. During the 2005 and 2006
investigation activities have been conducted at the microlocations Karuc, Bisevina River
and Bolje sestre spring. Engineering requirements, wider area for sanitary protection of the
water intake and lower water quality then the other two alternatives eliminated Bisevina
River as the microlocation for the water intake. Additional investigations revealed significant
advantages of Bolje sestre over Karuc, and finally Bolje sestre source has been selected for
long-term water supply of Montenegrin Coast.
Karuc as the water intake for the RWSS has been included in the Special Plan of the
Republic Montenegro. Replacing the water intake microlocation from Karuc to Boije sestre
is ongoing process. It is envisaged for the RWSS to have maximum capacity of 1500 I/s,
where at the source itself water capturing is planned in two phases:
1000 I/s in the beginning (to meet the demands at least until 2020),
* additional 500 I/s in the 2nd phase
The entire system is around 140 km long, and its construction will last around 3 years.
RWSS of the Montenegrin Coast consist of the two subsystems: continental part and
coastal part.
The continental part stretches from the water intake Bolje sestre, through the hydrotechnical
tunnel Sozina, to reservoir ,,Djurmani", the main water storage tank in the system. The route
partly stretches over the Skadar Lake area.
The coastal part is divided into southern and northern branch. The northern branch, 73 km
long, stretches from the reservoir,,Djurmani" to the municipalities of Budva, Kotor, Tivat and
Herceg Novi. The southern branch, totalling 34 km in length, is envisaged for the water
supply of the municipalities of Bar and Ulcinj.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
Considering the concept of the regional water supply system of the coastal region of
Montenegro, the project may be divided into: inland part - encompassing the Skadar Lake
Basin, and Montenegrin Coast.
Location of the water source for the water supply system of Montenegrin coast, as well as
20 km long pipeline, is situated in the Skadar Lake basin. Skadar Lake is National Park i.e.
the natural value of interest for the Republic of Montenegro.
Malo blato is a separate water basin (it looks like the lake's gulf), and it is also part of the
Skadar Lake and belongs to the protected area of the Skadar Lake National Park. Malo
blato has typical characteristics regarding biodiversity, geomorphology, hydrogeology,
thermal regime, etc. as the Skadar Lake. In this area, there are no registered rare or
endangered species. In that sense the Study analyzed the Skadar Lake as the sensitive
wider environment and the Bolje sestre spring as the microlocation.
Skadar Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in Europe and has an extremely wide
floodplain in its northern part. Ramsar convention from 1996 included Skadar Lake into list
of internationally important swamps, as significant water birds' habitat.
Ecosystem of the lake is extremely complex, sub-Mediterranean type, with dominant
wetland biotypes, which cover mainly northern side, and thus represents important habitat
for bird survival. It is related to the general high production of organic mass in this area,
from plankton production, to invertebrates and fish, birds and mammals.
Malo blato area, thus the Bolje sestre source, is not known as an area inhabited with
specific plant or animal species, and is not included in the National Park Skadar Lake
special protected areas. In other words, the area of Boije sestre and Malo blato is habitat of
flora and fauna that can be found in other parts of the Lake, too. The species found in area
of Bolje Sestre are not rare or endangered and they are typical for this kind of the spring.
On the basis of biological analyses of phyto- and zooplankton, microbiological component,
and physicochemical parameters, during the period of July 2005-September 2006, it has
been assessed that the source water quality at the location of the potential water intake,
BoIje sestre in Skadar Lake, is - Al Class, and therefore the source is suitable for water
intake, according to the existing legislation of the Republic of Montenegro.
Considering the maximum water quantity for intake, volume of the Lake will be reduced for
only 0,03%. Estimated water level decrease is app. 2 mm, while the natural annual water
level fluctuation is app. 5 m. However, it is well known that the Lake's water level is
continually recovered due to constant water inflow and precipitation. Maximum impact of 2
mm fluctuation of the water level was calculated under the assumption that during the
summer withdrawal period no water in the lake would be replenished. In reality water will be
replenished, therefore the impact on the water level will be even much less that 2 mm.
Thus, the capturing of the mentioned water quantities would not have any impact on water
level and water quality of the Lake, and the basin in general.
The water temperature of Malo blato almost fully depends on climate conditions and Boije
Sestre has a stable water temperature (vary between 11C in winter and 14°C during
summer). Also, the water at 20 m far from Bolje Sestre spring has temperature same as
water temperature in the middle of Malo Blato, it can be concluded that the impact of the
project on thermal regime of the Malo Blato i.e. Skadar Lake is minimal.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
Impact on the environment caused by using the water from the spring could be evident
through the thermal water regime and amount of water which will be used for the project.
Those parameters are the biological conditions which determinate the biodiversity.
Considering the quantities of water captured for the needs of RWSS and Boije sestre flow
volume, the biological minimum will be provided.
An assessment of the environmental impacts that may result from the construction and
operation of the proposed RWSS has been made in reference to the baseline of the existing
environmental situation. The emphasis is given to the likely significant environmental
impacts, both adverse and beneficial. Temporary, short-term impacts and permanent
effects are considered both for the construction and operational phases.
The table presents the impact on the Boije Sestre source as the microlocation, impact on
the Malo Blato (as a part of the Skadar Lake), and the area of NP Skadar Lake entirely.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
It should be noticed that its most sensitive part - the construction of hydrotechnichal tunnel
Sozina (4,2 km) - is already implemented and requires small-scale reconstruction that will
be undertaken together by agreement with the company "Monteput", which uses this tunnel
as the emergency tunnel of the transportation tunnel Sozina.
It should also be noticed that the most environmentally sensitive areas in the coastal region,
such as: area surrounding Bojana River, Salt Factory in Ulcinj and Solila near Tivat, are not
included in the project. The RWSS concept itself entails water distribution up to the
connection points with the local water supply systems, without entering urban areas. The
pipeline route to the connection point for the future tourist complex at Velika Plaza beach for
the most part follows the main road to Ulcinj and has no significant environmental impact.
The construction of pipeline and accompanying facilities in both Skadar Lake area, i.e.
continental part of the pipeline, and in the coastal region, will not have negative
environmental impact due to implementation of proper protection and implementation
measures, stipulated by project documentation and this study.
The following table provides the state of the environment without RWSS and with the future
RWSS, and the summary of reviewed impacts, as well as some of the protection,
reconstruction and monitoring measures.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
An expert team of the Public Enterprise Skadar Lake NP and an inspection team of the
Ministry in charge of environmental protection and physical planning, within their regular
activities implement environmental monitoring in the area of NP Skadar Lake. In case any
negative impact would be registered, RWSS company must eliminate the impact and
mitigate consequences, in accordance with the institutions of the stated teams.
Environmental inspection team will implement monitoring of both construction and
operational phase in the coastal region of Montenegro.
Public Enterpriseof the NP, reviewed the RWSS project documentation (designs,
investigations results, draft of the EIA, etc.), made opinion that project implementation will
not have negative impact on Skadar lake basin and issued the official approval for the
project.
After the various presentations of the project based on its environmental and economic
aspects have been hold, it can be conclude that the project enjoys significant public support
in providing long-term solution for the water supply of the coastal region of Montenegro,
which will not endanger environmentally sensitive area of Skadar Lake due to foreseen
environmental protection measures.
The benefits of the RWSS of Montenegrin coast are long-term and of great importance for
improving the stability of water supply services. Water quality improvement and new job
opportunities are also major benefits.
As for the Republic, the benefits reflect in the overall economic development - the increase
in production capacities and economic growth, related to the increase in the population
numbers in urban areas, which become more stable in terms of potable water supply.
These benefits are up-to-date, long-term and of great importance.
This project will have major positive impacts on the Montenegrin coast region, especially in
terms of tourism development. Tourism is the main industry in Montenegro, due to
enormous potential and capacity for tourism development primarily in its coastal region.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
1. INTRODUCTION
The water supply problem of Montenegrin Coast has been identified long time ago. The
problem exacerbates in the summer months, causing water shortages that significantly
reduce the economic capacities of the region and the overall quality of the tourist offer.
Five coastal municipalities (Bar, Budva, Kotor, Tivat and Ulcinj) are supplied with water
from local sources, while the municipality of Herceg Novi is supplied from hydrotechnical
system Plat, by the transportation of water across Croatia. Hydrogeological analyses show
that local water sources have almost reached the limits of their capacities, and cannot
provide additional quantities of water during the summer season.
On the other side, the development of coastal region and expansion of tourism capacities
practically depend on the provision of additional water quantities.
As a consequent, during the 70's of the last century, a project on the construction of the
regional water supply system from the unique water source has been initiated, with the aim
of avoiding the risk of potable water shortages in coastal municipalities. Montenegrin Coast
Water Supply Master Plan developed by "Energoprojekt" from Belgrade in 1991 has
defined water source Karuc, in the hinterland of Montenegrin Coast, in the Skadar Lake
basin. It was foreseen that after the system completion each municipality would have one
or more connections to the regional system through which it would supply additional water
quantities. The Final Design for the entire system was completed, as well as the
construction of 38 km long pipeline between Budva and Herceg Novi, with 17000 m3 of
reservoir volume. In addition, hydrotechnical tunnel Sozina, 4,2 km long, was constructed.
Afterwards, the activities stopped due to the crisis our country was hit by in the 90's of the
previous century.
The return of the Republic of Montenegro to the world market, after the end of war in
former SFRY, enabled the recovery of its tourism industry. Since the coastal region of
Montenegro is its most significant area for tourism development, dealing with the basic
infrastructure problems of the area became priority. This has once again made the water
shortages during the peak summer season topical.
In 2005, the Faculty of Economy (Podgorica), in cooperation with the company <(ITSC
Montenegro>>, carried out a (<Cost-benefit analysis of possible solutions for the long-term
water supply of Montenegrin Coast>>. The analysis was made at the request of the
Government of the Republic of Montenegro, with the aim of bringing the final decision on
water source for the regional water supply system of Montenegrin Coast. The initial
assessments and investigations narrowed the selection of water sources to five locations:
Karuc, Bisevina-Boije sestre, Vucko Blato, Tusko Polje and Bojana River. The analysis
elaborated these alternative solutions, and identified the location of Bisevina - Bolje sestre,
in the area of Malo blato, as the most suitable one.
The findings have been confirmed in the independent study carried out by Italian consulting
companies "ERM" and "SWS" during 2005-2006, supported by the World Bank.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
In the period between August and December 2005, an Environmental impact assessment
(EIA) study on the location of water intake for long-term water supply of the Montenegrin
Coast has been prepared, with the aim of ecological evaluation of alternative water supply
solutions defined in the ,,Cost-benefit analysis" - Karuc, Bisevina-Boije sestre and Tusko
polje. The study concludes that, taking into consideration the three examined sources, the
location of Tusko polje does not meet the necessary requirements, and therefore is not
recommended for water intake. Karuc and Bisevina - Boije sestre meet those requirements
and, as such, may be used for the needs of the regional water supply system.
The Cost/benefit analyses concluded that there are two most feasible alternatives for the
source of the Regional Water Supply System: Karuc and Malo Blato basin. In the location
Malo Blato two microlocations have been identified: Boije Sestre spring and Bisevina River.
During the 2005 and 2006 investigation activities conducted at the microlocations Karuc,
Bisevina River and Bolje sestre spring resulted with the conclusion that engineering
requirements, wider area for sanitary protection of the water intake and lower water quality
then the other two alternatives eliminate Bisevina River as the microlocation for the water
intake.
Additional investigations revealed significant advantages of Bolje sestre over Karuc, and
Boije sestre source has been selected for long-term water supply of Montenegrin Coast.
The Preliminary Design has been produced for water intake at this source.
Karuc as the water intake for the RWSS has been included in the Special Plan of the
Republic Montenegro. Inclusion of the Bolje sestre spring in the Spatial Plan of Montenegro
is ongoing process.
The subject EIA study is made upon the request of the Public Enterprise "Regional
Waterworks - Montenegrin Coast" (PEW), and for the needs of the Ministry of
environmental protection and physical planning, the Government of Montenegro and the
World Bank, and will be one of the baseline documents in the preparation of project on
sustainable tourism development in Montenegro (MSTDP), which shall fund the
construction of the regional water supply system.
The main objective of the study is to examine the impact that the construction of regional
water supply system would have on the environment, as well as to propose measures to be
implemented so as to reduce or prevent negative impacts of the project.
The study is based on the Preliminary Design for the continental part of the regional water
supply system, which PEW submitted to the competent public institutions for approval, and
which will be the baseline for the development of the Final Design, as well as for the
existing Final design for the coastal part of the system, in the near future.
The study includes:
* Environmental analysis of Bolje sestre source - as water intake - on the area of
Malo blato and the Skadar Lake basin as a whole;
* Environmental analysis of the pipeline construction in the area of Skadar Lake
basin;
* Environmental analysis of the pipeline consturuction in the coastal region of
Montenegro.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
1.1. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF WATER SOURCES BOLJE SESTRE AND KARUC AND
SELECTION OF THE SOURCE FOR REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN
COAST
At the time when the "Cost-benefit analysis" and ERM/SWS study were developed, the water
source Boije Sestre had not been examined enough, which is why there were certain
dilemmas over the watershed and water quality of this source. Therefore, during 2005 and
2006, with the aim of examining the location of Bolje Sestre as a potential water intake of the
RWSS, PEW financed a number of investigation programs, which included: physicochemical
and microbiological water analyses, geophysical, geoelectric and hydrogeological
investigations, measurement of the water flow, tracing (water-dyeing experiment) Moraca River
flow, as well as underwater filming. At the same time, water quality analyses at Karuc source
were renewed.
The most eminent institutions of the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia
carried out the investigations: Centre for Ecotoxicological Research of Montenegro (CETI) -
Podgorica, National hydrometeorological Service of Montenegro (RHMZ) - Podgorica,
Biological Research Institute "Sinisa Stankovic" - Belgrade, KPI ,,Aquanaut" - Bijela, and
,,Geoprojekt" - Podgorica.
The analyses of the aforementioned investigations' results showed that water source Bolje
sestre has significant advantages over water source Karuc, which can be perceived from the
following table:

Accordingly, at the meeting on September 15, 2006, the Managing Board of PEW adopted
the Decision by which it has chosen Bolje sestre source in Malo blato, in the Skadar Lake
basin, as the location of water intake for RWSS of Montenegrin Coast.
Besides the "Cost-Benefit Analysis" study, another important document - aimed at
implementing the long-term solution for the water supply issue of the Montenegrin Coast -
was adopted in the previous year - the Water Supply Master Plan for the Montenegrin
Coast and municipality of Cetinje. At the meeting at which the latter document was
reviewed, in July 2006, the Government of Montenegro opted for the concept of the RWSS
construction that entails water exploitation from the Skadar lake basin, thus giving the
priority to the stable provision of the public water supply services and greater safety of
system operation in all conditions.
1.2. WATER DEMAND AND RWSS CAPACITY
The "Cost-Benefit Analysis" estimated long-term water demand, taking into consideration
the following criteria:
1.    Projected increase in the population numbers in the coastal municipalities;
2.    Specific daily consumption per inhabitant;
3.    Water supply network coverage;
4.    Accommodation capacities in hotels and other tourist facilities;
5.    Water demand fluctuations throughout the year;
6.    Other consumers;
7.    Water losses in local water supply networks.
The investigations focused on the southern region of Montenegro, covering the territories
of the municipalities of Herceg Novi, Kotor, Budva, Tivat, Bar and Ulcinj. According to the
last Census (2003), the number of inhabitants in this area was around 170.000. This
number significantly increases in the peak tourist season.
This area is supplied with potable water from local water sources exclusively, with the
exception of the municipality of Herceg Novi, which supplies from the hydrotechnical
system Plat in the tourist season. Since these sources are in their hydrological minimum
during the tourist season - when the water demand is at its highest level - water shortages
occur in the entire area, and last up to 20 hours per day.

ERM/SWS study also reveals significant deficiency in water quantities, presented in the
following table:
Year           2010     2015    2028     2033
Deficit (I/s)  -784    -805     -1259    -1449
Although the Water Supply Master Plan estimates considerably lower long-term water
demands, its optimistic scenario of the Montenegrin coast development unfolds in the
deficiency in water totalling 889 I/s in 2028.
The findings of the aforementioned studies lead to the conclusion that deficiency in water
persists in the analyzed period and varies between 35 % in 2010 to app. 45 % u 2033.
Therefore, it is envisaged for the RWSS to have maximum capacity of 1500 I/s, where at
the source itself water capturing is planned in two phases:
* 1000 I/s in the beginning (to meet the demands at least until 2020),
* additional 500 I/s in the 2nd phase.
1.3. DESCRIPTION OF THE RWSS
RWSS of the Montenegrin Coast consist of the two subsystems:
1. Continental part;
2. Coastal part;

The overview of the RWSS
The continental part stretches from  the water intake Boije sestre, through the
hydrotechnical tunnel Sozina, to reservoir ,,Djurmani", the main water storage tank in the
system. The route partly stretches over the Skadar Lake area.
The coastal part is divided into southern and northern branch. The northern branch, 73 km
long, stretches from the reservoir ,Djurmani" to the municipalities of Budva, Kotor, Tivat
and Herceg Novi. The southern branch, totalling 34 km of length, is envisaged for the water
supply of the municipalities of Bar and Ulcinj.
Administratively, the RWSS pipeline route passes across the territories of the municipalities
of Podgorica, Bar, Ulcinj, Budva, Kotor, Tivat and Herceg Novi. The locations of all the
system facilities and pipeline connections are presented in the general scheme of the
RWSS facilities, given in the Appendix (Drawing I)
1.3.1. THE CONTINENTAL PART OF THE RWSS
According to the solution, the water captured at the source is transported via gravity
pipeline to the pumping station water tank located near the water capture site. From
pumping station (PS), the water is transported via pressure pipelines to the break pressure
chambers (BPC) 1 and 2, near the water intake, positioned in a way that enables gravity

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
The lower Chamber 1 provides 1.000 I/s of water flow, equalling the planned system
capacity in the I Phase, while higher Chamber 2provides 1.500 I/s of water flow, i.e. for the
needs of the 11 Phase.
The continental part of the RWSS consists of the following facilities:
1. Water production facility (WPF) Boije sestre;
2. Gravity pipeline from the WPF Bolje sestre to the PS ,,Reljici";
3. PS,,Reljici";
4. Pipeline from the PS ,,Reljici" to the reservoir ,,Djurmani";
5. Reservoir,,Djurmani".
1.3.1.1. WPF BOLJE SESTRE
The construction of the following facilities in the water source area is planned:
* Water intake plant with a dam made of concrete over which excess amounts of
water flow into Malo blato,
* Pumping stations,
* Laboratories for water quality analyses,
* Personnel building,
* Desinfection of water,
* Pressure pipeline from pumping station to break pressure chambers 1 and 2,
* Break pressure chambers 1 and 2,
*  Access road to WPF,
*  Power distribution sub-station for power supply of the WPF.
According to the National Law even the waters of the highest quality have to be disinfected
but the Law does not command the type of disinfection. The water quality on the source is
extremely good but considering the safety that have to be reached for the next 27 km of the
pipeline, (until the reservoir Djurmani) it is necessary to install disinfection system at the
source. UV disinfection is recommended because there are no connections during the
pipeline route of 27 km so it does not require the residual disinfection medium in water
because, the secondary contamination is unlikely. The concept is to keep the quality of
water on the same level (class Al) along the whole RWSS and to avoid use of chemicals.
1.3.1.2. GRAVITY PIPELINE FROM WPF BOLJE SESTRE TO PS aRELJICh)
In some sections, the gravity pipeline from the BPC 1 and 2 to the PS "Reljici" is designed
as a parallel pipeline of DN800 and DN700, while in other sections, single pipeline is
designed as pipeline of DN1000, only where due to the lack of space the installation of two
pipelines was not possible.

Gravity pipeline is around 20,2 km long. The length of the pipeline section with the two
parallel pipes is app. 15,3 km, while the section with the DN1000 pipes is around 4,9 km
long. The pipeline mainly runs along the local roads and partly down the bottom of Malog
blata, i.e. Skadar Lake. The total designed length of the pipeline at the bottom of Malo
Blato is around 1,5 km. The pipelines are made of polyester (GRP), SN5000, and nominal
pressure 10 bar. This pipe material is suitable in the view of both installation and good
hydraulic characteristics. In addition, it also guarantees the conservation of organoleptic
features of potable water
In the section of the pipeline route at the bottom of Skadar Lake, i.e. Malo blato, the
pipeline will be anchored with blocks made of concrete that will prevent its surfacing and fix
its position.
In the dry terrain, the pipeline will be installed at minimum 80 cm above the pipe's apex.
In the sections at the bottom of the Lake, the grade line shall follow the natural bottom of
the Lake.
1.3.1.3. PUMPING STATION (RELJICIh AND PIPELINE FROM PS TO RESERVOIR ,,DJURMANI"
PS ,,Reljici" pumps the water through the hydrotechnical tunnel ,,Sozina" and then to the
reservoir ,,Djurmani". It is located in the bottom of Sozina Mountain, close to the Skadar
Lake National Park.
The pipeline from the PS ,,Reljici" to the reservoir "Djurmani" is 6.000 m long.
The initial 1000 m of the route, the pipeline is laid in the hilly terrain covered with forest and
shrubs. After this section, a 4200 m long pipeline passes through already constructed
hydrotechnical tunnel ,,Sozina". Through the tunnel single polyester pipeline of DN 1100
mm will be installed at fixed and sliding props in the tunnel. The pipeline contains a water
chamber, aimed at maintaining the pressure in the system and protecting the pipeline in
case of disconnection of the PS "Reljici".
At around 800m from the tunnel exit, the pipeline ends at the entrance of the reservoir
,,Djurmani".
1.3.1.4. RESERVOIR <(DJURMANI))
Reservoir ((Djurmani)), already built, volume capacity of 10.000 m3, represents the main
water storage tank for both branches of the RWSS southern part, redirecting water
depending on consumer demand. In terms of altitude, the facility is defined by heights of
the overflow and bottom 196/191m.a.s.l. The reservoir is located at around 800 m from the
exit of the hydrotechnical tunnel Sozina, and is comprised of three facilities: two reservoir
chambers for water storage with the capacity of 5.000 m3 each, with valve chambers for
storing hydromechanical and electric equipment, and chlorination station with an annexe -
made of reinforced concrete - for storage/neutralization of chlorine.
All construction works at the reservoir Durmani have been performed. The reservoir is
planned to be used with existing capacity of 10 000 m3. Activities will be related to the
reconstruction and providing of the waterproofing.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
This regulation stipulates hygienic quality of potable water used for public water
supply or food production.
The water complying with the standards stipulated by this regulation in terms of
microbiological, physicochemical and radiological composition is hygienically suitable
potable water quality.
Standards, or maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of parameters are given in
the table along with the standards set forth in the EU Directive 98/83/EC and
standards of World Health Organization, defined in Geneva in 1993. (Table 2-1).
2.11. EUROPEAN WATER LEGISLATION
The existing national water legislation comprising of: Regulation on water
classification and categorization (Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro
No.15/97), Regulation on wastewater quality and discharge into public sewage
network (Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro No.10/97), and Regulation on
hygienic quality of potable water (The Official Gazette of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, No. 42/98) mainly complies with relevant MPC defined by the related EU
Directives.
The Directive relating to the quality of surface water to be used for potable water
production is 75/440/EEC. The aim of the Directive is to provide the appropriate
quality of these waters so as to use them as sources of potable water.
The EU Directive 98/83/EC, defining quality of water for human consumption, is
adopted in 1998, and complies with the existing national Regulation on hygienic
validity of potable water in Montenegro.
The table below provides the MPC values according to the existing national and
European legislation.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
3. BASELINE DATA
Considering the concept of the regional water supply system of the coastal region of
Montenegro, the project may be divided into: inland part - encompassing the Skadar
Lake Basin, and Montenegrin Coast.
3.1. SKADAR LAKE BASIN
3.1.1. SKADAR LAKE
Skadar Lake is located in karsts terrain of the southern part of Dinaric Alps. It is the
largest lake in the Balkans. It is situated in the Zeta-Skadar Valley, in the far southeast
part of Montenegro. It is a border lake and its smaller part is located in the territory of
Albania. It is encircled with the Zeta Plain in the west, and with the slopes of Lovcen,
Sutorman, Rumija and Tarabos Mountains in the southwest. In the east and
northeast, in Albania, it adjoins Skadar Lowland.
Surface area of the Lake fluctuates from 254 2, at water level of 4.71 meters above the
sea level (herein after: m.a.s.l.), to 506 kM2, at water level of 9.8 m.a.s.l. At maximum
water level, maximum depth of the Lake is 12 m, while at its minimum water level it is
8 m deep. These facts show significant changes in the water volume of the lake and
its water level that varies from 5 to 10 m.a.s.l.
Skadar Lake Basin is a part of the Adriatic Sea Watershed in the territory of
Montenegro. The basin covers the area of around 5490 kM2, out of which app. 4460
km2 (81,2%) belongs to the territory of Montenegro, while around 1030 km2 (18%)
belongs to the territory of Albania. The Montenegrin part of the Skadar Lake Basin
belongs to the southeast and southern parts of the central region of Montenegro. In
the south and southwest it borders Montenegrin Coast watershed, in the west the
River Tribisnjica Basin, in the northwest and north the River Piva Basin and in the
northeast it borders River Tara and River Lim Basins. The mountains in the watershed
area - Njegos, Lovcen, Rumija, etc - represent the most distinctive karsts
phenomenon in the world and are composed of typical limestone and dolomites.
Carbonates make 80% of the basin. Basin area is rich in karst fields, inlets, sinkholes,
caves and various microforms of caves.
Skadar Lake Basin itself is the remainder of a sea bay that existed at the end of
Miocene and in the beginning of Pliocene. As a result of geotectonic movements,
fresh water activities and Quaternary rocks sedimentation, the connection with the sea
was disrupted, and afterwards the fresh water lake was created. Its lowest parts are
below the sea level. At the water level of 5 m.a.s.l., the maximum lake depth is 8 m.
The relief of the lake trough is disturbed by deep morphological depressions, funnel
shaped cavities, deep up to 60 m. The cavities are numerous and linked to almost
every ground source.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
The shoreline length of the lake is 207 km, out of which 149,5 km belongs to the
territory of Montenegro. The shore is rather jagged. Karst hummocks in the lake
trough are known as islands Starcevo, Beska, Moracnik, Gradac, Tophala, Gorica,
Gljat, etc. The most notable bays are located near the springs of Stitar, Bugovista,
Gljac, Muric, Radusko. The largest bay is Hotski bay in the northern part of the lake,
which is equally divided in two by the Albanian border.
Malo blato is a separate water basin out of which water continually flows into Skadar
Lake, and at high water level it looks like the lake's gulf. Malo blato drains into
Bisevina River, which after meeting Segrtnica River creates Karatuna River. Karatuna
receives the flows of Bazagurska Matica under Prevlaka peninsula and then flows into
River Crnojevica. The most important Skadar Lake tributaries are Moraca, Karatuna,
Bazagurska matica, Crnojevica, Orahovstica and Crmnicka Rivers. The lake receives
significant amounts of flow from smaller rivers that drain into Zeta Plain. Numerous
underwater sources, so called "vrulje", also flow into Skadar Lake. In the Hotski Bay
area the most significant underwater sources are Ploca, Vitoja and Funija. There is a
large number of underwater sources and springs in Malo blato area, too, and the most
important are Bolje sestre, Biotsko oko, Brodic, Crno oko, Donja krakala, Bobovik, etc.
Malo blato as a part of the Skadar Lake has typical characteristics regarding
biodiversity, geomorphology, hydrogeology, thermal regime, etc as the Skadar Lake
as a whole. In this area, there are no registered rare or endangered species. In that
sense this Study analyzed the Skadar Lake as the sensitive wider environment and
the Bolje sestre spring as the microlocation.
Malo blato is a separate water basin, but also part of the Skadar Lake and belong to
the protected area of the Skadar Lake National Park. It is located in the karst
depression, in the northern part of Skadar Lake Basin, with which it is hydrologically
connected by Bisevina River, its outflow. Sinjacka River, karst sources that drain
through numerous springs along eastern, northern and western shores, as well as
precipitation provide inflow to Malo blato. At high water levels, most of the shore
sources are submerged under the lake water. The only outflow of Malo blato is
Bisevina River, located in its southwest shore.
In the Karuc area the most significant ground sources are Volac, Karuc, Djurovo oko,
Kaludjerovo oko. Along the southwest shore surrounding mountains drain into copious
ground sources, such as: Modra oka, Radusko oko, Krnjicko oko, etc.
The abundance of precipitation also contributes to the water richness of this area.
Average annual precipitation is over 2330 mm. River Moraca exerts the greatest
influence on water volume of Skadar Lake. It provides 62% of total inflow.
Skadar Lake outflows by Bojana River with a mean annual flow of 322 m3/s.

3.1.2. BOLJE SESTRE - AREA DESCRIPTION
The three-dimensional (3D) overview of the position of water source Bolje sestre at
the digital relief model of its wider surroundings is presented at the picture below.
Water source Bolje sestre drains out of the stratified dolomite limestone from
Cretaceous in the northeast shore of Malo blato, below the western sides of Kolozub
Mountain (220 m above sea level) inclining northeast under angle 280. In the dry
period of the year, the waters of the Bolje Sestre flow out in a wide stretch at the level,
and in a more significant part below the water table level of Malo Blato - under
pressure out of 7-8 m depth. Bolje Sestre is a ,,broken" water source, since the water
flows out in the 25 m long stretch, with the two most abundant sources on which the
water will be caught for the needs of the project. For most part of the year the water
source is submerged under the lake water.

Source Bolje Sestre panoramic view
Considering the outflow mechanism, the capacity of this source is difficult to
determine precisely. The measurement has been performed by a hydrometer wings.
However, it is estimated that in the hydrological minimum the capacity is 2-3 m3Is.
According to the recent measurements, performed by National Hydrometeorological
Service of Montenegro - Hydrology Department, with current meter, the following
flows have been determined as a precise data:
*  On August 23, 2005, the water flow was 2,69 m3Is. Since the natural conditions
at the location prevented measurement of all the flows of the water source, it was
estimated that, beside the measured profile, there were around 300 I/s of the flow,
so the total water flow was estimated at around 3 m3/s.
*  On August 2, 2006, the water flow was 2,36 m3/s. The measurement took place
in specific conditions due to certain deceleration of the groundwater flow in its
contact with the waters of Malo Blato. These conditions reduced flow velocity at
the measured profile, thus it has been estimated that the results on the water flow
are around 10 to 15 % lower than the real ones.
* On September 13, 2006, the water flow was 2,34 m3/s.
Considering the hydrological time of year when the measurements were carried out,
and which included hydrological minimum and the distinctive exploit period of the
regional water supply system, the capacity of 2,34 m3/s has been accepted as a
representative for water source Bolje Sestre. The same conclusion was drawn in few
earlier studies (Radulovic, M.: Karst Hydrogeology of Montenegro, Podgorica, 1981.)
Due to complicated outflow mechanism of the source, the measurement may result
with an error of +-1 0%. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the minimal capacity of
the source (in september-october) is higher than 2 m3/sec and that during its

The wider surrounding of the lake is composed of typical forms of karst, limestone and
dolomite rocks, and descending in slopes towards Skadar Lake Basin. From the east
and west side, the lake is confined with two karst bars. Hilly terrain surrounding the
lake from three sides is covered with scarce and short vegetation. The southern brim
of the lake is open and occasionally transforms into floodplain, towards Zabljak
Village.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
Rich marsh vegetation grows in muddy deposits of River Sinjacka, around its delta.
The vegetation is present along the shallow southern shore, too. During the
investigation period that included all four distinctive periods of the year, no typical lake
submersed or floating vegetation had been noticed.
Wider surrounding area of the lake is scarcely populated. There are neither
permanent settlements nor infrastructure on its shores. There is only a small village
Filipov krs, with 5-6 households and a few vacation houses on its southwest shore.
On the northern side of the lake, facing fanlike towards Ljesanska nahija, there are
Sinjac and Goljemadi Villages with a small number of inhabitants practicing traditional
activities of the hither population, such as agriculture and fishery. Further north there
is settlement Barutana, beside which passes high traffic density highway Podgorica-
Cetinje.
Other villages are located on the opposite side of the highway, at the fanlike side of
the valley. Their sparse population breeds small farm animals, cultivates garden
vegetables and grapes. All the villages have developed transport infrastructure.
Narrow flat stretch on the right shore of Moraca River (Vukovci, Grbavci, Lekici,
Farmaci Villages), in between of the eastern hilly boundary of Malo blato and Moraca
River, is far more populated, and its inhabitants work in agriculture.
All year long, particularly during the season, local population is engaged in fishery,
using small wooden boats with vanbrodski engine.
There is no industrial activity in the area surrounding Malo blato and Bolje sestre,
which is very important for protection of the source.
Malo blato is navigable only for small boats and powerboats, due to shallowness of its
only outflow - Bisevina River - at low water levels.
3.1.3. HYDROLOGY OF SKADAR LAKE
Average annual precipitation in the Skadar Lake basin varies from 1750 mm to 3250
mm, depending on the location. Due to abundance of precipitation (over 2000 mm
annually) in Skadar Lake, watershed has remarkable inflow. River Moraca is the most
important tributary (mean flow 175 m3/s) and it provides over 50% of the total inflow.
On the other side, Skadar Lake oufflows by Bojana River with average flow of 322
m3/s. The lake and river together create one unique system.

Nowadays, this subtropical lake lays 5m above sea level and has drainage basin area
covering 5490 kM2, of which 4460 km2 belongs to the territory of Montenegro.
The total watershed area of the Skadar Lake is 5490 km2 with average precipitation of
2328 mm. Average cumulative amount of precipitation on the watershed area is
12.776 x 106 m3. Annual oufflow is 322 m3/s, which equals 10.154 x 106 m3/per year.
The difference between these two values is in the evaporation, which is around 20%
of the total water quantity.
It is important to highlight that Skadar Lake volume varies between 2 to 4 billion of
cubic meters. Considering the annual water inflow and outflow, it has been calculated
that water retention time is merely 2 to 4 months. This fact could be the best
explanation for the non-existence of eutrophication in the Skadar Lake.

Bojana River is Skadar Lake's outflow. Bojana flows about 18 km through Albanian
territory and in its upstream flow it represents border river between Montenegro and
Albania, in the length of approximately 25 km. In the downstream flow of the lake, at
approximately 1 - 2 km, River Drim flows into River Bojana with the river basin area of
13000 km2. At high water levels, Drim decelerates the outflow from the lake and
sometimes water from Drim River partially flows into the lake.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
3.1.4. THERMAL WATER REGIME OF SKADAR LAKE
Thermal conditions in Skadar Lake result from the climate of the existing geographic
setting. All the available data suggest that Moraca River is major factor of the northern
part of Skadar Lake's physical limnology. Its inflow is rather important for thermal
conditions.
Seasonal changes in the thermal cycle of Skadar Lake are followed by changes in the
air temperature. Comparison of air and water temperatures shows that during the
autumn, the mean air temperature is app. 10C lower than the minimum water
temperature. During the winter, the mean air temperature and the minimum water
temperature are the same. In the spring, the air heats more rapidly than the lake and
average air temperature is close to the maximum water temperature. In the summer,
the mean air temperature is 2-3°C lower than the maximum water temperature, due to
rapid heating of shallow water on very hot days. During the investigation period from
1972 to 1977, water temperature was not below 5°C, and in the summer time, it did
not exceed 300C. According to the examinations conducted in the last five years
(2000 - 2005) by RHMZ and CETI, maximum water temperature in the summer time
was between 300C and 400C, while air temperature was around 400C. The highest
temperatures were recorded near the lakeshores, especially in large macrophytes
beds.

Temperatures of Moraca River's inflow waters were much lower than the lake water
temperatures and its influence is marked as positive, especially in the summer time
when it causes cooling down of the lake body. This influence is evident at inflow
armlet in the north, south of Vranjine village.
Thermal regime of Skadar Lake is under the influence of Sun and morphology, while
influence of tributaries, except Moraca River, is minor. About 80% of the lake is 3m
deep. The mean depth is 5m and maximum is around 8m. In these conditions,
epilimnion does not exist; water body is almost evenly heated and the deepest water
layers are within the isotherm frame of 250C. Moraca River, at its inflow point, and as
a fresh and cool river, has the greatest thermal influence. The main effect Moraca
River exerts is the water change in the lake basin.
The system of water Malo blato has similar thermal regime to the thermal regime of
Skadar Lake.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
Temperatures of the source of Boije sestre vary between 11C in winter and 14°C
during summer. This implies that air temperature has no influence on water
temperature of the source, and that water temperature of the source's inflows and
temperature of geological surroundings of the source have dominant influence on the
water temperature of the source.
The fact that water temperature of Boije sestre is stable also leads to the conclusion
that there is no hydrological connection between Moraca River and the source, which
has been confirmed during the investigations that included comparative analysis of
physicochemical parameters of Moraca River and Bolje sestre flows (conducted
between November 2005 and February 2006 by National Hydrometeorological
Service of Montenegro). During the measurements, the difference in temperatures of
Moraca River and Bolje sestre flows was up to 4°C, which considering small
geographic distance and same climate corresponds to the abovementioned
conclusion.
Thermal regime of Malo blato matches the thermal regime of Skadar Lake. This
implies that water temperature of Malo blato almost fully depends on climate
conditions, while the influence of numerous sources and underwater sources - with
considerably lower summer water temperatures - is negligible, except in the closest
surrounding of the source. The surface area of Malo blato, which totals app. 8 km2 in
its hydrological minimum, its average depth of 3m, as well as the long water retention
period in this part of the lake and its slow flowing into Bisevina River causes the water
to heat evenly, and the deepest layers to be in the same isothermal frame and depend
on solar radiation.
In the following table are presented water temperature of the Malo Blato and Bolje
Sestre spring are presented. It can be concluded that the water temperature of Malo
blato almost fully depends on climate conditions and that Bolje Sestre has a stable
water temperature.
TABLE 3-3 - WATER TEMPERATURE (°C) OF MALO BLATO AND BOLJE SESTRE, ACCORDING TO THE RHMZ AND CETI DATA

-27.02.2006.  11.3               10.0                 13.1
Regarding the mentioned data and the fact that the water of Malo Blato even 20 m
away from Bolje Sestre spring, has the same temperature as the water temperature in
the middle of Malo Blato, it can be concluded that the impact of the project on thermal
regime of the Malo Blato i.e. Skadar Lake is minimal.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOL1E SESTRE
3.1.5. WATER QUALITY
Water quality analyses are performed at nine profiles from May to November.
According to the Law on water classification and categorization, Skadar Lake is A2, C
11 Class. Considering the relatively dense traffic and pollution, the total water quality is
satisfactory and within the legally stipulated values. There are no visible waste
materials, except for the common residues of the lake flora. In accordance with the
legally stipulated values, lake water is more often higher quality than the stipulated for
Al and A2 Classes. The exception is Virpazar area, where ammonium concentration
often exceeds the stipulated values for the aforementioned class, and in which the
values of microbiological parameters match A3 Class.
Water quality analyses at the source of Bolje sestre includes period from November
2005 to August 2006, and are performed by RHMZ (Podgorica), CETI (Podgorica)
and Biological Research Institute "Sinisa Stankovic"(Belgrade).
3.1.5.1. PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS
Two independent laboratories (RHMZ and CETI) carried out physicochemical and
microbiological water analyses, and sampling covered each of the four different
hydrological periods of the year. The performance of these analyses was in
compliance with the scope stipulated by Regulation on hygienic quality of potable
water (The Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro, No. 42/98), for study and
research activities at new water intakes.
The following elaboration deals with the water quality at the water source Boije sestre,
and is based on the parameters that deviate from maximum permitted concentration
values during the abovementioned period, while other parameters are constantly
within the permitted limits, and below stipulated MPC values or even below the
sensitivity level of the devices.
* Arsenic: MPC value for Arsenic is 0,01 mg/I, maximum measured value of
Arsenic <0.01 mg/I, which shows that the value is below the sensitivity level of
the devices.
*  Cadmium: MPC values for Cadmium is 0,001 mg/I, maximum measured value
of Cadmium is <0,001 mg/I, which shows that the value is below the sensitivity
level of the devices. (Cadmium values according to EU Directive is 0.005mg/I)
*  Selenium: MPC values for Selenium is 0,01 mg/I, maximum measured value of
Selenium is <0,01 mg/I, which shows that the value is below the sensitivity level
of the devices.
*  Mercury: Maximum measured value of Mercury is <0.001 mg/I, meaning below
the sensitivity level of devices, but with deviation from MPC value which is
0,0005 mg/l. (Mercury value according to EU Directive is 0.001 mg/I)
*  Cyanide: Maximum measured value of Cyanide is <0.01 mg/I, meaning below

*  Phosphates: MPC value of Phosphates is 0,08 mg/I, maximum measured value
is <0,120 mg/I, which is also below the sensitivity level of devices.
*  Phenols: MPC for Phenols is 0.001 mg/I, maximum measured value of phenols
is >0,001 mg/l, which shows that the value is below the sensitivity level of
devices.
*  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: MPC value of PAH is 0, 0002 mg/I, maximum
measured value of PAH is <0,0002 mg/I, which shows that the value is below
the sensitivity level of devices.
*  Mineral Oils: MPC of mineral oils is not stipulated by the Directive from 1996,
but the Regulation on hygienic validity of potable water (The Official Gazette of
the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, No. 33/87 stipulates the MPC of
mineral oils 0,01 mg/l. Maximum measured value of mineral oils is <0,01 mg/I,
which shows that the value is below the sensitivity level of devices.
*  Other parameters: All the other parameters do not exceed the MPC values, and
their registered values in the aforementioned period of time are constantly within
the normal limits and in compliance with the Regulation.
According to the Directive on water classification and categorization, and from this
elaboration it may be concluded that, in terms of physicochemical parameters, water
at Bolje sestre matches Al, S, meaning 1 st Class water quality.
The analyses of microbiological parameters have found the following:
*  Faecal coli form bacteria: MPC for Faecal coli form bacteria is 20 per 100 ml of
water. These bacteria are registered twice, and the measured values did not
exceed the MPC values. Maximum measured value was - 7.
*  Total coli form bacteria: MPC for total coli form bacteria is 50 per 100 ml of
water. At Boije sestre these bacteria are registered twice, and the measured
values exceeded the MPC values. Maximum measured value was - 231.
*  Faecal streptococci: MPC for faecal streptococci is 20 in 100mI of water, and
the measured values did not exceed MPC values. Maximum measured value
was - 6, in other cases it was either 0 or has not been registered at all.
*  Proteus types: MPC for Proteus types is none in 1000 or 5000 ml of water.
These types were not registered.
*  Pseudomonas aeruginosa: MPC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not stipulated
by the Directive, but according to the Regulation hygienic validity of potable
water it is 0 in 1 00mI of water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not registered.
* Aerobic heterotrophic bacteria: Maximum  measured value of aerobic
heterotrophic bacteria at the source of Bolje sestre was 276 in 1 ml of water in
August and 230 in January 2006.
*  Salmonella types: Salmonella types have not been registered not once during
the water quality analyses performed in 2006.

In terms of microbiological parameters water quality at source Bolje sestre matches Al,
S, meaning 1st Class water quality, according to the Directive on water classification
and categorization. Water quality at Bolje sestre source is constantly good and is
subject to the strict standards for potable water and water supply system.
3.1.5.2. RADIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS
Water analyses at Bolje sestre source involved radiological analyses as well.
Radiological analyses were performed by Centre for Ecotoxicological Research of
Montenegro, at July 4, 2006.
The analyses covered natural radionuclide 40K, 226Ra, 232Th, 235U and 238U.
Values for artificial radionuclides Cs137 and Sr90 were also given. Due to very low
concentration of some radionuclides, the latter could not be detected, even though the
samples were concentrated. These values were given as minimum detectible activity,
and are individually specified in the following table.
40K (mBq/l)  137Cs    226Ra      232Th      235U      238u       9Sr (mBq/1)

The performed analysis has shown that the activity of all the analysed radionuclides in
the given sample was below permitted values, and in compliance with the provisions
stipulated by Regulation on limitations of radioactive contamination of the environment
and guidelines for decontamination process (The Official Gazette of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia No. 9/99). In terms of radiological validity the sample is
satisfactory.
3.1.5.3. HYDROBIOLOGICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL ASPECT
The report "Water quality at the potential water intake Boije sestre, Malo blato, Skadar
Lake - Hydrobiological and microbiological aspect", produced by Biological Research
Institute "Sinisa Stankovic", Belgrade, in July 2006, represents summary of
investigations conducted by eminent experts, in order to assess water quality at the
potential water intake area of Bolje sestre in the Skadar Lake basin on the basis of
biological analysis of phyto- and zooplanktons and analysis of microbiological
components.
Plankton investigations serve for:

Measurement in situ and samples were taken at the main source. The water level was
low. Depth of the source in the colder period of year varies between 1,5 to 2 m, and in
the summer it decreases at around 0,5m. Currently, the depth is less than 0,5m. Air
temperature during the sampling was 33,20C, and water temperature was 13,10C.
Main source bed was covered over with moss. Water turbidity is low.
In the water of Bolje sestre source, in the qualitative uncondensed sample from July
2006, only the silicate algae - Bacillariophyceae was registered. These algae are
qualitatively predominant, while the presence of other species, such as
Chrysophyceae and Chlorophyceae, is low. Predominantly organisms from moss -
which covers the source bed - were found in the source water, whereas the presence
of lake water flora was rather low. The species found are not rare or endangered and
they are typical for this kind of the spring.
Qualitative composition of phytoplankton community
The typical plankton forms registered were colonies from genus of Dinobryon, class
Chrysophyceace.

During sampling, typical plankton forms of the dominant Bacillariophyceae class were
not found, while the presence of benthic, phytophylic and epiphytic forms was
registered. These included various genera forms, such as: Melosira, Amphora,
Achnanthes, Diatoma, Cocconeis, Gyrosigma, Synedra, Cymbella, Gomphonema,
Navicula and Nitzchia. In the source area, at future water intake location, the bed is
covered with moss and algae from class Chrysophyceae. Periphyton forms, species
from genera Spirogyra and Ulothrix were also present, as well as Closterium
ehrenbergi species belonging to Desmidiales class - the class of desmid green algae.
In the free source water, in plankton, as free-floating forms, algae species originating
from Periphyton are found, from the moss, as well as the species from the source bed
from rocks and pieces of wood found in water.

Determininq chlorophyll-a concentration (conc. Chi a - uin/dm3), as a measure
for produced biomass of plankton plant component
Chlorophyll a concentration (conc. Chi a - pg/dM3), as a measure for produced
biomass of plankton plant component, determined on from the 3-litre sample, was
below the sensitivity level of method - 1 pg/dm3 (ISO 10260, 1992; hot ethanol
extraction).
The quantity of detritus from the adjacent terrestrial vegetation is minimal.
Qualitative composition of zooplankton communit,
During the water sampling at Bolje sestre source, in concentrated qualitative sample,
the presence of only two species were registered - from Rotatoria group - Keratella
cohlearis and Colurella adriatica. Such findings were expected considering the type of
aquatic system - spring water.
Quantitative composition of zooplankton community represented as number of
individuals per volume unit (number of individuals/dm3)
No zooplankton organisms, nor their residuals, were found in the 5 litre sample - 0
ind./5 dm3. The amount of detritus is minimal.
Selection of the most abundant forms, with dimensions, in order to estimate the
filter opening size of microscreens in WTP
Selection of the most abundant forms of zooplankton, with dimensions, in order to
estimate the filter opening size of microscreens in WTP was not possible since in the
quantitative sampling no organisms were found (0 ind./5 dm3).
During determining the saprobity degree according to Liebmann, it was found that
organisms, algae and zooplankton, present in qualitative sampling, are indicators of
xenosaprobity, oligosaprobity, beta-oligosaprobity,  beta-mesosaprobity, which
classifies water at Bolje sestre source as clean water.
Determining the saprobity degree by calculating saprobity index S according to
Pantle-Buck was not possible due to extremely low number of organisms.
Hydrobiological investigations show that:
On the basis of Chlorophyll-a analysis as a measure of algae produced biomass,
according to OECD (1982) and Felfoldy (1980), the trophy is the zone of
ultraoligotrophy (<1 pg/dim3), which implies very low productive aquatic ecosystem.
Saprobiological analysis revealed saprobity status in oligosaprobity zone, which
implies that water at Bolje sestre source is clean 1 st Class.
The selection of the most abundant forms of phyto- and zooplankton, with the
dimensions, in order to estimate the filter opening size of microscreens in WTP was
not possible since in the quantitative sampling no organisms were found.

Microbiological investigations show that:
Water at Boije sestre source belongs to 1st Class according to Kohl, or 1st B and very
clean waters according to the Phosphate activity index (solvency according to lFA
0,07).
Lipolytic bacteria, indicators of organic substances of lipid origin, are registered in a
negligible number. There are no bacteria signifying the presence of protein and
carbohydrate pollutants (mono- and polysaccharides).
The relation between the number of facultative oligotrophs and heterotrophs implies
acceptable self-treatment capacity of water at Bolje sestre source - self-treatment
level 4,8.
A great number of bacteria from genus Leptothrix- concentrations of Fe and Mn in the
bacterioflora are found in the examined water sample.
All species found at the source are typical for the sources with similar quality of water
as the water of Bolje sestre spring and they can be found at the other sources along
the Skadar lake coast. None of the mentioned species is protected or endangered.
On the basis of biological analyses of phyto- and zooplankton and microbiological
component, it has been assessed that the source water quality at the location of the
potential water intake, Bolje sestre in Skadar Lake, in July 2006, was - Al Class, and
therefore the source is suitable for water intake, according to the existing legislation of
the Republic of Montenegro.
Source capture would eliminate all algae species coming from the moss covers or free
lake water and/or watershed, which cannot survive without light, even though at this
moment, considering only one sample set, we cannot foresee their number or the
pressure their residuals would have on screens in WTP.
3.1.6. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT BOLJE SESTRE SOURCE
Beside physicochemical and microbiological water quality analysis, the following
investigations have also been performed at Bolje Sestre source:
1. Water flow measurement at the water source,
2. Tracing - Water-dyeing experiment at Moraca River,
3. Underwater filming of Boije Sestre water source and Moraca River Abyss,
4. Geophysical investigation of the location,
5. Geoelectric investigation of the Moraca River alluvium,
6. Hydrogeological investigations.
The investigations were aimed at determining watershed of the source, defining
possible pollution factors of the source and stipulating protection measures.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
Geophysical and hydrogeological investigations at the area between Malo blato and
Moraca River have been performed in three phases:
*  I Phase included karst terrains east of Malo blato (above Boije sestre source, a
part of terrain in the Grbavci village area)
*  II Phase included lowland terrains between Grbavci and River Moraca
watercourse (geoelectric tomography)
*  III Phase involved testing of geophysical investigation results by borehole
drilling investigation at the lowland part of Grbavci village.
On the basis of geophysical and hydrogeological investigations and experiments
performed between Malo blato and Moraca, the following conclusions may be drawn:
*  Water source Bolje Sestre receives part of the flow from the narrow
groundwater course Grbavci formed in glaciofluvial sediments, which in the
direction of the groundwater course determined by geoelectric scanning and
investigative borehole drilling have good filtration characteristics. It is a part of
the narrow groundwater course with free water level, which infiltrates into
carbonate rocks of the eastern side of Kolozub and drains in the level and
below the level of Malo Blato waters. The results of chemical analysis carried
out at the same time on samples from the wells in Grbavci and this water
source, as well as the hydrological inclination of the narrow groundwater
course from borehole BG1 to borehole BG2, have proven that water source
Bolje Sestre receives part of the flow from the narrow groundwater course
Grbavci.
*  Underwater source Bolje Sestre receives part of the flow from the narrow
groundwater course from the direction of Grbavci-Kolozub, discovered by the
electromagnetic and geoelectric tomographic investigations (below quaternary
glaciofluvial deposits and transitory clay layer, there are cretaceous limestone
within which the karst spring is under pressure. For these reasons, the water
at Boije Sestre drains mainly below the level of Malo Blato waters, which is
easy to determine by the bubbles that water creates flowing out under
pressure from the bottom of this phenomenon, which is app. 8 m deep.)
*  Water source Bolje sestre is not fed with Moraca River's surface watercourse.
This is proven by the investigation results of "Energoprojekt" from Podgorica in
July 2006, and water quality of the source (chemical analyses, location and
source water drainage mechanism). Earlier hypothesis on possible direct
connection with Moraca River watercourse, based on balance method, are not
confirmed in the investigation results.
*  Groundwater courses feeding Bolje sestre water source come partly from the
narrow groundwater course Grbavci, and partly from the karst spring
paleorelief.
*  Water at Bolje sestre source is extremely high quality in terms of chemical
composition. This is the case with the water of groundwater course Grbavci,
which is used for drinking through drilled and dug wells.

* On the basis of water quality analysis at Boije sestre and Karuc, it may be
concluded that waters of these sources belong to the same watershed.
3.1.7. CLIMATE
The Lake region has Mediterranean climate (warm summers, moderately cold winters)
with very high evaporation. Skadar Lake lies in an area with extremely high
evaporation rate. The large amount of precipitation coupled with high summer
temperatures contribute to the chemical impact of weather and the development of
karst landscape. Annual precipitation varies from 1800 mm to 3250 mm, while
average monthly temperatures are in the interval from 4 to 280C. Due to changeable
precipitation, the lake depth (5-10 m) and surface are fluctuate considerably (35,000 -
60,000 ha). There are many sunny days during the year, approximately 2600 hours
per year, while monthly average ranges from 88 hours in winter to 369 hours in
summer. Annual average number of cloudy days is 84.3 days. Mean annual relative
humidity is 66%.
Northern and eastern winds blowing in the Skadar Lake watershed are strong, dry and
cold, and blow during autumn, winter and spring. Very similar are winds blowing from
the northwest. Southern winds increase air temperature and relative humidity and
bring rain. These winds more often blow in October, November and April. Winds
blowing from west, though rare in this region, may be extremely strong, and bring
thunder, hailstorm, heavy rains, and frequently cause damage.
These data show that Skadar Lake has Mediterranean to continental climate, while
Lake Shores at higher height above sea level have climate characteristic for
mountains.
3.1.8. ECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY
Skadar Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in Europe and has an extremely
wide floodplain in its northern part. Ramsar convention from 1996 included Skadar
Lake into list of internationally important swamps, as significant water birds' habitat.
Skadar Lake is situated at the meeting point of large zoogeographic areas: spatial
Palaearctic area of Mediterranean and Northern Africa, which is very important for
migratory part of fauna. The connection of these areas over Skadar Lake is best
illustrated through bird fauna, i.e. the presence of winter species from various parts of
the world.
Due to preserved ecosystem and inaccessibility of some parts, Skadar Lake is habitat
for 279 bird species, among which 73 are migratory nesting species, 18 species are
regular visitors in autumn and spring, 45 are regular winter visitors, 12 species
regularly spend summer but do not form nests, and 90 species are occasional visitors
to Skadar Lake. Thus, total number of 238, i.e. 90% of Skadar Lake bird species
belongs to migratory part of bird fauna, which connects Lake with the neighbouring
and distant countries and continents. The species feeding in this area include: Pygmy
Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus), Dalmatian Pelican, various species of ducks,
woodpeckers, skylarks, etc. The trademark of this lake is surly pelican.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
Among total number of species that have been registered in the Skadar Lake basin,
239 species have status of protected bird species in the National Park. Many of these
are rare and endangered. The number of birds spending winter on the lake has
sharply decreased in recent years, from around 250,000 in 1999 to around 80.000 in
2004. The number of Dalmatian pelican dropped as well from 25 to some 6 pairs only,
while ducks feeding in the area are almost gone.
Around 40 fish species live in the lake and the most interesting among them are
indigenous species of carps and bleaks. What fascinates is that even some saltwater
fish may be found here, such as: eel, salmon and many other species.
In the National Park, nature protection is provided by categories. In accordance with
provisions of the Law on nature protection, ornithological reserves Panceva oka and
Manastirska tapija are selected and protected within the category of special nature
reserves, while the proclamation of another two ornithological reserves - Crni zar and
islet Grmozur - is pending.
Area of Lake Waters and its northern wetland coast, together covering the area of
20.000 ha, are under international protection. The area encompasses the most
important bird habitats, such as winter habitations, feeding and nesting sites, including
the migratory route for many migratory birds (Podhumski Bay). Ramsar convention
from 1996 included Skadar Lake into list of wetlands of international importance, as
significant water birds' habitat. The mere act of registration made the natural values of
this National Park become internationally recognized and new protection mechanisms
to be introduced, along with the existing WISE USE mechanism, in line with
sustainable development.
The most important ratified conventions for Skadar Lake are: Convention on swamp
areas of international importance (1995.), Convention on biodiversity (2002.), and
Convention on international trade in endangered species - CITES (2002.).
n ~~i"           iiC' d *tt
Ecosystem of the lake is extremely complex, sub-Mediterranean type, with dominant
wetland biotypes, which cover mainly northern side, and thus represents important
habitat for bird survival. It is related to the general high production of organic mass in
this area, from plankton production, to invertebrates and fish, birds and mammals.
Enormous ecological diversity and complexity of mutual relations, especially of food
chain, is mostly evident in the zone of macrophyte vegetation.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
Life processes are most intensive there. Birds, as significant secondary biomass
consumers, play extremely important role in the circling of substances within the
ecosystem, or within the entire ecosystem metabolism. Role of birds is also
emphasized by the fact that these are very movable organisms, which transfer easily
and quickly, not just within the area, but also inside the whole region. Birds also
represent the most important biological connection with other ecosystems that are
frequently very distant.
Swamp birds belong to the mostly endangered group of birds in Europe, which is
evident in general decrease in the number of these birds. A decrease in the number of
the species spending winter at the Skadar Lake has been registered. The fact has
been proven during the ten-year-long (IWC) monitoring, continually conducted since
1990. The reasons of decrease in the population number most probably lies in the
general conditions of the ecosystem and in the combination of many causes. One of
the ecological factors - disturbance - is among the causes often neglected in public
and in action planning. Practice has proven its great importance and serious
consequences it can leave on bird population (apparent examples are the colonies
which have suffered greater changes: Manastirka tapija, Crni Zar and Panceva oka).
Although the hunting pressure, which has been the basic form of disturbance to date,
has reduced, other forms of disturbance are still present and increasing. Disturbance
is a consequence of all activities on the Lake, from wood exploitation, to random
construction of various facilities, movement of people, tourism activities, exploitation of
mineral resources, construction of new roads, etc.
The accompanying list of Cyclostomatous and Pisces of Skadar Lake shows that
ichthyofauna consists of 17 families, 38 genera and 45 species.
The fauna, similar to the one near Adriatic Sea, is a territory with significant number of
endemic species. Among these species are: Pachychilon pictum and Salmothymus
obtusirostris zetensis. Bojana River is the Skadar Lake's oufflow and provides a direct
connection with Adriatic Sea.
The presence of cold tributaries, primarily Moraca River, accounts for the temporary
and permanent presence of salmon species in Skadar Lake, such as: Salmo trutta
fario, Salmo gairdneri, Salmo dentex, and Salmo marmoratus.
Skadar Lake is an ideal cyprinid lake, due to its low altitude above sea level,
shallowness and warmth. In qualitative sense, it is rather poor, since there are only 16
genera and only the genus Leuciscus has more then one species - two. Contrary to a
low qualitative representation of cyprinids, there is a large quantitative representation
of bleak specimen - Alburnus alborella, and carp specimen - Cyprinus carpio, both of
which have high market value, as well as Rutilus rubilio, and Scardinius
erythrophthalmus scardafa.
On the territory of NP Skadar Lake there are no protected flora's species.
Malo blato has typical characteristics regarding biodiversity, geomorphology,
hydrogeology, thermal regime, etc. as the Skadar Lake. In this area, there are no
registered rare or endangered species. Therefore, itself, Malo blato has been
analyzed as a part of Skadar Lake.

Water source Boije sestre, located in Malo blato in the Skadar Lake basin, is inhabited
by colonies of Chelidonias hybrida. The monitoring conducted in winter months
showed that a number of flocks spending winter there is decreasing (Anas crecca -
Teal, Anas acuta - Pintail, Anas Plathyhynchos - Mallard, Anas Penelope L. - Wigeon,
Aythya ferina - Pochard, Podiceps nigricolis - Eared Grebe, Phalacrocorax carbo -
Comorant, Phalacrocorax pygmeus - Pygmy Comorant, Fulica atra - Coot, etc.). On
the basis of ornithological investigations performed to date, the water source itself and
its closest surroundings do not represent bird nesting sites and are in no other way
distinctive location.
Malo blato area, thus the Boije sestre source, is not known as an area inhabited with
specific plant or animal species, and is not included in the National Park Skadar Lake
special protected areas. In other words, the area of Boije sestre and Malo blato is
habitat of flora and fauna that can be found in other parts of the Lake, too. The
species found in area of Bolje Sestre are not rare or endangered and they are typical
for this kind of the spring.
Malo blato area, stretching from Zabljak Crnojevica, over Segrtnica and Bisevina
Rivers to the water source Bolje sestre, is still covered with microphyte vegetation of
white and yellow water lilies and reed (Nuphar luteum L., Nymphaea alba L. and
Phragmithes communis L.), and shore vegetation of white willow and white poplar
(Salix alba L., Populus alba L.). Malo blato itself is an open water area without
vegetation.

3.1.9. POPULATION
3.1.9.1. STATUS ASSESSMENT
Demographic movements at the Republic level, in the longer time period (analyses of
Population Census from 1971, 1981, 1991), show generally negative trends. Citizens
of Montenegro move out, total population growth rate decreases; birth rate decrease
is constant, and population ages. Migration from Northern to Central, and especially
Southern region, still lasts, and is accompanied with constant process of urbanization
(58% of the population lives in urban areas).
Skadar Lake NP area encompasses Central and Costal regions of the Republic, i.e.
the territory that administratively belongs to the municipalities of Bar, Cetinje and
Podgorica. Analysis of the demographic movements at the settlement level,
encompassing only settlements belonging to or neighbouring the Park area, indicates
absolute decrease in population number, within a longer time period. During the last
decade, the decrease has somewhat slowed down, due to the demographic
"exhaustion" of the area, rather than undertaken activities on consolidation and
improvement of the Lake area and surroundings.
Certain socio-economic and ethnic-tribal complexes neighbouring the Park, formed
during history, include: Krajina and Crmnica, in municipality of Bar; Rijecka nahija, in
municipality of Cetinje; and Ljesanska nahija, Zeta and Malesija, in municipality of
Podgorica.
3.1.9.2. POPULATION ACTIVITIES
Agriculture has been central foundation of rural areas for centuries, thus of Rijecka
nahija area, too. Skadar Lake shore region has poor agricultural potentials, consisting
of land in small valleys, formed at thin layer of soil. Deagrarianization took place, and
turned former agricultural area into an area with non-agricultural features. Household
production function is ceasing, which means that the role of households and
agriculture in the existence of villages becomes minor. Due to natural conditions, the
main economic activities are cattle breeding and fishery.
The location of potential water intake for regional water supply system of Montenegrin
coast is situated in the area of Rijecka nahija. Villages closest to the potential water
intake are: Dodosi, Zabljak, Prevlaka, Rijeka Crnojevica, Rvasi, Drusici. The area
lying in between of eastern hilly boundary of Malo blato and Moraca River is far more
densely populated, and comprised of Vukovci, Grbavci, Lekici and Farmaci Villages.
As in the entire National Park, negative demographic processes are also detected in
the villages of Rijecka nahija. These trends will continue for two basic reasons. First,
population base is weak, with small and much "aged" villages, and thus not a good
foundation for positive population policy. All the villages in this area are neighbouring
the Lake, which is continually less abundant, which causes their limited number of
working age population to leave the area.

As for the second reason, population age structure has significantly changed in the
last 20 years. Young population, which is emigrating, has decreased to one third.
Nowadays, one in three inhabitants of Rijecka nahija is over 60 years old, and age
threshold indicates that ageing process of the population has started well off. The
process attributes to the entire Republic.
TABLE 3-6 AVERAGE AGE BY VILLAGES
Village       Average age
Dodosi           65,8
Zabljak          44,2
As a consequence of these trends, number of households also decreases, and
furthermore, there is a decrease in average household size, which are already near
the limits of mere reproduction. In Dodosi, Karuc, Zabljak and Prevlaka villages these
limits have been crossed. This Park area is endangered, the population decreases
constantly, and its base continually weakens. Village population sizes are small and
very dispersed, which gives no hope of keeping not even the existing situation.
The wider surrounding area of the Bolje sestre source is not inhabited and two closest
notable villages are Dodosi and Zabljak Crnojevica. Though significant population
drain takes place in these villages, their existence is still not endangered.
Fishery is main source of existence in this area, especially in Prevlaka, Dodosi,
Zabljak and Karuc. In time, this has changed, and with the decrease in fish resources,
general sustainability of these villages would decrease. Nowadays, fishery remained
important economic activity, but it is no longer existentially important due to resource
scarcity and employment transfers to another industry.

3.1.10. TOURISM
3.1.10.1. STATUS DESCRIPTION
Commitment to ground long-term development of Montenegro on the economic
valorisation of its own comparative advantages, in line with principles of sustainable
development, gives the tourism industry priority in the future socioeconomic
development.
Due to complementarities of the Skadar Lake region with the attractions of
Montenegrin coast, Cetinje - the historical capital, Podgorica - the administrative
capital, and Bar - the leading port in the Adriatic Sea, this area undoubtedly has great
tourism potentials. The natural values, cultural heritage, gastronomy, old fishing
villages and sea vicinity are advantages of the Lake that are far from fully used, since
they have not been integrated into an easily recognizable tourist product. In addition,
potential opening of the Lake through the navigation system of Bojana River, and
shipping line Virpazar - Skadar, as well as Sozina Tunnel, create setting for the
considerable change in the Lake offer.
Presently, the most frequent type of tourism in the NP Skadar Lake is the excursion
one (Lake cruising), which primarily appeals to the tourists visiting Montenegrin coast.
Local entrepreneurs organize excursions, and in 2004, 7.000 people visited the Lake
that way, according to the National Park statistics.
Beside this type of tourism, other tourist attractions become increasingly important.
Horse riding in the open areas, sailing, bird watching, and hiking are just some of the
tourist activities supported by the local entrepreneurs in the last five years.
NP Skadar Lake Spatial plan foresees various locations for tourism development, i.e.
spreading of accommodation facilities and tourist activities across the entire NP area.
Two old fishing villages are situated in or gravitate to the potential water intake area:
Dodosi and Zabljak Crnojevica. To date, the plans envisaged this area for the
development of rural, lakeside and fishing tourism. These locations can be organized
as extremely attractive ethnographic villages, and due to great advantages in
development of excursion and weekend tourism, development plans had foreseen
organization of special elements with the same objective, such as: restaurants, shops
and private accommodation. The construction of basic accommodation facilities is not
recommended in this area, according to the spatial plan.
However, even though these villages have doubtless potential for quality tourism
development, no significant progress has been made in that direction in the previous
period. Excursion tourism, i.e. Lake cruising, as the most frequent way of visiting the
National Park, does not gravitate towards this area. The majority of excursion visits
are focussed on Godinje, Murici and Rijeka Crnojevica. There are almost no
restaurants and catering offer, nor other tourism attractions in these villages, with the
exception of Dodosi. So-called weekend tourists make up the majority of visitors to
this area. Namely, the population has begun to re-inhabit the area in recent years, and
nowadays many abandoned houses are being reconstructed as weekend
accommodation facilities. The most common activity of weekend tourists is sport
fishing, which together with the lakeside bathing attracts the most of other visitors to
the area. The area is irregularly visited during the hunting and fishing season.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
A large decrease in population number and its increasing age average in this area are
without doubt the reasons for the lack of interest of local citizens to organize business
activities that could enhance tourist product of this area.
3.1.11. NATIONAL PARK "SKADAR LAKE"
Location of the water source for the water supply system of Montenegrin coast, as
well as 20 km long pipeline, is situated in the Skadar Lake basin. Since Skadar Lake
is National Park i.e. the natural value of interest for the Republic of Montenegro, the
environmental impact of the project will be reviewed by its status, categories of nature
protection and legislation.
3.1.11.1. STATUS
Skadar Lake was declared National Park in 1983., by the adoption of Law on Skadar
Lake (The Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro, No. 33/83). Independent
interest association Skadar Lake, as legal entity, began its work in 1985., when the
Protection and Expert Services were established.
The Parliament of the Republic of Montenegro adopted the Law on National Parks in
1991. (The Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro, No. 41/91), and in January
1993., in accordance with this Law, established Public enterprise "National Parks of
Montenegro", which consists of four existing national parks with joint Protection
Service.
Covering the areas of the municipalities of Podgorica, Cetinje and Bar, totalling
40.000 Ha, Skadar Lake is the largest National Park in Montenegro, which in addition
to water surfaces encompasses narrow shoreline strip. The boundaries of the National
Park are shown in Drawing II of the appendix,
The area with the status of internationally protected object includes 20.00 Ha of Lake
water surface and its northern wetland coast. In line with the provisions of Ramsar
Convention, in 1995., Skadar Lake has entered the List of wetlands of international
importance, as a significant waterfowl birds' habitat. The very act of the registration of
the NP natural resources caused their international recognition and introduction of
new protection mechanisms, besides WISE USE, in accordance with sustainable
development.
3.1.11.2. NATURE PROTECTION
In the NP, nature protection is provided by categories of objects, in accordance with
the existing legislation.
3.1.1 1.2.1. CATEGORY OF SPECIAL RESERVES OF NATURE
According to the provisions of Law on nature protection, the following objects fall
under the category of Special natural reserves:
*  Panceva oka, as the ornithological reserve and nesting site of pelicans;
*  Manastirska tapija, as ornithological reserve.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
The Spatial plan of the NP foresees physical extension of both reserves, as well as
the revision of the existing status - in such way that it would remain under protection
but within the category of general reserves of nature.
3.1.11.2.2. CATEGORY OF GENERAL RESERVES OF NATURE
According to the regulations of Public enterprise "National Parks of Montenegro",
Grmozur Island falls under the Category of general reserves of nature, as the nesting
site of many bird species, and the habitation of numerous population of _  (Podaris
moralis) and some endemic plants as well (Cymbalaria microcalidy, etc.).
3.1. 1 1.2.3. CATEGORY OF RESERVES OF NATURE
The Spatial Plan of the NP Skadar Lake foresees the protection of following objects in
the category of reserves of nature:
*  Crni zar, as the ornithological reserve and the nesting site of pelicans;
*  Omerova gorica, as the nesting site of many bird species, especially of the
Grey Heron;
*  Karuc, as ichthyologic reserve;
*  Djuravacki skolj (Kaurica Island), as the bird habitat;
For the abovementioned objects, a procedure established by the Law on nature
protection must be followed in order to gain legal status of the protected objects of
nature i.e. natural values of the Park, as general or special reserves of nature, which
will depend on the additional investigation results.
3.1.11.2.4. CATEGORY OF MONUMENTS OF NATURE
Murici beach is protected under the category of monuments of nature.
The Spatial plan of the NP Skadar Lake foresees the following objects to be protected
under this category:
* Obodsko vrelo (crater area);
* Canyon riverbed of Cijevna River, through Cemovsko field (connected to the
Park area).
3.1.11.2.5. NATURE PROTECTION ON OTHER BASIS
The special Decision of the Republic Institute for nature protection, on the territory of
Montenegro, thus the NP Skadar Lake also, certain plant and animal species are put
under protection, as well as their components and communities, endangered due to
natural causes or human activity. 57 plant and 314 animal species are put under this
protection.

3.1.11.3. INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION
Skadar Lake, together with Bojana River, represent typical example of dual (bilateral)
"border" waters between Serbia, Montenegro and Albania. As the subject of
legislation, these waters are equally subject to the international and national laws, with
national law being subordinate to the international law, since none of the mentioned
states has exclusive and full sovereignty over the border waters. The Council of
Ministers of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro is responsible for the
implementation of international treaties and conventions ratified by the former Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, and for the ratification of new ones.
International regulations relating to the legal regime of the Skadar Lake and Bojana
River are the following:
The Agreement on water management issues between the Governments of the
Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Albania dated October 10, 2001. (Article
1, Item 3), refers to Skadar Lake, its outflows and tributaries, Bojana River and its
tributaries from the transboundary area.
The Agreement on water management issues between the Governments of
Montenegro and Albania (hereinafter: Agreement) from 2001, represents a basic
international enactment, used as a baseline of the physical and hydrological unity of
the Skadar Lake watershed, Bojana and Drim Rivers, on the basis of which the legal
status of these waters was defined so that they can be exploited, conserved and
protected. A joint commission have been formed (Article 4), as well as a sub-
commission in charge of the Skadar Lake and Bojana and Drim Rivers, on October
31, 2001.
Besides the Agreement, the Statute of the joint Montenegrin and Albanian
Commission, adopted on the same date, may also be considered relevant to this
issue.
Both stated documents are constituents of the Montenegrin legal system, and, as
such, can be directly applied.
The possibility of water capturing at the stated areas is set forth in the Article 1, Item
2, Line "g" of the Agreement. Therefore, there is a clear and unambiguous
international legal basis for exploitation of these water sources for the purpose of
water supply system of the coastal region.
Article 2, Section 3 of the Agreement states that construction of new and potential
adaptation of existing facilities, which might affect waterways in a way to either come
together or intersect in the transboundary area, will be subject of agreement.

*  Considering the maximum water quantity for intake (volume of 6.894 million m3
calculated per two mounts - July and August) and in the period when the
water level of Skadar Lake is the lowest, volume of the Lake will be reduced
for only 0,03% in that period. Estimated water level decrease is app. 5 cm,
while the natural annual water level fluctuation is app. 5 m. However, it is well
known that the Lake's water level is continually recovered due to constant
water inflow and precipitation. Thus, the capturing of the mentioned water
quantities would not have any impact on water level and water quality of the
Lake, and the basin in general.
* Around 65% of the aquifer belongs to Montenegro, while 35 % belongs to
Albania. The Lake discharges through Bojana River. The Lake's most
important tributaries are Moraca and Crnojevica Rivers, as well as numerous
sources and underground sources in the territory of Montenegro. The foreseen
withdrawal areas, in the Montenegrin inland, will not have negative impacts on
hydrological, chemical, physical and biological features of the Skadar Lake
basin or on the ecosystem of the basin. The most important fact is that the
exploiting water in this way and for these purposes will not impair basin's
capacities for similar or other purposes.
* As for the issue of exploitation of international waters for the purposes of
irrigation, countries comply with the principle that the quantity of water
captured from the transboundary watercourses equals the water quanty
belonging to that country.
*  Finally, exploitation of surface waters - including the transboundary ones - with
the aim of potable water provision has priority over any alternative water
exploitation, as confirmed by the latest activities on the codifying of this part of
international legislation within the International Law Association (ILA) and
Parisian Institute for International Law (IDI).
* At the present time, neither Skadar Lake nor Bojana/ Buna River is considered
navigable watercourses, since not used for the purposes of international
navigation. Until the beginning of the Second World War, or more precisely by
the Italian occupation of Albania, both the Lake and the River were used as
commercial navigable areas by the bordering countries Montenegro and
Albania (established by the Berlin Covenant from 1878). At that time, the
transboundary water was treated as navigable area, but only on bilateral basis.
After the Second World War, the international navigation at the Lake and rivers
was abolished by the Agreement on transboundary conflict prevention in 1953,
between the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and People's Republic
of Albania. Crossing border between FPRY and Albania was explicitly
forbidden for both civil and military ships. If the navigation regime at the Lake
should recover, which is undoubtedly in the interest of both countries, water
capturing at the selected sources in the Skadar Lake basin will not impair the
potential Lake navigation.
Other important (ratified) conventions for the Skadar Lake include:
* Convention on wetland areas of international importance (ratified in 1977);

* Convention on biological diversity (ratified in 2002);
* Convention on international trade in endangered species - CITES (ratified
2002).
3.1.11.4. NATIONAL LEGISLATION
The protection measures for natural and cultural resources of the National Park
"Skadar Lake" are stipulated by:
* The Law on National Parks (The Official Gazette of the Republic of
Montenegro, No. 41/91)
* The Spatial Plan of the special purpose area for the National Park Skadar
Lake (The Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro, No. 46/01)
* The Protection and development programme of the National Park "Skadar
Lake" 2005-2010, and
* The documents of the Public enterprise "National Parks of Montenegro".
On the basis of the cited status, and the state of nature protection categories, in
accordance with legislation, the following may be concluded:
* By declaring Skadar Lake a National Park, the protection, improvement and
exploitation of its natural resources became activities of special public interest.
* On the location of the future source for the RWSS of Montenegrin coast, Bolje
sestre, there are no natural resources under special protection.
* The Law on National Parks stipulates, inter alia, that in the areas under special
protection: Due to erosion, torrent and flood protection it is prohibited to
perform facility construction or other civil works at the waterways and land,
which could affect the quality, quantity, spatial and time schedule of waters, for
the purpose of water and power energy supply for the needs of the NP, and in
the entire NP area.
* As an exception to the above, the Law permits the construction of the facilities
considered to be in the interest of the Republic, with the prior consent of the
Government (Article 19).
3.1.12. CULTURAL HERITAGE
Cultural and historical heritages represent an important segment of the NP Skadar
Lake's resources. A great number of archaeological sites, fortresses, monasteries,
and examples of authentic local architecture are located on Lake's shores and
islands, and date from various periods in history. A rich archeological fund of the
Skadar Lake basin comprises of many sites, insufficiently or completely unexplored,
unprotected and without a scientific appraisal. The Skadar Lake region has not been
systematically explored yet.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLIE SESTRE
Monastery complexes from the Middle Ages represent the most important religious
buildings in the area. These are: Bogorodica krajinska, Starcevo, Beska and Moracnik
in the Krajina archipelago, and St. Nikola and Kom Crnojevica on Ondrijska Mountain.
During the reconstruction at the end of the last century, the values of these important
monuments have been diminished due to the disrespect of conservation principles.
The most exemplary fortresses in the NP are: Zabljak Crnojevica, Lesendro, Besac,
Grmozur and Tophala, built in the central spots and of extraordinary strategic
importance as a defence area during the wars between 14th and 1 gth century.
Nowadays, these strongholds are completely neglected and overgrown with
vegetation. The research activities at the fortresses, to date rare, if any, should be
priority, due to the importance and the current condition of these monuments, as well
as their professional and scientific appraisal.
The authentic local architecture, such as: old rural settlements, abandoned fishing
villages, mills, and bridges, represent another Lake's special resource. These
important ethnographic units lose their traditional appearance and beauty on daily
basis due to inappropriate reconstruction and construction of new facilities. So far,
little attention was given to the exploration of the specific architecture of these old
villages; thus, there are no comprehensive studies that would provide basis for
protection and conservation procedures.
In the area of Bolje sestre, and its wider surroundings in Malo blato, there are no
protected resources.
3.2. MONTENEGRIN COAST
The region of Montenegrin Coast covers the narrow strip between the shore and
mountain chain of Orjen, Lovcen, Sutorman and Rumija Mountains. The mountaintops
are at heights between 1200 and 1900m. The basic natural features of the coast
include: relatively long seacoast, narrow shoreline, extremely steep mountain barriers
in its immediate hinterland and Mediterranean climate.
In geomorphologic terms, Montenegrin coast can be divided into three regions: The
bay of Boka Kotorska - at its far northwest, Budvanska Riviera - as its central part,
and Bar and Ulcinj at its far south east. These regions slightly differ in cultural and
historical heritage, natural resources, biodiversity and town and industrial
development.
The coastal area is the terminal tectonic unit of the outer Dinaric Alps. The system
stretches in folds from southeast (Albania) and continues northwest. It is composed of
stratified massive limestone, limestone dolomites and partly of clean dolomites. The
area between Bay of Boka Kotorska and Budva is composed of cretaceous limestone;
while between Budva and Ulcinj it is made of Triassic limestone. Palaeogene flysch
zones, present mostly in Boka Kotorska, between Kotor and Budva, contribute to the
complex geological composition and structure.
Numerous sandy and pebble beaches (app.1 17), totalling 73 km, represent the main
feature of the of the 293 km long coast. The coast is rather indented and has many
inlets and bays, Boka Kotorska being the largest one.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
There are six coastal municipalities in this region: Herceg Novi, Tivat, Kotor, Budva,
Bar and Ulcinj. Each of these municipalities' territories covers a part of the coastline
as well as area naturally gravitating to the coastline, i.e. contact zone and functional
hinterland. According to the last Census, from 2003, the area is populated with around
170.000 permanent residents. This number significantly increases in summertime, i.e.
during the main tourist season. According to the data of the Ministry of Tourism,
accommodation capacities total around 270 000. Due to numerous attractive tourist
sites and main roads cutting across the area, the population density increases, and
complex urban networks are being formed. Specific and limited construction
possibilities and particular appeal of some areas caused small residential areas
merge with nearby towns, centres, thus forming agglomeration of urban areas
connected to the existing centres. As a result, all towns have more or less extended
their territories, representing conurbations with significantly greater number of
inhabitants (i.e. Herceg Novi - stretching from Igalo to Meljine, Kotora - from Muo to
Ljuta, and Tivat - from Lepetane to Mrcevac).
There are many separated lowland areas, aka. Fields, in the costal region (Sutorina,
Grbaljsko and Mrcevo Fields, Budvansko, Buljaricko and Barsko Fields and at the far
southeast Ulcinjsko and Vladimirsko Fields).
The most distinctive areas in the coastal region are wetlands with specific (halophyte
and semihalophyte) vegetation. These wetlands are mainly found in the area of Velika
Plaza beach in Ulcinj and Ada Bojana, nearby Bojana Rive, and partly in Buljarica,
Solila and Soliotsko Field. Saltpans or "Solila" are shallow coastal basins covered with
salt and other minerals, representing specific bird habitats. These are located in the
Bay of Tivat, near the Island of Flowers, and are candidate for the status of nature
reserve.
Velika Plaza, another environmentally sensitive area, is a 12 km long sandy beach
with a distinctive ecosystem.
Montenegrin coast is a region with the Mediterranean climate, i.e. long, hot and dry
summers, and moderately mild and rainy winters. During the winter, air depression
develops over the entire Adriatic Sea basin. A number of cyclones moving from west
to southeast and east and encompass southern European regions. These cyclones
cause heavy precipitation at coast in winter. The areas with Mediterranean
precipitation regime have autumn and winter precipitation, which culminate in the
period from October to December. The summers in these areas are dry. In this
Montenegrin region, around 10% of total annual precipitation falls during the summer,
the rainiest month is November and the driest one July. Average annual precipitation
is 1300-2500 mm. The precipitation decreases from the northwest to the southeast,
and increases with the altitude above the sea level, totalling in some areas over 3000
mm per year. Average annual air temperatures are around 15-16 °C. July is the
hottest (average 23-25 0C), and January the coldest month (7-90C).
Due to water-permeable carbon rocks, the network of aboveground watercourses is
rather poor, with the exception of Bojana River at the far southeast. Some parts of the
coast (Donji Grbalj, Krtole, and Lustica) have no aboveground watercourses
whatsoever.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
The examinations of flora in the coastal region imply significant interdependence and
mutual permeation of the endemic vegetation with numerous exotic plant species.
Grassy surfaces include areas with specific Mediterranean meadows and pastures,
mainly nearby Bojana River. Poor soil vegetation includes: macchia, various
secondary and degraded shrub forests, and deciduous shrubbery. The forests
encompass areas with the distinctive pinewoods. Special groups of forests are those
growing in sand, on Ada Island and in the hinterland of Velika Plaza. The coastal
region itself used to be the habitat of endemic Holm Oak forests, which have to date
been significantly reduced in number, degraded to macchia, or completely cut down.
Pubescent Oak and hornbeam prevail in the areas above 700 masl, and in higher
areas Beech and Pinewood. In the lowlands, near Bojana River there are traces of
hydrophilic Oak woods (Common and Pubescent).
Olive yards represent special and very significant form of land use, mainly in the
terraced terrain. Besides occasional olive trees, olive yards are found along the entire
coast. One of the greatest is the old olive yard in Valdanos inlet.
The protection of the plant species already under official protection is critical. The
protected species include: Galium baldacci (Hal.) Ehrend, Colchicum hungaricum
Janka, Daphne laureola L., Edraianthus wettsteini Hal. & Bald, Ephedra maior Host.,
Euphorbia dendroides L. Hermodactylus tuberosus (L.) Miller, llex aquifolium L.,
Ophrys fusca Lk., 0. aranifera Huds., 0. bertolonii Mor., 0. fuciflora (Cr.) Rehb., 0.
bombyliflora Link, 0. apifera Huds., Orchis simia Lam., Pancratium maritimum L.,
Phagnalon rupestre (L.) DC, Quercus robur L. subsp. scutariensis C ernj., Ramondia
serbica Pan c., Salvia brachyodon Vandas i Tulipa grisebachiana Pantoczek.
The fauna of the narrow coastal strip, distinguished as the area covered with macchia
and rocks, includes endemic Mediterranean species, especially the ones of insects
(Mediterranean  Papilio  machaon),  reptiles  (Lacerta  Oxycephala,  Lacerta
Melisellensis, glass snake, etc.) and a number of thermophilic pecies of song birds. As
for mammals, jackals are characteristic for the area.
The main industry in the Montenegrin coast is tourism. Moreover, tourism is also the
strategic development objective of Montenegro. However, presently, the overall
infrastructure cannot meet the needs of this region. Water shortages, especially in the
summer tourist season, are major setback for the development of sustainable tourism.
On the other hand, the share of agriculture is constantly reducing, with the exceptions
of the municipalities of Ulcinj and Bar.
Considering the long historical tradition, the coastal region of Montenegro has rich
cultural heritage, mainly concentrated within the strongholds of old towns (Kotor,
Risan, Budva, Stari Bar, Ulcinj). The area is also distinguished by a great number of
cultural and historical monuments, found across the entire coast, and primarily
including monasteries and sacred buildings.
The detailed review of the maps of protected areas and species, of which the
development had been supported by IRD, CHF and USAID (Appendix), showed that
the pipeline route does not meet the protected areas, except in the areas of Becici,
Buljarica, and Utjeha beaches. Environmental impacts on those areas have been
analyzed in section 5.2.

It should also be noticed that the most environmentally sensitive areas in the coastal
region, such as: area surrounding Bojana River, Salt Factory in Ulcinj and Solila near
Tivat, will not be impacted by the construction of RWSS because the pipeline route
does not go through those areas. The RWSS concept itself entails water distribution
up to the connection points with the local water supply systems, without entering in
the urban areas. The pipeline route to the connection point for the future tourist
complex at Velika Plaza beach for the most part follows the main road to Ulcinj and
has no significant environmental impact.

4. SOCIOLOGICAL PART OF THE STUDY
This Study gave due attention to its sociological component, i.e. positive and potential
negative project impacts on population. Accordingly, we have established contacts
with the non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Montenegro, and at the same time
held public meetings in Dodosi village. The meeting minutes were kept, and residents
received questionnaires that included all the most important issues related to the
RWSS construction.
Dodosi village had been chosen due to its geographic position, near the future water
intake.
4.1. ORGANIZATION OF SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Sociological part of the Study was carried out in five stages:
I Stage: Formation of expert team, led by Mrs. Mirjana Popovic, Sociology Professor,
the Faculty of Philosophy in Niksic.
II Stage: Defining Programme of activities, preparing questionnaires for residents that
might be affected by the project, as well as for NGO in Montenegro.
III Stage: Meeting with NGO in Podgorica on October 14th, 2005. NGO received
questionnaires, as well as the EIA study summary. The complete study was available
in the offices of the Public Enterprise for water supply, wastewater treatment and
drainage and solid waste disposal "Montenegrin Coast" in Budva. NGO had 10 days
to submit their opinions about the study.
IV Stage: On October 14th, 2005, meeting with local residents was held in Dodosi.
The EIA study was presented, and in the discussion that followed both the benefits of
the project and its potential impacts were reviewed. All issues were explained and all
questions answered. At the end of the meeting, questionnaires were delivered to local
residents, who had two weeks to fill it out and submit it.
V Stage: After data collecting from the meetings' minutes and questionnaires, the
elaboration on sociological aspect of the EIA study was prepared.
4.2. RESEARCH IN THE VILLAGES NEIGHBOURING THE FUTURE WATER INTAKE
The data for the sociological analysis were collected in Dodosi village, using
questionnaires concerning the issue of RWSS (water intake) construction in the
Skadar Lake area. The implementation of project would provide long-term solution to
the water supply problem the coastal region of Montenegro struggles with for
decades.
In Dodosi village, encompassing Zabljak village - the nearest to the Boije sestre water
source, the average age structure of interviewees is 35 to 41.

The gender structure is homogenous. 50% of interviewees live in an extended family,
i.e. households with 5, or more members (25%).
Main source of income for 25% of interviewees is fishing, thus for 67% of them Lake is
the most important natural resource. The same percentage (67%) of the interviewees
holds that those resources are untapped.
The positive opinion of the population on the project is deductible from the following
answers:
84% of interviewees hold that project implementation will improve sanitary and
epidemiological situation in the area, while 50% of them believe that they will be
protected from the potential negative impacts.
67% of interviewees believe that theirs and the position of their local community will
be in some segments improved.
67% of interviewees feel that implementation of the project will contribute tourism
development in the area.
58% of interviewees believe that their daily routine of the population will not change
due to project implementation.
The residents of this village have undoubtedly recognized the project on the
construction of RWSS as an opportunity to gain some benefits (roads, electricity, local
water supply system, new employment opportunities).

4.3. NGO OPINION
Questionnaires and Summary of the project on the construction of RWSS were sent to
all NGOs dealing with environmental protection issues, so they could provide their
opinions and remarks on the project. Interested NGOs had 10 days to so.
The initiator of the project received reply from one NGO - The Society of Young
Ecologist of Niksic, dealing with the protection and improvement of environment.
The activists from this NGO recommended paying special attention to dust control
during the construction, as well as means of transportation of the waste (covering
transport vehicles tarpaulin; cleaning access roads frequently, etc.).
The Society of Young Ecologist of Niksic stated that this project does not have
significant environmental impact on the National Park Skadar Lake.

4.4. CONCLUSIONS
From sociological point of view, Boije sestre water source is a good solution for the
construction of the water intake for RWSS. The residents of villages neighbouring the
source (Dodosi) have recognized numerous benefits they would gain from the
implementation of this project. It is recommended for the initiator of the project to
establish regular contact with them.
NGOs have expressed positive opinion on the project implementation, so their
cooperation in it is expected.
The project on the construction of RWSS for Montenegrin coast has been recovered
in 2005 and 2006, and PEW, engaged as implementation unit, intensified the
campaign as well as cooperation with relevant institutions and local waterworks, with
the aim of providing "no objection" and support for the project.
A round table was hold on the Water Fair (May 8 - 11, 2006) in Budva where the
RWSS Project was presented in detail (Design, Cost/benefit analysis, draft EIA Study,
etc). In the same time presentation at Montenegrin academy of Science, was
organized on the request of the Ministry for Environmental Protection and Urban
Planning.
The meeting with Skadar Lake NP expert advisory board was organized on November
7th, 2006 with the main subject presentation of the envitomental impacts of the RWSS
project on the area of Skadar Lake.
Public Enterprise National Parks, reviwed the RWSS project documentation (designs,
investigations results, draft of the EIA, etc.), made opinion that project implementation
will not have negative impact on Skadar lake basin and issued the official approval for
the project.
National television of Montenegro prepared and broadcasted TV special on RWS
Project, on November 30, 2006.
The Law procedure of incorporating Boije sestre spring as the water intake for the
RWSS into the Special Plan requires the public consultation. This process has already
commenced started from September 2006, and it is carried out by the Ministry and
consultant engaged for this assignment.
After the various presentations of the project based on its environmental and
economic aspects have been hold, it can be conclude that the project enjoys
significant public support in providing long-term solution for the water supply of the
coastal region of Montenegro, which will not endanger environmentally sensitive area
of Skadar Lake due to foreseen environmental protection measures.

capacity of the Boije sestre water source. These capacities are insignificant when
compared to the overall regime of Malo blato and Skadar Lake as a whole.
Considering the water regime of Malo blato, recharged with water from a great
number of sources and underwater springs, it may be concluded that there are no
negative impacts on the Lake.
Water demand is the highest in the summer periods, in July and August, around
13001/s. The estimated total consumption for that time period is 6894 x 106 m3. The
impact of water intake for the water supply system (1500 I/s) on the Skadar Lake
water balance can be observed through:
* The lowest volume of Skadar Lake
* The mean volume of Skadar Lake
* The maximum volume of Skadar Lake
* The total discharge of Skadar Lake
The lowest registered water level of Skadar Lake was 4.53 m.a.s.l., measured on
September 18, 1952. In general, low water level regime last very shortly, mostly
during September. The average lowest water level is 5.21 m.a.s.l., while the volume of
Skadar Lake in these conditions totals 1.92 x 109 m3. Water demand totalling 6894 x
106 m3 in August and September represents 0,03 % of the total Lake volume.
Considering the Lake's depth, the exploitation will reduce its water level up to
maximum 2 mm calculated based on m.a.s.l. During the year, the water level of the
Skadar Lake varies from 5 to 10 m.a.s.l. which means that the reduction of the water
level for the maximum 2 mm due to construction of the RWSS will not affect the
environment.
The mean Skadar Lake water level is 6.76 m.a.s.l. , with the total volume of 2.56 x
109 m3. The consumption of 1300 I/s in mentioned summer periods represent 0,026%
of the total lake volume.

ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
In relation to the mean long-term high water level, the volume of water exploited
during the two months represents 0,019% of the Lake volume, while the three months
exploitation at maximum capacity represents 0,02% of the total Lake volume.
In relation to the total amount of water discharged from the Lake through Bojana
River, at the mean flow of 323 m3/s, the total volume of discharged water per
hydrological year is 10.186 x 109 m3. In relation to this volume, the volume of
exploited water during the two months represents 0,006%, and 0,001%.
The presented analysis shows that water exploitation has insignificantly low
participation in the total balance of Skadar Lake. As for the water source itself and
Malo blato area, the percentages of captured water do not whatsoever affect the
water balance of these locations. Namely, the source has minimum measured
capacity of 2,34 m3/s, and in the period of maximum exploitation (July - August) it is
around 2,5 to 3 m3/s. That practically means that in the final phase (system capacity of
15001/s) in the summer periods, app. 50% of available water quantities will be
captured at the source, while the rest will discharge into Malo blato. In the rest of the
year, this percentage is significantly lower, and in the winter periods it is estimated to
be below 10% of the source capacity.
As for Malo blato, the minimum measured flow of its outflow Bisevina River is around
5,65 m3/s, and during the maximum source exploitation period it totals 6 to 8 m3/s. In
the winter periods this flow is much higher. Thus, during maximum source
exploitation, in July and August, 20 to 25 % of the water recharging Malo blato is
captured, while in the winter this percentage is less than 1%.
All above mentioned calculation regarding the water quantities have been made for
the hydrological minimum of the year, which is on September and October. However,
taking in consideration the fact that the maximal exploitation period of the RWSS will
be in July and August the level of environmental impact decreases significantly.
As for the thermal regime, the impact of water exploitation at the source Bolje sestre
on temperature increase of Malo blato may be considered insignificant. The
temperature of the water source (11-14°C) reaches the Lake temperature in its
immediate surrounding due to the inflow of Lake water. After the water intake
construction, where the water will be captured at the overflow solely, only the closest
source area will be affected by the project.
5.1.2. IMPACT ON NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES
Considering the insignificant impact on the Skadar Lake regime, but due to the fact
that Skadar Lake is an international lake, shared by Montenegro and Albania, all
issues will be settled in the direct communication of the two countries.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
5.1.3. IMPACT ON WATER QUALITY
Water will be used in the construction phase for the purpose of construction, site
cleaning, concrete production, and for the personal needs of the construction workers.
The water used during the construction is polluted with organic substances,
suspended and sediment solids. During the operation phase, the significant amount of
wastewater will be produced, i.e. sanitary water and wastewater produced due to
regular cleaning and maintenance of the pressure pipeline and reservoir.
Due to the distinctive pipeline route, the facilities foreseen at the pipeline are - air
valves and emergency outlets. In cases of accidents, emergency outlets discharge
water into the Lake. However, the potential accidents at the water intake plant will not
impair the water quality of the Lake, since the system transports higher quality water
than the Lake's water.
Though the supply of additional potable water to the towns at the Montenegrin coast
will have positive impact on the entire region, since the water shortages are
significant.
5.1.4. IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY
One of the main problems in the construction phase is the production of dust due to
heavy traffic, excavation works and concrete production. Exhaust gases from the
machines (trucks, diesel machines, compressors, elevators etc) will have impact on
the air quality. These gases contain C02, CO, NOx and sulphur oxides and other
organic fuel combustion pollutants.
Noise produced by construction machines cannot be prevented, but since there are
no settlements in the close surrounding area of Bisevina-Bolje Sestre water source,
this type of impact can be considered insignificant.
5.1.5. IMPACT ON SOIL QUALITY
The plant construction might have impact on the soil stability due to landslides and
erosion. Soil quality, however, will not be changed due to proper mitigation measures.
Waste production is significant in the operation phase, but the soil will not be polluted
since the waste will be disposed at the city landfill. The treated water is good quality
and contains no toxic substances, thus the potential waste sludge at the water intake
will not contain any toxic substances either. On the water intake will be installed UV
disinfection, which do not produse any waste materials during the operation. In
chemical terms, the sludge will be stable.
Estimated sludge quantity is small and will be disposed at Podgorica city landfill.
5.1.6. IMPACT ON POPULATION HEALTH
Since there are no settlements in the area surrounding WPF Bolje Sestre, there will
be no negative impacts on population health.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLJE SESTRE
Previously described impacts on water, air and soil during the construction and
operation phases will be properly mitigated so as to avoid any public inconvenience.
The present water shortage makes life difficult to the population, while its health is at
risk due to the consumption of unsafe water. Positive impact of WPF, due to excellent
quality of water that will be supplied with the future water supply system, is that it will
create preconditions for population health improvement, especially in some
municipalities at the Montenegrin coast having considerable difficulties with the water
quality at present (Kotor, Tivat, Ulcinj).
One of the significant positive impacts is new job opportunity in this area.
5.1.7. IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEM
The construction sites intersecting rivers, lakes and surrounding wetland areas might
affect natural waterways and thus the aquatic habitats, especially during the
construction phase. Changes in the catchments area might also be detrimental for the
natural waterways. Inconveniences related to the new plant or its construction in the
environmentally sensitive areas, i.e. wetlands or river channels, may temporarily or
permanently influence the fauna and flora. During the construction, the existing
vegetation will be cut, and after the pipeline installation this temporary occupied area
will be replenished with land and grass inseminated.
Air pollution and production of dust deposits might seriously impair plant communities
and their habitats, while noise might cause breeding birds to relocate. However, these
impacts are temporary.
Though Skadar Lake is a place famous for nesting of numerous bird species (more
than 270 species), and that some of them are endangered or rare, Boije sestre
location is not marked as a protected bird habitat or nesting site. Therefore, the
construction of the plant itself does not pose a threat to the wellbeing of the bird
population in the nesting season, when these populations are most sensitive to noise.
The greatest part of bird species is located in Hotski Gulf, under legal protection, in
the northern part of the Lake, will not be affected by the project, since the pipeline
passing through the Lake basin will not intersect this area.
The most significant impact on the ecosystem is caused by the landscape changing.
Lining the pipeline on the lake bottom will decrease this impact in the area of NP.
Lining the pipeline on the lake's bottom will cause the impact on ichthyofauna, but this
impact is only temporary. The ichthyofauna of the Skadar Lake is qualitatively very
poor, but from the quantitative aspect very rich, and exploitations of fish is very
intensive economic activity. However, the Skadar Lake is very productive environment
and if so intensive fishing doesn't have significant impact on the fish population, it can
be concluded that the lining of the pipeline on the lake's bottom will not cause any
significant impact also.
Another indirect impact is hunting of wild animals or disturbance of the construction
workers during the construction. This might affect some species and cause decrease
in the diversity of this area. Animals living the site will permanently leave this area.

FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
foreWbeeitactfi ? lt
During the operation phase, there will be no important impacts on animal and plant
life.
Summary of potential water source impacts:
*  Construction of infrastructure facilities would considerably affect the bird
population, if followed with loud noise during the construction works, while later
on during the exploitation process, the noise would be limited to the closest
facility surrounding. It should be noticed that the construction of submersible
pumps - almost completely silent when operating- is foreseen within the
borders of the water intake.
* Water exploitation undoubtedly causes certain decrease in water level, but
considering the location of the source this impact will exert only in the
hydrologic minimum, since during the rest of the year the source is submerged
with Lake water. As the immediate water source surrounding is cretaceous
with shrub vegetation, the decrease in water level will affect only the water
ecosystem, while the closest source surroundings will be permanently lost.
However, the water source is not known for significant fish resources or
vegetation that could be affected by the RWSS construction.
*  Installation of pipelines through the submerged areas covered with canes,
willow woods, coastal meadows and macrophyte vegetation, being nesting
and breeding sites of numerous species, will significantly affect the ecosystem.
However, this impact is temporary and exists only in the construction phase.
The project foresees the pipeline construction mostly along the existing roads
and rail lines, and partly at the bottom of the Lake and lakeshore wetland area,
in the area stertching from the source, east of Malo blato to the closest
connection with the road infrastructure. Since the pipeline wuill be partly
submerged and buried in the wetland area, the quick recovery of the
ecosystem is expected.
5.1.8. POTENTIAL NEGATIVE POOR MANAGEMENT IMPACT
After starting up the water treatment plant operation, there is a possibility of
personnel's unprofessional work, i.e. poor management. Due to the good raw water
quality (low concentration of suspended solids and low turbidity), wastewater
quantities can be considered negligible. The project foresees septic tank, maintained
by the local personnel. Wastewater drainage from the water intake will be conducted
over the access road to the plant, which does not pass through the populated areas,
and further along a short section of the local road to the highway, and then to the
wastewater treatment plant in Podgorica.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOL]E SESTRE
Special vehicles must transport the wastewater, in order to reduce the impact on the
population as much as possible.
5.1.9. IMPACT ON POPULATION, ITS DENSITY AND MIGRATIONS
Starting up the WPF will have a great deal of positive effects on the coastal region of
Montenegro. WPF will provide good water quality and improve living condition for the
coastal areas and the villages surrounding the WPF. During the plant operation, there
will be certain impacts on the surrounding area, but the strongest of all is the social
impact that will result in the full employment of the local population.
Possible inconveniences to the local population are:
*  Obstruction of local traffic
* Damages to the local properties
Since the area surrounding the source is uninhabited and the construction of an
access road is necessary, the obstruction of the local traffic will take place only in the
section of the local road that will be used for connecting the access road to the
highway. Area surrounding the local road - leading to Grbavci village - is scarcely
inhabited. The local road is currently used for transportation of the sand exploited from
the Moraca River shores. Thus, these negative impacts will be temporary and
negligible, considering the present use of the stated road section.
5.1.10. IMPACT ON TOURISM
The future water intake impact on the overall tourism development of Skadar Lake is
negligible. The fact that Skadar Lake does not possess a central tourist attraction on
which the tourism development quality of the entire National Park Skadar Lake would
depend on, will significantly alleviate the impact of the foreseen water intake. In other
words, within the National Park area there are sites that could inspire tourist visits and
provide the basis for the tourist product development. The area of Bolje sestre water
source - as well as many other sources of Malo blato - is accessible only by small
boats and does not represent an important part of the tourist offer of the NP Skadar
Lake. Other sites have developed more value added tourist programmes. The area of
Boije sestre is nowadays rarely visited, with the exception of the local population who
visits the source due to its water quality and former belief that the water of the source
has curative powers.
The WPF construction will have significant positive impacts on the tourism
development in the area due to the provision of new infrastructure - primarily the
access road and electrification. The construction of the access road will make the
area rich in water sources easily reached particularly from Podgorica - the most
densely populated region of Montenegro and the area of the utmost development
growth - thus creating tourism growth prospects.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
As for the construction phase, the installation of pipeline will exert significant impact,
especially since it will be installed along the transportation infrastructure for the most
part. For that reason, a special attention will be given to the pipeline construction
dynamics. In order to alleviate the impact on transportation as much as possible, it is
necessary to avoid the tourist season. On the other side, the installation of pipeline
along the shoreline and at the bottom of the Lake in the area of Malo blato must be
performed in the dry period overlapping with the tourist season.
5.1.11. IMPACT ON LAND USE AND MANAGEMENT
Using land for the purpose of RWSS construction will affect local fishing and hunting,
as well as recreational activities of the population and visitors. This impact will be
maximized during the pipeline installation in the area of NP. However, this impact is
temporary. The water intake construction on these activities is negligible.
Some construction works regarding the regional water supply system will have to be
carried out on the private land. It has been estimated that the total size of the private
land to be acquired will be 1, 5 ha, divided as follows:
*  -Water intake "Bolje sestre" at Skadar Lake/Podgorica Municipality - 1 ha,
*  -Access road to the water intake and reservoir "Bratica" in Ulcinj - 0, 5 ha,
All other compensations are related to the so-called temporary expropriations (former
licenses that were granted have been expired), or the right to install pipeline that will
cover app. 2 ha on the pipeline route from the water intake "Boije Sestre" to the
reservoir "Djurmani" and from the reservoir "Bratica" to Ada Bojana Island in Ulcinj,
where certain temporary expropriations through olivewoods is expected.
The exact extent of the works on the private land will be known upon completion of
the final designs. At this stage, no demolitions are foreseen.
5.1.12. IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE
In the construction phase, impacts on communal infrastructure may be considered a
nuisance to the local population: the obstruction of local traffic (possible road
blockages due to the great deal of vehicles needed for construction) and damages of
local properties (possible pollution of the existing roads or their destruction).
Operational phase includes the construction of new water supply system.
All towns in the coastal region of Montenegro have separate sewage systems. Since
the local systems are being reconstructed, additional quantities of potable and
wastewater will not have particular negative impacts on water distribution to the main
consumers. The issue of wastewater discharge into the sea without prior
physicochemical and biological treatment remains present..

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
The construction of transmission main and other facilities of the future water supply
system also include the following: in dry, only partly flooded terrain, the pipeline route
is buried in the soil, without any environmental impact; the pipeline section in the
constantly flooded terrain is buried in the existing ground at or below the level of the
ground; the pipeline sections along main roads dug in "shoulders" or special concrete
boxes in the road structure, thus without any impact on the traffic regime after the
pipeline construction.
The impact in the construction phase related to the traffic obstruction is unavoidable,
but reasonable and acceptable, too, considering the extent of the project scope and
benefits, and the implementation of the mitigation measures given in the section 6.2.8.
of this study.
All the facilities and pipeline of the future RWSS will be located outside the protected
areas, with the exception of those constructed in the Natural Park Skadar Lake area.
5.1.13. IMPACT ON NATURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
There is a number of evidence about natural, archaeological and historical
monuments in this region. The project foreseen pipeline route as well as the water
intake site itself will have no impact whatsoever on the protected facilities. In addition
the pipeline route in the NP area mainly runs along rail lines and highway. In case of
any archaeological monument discovery, the construction works will be suspended
and the Republic Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments informed on the
discovery, as stipulated by law. The construction works will be continued according to
the instructions of the Institute.
5.1.14. IMPACT ON LANDSCAPE FEATURES
Landscape features of the local area will certainly be altered due to water intake
facility construction. The main features of the area are its limestone origin and short
vegetation, and architecture design of the water intake and other facilities should fit in
with it.
5.1.15. OTHER IMPACTS
The source electrification and its environmental impact is another project segment
worth mentioning.
The electric energy will be supplied from the electromagnetic system a few kilometres
away from the water intake, located in the hinterland of NP, meaning from the area of
Golubovci village in the Zeta Valley. This activity entails construction of the power-
transmission line from the power distribution station of "Elektroprivreda Crne Gore" to
WPF. The route of the overhead power-transmission line will follow the road
infrastructure and winding up the access road to the WPF, where power sub-station
will be located. Thus, only the power sub-station will be located in the environmentally
sensitive area of NP, more precisely within the WPF itself.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BoLUE SESTRE
The construction of the power-transmission line will comply with the construction
standards determined by Power Supply Company of Montenegro. Harmful
substances, for example, asbestos, and the use of PBC in the new power transformer
must be eliminated.
The construction of the access road to the WPF at Bolje sestre water source, the
biggest facility aside from WPF itself, has negligible impact on the NP area. Moreover,
the access road does not stretch across the NP area, except in the entry section to
the WPF area where it joins the internal road. Its construction is planned along an old
unsprayed road that is no longer in use. So, even though the terrain is rocky, there is
no need for the use of explosives. The road foundation is good quality and requires
only tarmac base.
The project foresees septic tank at the WPF, which will be maintained by the local
personnel. Wastewater drainage from the water intake will be conducted over the
access road to the plant, which does not pass through the populated areas, and
further along a short section of the local road to the highway, and then to the
wastewater treatment plant in Podgorica. Special vehicles must transport the
wastewater, in order to reduce the impact on the population as much as possible.
The road route cuts across the unpopulated area, and the limestone ground has
almost no vegetation in the entire length of the road totalling app. 2 km.
Besides WPF at the source and the pipeline route, the third and the last segment of
the RWSS continental part is PS Reljici. The PS is located outside the central NP
area, at its edge, and its environmental impact may be considered insignificant. The
following features confirm this fact:
*  The facility location itself does not require any resettlement or demolitions;
*  The foundations of the facility are laid in the zaravni, thus no greater
excavations are required;
*  The facility is accessible by the existing rural road, thus there is no need for
the construction of special road;
*  Considering that there are no significant facilities in its vicinity, the construction
of the PS Reljici will have no negative impacts on the outlook of the area.
5.1.16. SUMMARY OF REVIEWED IMPACTS
An assessment of the environmental impacts that may result from the construction
and operation of the proposed RWSS has been made in reference to the baseline of
the existing environmental situation. The emphasis is given to the likely significant
environmental impacts, both adverse and beneficial. Temporary, short-term impacts
and permanent effects are considered both for the construction and operational
phases.
The summary presents the impact on the Boije Sestre source as the microlocation,
impact on the Malo Blato (as a part of the Skadar Lake), and the area of NP Skadar
Lake entirely.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BoUE SESTRE
5.2. PROJECT IMPACT ON THE COASTAL REGION OF MONTENEGRO
The project component relating to the coastal region of Montenegro entails the
construction of: pipeline, pumping stations and reservoirs.
It should be noticed that its most sensitive part - the construction of hydrotechnichal
tunnel Sozina (4,2 km) - is already implemented and requires small-scale
reconstruction that will be undertaken together by agreement with the company
"Monteput", which uses this tunnel as the emergency tunnel of the transportation
tunnel Sozina. Considering the state of the emergency tunnel, which is regularly
inspected by Monteput, the reconstruction will be undertaken without using dangerous
means, such as explosives, etc.
The constructed 38 km long pipeline between Budva and Herceg Novi, also the part of
the system, with all the complementary facilities is now being used as a part of local
water supply system by the public waterworks of the municipalities of Bar, Tivat and
Herceg Novi. The activities that will be performed on the stated facilities include
maintenance and reconstruction and will have no significant environmental impact.
It should also be noticed that the most environmentally sensitive areas in the coastal
region, such as: area surrounding Bojana River, Salt Factory in Ulcinj and Solila near
Tivat, are not included in the project. The RWSS concept itself entails water
distribution up to the connection points with the local water supply systems, without
entering urban areas. The pipeline route to the connection point for the future tourist
complex at Velika Plaza beach for the most part follows the main road to Ulcinj and
has no significant environmental impact.
The construction of the stated pumping stations and reservoirs, with the central
reservoir "Djurmani" - with the greatest capacity - already being constructed, will have
no environmental impacts, except during the construction phase. The project places
these plants outside urban areas at higher altitudes above the sea level in order to
provide financially and technically reasonable water distribution to the local
waterworks. Occasional inspection and operation of these facilities will not cause
increase in the noise level nor the dust production.
5.2.1. CONSTRUCTION PHASE
In this section it is necessary to indicate the volume of the foreseen works.
Activities on building of new and widening of the existing roads will cause significant
terrain changes and disturbance. This impact particularly reflects in the creation of
preconditions for the erosion process development by "opening" the terrain. In order to
protect both, environment from erosion and pipeline from lying bare, it is necessary to
provide the planting of the appropriate vegetation, with the professional assistance.
The provision of vegetation cover at the foreseen land surfaces should give good
results in eliminating the destructive effects of precipitation and their rapid drainage,
and thus preventing the soil erosion.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
Though installation of pipeline requires their burying, a certain amount of excess
material will remain, and it must be removed and disposed at the appropriate landfill. It
will not be allowed to accumulate solid waste on site too long. Solid waste, such as:
wood, paper, glass, plastic and rubbish, will be properly collected, separated, stored,
and disposed at the sanitary landfill. Residual soil (the remainings after works have
been completed and the pipeline properly buried) will be disposed at the landfill for
soil material.
A part of the pipeline that will be built mostly follows the main road. However, in the
section of the route, foreseen to avoid urban areas because of the activities such as:
channel excavation, pipe lying, burying, access roads constructions, etc., the
ecosystem will suffer significant changes. Reptiles and small mammals will temporary
lose their habitats. As the construction concept itself requires the burying of the water
pipelines, after the construction phase it is necessary to recover the previous
landscape in a greatest possible degree, which might entail planting of the appropriate
vegetation.
The construction of the system will have significant impact on transportation
infrastructure. The construction machinery will cause the increase in dust production
and noise level. Therefore, it is important to perform all the construction work in the
low tourist season, in order to increase the construction site safety, which is difficult to
maintain in the peak summer season when the population number largely increases.
Noise and dust will exert impact on the local population living near the pipeline route
area. Maximum construction dynamics is extremely important so as to reduce the time
of the negative impacts exertion.
The detailed review of the maps of protected areas and species, of which the
development had been supported by IRD, CHF and USAID (Appendix), showed that
the pipeline route does not meet the protected areas, except in the areas of Becici,
Buljarica, and Utjeha beaches. In all the other sections, the pipeline route follows the
main road. This is particularly important for the pipeline for the water supply of Velika
Plaza beach area in the municipality of Ulcinj. In this way, the sensitive area will not
be jeopardized, and construction activities will have to be implemented in accordance
with standard environmental procedures, defined by this Study.
In the Becici beach area, the installation of pipeline will depend on the conditions of
sandy beaches. The route foreseen for the pipeline installation follows the stone-
paved walk. Before pipe laying the stones will be removed, and after the burying of
the pipeline returned to the previous place.
This area is marked as a habitat of the protected species Euphorbia dendroides L. -
Tree Spurge. This is a deciduous shrub, large-crowned with short brushwood-like
branches, 3 to 5 m tall. The tree bark and branches are brown to red-brown, and
contain milky sap. In the local geographical and climate conditions, this species
presents an extremely interesting phenomenon. Namely, the plant grows leaves in the
beginning of the autumn, and flowers in the winter, while in the spring and summer it
is leafless.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
Before the commencement of construction works, it is necessary to consult experts on
whether the works will have impact on the plant's habitat. If the specimen is found, it is
necessary to properly and temporary relocate it until the works are completed. This
should be done with professional assistance of the Republic Institute for nature
protection.
The Buljarica beach as an undeveloped area represents the potential for the future
tourism development of Montenegrin Coast, therefore the pipeline installation must
comply with the future physical planning requirements.
Public enterprise "Morsko dobro" is in charge of the areas of Buljarica, Becici and
Utjeha beaches, so all the planned works must be in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the enterprise.
5.2.2. OPERATIONAL PHASE
The operational phase of the RWSS relates to both, the coastal and the continental
part of the system.
Since the subject refers to the water supply pipeline, the environmentally sensitive
segment of its operation is the cleaning phase. The pipeline design foresees
mechanical cleaning. Pipeline cleaner is a device covered with sponge and soft
rubber, and is carried through the pipeline by water, thus removing the potential
sludge at the inner side of the pipe wall, formed due to sedimentation of suspended
and other solids. The cleaning procedure contributes to the water quality in the system
as well as to the operational capacity of the system, the latter having advantage over
the former.
During the pipeline cleaning process, the water pumped into the system must not be
chlorinated so that when discharged it would not be too chlorinated. The sludge
quantities bore by this wastewater depend on the cleaning frequency.
The locations of the sludge outlets are designed so as to follow the configuration of
the terrain with the aim of their draining and cleaning. The system of sludge outlets
enables pipeline drainage due to accidents as well as regular maintenance of the
system. The sludge outlets are foreseen in each pipeline section, close to the
recipient.
Features of these wastewaters, since no chemicals will be used in the potable water
production or during the system cleaning, meet the standards for waters that can be
discharged into both natural recipient and sewage network. However, due to
quantities of this wastewater that will be produced, sludge outlets must be connected
to sewage network. As the pipeline project is over 15 years old and requires review in
certain segments on the Montenegrin coast, it is necessary to accommodate sludge
outlets' connections to the existing sewage network.
Poor management and inconsistent operation of the system could cause the overflow
of the water at the reservoir Djurmani. In that sense the design foresees the unique
control and management system, which will assure full protection. Extraction of water
from the other part of the system will not produce environmental implication because
of the very high quality of water and because the amount of water that could be
extracted is not risky.

Other impacts of the system in its operational phase include occasional impacts of
system maintenance, which will be negligible if conducted in accordance with the
construction recommendations given in this Study.
5.2.3. IMPACT ON LOCAL SEWAGE SYSTEMS
For the supply of additional water quantities from the RWSS, certain interventions
must be made on the local sewage systems. These systems would require significant
investment nonetheless. The priority measures are given in the Master Plan for the
sewage system solutions in the coastal region of Montenegro, prepared by consulting
company "DHV", Holland, 2003. Some funds for the implementation of a part of the
measures have already been provided, and the preparation of the implementation is
underway. The following text provides the priority measure to be implemented by the
RWSS completion, aimed at alleviation of the additional water quantities supply
impact on the Montenegrin coast.
*  Ulcinj - the construction of water supply system and collector at Velika Plaza
beach, as well as sewage system extension up to Velika Plaza; the
construction of the WWP, first phase for the city of Ulcinj;
*  Bar - the construction of submarine outlet in Sutomore, in the length of
L=1500m, DN 300mm in diameter; the sewage system expansion in order to
include settlements Toplica, Stari Bar, Susanj, Sutomore and Canj;
*  Budva - the reconstruction of the existing submarine outlets in Zavala, Sveti
Stefan, Petrovac, and division of sewage between storm and faecal;
*  Kotor - this city has developed sewage system with submarine outlet in the
open sea; the construction of WWP is foreseen in the near future;
*  Tivat - the connecting of the sewage system to the unique one of Kotor by the
RWSS completion;
*  Herceg Novi - the reconstruction and upgrading of the sewage system in
some parts of the municipality, where the system is worn out or missing, is
foreseen in the first phase.
5.3. SUMMARY OF REVIEWED IMPACTS
This section provides the elaboration of the solution with and without the water supply
system. The future RWSS will certainly have impact on the surrounding area, but
most of the impacts are related to the construction period, meaning they are only
temporary.
Table 5-2 provides the state of the environment without RWSS and with the future
RWSS, and the summary of reviewed impacts, as well as some of the protection,
reconstruction and monitoring measures.

5.4. THE PROJECT BENEFITS
Due to relative proximity of the project components, the benefits shall reflect in
employment opportunities for and procurement of goods by local suppliers. The local
economy will boost due to the procurement of necessary construction material, parts,
etc. by the local suppliers. Concrete production material, such as gravel, will be
supplied by the local suppliers (from the Moraca River valley). The rock fro the
covering of the facilities (pumping stations, pipeline) will be exploited from certain site
in the location area. New WPF will provide job opportunities in the construction phase.
Around 20 different professionals will be temporary engaged. Around 12 experts will
be permanently employed in the new WPF. To small communities, such as Zabljak
and Crnojevica River with 40 to 70 inhabitants, new employment opportunities will be
of significant importance, even though in relation to the average population age it is
difficult to estimate the number of working age inhabitants. The assumption that 1/3 of
the population is interested in new job opportunities would mean new employment for
around 20% of the population. New employment opportunities will slow down the
migration trends in this region (directed towards Podgorica and other big cities).
The benefits of the RWSS of Montenegrin coast are long-term and of great
importance for improving the stability of water supply services. Water quality
improvement and new job opportunities are also major benefits.
As for the Republic, the benefits reflect in the overall economic development - the
increase in production capacities and economic growth, related to the increase in the
population numbers in urban areas, which become more stable in terms of potable
water supply. These benefits are up-to-date, long-term and of great importance.
This project will have major positive impacts on the Montenegrin coast region,
especially in terms of tourism development.
Tourism is the main industry in Montenegro, due to enormous potential and capacity
for tourism development primarily in its coastal region.
Infrastructure development is the prerequisite for future tourism development of this
region. Water supply improvement is very important, and together with road
infrastructure, represents the priority in this respect.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOL]E SESTRE
Water shortages occur in many areas on the Montenegrin coast in summertime, when
great many tourists are visiting the region. Moreover, the water is often poor quality,
and does not meet stipulated potable water standards. In addition, many areas are not
connected to the water supply system, and a significant number of them are still
undeveloped in terms of basic water infrastructure.
All the stated benefits make this project critical for further development of the coastal
region of Montenegro. The RWSS construction will provide long-term solution to the
problem as well as allow the development of the region in accordance with the Master
Plan for Tourism from 2000. Apart from meeting water demands of the existing tourist
facilities, it will provide preconditions for development of new ones. This particularly
refers to the numerous undeveloped areas in the coastal region (Velika Plaza in
Ulcinj, Buljarica beach in Budva, Donji Grbalj in Kotor, etc.), which have enormous
tourism development capacities, impossible to develop without the water supply
system development.
The project will also have impact on wastewater issue. The additional 1000 and 1500
I/s of water will call for new investments in this sector as well. This particularly refers
to the locations (mainly in the municipalities of Budva and Ulcinj) where the
construction of significant tourist facilities is foreseen. Although the existing sewage
system has capacity to receive certain water quantities during winter, the need will
arise to expand these sewage networks and build wastewater treatment plants in the
entire coastal region.

6. ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN
6.1. IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION AND MONITORING MEASURES
In order to complete the construction of facilities successfully and conduct their
efficient operation, the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) should have the
following objectives:
*  Construction and operation monitoring;
*  Mitigation of negative environmental impacts;
*  Meeting  all the  environmental requirements, stipulated  by  the
Environmental Law of the Republic of Montenegro and international
organizations.
Potable water quality will be analyzed in relation to the international and local
standards, using up-to-date laboratory equipment that will be funded by the project.
The following text provides elaboration on measurements of the quality of water that
will be sampled before the water intake, in the WPF and at the very exit.
Besides the training programmes within the project scope, the personnel will undergo
trainings for work with the laboratory, water treatment monitoring, chlorination and
other equipment, as well as trainings for other types of work, organized either by
equipment suppliers or equipment maintenance contractors. In addition, the personnel
will receive training in health and safety regulations, and for work with emergency
equipment.
The costs of mitigation measures will be included in the contract price and submitted
by the contractor, who will implement necessary mitigation measures, in accordance
with the contract.
Malo blato is part of the NP Skadar Lake, but hinterland of the Boije sestre spring
isn't. In that manner the management unit of the NP is obliged to conduct the serial
ecological monitoring and in accident situation at the facility on the territory of NP.
Monitoring is in the frame of their regular activities defined by the NP regulations.
Public Enterprise of the NP, reviewed the RWSS project documentation (designs,
investigations results, draft of the EIA, etc.), made opinion that project implementation
will not have negative impact on Skadar lake basin and issued the official approval for
the project.

6.2. PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES
6.2.1. WATER REGIME
Impact on the environment caused by using the water from the spring could be
evident through the thermal water regime and amount of water which will be used for
the project. Those parameters are the biological conditions which determinate the
biological minimum. Considering the quantities of water captured for the needs of
RWSS and Boije sestre flow volume, the biological minimum will be provided. The
water intake itself, as defined by the Preliminary Design, will be constructed in such a
way that the source will be fenced at its very mouth so to prevent the inflow of the
Lake water, and the water will be captured at the source water overflow. This way the
environmental impact of the project is limited to the very narrow area surrounding the
source.
ere
6.2.2. WATER QUALITY
The wastewater produced on site, such as communal water, will be collected and
treated in the movable toilets with septic tanks. As for the wastewater generated from
the concrete production (usually containing suspended solids) during the construction
phase, an appropriate sedimentation tank or lagoon will be used for its collection and
treatment before the drainage. Wherever possible, the treated wastewater will be
reused for dust suppression. The construction workers will undergo basic training on
pollution control in order to reduce on site pollution as much as possible.
In the operational phase, wastewater will be generated during regular system
cleaning. Since the raw water quality is excellent and does not require treatment, this
water may be discharged into the natural recipient. However, taking into consideration
the quantities of this wastewater, it is necessary to connect these outlets to the local
sewage network. This would be preventing potential soil erosion.

6.2.2.1. MEASUREMENTS IN THE PLANT
The continuous control of the water treatment process performance measurement is
foreseen. The following measurements are foreseen in the plant:
* Continuous monitoring process, and
* Water quality monitoring.
The continuous laboratory measurements of both raw and treated water are foreseen.
The following parameters will be measured using on-site equipment: various water
levels and flows, pressure, turbidity, pH, temperature, conductivity, chemical dosage,
etc., while the results of these measurements will be automatically sent to the main
computer as well as to the Plant Manager.
Laboratory measurements will be carried out on daily, monthly and annual bases, with
different number of measured parameters, in accordance with regulations.
The treatment plant will have laboratories, both chemical and bacteriological, which
will enable personnel to carry out routine water quality and treatment process controls.
Plant laboratories will have equipment for performance of the following
measurements:
*  Physical and chemical analysis: turbidity, pH, conductivity, hardness as
CaC03, KMnO4 consumption, ammonia, sulphate as S04, chloride as Cl,
nitrate as N03, nitrite as N02,calcium as Ca, iron as Fe, magnesium as
Mg, manganese as Mn , oxygen as 02, total dissolved solids, suspended
solids;
* Microbiological analysis: coliforms, aerobic mesophile bacteria, algae
Monthly and annual analyses will be performed in the Institutes for Public Health, and
will include both physicochemical and microbiological analyses. In the summertime,
analyses will be carried out every day at different measuring points (before and after
the treatment), with the aim of confirming the appropriate parameters.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOL]E SESTRE
6.2.3. AIR QUALITY
The construction site will be very covered in dust, and thus it is very important to
regularly spray the roads with water so as to remove the dust. The machinery used in
the construction must be up-to-date and well maintained, in order to prevent oil
leakage, emission of gases and noise increment. In addition, environmentally sound
fuels will be used. Access roads to the construction site will be adequately maintained.
Dust production is inevitable during the implementation of entire construction, and
thus must be reduced as much as possible. In general, the mitigation measures costs
are low, if well coordinated with transportation and other activities related to the dust
removal.
*  Scheduling of dust generating activities should avoid the periods of strong
winds,
*  If excavated soil storage in sensitive areas is necessary, the storages
should be covered or protected in other way so as to reduce spreading of
the dust;
*  The selection of access roads can also reduce dust impact on population.
The access road routes should avoid passing through the inhabited areas
wherever possible.
Negative construction impacts will affect the construction workers, since theit health
and safety will be provided through safety measures and equipment. Prior to the plant
construction, the personnel will be well-trained in environmental and their own
protection.
Moreover, vehicles used for transport of materials will be covered and regularly
sprayed with water, to facilitate dust prevention and cleaning. Maintenance of the
vehicles will be regularly organized so as to prevent air pollution.
The noise impact cannot be mitigated during the construction. However, it is only a
short-term impact. Though there are no settlements in the plant area, the modern
treatment plant will provide good noise protection (i.e. compressors in containers with
sound isolation).
6.2.4. SOIL QUALITY
Besides the good planning and drainage, there are no valid mitigation measures for
the impact on soil quality during the construction. Proper supporting walls will be
installed to keep the soil and sand within a confined area. Proper drainage will be
performed so as to divert the storm water away from the excavation areas and thus
reduce the erosion risk and avoid storm water drainage. Unavoidable soil impacts will
be repaired as soon as the construction is completed.
All solid wastes generated on the on site will be collected and disposed at the city
landfill. It will not be allowed to accumulate solid waste on site too long. Solid waste
(with the exception of excavated soil and debris), such as: wood, paper, glass, plastic
and rubbish, will be properly collected, separated, stored, and disposed at the sanitary
landfill in Podgorica.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
Though pipeline installation entails burying, too, excess excavated soil is inevitable.
This soil quantity does not pose pollution threat if properly disposed in the same area
and covered with adequate vegetation. In case these measures cannot be
implemented, the excess excavation material is transported and disposed in the
adequate local landfill (sanitary or the construction material landfill).
Storages will be constructed so as to fit in the surrounding topography. All the
aboveground storage tanks and drums will be laid on low permeability ground, and will
be able to contain 110% of the storage volume. Spillage or drainage of fuels and oils
on the ground or into the drains will be forbidden. In case of accidents, the
contaminated land will be collected along with other waste and disposed at the local
landfill. During the treatment and disposal of residuals, the environmental
requirements and regulations will be met.
6.2.5. POPULATION HEALTH
Population health depends on water, air and soil quality. Previously elaborated
mitigation measures protect population health from any negative impact. The future
water supply system will create preconditions for population health improvement,
especially in some municipalities at the Montenegrin coast having considerable
difficulties with the water quality at the present moment. Sources in the municipalities
of Kotor and Tivat, in a part of the year, have high levels of water salinity, while source
Lisna Bori in the municipality of Ulcinj has high concentrations of NH3, Fe and Mn.
After the completion of RWSS, these sources will be disconnected from the water
supply network.
6.2.6. ECOSYSTEM
Mitigation measures for impact on flora and fauna will primarily be aimed at avoiding
all the areas of ecological interest through careful planning of temporary and long-
term activities.
Although the water intake is situated in the environmentally sensitive Skadar Lake
area, in the selection of water source due attention has been given to the sensitivity of
the ecosystem in which the water source is located. Accordingly, Bolje sestre source
has been selected with the presumption that it will the least environmental impact.
The construction process itself must introduce following environmental protection
measures, in order to diminish the project's environmental impact:
*  Conveyors must be positioned as close as possible. The construction should
be organized in the dry period of the year.
* Where conveyors cross-waterways, the ditch must be properly supported in
order to prevent erosion. Alternatively, tunnels may be dug as to avoid
waterways disruption.
* The number of access roads encircling or passing through environmentally
sensitive areas must be decreased to the least possible.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
*  Vegetation removal is allowed, provided that after the construction it is
replaced with new one specific for the area, so as to stabilize the soil and
avoid wildlife habitats destruction.
*   Hunting and disturbance of the wildlife must be avoided.
*  In the construction phase due attention must be given to avoiding breeding
seasons of fish, birds and animals.
The monitoring of ecosystem will be organised by National Park "Skadar Lake", in
charge of the area. The monitoring team should start its activities before the
construction and continue them up to 5 years after the plant's activation. Investigation
and monitoring should cover biological productivity of the local area, mammals, birds,
reptiles, fish, seasonal habitat requirements, predator-prey ratio, breeding sites. The
monitoring activities are regular duty of the NP Skadar Lake. In case of the project's
negative impacts, mitigation measures are defined and impleneted in cooperation with
this institution, while the manager of RWSS must provide financial and expert
assistance. The guiding principle is to replace destroyed vegetation with the new and
adequate one.
6.2.7. POPULATION, ITS DENSITY AND MIGRATIONS
The future water supply system will have no negative impacts on population or cause
its migrations. The construction phase will be organized in the period when there are
less local inhabitants, weekend and summer tourists.
6.2.8. TOURISM
The construction of the RWSS southern part pipeline is recommended in the low
tourist season because significant segment of the pipeline route runs along the main
road. As for the continental part, its construction is recommended in the period of low
water levels, since: (1) such conditions significantly facilitate the construction of this
part, and (2) the northern part of the route in the Skadar Lake are has insignificant
impact on main tourist roads.
6.2.9. LAND USE
During both the construction and operational phase the land price in the surrounding
area will undoubtedly depreciate due to limited land usage within the protection zones
that will be defined. This impact cannot be mitigated, but in the view of positive effects
the WPF will have for the coastal region of Montenegro, such land use is justified.
Construction of the access road to the water intake at Bolje sestre source will provide
access to the area completely neglected - due to its current inaccessibility - though
with significant potential for the development of eco-tourism. This process should be
monitored to prevent the expansion of unplanned and irregular development of this
area. Secretary for urban planning of the Municipality of Podgorica is obliged to
conduct mentioned monitoring as well as Skadar Lake NP management unit.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOLUE SESTRE
The land on which the construction of the future water intake is planned is state-
owned, as well as the most of the pipeline route stretching along the main road and
rail lines. However, land acquisition is an option primarily for the reason of pipeline
protection.
6.2.10. INFRASTRUCTURE
Efficient organization and management will prevent road blockages, while safety
measures implementation will prevent leakages from the transport vehicles, and thus
road damaging will be avoided.
Before and after the start up of the plant, the employees and managers will undergo
training, so as to prevent any inconveniences.
Traffic-related mitigation measures are similar to those of dust production, with careful
road selection and scheduling as the most appropriate negative environmental impact
mitigation measures.
*  Transportation through urban areas during rush hours should be avoided or
directed to the roads with lighter traffic.
*  In road selection, those passing through inhabited areas, particularly near
schools and hospitals, should be avoided.
* When construction activities must disrupt traffic, i.e. conveyor road
crossings, proper signs must be put up, as well as alternative route signs.
*  The construction activities that significantly affect traffic should be
scheduled for light traffic periods, i.e. during the night for the silent ones.
*  During the pipeline construction period, the ceratin impact will be exerted on
the area the pipeline is being placed. Wherever possible, pipes will be dug
in (at the bottom of the lake or in land). The exploited land will be returned
to previous condition by covering it with vegetation. Pipes above the ground
will be coloured green. Thus, this short-term impacts will be mitigated.
* Access roads will be constructed along the pipeline, so they remain
accessible in case of malfunctioning or for the purpose of reconstruction.
6.2.11. NATURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
Previously described measures for the protection of natural heritage - NP Skadar
Lake, will be applied in accordance with the international and national legislation. The
project design does not include any of the known and protected natural, cultural and
historical heritages, which has been confirmed by the approval of the National Park
management that after having examined all the project documentation gave no
objection to the implementation of the project.
If new archaeological sites are unexpectedly discovered during the project
implementation, it will be timely registered and the institution in charge will be
informed of it, in accordance with Law on protection of cultural monuments (The
Official Gazette of Montenegro, No. 27/94).

FROM WATER SOURCE BOUE SESTRE
6.2.12. LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS
After the construction period, the devastated vegetation will be rehabilitated as soon
as possible, in order to restore some of its previous appearance. The vegetation
replanting depends from the age of plant, and in the case of too old plants when the
replanting is not possible it is necessary to plant nurslings. Willow and oak trees'
planting will take place in the area of the WPF. Buffer area is planned to encircle the
gate. Next to the site borders, a green belt will be planted (trees, decoration bushes
and grass). Facilities, such as: reservoirs and pumping stations, must meet
architectonic requirements of the area distinguished by using rock as construction and
facade material.
6.2.13. PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
Contractor will take all the necessary protection measures for each type of the civil
works involved, especially in the inhabited areas and areas with heavy traffic of
persons and vehicles. All construction and rehabilitation works should be carried out
in accordance with health and safety regulations. Safety measures will be adopted so
as to protect the personnel involved in the construction Public access to the
construction sites will be restricted. Internationally accepted practice and existing
regulations will be obeyed due to health and safety.
6.2.14. MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING DURING OPERATION
The most common causes of system failure are: lack of spare parts, deficiency in
trained personnel, skilled technicians and craftsmen, as well as unreliable suppliers.
Most of these problems can be traced in inappropriate technical and management
training, inadequate operating budgets and unattractive salaries (both of which are
related to the low water tariffs that cannot produce revenues to cover the costs of
RWSS construction).
Since the water transported by the system is higher quality than the Lake water, the
impact in case of accident will be negligible.
Management staff will receive appropriate training before and after the start up of the
RWSS.
6.3. MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE COASTAL REGION OF MONTENEGRO
Mitigation measures necessary to introduce during the project implementation in the
coastal region of Montenegro should be:
*  Pipeline protection from the destructive effects of torrent courses at points the
latter intersect with the pipeline route, in such way to prevent potential damages
of the pipeline and provide for natural torrent courses, reflecting in the
configuration and karst features of this area.
*  Planting appropriate vegetation and constructing supporting walls so as to
eliminate the impacts of pipeline construction that might result in erosion along
the pipeline route.
*  Excess excavation material disposal at appropriate landfills or in the very
excavation area with adequate rehabilitation.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
ON REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRIN COAST
FROM WATER SOURCE BOL]E SESTRE
*  Environmental improvement through introduction of tree species into the existing
phytocenological community. Species selected for planting have to be some of
native vegetation in orders to non-disturbe the natural plant communities.
*  Eliminating negative visual effects of the construction by restoring the entire area
into the original state, and by ensuring that areas in the pipeline zone perform the
same functions they had before the pipeline construction.
*   Since in the area of northern branch of RWSS all the accompanying facilities (i.e.
pumping stations and reservoirs) have been built, mitigation measures will be
implemented in relation to the rehabilitation og existing facilities.
*  In the souther branch area, the construction of facilities, such as: pumping
stations and reservoirs, is foreseen outside the main roads at somewhat higher
and unpopulated (reservoir Cafe and Bratica and PS Belveder). The most
significant environmental impact the construction of these facilities shall make is
the construction of the access road due to machinery usage, thus the mitigation
measures relate to noise and dust The design of these facilities must try to
diminish the impact on landscape as much as possible.
6.4. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
The purpose of environmental monitoring is to understand the status of pollutants and
impacts during the construction and operation phase, and to provide implementation
of mitigation measures. Environmental Monitoring Plan for future WPF includes
feasible and cost effective measures in order to minimize or mitigate negative
impacts. This Program is aimed at integrating environmental concerns into the design
and implementation of proposed the Project. The monitoring plan supports:
*  Site-specific environmental monitoring,
*  Training of staff / contractors involved in project implementation,
*  Monitoring and evaluating of mitigation measures identified during site-specific
inspections
*  Public participation in environmental monitoring during and after the
construction, by furnishing competent authorities with information.
Prepared monitoring program describes how monitoring activities will be carried out.
Basic requirements for the monitoring plan include:
* Monitoring of environmental variables
*  Submitting reports to the relevant authorities and local community
*  Issues/concerns that must be subject of the environmental.monitoring program
*  Environmental standards and guidelines that need to be adopted or required
*  Analyses of the effect and possible mitigation measures for the surrounding
areas and landowners, as well as the site itself
*  Economic evaluation of the mitigation measures wherever possible.

6.5. THE COSTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT PLAN
The positive environmental impacts of the project are of major significance and
importance.
Financial costs concerning the implementation of the environmental monitoring and
mitigation measures refer to:
*  The funds for ecological protection has been calculated on 256, 410.00 C for
the whole system. The Boije Sestre spring requires the investments costs for
environmental protection in the amount of 24,000 E in the first year of
construction, and 36,000 E in the second year.
*  During the operation phase most of the investments are based on the
operation cost of the laboratory at the WPF, and occasionally performing the
comparative sample of the water in the independent laboratory which cost cca.
700.00 E.
*  Laboratory at the WPF Bolje sestre. The costs of laboratory equipment total
cca. 60 000 E. The laboratory will be situated in the personnel building, and will
serve for analyses of samples taken from certain parts of RWSS. Regular
control water analyses, conducted in accordance with national health
legislation, will be carried out by authorized laboratories engaged and funded
by the competent Ministry. These analyses are carried out separately from the
regular ones, conducted by the RWSS company, and with the aim of proper
RWSS operation control.
*  Implementation of the monitoring during the construction phase will be funded
by project investor, and carried out by an authorized laboratory.
*  Mitigation measures during the construction phase have to be included in the
contract for the construction and will be paid by the Investor. Implementation of
the mitigation measures during the operation phase will be responsibility of the
RWSS company and the funds for those measures will be included in the
operational costs.
* An expert team of the Public Enterprise Skadar Lake NP and an inspection
team of the Ministry in charge of environmental protection and physical
planning, within their regular activities implement environmental monitoring in
the area of NP Skadar Lake. In case any negative impact would be registered,
RWSS manager must eliminate the impact and mitigate consequences, in
accordance with the institutions of the stated teams. Environmental inspection
team will implement monitoring of both construction and operational phase in
the coastal region of Montenegro.
*  Public enterprise "Morsko dobro" is in charge of the areas of Buljarica, Becici
and Utjeha beaches, so all the foreseen activities must be comply with the
terms and conditions of that enterprise.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The construction of the RWSS of the Montenegrin Coast will provide lacking water
quantities for all the coastal municipalities, especially in the summer periods, i.e. in the
peak tourist season. The supplied water must meet national and European quality
standards.
The entire system is around 140 km long, and its construction will last around 3 years.
In environmental terms, water source Bolje sestre possesses all the necessary
prerequisites to be the source for long-term water supply system, high water quality
and avaliable water quantities which will not cause any negative environmental
impacts. Since the Skadar Lake basin is transboundary watershed, avoidance of the
negative impacts is particulary important.
The construction of pipeline and accompanying facilities in both Skadar Lake area, i.e.
continental part of the pipeline, and in the coastal region, will not have negative
environmental impact due to implementation of proper protection and implementation
measures, stipulated by project documentation and this study.
During the operational phase of the system, mitigation and monitoring measures
programme will be implemented for each part of the RWSS, particularly for the one in
the National Park area.
Environmental impacts must be controlled via monitoring programme implementation
in both construction and operational phase of the system.
