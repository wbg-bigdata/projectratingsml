MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The proposed project would be the second Bank Group financed urban
development project in India to support improvements in a number of cities in
one state. The project would demonstrate more efficient strategies for land,
infrastructure and shelter development in Gujarat and for the provision of
municipal services.   It would support new cost recovery and resource mobi-
lization measures and it would strengthen key state and local agencies in
the urban sector.
ii.     The total project cost would be Rs 156.6 crores  (US$ 130.5 million)
with a credit of US$ 62 million. The project would support investments in
five cities and three medium towns in Gujarat. In addition, it would support
priority investments in the rapidly expanding area east of Ahmedabad.
iii.    Area development schemes (14,500 residential and small business plots
in seven sites) would use more appropriate design standards and more
efficient layouts than in previous low cost shelter projects in Gujarat.
Differential land pricing would also be introduced to reflect varying service
levels and accessibility standards. The resulting lower unit prices for low
cost plots would enable full cost recovery within the limits of affor-
dability. Annual interest charges of 12% would be made compared to 4%
presently charged in similar projects. About 65% of area development plots
would be affordable to the poverty group (with incomes below the 40th percen-
tile). Public agencies would focus on land development with most house
construction privately undertaken.
iv.     Investments in Town Planning Schemes (land readjustment and provision
of infrastructure in 5 sites) would be based on more efficient designs for
infrastructure than in past such projects. Full cost recovery would be
introduced by changing the basis for calculating betterment fees to include
cost escalation, charging for off-site infrastructure, acquiring commercial
land for leasing by local government and increasing interest rates on unpaid
betterment fee balances from 6% to about 12%.
v.      Slum upgrading (245 hectares of slums in 5 cities) would replace
previous slum clearance programs. Tenure would be provided to beneficiaries
and the cost of land and development would be recovered with 12% interest.
vi.     Improvements in solid waste management in 5 cities would include
improved methods of collecting, transferring and disposing of solid waste,
and improvements in city-wide management systems. Investments in storm
drainage in Surat and Vadodara and in secondary sewerage in Ahmedabad would
provide priority linkages in these systems consistent with long-term develop-
ment plans and cost effective standards. Investments in the East Ahmedabad
trunk sewer and water supply and sewerage systems would address serious



-ii-
existing deficits, particularly the need to dispose properly of industrial
effluents. Recovery of costs for these investments through user charges will
be facilitated by the strong industrial base in the area. The Ahmedabad
Municipal Corporation is being extended to include this area.
vii.    The project includes a major effort in institutional strengthening,
including assistance to improve financial management of project agencies such
as the Gujarat Housing Board. A program to enhance municipal management and
resource mobilization is also being stressed which would contribute to
indirect cost recovery for municipal service and infrastructure components.
The capacity of the Gujarat Municipal Finance Board (GMFB) is being
strengthened to provide technical assistance and training to local govern-
ments. A program (to be monitored by GMFB) has been agreed to enhance
revenues in local governments including changes in taxation measures and
targets for improving collections.



I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01    This report outlines the proposed project which was appraised in
November 1984. In parallel with project preparation, a sector memorandum was
prepared to review sector issues and opportunities, to propose policy adjust-
ments and to outline an action program which the proposed project will
support: INDIA - Gujarat Urban Sector Memorandum, Report No. 4729-IN,
February 23, 1984.
B. India - National Urban Trends and Management
1.02    In recent years, India's urban population has expanded rapidly.
Between 1971 and 1981 it grew from 107 million (20.2% of total population) to
156 million (23.7%), an annual growth rate of about 3.9%. According to the
1981 Census, about 60% of the urban population lived in 216 cities of over
100,000 people. An additional 12% lived in towns with populations between
50,000 and 100,000. As economic development continues, and with stagnating
demand for rural labor, urban growth might be expected to accelerate further.
However, even if the present growth rate is maintained, half of India's
population growth during the next two decades will be in cities. The growth
of cities of all sizes is leading to serious deficiencies in urban services.
There are also acute problems of urban poverty, as approximately 40% of urban
households have monthly incomes below the absolute urban poverty threshold
(about Rs 700 in 1984).
1.03    The supply of urban land, infrastructure and shelter has expanded
slowly to meet the growing demand. This is due to a number of serious con-
straints in both public and private sector development which include a lack
of access to land, unaffordable planning and building regulations, inadequate
provision of trunk infrastructure by local governments, rent controls which
limit returns on investment and the lack of an adequate system for housing
finance. The provision of municipal infrastructure (roads, storm drainage,
water supply, sewerage, etc.) and of municipal services (solid waste manage-
ment, maintenance, etc.) is often limited. This is due to complex planning
and implementation arrangements which involve a large number of agencies and
expensive construction standards. More importantly, municipal budgets are
seriously constrained by low tariff revenues and limits on municipal taxa-
tion, particularly the property tax.l/
1/ Important constraints in the urban sector were identified in a recent
Country Economic Memorandum: Situation and Prospects of the Indian
Economy - A Medium Term Perspective. Report No. 4962-IN, April 16, 1984.
Volume II, Chapter 10.



-2-
1.04    The central government provides some policy guidance to the state
governments through the Ministry of Works and Housing (MOWH) and there have
been some centrally supported urban development programs under the Fifth and
Sixth Five Year Plans. The most important direct GOI involvement in the
urban sector has been through the Housing and Urban Development Corporation
(HUDCO), a semi-autonomous GOI corporation which comes under the policy
guidance of MOWH. HUDCO provides a large amount of financing to state and
local agencies (Rs 221 crores (US$184 million) sanctioned in 1982/83), about
80% of which is for urban housing and plot development.
1.05    The formulation and implementation of most urban development programs
remain the primary responsibility of state and local governments. It is at
the state level where laws governing urban planning and administration are
enacted and where most urban development budgets are controlled. Thus, while
urban policies and programs may be advocated from the central level, large
differences persist between states in the approach to urban development.
C. Urban Trends in Gujarat
1.06    Cujarat is one of the most industrialized states in India (secondary
sector accounted for 27% of output in 1980/81 compared to 22% for All-India).
Consequently, Gujarat has the fourth highest per capita income in India. It
is also the third most urbanized state (31% of its 34 million people in
cities compared to 24% for All-India).  The urban population is increasing at
about 3.5% per year; about 45% of total population growth is in cities.
Almost 60% of the state's urban population is in a corridor region stretching
south from Ahmedabad towards Bombay which contains the three largest cities,
Ahmedabad (population 2,212,000), Vadodara (Baroda) (744,000) and Surat
(913,000). However, there is also a relatively balanced network of seven
medium cities in the eastern Saurastra region with populations between
100,000 and 500,000.  It is likely that cities of all sizes will continue to
grow, with the state's urban population roughly doubling from 10.6 million in
1981 to about 21 million in 2001 and over 50% of this growth taking place in
the corridor region.
1.07    Land and Housing Development.  The Urban Sector Memorandum prepared
for Gujarat summarizes present urban development strategies and institutional
arrangements and outlines a proposed strategy for managing urban growth.
Public agencies (Gujarat Housing Board, Gujarat Slum Clearance Board,
municipal corporations, development authorities) acquire and develop land and
produce about 6,000 housing units per year, which is only about 10% of the
units required for the 60,000 new households added each year to the urban
population.  Most of these are completed units which require heavy subsidies
(e.g. land and overheads not fully costed and interest rates of only 4%-6%).
In real terms, somewhat less than 50% of costs is typically recovered. Since
the subsidy elements come from various sources, it is difficult to fully
quantify them for the state public housing program. They are, however,
instrumental in the large deficits run by agencies such as the Gujarat Hous-
ing Board (see Annex 7). The cooperative and private formal sectors produce
about three times the amount of housing produced by public agencies, but most
needs (about 60%) are met by informal development and the growth of slum
areas (7.7% annual growth of Ahmedabad slum population compared to 3.7% of



-3-
total population). The lack of access to developable land is the most
serious constraint to development by both the public and private sectors.
1.08    A fundamental shift is required in the strategy for land and shelter
development with public sector agencies concentrating on the provision of
developed land, especially for low income groups and small businesses. Land
development schemes could be designed much more efficiently with up to 50%
more saleable land and differential pricing which could reduce plot prices
for low income households by up to 50% (and eliminate the need for subsidies)
without reductions in environmental quality. Most house construction would
be undertaken by individuals and the private sector. Where land is avail-
able, large amounts of housing have been financed by the Gujarat Cooperative
Housing Finance Society (GHFCS - about 6,000 units per year) and the Housing
Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) which has recently begun operations in
Gujarat, and directly from private savings.
1.09    Increased provision of land, infrastructure and shelter would require
the relaxation of constraints which inhibit private investment such as rent
control. The impact of rent control on the housing market is less in Gujarat
than in metropolitan cities such as Bombay. Enforcement occurs only when
tenants take the initiative to file with rent control authorities. In
Ahmedabad, of 500,000 rental units only 800 cases are pending with rent
control authorities. In most cases actual rents rise higher than controlled
rents would. Furthermore, the effects of rent control on the property tax
have been somewhat mitigated by partially delinking property valuation from
controlled rents (see para 1.13). Nevertheless, rent control remains a
constraint. Its effects need to be better understood, and means of relaxing
its most negative aspects and to phase it out should be considered.
1.10    Town Planning (TP) Schemes have been used in the past in Gujarat to
develop land without acquiring it from private landowners, mainly for private
sector housing (59 schemes during the last 10 years involving over 10,000
hectares in 20 cities). Urbanizing areas are declared 'Town Planning
Schemes' whereby local governments may acquire land required for community
purposes (e.g. roads and open space) and readjust private plots to fit the
new layout. Basic infrastructure is provided, and landowners are charged a
betterment fee which is reduced by a reimbursement for land taken by govern-
ment. The schemes have typically been subsidized by local government from
50% to 90% of cost depending on the level of infrastructure provided. This
is due to a number of deficiencies. First, cost recovery is inadequate
because the formula used to calculate betterment fees does not allow for cost
escalation during scheme processing and implementation. The betterment tax
can be up to one-half of the increment in value but no more than project
cost. However, both the increment in value and the cost estimate are based
on price levels at the beginning of scheme processing. In addition, no
allowance is made for off-site infrastructure, a below market interest rate
is used and only limited amounts of land are recovered for lease by local
authorities. A further subsidy element involving double counting in land
reimbursement was eliminated during project preparation. Second, many
improvements would be possible in the design of road networks and infrastruc-
ture, especially to enhance the value of commercial areas which could be
acquired and leased to recover some costs. Finally, there are long delays in
processing and implementing TP schemes. A three-stage process, involving a



-4-
Draft Scheme, a Preliminary Scheme and a Final Scheme, often takes 5 to 10
years. Means of reducing this period without limiting rights of public
appeal need to be considered. In spite of these problems, TP schemes do play
an important role in land development by developing large amounts of
privately owned land through public/private sector collaboration, without
requiring costly and time consuming land acquisition. With some modifica-
tions they could be much more effective.
1.11    Municipal Services.  The most immediate problem facing municipal
governments is the need to extend services of all types into slums. The
highly subsidized clearance and redevelopment programs being undertaken by
the Gujarat Slum Clearance Board (GSCB) cannot possibly meet the scale of the
problem (about 6000 units constructed since 1975 compared to growth of slums
in Ahmedabad alone of 4000 households per year). Most local governments have
begun to recognize that the improvement of existing slums and normalization
of tenure is the only feasible approach. Limited improvements have been
undertaken but with no tenure granted and no cost recovery. Local govern-
ments lack a long-term program for confronting the problem at the required
scale. Improved management of solid waste (administration in city govern-
ments, work team organization, collection methods, transfer points, disposal,
etc.) is also needed. There are serious storm drainage problems, especially
in Surat where many natural drainage channels have been blocked by haphazard
development and improperly disposed solid waste. The problems of municipal
services in all cities are closely linked to financial constraints at the
local level.
1.12    Water Supply and Sewerage.  The Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage
Project (Credit 1280-IN of November 1982) is financing augmentations to water
supply in five cities, and sewerage systems and treatment facilities in
Ahmedabad and four other cities. The project also includes rural water
supply and low-cost sanitation components. With the exception of the
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), all works are being implemented by
the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB). The project includes
improvements in organization, financial management, operations and main-
tenance in the sector. An important feature is to improve cost recovery,
and some progress is being made. Revenues on water supply and sewerage
accounts were to have doubled between 1981/82 and 1983/84. While tariffs
have been doubled in all towns, actual collections are lagging behind the
target. The AMC has increased collections by 65% and will approach the
agreed target as outstanding litigations on property valuations are resolved
in early 1986. Project towns have agreed to cover the cost of operation and
maintenance from water and sewerage revenues by 1988 and depreciation by
1993.
1.13    Urban Finance.  Local governments are supported largely by octroi
revenues which account for two-thirds of tax collections and over half of
total recurrent revenues. Since octroi is not a long-term solution to the
revenue needs of local government, the best prospect for improved revenues
lies in more effective use of the property tax, which presently accounts for
only 15% to 20% of recurrent revenues. Part of the problem lies in inade-
quate valuation and collection performance which could be improved in the
short term. However, the valuation system, which is based on annual rental
value and is constrained by rent control, is a more fundamental problem.



-5-
During project preparation the State Government has amended the Municipal
Corporations Act so that 'standard' (controlled) rent will not be used for
property valuation where actual rent is higher. This is an important first
step, but further action is needed to either delink property taxation from
the constrained valuation base or to phase out rent control. The Gujarat
Municipal Finance Board (GMFB) has a large mandate for assisting with local
government finance, but it has played a limited role to date. It could play
a more effective role in analyzing the options for municipal finance and
providing technical assistance and training to local governments.
1.14    Financial management improvements would also be required in public
development agencies such as the Gujarat Housing Board (GHB). Conversion
from a cash to an accrual basis accounting system and improved project cost
accounting would help to improve project pricing and reduce deficits.
D. Bank Group Role and Strategy
1.15    The Bank Group's lending for urban development in India during the
last decade focused first on India's largest cities where projects in Cal-
cutta, Madras and Bombay have financed packages of urban services (sites and
services, slum upgrading, water supply, sanitation, and transport). This
focus began to widen to medium cities in 1981 with the approval of a project
for Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and in 1983 with a state-wide project for Madhya
Pradesh which is providing area development, slum upgrading, improved
municipal services and institutional improvements in ten cities. The Madhya
Pradesh project involves HUDCO as a central-level financial and policy inter-
mediary. Projects in water supply and sanitation have followed a state-wide
pattern (in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil
Nadu) as part of a broad program of infrastructure and institutional develop-
ment, with the exception of two projects in Bombay.
1.16    Urban and water supply projects have sought not only to improve
directly the level of urban services and shelter in India but also to address
some of the underlying problems in the sector. The principal objective has
been to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resource utilization and
to improve resource mobilization. Such improvements have included:
(i) fundamental design changes in land development by public agencies (e.g.,
plot costs per household reduced by 75%); (ii) the gradual shift of housing
construction and finance from the public to the private sector; (iii) a shift
of emphasis from slum clearance to upgrading with the provision of tenure to
encourage private investment; (iv) improved management of municipal solid
waste and maintenance operations; and (v) lower cost technology in sanita-
tion. More effective resource mobilization has included: (i) improved cost
recovery (e.g., interest rates increased from 4-5% to 12% in land development
and shelter projects and substantial bus fare and water tariff increases;
(ii) the introduction of direct cost recovery in slum upgrading projects; and
(iii) programs to enhance general municipal revenues (e.g., through improved
property tax valuation and collections). Critical to achieving these objec-
tives has been the strengthening of institutions on the national, state and
local levels.
1.17    PCRs have indicated that urban and water supply projects have met
most of their objectives in terms of physical implementation and resource



-6-
utilization. Achievements in cost recovery and resource mobilization have
been less satisfactory. This problem is being addressed in two ways. First,
reviews of financial management issues in water supply and sanitation and in
municipal services are being undertaken so that the specific actions (e.g.
tax and tariff measures, collection targets, cost reduction measures)
required to achieve objectives can be better identified. Second, detailed
action plans of measures to be included in projects for meeting financial
management targets are being agreed to and used for monitoring progress
during supervision.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.01    The most immediate objective of the project would be to reduce the
serious deficits in urban shelter, infrastructure and services. More impor-
tantly, fundamental improvements would be sought in the management and
financing of urban growth. This would include improvements in resource
utilization (e.g., significant reductions in the cost of publicly provided
land, infrastructure and shelter and more efficient land use in TP schemes)
and improvements in resource mobilization (e.g., increased interest rates in
area development from 4%-5% to 12%, introduction of full cost recovery in TP
schemes and efforts to improve local taxation). To support these objectives,
the project 4ould strive to strengthen administration, planning and financial
management in local governments and state-level agencies in the urban sector.
B. Rationale for Bank Assistance
2.02    Many of the objectives described for this project are similar to
those in Bank-assisted urban projects in other states. Others, especially
the emphasis in improving land development through Town Planning schemes,
would be new in this project. With a high degree of state autonomy in set-
ting urban policies, new development strategies undertaken in one state are
not necessarily followed in others. To achieve a significant impact at the
national level, it would be necessary to undertake a number of projects
directly in the more urbanized states. Many of the types of objectives which
would be supported have recently been advocated in a series of studies spon-
sored by the Planning Commission for the preparation of the Seventh Plan.
However, there is limited financial support for such new directions available
from the central level, and the states lack the experience and initiative to
undertake reforms on their own. Thus, given the very limited involvement by
other multilateral and by bilateral agencies in the urban sector, Bank assis-
tance continues to play an important catalytic role in achieving policy
reform in the urban sector in India.
Project Location
2.03    Project-supported investments would be focused in the larger cities
of Gujarat where urban problems and the need for new development strategies
are greatest: Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Jamnagar. Over the
longer-term, the new strategies used and the institutions developed in these



-7-
cities should contribute to development of other cities in the state. Three
medium sized municipalities have also been selected for small components,
Jetpur, Palanpur and Ankleshwar, in order to strengthen the capacity of
state-level agencies to assist the development of medium cities. These
cities represent different regions and have had higher than average popula-
tion growth (average of 4.1% per year during 1971-81 compared to 3.5% for all
cities of Gujarat). One additional area of concern would receive particular
attention, the area to the east of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation which
is urbanizing very rapidly with a low income population (7.8% annual popula-
tion growth compared to 3.7% in entire Ahmedabad Urban Agglomeration).
Industrial growth has been rapid (8.5% increase in industrial units per year)
and service deficits are acute, particularly the lack of proper drainage for
industrial effluents. The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) has
prepared an investment and urban management strategy for this area and has
also prepared a first phase investment program to be supported under the
proposed project.

C. Project Description
2.04    The project would be implemented from January 1, 1986 to December 31,
1990 and would include the components described in Table II.2. In addition
to the physical investments listed below, there are a number of interrelated
project activities to be undertaken by participating agencies to accelerate
project implementation and to improve the operating efficiency and financial
viability of sector agencies. Although these actions are discussed in

various places of the SAR, because of their importance they have been grouped
into an Operational Action Plan (see Annex 1). The items in this Plan were
discussed and agreed with COG at appraisal. Assurance was given at nego-
tiations that the Urban Strategy and Project Management Cell (USPMC) would
submit quarterly reports to monitor progress on project implementation and on
actions contained in the Operational Action Plan to be adhered to by GOG and
the state and local agencies under the project; the Operational Action Plan
would be reviewed and updated annually by GOG and it would be satisfactory to
IDA.
2.05    The project includes initiatives to address some of the state's
fundamental policy issues. There would be a major effort to strengthen
municipal finances (see paras 3.09-3.12). The issue of rent control (see
para 1.09) is also being addressed. In the context of the Bombay Urban
Development Project, GOI has provided its statement of intent in the Approach
Paper to the Seventh Five Year Plan as an indication of its commitment to
move ahead on this issue. The proposed amendment to the Delhi Rent Control
Act, which could guide other states seeking to pass similar legislation, and
the Government of Maharashtra's own attempts to seek rent control reform are
welcome signs of movement in this direction. COG and GOI have been informed
that similar initiatives would be expected to be actively pursued in the
context of this project. The effects of rent control are also being assessed
under the project in the Ahmedabad Housing Strategy Study (see para 2.38).
2.06    (a)  Area Development.  (Base cost 1/:  US$11.61 million; Rs 13.93
crores). About 100 hectares would be developed in seven sites to provide
about 14,000 serviced residential plots and about 3 hectares for commercial
and small business plots. These include one each in Ahmedabad, Vadodara,
Ankleshwar, Palanpur and Ghodasar (E. Ahmedabad) and two in Surat. All sites
are located close to employment locations and adjacent to developed residen-
tial areas. Land for all the sites has already.been acquired except for 4 of
the 44 hectares in Vadodara and the sites in Ahmedabad and Ghodasar. The
Ahmedabad site is being acquired by AMC in a revised TP scheme. The Ghodasar
site would be acquired as part of a new TP scheme.
2.07    Emphasis is being placed on design characteristics which would make
about 65% of the plots affordable to low income (EWS and LIG) households
earning Rs 650 per month or less. Layout designs are appropriate for the
needs of the various income groups to be accommodated. An average of about
65% of each site would be marketable compared to 40% typical in existing
projects in Gujarat. An average density of about 700 persons per hectare
would be achieved in the new communities. Plot sizes would vary from about 25
m2 for EWS households to 300 m2 for HIG households. Table II.3 and Figure
II.1 give the distribution of area development schemes by city and income
group. Since some of the proposed standards are not consistent with existing
planning and building regulations, assurance was given at negotiations that
the proposed area development sub-projects would receive necessary COG and
local planning, engineering and building approval as appraised.
1/ Base cost here includes taxes, physical contingencies, design, supervi-
sion and management, but not price contingencies.

below poverty threshold
Recent household income information is not available. It i5 estimated
conservatively that the absolute urban poverty threshold is between
Rs 600 and Rs 700 per household per month in 6ujarat, which means that
housholds classified by 601 as Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and
Lower Income Groups (LIG) with income below Rs 600 per month fall
beneath the poverty level. In Gujarat this includes at least 40% to 45%
of the urban population.



-11-
2.08    The sites in Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Palanpur and Chodasar would have
independent water supply, and sites in Surat and Ahmedabad would be connected
to the city water supply systems. Sites would be connected to existing water
borne sanitation systems. Electricity networks and street lighting would
also be provided. Community facilities such as primary schools, markets and
health centers would be provided.
2.09    Some core housing would be provided on EWS plots costing Rs 2,200
with optional building loans averaging Rs 2,500 per household. The cores
would consist of a toilet with a water connection. Optional shelter loans
averaging Rs 3,500 per household would also be available to LIG households to
assist self-help construction. Shelter loans provided in the project are
based on assumed rates of uptake of 50% for EWS and 25% for LIG.
2.10    Procedures for the selection of beneficiaries would ensure that the
EWS and LIG plots would be allocated to the designated target income groups.
HIG and MIG plots would be allocated at market prices. Beneficiaries would
be given secure tenure on long-term renewable leases. Assurance was given at
negotiations that beneficiary selection criteria and leasing procedures in
area development would be acceptable to IDA. This would include the
simplification of plot allocation and lease procedures and the reduction of
restrictions on on-plot construction to accommodate the needs of low income
households.
2.11    (b) Town Planning (TP) Schemes. (Base cost:  US$12.77 million;
Rs 15.32 crores). Six TP schemes would be undertaken in three cities (3 in
East Ahmedabad, 2 in Surat and 1 in Ankleshwar). This would include land
re-adjustment and the provision of infrastructure on about 570 hectares.
When fully densified, the sites would accommodate a population of about
300,000. Table II.4 summarizes the proposed investments in TP schemes.

Total                         574.22      1,532.17      297,845
2.12    TP schemes are potentially useful means of developing land through
public/private sector collaboration without the need for costly public land
acquisition, but as presently undertaken the schemes have several limitations
(see para 1.10). The most important of these is the inadequate cost recovery



-12-
which has imposed a large financial burden on local governments. Under the
proposed project, cost recovery would be enhanced. GOG has amended the Town
Planning Act through an ordinance to accomplish the following, and assurance
was given by GOG at negotiations that these measures would be used for carry-
ing out Town Planning Schemes:
(a) the definition of project cost would allow for estimates of cost
increases during implementation;
(b) the interest rate would be tied to a market bank rate;
(c) local governments would be permitted to acquire and lease land in TP
schemes for business and mixed residential purposes; and
(d) cost estimates would include an allowance for off-site infrastruc-
ture.
2.13    TP schemes for the project have been planned using improved design
criteria to eliminate past inefficiencies. Service networks have been
included, and their design is based on full topographical surveys. TP
infrastructure has been planned to coordinate with city infrastructure,
particularly trunk infrastructure serving the sites. Designs have been made
to enhance the value of certain locations which could be acquired and sold or
leased for small businesses.
2.14    Improvements would be incorporated in the processing and implementa-
tion of TP Schemes (see para 1.10). The time required for scheme implementa-
tion would be reduced by GOG administrative order to about 4 years (1 yr. for
Draft Scheme, 15 months for Preliminary Scheme, and 21 months for Final
Scheme). This includes reductions in hearing and review periods which can be
accomplished within existing legislation. Infrastructure construction could
begin after Preliminary Scheme (about 27 months from declaration of Draft
Scheme). Much of the Draft Scheme period should be completed for the schemes
before the project period begins, since planning work commenced in early
1984. The State Government has agreed that the normal assistance by the Town
Planning and Valuation Department in the preparation and processing of these
schemes will be increased. To ensure project completion targets, TPVD will
assign experienced staff on a priority basis. Town Planning Officers who
normally assist only during the Preliminary Scheme period, would be assigned
to assist in all phases including during the final stage with implementation.
An accelerated processing schedule for TP schemes has been agreed to and
included as part of the Operational Action Plan (see Annex 1).
2.15    Additional measures would be assessed during project implementation
to create a more efficient system for processing and implementing TP schemes
over the longer-term. GOG is considering a number of measures for reducing
the processing and implementation period such as reducing the average size of
TP schemes. Reductions in this period will reduce the potential for cost
overrun problems. TPVD is preparing a program for the training of town
planning officers and for acquiring additional equipment for TP scheme
preparation (e.g., survey equipment, aerial photographs, equipment for aerial
photography interpretation) to facilitate scheme preparation. By June 30,
1986, COG will prepare proposals for improvements and a timetable for putting



-13-
them into effect will be discussed with the Bank (see Section B of Action
Plan).
2.16    (c) Slum Upgrading.  (Base cost:  US$10.51 million; Rs 12.61 crores).
About 250 hectares of slums with about 275,000 inhabitants would be upgraded
in five cities and in the area east of Ahmedabad, as summarized in Table
II.5. All slums proposed for improvement except in Ahmedabad are on publicly
owned land. About 50% of the slums to be covered in Ahmedabad are on
privately owned land (25% of all slums to be covered). These are being
acquired through the modification of existing TP schemes.

2.17    In all cities, tenure would be granted to beneficiaries and, since
costs would be fully recovered, the standards of improvements have been
determined in accordance with the communities' needs and abilities to pay.
Layouts take regard of existing land use patterns and community preferences.
Where space is available, additional new plots would be created to accom-
modate displaced and new residents. Displacement and relocation would be
minimal, involving no more than 5% of households in any city's slum program.
2.18    In Ahmedabad, the focus of the program would be to provide tenure
to slum dwellers registered in a 1976 city-wide slum census. Tenure would be
provided with cost recovery upon voluntary request by occupants to AMC. Water
and sewerage connections would also be provided to residents (about 80% of
slum houses are within access of the city's sewerage system; virtually all
have access to the water system). Households participating in the program
would be eligible for home improvement loans to be provided by commercial
banks (outside of project). In neighborhoods where more than 50% of houses
pay for land tenure, community improvements such as improved roads, drainage,



-14-
street lighting and community facilities would be provided and residents
would be charged a betterment tax.
2.19    In Vadodara, Surat, Jamnagar and Jetpur specific slum areas would be
provided with water, roads, footpaths, drainage, sanitation, street lighting
and landscaping. Optional home improvement loans would also be included in
the project. Tenure would be granted on a 50 year renewable basis. Improve-
ments in Vadodara would cover 18 settlements. Three large slum areas would
be improved in Surat, and three slum areas would be covered in Jamnagar
accounting for 80% of the city's slum population.
2.20    An additional six slum areas would be improved in the area east of
Ahmedabad using the same principles as slum improvements in Vadodara, Surat
and Jamnagar. The slum areas would link to trunk and secondary infrastruc-
ture also being provided in the project (see paras 2.30-2.33).
2.21    (d) Solid Waste Management (Base Cost:  US$12.82 million;
Rs 15.38 crores). Improvements to solid waste operations would be carried
out in five cities: Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot and Jamnagar. The
costs are summarized by city in Table II.6. The solid waste management
improvements would provide communal storage bins and a regular collection
service to all areas of the cities. Existing methods would generally be
followed but with improved labor productivity. The "refuse sweeper" system
is common in all of the cities. The brooms, baskets or bins, shovels and
wheelbarrows used by the sweepers would be improved to make work easier, more
hygienic and more productive.

2.22    Community bins would be increased in number and introduced in the two
cities, Rajkot and Jamnagar, where no street storage containers are presently
provided. Bins would be designed to permit easy filling and emptying to
vehicles and to limit animal scavenging. Fleets would be augmented with
vehicles more appropriate for their purpose. Auto-rickshaws adapted for
carrying garbage and able to enter narrow streets would be provided together
with larger tipping trucks. The "roll on-roll off" or "arm roll" vehicle
and container system designed for solid waste operations and currently being
tried in Ahmedabad and Vadodara with some success would become the major
storage and collection mode in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat in areas where
maneuvering space is available. Where distances to available disposal sites
are greater in Surat, Rajkot and Jamnagar and where smaller vehicles would be



-15-
used for the central areas, simple transfer stations would be constructed for
smaller vehicles to tip loads to larger bulk carriers for transportation to
disposal sites.
2.23    Although Vadodara has a compost plant which accepts part of the
city's garbage load, the most feasible mode of disposal in all cities is by
land-filling. However, there is little control at landfill sites. Sanitary
landfill practices would be introduced, including paved access roads,
drainage and other civil works would be carried out at tip sites, and
bulldozers and mechanical loaders would be provided to permit spreading and
covering of garbage.
2.24    A lack of facilities and spare parts and a general absence of
preventive maintenance and vehicle servicing is common. Therefore existing
workshop and garaging facilities would be improved and in some cases new
independent "solid waste vehicle" workshops provided to cope with the
augmented fleets. Major maintenance works would, however, continue to be
carried out by private garages where this practice already exists.
2.25    The private informal sector would continue to reduce the amount of
garbage collected by the Corporations. Private contractors would continue to
be involved in digging compost from disposal sites and marketing it as well
as assisting in vehicle maintenance. Private contractors are unlikely to
become involved in collection on a large scale in the foreseeable future.
They tend to be small, relatively unsophisticated and hesitant to use their
all purpose trucks for garbage. Surat has experimented with private contrac-
tors, but there was erratic service which was difficult to supervise. There
was also alledged exploitation of labor by the contractors which led to the
Government of Gujarat prohibiting the use of private contractors under the
Contract Labor (Registration and Abolition Act 1970). However, many of the
higher income housing society areas engage private contractors directly for
collection and disposal of garbage and this would continue.  For example,
in Jamnagar about 30% of the more compostable garbage is informally collected
by the private sector in bullock carts and sold as compost.
2.26    In addition to improvements in collection, storage, transportation,
disposal and maintenance, the organizational structure of the sector would be
strengthened. In all cities either independent departments, where these do
not exist, or at least independent sub-departments under the Health Depart-
ments are being established and properly staffed. The departments would also
establish small "monitoring cells" which would monitor labor efficiency,
equipment and vehicles, periodically modify practices as necessary and plan
for the future.
2.27    (e) Urban Infrastructure (Base Cost:  US$48.10 million,
Rs 57.72 crores). This would consist of priority augmentations in the
sewerage network in Ahmedabad, priority improvements in storm drainage to
alleviate seasonal flooding in Vadodara and Surat, and priority investments
in water supply, wastewater collection and treatment in the East Ahmedabad
area. Details of the components are summarized in Table II.7.

2.28    (i) Ahmedabad Sewerage.  In Ahmedabad, rapid population growth has
led to overloading of the existing sewerage network and key pumping stations,
particularly in the eastern part of the city which contains numerous slum
areas. The sewerage needs of Ahmedabad have been recognized for some time
and the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 1280-IN) is provid-
ing new trunk sewers and treatment facilities. To ensure these works are
fully utilized as early as possible, to reduce the overloading of existing
sewers, and to provide linkages to slum areas proposed for improvement under
the project, sewerage networks in Gomatipur, Shahibag, Girdharnagar and the
eastern peripheral area would be augmented together with pumping stations at
Gomatipur, Chamanpura and Girdhanagar. These are considered to be the
highest priority linkages required in the city and form part of the long term
sewerage plan for the city prepared by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
and its consultants.
2.29    (ii) Storm Drainage in Vadodara, Surat and Jamnagar.  In Vadodara and
Surat, rapid city growth, illegal encroachments on natural drainage channels
and inadequate storm drainage in TP schemes have led to serious flooding
during monsoon periods. To alleviate the most serious flooding, priority
storm drainage works would be provided. Current drainage designs, practices
and costs have been reviewed and works provided under the project (U-ditches,
pipes and, where absolutely necessary, culverts) would meet hydraulic, struc-
tural and environmental objectives, but at unit costs less than those
presently achieved. The works would relieve the worst hit areas, and they
would constitute the priority phase of longer term drainage plans being
prepared in both cities. In Vadodara, 3200 metres of 1200mm x 1200mm box
culvert; 34400 metres of open trapezoidal channel; and, 420 metres of 600mm
diameter concrete pipe drain would be provided. In Surat, 4950 metres of
single and double box culvert from 1800mm x 1200mm to 2400mm x 2400mm in size
and 9000 metres of concrete pipes ranging in size from 1200mm diameter to
1800mm diameter would be provided. In addition, equipment to improve
drainage maintenance, such as high pressure jetting machines and winch and
bucket machines is being provided. Technical assistance would be provided to
the Surat Municipal Corporation to advise engineering staff in the prepara-
tion of final engineering details and bid documents, and in drainage con-
struction practices and drainage maintenance. In addition, the Jamnagar
Municipal Corporation would be provided assistance for the preparation of a
long-term drainage plan.



-17-
2.30    (iii) East Ahmedabad.  The first phase of a coordinated development
strategy for the East Ahmedabad area would be carried out to begin to address
severe pollution and environmental problems. A trunk sewer and treatment
plant would be provided to accommodate industrial wastewater and domestic
sewerage from about 70 sq.km of the East Ahmedabad area. This proposal was
arrived at after considering various alternatives for dealing with the
present indiscriminate discharge of large amounts of industrial and domestic
wastewater in the area. The alternatives included zonal systems with the
urbanized areas having individual sewerage networks and treatment facilities;
separate domestic and industrial wastewater arrangements; utilization of an
expanded AMC peripheral sewer; use of an improved storm drainage system; use
of different pipe materials to achieve cost savings; and use of the main
irrigation canal (Kharicut) for discharge as an alternative to the Sabarmati
River.
2.31    The solution decided upon was that judged to be the most technically,
economically and environmentally sound alternative. The trunk sewer ranging
from a 900mm diameter pipe to an 1800mm x 1800mm box culvert some 18 km.
long would stretch from Naroda in the north to Narol in the South and deal
with estimated average flows to the year 2001 of about 180 MLD of which
about 90 MLD would be industrial wastewater. The sewer would generally
follow the alignment of the National Highway 8 and would be constructed
within the roadside reserves. A final pumping station would be provided
discharging to a treatment plant where sewage would be treated and the final
effluent discharged to the Sabarmati River at standards acceptable to the
Gujarat Air and Water Pollution Control Board (GAWPCB). The treatment plant
would be constructed adjacent to the AMC treatment facility to be constructed
under the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 1280-IN) on land
owned by AMC.
2.32    In addition to building the trunk sewer, a first step would be made
in addressing the domestic water supply and wastewater problems of three of
the more densely populated settlements. Water supply would be augmented in
the settlements of Naroda, Saijpurbogha and Odhav by the provision of further
tubewells (existing supplies in the region are from groundwater sources and
would remain so for the foreseeable future), and by extensions to the supply
networks. A design standard of 140 lpcd to cover domestic requirements at
year 1991 has been adopted. Sewerage would also be provided in these three
settlements which would ensure that both the existing and increased amounts
of wastewater would be collected and connected to the new trunk sewer.
2.33    Responsibility for implementation of the trunk sewer and treatment
plant would rest with AMC which is extending its boundaries to include
project areas in East Ahmedabad. The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority
(AUDA), using consultants, has prepared the preliminary proposals for water
supply and secondary sewerage. Implementation and maintenance of these
components will also be the responsibility of AMC, and AMC will ultimately
take over all assets created in the area for operation and maintenance.
2.34    (f) Institutional Strengthening/Consultancy Services.  (Base cost:
US$2.44 million; Rs 2.93 crores). This component would include consultant
assistance, equipment and start-up costs in support of the following
activities and agencies (see Annex 10):



-18-
2.35    The Gujarat Housing Board (GHB).  Consultants have begun work on a
review of financial management and accounting systems with the purpose of
designing improved systems. Implementation of the recommended systems is now
being undertaken (see paras 3.07-3.08). Training and equipment would be
provided to improve the technical capacity of GHB.
2.36    The Gujarat Municipal Finance Board (GMFB).  The GMFB would be
provided assistance to enable it to assume a much more important role in
municipal finance and management. A Municipal Finance Analysis and Monitor-
ing Cell (MFAMC) would be established to monitor improvements in municipal
finance under the project. In addition, the project would finance the design
and implementation of a training program for municipal employees which would
be administered by GMFB (see paras 3.13-3.15).
2.37    The Town Planning and Valuation Department (TPVD).  Training would be
financed for TPVD staff to increase the capacity for the design and process-
ing of TP schemes.   Related equipment (e.g. aerial photographs, photograph
interpretation equipment, survey equipment) would also be provided.
2.38    Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).  Consultant assistance would
be provided to AMC for the design of a slum improvement program for the city,
to prepare a low cost area development scheme, to undertake a solid waste
management study, to convert its accounting systems onto an accrual basis.
In addition, assistance would be provided to undertake a long-term housing
strategy for the city. The study would examine overall market trends and the
present supply responses. This would include an examination of the effects
of rent control on housing supply. The results of the Ahmedabad Housing
Strategy Study would be reviewed by GOG, AMC, and IDA by September 30, 1986,
together with a timetable for implementing appropriate agreed recommendations
(see Section F of Action Plan).
2.39    Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA).  Consultant assistance
would be provided to strengthen AUDA.
2.40    Other Municipal Corporations.  Vadodara (VMC) would be provided
consultant assistance to prepare investments in slum upgrading. Consultant
assistance would be provided to Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) to
prepare a comprehensive drainage plan for the city. Surat Municipal Corpora-
tion (SMC) would be provided consultant assistance to advise on engineering
design, implementation and maintenance of investments in storm drainage
(see para 2.29).
2.41    In addition to the above, assistance is being provided in detailed
planning and engineering for East Ahmedabad shelter components, three of the
solid waste management components, and the AMC water and sewerage components
within the present city and in the East Ahmedabad area.
D. Project Costs
2.42    The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated
at US$130.51 million (Rs 156.61 crores), of which US$15.73 million
(Rs 18.88 crores) or about 12% represents foreign exchange costs. Summary

cost estimates are given in Table II.8, broken down to indicate foreign and
local expenditure and duties and taxes.
2.43    Base cost estimates are in March 1985 prices.  Physical contingencies
have been estimated at 10% for civil works with detailed engineering design
and 15% for civil works with preliminary engineering design. Price contin-
gencies have been estimated at 8.5% for fiscal years 1985/86 to 1988/89 and
6% for fiscal years 1989/90 to 1992/93 for both local and foreign costs.
2.44    Layout plans and cost estimates are available for six of seven sites
constituting about 90% of area development. Detailed engineering design is
now being prepared. Planning for the seventh site in Ghodasar will be under-
taken as it is acquired as part of a TP scheme in East Ahmedabad. For TP
schemes, plans and cost estimates have been prepared for four of the six
sites. Planning is proceeding on the remaining two sites, Nikol and Khohra
Memedabad in East Ahmedabad. Detailed engineering will be undertaken during
the initial processing of the TP schemes (see para 2.14). Slum upgrading
plans and cost estimates have been prepared for all the slum areas in
Jamnagar, Surat and Jetpur and detailed engineering is now being undertaken.
For East Ahmedabad and Vadodara, plans and cost estimates have been prepared
for representative slums in the first year's program, and costs were extrapo-
lated for the rest. Planning is now underway for the remainder. For
Ahmedabad slums, preliminary design and cost estimates were prepared for 12
slums in the first year's program containing almost 1,000 households. These
costs were used to extrapolate the total cost for slum upgrading households
over the five year project period. Planning work will be undertaken each
year for the subsequent year's program.
2.45    Solid waste management proposals are based on detailed cost estimates
from feasibility studies for all cities except Ahmedabad where preliminary
estimates were used based on an interim feasibility report. Recent quota-
tions from suppliers and current market prices in India have been used in
base cost estimates for materials, vehicles and equipment. Detailed
engineering and tender document preparation is now being undertaken.
Ahmedabad sewerage proposals are based on detailed plans and cost estimates
by consultants. Storm drainage proposals in Vadodara and Surat are based on
plans and cost estimates for 100% of works. East Ahmedabad trunk sewer,
water and sewerage proposals are also based on plans and cost estimates for
the entire proposal, and detailed engineering is now being undertaken.
E. Financing Plan
2.46    The proposed IDA credit of US$54 million would finance about 50% of
project costs net of taxes and duties. The credit would cover 100% of the
estimated foreign exchange costs and 43% of local costs. The credit would be
made available to GOI which would pass it on to GOG on its standard terms and
conditions as part of the central government assistance to the state. GOG
would make all project funds available to implementing agencies on terms and
conditions indicated in Table II.9. The terms and conditions conform to
current practices. The project amount of Rs 156.6 crores is fully included
in the Plan. The Plan amounts include the agencies' contributions which they
would be authorized to borrow from market sources (through bonds and bank
loans) by GOG. The Flow of Funds is indicated in Annex 11.

F. Procurement
2.47    All contracts for equipment and materials would be awarded under
international competitive bidding procedures with exception of the following:
- Contracts valued under US$150,000 and contracts for supply of fragile
water supply or sewer pipes of stoneware, asbestos cement or concrete
fabrication which are difficult to transport and which are readily
available locally, would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding procedures acceptable to IDA. Irrespective of the pipe
materials and quantities specified at appraisal, for pipes of
diameters 400 mm and above bids will be invited from a range of
materials that include asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron,
steel and pre-stressed concrete.
In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic manufacturers would
be given a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. of competing importers,
or the existing rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. For civil works, a
7-1/2% preferential margin would be given. Contracts for equipment totalling
US$4.4 million would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding adver-
tised locally. This involves materials and items such as handcarts, wheel-
barrows, hand tools and pipes with a large number of local supplies which
would not attract the interest of foreign suppliers. It also includes equip-
ment for which locally available spare parts and maintenance would be impor-
tant. Additional equipment totalling about US$0.8 million involving small
amounts (under US$50,000) would be fabricated by corporation workshops or
procured through normal commercial channels after obtaining quotations from
at least three suppliers (see Table II.10).
2.48    Contracts for about US$73.5 million would be awarded for civil works.
The major contracts would be in connection with the trunk conveyance, treat-
ment and waste water disposal facility in East Ahmedabad (US$13.7 million).
It is expected that these contracts will be large enough to attract the
interest of international bidders. These contracts and other contracts of
value more than US$5 million would be awarded on the basis of ICB. A sum of
about US$59.8 million would be spent on the remaining civil works in the
project. This would include civil works in area development covering seven
sites in six cities spread throughout the state. Contracts for slum upgrad-
ing would be small, spread over numerous slum areas in five cities throughout
the state and phased over a five year period, contracts for TP schemes would
be in six sites in three cities. The largest of these civil works would be
area development in the CHB site at Gorwa (US$3.4 million). Given the
numerous and relatively small contracts to be carried out in 8 towns and the
simple, labor intensive technology, it is not expected that these civil works
contracts would attract the interest of foreign bidders. They would, there-
fore, be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding.
2.49    Local bidding procedures have been reviewed and several areas have
been identified for improvement to make them acceptable to the Bank. The
practice of slicing bids in a manner not in accordance with the clear intent
of the bid documents and negotiating after bid opening would be eliminated.
Bid documents for large civil works contracts with completion times likely to

be in excess of one year would include price adjustment clauses for labor
and materials. Assurance was given at negotiations that procedures for local
competitive bidding under the project would be acceptable to IDA and that for
all contracts valued over 80 lakhs (US$ 667,000) IDA would be provided the
opportunity to review bid evaluations prior to award. In view of the
numerous cities and project agencies involved, the Government of Gujarat
would bring uniformity into the form of documents and procedures through the
Urban Strategy and Project Management Cell (USPMC). This would permit easier
and quicker evaluation of bids and award of contracts.
2.50    Six consultant contracts have been made for project preparation
costing a total of US$175,000, US$34,000 of which was for international
consultant fees. Provision has been made in the project for sustained sup-
port in institutional strengthening (US$125,000) and for detailed engineering
(US$1,117,000), all of which would be locally procured (see Annex 10).
Estimates are based on an average man month rate of Rs 20,000 for local
consultants.
G. Disbursement
2.51    The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against:  (a) 100% of
foreign expenditure for directly imported plant and equipment, and 100% of
local expenditure (ex-factory) for locally manufactured plant and equipment
procured through international competitive bidding; (b) 39% of expenditure
for plant, equipment and vehicles procured through local competitive bidding
or prudent shopping; (c) 39% of expenditure on contracts for civil works;
(d) 39% of expenditure on home improvement loans; and (e) 100% of expenditure
for technical assistance and training and related equipment. Disbursements
for (d) above, for civil works payments not exceeding Rs 600,000 (US$50,000)
for an aggregate value of Rs 100 Lakhs (US$833,000), and for the procurement
of plant, vehicles and equipment not exceeding Rs 300,000 (US$25,000) for an
aggregate value of Rs 100 La<hs (US$833,000) will be made against statements
of expenditure (SOE's), the documents for which would not be submitted to the
Bank but retained and made available for inspection during project supervi-
sion missions. Assurance was given at negotiations that independent auditors
would be retained to carry out annual audits of all SOE's submitted in each
fiscal year and COG would furnish annual audits to IDA within nine months
after the end of each fiscal year. All other expenditure would be fully
documented.
2.52    A schedule for project expenditure is shown in Table II.11.  A
schedule for disbursement of the IDA credit is shown in Table II.12. The
Bank-wide disbursement profile for the urban sector indicates a nine year
disbursement period. A seven year disbursement period is estimated for this
project, which is more consistent with urban project experience in India, the
advanced state of preparation of this project and the implementation capacity
of the agencies invovled.
H. Accounts and Audits
2.53    GHB and the eight local governments would maintain separate project
accounts. The Urban Strategy and Project Management Cell (USPMC) would have
responsibility for reviewing and maintaining audited statements of project

accounts for expenditure made by the implementing agencies. Assurance was
given at negotiations that annual audits of project accounts in all
implementing agencies would be undertaken by or on behalf of the Auditor
General and collected by USPMC and submitted to IDA within nine months after
the close of each fiscal year.
I. Supervision
2.54    About 90 staff weeks of Bank supervision would be required over the
five year project implementation period. This is slightly less than the
South Asia average of 20 staff weeks per year for supervision of urban
projects. It is expected that the arrangement for a strong Urban Strategy
and Project Management Cell (see para 3.02) would help to minimize Bank staff
time.  Some supervision cost would be saved by combining with  he supervision
of the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project.
III.   PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. Project Management Structure
3.01    At the state level the project would be overseen by the Housing and
Urban Development Department. This Department has responsibility for over-
seeing project implementing agencies including local governments, development
authorities and the GHB.
3.02    As has proved successful in the ongoing Madhya Pradesh Urban Develop-
ment Project, the State Government has established an Urban Strategy and
Project Management Cell (USPMC) at the secretariat level to manage the
project. It is headed by a Deputy Secretary and includes two town planning
officers, as well as support staff. The adequacy of this staffing will be
reviewed with COG during project implemenation and adjusted if necessary (see
Section C of the Action Plan). Some members of the team already involved in
the preparation of the project (from TPVD and other project agencies) form
the nucleus of the USPMC. The USPMC has responsibility for finalizing
project formulation, monitoring project implementation, authorizing disburse-
ments to project implementation agencies from funds provided under the State
Government budget and managing separate accounts and progress reporting. The
expertise developed in the USPMC would be useful for reviewing the state's
urban development strategies, planning and implementing future similar
projects and monitoring urban development issues and policies on a statewide
basis.
3.03    The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) has coordinated the
preparation of the investment program in the East Ahmedabad area during
project preparation. AUDA would continue this involvement with the planning
of TP schemes and shelter components in the East Ahmedabad area.
3.04    Some aspects of the project would be managed at the state level by
the GMFB (see paras 3.13-3.15). GMFB would be responsible for financial
analysis and related technical assistance to municipal corporations and
municipalities and it would administer a training program for local govern-
ment employees. Legislation for the GMFB has recently been amended to enable



-28-
it to act as a financial intermediary between the State Government and local
governments. Due to its lack of experience, it has not been given this role
for this project, but it is expected to build expertise for such a role in
the future. TPVD would assist local governments from the state level in the
planning and processing of TP schemes (see para 2.13).
3.05    HUDCO would not be involved directly as financial intermediary in
this project as it is in Madhya Pradesh, although HUDCO has prepared designs
for two of the area development projects. Bank involvement with HUDCO con-
tinues in the supervision of the Madhya Pradesh project. However, GOI and
HUDCO felt that HUDCO's resources and other commitments would not allow it to
commit itself to the same financing plan as in the Madhya Pradesh Project
(67% of project cost from HUDCO without Plan additionality).
B. Implementation Responsibilities
3.06    The primary responsibility for individual project components would
lie with the following agencies:
Project Management    -  Housing and Urban Development Department
- Urban Strategy and Project Management Cell (USPMC)
- AUDA (planning for East Ahmedabad)
- GMFB (for Municipal Finance and Training)
Area Development       -  GHB (Vadodara and Ankleshwar), SMC, AMC, AUDA
(E. Ahmedabad), Palanpur Municipality
TP Schemes             -  TPVD (scheme processing)
- SMC, Ankleshwar Municipality, AUDA (for implementation)
Slum Upgrading         -  AMC, VMC, SMC, JMC, AUDA, Jetpur Municipality
Urban Infrastructure  -  SMC, VMC, (storm drainage)
-  AMC (for secondary sewerage and East Ahmedabad
water and sewerage)
Institutional
Strengthening        -  GHB, TPVD, AMC, SMC, East Ahmedabad, AUDA, JMC,
GMFB (see paras 2.34-2.41)
C. Project Agencies
The Gujarat Housing Board
3.07    The GHB would implement two of the proposed area development schemes,
including the largest (44 ha) in Vadodara and one in Ankleshwar (see para
2.06). Until now GHB's program has been weighted towards the construction of
completed housing for upper and middle income groups. Shelter intended for
low income households has been affordable only with large capital and inter-
est subsidies. Experiments with sites and services schemes have met with
limited success. The schemes proposed for this project, stressing more
efficient design and management, would seek to overcome past deficiencies.



-29-
3.08    GHB has serious problems with financial management.  There is a lack
of adequate planning and budgeting, and information for management is inade-
quate for proper control. A separate system of accounts is being established
to maintain adequate control of project funds. However, over the longer term
the project is assisting to improve GHB's overall financial management.
Consultants have begun work to review financial and managerial problems at
GHB, and they are expected to make preliminary recommendations early in 1985
including an integrated accounting system based on full project cost account-
ing with the allocation of overheads and other costs to projects, and
improved debtor accounting. They will also recommend a system of budgetary
control and long-range planning. Implementation of a new project cost
accounting and budget control system would be completed by April 1, 1986 (see
Section D of Action Plan). As these measures are put into effect, it is
expected that GHB will experience earlier fructification of assets and
improved recoveries from debtors. This should lead to gradual improvement in
GHB's financial position as outlined in Annex 7.
Municipal Corporations and Municipalities
3.09    The cities of Gujarat are not overly dependent on State Government
grants (grants were 12% of total revenues in Ahmedabad in 1983/84 and 15% in
Surat and Vadodara). However, much of this limited reliance on grants can be
explained by the inadequate levels of service and maintenance provided.
Therefore, preparation of the project has included the analysis of complex
issues related to municipal finance (see para 1.13) and the preparation of
financial projections for the project cities to assess the potential short-
falls in revenue (see Annex 6). During project preparation, a number of
measures have been implemented to strengthen the financial position of local
governments, the effects of which are shown in the financial projections.
These include the enacting of legislation by GOG to partially delink property
valuations from rent control by allowing actual rental values to be used
where they are higher than controlled rents. AMC has also taken a number of
administrative actions to improve tax administration and to reduce expendi-
ture.
3.10    It will be important to ensure that local governments will be able
to cover the costs of improvements and extensions of service and maintenance,
and debt service under the project without increasing their reliance on
grants. To assure this, agreement was reached at negotiations that COG will
cuase local governments to take appropriate action to ensure that, with
effect from fiscal year 1985/86, total expenditure chargeable to revenue
account will be covered by local taxes and charges and normal government
grants and that thereafter the revenue accounts of the involved local
authorities will be kept in balance. To begin to achieve this end, COG has
recently amended the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations (BPMC) Act
through an ordinance to introduce minimun charges for water and to raise the
minimum conservancy charge and to introduce an interest penalty on property
tax arrears (items 1 and 2 of the Operational Action Plan, Annex 1, Section
E). The Action Plan includes a Municipal Finance Program (Section E) which
would be undertaken to enhance municipal finance and which would be monitored
by GMFB. GMFB would also monitor the implementation of revenue enhancement
measures after they are enacted.  In the case of Ahmedabad, it is estimated



-30-
that the quantifiable measures in the Action Plan would generate an addi-
tional Rs 8.8 crores of revenue per year by 1990/91 (7% of total revenues)
which would be roughly sufficient to cover expenditure. Rs .5 to 2 crores
of this would be attributed to the minimum charges for water and conservancy
and to the interest penalty described above. A similar impact would be
expected in other cities (see Annex 6). Assurance was sought at negotiations
that the entire Operational Action Plan, Section E will oe followed (see para
2.04).
3.11    The Gujarat Municipal Finance Board has begun to undertake analysis
of local governments' taxation practices and recommend to the State Govern-
ment where improvements can be made. Analysis by GMFB has shown that
improvements in assessments and collections would be possible in many cities.
The Operational Action Plan includes specific targets for improving collec-
tions (see items 7 and 8, Section E).
3.12    Although the recent amendment to the Municipal Corporations Act
enables the corporations to value rental property on the basis of actual
rent, this is only a first step towards more fundamental changes in property
valuation. Further measures which would begin to change the method of
property valuation for some types of property (especially commercial and
industrial) are being considered. Steps toward drafting and introducing such
measures also form part of the Operational Action Plan.
The Gujarat Municipal Finance Board (GMFB)
3.13    GMFB has a broad mandate, but as yet it has had a limited role in
improving municipal finance (see para 1.13).   Under the project, GMFB would
be strengthened in several ways. First, the GMFB Act has been changed to
enable it to take a more active role in project identification and finance
in the local governments. To build GMFB's capacity for this role, it has
been involved in project preparation for the three municipal towns. (GOG
prefers not to involve GMFB as a conduit of funds in this project in order to
limit the complexity of funds flows.)
3.14    Until now GMFB has dealt mainly with municipalities, and data
collection and analysis has been largely descriptive. Under the project,
GMFB would initiate a Municipal Finance Analysis and Monitoring Cell (MFAMC)
which would analyze potential financial improvements for both municipal
corporations and municipalities. The Cell would analyze municipal resources
and expenditures, maintain and extend the municipal finance and statistical
data base which has been created during project preparation and monitor the
Municipal Finance Program (see paras 3.09-3.12).
3.15    GMFB would also administer a training program for municipal manage-
ment and finance. Similar to the program being carried out under the Madhya
Pradesh Urban Development Project, this program is being designed to cater to
various levels and disciplines in urban management. TPVD is also being
involved in the program to assist with training for urban planning.



-31-
The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)
3.16    AMC, which would implement several components under the project, is
also a project agency under the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(Credit 1280-IN). Since solid waste management investments, which would be
financed from general municipal revenues, would be undertaken by AMC, the
finances of AMC are being examined as part of the Municipal Finance Program
(see para 3.10). In addition, the financing of AMC's water supply and
sewerage operations has been reviewed in connection with the ongoing project.
3.17    An operations and management study of AMC's water supply and sewerage
investments has been undertaken, and the recommendations have been imple-
mented (e.g., decentralization of repair and maintenance functions to zonal
offices, introduction of a new management information system, a revised
staffing pattern and a new materials management system). Under the ongoing
project, AMC agreed to a doubling of revenues from water and sewerage opera-
tions from the 1981/82 base year to March 31, 1984. This has been 65%
accomplished. Although rates have been doubled, revenues are lagging partly
due to legal challenges to property valuations. AMC expects most legal
challenges to property taxes to be resolved by early 1986, which would sig-
nificantly contribute to meeting this covenant by March 31, 1986. Under the
existing water supply project, AMC is also commited to covering the cost of
operations, maintenance and depreciation from water and sewerage charges by
March 31, 1988 and covering the cost of operations, maintenance and debt
service, excluding depreciation, by March 31, 1993. At negotiations, these
targets were confirmed. AMC has agreed to undertake a detailed assessment of
the measures required to meet the targets.
3.18    AMC is extending its boundaries to include the project areas in East
Ahmedabad. Assurance was given at negotiations that COG will cause AMC to
implement, operate and maintain project works in the East Ahmedabad area. A
timetable was also agreed for the full extension of AMC authority into the
area (see Section C of the Action Plan).
3.19    At present much of the cos- of water supply and sewerage operations
in the area are being met from general revenues. The area is not covered
under the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 1280-IN).
Preliminary financial analysis for the proposed water supply and sewerage
operations has been made during project preparation (see Annex 6). Given the
area's large industrial base, the objective of full cost recovery should be
attainable. Agreement was reached at negotiations that for East Ahmedabad
water supply and sewerage operations GOG will ensure that by March 31, 1991
the cost of operations and maintenance, including 50% of deprecitation or
debt service, whichever is greater, are covered by charges on industries and
water and conservancy taxes on the users of the facilities. The costs of
operation, maintenance and 100% of debt service will be met by March 31,
1993. It was also agreed that by June 30, 1986 AMC will assess the measures
required to meet these targets (see Section C of the Action Plan).
The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA)
3.20    During project preparation AUDA's role as metropolitan development
coordinator has been strengthened by placing AUDA in charge of planning for



-32-
the area east of Ahmedabad. With the expansion of AMC's boundaries, AMC will
now be responsible for implementation in the East Ahmedabad area, but AUDA
will continue with the planning of TP schemes in that area. As part of
project preparation a study was undertaken of AUDA's financial management and
organization.
Town Planning and Valuation Department (TPVD)
3.21   TPVD has an especially important role to play in the planning and
processing to TP schemes, and its ability to do so would be strengthened
under the project (see para. 2.37).
IV. PRICING, AFFORDABILITY AND RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
A. Pricing and Cost Recovery
4.01    About 80% of total project cost would be recovered from beneficiaries
(45% through payments in land development and shelter components and 35%
through user charges in water and sewerage components). The interest rates
on shelter loans to beneficiaries and on betterment taxes (outlined below)
would be higher than in existing programs and positive in real terms, since
the average rate of inflation over the project period is expected to be well
below this level. Price contingencies for the project period range from 6%
to 9%.
4.02    Area Development.  Full cost recovery would be achieved in area
development schemes. This would demonstrate a methodology which could later
be extended on a larger scale for reducing the high levels of subsidization
in land and housing development (see para 2.07). Approximately 96% of the
total cost of this component would be directly chargeable (land, site
preparation, on-site infrastructure, off-site infrastructure, on-plot
development and shelter loans). Land would be costed at market prices (up to
Rs 80 per square meter compared to Rs 10 per square meter typical in past
projects. Overheads would be included in costs to be recovered. Interest of
not less than 12% would be charged, which is expected to be positive in real
terms, since the annual inflation rate during the period is expected to be
less than 7%. The rate is well above the 4% to 6% now charged in similar
projects. Cost recovery at this level would be made affordable through
appropriate designs and a system of differential land pricing with upper
income and business plot beneficiaries paying higher than average costs. The
terms of plot charges and loans would include: (i) for residential plots and
shelter loans for EWS, LIG and MIG households, an average 10% downpayment on
the price of the plot with the balance of the plot price and loan amount (if
any) to be repaid at not less than 12% p.a. interest over 20 years; and
(ii) for HIC and industrial and commercial plots, a 30% downpayment with the
balance to be repaid at not less than 12% p.a. over 15 years. Assurance was
given at negotiations that terms and conditions of lease and hire purchase in
area development would be satisfactory to IDA including that interest of not
less than 12% p.a. would be charged to beneficiaries.



-33-
4.03    The remaining cost of community facilities (4%) would not be directly
recovered, but some cost of off-site infrastructure would be recovered
through user charges.
4.04    Town Planning Schemes.  The high subsidies in TP schemes (see para
1.10) would be eliminated by changing the basis for calculating betterment
tax, including the cost of off-site infrastructure, enabling local government
to recover part of the cost in the form of land and charging a market
interest rate instead of the present 6%. Costs would then be fully recovered
through betterment taxes and land sales with interest of about 12% per annum
charged on unpaid betterment tax balances. Since the TP legislation would be
changed, cost recovery would also be improved in TP schemes not included in
this project.
4.05    Slum Upgrading.  Slum improvements have been designed to be
affordable with full cost recovery. The cost of improvements and a near
market price for land would be recovered through plot charges at a 12% inter-
est rate. The value of publicly owned land to be charged to beneficiaries
would range from Rs 50 to Rs 100 per square meter in Ahmedabad and from Rs 20
to Rs 60 in Jamnagar, Surat and Vadodara, depending on the location.
Assurance was given at negotiations that in slum upgrading the cost of land
and improvements would be recovered, that terms and conditions of lease would
be satisfactory to IDA and that interest of not less than 12% p.a. would be
charged. Shelter loans would also be repaid at 12% over 20 years. This
would be the first direct recovery of the costs of slum upgrading in Gujarat.
4.06    Water Supply, Sewerage and Maintenance.  Municipal governments will
assume the responsibility for maintenance of area development sites and
upgraded slums. Assurance was given at negotiations that water supply and
sewerage facilities developed in area development sites would be taken over
for management by local governments or housing cooperative societies and
prevailing water ans sewerage rates would be charged to beneficiaries with
individual connections. In slum upgrading, facilities will be transferred to
local governments and prevailing rates will be charged. Since about 80% of
beneficiaries would be exempt from normal property taxes, the maintenance
fees would supplement the municipal governments' resources for operation and
maintenance.
4.07    Cost recovery for secondary sewerage infrastructure in AMC would be
linked to terms set out in the ongoing Gujarat Water'Supply and Sanitation
Project (see para 3.17). The cost recovery program for proposed water and
sewerage investments in the East Ahmedabad area is described in para 3.19.
B. Affordability
4.08    Area development sub-projects have been designed so that about 65% of
plots would be affordable to EWS and LIG households with incomes of less than
Rs 650 per month (about the 40th percentile), with basic monthly charges
starting at about Rs 25.00. Basic monthly charges for upgraded areas would
be about Rs 18 and Rs 25 for 12 m2 and 20 m2 plots and would be affordable to
households earning Rs 350 and Rs 450 per month, respectively.



-34-
4.09    Affordability analysis and indicative charges for the largest area
development in Vadodara are given in Table IV.1. Table IV.2 gives affor-
dability analysis and indicative charges for a typical slum upgrading site
in Surat.
C. Resource Mobilization
4.10    The costs of solid waste management and maintenance would largely be
recovered through the general revenues of the municipal governments (although
some costs of water supply, sewerage and maintenance would be met by user
charges). The project includes a major effort to improve the general revenue
of the local governments, as explained in paras 3.09-3.12.
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01    The immediate benefits of the proposed project would be to increase
the supply of developed land, primarily for low income groups; to improve the
living conditions of 275,000 slum households; to improve solid waste manage-
ment and storm drainage in the the major cities of Gujarat; and to provide
priority investments in sewage disposal and treatment, and water supply in
the area east of Ahmedabad. The long term benefits include improvements in
the system for urban land development (with public agencies concentrating on
efficiently designed site development for low income groups, leaving house
construction to the private sector, and achieving more efficient
public/private sector collaboration in town planning schemes). Secure tenure
and cost recovery would be introduced in slum upgrading projects, and these
and other municipal services would be planned and implemented more effi-
ciently. The system for urban management and finance in Gujarat would be
strengthened, including improved financial management in CHB, improved
municipal resource mobilization, improved local government in the East
Ahmedabad area, and a new capacity at the state level (in the USPMC, GMFB and
TPVD) to prepare, finance and supervise urban development programs and to
provide technical assistance and training to local governments.
5.02    The project would have an important impact on poverty groups in
Gujarat (see Annex 9). The area development component would serve about
79,000 persons, about 75% of whom fall below the estimated poverty level,
providing them with shelter, basic services, primary and secondary education
and health care. The average per household cost of plots, core houses and
loans would be Rs 13,200 (US$1,200). Investments in town planning scheme
infrastructure would benefit an ultimate population of about 325,000 persons,
about 50% of whom fall below the poverty level. Slum upgrading schemes would
provide basic infrastructure and sanitation to about 300,000 persons, about
95% of whom fall below the urban poverty threshold and many of whom have no
access to basic sanitary facilities. The average per-household cost of
upgrading plus building loans would be Rs 2,300 (US$190). Investments in
solid waste management would improve environmental and health conditions for
a population of about 4.5 million (50% below poverty level), and investments
in storm drainage would benefit a population of about 610,000 (60% of whom
below poverty level). Investments in sewerage infrastructure in Ahmedabad
would benefit a population of about 900,000 (60% below poverty level). Water

supply and sewerage infrastructure would benefit a population of about
630,000 in East Ahmedabad (65% below poverty level). Over 4.3 million urban
poor would benefit from the project; about 63% of project cost would directly
benefit poverty groups, and 55% of the beneficiaries will be poor.
5.03    Economic rates of return have been calculated for the main components
of the project. Area development components would have an ERR of 13%.
Benefits were estimated using market information on rental values of
completed houses and on the sales prices of developed land. The planning
techniques introduced in this project (see para 2.07) have reduced costs by
minimizing underutilized space (wide streets, large open spaces, etc.) while
carefully maintaining the amenities most valued by beneficiaries. At the
same time, features valued by upper income groups and small businesses have
been designed into the schemes. The designs are, thus, much more economi-
cally feasible than previous similar projects in Cujarat. Sensitivity
analysis indicates that if the market rent levels were 10% less than
estimated, a 12% ERR would still result.
5.04    For TP schemes, land market information has been used to calculate
the difference between the existing land and plots after urbanization. Such
information is routinely collected as part of the TP scheme process. This
yields an ERR of 29%, reflecting the high return on this type of land
development in an environment of very constrained supply. Even assuming land
values of 10% less resulting from the project, an ERR of 18% would result.
The higher ERRs than in area development reflect the different market seg-
ments being addressed.  The high rates of return in TP schemes reinforce the
argument for at least recovering investment costs from beneficiaries.
5.05    For slum upgrading, rental market information was used to determine
the difference in rental value between existing residential and commercial
structures before and after upgrading. This yields an ERR of 17%. Sen-
sitivity analysis indicates that rent levels of 10% less after upgrading than
those estimated would lower the ERR to 11%.
5.06    For the proposed trunk sewer in East Ahmedabad, a similar methodology
was used estimating the increases in land market value attributable to the
investment and including the value of increased user charges by landowners.
This yields an ERR of 16%.
5.07    The risks to which the economic rate of return is considered most
sensitive would be slippage in the realization of benefits relative to the
timing of costs incurred, although the likelihood of such an occurrence is
considered low, given the high and inelastic demand for shelter and basic
services.  A more likely occurrence would be for both costs and benefits to
be delayed together, in which event the rate of return would not be sig-
nificantly altered. To demonstrate the effects of a more extreme case, for
example, a one year lag in benefits (plot allocation and sales) in area
development with the timing of the costs remaining the same, the ERR would be
reduced from 13.0% to 10.6%. Together the quantifiable components of the
project account for 58% of total costs and have a weighted ERR of 18.6%.
These rates of return may not fully account for the benefits from improved
health as well as the many indirect and longer-term benefits resulting from



-38-
the demonstration of new planning and investment strategies and the
strengthening of urban sector management (as outlined in para 5.01).
5.08    A major risk relates to the complexity of the project and the
capacity of the project management and implementing agencies. Because of
concern about potential complexity, several components and one additional
city discussed during project preparation were deleted. A relatively simple
project management and flow of funds system has been established (see para
3.02). Although the capacities of some agencies at the state and local
levels are limited, state and local governments in Gujarat are relatively
well managed compared to other states, and the project would further
strengthen them, especially in their financial management. The largest
institutional risk factor related to the requirement for a consolidated local
government in the East Ahmedabad area. Assurances have now been received
from GOG that AMC will implement, operate and maintain project components in
the area.
5.09    Land acquisition has proven risky in most urban projects in India,
but much more land for area development has been acquired prior to appraisal
in this project (about 79%). Almost all of the land for area development not
yet acquired is for the proposed area development scheme in Ahmedabad. To
accelerate acquisition of this area, a draft revised TP scheme has recently
been approved by AMC, and letters of consent have been received from owners
of about 50% of the land. About two-thirds of the slums proposed for upgrad-
ing are on municipal or Government land. The remaining one-third are on
privately owned land in Ahmedabad (65% of the proposed Ahmedabad slum
program) which AMC is acquiring through modifications of existing TP schemes.
Declarations of intent to modify all the existing 27 TP schemes have been
made and AMC now has 36% of the slum land in its possession, enough for the
first two years work.
5.10    The need to plan, process and implement the town planning schemes
within the project period poses some risk since these schemes have taken 5 to
10 years in the past. For this reason, special assurances of staffing and
priority are being sought from GOG, and simplifications in the processing
system would be pursued under the project (see para 2.14). Especially to
accommodate these schemes, a five year project period has been chosen.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01    The following agreements were reached at negotiations:
(a) GOG would submit quarterly reports to monitor progress in project
implementation and to indicate progress on the implementation of
actions contained in the agreed Operational Action Plan (Annex 1) to
be adhered to by GOG and the state and local agencies under the
project; the Operational Action Plan would be reviewed and updated
annually by GOG and it would be satisfactory to IDA (see para 2.04);



-39-
(b) The proposed area development sub-projects would receive necessary
GOG and local planning, engineering and building approvals as
appraised (see para 2.07);
(c) Beneficiary selection criteria and leasing procedures in area
development would be acceptable to IDA (see para 2.10);
(d) In Town Planning Schemes (a) the definition of project cost would
allow for estimates of cost increase during implementation; (b) the
interest rate would be tied to a market bank rate; (c) local govern-
ments would be permitted to acquire and lease land for business and mixed
residential purposes; and (d) cost estimates would include an
allowance for off-site infrastructure (see para 2.12);
(e) Procedures for local competitive bidding under the project would be
satisfactory to IDA; for all contracts valued over Rs 80 lakhs (US$
667,000), IDA would be provided the opportunity to review bid evalua-
tions prior to award (see para 2.49);
(f) Independent auditors would be retained to carry out annual audits of
all SOEs submitted in each fiscal year and COG would furnish annual
audits to IDA within nine months after the end of each fiscal year
(see para 2.51);
(g) Annual audits of project accounts in all implementing agencies would
be carried out by or on behalf of the Auditor General and collected
by USPMC and submitted to IDA within nine months after the close of
each fiscal year (see para 2.53);
(h) COG would cause local governments under the project to take
appropriate action to ensure that, with effect from fiscal year
1985/86, total expenditure chargeable to revenue account will be
covered by local taxes and charges, and normal government grants,
and that thereafter the revenue accounts of the involved local
authorities will be kept in balance (see para 3.10);
(i) GOG will cause AMC to implement, operate and maintain project works
in the East Ahemdabad area (see para 3.18).
(j) For AMC water supply and sewerage, the cost of operations, main-
tenance and depreciation will be covered from water and sewerage
charges by March 31, 1988 and the cost of operations, maintenance and
debt service, exluding depreciation, will be covered by March 31,
1993 (see para 3.17)
(k) In East Ahmedabad water supply and sewerage operations, GOG will
ensure that by March 31, 1991 the cost of operations and maintenance,
including 50% of depreciation or debt service, whichever is greater,
are covered by charges on industries and water and conservancy taxes
on the users of the facilities. The costs of operation, maintenance
and 100% of debt service will be met by March 31, 1993 (see para
3.19)



-40-
(1) Terms and conditions of lease and hire purchase in area development
would be satisfactory to IDA including that interest of not less than
12% p.a. would be charged to beneficiaries (see para 4.02);
(m) In slum upgrading the cost of land and improvements would be
recovered; terms and conditions of lease would be satisfactory to
IDA; and interest of not less than 12% p.a. would be charged (see
para. 4.05); and
(n) Water supply and sewerage facilities developed in area development
sites would be taken over for management by local governments or
housing cooperative societies, and prevailing water and sewerage
rates would be charged to beneficiaries with individual connections.
In slum upgrading, facilities will be transferred to local goverment
and prevailing rates will be charged (see para 4.06).
6.03    On the basis of the above agreements, the project would be suitable
for an IDA credit to GOI of US$62 million.

FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
A. AHMEDABAD MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
1.      The projections for Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation are based on
actual figures abstracted from their Accounts to 1983/84, on the revised
budget for 1984/85 and the latest budget for 1985/86. They include
projections of the financial impact of the extension of AMC's boundaries.
AMC's accounts are kept on a cash basis but AMC tend to exercise rela-
tively good financial control and to be up-to-date with their accounting.
Their accounts, therefore, represent a reasonably reliable indication of
the financial position of AMC.
2.      The projections have been prepared as for:
Table 1 - AMC's General Revenue Account showing the annual
surplus/ deficit for general services, water account and
sewerage account. These latter two accounts have been
kept separate only since 1981/82, as required under the
Gujarat Water Project (Cr. 1280-IN). AMC keeps separate
accrual accounts for water supply and sewerage. These
are kept as separate ledgers since they cannot be
balanced with the corporation's cash accounts.
Comments on the Financial Position to 1983/84
3.      Between 1981/82 and 1983/84, AMC ran surpluses on its General
Revenue Account excluding water and sewerage services. During these
years, the Water Account deficit rose from Rs 809.90 lakhs to Rs 925.58
lakhs and on Sewerage Account the deficit was reduced from Rs 283.11 lakhs
to Rs 262.17 lakhs.
4.      During this period, overall recoveries of outstanding debtors'
accounts (excluding debts under litigation) was about 65%. However, there
is a considerable underrecovery on both the sewerage and water accounts,
and arrears. During the three years 1981/82 to 1983/84, provisions for
bad debts of some 40% have been made and AMC still face the difficult task
of recovering outstanding debts.
Projections through 1993/94
5.      The base projections include an inflation rate of 8 1/2% to
1986/87 and 8% thereafter and allow for a population growth rate of 3 1/2%
throughout the whole period. It is anticipated that service requirements
will increase in accordance with these rates. General property tax is



-66-
ANNEX 6
page 2
less buoyant and is expected to grow at 3% through 1990/91. Water tax and
conservancy tax are expected to increase in accordance with requirements
of the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project at the rate of 15% per
annum throughout the period. An allowance has been made for bad debts on
water and sewerage account which would bring the net position of these
accounts to reflect the actual position in AMC's cash accounts.
6.      There would be a surplus on the General Revenue Account throughout
the period but this would be more than offset by projected deficits on
water and sewerage accounts which will leave a net deficit on Revenue
Account for each year of the provisions if no further revenue enhancement
action is taken by AMC.
The Bank-Assisted Project
7.      The General Revenue Account sets out the financial effects of each
of the components of the proposed Bank assisted project which would have
to be financed from General Revenue Account. Running expenses for solid
waste management include an allowance for depreciation of equipment. The
additional on-going financial burden is relatively small in relation to
the overall expenditure programmes for AMC's services. However, given
AMC's financial projections, further effort would be required to enhance
revenues.
Revenue Enhancement Measures
8.      AMC are aware of the need to improve their recoveries of property
taxes which are currently about 65% of recoverable demand. AMC has agreed
to seek ways of improving recoveries on the following schedule:
70% by 1985/86
75% by 1986/87
80% by 1987/88.
9.      The recent measures taken on delinking property valuation from the
effects of rent control should produce an increase in the property value
base in real terms. AMC have indicated that a 7 1/2% increase per annum
would be attainable.
10.     AMC are also pursuing measures to improve octroi collections.
These include seeking legislation to enable specific penalties to be
levied for octroi evasion. Administrative measures such as the appoint-
ment of more octroi inspectors have recently been introduced. This should
enable a modest improvement in octroi of at least 1 1/2% per annum.



-67-
ANNEX 6
page 3
11.     AMC are also proposing that the education cess service charge
which it receives from the State Government should increase from one-third
to one-half of collections.
12.     AMC is pursuing a disposal of property programme which will con-
siderably assist its finances during the project period. AMC wishes to
bring the whole of its capital receipts into its Revenue Account, but Bank
missions pointed out that this would be unsound financial practice and
they have therefore been excluded. However, there will be considerable
additional tax and rental income from the development and sale of
property. AMC have estimated that this would increase income by Rs 200
lakhs in 1986/87 to Rs 400 lakhs in 1990/91.
13.     AMC have introduced stringent establishment control measures which
should produce savings throughout the project period.
14.     It can be seen, therefore, that there is considerable scope for
improving the income and containing the expenditure of Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation. The measure proposed would be sufficient virtually to
eliminate the total deficit on revenue account as well as to finance the
on-going revenue expenditure in the Bank-assisted scheme. Further
improvements in the water and sewerage accounts which are expected under
the project but are not fully portrayed in these accounts would enable AMC
to finance an increasing percentage of capital expenditure from internally
generated resourses.
B. VADODARA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
Revenue Account Projections
15.     The basic assumptions for the projections for the Vadodara
Municipal Corporation (VMC) are the same as for AMC.
16.     Without improvement measures, the Revenue Account would be in
deficit by 1985/86 and have an increasing deficit through 1990/91.
17.     However, with project improvement measures similar to those
dicussed for AMC, especially increased conservancy and water taxes,
increased octroi collection, and the introduction of minimum charges for
water and conservancy, the deficit could be substantially reduced. Addi-
tional minor changes in the rate of capital investment and in revenue
collection would eliminate the deficit.
C. OTHER MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS
18.     Similar projections have been prepared for Surat, Rajkot and
Jamnagar showing the impact of the proposed project and the impact of
proposed revenue enhancement measures.

GUJARAT HOUSING BOARD
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS THROUGH 1990/91
1.      Financial projections for the Gujarat Housing Board have been
based on actual accounts between 1979/80 and 1983/84. During this period,
the Gujarat Housing Board kept its accounts on a hybrid cash/accrual
system which does not truly reflect its financial position. In addition,
some financial practices have distorted the financial results of the
Housing Board.
2.      The projections have been prepared as follows:
- CHB Revenue Accounts showing the net revenue account
for each year
- GHB balance sheet
- GHB Sources and Applications of Funds Statement.
Comments on the Financial Position to 1983/84
3.      The actual accounts from 1979/80 through 1983/84 show that except
for 1982/83, GHB was running a surplus on its Revenue Account. However,
these figures are not a true reflection of its financial position.
Although it is difficult to precisely establish the true position, it is
estimated that there were actual losses of between Rs 30-50 lakhs per
year.
4.      In addition, it is clear that GHB have relied on the use of
deposits as a means of financing current schemes. GHB can eliminate these
problems by adopting sound financial practices and they are currently
being assisted to do so by consultants.
Projections through 1990/91
5.      Projections have been prepared to show the financial performance
of GHB through 1990/91. These are based on a capital investment programme
given by GHB. In preparing the projections, it has been assumed that
there will be a proper system of cost recovery which has been determined
in two ways. Firstly, an average profit on capital investment of 8% has
been included in hire purchase capital recoveries (ranging from a
break-even on EWS to 15% on HIG). Secondly, a differential of 1/2%
between borrowing rates and lending rates has been included. It is
assumed that the average cost of new loans will be 11% which is consistent
with present costs of funds and the impact of the proposed project. An
average rate of recovery from beneficiaries of 11 1/2% over 10 years has
been assumed.

6.      The projections show that by adopting sound financial practices
and with a proper cost recovery system, the CHB can move into, and main-
tain surpluses throughout the period.
Bank Assisted Project
7.      In terms of its overall capital programme, the component of the
Bank-assisted project is relatively small and could be easily accommodated
within the financial constrants of the Housing Board if the improvements
in financial management under the project are properly implemented.

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Area Development
1.      Economic analysis has been undertaken for the Corwa site in
Vadodara (Baroda) which represents 44% of the cost of this component.
Costs include the estimated market price of unimproved land (Rs 49 per
square meter) and estimated civil works expenditure in the project, phased
from 1985 to 1988. In addition, it has been estimated that individual
plot recipients would invest an average of Rs 2500 of their own resources
in home improvement. These latter costs would be phased from 1988 to
1990.
2.      Benefits were estimated to be represented by incremental rents
on two types of improved units. A total of 1904 EWS units would have a
market rent of Rs 80 per month, and 892 LIG units would have a market rent
of Rs 170 per month. These benefits would begin to be realized in 1987
(as the project nears completion) and reach their full amount by 1990.
The rents were based on analysis of equivalent market rents in nearby
residential areas.
3.      The market price of non-residential and high income plots would
represent an additional benefit to the project. For non-residential land,
market prices were estimated to range from Rs 90 per square meter for land
provided for public facilities to Rs 700 per square meter for land in the
best location for commerce. Market prices of high income plots were
estimated to vary from Rs 155 to Rs 275 per square meter. These prices
were estimated from land valuation data available with the Town Planning
and Valuation Department which is routinely collected for Town Planning
Schemes. The benefits to be realized from land sales are expected to be
realized between 1987 and 1988. In the design of area development com-
ponents, care has been taken to maximize the value created for
non-residential and high income residential purposes. In similar projects
in Cujarat, little attention was paid to using high potential areas such
as land near busy intersections for high value purposes. The new practice
has enhanced both the economic and the financial feasibility of the
schemes.
4.      The above analysis yielded an EER of 13%.  Some of the values of
benefits were then subjected to sensitivity analysis. It market rents
were 10% less than estimated, an EER of 12.% would result. If market
rents were 10% higher than estimated, an EER of 13.9% would result. If
plot occupation and land sales were delayed and benefits were lagged one
year with costs incurred as originally estimated, an EER of 10.7% would
still result. This is a pessimistic assumption, since delays in plot
occupation would probably be associated with comparable lags in costs.
The low EER relative to TP schemes reflects the intentional creation of
benefits mainly for low income groups. Land development schemes for a



-88-
ANNEX 8
Page 2
broader market segment (such as TP schemes) typically have greater rates
of return.
Town Planning Schemes
5.      Economic analysis has been made using a typical TP scheme ac the
Fulpadra site in Surat. The costs include civil works in land development
phased from 1986 to 1989. Benefits include the increment in value between
the market value of raw land before the scheme and the market value of
both residential and commercial land after the scheme is implemented.
This benefit is expected to be realized between 1989 and 1992. Market
values for raw and serviced land adjacent to TP schemes are gathered
routinely by the Town Planning and Valuation Department for use in the
financial calculations, and this information was available for use in the
cost/benefit calculations. The market values assumed in these calcula-
tions were considered to be somewhat conservative due to the systematic
understatement of values in land transactions. However, since estimates
of both original and improved land values are affected, the distortion of
EER calculations is limited.
6.      The EER calculated in this manner is 29.1%.  Sensitivity analysis
shows that if the benefit (land value) were 10% less the EER would be
17.9%. If it were 10% higher, the EER would be 38.9%. The high rates of
return reflect that this type of project is a means of breaking supply
constraints in an extremely constrained land market. They also reinforce
the argument for full cost recovery in this type of project so that all of
these benefits are not bestowed on landowners at government expense.
Slum Upgrading
7.      Cost/benefit analysis for slum upgrading proposals is based on a
typical slum in Limbayat, Surat. Costs, phased from 1985 to 1988, include
civil works for slum improvement and an estimate of the pre-project market
value of land to be sold for commercial use. Cost also includes the
expected cost of home improvements to be made by beneficiaries, phased
from 1986 to 1988.
8.      Separate benefit streams were estimated for each of four residen-
tial unit types. This was done by estimating the market rental value of
each type of shelter before and after upgrading, based on a rental market
survey undertaken by the Ahmedabad Study Action Group.   In addition, the
sale value of improved land for commercial use was included as a benefit.
9.      An ERR of 16.8% was calculated.  Sensitivity analysis was con-
ducted to assess the impact of higher or lower market rents. If benefits
(as estimated by market rents) were 10% less, an ERR of 11.0% would



-89-
ANNEX 8
Page 3
result. If market rental value were actually 10% higher, an EER of 22.8%
would result.
East Ahmedabad Trunk Sewer
10.     Costs for this component were estimated to include capital expen-
diture (civil works, equipment, and a market price for land) phased from
1985 to 1988. Estimates also include running expenses beginning in 1989.
Benefits include industrial and domestic user charges. Benefits also
include the increased value of land benefiting from the project, but it is
assumed that much of this value would be taxed away from landowners in the
form of user charges, especially to industry.
11.     Based on an analysis of land use patterns in the East Ahmedabad
area carried out by AUDA consultants, the catchment area of the sewer is
calculated as 70 sq.km.   About 60% of this land is assumed to be
marketable (the rest being roads, canals, etc.). Abo'it 30% of this
marketable land is residential land which is expected to be sufficiently
impacted by the project to have its value enhanced. Of this, 1/3 would
have a 10% increase in value and 2/3 would have a 5% increase. These
estimates were based on observations of market land prices (which are
routinely gathered by TPVD for planning TP schemes in the area) both near
and at some distance from the worst sources of pollution. They are con-
servative, given the very large pollution and health problems, especially
on land adjacent to industrial areas.
12.     A conservative estimate of industrial and residential user char-
ges, based on data collected by AUDA's consultants, was used. To be
conservative, it was assumed that all of the benefit to industrial land
was captured by the user charge and no additional benefit would be real-
ized from increases in industrial land value.
13.     The above assumptions yielded a 15.6% EER.  The rate of return
represents the expected large benefits, especially from eliminating a
serious and wide-spread industrial waste disposal problem which has been
long neglected in a rapidly urbanizing area.
