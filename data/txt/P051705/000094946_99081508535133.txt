Foreword
Zhangzhou-Zhaoan expressway is an important section within Fujian province of
the national trunk road from Tongjiang, Heilongjiang province, to Sanya, Hainan
province. Zhangzhou-Zhaoan expressway connects other three expressways of
Xiamen-Zhanngzhou, Quanzhou-Xiamen and Fuzhou-Quanzhou in the north, and the
expressway of Shantou-Chaozhou, Shantou-Shenzhen in the south, forming an
expressway corridor from the capital city of Fujian to Guangdong province, Hong
Kong and Macao, linking the south-east area of Fujian province with the Zhujiang
river delta area, to bring into full play of the important function of "window" opening
to the outside world of the special economic zone in the area, which is of great
significance to both Fujian and Guangdong provinces, as well as the coastal area's
economic development.
Zhangzhou-Zhaoan expressway is the Fujian Provincial Highway Project n with
the World Bank loan. The Zhangzhou-Huaan Section (Tankou-Chengguan) is one of
the Other Highway Project of the Project II. The road project will further improve the
road network condition with higher capacity to accommodate the increasing traffic to
help speed up northern area's economic development of Zhangzhou.
Entrusted by the project owner, the Research Institute of Highway (RIOH) of the
Ministry of Communications (MOC) undertakes the environmental impact assessment
for the attached project. In December, 1998, with the assistance from the project
owner, the Fujian Communications Planning and Design Institute (FCPDI), and
relevant departments of the local government, the EIA working group from the RIOH
conducted an on-site investigation of the area along the road, visited such sensitive
spots as villages, schools, hospitals and etc., canvassed opinions and suggestions of
the public on the proposed road project, land acquisition and resettlement policy and
the environmental protection measures, and collected materials relevant to the EIA
work, on the base of which the Statement of the Environmental Impact Assessment
for the Huaan Section of Zhangzhou-Huaan highway was accomplished in February,
1999. In March, 1999 the EIA working group had discussions with the environmental
expert from the World Bank, with amendments made to the Statement of EIA done in
February, 1999, based on the advice from the expert. We would like express our
appreciation to all those who gave us support to make the EIA work success.

1.5 Classification of the EIA
In accordance with the classification of the EIA work as required by the World
Bank for road improvement project, this project involves with reconstruction of the
existing road passing through such sensitive spots as resident area; therefore it is
necessary to compile the EIA report and the environmental action plan (EAP).
In accordance with the classification of the EIA for special subject as specified in
the "Technical Guidelines for IEA", the EIA for the ecological environment
(including water environment) should be Class m; the EIA for acoustic environment
should be Class II; and the EIA for ambient air quality should be Class III.
1.6 Assessment method
In the environmental impact assessment, the principle of "combining points with
lines, representing road section with typical points" shall be adopted. Assessment of
current status is based on survey and statistic analysis; with modeling and analogue
methods for forecast and assessment of noise and ambient air impact; analogue
method for water environment; survey and statistic analysis for social economic
environment. Some indicators or values exceeding the standard limits may also be
used in the assessment.

2. Engineering Brief
2.1 Alignment and main control points
The Zhangzhou-Huaan section starts from the border area of Zhangzhou and
Huaan at the opposite bank of Tankou (the original Zhang-Hua route k23+200),
towards the upstream direction along the Jiulongjiang river, via Qianzhe (k25+750),
to Taikou k28+140. The original alignment will generally be followed with necessary
modification of straightening, widening and newly added pavement. A new bridge of
the same type will be built at the upper stream of the existing bridge; and the two
bridges will share the up-stream and down-stream traffic respectively. After the bridge,
the route shall be once again along the original route, via Jianmei k29+400, Dakeng
k32+400, to Xiazhangkou k36+400. The route continues along the river, via Shakeng
k40+000, Xinlai k43+ 400, Waishe k50+800, where a new tunnel of 170m long and a
new Huangzao bridge (5 span - 245.5m) are to be built, after which, the road will have
a separate interchange with the railway, to Xinyu k55+700. Starting from k56, the
road will be rising with high embankment via Shapuwei at k57+250; the rising
gradient continues until the Hongqishan Huaan power plant area. The road will go
into a 2,180m tunnel at k57+900, on the left side of the mountain. After the tunnel. the
original temporary road used for the railway construction will be used and
reconstructed connecting with the existing road. A small bridge is to be built to cross
over the Wuya Dongkou of the power plant, linking with and along the inner side of
the existing road, with pavement widened; in paralell with the gutter drainage of the

2.4 Major construction work amount
2.4.1 Subgrade
Since some of the road section is along the river side, the subgrade design is
mainly controlled by flood, bridge and the earth / stone filling. The road has little
longitudinal fluctuations, with the maximum longitudinal gradient being 3.5%. The
subgrade width is 12m, and the gradient of cut side slope is dependent on the
geological conditions, as well as the height and the materials of the filling. For earth
side slope, it is 1:0.5, 1:0.75 or 1:1.15; for stone side slope, it is 1:0.25, 1:0.33 or 1:0.5.
Total earth and stone work amount for the subgrade is 1,784,200m3.
2.4.2 Drainage protection
Design of longitudinal and horizontal drainage for the subgrade is done taking
into consideration of the layout of bridge and culvert. Drainage ditches are to be set on
both sides of fill embankment (no drainage ditch on the river side). Drainage ditches
are to be set on both sides of the subgrade of cut section, with interception ditch on the
top of the slope. Chute and water drop well are to be built with stone pitching, to
make sure the water flow swiftly, as well as proper strength and stability of the
subgrade. Total earth and stone work for the drainage protection is 55,088m3.
2.4.3. Pavement
The carriageway width of the road is 9m with cement concrete pavement.
2.4.4 Bridge
There are a total of 28 bridges to be built for the road with a total length of
1,082.6m, of which 2 are large bridges, i.e. Huangzao bridge, 245.5m long;
Taikou bridge, 131.8m long; 12 are medium bridge, with total length of 429.02m;
14 are small bridge with total length of 277.0m.
2.4.5 Tunnel
Two tunnels will be built with total length of 2,350m. One is 2,180m long, with
geological features of surrounding rock of V, IV kind; another is 170m, with

2.6 Identification and classification of environmental impact
According to the on-site investigation and analysis, the enviromnental impact
factors for the Project can be summarized as follows.
At the design stage, the impacts to be considered and identified are those arising
from such factors as the alignment of the road involving permanent and temporary
occupation of land and woodland, resettlement of residents, which will have impact
on the land use, farming, community life and the natural landscape.
At the construction stage, the impacts to be considered and identified are those
arising from the engineering construction work, such as damage to the surface
vegetation and the wild life habitat and soil erosion caused by cutting and filling work,
which may also change the water flow and quality; the dusts and noises caused by the
construction machines, which will have impact on the nearby school students and
residents; the construction machine will have impact on the existing road traffic,
which will increase the accident risk; and the engineering construction work will also
cause inconvenience for the local residents. The construction work for some sections
along the Jiulongjiang river will have negative impact on the soil erosion of the area
and on the river water quality.
At the operation period, the impacts to be considered and identified are those
arising from the traffic, such as the impacts of noise and air pollutants from the
vehicles and vehicle emissions, CO, NOx, and etc.; and due to the fact that it needs
time to recover the vegetation, soil erosion may still exist. The pavement run-off will
have negative impact on the Jiulongjiang river water quality.
According to the engineering and enviromnental features the main environmental
impacts can be identified as shown in Table 2-7.

3. Environmental Conditions and the Current Status Assessment
3.1 Natural and geographical conditions
3.1.1 Meteorological condition
Huaan county is located in the north periphery of the southern sub-tropic area, a
transition area from the southern sub-tropic area to the mid Asia tropic area. The
landform in the north-west being higher than that in the south-east forms a screen to
protect the south area from being affected by the north cold air, greatly weakened the
cold air influence. The Jiulongjiang river passes through the mid area in south north
direction. The meteorological condition is characteristic of hot humidity maritime
monsoon with a lot of rain in summer, evergreen plants all the year round,
progressively increasing thermal distribution and decreasing rainfall distribution from
the north-west to the south-east, and frequent disaster climate.
The meteorological conditions based on the statistics of the Huaan county
Meteorological Bureau are as follows.
(1) Temperature
Annual average temperature is 20.8 C;
Extreme highest temperature 40.61C (July 18, 1988);
Extreme lowest temperature - 3.81C (January 2, 1963);
The hottest month is July, with monthly average temperature of 28.2 C;
There are 23 days per year with temperature high above 35 C.
(2) Rainfall
Annual average rainfall is 1,631.5mm;
The maximum rainfall per year is 2,124.3mm(1961);
The maximum rainfall per month is 620mm (September, 1961);
The maximum rainfall per day is 1,992mm(June 25, 1985);
There are average 18.4 days per year with rainfall greater than 25mm;
The rainy season is from May to June, and the typhoon season (after flood season)
is from July to September.
(3) Wind
Annual average wind speed is 1.5m/s; the prevailing wind is in north-east
direction with frequency of 9%, maximum speed of l Om/s.
(4) Fog
The average foggy day per year is 15.6 days.
(5) Relative humidity
The annual average relative humidity is 79%.
3.1.2 Hydrological condition
The proposed road is mainly along the North Stream of Jiulongjiang river.
10



The North Stream of Jiulongjiang river is 274km long, of which 107km are
within Huaan county area, with drainage area of 9,640km2. Its annual average run-off
volume is 209m3/s; with historic lowest run-off volume of 171 m3/s; historic highest
water level of 99.4m and the maximum run-off volume of 11,500m3/s.
3.1.3 Landform and geological condition
(1) Natural geography
Huaan county, located in the south-west of Fujian province at the middle reaches
of the North Stream of Jiulongjiang river, is one of the satellite counties of Zhangzhou
municipality. It borders on Changtai county in the south-east, with Anqi county to its
north-east, Zhangping municipality to its north-west. The Yingtan-Xiamen railway
and the North Stream of Jiulongjiang river pass through the county area in south-north
direction. It is 77km from Zhangzhou and 127km from Xiamen special economic
zone.
(2) Landform
The road area is hilly with hills and low mountains with elevation over 20 - 150m
and that of mountain peak over 300 - 600m. The gradient of the hills is over 15 - 300,
and there are steep cliff and precipice to form steep V-shaped valley. The North
Stream of Jiulongjiang river is all the way through along with the road. The river bed
in the low land area of the mountains is broad and wide with a lot of alluvial gravel
and sands.
(3) Geological structure
T=he area is located at Zhouning Huaan block heave belt, with Variscan - Indo-
Chinese epoch development, Yanshan epoch east direction fault, with 8 bands of fault
passing through the road alignment. The F8 fault of Indo-Chinese epoch is nearly
orthogonal with the alignment of the Hongqishan tunnel. The width of fault crush
zone is over 130 - 150m.
(4) Hydrological and geological condition
The underground water in this area can be classified into pore phreatic flow from
Quatemary system sliderock crushstone, rubblestone, and alluvial sand gravel; pore
water from basement rock weathered zone; crevice water from fault crush zone and
joint fissure. Spring usually occurs around ravine and low land areas, which is kind of
pore space water from alluvial layer with small run-off volume fluctuating from
season to season, depending on the main source of rainfall.
(5) Poor geological phenomenon
:(i) There are a total of 14 sections with high side slope for the road, some of
which are of soil side slope at the upper part with rock foundation and the depth of the
top layer soil is over 6- 8m. Therefore, consequent landslide may occur at the soil
rock interface.
II



(ii) The bury depth of Hongqishan tunnel is over 150 -280m. Since 200m is
usually known as the critical depth for rock burst to happen, stress measuring shall be
conducted for the tunnel section with bury depth over 200m at next step to assess the
issue of rock burst.
(6) Engineering geological assessment
(i) The foundation condition of the road is good and no soft ground has been
found in the whole route area.
(ii) The basement rock is bare for most of the bridge location, most of which are
weathered rock, except for some individual bridge location with surface of gravel and
Sandy gravel layer with depth over 3 - 5m without soft weak layer underneath.
3.1.4 Earthquake
The earthquake intensity in this area is usually of VII degree.
3.2 Ecological environment assessment
3.2.1 Investigation and assessment of the current status of flora and fauna
Within the highway project area there are original cover plant of sub-tropic rain
forest and broad-leaved forest (evergreen broad-leaved forest), most of which are in
remote mountain area, far from the projected road. The secondary cover plants mainly
are sub-tropic evergreen broad-leaved tree, secondary leaf-fall broad-leaved tree,
secondary masson pine tree, Chinese fir, mixed broad-leaved and coniferous forest,
bamboo forest. The main cover plants of cash forest are tea-oil tree, tung oil tree, tea
garden, fruit tree, bamboo and etc. There are 242 families, 1,089 attributes and 2,698
genuses, of which 42 families, 87 attributes and 206 genuses for pteridophyta; 8
famnilies and 22 genuses for gymnospermn; 192 families, 891 attributes and 2,438
genuses for angiospermous; and also included are 400 genuses of medical plant and
67 genuses of rare plant.
There are 19 species of animal, 20 species of bird, 39 species of fish, pests and
other animals, of which 35 species are the wildlife protected by the State and the
province.
Owing to the production activities and everyday life of the human being, within
the road area there is no original forest and the wildlife under protection, and the
cover plant in the area is dominated by planted woodland and agricultural crops, with
the cover rate less than 30%.
3.2.2 Investigation and assessment of the current status of the land use
Total land area of Huaan county is 1,951,806 mu, of which 193,208 mu are farm
land, accounting for 9.9%; 82,075 mu gardens, accounting for 4.2%; 1,161,889.1 mu
12



woodland, accounting for 59.53%; 47,186 mu water area, accounting for 2.4%;
426,102 mu unused land, accounting for 21.85%. The analysis based on the
investigation shows that the main features of the land use in Huaan county are as
follows.
(1) The hilly area is dominated by woodland, with some planted cash forest; and
the farm land is dominated by paddy, followed by those for peanuts, sugarcane and
tobacco.
(2) The land use rate is relatively high!, with low plantation rate, with the land use
rate for the whole county area being up to 78.17%, and the plantation rate being only
9.9%.
(3) There are many kinds of farm land, unevenly distributed and restricted by the
landform. Most of the farm land are on both sides of the river, the basin area in the
mountains, hillside, and the low land area, sporadically distributed, usually with deep
gradient.
3.2.3 Investigation and assessment of the agricultural resources
Plantation is the major agricultural production in Huaan county and the main
crops are rice, wheat, sweet potato, soybean, corn, potato; the cash crops mainly are
tea, sugarcane and tobacco, followed by peanut, and cassava. The gross output value
of agricultural product was CNY 410.16 million in 1997, of which CNY 46.12 million
was the output of the forest industry, CNY 104.46 million of animal husbandry, CNY
19.21 million of fishery.
There are a number of soil types in the area, mainly including red soil, loess,
alluvial soil, paddy soil, and etc.; of which the red soil is widely distributed.
3.2.4 Investigation and assessment of the current status of water and soil erosion
The area of water and soil erosion in the county once reached 244,674 mu. After
many years efforts, the area with water and soil erosion being under control has been
reached 172,231 mu. However due to limited investrnent and slow process of the
cover plantation growing, it is necessary to strengthen control of water and soil
erosion. The red soil loss is mainly caused by water erosion, mostly in hilly area,
particularly for the red soil evolved from granite and purple sandy vanadinmica. The
module of soil erosion is over 402.5 - 484.2t/km2 * y.
3.2.5 Current status of the Jiulongjiang river water quality
The Jiulongjiang Beixi river, where the highway project is located, is not the First
Class and the Second Class water source prection area. The nearest Huaan water
source is 2km away at the upstream of the river. The water from the river nearby
the road sections is mainly for industrial and agricultural use.
13



The Zhangzhou Municipal Environmental Monitor Station has set up 5 water
quality monitor sections, two of which are in the road alignment area (Xinyu section
and North 12 section). The water quality data monitored (provided in March, 1999)
are summarized in Table 3-2-1.

It can be seen from Table 3-2-1 that all the monitored data from the two sections
are within the standard limits of Class I1I of GB3838-88, which indicates that the river
water quality is good to meet requirements for its function.
3.3 Current status assessment of acoustic environment and ambient air quality
Along the road area most are rural area with villages and some scattered resident
spots in small scale. Only over some broad flat land such as Huangzao, Xinyu and etc.,
there are relatively densely populated resident areas, with the resident buildings on
both sides of the existing Zhang-Hua road, forming street highway. The road traffic is
the main source of the noise and the pollutants. On the whole the current status of the
acoustic and air environment is good along the road area.
There are 13 acoustic environmental monitoring spots distributed at critical points,
14



along the Zhangzhou-Zhaoan expressway, of which the geographical and
environmental features of the monitoring spots of Guanyinting, Waifenglou, Gaolin
High School and Andou Primary School are similar to those of this highway project
area, therefore according to the analogue method in the EIA, analogue method can be
used to assess the current status of the acoustic and air environment, i.e. to assess the
current status for the road project by use of the existing enviromnental monitoring
results from the above mentioned four monitoring spots.
The measured results from the four monitoring spots are as follows: day time
average noise level of 48.1dB(A) and thgt of night time 40.1dB(A); the day time
average noise level around the schools 47.8dB(A) and night time average noise level
of 40.6dB(A). The average value noise level is up to Class I standard level, which
indicates good acoustic environment quality.
There are 4 ambient air monitoring spots at critical points, along the Zhangzhou-
Zhaoan expressway, of which the geographical and environmental conditions of
Guanyinting are similar to those of this highway project area, with measured results of
one hour average concentration of CO over 0.75 - 1.12mg/Nm3, daily average
concentration of CO over 0.84 - 1.03mg/Nm3; one hour average concentration of
NOx over 0.005 - 0.015mg/Nm3, daily average concentration of NOx over 0.005 -
0.012mg/Nm3; daily average concentration of TSP over 0.018 - 0.048mg/Nm3. It can
be seen that the concentrations of the pollutants of CO, NOx, and TSP are relatively
low, and the ambient air quality is good.
3.4 Current status assessment of social environment
3.4.1 General condition
Huaan county is located in the far north mountain area of Zhangzhou municipality
bordering on Zhangping county of Longyan municipality, with the mountain area
accounting for 89% of the whole county. In accordance with the concrete situation a
mountain area based economic development strategy has been formulated with the
"North Stream 50 km Bamboo Industry Corridor" and the "18,000 mu Longan Belt
along the River" as the emphasis to develop bamnboo and wood products, fruits, edible
fungus, vegetable, tobacco, sugar, aquatics breeding and green food products, with
great achievements having been achieved. Total grain output reached 76,970 ton, 358
kg per mu and per capita output 0.485 ton in 1997, ranked in the second place in
Zhangzhou municipality. The forestry industry. is developing well with forest covering
rate of 59%, with store volume of 3.5063 million mi3. The industry has got rich
hydraulic power resource, with hydraulic power supply of 558,730,000 kwh in 1997.
The Huaan Hydraulic Power Station is one of the large power plant with annual
average power supply of 360,000,000 kwh. Three manufacturing industries of bamboo
and wood, jade, and food have been developed, with total annual output value of CNY
280.75 million, accounting for 37.39% of the whole industry output. In addition, there
are rich stone material resource in the area, particularly the calcareous-silica hornfelse
15



from "Jiulongbi" (nine dragon wall) is a typical decorative stone material, looks like
marble, much better than granite in terms of appearance quality and dense texture,
good for both handicraft articles and high grade buildings. At the foot of a hill and
beside a river the county has potentials for its tourism resource.
The overall economic strength has been enhanced over the six years of 1992 -
1997, with gross domestic product increased from CNY 220 million to CNY 651.97
million (1990 constant value), increased by 196.35%, with annual average growth rate
of 24.27%. The output value of industry and agriculture increased from CNY 363.58
million in 1992 to CNY 1149.85 million in 197, increased by 216.26%, with annual
average growth rate of 25.89%. Export oriented economy is also developing. In 1997
there are 4 newly established Chinese foreign joint ventures in the county with
contracted foreign investment of USD 4.16 million and actual utilization of foreign
capital of USD 3.1 million. Table 3-4-1 show the summary of the economic indicators.

4. Expected Environmental Impacts and Protection Measures
4.1 Ecological environmental impact assessment
4.1.1 Assessment of impact on land use
It is inevitable for the road project to occupy the land permanently or temporarily,
and the land used for the road will lost its original function, which will have impact on
the farm production, ecological environment, as well as the social economic system.
Particularly, the farmland is precious in Fluaan county with per capita land and farrn
land ownership only 12.32 mu and 1.22 mu respectively; and the per capita farm land
ownership for the highway project area being less than 1.2mu. Total land occupation
of the road project is 1,104 mu. In addition to the existing road, acquisition of 167.5
mu land will be needed, of which 33.1mu are farm land (including paddy, dry land
and pool). According to the on-site investigation, the road alignment basically goes
along with the Jiulongjiang river, confmed by the landform. Therefore very little farm
land will be included in the land acquisition, with some only for temporary use. And
there are unused land which can be developed to mitigate the impact on the farm land
loss.
As for the impact of the lead emissions from the traffic on the farm land soil on
both sides of the road, according to the study report made by the Research Institute of
Highway of the Ministry of Communications, the lead content in the farm land soil on
both sides of the road will be very small, far less than the Class II standard limit as
required in the State standard GBI6518-1995 "Soil Environment Quality Standard"
even in the long term operation period. At present more and more unleaded gasoline
are used in China, and by the year of 2000, leaded gasoline will disappeared in the
market as required by the State regulation. Therefore the impact of lead on the road
side farm land soil will be very small in the road construction and operation period.
4.1.2 Assessment of impact on fauna and flora
Owing to the land occupation and the cutting and filling work in the construction
period particularly for the widened subgrade, some cover plant will have to be
damaged. However, due to the fact that one side of the road is beside the Jiulongjiang
river and the other side is at the foot of hill slope, where the cover plant is few;
therefore, on the whole the impact arising from the road project on the cover plant is
small, and the damage caused by the road project will be mitigated by plantation and
greening engineering work, taking advantage of the local humidity and warm climate.
Because of the human being's activities along the road project area, there is no
rare and big animals around the area. There will be impacts on small ones such frog,
bird, pest during the construction period, which will migrate to other places for the
time being and once the cover plants are resumed, they may come back.
4.1.3 Assessment of impact on water and soil erosion
(l) Analysis of the factors to cause water and soil erosion
18



The main factors cause soil erosion during the road construction period are
rainfall and engineering work.
The road project area is located in the transition area from the southern sub-tropic
area to the mid sub-tropic area, with annual average rainfall of 1,631.3 mm and the
rainy season from May to June with rainfall accounting for 40% of the year total. It
can be expected that the months of May and June will be the period with most of the
soil erosion during the construction period over the year of 1999 - 2001. The
engineering work refers to the necessary cutting and filling work for subgrade, bridge,
culvert, and tunnel. Proper treatment will have to be made to prevent the soil from
being eroded. Table 4-1-1 lists the summary of the way of soil erosion caused by road
construction.
Table 4-1-1 Summary of the way of soil erosion caused by engineering construction

3. The extent of the erosion will increase with the growth
of depth of cutting and filling

2. Subgrade treatment for culvert, or clear away the soft 2. Undervater construction work will cause resuspension

water and soil erosion.

2. Disposal of the spoils.                             2. Local loss will be great.

3 The spoils are usually slack and easy to be eroded.
(2) Potential soil erosion intensity and erosion forecast
The mostly applied in the world, the U.S. universal soil erosion equation is used
here to estimate the soil erosion.
A=R  K*Ls*C*P
where: A   -   erosion intensity (ton/km2  year);
R   -   rainfall erosion factor;
K   -   soil factor, for highway, K=0.42 - 0.46, here 0.44 is taken;
Ls -   landforrn factor, a function of surface run-off and gradient, as
follows
L
Ls  (            )m  (65.4sin2O + 4.56sinO + 0.065)
22.1
where: L   -  lenght of the eroded slope (m);
O   -   gradient of the eroded slope.
19



Since most of the highway sections are to be reconstructed based on the original
road, with road subgrade of 12m, in hilly area, the area of l Om from both sides of the
road center line shall be considered in the estimation. Before the highway construction
0=120, L=10.4m, m=0.5m; after the highway is completed 0=37.00 (gradient 1:1.5),
L=4.8m, m=0.8m. The calculation shows that before the construction started, Ls=1 1.3,
in the construction period, Ls=7. 1.
C - surface coverage factor, since the existing road pavement and road side
have cover plants, before the construction is started, C=0.4, in the copnstruction
period the pavement and the cover plants are t6 be damaged, C=1.0.
P - water and soil retention factor, before the construction is started, the
ground is flat and compacted, P=0.7, in the construction period, P=l.0.
To calculate the equation under the assumption of the given parameters, we can
get the soil erosion intensity before and after the construction is started, and the
changing rate of the growth:of the soil erosion intensity.
A2BF    RK2LS2P2C2       0.44 x 11.3 x 1.0 x 1.0
=6.3
AIAF    RKILSIPICI       0.4 x 7.1 x 0.7 x 0.4
The maximum soil erosion intensity in the construction period will be 6.3 time as
much as that before the construction is started, i.e. the erosion will increased from
402.5 - 484.2ton/km2 _ year before the construction to 2,535 - 3,050ton/km2 * year,
which shows that the local soil erosion will be great and that it should not be
neglected. Given the construction period of two years (May, 1999 - May, 2001), the
width of the soil erosion area being twice as much as that of the subgrade, the soil
erosion in the construction period may be up to about 2,538.0 ton - 3,055.Oton.
However the actual soil erosion will be smaller than this figure; it is because that (i)
cutting and filling area in the first year will be less than that of the estimation, and the
subgrade will be compacted layer by layer; (ii) the side slope protection and the
drainage engineering system will be carried out concurrently; (iii) the greening
engineering work will be implemented to ensure resume of the cover plants, which
will reduce the loss of soil erosion. But owing to the fact that many of the road section
is close to the Jiulongjiang river, the soil erosion will have direct impact on the river
water quality, it is necessary to take every measure to reduce the soil erosion in the
construction period.
(3) Analysis of the spoils of the engineering work
The highway project is based on the reconstruction of the exiting road, with
straightening and widening work, which will have moderate amount of cutting work,
only limited to areas of widened subgrade areas. For reconstructed road the transport
20



conditions is relatively better, and the spoils from cutting may be used for fillings;
therefore the amount of the spoils will not be great.
Most of the spoils come will from the two tunnels. The Hongqishan tunnel is
2,180m long, with earth and stone work amount up to 12,927m3; the Xinanban tunnel
is 170m long with earth and stone work amount up to 10,081m3. To make full used of
the cut earth and stone from the tunnels, and to deal with the spoils, high road
embankment scheme is adopted at both ends of the tunnels, to have not only reduced
the spoils to the minimum, but also improved the alignment of the highway. Therefore,
the spoils disposal has been controlled quite well, but still effective should also be
taken to reduce the negative impact arising from the spoils.
4.1.4 Assessment of impact on water environment
(I) The impact of soil erosion on water quality
The impact arising from construction of the road project on water environment,
mainly include the affected rivers, farm land, ditches, and etc.; and the impact may be
caused to happen in two ways: water and eroded soil flow from construction worksite
directly into the nearby farmland; rill erosion of soil and sand flow into river or distant
farm land by way of irrigation system.
There are several section of the highway being alongside the Jiulongjiang Beixi
river, with culverts acrossing over four tributaries of Zhuxi, Tiangongxi, Xianxi,
Luoxi and a number of farmland irrigation channels, which will not cause partition or
cut-off of the exiting irrigation and river system. However, the construction of these
bridges and culverts will cause soil erosions and impact on the water quality. The
highway sections alongside the river are as the following.
(i) The section from K23+200 to K57
The start point and the section of K30 - K31 are alongside the river. Such
measures as to build earth retaining wall should be taken to prevent the earth and
stone from falling into the river during the construction period.
The rest of the highway sections are 20- lOOm away from the river, with the
altitude of the pavement 15 - 25m higher tahn that of the water level; therefore the
probability of direct falling into the river for the earth and stone is small; but still in
rainy season the eroded soil may flow into the water body to cause turbid.
(ii) The highway section over K57 - K61
This section is the Hongqishan tunnel and its entry and exit areas. Although there
is no direct impact on the river water area, the high embankment scheme will have
potential soil erosion and indirect impact on the river water, particularly in rainy days.
Therefore, construction of this section should not be done in rainy season.
21



(iii) The highway section from K61 to the end point of K64+930
This section is based on the the original temporary road used for the railway
construction, which is far away from the river.
(2) Analysis of the impact caused by bridge construction and the labour camp
Local river substrate silt resuspension will occur in the beginning of the bridge
construction caused by piling or cofferdam construction, which will have negative
impact on water quality. Study shows that the "turbid flow" produced by construction
of large bridge is usually 150 - 200m long. Taking inaccount of the characteristics of
the Beixi river, which is narrow with swift flow, the impact area may be greater, but it
is limited in hundreds of meters. Since the construction machine is usually powered
by electric motor, without mineral oil leakage, only with little lubricant, the impact
arising from gasoline spillage or leakage will be little on water quality.
The sewage and wastes from the labour camp and the construction site may be
brought over into river to cause water pollution. Given the construction labours of
200 - 500, the daily water consumption will be 18 - 45 ton, so the daily sewages may
have negative impact on the river water and should be treated properly.
The dusts arising from subgrade construction and construction material transport
may also be brought over into the river, which will have impact on water quality.
However, on the whole this kind of impact is temporary and slight.
(2) Analysis of the impacts during operation period
During the operation period, the emissions and dusts from the traffic will be
dispersed with wind and drop into river to have impact on water quality; however, the
quantity of the pollutants is very small, with little impact. The oil spillage over the
road pavement and the particles from worn tires of road vehicles may also be brought
into the river by way of the drainage system. The pollutants from pavement run-off
mainly are suspended solids, oil, organic substance and lead, and etc., with their
concentration depending on such factors as road traffic volume, rainfall intensity, dust
deposition, duration of previous dry season, and etc..
Because the highway project area is abundant in rainfall with short period of dry
season, the amount of the pollutants in the pavement run-off is relatively small.
According to the measurement of the downstream river water quality from a number
of bridge sites, the water quality indicators usually meet the Class III standard of
GB3838-88, except for SS, which usually has slight exceedings over the Class I
standard of GB5084-92. Since the highway has designed with drainage system,
guiding the pavement run-off into the tributary streams of the Jiulongjiang river, the
direct negative impact on the trunk part of the river will be avoided.
In addition, the Jiulongjiang river bed is wide, with its water flow being swift and
22



stable, which possesses strong dilution, dispersion and self cleaning capacity, the
impact on water pollution cause buy the road project will be small, with slight impact
on the Jiulongjiang water quality, even if it is under the extreme unfavorable rainfall
conditions.
4.2 Forecast and assessment of acoustic environment
4.2.1 Analysis of acoustic environment impact during construction period
The main noise source during road construction period is from road construction
machinery, with the extent of the impact depending on such factors as work time
schedule and progress, the equipment used, as well as the worksite location and the its
distance from the sensitive points of village, school, and etc.. By way of on-site
investigation and comparison analysis, the first raw of resident houses near the road
will have the most significant impact, for the sensitive spots of Huangzao, Xinyu

will have certain impact
4.2.2 Environmental impact assessment in operation period
(1) Forecast and assessment of traffic noise
The traffic noise forecast shall be made by using the forecast model as follows:
N1           rO
Leqi(d) = LAi + lOlg(-) + lOlg(   )  + AS - 13
TVi          r
N1          ro         ro
Leqi(n) = LAi + lOlg(-) + 151g(-)+ lOlg(    )a + AS - 13
TlVi        r           r
The noise level grade of the overall traffic noise at point P shall be:
3
Leq(t) = 10 lgE 10 .ILeqi
i =l
where: Leqi(d)  equivalent noise level, produced by i-type vehicle at forecast point P
by day (dB);
Leqi(n)  the equivalent noise level as mentioned above by night;
LAi   average maximum noise level of i-type vehicle at reference point,
(dB);
Ni    average hourly traffic of i-type vehicle, (Veh./h).;
V2     average speed of i-type vehicle, (km/h);
T      average time (hour);
r      distance from reference point to driving line (m);
r.    distance from forecast point to driving line (m);
a     noise attenuation factor;
AS    noise attenuation during transmission (minus);
23



It can be seen from the forecast model that, the traffic noise level during the
operation period depends on the traffic volume, vehicle composition, vehicle speed,
radiant acoustic power level of vehicle, longitudinal gradient, pavement texture, and
etc., which can be identified as follows.
(i) Traffic volume
In accordance with the feasibility study report for the road project, the traffic
forecast is summarized in Table 2-1. The co-efficient for the day time is taken as 90%.
(ii) Vehicle composition
Based on the feasibility study report, the vehicle composition of the road traffic is
as follows: small vehicle accounting for 38.6%, medium vehicle accounting for 53.2%,
and large vehicle accounting for 8.4%.
(iii) Vehicle speed
The technical standard of the road project is of Class II road, with design speed of
40km/h. It is assumed that vehicle speed of 30km/h for medium and large vehicles
and 40km/h for small vehicle in traffic noise forecast.
(iv) Traffic noise intensity Lw,i
The average traffic noise intensity for different type of vehicle can be calculated
as the following.
Large vehicle: L>v, = 77.2 + 0.18 VI;
Medium vehicle: Lwm = 62.2 + 0.32 Vm;
Small vehicle: L,, = 59.3 + 0.23 V,;
(v) Attenuation factor
Taking into consideration of the fact that most land on both sides of the road are
fannland and woodland, the attenuation factor a is taken as 0.5.
(vi) AS
AS = ALwoods + ALbuilding + ALASA
a. A", is the attenuation caused by barrier of woods, when the depth of the
woods is 30m, ALvo  = 5dB; when it is 60m, then AL,o&d = lOdB, which is the
maximum attenuation.
b. ALbuilding iS attenuation caused by barrier of building, which can be estimated as
follows:
When the first raw of building occupying 40% - 60% of the area between the
forecast point and the central line of the road, ALbuilding = 3dB; when it is 70% - 90%,
then ALbuilding = 5dB; and when every additional raw of building is added, ALbuilding iS
24



increased by 1.5dB, and the maximum is I OdB.
c. ALASA (ASA, acoustic shadow area) is the attenuation caused by acoustic
shadow area arising from high embankment or low cutting.
When the forecast point is outside the shadow area, ALASA = 0;
When the forecast point is inside the shadow area, ALASA is dependent on the
difference of sound wave path 5 = a + b + c.
Figure 4-1-1 illustrates calculation of the sound wave path.
H*s--....
R            r
where:  H   -   height of noise source, 0.8m;
M   -   height of road embankment or cutting (0.0 - 5.0m);
r   -   horizontal distance from forecast point to road shoulder;
h   -   height of the probe at forecast point, I .2m;
R   -   half of subgrade width (12.0m).
Figure 4-2-1 Illustration of calculation of sound wave path
It can be seen from the Figure that the length of the sound shadow area for
Huangzao primary school is 9.0m, and that for Xinyu primary school is 16.5m (no
shadow area for other sensitive spots); and the correspondent noise attenuation can be
find out from Fresnel curve. Based on the above mentioned model and parameters, the
traffic forecast for operation period is summarized in Table 4-2-1.

It can be seen from  Table 4-2-1 that within the assessment area the noise level in
the operation period will not exceed the standard limit as specified in the State
standard GB3096-93 (day time 70dB(A), night time 55dB(A)). By the year of 2005
the night time noise level at points 20m from road will exceed the standard limit; and
by the year of 2015, the distance of the points with exceeding noise level will be up to
30m, and the points outside the 30m distance area the noise level will not exceed the
standard limit. Therefore the impact area is relative small, only limited to the first raw
of the roadside building within the areas 30m from the road.
(2) Forecast and assessment of noise level At sensitive points
Forecast of the environmental noise level for the sensitive points can be made as
the sum of the forecast traffic noise and the background noise, as follows.
Leqfo,,ast = 10 Ig(1OlO        0uarnc + I00I'ba )
where: Leqrff,, - forecast traffic noise level at the sensitive point;
Leqback. - background noise level at the sensitive point.
Based on the above formula noise forecasts for each of the sensitive points along
the road in different operation period can be made; and the forecasts and comparisons
with the standard limits are shown in Table 4-2-2.

It can be seen from Table 4-2-2 that
(1) By the year of 2000, there will be no exceeding of the noise level over the
standard limit for all the sensitive points either by day or by night;
(2) By the year of 2005, there will be exceeding of 2.2dB(A) by night for the first
raw building beside the road at the sensitive points of Huangzao and Xinyu; exceeding
of 2.2dB(A) by day and 2.5dB(A) by night for Xinyu primary school; and exceeing of
26



2.3dB(A) by night for Huangzao primary school.
(3) By the year of 2010, there will be exceeding of different extent for all the
sensitive points except for the Xinyu hospital by night, with the maximum exceeding
of 3.7dB(A) (Xinyu and Xinyu primary school); and the maximum exceeding of
3.6dB(A) by day for the Xinyu primary school.
(4) By the year of 2015, the Xinyu primary school will have exceeding of
4.8dB(A) over the standard limit by day; and there will be some noise level exceeding
over 0.8 - 5.ldB(A) for all the sensitive poihts by night, which show that the impact
of the road traffic noise on the sensitive points is small in the initial operation period;
the impact on the Huangzao primary school and the Xinyu primary school in the mid
and long term will be increased to some extent, meanwhile, the residents close to the
road will be affected to some degree.
4.3 Forecast and assessment of ambient air quality
4.3.1 Analysis of the impact on ambient air during construction period
The impact of road construction on ambient air mainly caused by the construction
machinery, such as the lime soil mixer and the vehicles for the materials transport
usually produce suspension particle (TSP).
The TSP arising from material transport may be serious, with TSP concentration
may exceed the Class 1H standard within the areas I 5Om from the roadside.
4.3.2 Forecast and assessment of ambient air impact in operation period
(1) Forecast model
The pollutants from the road traffic during the operation period mainly are CO
and NOx, and the pollutant emission intensity may be expressed by the following
equation.
3
Qj = Ai - Eij /3600
i, I
where: Ai =  peak hour or by day hourly traffic volume of i type vehicle in
forecast year;
Eij =  individual vehicle emission factor for pollutant j from i type
vehicle, mg / veh. - m.
The emissions from the road traffic usually form a linear pollution source. In the
light of Gaussian dispersion system, the pollutant's concentration from the continuous
linear source can be calculated by the following equations, taking into account of wind
direction.
27



a. When the wind direction is perpendicular with the road
2        QL            Ht2
C (x,0,0) =       -        exp[-    -     ]
V2 7       u G,(x)       2 [a.(x)2]
where: C(x,0,0) -  relation between surface concentration and wind direction;
QL     -  intensity of the linear source, mg / m3;
x      -  distance from calculating point to road center line (m);
u      -  wind speed;
az     -  vertical dispersion parameter, m;
He    -  average effective height of the linear source, m.
b. When the wind is in parallel with the road.
QL
C (O,y,O) =
4 2 7r u ,z(y)
where: y      -  distance from calculating point to road center line (m);
C(0,y,O) - relation between surface concentration and wind direction.
c. When the angle between the wind direction and the road is of any degree
When the wind direction changes there will be monotone increase or decrease of
the effect, therefore, interpolation method can be used to get the pollutant's
concentration, when the angle between the wind direction and the road is of any
degree. 0(00<0<900)
C(0) = sin20 * Cgo9 + cos20 * Co.
where:    C  -  surface concentration in leeward direction, mg /m3;
0  -  the angle between the wind direction and the road, 0;
(2) The forecast results and assessment
Based on the above mentioned model, on the local meteorological information of
prevailing NE wind direction, with wind speed of 1.5m/s, type D stability of
meteorological condition, the forecasts of hourly and daily average concentrations of
the pollutants from the road traffic are summarized in Table 4-3-1.
It can be seen from Table 4-3-1 that in the operation period by the year of 2015,
the maximum growth of the roadside daily average and one peak hour concentration
of CO will be 0.079mg/m3 and 0.1 38mg/m3 respectively; when added with that of the
background value, the total pollutant concentration will not exceed the Class II
standard limit as specified in the State standard GB3095-1996 (4.0 and 10.0); and that
the maximum growth of the roadside daily average and one peak hour concentration
of NOx will be 0.025mg/m3 and 0.040mg/m3 respectively; when added with that of
the background value, thetotal pollutant concentration will not exceed the Class II
standard limit as specified in the State standard GB3095-1996 (0.10 and 0.15).
Therefore, the impact of road traffic in operation period on ambient air is small.

It can be seen from Table 4-3-2 with reference to the Class II standard of
GB3096-1996 that CO and NOx concentrations at the sensitive points will increase
along with the road traffic development, but still below the standard limit, which
shows that there will be more environmental capacity and that the impacts on the
ambient air quality caused by the road traffic is small.
4.4 Assessment of social environmental impact
4.4.1 Social benefit analysis
(I) The reconstruction of the road is to meet the requirement of the local
economic development for transport. Since implementation of reform and open policy,
along with the economic and social development, the transport volume in Huaan
county has been increasing rapidly, with annual growth rate of 11.6% for both
passenger and freight traffic, and the annual average growth rate of GNP high up to
20.2%, over the 8th five-year plan period. Huaan county located in the north mountain
area, the existing road transport condition is constrained by the natural and
geographical condition, characteristic of narrow pavement, abrupt turning curvature,
steep gradient, low capacity, which cannot meet the actual demand, a bottleneck for
social economic development. Improvement of the road will greatly ease the traffic
condition and to promote road transport as well as social economic development.
(2) In viewpoint of the geographical position of the road and the road network
development, Huaan is located at the border area of the western, mid and southern
Fujian province. The road from Zhangping to Huaan in the western of the province
was improved up to the Class II standard in 1996, and improvement of the road from
Tankou via Huaan to Xiaoji is being underway. Therefore it necessary and urgent to
improve the road from Tankou to Huaan Chengguan to promote the local economic
development.
(3) Improvement of Tankou-Chengguan road is necessary to integrate the local
road network. In Huaan county there are a total of 809km of roads, including the
provincial road No.306 and 6 county roads, with road density of 44.8km per square
kilometer; but most of the roads are of low standard with low capacity. Therefore
reconstruction of road from Tankou to Huaan Chengguan is part of the network
improvement, so as to bring into full play of the road network system.
(4) In viewpoint of reasonable transport route, the projected road is the southern
zorridor for Huaan county, to connect with Zhangzhou via Tankou (Tankou is 32 km
from Zhangzhou), and it is only 14km from Tankou to get on the Zhangzhou-Longyan
expressway via Shiting interchange, where it is only 20 km to reach Zhangzhou-
Zhaoan expressway. At the moment, construction of both Zhangzhou-Longyan and
Zhangzhou-Zhaoan expressway is being underway; the Zhangzhou section of
Zhangzhou-Huaan road with the subgrade up to 23m is almost completed; therefore,
reconstruction and improvement of the Huaan section from Tankou to Chengguan will
improve its link with the neighbouring cities of Zhangping, Anxi, and Yongan, as well
30



as link to the expressways to get on the national trunk road in the coast area, which
will greatly reduce the time and distance for road transport and improve transport
efficiency, which is of great significance to the local economic and social
development.
4.4.2 Analysis of the impact on local people's living standard
(1) Land acquisition and resettlement
Total land occupation of the road project is 1,104 mu, most of which are existing
road, and 167.5 mu permanent land acquisition is needed with a total relocation
2
building of 10,1 92m .
On the whole, the occupation of farmland is little and scattered over 4 towns and
villages; therefore negative impact on local people's living standard is small. It can,
however, be expected that rapid economic development followed by the improvement
of the road transport condition, hence the improvement of investment environment
and more opportunity of employment will have positive impact on the local people's
living standard.
Relocation of some of the buildings is mainly caused by widening of the road
subgrade, some of which are resident houses, and some are small shops. General
principle for relocation is to arrangement the resettlement locally with land grants
from the local government and compensations from the owner of the road, so as to
reduce the negative impact as much as possible. Although resettlement will cause
some inconvenience to the local people for the time being, eventually the local
people's living environment will be improved.
(2) The impact on local people's communication
Since the road project is to improve the existing road up to Class II standard,
there is no access control of the road; and there is no impact of partition of the local
communities. With the improvement of the road transport condition, it is more
convenient and efficient for the local people's communication.
Along the road area there are Huangzao primary school and Xinyu primary school,
which are close to the roadside. When the road traffic volume is high, the risk of road
accident will be increasing for the student. Road safety signs or signals should be set
in the junctions of the road.
4.5 Environmental impact prevention and control measures
4.5.1 Design period
(I) The greening plantation on both sides of the road should be done in
conjunction with and taking into consideration of the road subgrade protection, noise
and air pollution mitigation, as well as water and soil retention.

(6) The labour camp should be 200m away from the trunk stream of Beixi river
and the branch streams and should have septic tanks for proper treatment of the wastes
and sewage from the worksite labour camp, to dispose the wastes in designated area.
(7) Thoughtful arrangement of construction schedule should be made when there
is resident area within 150m from construction work site, e.g. no operation of
construction machine during by night (22:00 - 6:00); and when the worksite is close
to school, special time schedule should be arranged to reduce the impact;
(8) The mixers for bitumen concrete and lime soil materials shall be set up at
open place 300 meters away in the leeward of the prevailing wind direction from the
resident area. The mixers should be equipped with closed dust collection device, and
bitumen heating and mixing should be in a tightly closed device. Labour protection
measures shall be provided for operators of the machine;
(9) The materials should be covered during transportation and on the work site to
reduce spillage and dust;
(10) To sprinkle water around the construction work site to reduce dusts arising
from material transport, and to strengthen traffic safety training, education and traffic
management;
4.5.3 Operation period
(1) To set up warning sign to ban horn noise around the road areas of the
Huangzao and Xinyu primary schools, as well as speed limit sign;
(2) It is recommended that the enclose wall of the Huangzao primary school and
Xinyu primary school be heightened; and for the sections of Huangzao anf Xinyu, in
front of the resident houses close to the road a green belt of trees of 200m long and
20m wide be planted to mitigate the impact of traffic noise and the dusts.
(3) To carry out greening beautification on both sides of the road area, so as not
only to resume the cover plant damaged during the construction period, but also
improve the road landscape and the ecological environment.
(4) To strengthen management of the dangerous goods transport, with strict
enforcement of the "Regulations for Road Transport Dangerous Goods" issued by the
MOC JT3130-88, to prevent accident;
33

It can be seen from the comparisons that although the scheme I has more costs,
long term benefit will be much better due to shorter distance and better alignment with
greater social economic benefits; in contrast, although the scheme II costs less at
present, it has extreme limits for future improvement.
53 Comparison analysis of environmental factor
(1) k39 - k42 section
The merits of the scheme I are with less land acquisition and earth/stone work,
less damage to cover plants and less soil erosion by making full use of the existing
road; and the demerit is that water and soil erosion arising from construction work
would pollute the river water because it is close to the Jiulongjiang river.
The merits of the scheme II are better alignment and less impact on Jiulongjiang
river; but there will be more engineering work with more dam,age to cover plants and
soil erosion, more land acquisition, and some of the section may cause water pollution
of the Jiulongiiang river.
Based on the comparison, both of the two schemes have pros and cons in terms of
environmental protection, there is no conspicuous difference; environmental measures
need to be strengthened for both of the schemes.
(2) k52 - k55 section
The merits of the scheme I are better alignment, less earth/stone work, safer
owing to having avoided the difficult condition (traffic bottleneck) of existing bridge,
Iess risk of water pollution because of in a distance from Jiulongjiang river for most of
the section; and the demerits are more land acquisition, more damage to hilly area
cover plant and the damage arising from tunnel construction.
The merits of the scheme 11 are less environmental impact due to use of existing
road; and the demerits are more risk for traffic safety and more earth/stone work along
the river area.
37



Comparison shows that both of the scheme have the demerits of many
resettlement and close to schools without big difference, so it is agreed to recommend
the scheme I in principle, and suggest that more efforts should be made in the design
stage to mitigate environmental impact.
(3) k56 - k63 section
The merits of the scheme I are better alignment, much shorter in length, less
damage to cover plant for the tunnel , less impact on buildings on both sides of the
existing road; and the demerits are more resettlement work and more difficulties for
the tunnel construction.
The merits of the scheme II are less costs by use of the existing road, but it is of
low standard with more risk for traffic safety, and there will be great impact on
buildings on both sides of existing road when the road is straightened and widened,
with most of the section too close to the Jiulongjiang river, with more risk of water
pollution.
Based on the comparison, it is agreed to recommend the scheme I.

6.3 Cost-benefit analysis of environmental protection investment
(1) Direct benefit
The impact on ambient air quality and acoustic environment arising form road
construction and road traffic emissions is complex and has many implications for
social, economic, and ecological environment. Therefore effective environmental
protection measures may reduce or mitigate the negative impact to reduce social and
economic loss, the direct benefit from which is obvious but is difficult to be estimated
in monetary termns.
(2) Indirect benefit
The environmental protection measures taken for the road project will have the
following indirect benefits: to create good environment for schools to ensure quality
39



work of education, to create good environment for local residents beneficial to their
innovative and effective work and stability of social life, the benefit of which will be
of long term and huge and also is difficult to be estimated in monetary terms, it is,
however, an important part of the outcome of the environmental protection
investment.

8. Public Participation
Since the proposed road project will bring about great economic and social
benefit to the road area, the local people's government along the road areas and
relevant departments actively support the proposed road project.
To fully canvass the opinions of the people and departments along the road area,
and to protect the interests of the public who will be affected, investigations were
made during the preparation of the EIA report, with great assistant from relevant
department and the design unit at the end of December 1998; many departments were
visited, including the local, local people's governments at municipal and county levels,
conmnunications bureau, agricultural department, land administration commission,
water conservation department, meteorological and environmental protection bureau
etc., with opinions and comments collected from the experts and the general public.
Meanwhile the significance and the outlines of the project have been made known to
the general public. To fully understand the opinions and proposals from the general
public, sampling survey was conducted, and 50 inquiry forms were issued with 100%
of the inquiry forms completed and returned. The people inquired include workers,
farmers, civil servants, teachers and etc.. Table 8-1 shows the summary of the public
opinion, with the details as follows.
(1) Most of the people expressed their support of the proposed road project, and
recognized the great significance of the road project to the regional economic
development and the public interest, so it is the needs of the development and also the
wish of the people.
(2) The local people's governments and residents along the road area showed
their great enthusiasm and willing to contribute to the proposed road construction and
will fully support and assist the road project.
(3) Most of the people to be resettled accept the resettlement arrangement and
require that the resettlement should be done in accordance with government policy
with the compensations being made in time in lump-sum payment.
(4) The other problems talked about during the survey along the road area mainly
are as followed:
A. Any damage to the existing infrastructure facilities such as transport, road,
bridge, water irrigation, power supply and foot path or bridle way should be repaired
timely.
B. Underpasses and flyovers should be provided for the local residents
severed by the road.
C. Speed limit and warning signs for safety purpose should be set up around
the school areas (such as Huangzao primary school, Xinyu primary school, etc.) close
to the road.
44



Based on the above mentioned information, the construction unit has taken into
account of the opinions and requests and made every effort possible to accept the
suggestions.

The proposals based on the survey can be summarized as the following.
(1) Effective means should be taken to make publicity of the government policy
of economic development, resettlement and compensation for the proposed road
project along the affected road area by the road authorities in cooperation with the
local government departments and social organizations.
(2) Although the local governments have full authority to handle resettlement
work, the competent authority for this road project should also listen to the affected
residents seriously to coordinate the work in accordance with the laws and regulations,
45



to make sure the living standards not to be lowered after the resettlement and to get
more support from the public.
46



9. Conclusions
9.1 Ecological environmental impact assessment
(1) The land occupation of the road project is 1,104 mu, most of the land is from
the existing road, with newly acquired land only 167.5 mu, including 33.1mu farm
land. The impact of the land occupation can be mitigated by improvement of making
into fMll play the potentials of existing productivity and to develop the unused land.
(2) The cover plant on the road side close to the river will be damaged during the
construction period, and the cover plant over the cutting area will also disappear.
However, the measures of plantation (man made greening) will be carried out to
effectively mitigate the impact, to restore the cover plant eventually. Therefore the
impact of the road reconstruction on the cover plant will be initigated.
(3) Since un-leaded gasoline will be used, the impact of lead pollutant from the
road traffic emission on the road side soil will be little.
(4) Great amount of earth and stone work will damage the cover plant, which
makes soil erosion more serious. The estimation shows that the soil erosion during the
construction period will be 6.3 times as much as that before the construction, with
possible loss of soil up to 2,538.6 - 3,055.0 ton.
(5) The water and soil erosion in the construction period will pollute the river
water of the Jiulongjiang Beixi river and its branch streams and the pollution will
have impact on the irrigation system, to certain extent. During the period of bridge
construction, the river silts resuspension will have impact on the water quality.
Disposal of the silts by barge to designated site will mitigate the impact. Daily
discharge of sewage water from labour camp and work site will be about 15 - 45 ton,
which should be treated before being discharged. The impact of pavement run-off on
the water quality will be slight and acceptable in the road operation period.
(6) The spoils from road cutting and tunnel engineering work will be mostly used
in the road construction with relatively moderate amount for disposal, but during the
transport of the spoils there will be spillages of the spoils along the work site area to
cause impact on the environment.
9.2 Acoustic environmental impact assessment
(1) The main sources of noise during the construction period are construction
machines. The sensitive spots of resident area, Huangzao primary school, Xinyu
primary school near to the road side will have more impact. Proper arrangement of
construction work time schedule will be necessary to mitigate the impact.
(2) The day time traffic noise in the road operation period will not exceed the
Class IV standard limit specified in the State standard GB3096-93, and the distance
47



for night time noise to exceed the standard limit will be less than 30m by the year of
2015; therefore, the area affected by the noise from the road traffic is small.
(3) In the operation period, the sensitive spots of the first raw houses of the
resident areas at Huangzao and Xinyu will be affected by the night time noise from the
road traffic, with little impact by day. The teaching environment of the Huangzao
primary school and Xinyu primary school will be affected by the road traffic noise by
day; and since there is no people live in the schools overnight, the night time noise has
little impact.
(4) To mitigate the noise impact it is recommended that the enclosing wall of the
Huangzao and Xinyu primary schools be heightened up to 3m; and for the first raw
resident building close to the road side a green belt of trees be planted in front of the
buildings (200m long and 20m wide), which is good to mitigate dust impact.
(5) To take effective measures to ensure traffic safety for the Huangzao primary
school and the Xinyu primary school, such as to set up warning, no horning, speed
limit signs, and etc., at the road section around the school area.
9.3 Ambient air environmental impact assessment
(I) TSP is the main pollutant in construction period. The TSP pollutant arising
from material transport may cause serious pollution along the construction site; and
the ambient air quality in areas 1 50m from the roadside may exceed Class II standard
limit.
(2) CO and NOx concentrations, both daily average and hourly concentration,
will not exceed the Class II standard in the operation period by the year of 2015,
which indicates that the impact on ambient air quality is small.
(3) The amTbient air quality is good for the sensitive points, with CO and NOx
concentrations not exceeding the standard limits.
9.4 Social environmental impact assessment
(1) The proposed road project will produce great socio-economic benefits, by
improved transport conditions, investment environment, mountain area's development,
land use, tourist and natural resources' exploitation along the road areas.
(2) Total land acquisition shall be 167.5 mu for the road project with resettlement
buildings of 10,192m2. Reasonable compensations will be provided by the
construction unit for the resettlement in accordance with the State policy so as to
minimize the adverse impact to the minimum possible.
(3) The road project will improve the road and road transport conditions, which
will enhance the living standard for the people along the road area.
48



9.5 Overall conclusion
Based on the ecological, acoustic, air, societal environmental impact assessment
for the Huaan road section (Tankou-Chengguan) construction project, the negative
impact arising from the construction and operation of the road can be reduced to the
minimum, so long as effective measures are to be taken as recommended in this
statement, and the road project has significant economic, societal and environmental
benefit for the local people; therefore, the road project is feasible in terms of
environmental factor.
