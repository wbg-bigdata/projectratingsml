MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on India
Ninth Telecommunications Proiect (Loan 2813-IN)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the India: Ninth Telecommunications
project (Loan 2813-IN, approved in FY87) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office and the
Industry and Energy Department, with Part II prepared by the Borrower.
The project aimed at supporting: (i) the modernization and network expansion of four
metropolitan areas (Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras) and the interconnecting networks; and (ii)
limited institution-building measures in the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and in the
government-owned Delhi/Bombay telecommunication corporation (MTNL). The project achieved
its physical objectives, albeit with an eighteen-month delay caused in large part by procurement
bottlenecks; indeed, the government's decision to procure locally some major project components
led to the cancellation of more than half of the US$345 million Bank loan and its substitution by
local funds. Key institution-building components (including training, improvements in planning and
budgeting systems) were also completed under alternative funding arrangements.
Although productivity and quality of service targets were essentially achieved, the sector
remained unable to meet a growing demand, pointing to both the benefits and the limits of the
traditional public utility model (even under a corporatized framework as in MTNL's case), and the
need to consider alternative (particularly private) funding sources for future sector development.
The project outcome is rated as marginally satisfactory, its institutional development as
modest and its sustainability as likely. The PCR is thorough and informative and no audit is
planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
NINTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2813-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Ninth Telecommunications Project in India
for which a loan of US$345.0 million was approved on May 14, 1987. The amount of the loan was
revised in stages and ultimately reduced to $163.17 million. The loan was closed on December 31, 1993.
The last disbursement was made on March 18, 1994 and the undisbursed balance of $4.833 million was
canceled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division Department 11 of South
Asia Region and Telecommunications and Informatics Division of the Industry and Energy Department
of Finance and Private Sector Development. Preparation of the PCR was based inter alia on the President
and Staff Appraisal Reports, the Loan Agreement, supervision reports and correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPOR l
INDIA
NINTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2813-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Objectives:
The project was designed to address a number of broad institutional issues including
improvements in the delegation of authority, planning and budgeting, and procurement in the Department
of Telecommunications (DoT) while at the same time supporting the modernization and network
expansion of the four metropolitan telecommunication areas of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras and
the interconnecting networks. The basic objectives of the project were to:
(a)  help meet the demand for telecommunication services in the four metro districts by adding
715,0Q0 subscribers.
(b)  improve the quality of local and long distance telephone service and billing.
(c)  improve the efficiency and profitability of the network especially in high traffic density
areas.
(d)  meet training requirements in the new optical fiber and digital technologies; and
(e)  support institutional improvement efforts of DoT and its corporation, Mahanager Telephone
Nigam Limited (MTNL) which provided telecommunications services in Delhi and Bombay.
The project was an integral part of DoT's Seventh Plan for expansion of telecommunications
services throughout India. The Bank funded components included imported cables and transmission
equipment. Counterpart funding from DoT was used to procure locally produced telephone sets and some
switching equipment; the remainder of the switching equipment came from Japan using OECF funds.
2.    Implementation Experience
The procurement of underground cables and local and long distance transmission facilities
suffered delays of up to one and one-half years behind the original schedule. These delays were mainly
due to the lengthy procedures which were not conducive to quick decision making. The need for DoT
to obtain approval from the Department of Electronics as well as other inter-governmental clearances
before award of contract contributed significantly to the delays. The decision to maximize indigenous
procurement as a result of the policy of the new Telecom Commission (est. 1989), resulted in cancellation
of parts of the loan in various stages of procurement, eliminating the domestic satellite earth station
equipment, the Automatic Message accounting system and ultimately the packet switching equipment.



iii
This resulted in the cancellation of $177 million in the original loan amount of $345 million. The
implementation of some of these components was delayed by this cancellation, and some had not been
completed by project closing. It is expected however, that all components will be completed within two
years as DoT/MTNL has arranged financing in each case.
On the institutional side, the training and manpower development program was implemented with
little use of loan funds mainly with the assistance of UNDP/ITU. DoT itself introduced arrangements
for increasing delegation of authority to its field units, and managed the development of its own system
for streamlining it planning and budget process.
3.    Results
The project achieved its major objectives although its financing from the Bank loan was
substantially reduced. The financial and economic rate of return on the project is estimated in excess of
23%. The number of additional subscribers connected between 1987 and 1992 was 675,000 in the four
metro districts, close to the target of 715,000. During the same period, DoT exceeded its target for
connection of nationwide lines. Despite this good result, the total expressed unsatisfied demand for
telephone service nationwide increased by 100% to 2.3 million lines, indicating the need to further
accelerate supply to meet demand. The quality of service overall improved between 1987 to 1992 with
respect to all the relevant performance indicators although it remains not very acceptable by international
standards. Complaints decreased from about 37 to 25 per month for 100 subscribers; failure of local calls
decreased from 37 to 25% and long distance calls from 49 to 28%. Bill collection rates remained very
good but newspaper reports suggest that a serious problem remains with respect to the accuracy of
DoT/MTNL's bills. The revenue per direct exchange lines has shown considerable increase from about
IRs 3893 (US $130) in 1987 to IRs 5431 (US$180) in 1992. The productivity as measured by the
number of staff improved from 100 to 64 per 1000 lines between 1987 and 1992. Progress was also
achieved in institutional improvements in the delegation of authority to the DoT's regions and with their
planning and budgeting processes. With regards to procurement, DoT did not meet the Bank's minimum
standards on timeliness and, as a result of this and a change in funding of some project items at loan
closing, some of the key project components were still in the process of being completed---e.g. packet
switching, modernization of earth stations, and network management.
4.    Sustainabilitv
The sustainability of the project is assured. DoT/MTNL have a stable technical and commercial
base and are expected to perform well financially as in the past given their monopoly status. Even if DoT
is subjected to competition, there position of pre-eminence is likely to remain and the project would
therefore be sustained. Under a competitive scenario, DoT/MTNL are likely to continue as the main
operator for a long time because of their huge operational base, the overwhelming demand for services,
and the Governmnent's stated position that it would protect the jobs of existing DoT staff. Tariffs under
a competitive environment are likely to remain at or around the existing level and network usage levels
are likely to increase thereby improving the returns on the project investments.
5.     Findings and Lessons
The project was successful in that most of the objectives were met. However, there were two
major problems during implementation of the loan: the long procurement delays and the cancellation of



iv
a large portion of the loan which delayed project implementation. The procurement delays and the
cancellations suggest that DoT could have given much greater and much more appropriate priority to the
project and to servicing the needs of its customers. Also, while institutional improvements were made,
these too were delayed. It is difficult to assess the effect of the loan on institutional development issues.
As planned, DoT increased the delegation of responsibility to field units and developed an important new
planning and budgeting system; but neither of these jobs were completed using loan funds as intended.
Also, DoT took a long time to begin implementing these arrangements which had been agreed during
project appraisal.
The first lesson to be drawn is that where past experience suggests the likelihood of
implementation delays on procurement and consultancies, then contracting arrangements need to be much
further advanced in the project cycle than they were in this case. At the time of this project, advancing
procurement to the stage of the Bank's no objection to contract awards as a condition of Board
presentation, was quite innovative. However, it was not good enough and long delays continued until
the awards were actually made. To reduce the remaining delay, it may be necessary to have the supply
and consultant contracts signed prior to Board presentation; such contracts to become effective on the
Bank's approval and effectiveness of the loan. Arrangements of this nature should be relatively easily
accommodated in the case where the Bank has an ongoing presence in the sector from  previous
investment projects.
The second lesson is that institutional development of large monopoly organizations is inherently
very difficult. A monopoly position removes or limits any externalities which would otherwise induce
change. Once the Bank's loan is awarded, there is little incentive for the monopoly organization to carry
out institutional development actions which it is not committed to. This is made more difficult if precise
mechanisms for carrying out those actions are not agreed to prior to Board approval (as in this case).
There are at least three approaches which could be taken to overcome this problem: (a) advance the hiring
of consultants by finalizing the terms of reference and selecting the consultants prior to Board
presentation. Alternatively, (b) address the sector structure issues.   The modern approach for
telecommunications is to privatize and or introduce competition into the sector. Even if competition is
not feasible, breaking up large monopolies can bring significant improvements through benchmark
competition and increased executive accountability for performance. Or (c), if experience shows that
major structural reforms are needed but the government is not prepared to take appropriate actions, as
a last resort the Bank should consider withdrawing its support for investment lending in the sector, or
limit lending with a much greater focus on institutional development.
In the case of this loan, the government had begun sector reform by corporatizing part of the
DOT structure through the creation of the MTNL (for providing services in Delhi and Bombay), and the
VSNL for providing international services. During the project the Bank concluded that further project
lending to DoT would not bring about the major institutional improvements needed. It therefore decided
that no further loans to the sector should be given without major structural change first being
implemented'.
Subsequent to the project, the Bank has provided support to the Governnent of India on overall sector reform through a Japanese
Grant for telecommunications technical assistance. Under the project, Indian consultants have developed guidelines for creation of
a regulator and conditions of entry for private operators. On May 13, 1994 the government of India announced a National Telecom
Policy 1994 which breaks the monopoly of the DoT by permitting private operators to assist DoT in providing value added and basic
service.

2.    Background
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) within the Ministry of Communications (MOC)
provides public telecommunications services in India and with neighboring countries. In an important
institutional reform, DoT was separated from the Department of Posts in January 1985. The Mahanagar
Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) under MOC, a public corporation established April 1, 1986, operates
the Bombay and Delhi networks. The Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSN--overseas communications service)
was also established April 1, 1986 as a public corporation under MOC to operate telecommunications
services with the rest of the world. At that time, telecommunications equipment was mostly manufactured
locally by three public sector enterprises (PSEs): (a) Indian Telephone Industries Ltd. (ITI) under MOC;
(b) Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL), under MOC; and (c) Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL), under the
Ministry of Industry. A vast array of private and joint venture public/private companies are now
involved in the local manufacture of virtually all telecommunications equipment including exchanges,
transmission systems and subscriber equipment and cables.
Prior to this project, the Bank Group had made eight loans and credits (totalling $800 million)
for telecommunications since 1962.  These provided most of the foreign exchange for India's
telecommunications development. During this period, the number of working telephone lines increased
from 373,000 in 1962 to more than 5.8 million by 1992, the trunk network was expanded and
modernized, and an automatic telex network of about 48,600 subscribers established. The Bank Group
also assisted DoT to modernize its organization and management structure, including establishing an
Economics Cell for analyzing pricing, demand, and investment issues in the sector.   The main
implementing agency has been the Telecommunications Branch of the Posts and Telegraph Department
(now DoT); however, in the Seventh and Eighth Projects (Loan 1592-IN and Credit 1112-IN), the Bank
also financed investment in ITI, HCL and HTL. Project performance audits have been conducted on the
first six projects. These audits have found the projects to be generally successful in terms of expansion
and financial performance. The Seventh and Eighth projects, which were closed in December 1984 and
December 1985 respectively, had a largely similar impact. However, like their predecessors, both
projects suffered lengthy procurement delays and had little institutional development impact.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1 Project Objectives
The basic project objectives were to:
(a) help meet the demand for telecommunications services in the four metro districts, by
connecting an additional 715,000 subscribers;



2
(b) improve the quality of telephone service and billing in the metro districts, through the
introduction of modem technology, network rehabilitation, and replacement of
substandard equipment;
(c) provide good quality subscriber trunk dialing (STD) service between the metro
districts, and to other major cities;
(d) improve the efficiency and profitability of the network, especially in areas with high
traffic density;
(e) meet the training requirements in the new digital and optical fiber technologies; and
(f) support DoT/MTNL's institutional improvement efforts.
The project also had a general objective to increase the effectiveness of domestic procurement
through the expanded use of competitive bidding for domestic procurement and the introduction of
commercial contracts for sole source procurement between DoT and government manufacturers.
3.2 Proiect Description
The project included all the investments in the four metro cities during the Seventh Plan,
plus the new long distance links between them, a long distance network management system, a
training component and consultancy services. The main project components were:
Part A.  Installation of local and long distance transmission facilities (including optical fiber and
digital microwave systems), within and between the four metropolitan networks of
Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras, together with local and long distance telephone
and telex switching facilities and buildings, to increase the telephone exchange capacity
in the four metropolitan areas by about 1,000,000 local lines and 50,000 long distance
trunks, and the telex exchange capacity by about 14,000 local lines. Most of the
transmission and equipment and some of the cables to be imported were to be financed
from the proposed Bank loan. With the exception of 195,000 lines to be imported
from Japan, the telephone switching equipment was to be manufactured in India.
Part B.  (i)  Modernization and expansion of domestic satellite earth station networks;
(ii)  Establishment of a packet switched data network between the four metropolitan
cities and other major cities and industrial areas;
(iii) Establishment of a long distance network management system, including
appropriate facilities to improve traffic flows by locating and bypassing or
eliminating bottlenecks; and
(iv) Introduction of automatic message accounting facilities in the four metropolitan
networks, to permit detailed billing of STD calls.
Part C.  Support, to the UNDP funded training program  for upgrading five regional
telecommunications training centers and manpower development, including 99 staff-
months of ITU experts, 125 fellowships, and training and laboratory equipment.

Part D.  Provision of consultants' services for institutional improvements in DoT and for design
of B (iii) above.
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
The project was designed to help implement that part of the Seventh Plan (1985-90) which
focused on high priority telecommunications investments in the key metropolitan networks of Bombay,
Delhi, Calcutta and Madras and the long distance backbone transmission routes between them. The
rational was to support the use of modern digital and optical fibre technologies which required foreign
exchange resources for the direct import of equipment not manufactured in India. The project was also
designed to support the components generating the network's greatest profits, thus easing the sector's
overall constraints in the medium and long term and also providing relief to the areas with the longest
waiting time for new connections. The project size was contained within DoT's capacity to grow and
to match the availability of local counterpart funds. The other part of the project was designed to bring
institutional improvements to increase operations efficiency, reduce staffing ratios, streamline project
sanctioning procedures, and retrain staff displaced by new technology. However, this part of the project
was not adequately developed and there were no terms of reference prepared and agreed with the DoT
on what to address and how to proceed. The investment part of the project was organized to overcome
the long procurement delays experienced by earlier projects by requiring Bank clearance of contract
award on at least 40 % by value of procurement items. Overall the project design was very good and took
into account previous lending experience.
5.    Proiect Implementation
5.1 Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-Up:
The loan was approved on June 29, 1987 with a target effectiveness date of September 28,
1987. The loan became effective on that date when the Subsidiary Loan Agreement was executed
by GOI and MTNL, which was a condition of effectiveness.
5.2 Implementation Experience:
The project was originally scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1991. However,
the loan closing date was extended from December 31, 1992 to December 31, 1993 to allow time
for project completion. Part A components for basic infrastructure had been procured and about
95 % installed by March 1992. Targets for connection of telephone lines in Delhi, Bombay and
Madras were met by March 1991, whereas targets for Calcutta were not met until March 1993.
Overall, the main part of the project was about 1 'h years late, although some items remained
uncompleted at loan closing. These were the Part B items of packet switching, network
management, modernization of earth stations, and automatic message accounting (see Table 2,
Section 6). The main reason for the project delay was the time taken to complete procurement.
The implementation schedule provided for procurement action on the major components for the
metropolitan networks and long distance systems to be completed by the first quarter of 1987.
However, DoT was only able to complete procurement action by mid-1988.
The project underwent a major change in 1989 with the creation of the new Telecom
Commission. The Commission established a policy of maximizing indigenous procurement and
as a result decided not to proceed with the use of Bank funds to buy the remaining Part B items.
The Commission instead sought Bank agreement to use the funds to buy components for local

The Commission instead sought Bank agreement to use the funds to buy components for local
manufacturers. When the Bank was unable to accede to this request, GOI agreed to cancel $135
million of the loan reducing it to $193 million (See Table 6C, Part III). Once the procurement
action was completed, equipment implementation was completed quickly and without major
problems.
S.3 Procurement:
Special action was taken in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the poor procurement
performance in the seventh and eighth projects. The main requirement was for DoT to issue bid
invitations and present evaluation reports to the Bank for eight major items before Board
presentation in May 1987. These items had a value of about 56% of the loan amount. Except
for an item of relatively small value, this requirement was met. However, inordinate delays began
thereafter. By early 1988, about a year after the Bank's clearance, DoT had placed orders for
only three out of the eight items amounting to a value of about $66.5 million, or about 20% of
the loan amount. On average, DoT took about 10 to 13 months from Bank clearance of the bid
evaluation to placement of purchase orders. A large part of the delay was due to lengthy inter-
Government clearances. Delays also occurred in the clearance of the DoT's evaluation reports
by the Bank. These were mainly due to numerous clarifications required by the Bank on the
content of the evaluation reports.
The Bank supervision missions repeatedly discussed the procurement delays and sought
remedies. The serious nature of the problem resulted in a DoT delegation visiting the Bank in
October 1988. A bidding irregularity involving changes in bid prices on cables, which was
discovered by DoT, exacerbated the problem. The funds associated with this incident were
eventually cancelled on the basis of misprocurement. In March, 1989, the Bank again expressed
its concern regarding the protracted and apparent unnecessary delays with procurement. The
main concerns at that time were the extensive delays in contracting for underground cable; and
the lack of a bid evaluation for the packet switching a year after bid opening. The Bank sought
from DoT an undertaking to carry out an urgent and comprehensive review of its procurement
procedures. Following that review, DoT did take some actions to streamline its procurement
decisions, although the new procedures had little effect on speeding up procurement of the
remaining items.
The effect of the Telecom Commission's decision to cancel most of the remaining
procurement is shown in Table 6C at Part III of the report. Although it was decided by the
Telecom Commission not to proceed with procurement of the Packet Switching Data Systems but
to design and produce an indigenous system, the decision was later reversed. The Bank agreed
to the issue of a new bid document in early 1992, but its issue was so delayed that procurement
and installation of the item could not be completed within the two year extension of the loan
closing date. The Bank informed DoT it could not fund the item because of the delay and DoT
agreed to procure this equipment using its own funds. At project close, India remained one of
the few countries without a comprehensive packet switch network which is so critical for business
services. Procurement of the final items of test equipment for optical fibre and transmission
systems were finally completed by December 1993.

5.4 Proiect Costs:
The project's estimated cost at appraisal was $2,050 million with a foreign cost of $418
million. Table 5A in Part IlI gives an estimate of the cost of the project on completion assuming
the remaining items will be completed as planned. The estimated actual cost of the project was
$1,655 million with a direct foreign cost of $224 million. There was saving of about 20% on
total project cost with a saving in local cost of about 13% and direct foreign cost of about 47%.
The lower costs were attributed to a general fall in telecommunications prices during the project
period. Contingency allowances were not used. The savings in direct foreign cost was due to
the substantial reduction in foreign procurement and funding which resulted in cancellation of
about $135 million (see para 5.3).

for the period. DoT did meet its major national objectives for the seventh plan period of which
the project formed a part. As expected however, national expressed unsatisfied demand grew
during the project period from 1.1 million to 2.3 million lines. Estimates at 1994 place the actual
unsatisfied demand for telephone service somewhere between 20 and 40 million lines in 1994.
Quality of telephone calls improved substantial during the project as a result of using more
reliable digital exchanges and the digital transmission systems provided under the project.
There was mixed success with the other physical network components (Part B items). Small
earth stations were provided using DoT's own funding, and there was a conflict in funding over
the upgrading of earth stations which was eventually resolved by having the item funded by
OECF. Considerable supervision effort was spent with DoT on preparing terms of reference for
the network management system; these had not been prepared during appraisal. Although the
TOR were eventually finalized, DoT then chose to use Australian consultants funding by AIDAB.
The network management work was not completed by loan closing. Finally, the Automatic
Message Accounting systems, which were to provide improved customer billing, were only
partially provided--DoT chose instead a policy of replacement of obsolete exchanges. The
history of packet switching was described in the procurement section above. Table 6B of Part
III gives the actual performance of key indicators against targets set at the beginning of the
project.
6.2 Physical Results:
The major physical components of the project have been completed and commissioned. The
most important long distance links of 140 MB/s microwave digital systems between Bombay/
Madras/Calcutta/Sambalpur and DhulialNagpur and the new optical fiber systems 140 MB/s were
completed between Delhi/Bombay and Delhi/Agra. In addition, the local systems in the metro
area were strengthened by the installation of optical fiber and 1722 PCM systems. A description
of the physical results of the project is given in Table 6A of Part III.
6.3 Technical Assistance:
The project proposed hiring consultants to help with institutional development and planning
and budgeting and network management. DoT hired local consultants for some planning and
budgeting, but are now hiring network mnanagement consultants using bilateral funds. The training
development program included assistance from UNDP/ITU. The contracts for the digital
microwave and optical fiber systems provided for technical assistance in training.
6.4 Financial Performance:
The consolidated DoT/MTNL financial performance significantly exceeded projections (See
Table 6D of Section HI). As an example, for 1989/90, operating revenues were 33% above
appraisal projections (IRs35.3 billion compared to IRs26.5 billion), whereas operating expenses
were only 11% above projections (IRs 19.0 billion compared with IRs17. 1 billion). Net income
after tax was IRs 13.3 billion, more than 100% greater than projected. DoT/ MTNL met all of
its financial covenants. The main reason for the good financial performance was a significant
increase in tariffs which raised the revenue per line from about $130 in 1987 to $180 equivalent



8
in 1992. As an example', between 1986 and 1990, installation fees increased by 166%, bi-
monthly rents increased between 30% and 60%, and manual call charges were significantly
increased.
6.5 Economic Analysis
The SAR calculated the internal rate of return on the entire DoT/MTNL investment program
during FY86-90. This was done because the Bank financed project was an integral component
of the Seventh plan and any separation would have been arbitrary and difficult to determine. A
similar approach was taken in calculating the actual rate of return. The benefit period was the
same, although some investment carry over was estimated for FY 1991 to account for the delay
of the project.
The financial IRR was calculated to be 23%, well above the 15% estimate in the SAR (see
Table 6E of Section III). The increase is commensurate with the higher rate of return on assets
than expected which in turn reflects higher tariffs and lower investment costs than originally
projected. The calculated value is likely to be conservative as there is no allowance for future
increases in tariffs or calls per line which could be expected. The economic rate of return
(estimated at 20% in the SAR) would be expected to be higher than the 23% FIRR after taking
into account consumer surplus and other unquantifiable benefits that come with improved access
to telecommunication facilities.
6.6 Institutional Impact
DoT has achieved satisfactory results in the project's institutional action plan except in the
procurement area. From 1985 to 1992 the staffing ratio was reduced from 100 staff to about 64
staff per 1000 lines. The overall maintenance of equipment improved as demonstrated by the
decrease in faults from an average of about 33 to about 20 per 100 subscribers/month. The
effects of greater "delegation of authority" and the new strategic "Planning and Budgeting"
system, which were part of the project, are difficult to quantify, but will have a positive effect
in preparing DOT for corporatization. The quality of billing is difficult to measure, but
newspaper reports suggest that many billing errors continue to occur.
7.     Project Sustainability
The sustainability of the operations and benefits of the project are expected to be excellent. The
project is a part of DoT and MTNL's expansion program and forms a core component of their raison
d'etre. DoT/MTNL have a stable technical and commercial base and are expected to perform well
financially as in the past given their monopoly status. Even if DoT is subjected to competition, their
position of pre-eminence is likely to remain and the project would therefore be sustained. Under a
competitive scenario, DoT/MTNL are likely to continue as the main operator for a long time because of
their huge operational base, the overwhelming demand for services, and the Government's stated position
that it would protect the jobs of existing DoT staff. Tariffs under a competitive environment are likely
to remain at or around the existing level and usage levels are likely to increase thereby improving the
returns on the project investments.
I   The India tariff structure is complex, therefore sample rate increases only can be given.

8.     Bank Performance
The Bank, in implementation of the project, devoted considerable effort to get the procurement
process on track with limited success. After being successful in getting the bid preparation for the major
items, the Bank assisted in the resolution of the issues that came up in the evaluation and in the eventual
placing of contracts. The Bank had little option but to accept the Borrower's stand to go for indigenous
procurement and accept cancellation of a large piece of the loan. In the case of the packet switching
network, when the Borrower reversed its decision to develop and buy indigenously, the Bank agreed to
fund ICB procurement of the item. However, after further delays in issuing the bid, DoT agreed to fund
the item from its own resources. The Bank also maintained a continuous dialogue with the Borrower and
its agencies on the restructuring of the sector and carried out a sector study and workshops to discuss the
principal issues and options for the development of the sector. The Bank's supervision was adequate and
its overall performance in this project was satisfactory.
9.     Borrower/Implementer's Performance
Except for the procurement delays, and component cancellations, the Borrower's performance
has also been satisfactory. The DoT was helpful and constructive in the preparation of the bid
documents, showed a commitment to installing and commissioning equipment quickly, and displayed an
interest in discussing with the Bank institutional development, finance, and sector reform issues.
However, DoT was unable to accelerate its own procurement processes or influence governrnent to speed
up intra-governmental clearances. On the institutional side, the Borrower showed a commitment for
improvement and supported measures for improved delegation of authority and planning and budgeting.
However, DoT was reluctant to hire experts to help introduce improvements quickly. The performance
of MTNL which was created as a pilot for the introduction of more commercially oriented management
proved quite successful (Attachment 3).
10.   Proiect Relationship
The project relationship between the Bank and Borrower and its agencies the DoT, MTNL has
been quite good. The cooperation extended to Bank missions and the response to concerns expressed by
the Bank in correspondence and personal meetings relating to the project and in general, have been very
satisfactory to both parties.
11.   Consulting Services
DoT performed most of the work in improving delegation of authority and developing its
improved planning and budgeting systems without the use of consultants. DoT was reluctant to use Bank
funds to hire international consultants and funded local consultants where necessary.
12.   Proiect Documentation and Data
The Loan Agreement in the case of Loan 2813-IN was quite adequate for monitoring and
achieving project objectives in the key investment organizational and funancial areas. The appraisal report
of the project provided a useful framework for both Bank and DoT/MTNL for review of project
implementation. DoT submitted quarterly progress reports on progress of the reports and special reports
when required.

PART 11 - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    World Bank loan for the IXth Telecommunications Project 2813-IND for an amount of 345
million US Dollars was sanctioned in September 1987. In November 1989 the loan amount was reviewed
and reduced to 184.5 million US$. A further reduction of 16.5 million US$ was made in 1992 on
PSPDN and cables. Loan closing date is 31-12-1993. The main components under the loan are:
(a)  140 Mbit digital microwave system between Bombay-Madras-Calcutta-Sambalpur and
Dhulia-Nagpur.
(b)  140 MBIT OFC system between Delhi-Madras, Trichur-Trivandrum and Delhi-Agra.
(c)  140 Mbit OFC system and 34 MBIT 13 GHZ microwave systems for junction networking
at Madras, Bombay Delhi and Calcutta.
2.    In addition to the above, more than 1700 PCM systems, some digital co-axial systems and cables
and measuring instruments also formed part of the loan.
3.    Bombay-Madras, 140 Mbit digital microwave and Trichur-Trivandrum 140 Mbit OFC were
commissioned in March 1990. Most of the other systems were commissioned during the period
December 1990 to March 1992. It is to be noted that along with commissioning of these systems these
stations were provided with ElOB digital exchanges and/or TAXs. During the project period, the number
of DELs in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras increased by 12.34% from 16.53 lakhs to 18.59 lakhs.
Furthermore, as a result of the proper provision of local and long distance facilities the call success rate
of both local and STD in Metro Districts as well as on all India basis have shown substantial improvement
and the per direct exchange line revenue has increased in all the centers covered by the above system.
These systems were very much an integral part of the overall development plans of the VIlth Five Year
Plan of DoT.
4.      A part of the loan was canceled due to: (i) policy changes in relation to procurement during
the period; (ii) indigenous manufacture; (iii) reduction in prices of certain items; and (iv) some
procurement problems. Despite the best efforts of DoT, some problems were encountered in the speedy
procurement. The installation and commissioning of the procured equipment, however, was completed
very quickly.

Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. (MTNL)
MTNL was formed on April 1, 1986 to take over from DoT the management, control and operation
for the telecommunications networks of Delhi and Bombay. During its seven years of operations by 1992-93,
MTNL has achieved very substantial results. Both the system capacity and the Direct Exchange lines have more
than doubled so that by 1992-93 the capacity was 1.77 million and DELS 1.59 million lines averaging a growth
of about 11.5% during the seven year period. The quality of service has also improved. A large number of
STD and local pay phones as well as Telecom centers have been opened for accessibility to the public.
Substantial improvements have also been made in the incidence of faults, call completion rates and manual trunk
operations. MTNL has also introduced special meetings called "ADALATS" to provide a forum for customers
grievances and redressal.
The financial performance of MTNL has been very good. For investment it was able to float
customer bonds and since 1991-92 has also disinvested part of its equity with the result that 20% of its equity
capital stands disinvested. MTNL has also made significant financial contribution to DoT.
MTNL has prepared plans for expansion and improvement in the quality of service in the next four
years for doubling the capacity and providing high quality enhanced services.
