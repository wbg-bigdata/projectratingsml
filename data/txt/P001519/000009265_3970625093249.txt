Telecommunications Study - Draft Terms of
Reference
1.        RNCFM, headquartered in Antananarivo, presently communicates with
the stations on its branch line between Horamanga and Lac Alaotra, for
train control and other information, by underground cable between
Antananarivo and Moramanga and by open wire land line between Moramanga and
Lac Alaotra. Phone drops are located at each station. The comunmication
system on the branch line is old, spare parts are no longer available and
maintenance costs are high because of theft of the wire and vegetation
growth.
2.        The consultant will be required to review on site the uses and
requirements for telecommunications on the branch line taking into account
the existing system between Antananarivo and Moramanga and recommend a cost
effective method of satisfying the requirements. A two-way radio system
would be explicitly included among the alternatives to be studied. More
specifically, the consultant will develop detailed procurement and
installation specifications and provice a realistic estimate of costs
taking into account local conditions.
3.        The consultant will also be required to ensure that: (1) The
procurement list includes sufficient spares to satisfy maintenance
requirements for two years; (2) supply an estimate of the annual
consumption of spare parts for maintenance purposes; (3) to provide a list
of shop equipment necessary to long term maintenance of the system; and (4)
to recommend staff levels and local training requirements sufficient to
ensure that staff has expertise to reliably operate the new
telecommunications system.
4.        After bids for the new system have been submitted by the
telecommunication contractor, copies will be forwarded to the home office
of the consultant that designed the procurement request for evaluation.
The evaluation is to be completed in a timely fashion and forwarded to
RNCFM for further action.

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Training
1.        Despite limited financial resources, RNCFM has always paid
special attention to the training of its personnel. In 1963-73 the
emphasis was placed on Cours Superieurs Professionnels du 2e degre - CSP2
(Second Level Advanced Vocational Training Courses), designed to train
senior supervisory staff, and on evening training courses for the operating
personnel. Since 1974 the training has developed and has included:
(i) special short-term refresher and advanced training courses for
professionals, (ii) regular, CSP2 courses and (iii) apprenticeships for the
training of skilled workers.
2.        The CSP2 training courses at railway headquarters in Antananarivo
are given in liaison with two African regional training centers: one in
Douala and the other in Abidjan. This interregional collaboration has been
operating continuously and coherently thanks to technical assistance by the
French National Railway Company (SNCF), organized through the French
National Office of Assistance for Railways and Equipment (OFERMAT).
3.        The three centers (Antananarivo, Douala, Abidjan) use more or
less the same training program, with the exception of certain technology
courses which vary depending on the needs of the individual system. Annual
meetings attended by training representatives of the French-speaking
African railway systems put forward proposals for the organization,
revision and evaluation of training programs. It is interesting to note
that staff of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway took the CSP2 training in
Antananarivo from 1967 to 1976. Recent contacts have given rise to the
hope that a resumption of this cooperation will be possible.
4.        The CSP2 courses are offered to the top under-30 years of age
railway employees in the technical departments, providing they have at
least two years' experience in their field of specialization. After
training they have an opportunity to fill high level supervisory jobs such
as: chief foreman (shop foreman) for the Mechanical and Electrical
Engineer's Department, district inspector and chief draftsman for the
Permanent Way, Structures and Equipment Department and Chief Stationmaster
for the Traffic Operations Department.
5.        The proper training lasts three years, during which time the
trainees are assigned to the Training Center. An additional year is spent
preparing for the qualifying admission examination. The preparatory year
will be eliminated in 1985-86 because the overall educational level of the
trainees is increasingly higher due to the progress being made in national
education and because classroom space at the Training Center is limited.

ANNEX 2.2
Page 2 of 7
6.        Training of skilled workers is done through an apprenticeship
program that recruits young holders of the CEPE (Certificate of
Primary/Elementary Training) on the basis of a competitive examination.
The training program was begun in 1983 and consists of three years
training. Graduates of the program are then qualified to work in the
Mechnical and Electrical Engineer's Department.
Training results (1983-84)
7.        Training results in the most recent fiscal year (1983-84), were
as follows: (i) CSP2: 27 employees were trained, including 14 in the
preparatory year, (ii) apprenticeship:  12 apprentices in their first year,
(iii) correspondence courses: 508 enrolled in 49 general education
subjects, accounting and secretarial training, (iv) introductory courses:
organized for 80 university-level and 13 professional-level and 6
supervisory-level employees undergoing training provided by an OFERNAT
expert; 39 professionals in data processing, 11 driving instructors, 12
employees in supplies, 4 district inspectors; preliminary training:  50
trainee drivers and 20 section foreman.
Evaluation of the training
8.        RNCFM's training center lacks physical and technical resources.
The center has four classrooms which hold 70, 80, 25 and 25 students
respectively. These room serve the CSP2, the apprenticeship and the
refresher training. One of the rooms also doubles as a library. Teaching
materials are virtually non-existent and the apprenticeship workshop does
not have enough of the tools or measuring instruments that are essential
for practical work. The audio-visual equipment consists of one projector.
The copying equipment needed for the correspondence course is poor. The
library consists of 200 books, none of which is more recent than 1970.
9.        Only 30Z of the training needs, as identified by the technical
departments in their annual program, have been met. It has not been
possible to recruit more than about 12 apprentices per year because of the
extremely limited training facilities. Several refresher courses for
managerial supervisory staff have not materialized for lack of appropriate
premises and equipment.



ANNEX 2.2
Page 3 of 7
10.       Yet human resources have made the training worthwhile.
According to the OFERMAT training specialist in charge of evaluating the
CSP2 courses, the training provided by the RNCFM training center is of a
high standard because the teaching is excellent. The trainers,
particularly those specializing in technical subjects, have had extensive
professional experience (10 years service on average) and have excellent
basic knowledge. RNCFM's policy of encouraging professional and skilled
supervisory staff to take part in the training also enhances the level of
teaching. Perhaps most important, RNCFM's management pays trainers at
attractive rates: FMG 1,000/hour for RNCFM trainers and FMG 1,030/hour for
outside trainers. Teacher training seminars given by an OFERMAT specialist
are also available to professional and supervisory staff to introduce them
to the basic rudiments of teaching and communication skills. In sum, RNCFM
management has aimed to make the most of the resources available in order
to keep the training up to a satisfactory level.
Average training costs
11.        The Training Center's 1984 operating costs were FMG 21,798,151,
broken downz as fellows: (i) cost of teaching staff: FMG 5,980,700, (ii)
cost of raw materials: FMG 4,374,347, (iii) cost of administrative
personnel: FMG 11,443,104. Hourly training cost per professional employee
was therefore FMG 7,300; FMG 5,100 per supervisory employee; FMG 3,300 per
CSP2 student; and FMG 4,115 per apprentice. The average cost of training
seems high because of the extremely small number of students per section
(e.g. in 1983-84 there were five first-year and four second-year students
in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering CSP 2 section).
Training Management
12.        Until September 30, 1984 the organization of training activities
was handled by a Division. On that date the Board of Directors upgraded
the divi;ion to the rank of Department, following the suggestion of the
General Manager.   The Department, now known as the Training Center, is
divided (not counting the Applied Psychology section) into two parts:the
General Technical Training Division and the Specialized Technical Training
Division. The Training Center now reports directly to Management; and
bears the same title and rank as the main technical departments. The head
of training is thus automatically a member of the Council of Department
Heads, a group that helps formulate RNCFM's general development policy and
makes important managerial decisions. Management also decided to
strengthen the link between training and the user departments by assigning
to the training department three experienced operating specialists in
permanent way and structures, in motive power and in traffic. These
specialists will orgainize specific training, identify training needs,
monitor practical training being offered in workshops and discuss with
production chiefs how to tailor training more effectively to RNCFM's real
needs.

Human Resources Division
13.        In October 1984,  RNCFM's Board of Directors created a Human
Resources Division, provisionally attached to the General Affairs
Department. This new division is responsible for personnel planning and,
working closely with the Training Center, for matching job requirements and
job skills among the staff. Still at the embryonic stage in early 1985,the
human resources division lacks appropriate specialists, needs to be
strengthened and ultimately attached to the Training Center. Despite its
shortcomings, creation of the Human Resource Division indicates
Management's effort to set up a mechanism that can eventually establish
long-term personnel planning forecasts. The Division's needs should be
given some technical and material support to become operational during the
Third Railway Project (paragraph 19).
Training Program for 1985-90
14.       The original training program proposed by RNCFM for 1985-90 was
prepared using methodology recommended by an OFERMAT specialist. The
result was an ambitious plan involving 4,314 (or nearly all the railway's
employees and totalling 13,000 man/months (m/m) of training.
Implementation would have required construction of five new schools: one
for the CSP2 courses, one as an apprenticeship center, and three practical
schools (fixed installations, motive power, traffic operation). The
program also contained a proposal to construct a building to house a
library, an applied psychology unit and a language laboratory.
Construction costs were estimated at US$2.1 million, not counting
furniture, equipment, technical assistance and fellowships for
professionals to receive training abroad. RNCFM's contribution, which was
to cover salaries and the training materials, was estimated at FMG 202
million.
15.       In the course of the project appraisal, those in charge of
training came to the realization that the proposed program was
over-ambitious and did not make provision for the time needed both to
prepare architectural plans and to complete construction. A replacement
program has been prepared (details attached).
Strategy adopted for preparation of second training program
16.       The revised program calls for continued emphasis on the training
of Senior supervisory personnel. During the period under review, priority
will be placed on consolidating and developing the CSP2 courses.
Construction of three practical schools (permanent way/structures, motive
power, traffic operations) will not be undertaken, however, because there
was still insufficient data to justify the investments.
17.       Training of professional staff will also continue, but will take
place abroad, for the most part, with the help of OFERMAT or some other
organization specializing in railways. Meanwhile, the use of other local
centers will be investigated.



ANNEX 2.2
Page 5 of 7
18.       The apprenticeship training is to be strengthened but no new
facility will be built. Equipment and tools to help improve the quality of
the training will be purchased and the existing workshop may be
rehabilitated. Before funds are spent unnecessarily, however, RNCFM will
study whether this training could take place at other State-run vocational
training establishments. The goal is to ensure that the RNCFM center
provide training for workers in fields of specialization for which training
does not exist elsehwere, or for which the output rate of the national
education system is still too limited to meet labor market needs.
19.       To be effective, the program should meet needs of individual
employees, as determined by the requirements of his/her job and skills. A
task requiring most urgent attention therefore is to consolidate the Human
Resources Division with the unit responsible for personnel planning. One
of the alms of the Third Railway Project should be to make the entire Human
Resources division operational and capable of: (i) accurately conducting
job analyses and (ii) formulating a medium and long-term personnel planning
program. The proposed training program should be revised as and when more
detailed data on personnel become available, in order to tailor it as
effectively as possible to RNCFM's needs.
Recommendations
20.       The following recommendations were agreed with RNCFM.
Training Center
21.       Incorporation of the personnel planning unit within the Training
Center (Training Department) would facilitate coordination betwen selection
and orientation, job analyses, the planning of personnel movements and
requirements, and training. Additionally, the personnel planning unit
could be strengthened by adding at least two more university-trained staff,
one of whom would be required to have a knowledge of statistics and by
providing technical assistance in the form of 12 m/m of consulting services
(6 m/m in job analysis and 6 m/m in personnel planning).
22.       Special attention should be given to the training of the Training
Center's professionals: in addition to the training courses abroad,
teacher-training seminars should be organized for them with the help of
OFERHAT (program already under way, financed by the French Cooperation
Program) and vocational-training seminars, organized jointly with the
workshops, for professionals on the production side.
CSP2
23.       Overall training costs should be reduced also since average
training costs for 1984 were so high. Cost cutting measures could include:
(i) elimination of the preparatory year for the 1985-86 academic
year, to cut the training from four to three years;



-8 -                         ANNEX 2.2
Page 6 of 7
(ii) ensuring that any new facilities have a reasonable classroom
utilization rate (70% at minimum for general education and
scientific classrooms) and an enrollment figure which would
not fall below 60 students for the three years and for the
three fields of specialization.
24.       As regards the need to upgrade the practical-training instruc-
tors, mostly foremen and production shop foremen, steps should be taken to:
(i)  intensify their teacher training with assistance from
OFERMAT (financed by French Cooperation Program) and extend
this teacher training to the other professionals in order to
augment the training capacity of each production unit.
(ii) consolidate their vocational knowledge through the partici-
pation of consultants on a short-term basis:  12 m/m of con-
sulting services would be budgeted for this purpose at the
rate of 4 m/m per year.  It is particularly important that
the task of identifying the fields of specialization requir-
ing this type of assistance be carried out conscientiously
by all the heads of the technical, administrative and
financial departments.
Training of Professionals
25.       The training of professionals would be divided into two
components:
-    training abroad
-    local training
(1)  Training abroad:  the number of fellowships will be set at
32. They will be for variable periods, ranging from one to
three months, and will be distributed over a four-year
period. It would be desirable for: (i) a committee to be
set up at the Management level, to be responsible to RNCFM;
(ii) training objectives to be prepared for each department,
together with profiles of jobs that need to be filled or up-
graded, a list of candidates, accompanied by their profes-
sional qualifications, educational background, and previous
and current professional duties, their performance rating
and their length of service with RNCFM; (iii) a preliminary
evaluation of these files to be carried out by the Training
Center, taking account of the need to match the proposed
training to the professional qualifications of the candi-
dates; (iv) the candidates to be short-listed by the same
central committee, chaired by the General Manager ar his
representative.



ANNEX 2.2
Page 7 of 7
(2) Local Training: this training could be conducted either
with the assistance of existing training centers, 1/ or with
the technical assistance of consultants.  Twelve m/m of
technical assistance will be budgeted at the rate of 3  m/m
per year.
Financing of the training component of the proposed project
26.       IDA would finance:  (i) technical assistance comprising 6 m/m for
personnel planning, 6 m/m for job analysis and 24 m/m for specific
techniques, for a total of 36 m/m of consulting services; (ii) fellowships
for training abroad for 18 professional and 14 supervisory employees, i.e.
a total of 32 fellowships; (iii) additional teaching equipment; (iv) the
construction of premises for the CSP2 courses. The total cost is estimated
at US$1,396,500 and breaks down as follows:
-  Fellowships                      202,500
-  Technical assistant              396,000
-  Teaching equipment               200,000
-  Furniture                         78,000
-  Construction                     520,000

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Wood Sleeper Production - Draft Terms of
Reference
1.        RNCFM headquartered in Antananarivo, presently operates a sleeper
production plant at Andasibe. Sleepers are made from timber cut in the
railway's own wood lot, then sized, drilled and treated (impregnated with
pentachloraphenol) at the railway facilities in Andasibe. The principal
goal of the plant is to produce sleepers sufficient for the railway's needs
but a secondary objective is to produce planks and other construction
timber sufficient for the railway and, if possible, for sale in the
commercial market. To date neither objective has been met.
2.        After an on site review of the plant's present operations, the
consultant will recommend the type of organization and equipment required
to improve efficiency and output of the operation. The consultant will
also recommend actions related to forest preservation that are necessary to
perpetuate the source of timber to the plant and estimate the optimum
production possible from the land available for such purpose.
3.        With reference to any equipment deemed necessary to improve plant
operations, the consultant will draw up detailed procurement specifications
including spare parts sufficient to ensure two years maintenance. The
consultant will also estimate the annual rate of consumption of spares.
4.        With reference to human resources, the consultant will be
required to recommend a training program to ensure the staff ha- the
expertise to implement the recommended changes and improvements including,
if necessary, facilities to accomplish the training, after taking into
account local conditions.
5.        The consultant will work closely with the Railway management and
through it contact others such as Government departments or local industry.
6.        The consultant will also review the railway's annual requirements
for sleepers and compare it to his estimate of the likely level of
sleepers the railway can produce wood garnered from its own lands. To
eliminate any gaps between supply and demand, the consultant will
investigate the availability of alternative sources of timber, evaluating
particularly the quality of wood available from other sources, and
-ecommend price guidelines to the railway for purchase.

Madagascar
Third Railway Project
Ibity Terminal - Draft Terms of Reference
1.        A new cement plant in Ibity is nearly completed but does yet have
good access to rail transport for imported raw materials and distribution
of its cement. A rail siding is being constructed off the TA line in the
direction of the plant but will take considerable time to complete.
Meanwhile, study of an interim solution for the interface between the
cement plant and the railway needs to be undertaken.
2.        Taking into account growing traffic levels as cement production
develops, transport methods and costs need to be optimized. Consultants in
transport and handling, for about 5 man-months, will analyze and recommend
solutions for these requirements.
3.        The consultants will:
(1) Reexamine and evaluate forecasted needs for raw materials
and cement production.
(2) Study the handling requirements for raw materials, in
particular coal and other imports at Toamasina, between ship
and storage, and storage and wagons.
(3) Estimate capacity and number of wagons required to transport
raw materials to the Antsirabe region for different traffic
levels.
(4) Recommend different handling methods for raw materials and
finished products for different traffic levels in the short,
medium and long-term, taking into account available road and
rail facilities.
(5) Recommend site location for an intermodal terminal if this
is found to be the optimal solution.
(6) Recommend the alignment for an access route for a rail/road
bridge across a small river.
(7) Recommend the necessary equipment (trucks, trailers, loading
equipment, fork lifts) for an intermodal terminal.
(8) Recommend future rail equipment (locomotives and wagons).

Ibity and locations of cement purchasers (railway and
truck).
(10) Estimate operating costs and investment requirements
for the recommended project (split between foreign exchange
and local costs).

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Detailed Project Cost Estimates
1,       The project was prepared by RNCFM, CCCE and Bank-financed
consultants using as reference RNCFH's 5 year investment plan. The items
included in the project comprise the higher priority elements in years
1986-88 and represent a continuation of Bank Group assistance to RNCFM
extending back to 1974.
A.   Project Objectives
2.        The Project's main objective is to support the railway's
improvement plan critical to the railway regainment of operating efficiency
by supplying the necesary foreign exchange for investments. Without the
investments, continued railroad operations over deteriorated portions of
track using old and decrepit equipment will hamper operations and limit
capacity on lines essential to the sustenance and econooic recovery of
Madagascar. More specifically the Project will continue track
rehabilitation initiated in prior projects, supply spare parts for
maintenance and rehabilitation of rolling stock including locomotives,
improve communications on a portion of the system and supply technical
assistance in areas that have become 'bottlenecks' in the plant
rehabilitation process, and training to ensure that staff can use new
equipment and carry out recommended changes. These elements of the project
should make a major contribution to ensuring viability of the northern
portion of the system. Additionally, the study portion of the project is
expected to define a course of action by which financial drain attributed
to the southern line (FCE), found to have no viable future in an earlier
study funded by the second project, can be resolved.
B.   Project Description
3.        The project covers the more important elements of three years
(1986-88) of the railway's five year investment plan and includes:
(a)  Track motor cars for track maintenance and renewal.
(b) Spare parts for locomotives and wagons.
(c) Sleepers (steel) and track fittings for track renewal.
(d) Telecomimnications-renewal on the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra
branch.
(e) Shop machinery.
(f) Tools and equipment.
(g) Bridge construction and rehabilitation.



- 14 -                Annex 4.1
Page 2 of 7
(h) Construction of a rail spur at Ibity.
(i) Training and technical assistance.
(j) Studies.
Each of the elements is discussed in more detail below.
(a) Track Motor Cars
4.        Because of worn out equipment the railway lacks sufficient means
to transport tools and men for its track gangs; rehabilitation work is
inordinately delayed as a consequence. Thirty out of a 42-motor-car fleet
are over 35 years old; five of these are beyond repair and will be replaced
with new units. The new motor cars units will be capable of moving wagons
of track material from sidings to work sites as well as transporting men
and tools.
(b) Spare Parts for Locomotives and Wagons
5.        Insufficient foreign exchange has limited the railway's
acquisition of spare parts; as a result the majority of the locomotive
fleet is now well past the mileage at which a major overhaul should have
been performed. Lack of maintenance is now seriously affecting the
availability of motive power and the need for repairs is vital. Efforts to
catch-up on locomotive maintenance was begun with funds from railways II
(Cr. 903-MAG) but a significant number of locomotives remain in need of
major repairs. Similar problems prevail with respect to the wagon fleet.
The project provides for the acquisition of wagon spare parts so that a
major repair program can be instituted for this rolling stock as well.
(c) Sleepers (steel)
6.        Wood sleepers cannot be produced in sufficient quantity to supply
the railway's plant rehabilitation needs. New sleepers are especially
needed to shore up deteriorated track on many of railway's sharp curves.
The project includes funding for a study that will assess Madagascar's
forest industry and its ability to produce wood sleepers as well as of the
ways by which the railway's present sleeper treatment facility can be made
more efficient. Until this assessment is completed and its recommendations
implemented, additional sleepers for track renewal will still be needed.
Importation of steel sleepers is the best means of meeting this need and
will be especially beneficial in repairing difficult track sections where
curves are sharp and grades are steep.
Rail Attachments
7.        If steel sleepers are imported, so must the rail attachments used
to fasten them to the track. The railway does not have a stock of these
fastenings and they are not available locally.

(d) Telecommunications
8.        Communication on the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra (MLA) line is
presently conducted using open land lines and old telephones which are no
longer manufactured and for which spare parts are not available. Moreover,
the railway has continuous problems with vandalism and vegetation damaging
the overhead wire. This branch line serves the island's chromite and rice
growing region which is critical to the needs of the country. The public
telephone system has no plans to serve this area, so replacement of the
railway's current system cannot be avoided. A study funded by CCCE
recommended the need be met with installation of an underground cable. The
solution is eminently satisfactory but also extremely expensive considering
the level of communications required on the line. A cheaper but equally
satisfactory alternative will be developed in detail as part of the project
after which installation will be undertaken. In all probability, the
choice will involve use of two-way radios. The old equipment on the line
will then be dismantled and used to extend the life of existing equipment
on other lines.
Ce) Shop Machine Tools
9.        Many of RNCFM's shop machine tools (lathes, turret drills,
planers, etc.) are beyond their useful life yet are still required to
fabricate parts normally not available in the commercial market. The
present project includes funds to replace a limited amount of these tools.
(f) Tools, Cranes and Container Equipment
10.       Container traffic is growing steadily at Antananarivo. The
present area assigned to loading and unloading, stuffing and destuffing of
containers is too small and cannot be enlarged. Loading and unloading
containers to and from wagons is handled by an old wrecking crane
permanently mounted in a stationary location. Occasionally, empty
containers are moved by a light mobile crane otherwise used for general
yard and shop duties. The project calls for the entire container to be
relocated to an area closer to the freight shed and to be equipped with a
mobile container handling fork lift.
II.       The railway needs a multi-purpose mobile crane to repair
derailments, improve productivity in maintenance of way work and to ease
shop work on rolling stock. At present RNCFM owns only one light crane
which is used for yard work in Antananarivo. The crane is not designed to
ride the rails and is limited as to the weight it can lift. Funds are
provided to obtain a more versatile unit.
12.       To continue the program of eliminating joints in track, the
railway requires materials not available locally. tNCFM also needs a
number of hand and small power tools to carry out track renewal and
maintenance. Funds for these needs are included in the project. The
project also includes funds f^r equipment and supplies to maintain engines
that cannot be obtained locaiil.

(g) Bridges - Bridge PK2 TA Line
13.       An old concrete arch bridge on the TA line is badly deteriorated
and in need of rebuilding. Sixty years old, its initial construction was
poorly built on foundations and it has been minimally maintained since.
The initial design was inadequate because it has always been too narrow and
clearances become restricted for loaded trains unless the track structure
is kept to very close tolerances. Trains on the TA line, therefore, are
restricted as to size and weights. A survey of the bridge by the railway
has not been able to suggest any reasonable method of improving its
condition within the capabilities of local construction firms or the
railway itself.
14.       Bridge specialists subsequently brought in under French financing
are currently developing a course of action; preliminary discussions with
them indicate they will recommend construction of a new bridge in the
immediate vicinity of the existing structure. The present structure is
rapidly reaching the limit of its useful life so funds for a new bridge
have been included in the project.
(h) Ibity
15.       A new cement plant at Ibity is under construction and will open
soon. The plant will require rail access to obtain coal and other
materials necessary to its operation. A rail spur to the plant is in the
process of being built. As agreed during the mission, the railway will
construct the spur as far as Vinanikarena. The final link to the plant
will be determined only after a study of transport required for the short
medium and long term for the cement plant has bee completed. The terms of
reference will be approved by the Bank and the study will be financed as
part of a PPF.
16.       Without pre-empting the results of the study but on the basis of
assumed need and preliminary assessment, it seems that truck service
between the end of the railway branch at Viranikarena and the plant would
be the most practical and least costly transport link for the short and
medium term. Such a solution will involve some additional road
construction, construction of a railway-road bridge, trucks, fork lifts,
front end loaders and transfer facilities costing about US$1 million, as
detailed below:

(i) Technical Assistance Requirements
Quarry operations                        -   6 man-months
Railway Operations                       -   8 man-months
Shop Production Planning and Control    -   8 man-months
Track Maintenance & Rehabilitation       -   8 man-months
17.       Quarry Operations.  The railway runs its own quarry to obtain
crushed rock for ballast and rock drilling, blasting and crushing are all
done by railway employees. The techniques used for drilling and blasting
however, are simplistic and old. Drilling is done by hand held air driven
drills and blasting is done using simple small sticks of dynamite and
incendiary cord. Electric blasting caps and wagon drills would increase
breakage rates and yield more uniform rock sizes for further crushing.
These more modern techniques would improve the supply of ballast, now a
limiting factor in track renewal. An estimated o man-months of technical
assistance will be required to introduce the necessary technology.
18.       Railway Operation.  The coordination between dispatching, station
and team crews is not optimized. Little advance planning is carried out
and train meets are left to local staff with no priorities outlined. Train
delays are excessive and train scheduling is followed rigidly. Two
specialists in train operations working for approx. 4 months could instruct
and demonstrate improved planning methods.
19.       Shop Production Planning and Control.  The amount of
semi-finished repairs in the main shops indicates a lack of planning and
scheduling in repair operations. While some of this is caused by a lack of
spare parts more detailed planning could improve the present situation.
Two specialists in shop control working for 4 months to train local staff
would improve production.
20.       Track Maintenance and Rehabilitation.  Track maintenance is
presently accomplished essentially by panel change out. With the train
densities that exist, other methods can be used which will maintain quality
sufficiently high for the railway but increase the speed of track renewal.
Two specialists in track repair working for 4 months could demonstrate
techniques to improve the rate of rehabilitation.
(j) Wood Sleeper Production at Andasibe
21.       The railway obtains timber to manufacture wood sleepers and some
lumber from a large tract of forested land near Andasibe. The entire wood
sleeper operation, from the cutting of the trees, removal to the processing
point, sawing and drilling, drying and chemical treatment, uses antiquated
methods and machinery. Moreover, the facility cannot produce a sufficient
quantity of sleepers or lumber to meet railway requirements for track
maintenance and rehabilitation. Worse, the production of sleepers is a
self limiting operation because no attempt has been made to practice forest
renewal or timber management.



- 18 -
Annex 4.1
Page 6 of 7
22.       The railway has requested assistance to replace the worn out
machinery used to produce wood sleepers and replace the worn out machinery
used to haul timber from the forest.
23.       Before buying the new machinery, however, the mission appraisal
team felt a study of forestry harvesting methods, forestry management an
operations should be undertaken to assure that the railway's long term
sleeper and timber production will be maintained at a level commensurate
with the capabilities of the land. Sufficient funds are included in the
Project to establish a more rational production facility and to retain
consultants to organize the operation.
24.       It has also been recommended to the railway that the Minister of
Agriculture, Department of Water and Forests be asked to investigate the
country's general ability to supply timber for sleeper production. Funds
are also included to examine this issue and to determine whether or not the
entire sleeper production operation would be more productive and profitable
if made part of a larger lumber facility operated within the private
sector.

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Rail Vs. Road
Long Term Viability of the Railway
1.        Much of the justification for the proposed project is based upon
the prediction that bulk commodities now carried by the railway will
continue to be so transported even after competing highways are completed.
One way of showing long term economic viability of the railway is to assess
the consequences of its abandonment.
2.        Reliance upon road transport for all transport needs now being
met by the railway would require: (i) importation of more trucks
(US$ 65,000 per vehicle with a five-year economic _ife); (ii) fuel import
increases; (iii) higher operating costs; and (iv) more road maintenance as
wear and tear by heavy vehicles would be increased. Against these
increases would be a decrease in railway investment.
3.        Another way of assessing the railway's long-term future is to ex-
amine the difference in tariffs between road and rail by individual como-
dity. If the tariffs are close, rail traffic could be vulnerable to diver-
sion to truck transport once highway travel is available year round, faster
more reliable, etc. Yet, as shown in the following table, rail rates for
the bulk commodities are significantly below current trucking rates. It is
unlikely, therefore, that trucks will be able to compete with the railway
for transport of these commodities, particularly as the number of service-
able heavy trucks in Madagascar is limited and likely to remain so given
foreign exchange difficulties. Lastly, truck competition on the the
Toamasina road will continue to be constrained by the difficult terrain
between the coast and Antananarivo even after the new section between
Brickaville and Moramanga is finished. The new road will not eliminate the
steep gradients and narrow curves which have proved difficult fo- heavily
loaded trucks to negotiate. Absent the railway, increasing traffic density
would necessitate upgrading and rebuilding the road to standards higher
than now contemplated. Given the overall poor condition of the main road
system in Madagascar, a significant upgrading of the Lac Alaotra-
Moramanga-Antananarivo road is likely to be a dim prospect. Upgrading of
the North-South roads, RN 4, 6 and 7, are far more important for the tran-
sport sector in the medium term.

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
FCE Viability Study - Draft Terms of Reference
1.        A 1984 study of the FCE, funded by the Bank under the Second   -
Railway Project, concluded that this portion of the Madagascar Railway
System is unprofitable and an unlikely candidate for financial turnaround.
Traffic potential is modest and there is little probability that traffic
volume could ever grow enough to support the cost of operating the line.
Moreover, the line has almost reached the end of its economic life. Large
investments must be made to rehabilitate the track if service is to be con-
tinued with a minimum of risk. Over the short term, operations of the FCE
should be subsidized until more information is available with respect to
transport alternatives for goods and passengers now served by the FCE.
2.        A consultant(s) will undertake a detailed feasibility study of
the transport needs in the area now served by RCNFM on the FCE and develop
a list of alternatives for meeting the needs economically and efficiently.
For each alternative presented, the feasibility study is to include:
I. Evaluation of Investments
The consultant will estimate the level of funds (in foreign
exchange and in FMG) for road rehabilitation and for new road
vehicles to the extent necessary to ensure that the alternative
transport system to be established will offer service equivalent
to current rail service. In addition, the consultant will esti-
mate the investment cost necessary to maintain safe rail service
at current traffic levels.
II. Evaluation of Onerating Costs
The consultant(s) will define, using operational and cost
accounting measures, the extent of FCE's actual financial defi-
cit. He will also identify cost cutting measures that could sig-
nificantly reduce the deficit. The degree to which losses could
be lessened by reducing and reassigning FCE employees is a parti-
cular requirement.
For the road alternative, the consultant will be required to
estimate (in foreign exchange and FMG) funds needed to maintain
vehicles and roadway infrastructure, using the Bank experience in
Madagascar's road maintenance. For this purpose, the available
financing and the road's actual capability on a permanent basis
to provide equivalent service will be included in the evaluation.
This analysis will define the coefficients to be applied, taking
into account the difficult site conditions and heavy rainfall.

3.        The full study should enable the Malagasy Government and
potential donors to fully evaluate and determine the optimal alternative
and, in the event a decision is made to proceed with the development of
that alternative, to establish an implementation schedule, and action plan.
