DEIOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Madagascar is a large and diverse island with good natural
endowments for agriculture. Ecological zones are varied and the
agricultural sector is equally diverse. Rice and cassava are the main food
crops, while cattle raising is common in most areas. Most exports, of
which coffee, cloves and vanilla are the most important, are of
agricultural origin though some minerals, mainly graphite, chromite and
mica, are also exported. The country's mineral resources are limited, but
recent exploration indicates good possibilities that petroleum may be found
in economically exploitable quantities. Manufacturing consists almost
entirely of consumer goods industries catering to local demand and
agro-industries.
1.02      Fourth largest island in the world, Madagascar covers an area of
about 590,000 km2. The topography is generally rugged and a central
mountain range traverses the country from north to south. The climate is
marine tropical with cyclones and heavy rainfall particularly frequent on
the east coast. The country is sparsely populated (about 15 per km2) and
the population is unevenly distributed, with about one half of all
Inhabitants occupying the central one-quarter of the island. Total
population is estimated at 9.5 million and growing at 2.5% p.a. Ninety
percent of the population work in the agricultural sector; their output
accounts for 40% of the Gross Domestic Product. Industry accounts for 14Z
of GDP and annual per capita income is about US$290. Madagascar is thus at
an early stage of development.
1.03      Prompted by economic stagnation and a resultant 12% decline in
per capita income in the 1970's, significant investments were made in all
sectors of the economy in 1979. Financed largely by foreign borrowing, the
spending boom left the country with a debt servicing burden that is
straining the economy. Economic developments over recent years reflect
the need to correct serious imbalances on external account and in the
Government budget. With generally declining exports the imbalance on
external account has had to be corrected through cutting back imports.
Imports declined steadily from 1981 through 1983; the volume of imports in
1983 was approximately 35% lower than in 1978. Imports of raw materials
and spare parts have been particularly affected with disrupting
consequences for the economy's production. The volume of GDP declined by
about 9 percent in 1981, by about a further 2 percent in 1982 and estimates
for 1983 and 1984 suggest a growth of close to 1 percent and 2 percent
respectively. Industrial output has particularly declined and there are
now serious shortages of a number of basic goods such as soaps, candles,
oils, etc. Shortages of new equipment and spare parts have affected the
transport system and greatly diminished its capacity.



B. The Transport Sector
1.04      Development of the transport sector has been influenced by: (i)
rugged topography and a tropical climate with heavy rains and frequent
cyclones; (ii) an unevenly distributed population concentrated in a few
isolated regional centers; and (iii) the lack of suitable construction
materials in some parts of the island. As a result, road construction and
maintenance is costly and less populated regions remain relatively
isolated. Transport needs are relatively well served on the central
plateau where half of the population is concentrated.
1.05      Government policy towards transport development is to:  (i)
connect regional capitals by all-weather roads; (ii) improve communications
between the centrally located capital and main seaport (the Antananarivo-
Moramanga-Toamasina road/rail corridor); (iii) improve road maintenance;
and (iv) improve the transport organizations and services. An overriding
objective is to satisfy the country's quantitative and qualitative
transport requirements at reasonable cost, respecting balance of payments
difficulties. IDA is in general agreement with these objectives. A
program of action to better coordinate measures relating to infrastructure
and means of transport has been established for the 1984-1987 period. It
seeks to: (i) coordinate and plan transport, with regard to services,
complementarity, infrastructure, and pricing; (ii) improve the quality of
service by introducing competition between the different types of transport
and, where possible, between different operators of a given type of
transport; Ciii) reorganize training of infrastructure specialists and
transport company personnel; (iv) rehabilitate transport companies by
importing sufficient quantities of spares and tyres and through regular
upkeep of infrastructure; and (v) replace obsolete transport material and
kee', the fleet properly maintained. Other objectives relate to the general
development of Madagascar. The overall policy goals are to provide
transport at lower cost and to reduce regional isolation through
rehabilitation of the secondary road network.
1.06      Several ministries and Government organizations share
responsibility for the transport sector: the Ministry of Transport,
Supplies and Tourism (Ministere des Transports, du Ravitaillement et du
Tourisme, MTRT) and the Ministry of Public Works (Ministere des Travaux
Publizs, MTP) play the most important role. MTRT is responsible for road,
rail, air and water transport, and oversees several autonomous Government
agencies, including the Madagascar Railway, Air Madagascar, the Port of
Toamasina, and the shipping companies. MIP is responsibile for planning,
building and maintaining highways, ports and airports.
1.07      Other Government agencies whose responsibilities affect transport
policy include: the Ministry of Commerce (MC), the Ministry of Agriculture
(Ministere de la Production Agricole et de la Reforme Agraire, MPARA), the
Director General of Planning (Direction Generale du Plan, DGP), and the
regional governments. MC's responsibility to collect and market crops
significantly affects road transport capacity and its price control of
basic commodities influences transport tariffs. The supply of transport
services is also affected by MC, through its establishment of policies on
the importation and assembly of motor vehicles, as well as its



determination, with the Central Bank, of foreign exchange allocations for
import. MPARA and the military operate large state-owned road transport
enterprises. Also, each regional government has established a regional
trucking company in the last four years.
1.08      As of early 1984, MTRT's Director of Planning is charged with
transport sector planning. The director's main task is to coordinate
transport investment plans with other agencies, which also prepare project
and investment proposals. Pending the completion of a National Transport
Plan expected in 1986, the DGP began to establish a Public Investment
Program (PIP) with assistance primarily from MTRT and MTP for the transport
sector. IDA and other bilateral and multilateral aid agencies have helped
improve sector planning, but more assistance is needed. Under the Sixth
Highway Project, planning has improved through the establishment of a
planning department in the MTRT with technical assistance partly financed
by French aid and partly by IDA. After consulting with other sectors such
as agriculture, the planning effort yielded a priority -Economic Road
Network list of about 10,000 km (4300 km paved roads, 3300 km engineered
earth roads and 2400 km of feeder roads). This was the agreed basis for
the IDA Sixth Highway Project.
C. The Transport Network
1.09      Madagascar is naturally dependent as an island upon mainline
shipping for its transport link with the outside world. There are four main
ports, 18 lighterage ports and a navigable canal along the east coast. The
country's internal transportation infrastructure includes an extensive but
poor road network, two rail &ections of considerable length and a
well-developed air network^. Nevertheless Madagascar's transportation
infrastructure is inadequate in that it fails to provide access to all
productive areas of the country. The country's lifeline, between the port
of Toamasina and the central plateau area where most of the population
lives, consists of a railway line and a badly maintained old road of modest
original specifications. This road is currently being partially replaced
by a new highway. Costly transport construction, poor road maintenance and
inadequate overland communications has led to the develonment in Madagascar
of an extensive system of ports and coastal shipping as well as an air
transport network denser than in most comparable countries.
Road Transport
1.10      About 5,200 km. of Madagascar's nearly 50,000 km. of roads are
paved. The paved highway network now corsists of a main north-south link
connecting Mahajunga on the west coast with Antananarivo (the capital) and
Fianarantsoa in the highlands (parts of which can sustain use by heavy
vehicles), and an east-west road (RN2) linking Moramanga, Antananarivo and
Toamasina. A new paved section of the Toamasina-Moramanga road is
providing all-weather transit between Moramanga and Brickaville on the
coast. While this recent development has greatly improved road
communications between Antananarivo and Toamasina, heavy truck traffic will
continue to be constrained because the highland Moramanga-Antananarivo (115
km) road, as most of the island's roads, is of low standard, narrow, badly



- 4 -
aligned and in poor condition. The Bank is assisting in rehabilitating the
Mahajunga-Antananarivo road, RN 4, under the Sixth Highway Project.
1.11      Total vehicles in 1984 numbered 42,000, of these some 13,000 or
31Z are trucks and pickups. By contrast, in 1976 there were 104,000
vehicles, 47% of which were commercial. Passenger transport is provided by
cooperative and individual carriers and regulated by MTRT and provincial
authorities. Entry to the industry for passenger transport is nominally
screened by the Government on the basis of supply and demand, but in
practice is generally open for capable applicants. Transport tariffs have
been determined within a minimum-maximum rate system established by MTRT.
MTRT on the basis of these rates determined official rates for
interprovincial traffic, and intraprovincial rates were set by provincial
authorities. Since these rates have been lagging behind cost inflation,
particularly the rates for transport of goods have generally not been
enforced by the government. Under the Sixth Highway Project, the Bank has
urged further liberalization, which has been studied by MTRT through its
new planning directorate. The government, at negotiations, confirmed the
importance of the road transport sector as well as its support for the
vital agriculture sector. The government objective, based on the above
studies, is to create sound competition between transporters taking into
account the present limiting factors such as a run-down road network, an
ageing transport fleet, and lack of spare parts. Concerning route
restrictions the only present constraints, those concerning RN2, the main
road between Antananarivo and Toamasina, will be removed.  The Government
also reaffirmed the principle of free transport of goods. Concerning
tariffs, the principle is liberty by transporters to establish rates.
Nevertheless the government reserves the right to intervene in exceptional
circumstances, such as or services or routes without free competition. To
assist transporters in their ratesetting the government will begin to
publish average operating costs for different vehicles. The government
will also improve compliance with measures of vehicle weight control and
redefine the role of joint transport operators.
Air Transport
1.12      By regional standards, Madagascar has developed a dense domestic
air transport network in response to the distance between population
centers, the rugged terrain, costly construction and the poor condition of
surface transport.   There are 56 airports, 17 of which are built to all-
weather standards and five of which are suitable for international flights;
the remainder are gravel or grass strips. The international airport at
Antananarivo handles 50Z of all traffic; 15 small airports generate 30% of
the traffic; and 40 very small airports share the remaining 20% of total
traffic. Service to many small airports is not financially profitable but
ensures access to otherwise isolated areas.
1.13      Air Madagascar, 80% owned by the Government, 18% by Air France
and 2% by private shareholders, provides international service to Paris,
Marseilles, several countries in East Africa and al' domestic service.
Aircraft in its fleet include a B-747 (combination cargolpassengers) for
European service, two B-737s for domestic and regional service, two HS-748s



and five Twin Otters for domestic service, and several samller aircraft for
air-taxi and charter services.  In 1984, Air Madagascar's successfully re-
negotiated maturities on Its long-term debt obligations to foreign banks,
and in 1985 began a financial recovery program.
Ports and Coastal Shipping
1.14      Madagascar relies on maritime shipping for foreign trade but
coastal shipping is also important. Indeed, shipping by water is the only
means of transporting freight between many areas of the country with no
access to all-weather roads. There are four main ports: Toamasina, the
main international port serving the populated central highlands via the
railway, handles 55Z of the total traffic; Mahajunga handles IIZ;
Antseranana in the north 5Z; and Toliara in the south, about 4Z. The
remaining 25Z of traffic is handled by smaller coastal shipping ports. The
port of Toamssina has adequate capacity to handle present traffic, but
operations are hampered by low labor productivity and lack of spare parts
for equipment. This port is administered by a separate agency, Societe
d'Exploitation du Port de Toamasina (SEPT), whereas other parts are under
the direction of MTRT. The increasing constraints on the railway's
transport capacity has led to the diversion of soue international traffic
to the port of Mahajunga. Capacity there is limited, however, as the port
requires lightering and the subsequent transfer inland of goods is
restricted by the condition of tbe road connecting Nahajunga to the capital
(RN4). Rehabilitation of the worst sections of RN4 is included in the
ongoing Sixth Highway Project.
1.15      The Societe Halgache des Transports Maritimes (SMTM), the state
controlled international shipping line, operates three cargo vessels for
the country's externally traded merchandise. Coastal shipping is handled
primarily by the Compagnie Malgache de Navigation (CNN), 921 state-owned,
and private ship owners.
1.16      Government objectives toward coastal shipping and ports are to
improve efficiency. A survey of shipping services was performed in 1983
with French aid in order to work out a policy to rehabilitate and develop
the country's ports. The survey will be supplemented by ongoing engineer-
ing studies to better forecast capital expenditures. Additionally, re-
placement of port handling equipment in the secondary ports has begun and
will continue, chiefly with assistance from the Federal Republic of
Germany. In future, a series of measures and actions, such as port re-
habilitation and renewal of navigational aids, are recommended for the
1986-1990 period. The Bank is preparIng a Ports Rehabilitation Project,
which was appraised in 1985. Portions of the intracoastal waterway on the
East Coast are now being rehabilitated with AfDB financing but traffic is
expected to be light.
D. Present and Future Role of the Railway
1.17      The railway consists of two unconnected single track systems (Map
IBRD #13645R). The northern system (about 700 track km) revolves around
the capital and includes (i) a line -TCE- between Antananarivo, the
capital, and Toamasina, the principal port (375 km); (ii) a line -TA- from
Antananarivo to Antsirabe, an industrial and population center south of the



capital (154 km); and (iii) a section -iMLA- north from Moramanga to the
agricultural IDgion of Lake Alaotra and the chromite mines (167 km). The
southern system -FCE- (163 km) connects the regional center of Fianarantsoa
and the agricultural areas in the southern plateau to the port of
Manakara. The Antananarivo-Toamasina line is the most important link,
since it is still the most reliable-means of surface transport between the
country's main seaport and the capital city. The railways are operated by
the Reseau Natfonal des Chemins de Fer Nalagasy (RNCFH), a parastatal
agency unde: the supervision of MTRT,described in more detail in chapter
II. NTRT's paramount aim with respect to rail transport is to ensure that
the existing network is rehabilitated before any expansion of capacity is
undertaken. Other aims are to improve network managment and monitoring of
capital expenditures.
1.18      The railway's role is fundamental to Madagascar's transportation
needs. Rail is the main mode of transport, both for cargo and passengers,
between the most populated and economically developed parts of the
country. Almost half the island's population lives in areas directly
served by the raidlway and the railway has, until now, been virtually the
sole carrier of freight imports from the main port to the main population
centers located in the highlands. Completion of a new all-weather road
from Brickaville to Moramanga, however, has brought competition for the
railway along part of the TCE line and this has been taken into account in
designing the proposed project.
1.19      The long term prospects are that the railway will continue to be
the most economical mode of transport for a large proportion of the rail-
way's present traffic: bulky and heavy commodities such as petroleum
products, ores, grain, fertilizer, wood, etc. Even with the improvements,
competing roads will not be built to standards that would eliminate the
need for rail transport. Diversion to road of railway cargo and passenger
traffic will also be affected by the deteriorated condition of Madagascar's
road vehicles. Replacement of present vehicles requires foreign exchange
that will be difficult to obtain given the present constrained economic
situation.
1.20      Also favoring the railway over the long term ia the climate and
topography of Madagascar. Heavy rains and frequent cyclones often cause
landslides and inundation of roadworks. First of the modes to be
established, the railway was built on the route best aligned and least
vulnerable to landsides. Furthermore, the railway has developed the insti-
tutional and technical capacity to maintain, service, and repair its in-
frastructure in a reasonably efficient way. Rail, therefore, is likely to
remain the most reliable mode.
1.21      The Southern line (FCE), from the port of Manakara to
Fianarantsoa, also faces competition from a recently built road on the
coastal plain. The road is not entirely new; however, a 35 km section is
in poor condition and at least another 50 km needs rehabilitation. The
needed repair work is estimated to cost about US$4.0 million and is includ-
ed in the MTP road investment plan but it has a relatively low priority.
The road between Fianarantsoa and the coast is poorly aligned and is 100 km
longer than the railway. Yet traffic density on the FCE is still light and



- 7 -
likely to remain so; a study concluded that the most economical long-term
solution would be to close this link. Until adequate road transport can be
provided, however, operation of the FCE will continue.   Transport planning
for the area now served by the Southern line has been studied under a
Project Preparation Facility requested by the Government. Based on the
study, the Government has submitted an Action Plan satisfactory to the IDA
regarding the Southern line (para. 7.01).
E. Bank Group Role in Transport
1.22       Bank involvement in the transport sector in Madagascar is
substantial. Between 1974 and 1984 the Bank supported nine transport
projects with IDA Credits totalling just over US$100 million, six in
highways, one in ports, and two in railways. The Bank has and should
continue to play a critical role in improving the railway's institutional
capacity and policy framework. The Bank has supported two projects in the
rail sector.
1.23     The Madagascar First Railway Project (Credit 488-MAG;, approved
in 1972, called for the expenditure over a three year period of US$6
million for 62 km of track renewal, purchase of rolling stock and provision
of consulting services to improve managerial, operational and financial
policies and practices. As described in the June 26s 1984 Project
Performance Audit Report, the Project was a -holding operation' that
successfully benefited the people of Madagascar by keeping the railway
operational." At the same time, underestimated costs and delays in
implementation resulted in a scaling downward of tue initial project;
completion took 3 years longer than estimated; the overall estimated return
was less than 1OZ; and RNCFM's financial and institutional performance was
poor.
1.24     The Madagascar Second Railway Project (Credit 903-MAG), approved
in 1979, involved the expenditure over a five year period of US$43.7
million. The Bank Group provided US$13 million of this total while the
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) provided US$20.5 million.
Objectives of this project were: (1) renewal and improvement of 284 km of
track; (ii) replacement of 7 locomotives and purchase of 1 rail car, 10
coaches and 76 freight wagons; (iii) improvement of telecommunications;
(iv) replacement of workshop equipment; (v) improvement of the railway's
financial management; and (vi) implementation of more market-based pricing
strategies. Delays and lower tham anticipated ballast and sleeper
production resulted in fewer lines being rehabilitated than planned (123 km
vs. 180 km) and low cost estimates reduced the number of wagons and coaches
actually purchased. Track renewal totalling 60 km out of 74 km initially
planned was accomplished on the TCE line while only 63 km out of 106 km
initially planned were renewed on the MLA line.
1.25     During the course of Railway II the Government continued to be
reluctant to institute tariff reform until the Bank suspended disbursement
of the Credit between March and October 1982. As described elsewhere
(para. 6.01), RNCFM increased tariffs and made a significant financial
turnaround. Government zas now agreed to more efficient rail operations



- 8 -
and more appropriate pricing. Railway management has made significant pro-
gress in the areas of planning and cofting. The Second Railway Project can
be credited for creating this turnaround as well as for keeping operational
the most critical element in the island's transportation infrastructure
even though returns on some of the project's individual components were not
fully realized. Operational improvements have been realized as well.
Derailments have dropped from a high of 92 in 1980 to 44 in 1983. The
Credit 903-iHG has been fully disbursed.
1.26      The railway reported a profit in 1983 and 1984 and is in
compliance with the revenue covenant of Railway IITs Credit Agreement.
As part of the evolution of RNCPK towards a commercially oriented
institution, the Bank has advocated a program of cost reductions and a
flexible managemenr approach adjusting quickly to changes in competitor's
behavior and customer needs. Progress of this dialogue has so far been
encouraging, and it has been a major accomplishment of Railway II.
1.27      There were some lessons  - be learned from Railway II:  the
traffic forecasts estimated at al_ aisal were too high; the track
rehabilitation targets were too ambitious; and the appraisal of technical
and managerial skills and experience of INCFM's staff did not take
sufficiently into account their need for training and technical
assietance. These lessons are reflected in the design of the proposed
Project. Investments are limited to the elements required to ensure that
service is maintained at essentially the current level and that realistic
operating objectives are achieved; Project implementation targets have
been set at levels to reflect past achievements; and, most importantly,
training and technical assistance have been given a higher emphasis in the
project mix.
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.28      Transport is a key sector in the Bank's lending strategy in
Madagascar because transport constrains economic development in other
sectors as indicated in the Transport Sector Memorandum (TSM). The Bank
has invested heavily and has seen results: (i) a gradually increasing
emphasis on rehabilitation versus new investments; (ii) progress towards
the creation of a highway maintenance institution; and (iii) increased
management and filnancial autonomy for the Railway which enabled it to carry
out significant tariff reform. The Bank has been promoting an integrated
approach to transport to help Madagascar's economy, to maintain an ongoiug
dialogue with the Government with a view toward furthering policy reform,
and to-balance Bank presence among subsectors. For the forthcoming ports
rehabilitation project to succeed, for example, the railways must remain
operable to ensure an efficient flow of goods from the ports. The IFAD
Hlghlands Rice Project is also dependent on railway transport for
fertilizer and other agricultural inputs from Toamasina to Antuirabe, while
the Lac Alaotra Rice Intensification Project must rely on railway service
to deliver most of its production to consumers.



II . RESEAU NATIONAL DES CHEMINS DE FER HAIAGASY (RNCFM)
A. Introduction
2.01      Madagascar's railway was built at the beginning of this century
to consolidate the colonial power's military presence. It has evolved into
an essential transport service that is a virtual life line between access
to the outside world at Toamasina's main deep water port and the country's
capital and central highlands, where half of the population resides.
2.02      Until 1965 RNCFM operated as a -Regie Autonome' under the old
Ministry of Transport with a substantial degree of autonomy. Since then
the railway passed through various forms of state control, from functioning
as a Government department to its present form as a state-owned
establishment under Decree No. 82-014 from 1982. NTRT oversees RNCFM.
2.03      Re-establishment of the railway as a public industrial and
commercial establishment was done in 1974 at the urging of the Bank Group
to grant the railway a legal status with operational and financial
autonomy. The Bank did so to isolate and better evaluate the effect on the
railway of general Government transport policies to expand infrastructure,
increase direct public investment, impose regulations and set prices.
Plant and equipment maintenance had been given a low priority and the
transport system deteriorated. At the Bank's urging, RNCFM gained
significant operational independence, but its financial management did not
achieve sufficient autonomy from the Ministry of Finance until the early
1980's (para. 6.01).
2.04     Once independence had been achieved in principle, the Bank began
pressing the Government to institute more cost-based tariffs and to
implement institutional improvements that strengthen financial discipline
and independence. A Bank Transport Sector Memorandum (TSM) was issuel in
1983 to assist the Government in re-orienting its transport policies. The
memorandum advocated: (1) financial recovery for transport enterprises;
(2) increased efficiency in the road transport industry; (3) improved
pricing; (4) priority for rehabilitation and maintenance rather than new
investments; (5) improved sector planning; and (6) increased training and
technical assistance. The Government has agreed to allow private
transporters to compete on equal terms with the public sector.
2.05      Toward that end the government has begun to permit more appro-
priate pricing of competing modes and to increase the freedom of railway
management. In addition to the pricing improvements the Bank is also
urging the deregulation of commercial haulage of goods on interprovincial
roads.
B. Track Infrastructure
2.06      RNCFM operates about 860 km of main line railway and some 175 km
industrial branch lines and private sidings, for a total track length of
1,035 km.  The system is single-tracked and the gauge is one meter.  The



- 10 -
railway actually consists of two separate and unconnected systems: the
northern system, with about 700 km of track, connects the capital,
Antananarivo, to industrial areas in the plateau region and to the main
deep water port of Toamasina on the Indian Ocean; the southern system,
about 160 km of track, connects the semi-industrial town of Fianarantsoa
and the agricultural areas in the southern plateau region to the port of
Manakara, also on the Indian Ocean (map IBRD #13645R).
2.07      Madagascar's central platedu region, where much of the population
lives, is at altitudes of 1,200 to 1,500 m. From the coast to the
highland, the railway has to climb considerable grades and cross some very
rugged terrain. Gradients of 2.5% are frequent and some are even as high
as 3.5%. Curve radii are smaUl, dow to 50 m. The difficult terrain
explains why this system has 362 bridges and 94 tunnels. These conditions
make maintenance difficult, rehabilitation projects expensive, and speed
restrictions common. Frequent heavy rains and cyclones exacerbate railway
wear and tear.
2.08      There are 86 stations with an average distance of 10 km between
them, and a large number of other stops near large towns are used for
suburban passenger traffic. The maximum distance between stations is:
17.3 km on the TCE; 19.4 km on the TA; and 18.4 km on the FCE. The large
numbers of stations and stops is largely related to passenger service,
which has been declining in recent years. If this trend continues as
projected, RNCFM should close some stations.
2.09      Marshalling yards are located at Toamasina, Antananarivo and
Moramanga on the northern system and at Fianarantsoa and Manakara on the
southern system. The yards are, therefore, in the main points of origin or
destination for the bulk commodities transported by the railway.
Marshalling of traffic is not as efficient as could be because the railway
lacks a mobile crane and proper lifting facilities for containerized
traffic.
2.10      Track conditions in general require improvement. The rate at
which work is accomplished is slow and therefore even more expensive than
warranted. Some of the rail procured under the Second Railway Project has
yet to be installed. Repairs are concentrated on the worst sections so
track work is not necessarily done in the most methodological order. To
address these deficiencies, RNCFM has requested the technical assistance
proposed under the Project (para. 4.10).
2.11      Track is composed of 25, 26 and 30 kg/m rail laid on timber
sleepers except in sharp curves where steel sleepers have been used. Closer
sleeper spacing and more ballast is needed. The railway is old and for
years was not well maintained. Since the early 1970's, RNCFM has been
gradually trying to rehabilitate and upgrade the track. Under Railway II,
the oldest and most worn out rail on the TCE has been replaced. Most of
the rail on the entire MIA section, however is over 60 years old; ballast
is sparse; and the sleepers, fasteners and fishplates are in poor
condition. The rate at which work is accomplished is slow and therefore



- 11 -
even more expensive than warranted.   Today approximately 120 km of rail on
the TCE segment is less than 5 years old while 255 km is between 25 and 45
years old. The track improvement component of this Project is for the
worst portion of the MLA segment (paras 4.03, 5.19-5.22).
2.12      In general, the bridges and viaducts are in fair condition but
various structural members have been damaged in derailments and must be
strengthened, repaired or replaced. Bolts and rivets must be replaced or
tightened and bridge seats need to be cleaned and greased. The proposed
Project includes the rebuilding of one very old bridge as well as repairs
to another (para. 4.04).
C. Signalling and Telecommunications
2.13      A train order system is used to direct trains.  Signals exist
only at the approech to Antananarivo. All trains are controlled by phone
to the stations from Antananarivo on the northern system and from
Fianarantsoa on the southern system. The methods of control are adequate
for the traffic involved.
2.14      The telecommunications system on the TCE Line was modernized
recently by laying a new cable underground along the line and by providing
all stations except Antananarivo with new equipment. On the other lines,
the system is old, in poor r'.ndition and much o' the equipment is
obsolete. Repair and selective renewal of this system are required.
Yet spare parts are no longer manufactured. Repair can be accomplished by
using serviceable spare parts from old equipment released as a consequence
of the replacements proposed in the Project (para. 4.08).
D. Motive Power and Rolling Stock
2.15      RNCFM is fully dieselized.  The present locomotive fleet consists
of 33 line locomotives, 10 railcars and 24 shunters. Eleven 750 horsepower
locomotives are now over 30 years old and must be progressively retired as
spare parts are no longer available. All are due for major overhaul. CCCE
has agreed to finance the purchase of four locomotives which should satisfy
RNCFM's motive power needs (paras. 3.06 and 3.08). The 500 horsepower
railcars are 26 years old and also lack spare parts. The small shunters
are 30 years old but remain serviceable. Most gang trolleys for track
work, bowever, are very old and some need replacement.
2.16      The passenger cars (58) and freight wagons (967) are in fair
condition. Except for 5 new passenger coaches, they vary in age from 16 to
36 years. Their availability is relatively high and the fleet is adequate
for the traffic handled at the present time. As container business
increases, however, demand for more flat wagons may require a conversion of
some of the non-covered wagons.
E. Workshops and Depots
2.17      Equipment maintenance and major overhauls are done in the
wo-Ashops in Antananarivo.  Depots for minor locomotive service are located
in Antananarivo, Moramanga, Manangareza and Fianarantsoa and sub-depots at



- 12 -
Antsirabe, Mororano and Anivoramo. RNCFM's equipment maintenance is far
less effective than it could be due to lack of spare parts, tools and other
machinery necessary to more easily move and repair broken cars and
locomotives.
F. Container Handling Facilities
2.18      Container traffic is developing steadily between Toamasina and
Antananarivo and is starting to expand to Antsirabe. Container loading and
unloading facilities at Toamasina are up to date and are operated by the
Port Authority. RNCFM's inland container facilities in Antananarivo, how-
ever, are overtaxed and incapable of handling the increasing business.
Installation of a new more spacious facility located closer to the freight
shed and equipped with a container handling fork lift would vastly improve
operations (para 4.07). Antsirabe's present container facilities are
sufficient to handle current volume but may require upgrading in the future
as business develops.
G. Traffic
2.19      Traffic carried by the railway, particularly the northern system,
is critical to Madagascar's economy. Without rail transport, the local
production of rice would be more expensive and mining of chromite ore in
the Lac Alaotra region would be uneconomic at current international
prices. Rail is also the primary means of transporting other bulk
commodities, such as petroleum, grain, chemicals and construction
materials, to the central highlands.
2.20      The total volume of goods shipped by rail varies with economic
conditions in Madagascar: GDP and foreign exchange availability ultimately
dictate rail traffic levels. As can be seen in Table 2.1, freight volume
dropped 35% from 1975 to 180.5 million ton-km in 1981; since then, it
increased 24Z. to 224.1 million ton-km in 1984.

2.21      Passenger traffic has also declined;  1984 levels on the northerin
system were 28Z lower than 1979's high of 262.1 million passenger-km. A
more detailed discussion of current and future traffic levels is contained
in Chapter V. (paras. 5.05-5.16)
H. Organization
Management
2.22      RNCFM is managed by a Director General, under general supervision
of a Board of Directors. The Board has 12 members from Government
ministries and is presided over by the Minister of Transport, Supplies and
Tourism. Since 1982, the quality of management has improved. The senior
management team, led by a most dynamic and dedicated General Manager, is
competent and motivated.
2.23      The organizational structure of the Railway is by categories of
rail asset, such as rail, ties, and equipment, or by function such as
training, purchasing, special police. There is no grouping of these
responsibilities into profit centers or into functional lines of operation
such as maintenance of way, maintenance of equipment, traffic, train
operatioas, yard operations and so forth. Marketing is being organized as
a separate department but there is no separate traffic, tariff or passenger
department. An organization chart is attached (Chart I).
Staff
2.24      In December 1984 RNCFM had 4,000 permanent and 850 temporary
employees. Approximately 3% are managers, 10% are supervisors and 87% are
operational personnel. Employee levels are somewhat lower than in recent
years. Staff turnover is low. In 1984, a total of 90 employees left for
all reasons; about 350 people will become eligible for retirement over the
next five years. A large number of these staff are highly experienced and
their replacements will require considerable training.
Working Environment
2.25     As a whole the staff is hardworking and enthusiastic.  Basic wages
are equivalent to those of the civil service although regulations provide
for several bonuses and allowances. Promotion often requires competitive
examination and certain key posts are accessible only through internal
promotion (inspector, chief auditor, shop foreman, chief district
inspector, etc.).
2.26      Physical working conditions are fair.  The offices are small and
the office equipment is often inadequate. The physical plant at the
central depot in Antananarivo is unsatisfactory: the lighting system is
poor, the car inspection pits are frequently full of dirty oil, hand tools
are in short supply and sometimes unsuitable. Labor is organized in
unions, but industrial relations are relatively good by country standards.

I. Training
2.27      Despite Limited resources, RNCFM has paid special attention to
personnel training. Over the 1963-73 period, primary emphasis was placed
on the training of senior supervisory staff via Second-Level Advanced
Vocational Training Courses (Cours Superieurs Professionnels du 2e degre -
CSP2) and on evening training courses for operating personnel. Since then
training has broadened to include: (i) special short-term refresher and
advanced training courses for professionals; (ii) regular, CSP2 courses;
and (iii) apprenticeships for the training of skilled workers. Annex 2.2
describes the present training programs in more detail.
2.28      RNCFM's training center is, however, seriously lacking in
physical and technical resources. The center has four classrooms (with a
capacity for 70, 80, 25 and 25 students, respectively), which serve the
CSP2, the apprenticeship and the refresher training. One of the rooms
doubles as a library and a classroom at the same time. Teaching materials
are virtually non-existent; the apprenticeship workshop does not have
enough of the tools or measuring instruments essential to practical work.
The audio-visual equipment consists of one projector. The copying
equipment needed for the correspondence course is decrepit. The library
consists of 200 books, none of which is more recent thaa 1970. Human
resources, however, are well used. RNCFM offers attractive incentives to
induce experienced staff to teach others and recently overall management of
training has been given high status within the railway hierarchy. The
proposed project would provide the required physical facilities, teaching
equipment, overseas fellowships and technical assistance (para 4.09).

III. RNCFM'S INVESTMENT PLAN
3.01      Although RNCFM has made improvements in accounting and financial
controls, the railway still lacks expertise in making long term financial
and strategic plans. RNCFM does prepare annual operating and investment
budgets but they are not used as management tools and their purpose is more
related to estimating foreign exchange needs than to long term strategies
of the railroad within the context of Madagascar's economy and total
transport needs.
3.02      To fill the gap in personnel and to meet long term planning
needs, the Bank funded the preparation of an initial investment plan for
the 1978-1985 period as part of the First Railway Project. Since then,
RNCFM has continued to rely heavily upon consultants, and upon Bank
guidance and analyses, in planning capital budgets and developing operating
strategies for the future. The initial investment plan was revised by
consultants into a shorter 1979-1983 Investment Plan that served as the
basis for the Second Railway Project. As mentioned earlier (para. 1.24),
there was some slippage in carrying out the Second Railway Project's track
improvements and actual traffic levels in the last several years were lower
than those forecast for the 1979-1983 Investment Plan. To reflect these
developments, RNCFM has prepared, with assistance from consultants, a new
five year investment plan for 1985-1989. This plan was revised at
appraisal to reflect more realistic traffic projections and the railway's
long term role in meeting Madagascar's transportation needs. The plan,
which emphasizes improving efficiency and rehabilitation, forms the basis
for the proposed Project.
3.03      RNCFM's original investment plan assumed that the railway's
traffic levels will increase in direct proportion to increases in GDP. In
the past, rail traffic has proved to be so related but the one-to-one
relationship is not expected to continue as other modes improve conditions
and increase their share of the Madagascar transport network. The opening
of the road between Brickaville and Moramanga and the improvements proposed
on the road between Moramanga and Antananarivo have increased road
competition with rail traffic, both passenger and freight. RNCFM's
original forecast, however, envisioned no such competition.
3.04      In the near term increased truck competition may be limited by
the relatively small number of highway vehicles in Madagascar, but the
convenience and time savings associated with use of the road will
ultimately lead to the purchase of as many new road vehicles as foreign
exchange availability will permit. The railway's role in the long term,
therefore, will be to handle bulk commodlties that are not time sensiti-e.
As is the case in many countries, the railway's future lies in reliable
performance, moving goods that are above the capacity of a road structure
to handle and for which tariffs can be less than any other form of
competition.

3.05      Madagascar's rail traffic therefore, is unlikely to increase
significantly even if the economy continues to grow and rebound from nearly
a decade of decline. More likely, overall traffic will stabilize at the
current level: losses of passenger and short haul freight traffic to road
transport are expected to be offset by increases in bulk traffic. The
revised Investment Plan, as agreed to by RNCFM and the Bank, is itemized in
Table 3.1.
3.06      The railway's original plan called for 6 locomotives, a railcar,
5 passenger coaches, 10 freight wagons (of a series of 30), a high cost
cable telecommunications system for the MLA, more machine tools, more
equipment and higher costs for the bridge at PK2 of the TA line.  It also
envisioned much higher local costs for track rehabilitation and the
installation of a branch line all the way to the cement plant being built
at Ibity. In consultation with CCCE, which is financing the agreed to
investment in 1985, locomotives were reduced to four and the railcar and 5
passenger coaches were eliminated.
3.07      The Investment Plan address RNCFM's human resources development
needs as well as its need to repair physical assets and maintain current
service levels. Track renewal will improve service reliability, travel
times and car availability. Reducing the number of employees and
implementing more advanced ballast-production methods, more systematic
equipment maintenance procedures, and better methods of sleeper production
are also necessary. Such measures will improve completion times as well as
raise the rate of return on track and equipment rehabilitation. The
proposed technical assistance and training components described in
Annex 4.1 and paras. 4.09-4.10 aim to achieve these objectives.
3.08      The proposed Project was based on those items that comprised the
highest priority elements in the three mid years, 1986-88, of RNCFM's
original Five Year Plan. CCCE has agreed to finance expenditures planned
for 1985. In 1989 and beyond, additional investments will be required to
continue the track renewal program, but no major capital investments are
forseen, barring an unexpected surge in traffic. The actual components
included in the Plan, however, were scaled back from RNCFM's original
capital budget to levels more consistent with the outlook for the railway.
The Investment Plan now includes only those improvements and additions to
plant and equipment necessary to maintain service at present levels. The
Government has agreed that it will not allow RNCFM to undertake any
investments which are not included in this Investment Plan unless the
economic justification of such investment has been established in
consultation with IDA (para 7.01). The investment plan will be reviewed
and updated yearly between IDA and RINCFM. Cyclone repairs (para 4.12) have
not been included in these plans.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01      The main objective of the Project is to ensure that Madagascar's
northern railways system operates at a reasonable level of efficiency over
the next 5 to 10 years. In order to enable RNCFM to maintain service at
the current level of capacity, the rehabilitation program initiated with
the Second Railways Project (CR. 903-MAG) will continue with an emphasis on
selected high priority investments for track rehabilitation, supply of
spare parts for maintenance of rolling stock including locomotives,
provision of essential equipment for workshop and maintenance,
telecommunication improvements, training of key staff, and technical
assistance to address specific operating problems.
B. Project Scope
4.02      As explained in Chapter III, the proposed project will consist of
RNCFM's Investment Plan for 1986-88 as revised and agreed to by the Bank.
In particular, the proposed Project will comprise the following components:
(a)  Permanent Way. Rehabilitation of about 60 km of track on
the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra line; reconstruction of a bridge
on the Antananarivo-Antsirabe line; and construction of
ancillary facilities for a cement plant located near
Antsirabe;
Cb) Rolling Stock. Provision of spare parts for locomotive and
wagons, and of five gang trolleys for track maintenance;
Cc)  Shop machinery, tools, and other equipmen_;
(d) Telecommunications. Provision of a low cost radio
telecommunication system for the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra line;
(e) Training;
(f) Technical Assistance;
(g) Studies; and
(h) Cyclone Damage repairs.
C. Project Description
(a) Permanent Way
4.03     About 60 km of track on the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra line will be re-
habilitated because the main track components are beyond repair. (para.
5.19-5.22) The work will use steel sleepers and rail attachments for track
sections with many curves; Madagascar's production of wood sleepers is
limited and their quality is better suited for normal maintenance
replacements. The longer term objective of the Government is to eliminate
dependence on imported sleepers while improving production, possibly by
devolving this activity to the private sector. The terms of reference of
the study included in the Project (para. 4.11) will address this objective.



- 21 -
4.04      A 60 year-old concrete arch bridge on the Antananarivo-Antsirabe
line has deteriorated because of poor initial design, original type of con-
struction, old age, and lack of adequate maintenance. This bridge will be
rebuilt. Additionally, loading and unloading facilities will be improved,
and a 6 km road link and a small bridge will be built for the nearly
completed Ibity cement plant located near Antsirabe. The combined road and
rail access to the plant is expected to be cheaper than building a 20 km
railway spur, as riginally envisaged by RNCFM, and will be sufficient to
handle transport of coal and other inputs to the plant, a traffic estimated
to reach 26,000 tons by 1990 (para 5.23).
(b) Rolling Stock
4.05      Essential spare parts for locomotives and wagons will be provided
to maintain and repair the fleet. Past shortages have resulted in deferred
maintenance which has seriously affected car and engine availability.
The major repair program iniciated under Railway II therefore must
continue. Also, five gang trolleys will be purchased to alleviate the
acute shortage of reliable transport of tools, materials and workers for
track maintenance and repairs.
Cc) Shop Machinery, Tools and Other Equipment
4.06      Several machine tools in the workshop are old and beyond repair.
These tools are required to make parts not available locally. A limited
amount of lathes, turret drills and planers will be replaced under the
Project.
4.07      The proposed Project will also include the provision of
mechanical handling equipment for containers at Antananarivo and for coal
at Vinanikarena near Antsirabe. A bulldozer, track tools and equipment
would be also provided to handle washouts and other emergencies.
(d) Telecommunications
4.08      The Moramanga-Lac Alaotra line links an important rice and
chromite producing region to major population centers and to Madagascar's
main seaport, Toamasina. The telecommunication system on this line cannot
be repaired because it is outdated and spare parts are no longer
available. While the need for replacement is well established, a least
cost solution is recommended. It will consist of two way radios and will
be developed in detail (para. 4.11) as an alternative to the expensive
underground cable recommended by an earlier study (para 3.06).
(e) Training
4.09      With assistance from France, RNCFM prepared a training program
for 1985-90 which was over-ambitious and was revised by the appraisal
mission to reflect more realistic objectives and target dates. A detailed
evaluation of RNCFM's past training achievements, and mission's
recommendations are presented in Annex 2.2. Briefly, this component would
consist of (i) construction of new training facilities; (ii) procurement of
teaching equipment; (iii) provision of 32 overseas fellowships for senior



- 22 -
and middle managers; and (iv) provision of 48 staff-montl- of technical
assistance for manpower planning, job analysis, and specific techniques.
The training component is aimed at improving staff productivity in the near
term.
(f) Technical Assistance
4.10      About 30 staff-months of technical assistance will be provided as
follows: (i) six staff-months to improve ballast production; (ii) eight
staff-months to improve train operations planning and coordination; (iii)
eight staff-months to strengthen planning and scheduling of workshop re-
pairs; and (iv) eight staff-months to demonstrate techniques to increase
the productivity of track rehabilitation. Details are shown in Annex 2.2.
(g) Studies
4.11      Several studies are included in the Project to help RNCFM and the
MTRT's planners in specific areas. They are: (i) 12 staff-months to
improve production of wood sleepers, including quality control, resources
management, sustainable yield, and financial viability (Annex 2.3); (ii) 10
staff-months for the detailed engineering for the cement plant terminal,
road and bridge link at Ibity (Annex 2.4); (iii) 8 staff-months to develop
the least cost solution to improve telecommunications on the NLA line
(Annex 2.1); and (iv) 10 staff-months to develop practical alternatives to
serve the transport needs to the Fianarantsoa-Manakara axis more
economicAlly than currently done (para. 1.21 and Annex 5.5) by rail.
(h) Cyclone Damage Repairs
4.12      In March 1986, an unusually fierce cyclone hit the Eastern coast
and in particular the TCE-line and the port of Toamasina. To provide for
i ediate urgently needed relief, funds were included both for RNCFK
repairs of damaged track, buildings and communications and for the port
authority, SEPT, for port facility repairs. Details could not be provided
at the time of negotiations, but preliminary assessments indicate an urgent
need for US$1.0 million each for RNCFM and SEPT, including contingencies.
D. Cost Estimates
4.13      The total project cost is estimated at FMG 11,027 million
(US$16.9 million) including contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is
estimated at FMG 7,782 million (US$12.0 million), or about 71% of total
project costs. The project cost summary is shown on the following page.

4.14      Cost estimates were prepared by engineering consultants financed
by IDA (Cr. 903-MAG), reviewed by the appraisal mission, and revised as
appropriate to reflect known costs for similar items. Base costs were
estimated in mid-1985 prices. Local taxes and duties were excluded from
the estimates because project expenditures would be exempted from them.
Physical contingencies were calculated at 10% of base costs except for
cyclone damage. Price escalation for foreign ane local costs is based on
projected increases in international US dollar prices of 7.5X p.a. in 1986,
and 8Z p.a. in 1987 and onwards. The inte;national rates have been also
used for local costs assuming that the difference between domestic and
international price inflation will be offset by adjustments in the foreign
exchange rate in accordance with Government policy.
4.15      Detailed engineering for the reconstruction of the bridge on the
TA line (para 4.04) was completed in June 1985. Detailed engineering for
the road bridge and cement terminal at Ibity has been financed under a PPF
advance. Project costs include approximately US$1.7 million equivalent for
about 155 staff-months of services by internat'onally recruited
specialists.
E. Financing
4.16      A preliminary financing plan is shown below:
Table 4.2 - Financing Plan
(million US$)       (Z)
IDA                              12.0             71.0
RNCFM                             4.8             28.4
SEPT                              0.1              0.6
Total                16.9           100.0
In addition to the above, CCCE has provided a loan to RNCFM of FF98 million
(US$14.0 million) to finance new locomotives and other equipment which are
economically justified (paras. 3.08 and 5.26).
4.17      An US$200,000 equivalent Project Preparation Facility Advance was
granted to MTRT to finance the study of the cement plant terminal and the
study of the Fianarantsoa-Manakara axis (para 4.11). The advance would be
refinanced from the proceeds of the IDA Credit. The Government would
onlend US$10.5 million to RNCFM on the following terms: (i) final maturity
of 14 years; (ii) four year drawdown period; (iii) two years grace; (iv)
repayment in 28 equal semiannual installments; (v) interest rate of 9.5%
p.a.; (vi) commitment fee of 0.75Z; and (vii) interest and principal
payment would be adjusted to reflect variations in the FMG/US$ exchange
rate. The Government will onlend US$1.0 million to SEPT on the same terms
as to RNCFM above. For the studies under the PPF (US$200,000) and the
cement plant road connection a total of US$500,000 will be provided by the
Government as a grant. A condition of effectiveness of the Credit
Agreement is that subsidiary loan agreements have been executed on behalf
of the Government and RNCFM and on behalf of the Government and SEPT,



- 25 -
incorporating the above terms and acceptable to IDA (para 7.02). It has
been agreed to provide funds retroactively up to a total of US$500,000 for
cyclone repair works after April 1, 1986. Since details could not be
provided at the time of negotiations, but only preliminary assessments of a
need for US$1.0 million each for RNCFM and SEPT, there would be a condition
of disbursement that a works program and execution arrangements have been
agreed with IDA for this part of the project (para 7.03).

4.19      Procurement of goods and services by RNCPM and SEPT would follow
Bank Group guidelines. RNCFM will carry out track relaying and repair
works by force account and will issue local tenders for the construr-tion of
the training center. Orders would be grouped whenever possible into
contracts valued at US$ 100,000 or more and would be procured through ICB
except for:
(i)  proprietary spares and supplies (US$1.4 million) which
would be procured by direct order; and
(ii) rail fastenings and miscellaneous equipment costing
less than US$ 100,000 and totalling no more than
US$ 1,000,000 would be procured by international and
local shopping based on comparing price quotations from
at least three manufacturers, dealers or suppliers.
Consultants would be selected in accordance with IDA guidelines. Their
terms of reference and conditions of employment would be satisfactory to
IDA.
G. Disbursements
4.20      Funds from the IDA Credit would be allocated as follows:

4.22      The above disbursement schedule is based on the implementation
schedule presented in Chart II. The disbursement profile for the Project
is faster than the standard profile for transportation projects as the
proposed Project is a rehabilitation project, the extent of civil works and
erection work involved is limited, and the implementation period for this
Project is considerably less than for a full scale conventional railway
project. The Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31,
1990.
H. Project Execution and Environment
4.23      RNCFM will be responsible for implementing the rail project and
SEPT for the port damage repairs. The track improvement will be carried
out by the railway's track and building department which has done similar
work under past projects, reinforced by technical assistance included in
the project to ensure the work proposed is accomplished with the available
funds. Rehabilitation and maintenance of locomotives and wagons will be
carried out in the railway's central workshops in Antananarivo strengthened
by technica'l assistance to improve the quality and quantity of work
produced. The project will have no adverse effect on the environment.
I. Operational Objectives
4.24      The project is oriented to track and locomotive improvements
which are the principal limiting factors to higher efficiency. With these
improvements the railway can concentrate on better operations by improving
wagon turn around and train scheduling. The proposed operational
objectives (Table 4.6) and Implementation Schedule (Chart II) were
discussed and agreed to during negotiations (para 7.01).

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General Objectives
5.01      Madagascar's railway has been, and is expected to remain, the
main transport mode for major sectors of the island's economy. Economic
production of rice and chromite ore, and distribution of grain and heavy
imported goods to the majority of the population is dependent upon rail
transport. Yet the railway's total traffic density is low compared to some
countries and is not expected to increase substantially due to increased
road competition for non-bulk commodities. The purpose of the proposed
Project, therefore, is to ensure that the railway remains operational and
capable of providing services essential to the economy at current traffic
levels. Toward that end, the project includes minimal track and rolling
stock investment. Emergency funds for RNCFM and SEPT will ensure
immdiately needed cyclone damage repairs but have not been evaluated in
the economic return calculations.
5.02      Without the Project, RNCFM's effective capacity and operating
efficiency would gradually deteriorate. Railway traffic would decline.
Service shortages would arise in the short term, which could cause serious
social and economic consequences, and higher cost road transport services
would replace relatively cheap rail service. The main economic benefits of
the project are derived from the maintenance of railway capacity at levels
tied to conservative economic assumptions and from the avoidance of
potential economic losses resulting from an otherwise gradual decline in
railway traffic.
B. Specific Project Objectives
5.03      The project is expected to correct deterioration on the transport
link between the chromite ore mines and rice growing region and the ports
and the populous central highlands; replace a bridge critical to continued
rail service between two cities on a different line; provide a rail link to
a new cement plant, likely to become a substantial source of rail traffic
over the long term; and improve operations and productivity in the areas of
equipment maintenance, track work and loading and unloading of containers.
Much of the operations improvement is tied to the purchase of spare parts,
tools, shop machinery, and large machinery such as a crane, bulldozer, fork
lift, and gang trolleys, that will assure more consistent availability of
motive power and substantially modernize very basic operations. External
financing will provide the foreign exchange necessary for these
acquisitions. The Project essentially continues rehabilitation and
operational imprr-vements begun in Railways I and II.
5.04      Studies, training and technical assistance included in the
Project will benefit staff in the short term and ensure that the new tools
and equipment are used efficiently. Studies to examine the railway's wood
sleeper production facility and the long term viability of the lesser used
southern portion of the railway aim to improve the availability of
resources for track maintenance over the long term.

C. Forecast of Future Traffic
Factors affecting traffic
5.05      The most fundamental factors underlying rail traffic levels are
the condition and projected growth rates for Madagascar's overall economy.
Madagascar's economy has actually declined since 1972 and rail traffic has
been stagnant. There is now evidence of economic recovery, however, and
both the Bank and the Government believe a 3rO-3.5% growth over the
1985-1988 period is achievable.
5.06      RNCFM has used the macro-economic growth estimates to forecast
rail traffic because regression analysis has shown good correlation in the
past. Assuming a 3Z (DP growth per year and applying the most conservative
of the models, freight traffic is forecast to grow 2.5-3.OZ p.a. and
passenger traffic 2.0-2.5Z p.a.
5.07      These levels are unlikely to be achieved, however, because
rail/road competition will begin to develop once the all weather road from
Toamasina on the coast to Moramanga is completed and because the passenger
market is evolving differently from the cargo market due to inherent
differences.
5.08      The degree to which rail traffic will continue to be lost to the
trucking industry is critical to the traffic forecasts. Analysis of the
issue shows that the railway will remain the most cost-effective mode for
certain commodities and lengths of haul for a long time, despite increased
road competition and provided operating conditions remain reasonable.
Depending upon the routes traveled and commodities in question, road
transport will be substantially more expensive than rail on a ton/kilometer
basis, even after the Antanarivo-Toamasina Road is opened for all weather
use. These results came from an assessment of the likely split in
road/rail freight traffic over time using 1984 tariff data as a base.
(Annex 5.1) Transport capacity and rail/truck modal split will be affected
by foreign exchange difficulties that limit imports and bring into play
political forces and other artificial constraints affecting the supply of
transport, equipment and spare parts.
5.09      Timing is also relevant to the traffic outlook.  Over the medium
term (5 years), intermodal competition will be limited due to the run down
condition of trucks, buses and mini-buses. Over the long term (10 years)
there is likelihood that thece constraints will be removed. In the short
term, therefore, constraints on rail capacity due to condition of the
infrastructure will limit traffic growth more than will intermodal
competition; in the longer term, however, traffic will be undoubtedly lost
to trucks, particularly short-haul and high valued manufactured imports.
Traffic Projections
5.10      Rail traffic projections for Madagascar, therefore, are better
made by summing up forecasts of individual commodities than by using
models to forecast total traffic from present levels. As indicated earlier,
most of RNCFM's traffic (and raison-d-etre) stems from commodities trans-



- 34 -
ported on the northern system between Lac Alaotra/Toamasina and the high-
lands of Madagascar. Indeed, the railroad has bad a neAr monopoly trans-
porting petroleum, many dry cargo imports, rice, grain and chromite over
these lines.
5.11      Table 5.1 shows past, present and projected levels of freight
traffic for the RNCFM's northern system. Commodities for which bulk handl-
ing facilities are already in use or where distances and/or commodity
nature clearly favors railway now and in the foreseeable future are petro-
leum products, rice, grain, chromite, coal and probably fertilizer.  These
commodities can be expected to account for about 210 million tonlk/  by
1990.
5.12      Commodities likely to be carried by the railway over the medlum,
but not necessarily the long term, include chemicals, construction
materials, paper and wood, vegetable oils and containers. Projections for
these commodities are expected to reach 36 million ton/km by 1990. Beyond
1990, continued rail transport of these commodities will depend on the
railway's ability to compete with truck (or air) service and cost.
5.13      Comnodities like meat, coffee and industrial goods, which by 1990
are projected at 36 million ton/km, will be even more vulnerable to
intermodal competition as they can be containerized.  RNCFI has made a good
start with container shipments (19,000 tons in 1984), but some of these
other commodities would be more efficiently moved by road.
5.14      All together, total tonnage is expected to reach 754,000 tons
vs. the 651,000 tons carried in 1984. Excluding the third group of comr-
modities, a more realistic approach given the vulnerability of the third
group to capture by the trucking industry, drops the total forecast. On a
ton/km basis the forecast used in the economic evaluation calls for 246
million ton/km to be carried on the RNCFK northern system compared to 220
million in 1984. The most likely forecast for 1990 is 282 million ton/km,
and may require additional rolling stock.
5.15      For passenger traffic, the outlook is far less optimistic.
Without change in the competitive situation, 1984 passenger levels could be
expected to increase from 188 million passenger/km to about 212 million
passenger/km in the RNCFM northern system. Once improvements on the
Moramanga to Toamasina road are completed, however, at least some 25
million passenger/km is expected to be diverted to road. Parts of the
Moramanga-Antananarivo road, however, remain in poor condition. At best,
therefore, passenger traffic in 1990 would equal 1984 levels as increases
due to economic growth are compensated for by losses in market share. A
more conservative evaluation, however, would assume further losses in
market share, particularly on other parts of the Antsirabe-Antananarivo-
Toamasina line, on the order of 15-20 million passenger/km (see Table 5.2).
Taking all these factors into account, the most likely forecast of
passenger traffic for the northern system by 1990, is about 170 million
passenger/km, with limited prospects for growth thereafter. The level.
achieved will naturally depend on the level of service offered by the
railway.



- 35 -
5.16      In suicary, the Bank's 1990 forecast calls for a three percent
increase in traffic units over 1984 to 440 million. RNCFM's forecast, by
contrast, is far greater since it essentially translates projected economic
growth into similar growth for railway traffic. Should a more optimistic
assumption prevail, investment in motive power and rolling stock would have
to be increased to meet the increased demand.
D. Economic Return Of Project Components
5.17      This Project consists of rail improvemc.ts necessary to handle
the most conservatively derived estimates of traffic over the short term.
The project has been divided into four main components, each of which has
been subjected to a separate cost-benefit analysis: (1) track improvements
on the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra (MIA) line, (2) investments to provide a rail
spur to bring raw materials close to a new cement plant close to Antsirabe,
(3) construction of a new bridge and related improvements on the Antsirabe
(TA) line, and (4) investments in maintenance equipment (mainly spares,
shop machinery and tools).
5.18      For each component, benefits from the railway investment have
been compared to the most likely alternatives. Assumptions used in the
economic calculations are detailed in Annex 5.2. As mentioned earlier, the
only transport alternative to the railway for all the northerc system is
the road between Toamasina and Antananarivo (RN2) and Antsirabe (RN7).
Part of this road is now being replaced by a new road between the coast
(Brickaville) and Moramanga. The RN7 is being partially rehabilitated
under the Sixth Highway Project with AfDB financing. From Moramanga the
rice and chromite producing area of Lac Alaotrs is connected by an earth
road.
Moramanga - Lac Alaotra Line
5.19      The first project component involves renewal of track art
communications on the northern system's spur line from Moramanga to Lac
Alaotra. The Bank's second Madagascar railway project included some 160 km
of track renewal and 123 km of improvements on the northern system but
implementation was delayed due to difficulties in producing ballast and
sleepers. The Second Railway Project, therefore, concentrated ent,-ely
upon renewing the main TCE line; no rehabilitation work has been undertaken
on the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra (MLA) line until very recently. Railr left
over from the Second Railway Project are available for renewing the MLA
line. Ties are not available, however, since production of wood sleepers
in Madagascar has been slow, partly due to ecological consequences of
deforestation. The cost of the project is thus less than it would
otherwise be.
5.20      Moreover, this rail line is an important adjunct to the main line
between the coast and the capital. Ihe Lac Alaotra region supplies home
grown rice to the highland population and chromite ore for export. Yet the
present condition of the rail line is poor and has led to deterioration in
train service. As a consequence, home-grown rice shipments to Antananarivo
are being replaced with imported rice and chrome exports have dropped. The
parallel earth road is passable only in the dry season and is not capable
of handling the quantities or type of freight involved.



- 36 -
5.21       The poor condition of the rail-line is aggravated by an obsolete
and unreliable system of telecoomunications.  Low speeds, speed restric-
tions and derailments are the main causes for long wagon turnaround times
and for capacity problems that have hampered shipments of both rice and
chrome. Capacity is a particular problem since the seasonality of these
comnodities coincide.
5.22       The project benefits include maintenance cost savings, the
avoided cost of purchasing additional wagons to meet demand for chromite
transport and the additional road transport costs for rice shipments that
would otherwise be carried by rail. The best estimate of this Project's
economic return, is 15Z. Using an opportunity cost of capital of 12Z, the
first year return is 14%.  Details are shown in Table 5.3.
Rail Spur to Ibity Cement Plant
5.23      The new cement plant at Ibity will use coal as a raw material.
Coal and any other raw materials needed by the plant can be transported to
Ibity most cheaply if the coal is sent by ship to Tosmasina and then by
rail to Antsirabe and on to Ibity. To bring the coal to the plant, a
simple rail terminal and some handling equipment is needed; initially,
additional rolling stock is not. By 1990, however, more rolling stock may
be necessary to serve the plant given the railway's projected capacity
constraints. Purchase of one locomotive and 20 wagons, therefore, has been
iucluded as a cost of this operation. Including these costs, road
upgrading as well as the costs of a road bridge between the rail head and
the cement plant and any incremental operating costs incurred by RNCFM, the
project's financial return to the railway has been estimated to be 14%.
The economic alternative against which this project is measired is not to
build the spur and carrying the traffic by road. The economic benefits are
thus calculated by weighing future coal road transport cost against the
cost of servicing the cement plant by rail. The economic return is fore-
cast at 17%. Details are shown in Table 5.3.
Bridge Construction on the Antsirabe Line
5.24      The line from Antananarivo to Antsirabe (TA) is generally in good
condition with the exception of cne bridge close to Antananarivo. Repaired
and shored up several times, this 60-year old bridge is on the verge of
tot-al collapse. Cost of replacing the bridge must be weighed against t'he
loss of traffic from closing the line. At present, this section of the
line returns a positive net financial contribution to RNCFN so the invest-
ment could be justified without detailed analysis. For the specific case
evaluation made however, benefits of continued operation have been _.cmpared
to the cost of the bridge, three locomotives and operating costs
assignable to this project. On this basis the financial return is
estimated to be of 15%. Details are shown in Table 5.3.
Investment in Equipment Maintenance Tools
5.25      Spares, shop machinery and too: s all are required to maintain the
fleet of locomotives, railcars and wagons. Madagascar's limited foreign
exchange has prevented normal replacement of such items and left the



- 37 -
railroad virtually bereft of spare parts. Included in the Project,
therefore, is about two years worth of necessary spares and minor
maintenance equipment. Without these, the fleet, particularly locomotives,
would rapidly deteriorate and available units would decrease. Eventually
the railway would either have to buy more locomotives or curtail services.
For evaluation purposes, it has been assumed that more locomotives would be
purchased before services were curtailed. Specifically, it was assumed
that without spares, locomotives would gradually go out of service at the
rate of about one a year. Avoiding this gradual loss of the three oldest
locomotives is then assumed to be the main benefit of this project
component. On this basis the economic rate of return of this component is
estimated to be 25%. If traffic is diverted from rail to road as a
consequence of the locomotive's going out-of-service, the economic return
would be even higher. For details see Table 5.3 and Annex 5.1.
Overall Project
5.26      The overall economic rate of return for the project is calculated
at 16Z. The calculation assumes a project life of 10 years and that
traffic will not increase after 1990. Without the proposed investments,
RNCFH's effective capacity and operating efficiency will be gradually
eroded. The potential effect on traffic under these conditions over the
1985-1988 period has been estimated as a decline in traffic units from 408
million in 1984 to 250 million in 1990 for the Northern line. The main
reason for the loss of traffic is a gradual loss in available motive power
and an increase in derailments and other operational difficulties.
5.27      Including the incremental costs of carrying this traffic by road
instead of rail, the overall economic rate of return of RNCFM's Investment
Plan (para 3.08) is also about 16% over 10 years. This calculation
includes all investments planned by RNCFM in the 1985-1988 period, training
and technical assistance, as well as o - .;r capital items CCCE has already
agreed to finance.
E. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
5.28      The four main quantifiable risks of the project are that:  (1)
the project execution would not materialize as planned; costs would be
higher and implementation delays would be incurred; (2) traffic levels
would be significantly greater or lower than expected; (3) estimates of
rail/truck modal distribution that underlie the traffic forecasts could be
substantially different from projections; and (4) unforeseen operational
disruptions could occur.

5.29      If traffic is less than anticipated the economics of the project
will be less than expected but not seriously jeopardized. Sensitivity
analyses (see Annex 5.4) indicate that traffic volumes can be 20% below
forecasts before the railroad reaches a break-even point on the
investments. Traffic is unlikely to be much lower than forecast, however;
projections were purposely kept on the conservative side and revenues do
not include any funds from marginal businesses. Moreover, lower volumes
will be offset by lower costs of carrying traffic and, if conditions
warrant, by stringent cost cutting measures. In this case too, the
relatively short nature of the investments and the flexibility within the
project itself mean that the investment levels could be modified given
changes in economic conditions.
5.30      If traffic is greater than anticipated, equipment capacity
constraints may be reached sooner than expected and there will be a need to
purchase additional rolling stock to carry traffic that cannot otherwise be
shipped by trucks. Madagascar's overall economy is beginning to recover
from over a decade of negative growth and recovery could be faster than
expected. Moreover, present traffic levels are abnormally low especially
for products such as petroleum and construction materials which must be
imported. If growth is substantially greater, the railway has some
flexibility to expand capacity by operating more intensively, improving
turnaround times by presviing loading and unloading facilities, and by
employing other such extraordinary measure. Moreover, given the short term
nature of the Project and the fact that significant shifts in traffic
levels are easily detected, the RNCFM could plan for additional rolling
stock purchases in 1988 and 1989.
5.31      Traffic forecasts are sensitive to forecasts of future rail/truck
fares and related modal splits. The fare levels for rail and truck assumed
in the project, and more importantly, the relative difference between the
two, err on the side of diverting traffic to the trucking industry.
Indeed, the forecast assumes that the railway dill lose most traffic that
typically is more easily carried by truck, as quickly as truck capacity is
able to carry it. The commodities included in the rail forecast,
therefore, are essentially bulk commodities for which the rail/truck
pricing differential is extremely high. It is unlikely, therefore, that
intermodal competition will significantly lower the rail fares or rail
volumes assumed in the projections (Annex 5.1). Fair intermodal
competition is also the aim of policy reforms being promoted by the
Government and Bank as part of the Sixth Highway Project.
5.32      Operational risks also could alter the project's projected
returns. Madagascar's climate is hard on its transportation
infrastructure; heavy rains and frequent cyclones often render roads and
rail lines impasbdr,le for days at a time. An extension of historic levels,
the projections reflect a normal level of derailments and disruption.
In the event a calamity of extraordinary prs>ortions occured, however, the
railway is likely to resume operation more rapidly than the road. The
plant rehabilitation work being undertaken now and as part of the Project
should lessen the degree of erosion that normally occurs with the rains.



- 42 -
5.33      Risks that the project will cost more than anticipated or that
components cannot be obtained are fairly minimal because of the nature of
the project. Only a few project elements are sensitive to changes in
procurement, execution or works or available financing. For the MLA line
rehabilitation, the main source of potential cost increase is an increase
in the price of imported steel sleepers. New rail for the project has
a! eady been purchased and is in Madagascar awaiting installation.
Procurement of shop equipment, tools, spare parts for machinery, and
rolling stock are also subject to changes in price and to currency
realignment but the program is flexible and the items to be purchased are
common, easily available, and unlikely to incur drastic price increases in
the near future. The bridges and other civil works will not be undertaken
until detailed engineering specifications have been completed Which will
help keep the negotiated price and completion dates within reason. In sum,
the Project does not have any major risks of delay or cost overruns.
5.34      In fact, major risks of any sort seem unlikely.  The project was
designed after careful review of RNCFM's overall investment plan and long
term future. Track renewal targets and equipment acquisitions represent
the minimal investment necessary to maintain operations without further
deterioration. The economic returns from projected improvement in RNCFK's
plant and equipment maintenance capability and locomotive availability are
measured as narrowly as possible against alternative investments. The real
overall economic return could prove higher since the project protects the
sunk investment in the Railway and preserves an important section of
Madagascar's transportation sector.
F. Other Risks: Uneconomic Lines and Services
5.35      The southern line between Fianarantsoa-Mauakara (FCE) presently
operates at a loss, cannot attract sufficient traffic to be viable, and
will continue to be a drain on the railway's finances (para 1.21).
Consultants recommended closure as soon as roads serving essentially the
same area are improved, but the implementation of these recommendations is
expected to take a long time. To lessen this risk, the Government would
subsidize losses incurred as a result of keeping the line open until
adequate road links are available.
5.36      Continuation of passenger service may also represent an economic
risk. As road travel becomes faster and more reliable, RNCFK's passenger
service, particularly its commuter trains, may prove uneconomic. At
present RNCFM serves 86 station. and a large number of other stops near
large towns. Many of these stops exist to serve commuters that ultimately
may be better served by buses or pickup trucks outfitted with benches. Any
decision to downgrade or eliminate passenger service would be premature,
however, until cost and revenue data by type of service can be collected
and analyzed.

VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past Performance
6.01      In June 1982, heeding to mounting pressure from donors 1/, the
Government set up an ad-hoc Commission to prepare a financial recovery plan
for RNCFM. The seriousness of the situation and the effectiveness of the
remedies are highlighted in the following table:
Table 6.1 - RNCFM - Financial Highlights

Receivables (days on hand)             200    292      153     101       66
6.02      The Commission increased the freedom of RNCFM's management in two
key area: pricing and receivable collection. As a result, despite
stagnating traffic, revenues increased th-reefold between 1980 and 1984 and
RNCF generated a healthy cash flow of RMG 5.9 billion (US$9.1 million) in
1984. Cash flow generation and prompter payment of bills by Government
agencies greatly improved RNCPM's liquidity.  Details are shown in Annexes
6.1-6.4.
6.03      In addition to the significant improvements in financial
management described above, RNCFM's management has made tangible progress
in the areas of planning and costing. The preparation of the current
investment plan was an important achievement. Though it benefited from
outside assistance, RNCFM's staff learned much from the exercise and it has
acquired an useful capital budgeting capacity. Human resources plai ning is
another area of recenc institutional improvements. In October 1984, RNCFM
organized a human resources division. Staff of this new division
participated in the preparation of the training program included in the
proposed project (Annex 2.2). Analytical cost accounting systems have been
introduced during the Second Railways Project. The introduction is
expected to enable RNCFM to improve its tariff structure and to orient its
marketing strateg;. At appraisal, RNCFH agreed to set up a marketing unit
to improve its relations with its clients.
1/ Tie Bank suspended disbursements of credit 903-MAG between March
and October 1982 because RNCFH was in violation of a revenue covenant
in the Credit Agreement.

B. Financial Objectives
6.06      RNCFM's financial objectives for the next Plan period are: (i) to
continue the program of financial recovery; (ii) to improve its tariff
structure; and (iii) to reorient its marketing strategy. While the
financial recovery program has already been largely successful, the
positive achievement of the last three years must be consolidated and
protected. In order to do so, the Bank and other external aid agencies
must keep the pressure on Government to increase RNCFM's financial and
management autonomy. This is an important feature of our involvement in
the subsector.
0.05      Improvement of RNCFM's tariff structure is going to be made
possible thanks to the introduction under Railways II of analytical cost
accounting systems which are enabling RNCFM to price each service above
its avoidable cost. The avoidable cost of a service is defined as any and
all costs the railways would not incur if it did not provide auch service.
In an increasingly competitive environment, tariffs should not be adjusted
automatically to pass on cost increases to customers. Rather a program of
cost containment is being adopted to enable RNCFM to reduce freight tariffs
in real terms over time.
6.06      Finally, RNCFM is beginning to realize that the mobilization of
its resources as well as its pricing should be market driven and is setting
-ap a marketing unit to reorient its market strategy accordingly.
C. Financial Forecasts
Assumptions
6.07      Financial forecasts have been prepared for RNCFM. These fore-
casts are based on the assumptions given in Annex 6.5 and are based on
RNCFM's actual performance coefficients, projected traffic and inflation,
and the financial objectives discussed above.
6.08      Between 1985 and 1989, freight tariffs are projected to fall 18%
in real terms to reflect a changing pattern of traffic and increased road
competition, while passenger tariffs are projected to increase by about
27%, also in real terms, to reflect the notion that freight and passenger
traffic should make equivalent contributions to corporate overhead. Total
payroll is projected to increase at a rate 2% lower than the projected rate
of inflation to reflect RNCFM's commitment at appraisal that retiring and
otherwise terminated staff would not be automatically replaced.

6.10      The above tab'  shows that, based on the above assumption which
are believed to be reasonable, RNCFM would achieve its financial
objectives. RNCFM would carry an annual traffic of about 440 million
units, pass on all cost increases while reducing freight tariffs slightly
in real terms, generate sufficient cash-flow to finance the local currency
portion of its Investment Plan, and service its debt. RNCFM's financial
condition will remain satisfactory.

D. Financial Covenants
6.11      During the last two years, RNCFM has demonstrated that it can
achieve satisfactory financial performance. The above financial forecast
is realistic provided that Government continues to grant RNCFM sufficient
autonomy and that the railway exercises good business judgment in managing
its affairs. The Bank has played an active role in persuading Government
to grant greater autonomy to RNCFM and it has a responsibility to ensure
that this process is consolidated.
6.12      To monitor RNCFM's financial performance during the project
period the following financial covenants are proposed: (i) each railway
service would be priced at or above its avoidable cost; (ii) service would
be provided only to customers whose receivables are aged 60 days or less;
(iii) the working ratio would be kept at 65% or less; (iv) the net return
on fixed assets revalued annuallyl/ would be at least 3% p.a.; (v) the debt
to equity ratio would be no higher than 55%; and (vi) the current ratio
would be at least 2.5:1.
6.13      RNCFM's accounts are audited by an independent accounting firm
acceptable to the Bank. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that
RNCFM would submit annual audit reports to the Bank within six months of
the end of each fiscal year. The audit report would include a statement of
compliance with the above covenants.
1/ Madagascar legislation does not allow a company to revalue its assets
in its published financial statements. RNCFM's external auditors have
stated that the railway's financial statements currently reflect the
fair market value of its fixed assets. For purposes of complying with
the proposed covenant, the net book value carried on the balance sheet
will be adjusted according to estimates prepared by consulting
engineers financed by France and acceptable to the Bank.

VII. RECOMHENDATIONS
7.01      At negotiations, the following matters were discussed and
agreement reached:
(a) Deregulation of transport (para 1.11);
(b) Submission by the Government of a satisfactory action plan
concerning the FCE line (para. 1.21).
(c)  that RNCFM would not undertake any investments which are not
included in the Investment Plan without prior consultation
with the Bank on the economic justification of such
investments (para 3.08);
(d) Project Implementation Schedule (para 4.23); and
(e) Operational Objectives (para 4.23).
(f) the proposed financial covenants (para. 6.12).
7.02      Execution of Subsidiary Loan Agreements for RNCFM and SEPT
satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness (para
4.17).
7.03      There would be a condition of disbursement for the cyclone repair
component of the project that a works program and execution arrangements
have been agreed with IDA for this part of the project (para. 4.17).
7.04      Subject to the above conditions, the Project would be suitable
for a Credit to Madagascar of US$12.0 million equivalent on standard IDA
terms.
