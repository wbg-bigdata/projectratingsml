INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of the Republic of Zambia and Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines, Limited (ZCCM) have requested a Bank loan of US$75 million
equivalent to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of a US$300 million
program to rehabilitate ZCCM's facilities and to rationalize its operations.
This rehabilitation program is crucial to reestablish ZCCM's competitiveness
on the world market and to ensure ZCCM's future financial viability. It is
also vital for a stable development of the Zambian economy, since the mining
industry accounts for over 30% of Zambia's GDP and around 95% of its foreign
exchange earnings, and is Zambia's major employer. As such, the Government is
dependent on copper revenues to finance its investment programs to develop
other sectors of the national economy and to diversify the country's economic
base. The proposed loan would be the first by the Bank to the Zambian mining
sector. 1/
1.02     The proposed Project addresses the technical, management and human
resource problems which, in conjunction with recent depressed copper prices,
have undermined the technical efficiency and the financial position of the
Company. The Project is comprised of three components: (i) a replacement and
rehabilitation program for high-priority equipment and spares to rehabilitate
ZCCM's existing mine and plant facilities, (ii) a training program to upgrade
skills of the local technical and supervisory workforce; and (iii) technical
studies with the aim of reviewing economically justified capacity and
production levels and rationalizing ZCCM's operations.
1.03     Following a mining sector survey in October 1980, the Project was
first identified in August, 1981, and was appraised in February 1982, by
Messrs. P. Lietard (Mission leader), A. Leon, R. H. Lloyd, J. Strongman, and
C. N. Ahmad, of the Industry Department; L. Swahn, of the Education Department
(EDC); and M. Stoakes (Consultant). A post appraisal mission comprised of
Messrs. Lietard, Lloyd and Stoakes visited Zambia in March, 1983 and was
joined by a team of the African Development Bank. Contact was also maintained
during the appraisal and post-appraisal with representatives of the European
Economic Community in Brussels and Lusaka.
II. THE ZAMBIAN MINING SECTOR
A. Role of the Mining Sector in the Economy
2.01     The mining sector has been the dominant influence in Zambia's
economic development, contributing consistently over 30% of its gross domestic
1/  The IFC has participated in two ZCCM (formerly NCCM)-sponsored projects,
i.e., the Cobalt project (US$20 million investment, Report IFC/P-354,
1979); and the NCCM Tailing Leach Stage 3 project (DM 70 million
investment, Report IFC/P-462, 1981).

product (GDP) 1/, and around 95% of its foreign exchange earnings. It is the
second largest employer after the Government, with about 57,300 salaried
people, or 16% of Zambia's total paid employmnent. Of all minerals produced in
the country, copper is by far the most important, accounting for about 90% of
Zambia's total mineral export value.
2.02     Zambia's mineral production, with the exception of cobalt, has
declined since 1974, as shown in the following table, but none with such
overall economic impact as copper, which has decreased in total volume
produced by 18% between 1974 and 1982.

Sources: Zambia Mineral Yearbooks, 1974-81.
ZCCM Annual Reports, 1982-83.
2.03     Declining production has been exacerbated by depressed mineral
prices.  Copper price declined 38% in real terms between 1974 and 1982, and
the 3-month average copper price at mid-1982 was about 60 cents/lb and
touched as low as 50 cents/lb in June 1982. In 1983, copper production
accounted for 88% of the total value of Zambian mineral production (followed
by cobalt at 7%, lead and zinc together at 3%, and coal at 2%). Since the
mid-1970s, the mining industry has become increasingly less able to sustain
itself financially; and its contribution in direct (mineral and export) taxes
to government revenues, which averaged K 170 million (US$140 million) per
year during 1965-74, was marginal in 1975 and 1976 and has been nil every
year since then, except in 1980 when it reached K 75 million (US$63
million). In April 1983, a tax on mineral exports (4% of export value,
increased to 8% in August 1983) was introduced to provide a new source of
mineral revenue to the Government; until then, mineral taxes were levied
solely on the basis of profit.
2.04     Largely because of the importance of the mining sector in Zambia's
economy, the country has, as a result, experienced consecutive years of

15% of GDP due to lower copper prices since 1975.

economic and financial hardship, affecting most seriously government finances
and the balance of payment. Real GDP stagnated between 1974 and 1978, and
declined by 10% in 1979; growth has averaged about 2% per annum since then.
Real GNP per capita (US$560 in 1980) is 25% below that in 1974 and 50% less
than in 1965. The balance of payments has been in chronic disequilibrium
since 1975, with current account deficits averaging 8-10% of GDP; deficit
financing has absorbed a large share of net domestic credit and contributed
to a sharp rise in domestic prices, averaging 20% per annum during 1976-78
and 12% per annum during 1979-81.
B. Mineral Resources and Reserves
2.05      Zambia has an area of 752,000 km2 (Map IBRD 17004) and has been
relatively well prospected over a long period of time. Over 600 mineral
occurrences and some 45 minerals or metals have been identified. Most of the
country is part of the great plateau of South-Eastern Africa at an average
elevation of some 1,200 meters above sea level.
2.06      In its north-central part, Zambia has one of the richest metal
provinces in the world. The copper-cobalt mines are linked geologically to
those in the Shaba province of Zaire both being part of the same copperbelt
which is 500 km long and 300 km wide and extends from Kolwezi in Zaire to
Luanshya in Zambia (Map IBRD 16492). The important copper and cobalt
deposits occur in layers of sedimentary rock and form sheet-like bodies 5-20
meter thick which have been considerably bent and twisted by geological
forces over the long period since they were formed. Unlike the porphyry
copper deposits of North and South America and of the Pacific which originate
from the action of hot fluids from deep in the earth and generally average
about 1% or less copper, copper in Zambia and Zaire was deposited in basins
by water together with particles of sands and clay; and the deposits average
3% copper in Zambia and 4% copper in Zaire.
2.07      The Copperbelt, together with the neighboring copper-cobalt
producing Shaba province of Zaire, forms one of the world's greatest
metallogenic provinces and the two countries' copper resources 1/ rank third
in the world, after the USA and Chile. Of the estimated 1,100 million tonnes
of copper deposits on land, Zambia and Zaire have 131 million tonnes or some
12%, with Zambia itself having an estimated 58 million tonnes, or 5% of the
world's total. In addition, the Zambian/Zairian copperbelt contains by far
the greatest known resources of cobalt: of an estimated 9.9 million tonnes
of cobalt metal resources in deposits on land, Zaire has a larger share with
some 3.1 million tonnes, or 31%, followed by Zambia with 1.7 million tonnes,
or 17% of the world's total.
2.08      The deposits of the Zambian Copperbelt were first exploited only in
the early 1930's, when in 1931 Roan Antelope (Luanshya) commenced
production. Production was intermittent, while the intensity of exploration,
both on the Copperbelt and elsewhere in the country, was gradually building
up under the concession companies, most notably those controlled by the
Anglo-American Group of South Africa and Roan Selection Trust of the United
1/ Geological resources are defined as mineral occurrences which have or may
acquire some economic value in the future.

about 3% copper, corresponding to about 15 million tonnes of copper and
327,000 tonnes of cobalt, as shown in the following table.

ore resources, grading 2% copper, are indicated or inferred in the Copperbelt
itself.
2.09     Most of the larger deposits which now form the nucleus of the mining
industry in Zambia were found between 1899 and 1923, long before organized
prospecting was initiated. Despite strenuous efforts over several decades,
geological prospection produced a comparatively small inventory of additional
metal, although the coverage given to the areas held under concessions has
been sufficiently comprehensive within the limits of the available technology
not to have missed any large deposits or major new mining areas. For
example, although more than 600 additional mineral deposits were recorded by
systematic work between 1924 and 1928, except for Konkola and Chibuluma, none
were turned into mines of any consequence. This includes ground in the west
of the Copperbelt in which the Kalengwa and Lumwana copper deposits were
subsequently detected geochemically. It is also inevitable that odds are
decreasing that additional investments will yield commensurate results
because all relatively cheap and quick methods of exploration have been
tried. With no major technical breakthrough in sight, most future
discoveries will have to depend largely on expensive drilling, and the
probability of discoveries is decreasing in view of the already thorough
coverage given to the country.
2.10     While copper and cobalt are by far Zambia's major mineral resources,
there are also important lead-zinc deposits at Kabwe. In addition, coal
mining at Maanba was started after the Unilateral Declaration of Independence
in 1965 from the then Rhodesia. The Maamba Colliery is now producing the
majority of the country's coal requirements and IDA approved in March 1983 a

US$4.3 million engineering credit for that mine. 1/ There are good-quality
amethysts and emeralds which are being exploited by small-scale companies and
artisans. Developments in the field of industrial minerals have been most
successful, particularly in limestone for cement, lime and pyrite for the
smelters at the Copperbelt, clays for brick and claywares, and sand for glass
manufacture. In addition, there are deposits of fluorspar and feldspar and
small tin deposits being worked in the southern part of the country.
Finally, exploration efforts are now being directed towards finding liquid or
gaseous hydrocarbons. 2/
2.11     Although there are probably few large mineral resources outside the
Copperbelt, there are smaller occurrences which could justify a continuing
exploration effort, such as in phosphate rock in the western provinces, in
gold, in uranium, which occurs in the same sedimentary rock as the Zambezi
valley coal deposits, and in diamonds since many occurrences of kimberlite
(host rock for diamonds) have been located.
C. Structure of the Sector
2.12     The history of mining in Zambia is largely that of copper.  Copper
has been extracted from surface deposits for centuries by Zambian small-scale
miners, but it was only during the 1930s that important rich copper deposits
were mined with new technologies, that production was raised, and that Zambia
became one of the world's leading copper producers. Total production
increased from 6,400 tonnes to 145,000 tonnes from 1930 to 1935, reaching
644,000 tonnes in 1964, the year Zambia became independent.
2.13     In 1969, the copper mining industry was partially nationalized, with
the Government purchasing a controlling 51% of the outstanding shares. The
industry was then consolidated into two groups. Operations of the
Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa formed Nchanga Consolidated Copper
Mines Limited (NCCM), while t'ne operations owned by Roan Selection Trust
International, Inc. of the UK (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the AMAX
Corporation of the USA) became Roan Consolidated Mines Limited (RCM). The
Government formed a holding company, the Zambia Industrial Mining Corporation
Limited (ZIMCO), which then held the Government's 51% share in both NCCM and
RCM. To finance the purchase, ZIMCO issued bonds at 6% per annum, payable in
1978 for RCM and in 1982 for NCCM, for a total acquisition cost of about
US$331 million. Anglo-American Corporation and Roan Selection Trust
continued management of their respective companies until 1974 when the
Government, having redeemed all the outstanding ZIMCO bonds, terminated their
management and marketing contracts for a lump sum of US$79 million, and both
RCM and NCCM became self-managing.
2.14     Copper production in Zambia peaked in 1976 with a total output of
712,000 tonnes, representing about 11% of total world copper production. As
the financial conditions of both companies then began to deteriorate, and the
need for more equity became apparent, the Government discussed with AMAX and

Anglo their willingness to inject new funds into the companies. Since
neither was willing to provide more equity, the Government agreed to convert
portions of its outstanding loans to NCCM and RCM into equity. As result, in
1979 the Government increased its shareholding, in NCCM and RCM to 60% and
61%, respectively. Finally, in May 1981, the Government announced the merger
of RCM and NCCM into a new company to be known as Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines Limited (ZCCM). The merger documents were signed in March 1982, with
retroactive effect to April 1981. Following clhe merger, ZIMCO remains the
major shareholder of ZCCM with 60.3% of the shares, the other shareholders
being Zambia Copper Investments, a Bermuda-based company controlled by
Anglo-American (27.3%), Roan Selection Trust (6.9%), and public shareholders
in the USA (4.2%) and in the UK (1.3%). A complete presentation of ZCCM's
activities is made in Chapter III.
2.15     ZIMCO was originally established to Look after the Government's
mining interests. Its role has been expanded since then, and as of March 31,
1983, the state-owned holding company had total assets of about US$515
million and about 100 subsidiaries operating in the mining, industrial, and
agricultural sectors, as well as in trading, hotels, transport, energy, and
financial services. Foreign companies are minority shareholders in many of
ZIMCO's subsidiaries, such as ZCCM, and do nol: have control over the
management of their operations. While represented at the Board of ZCCM,
ZIMCO lost the chairmanship which it held in NCCM and RCM when ZCCM was
created. The Chairman and Chief Executive Ofi-icer of ZCCM is de facto
nominated directly by the President, which has considerably weakened ZIMCO's
influence on ZCCM's policies and strategies.
2.16     The capacity of the mining companies to meet financing requirements
is to a large extent controlled by policies and practices established by the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Zambia. Effective taxation rates on
copper production are high reaching 79% through a dual imposition of a 51%
mineral tax on profits and a 45% incorne tax on profits (after mineral tax)
plus an 8% royalty on sales receipt. Effective taxation on cobalt, lead and
zinc revenues is also a high 56%, comprising a 20% mineral tax and 45% income
tax on profits. These rates, among the highest in the world, have provided
little financial incentive to the companies to invest and expand production.
In general, the lack of coordination on mineral policy, development and
financing have seriously hampered the rationaL development of the Zambian
mining industry.
D. Prospects of the Copper Sector
2.17     Problems and prospects of the mining sector are basically those of
the copper sector; first, because copper represents 90% of the value of all
minerals produced in Zambia, and second, because the production of other
minerals such as cobalt and coal, are closely associated with the production
and refining of copper.
2.18     The copper industry is confronted with various constraints that were
analyzed in the Bank's Basic Economic Report (No. 1586b-ZA, of October 3,
1977). Basically, these mining activities have reached their full maturity,
and all deposits are becoming less rich and less accessible, leading to
increased real costs of production. Over the next 20 years, the context in
which the sector will have to operate is a combination of average copper
grades declining from 3% to 2%, depletion of certain deposits, scarcity of
foreign exchange, shortage of skilled personnel, and unreliability of the



- 7 -
transportation network. The effects are being felt most intensely at a time
when copper prices are particularly low, and as a result ZCCM is incurring
large financial losses.
2.19     Ore grades during the initial decades of the copper industry in
Zambia were extremely high: for example, Chingola ore was 5-6% copper during
the 1940s and 1950s, while it is about 3% at present and Nkana ore was about
5% copper in the 1930s and is only about 2% at present. As mentioned (para.
2.08), the known geological reserves of the Copperbelt are estimated at 497
million tonnes, containing an average of 3.10% copper, representing 15
million tonnes of copper. Recovery of finished copper from this reserve at
the mines (about 73%) and the metallurgical plants (about 85%), is 63%
overall, representing about 10 million tonnes of copper metal.
2.20     Fully or partially developed reserves represent about three years of
production at the present production rate, and the tonnages quoted for
undeveloped reserves represent an additional 14 years of production. This
tonnage is small if compared with similar figures for other copper-producing
countries. For example, a similar number for Zaire is on the order of 50
years. Although there are large additional indicated resources, difficult
geological conditions--including strongly folded, deep ore bodies of varying
thickness, large underground volumes of water, complex ores and rising costs
of production--may make exploitation of the greater portion of those
resources uneconomic. For example, 200 million tonnes of ore are indicated
and possible at Konkola, with an average grade of 3.7% copper, but a copper
price about double the present price (in real terms) would be required for
them to be economically exploitable. Another example is Nchanga: resource
tonnages include those at depths below the Nchanga open pit which may prove
uneconomic to mine; and, despite Nchanga's high-grade ore (3.2%) and the
largest total estimated reserves in the Copperbelt (270 million tonnes),
Nchanga mine production is already expected to decline over the next decade.
2.21     Exploration activities by ZCCM indicate that while small orebodies
exist which could be mined economically at current or foreseeable copper
prices, there are no known economic deposits in the Copperbelt vast enough to
replace the largely declining production that will take place in the 1990s.
2.22     In this context, it is important that the Government decide the role
the copper industry should play in its macroeconomic plans for the next
decade, first, because the geology, mining conditions and resulting mining
cast will force a considerable drop in copper production around the year 2000
thereby necessitating the development of alternate sources of income for
Zambia in the 21st century; and, second, because even decreasing production
levels in the medium to long term will require investing substantial
technical, human and financial resources that are also needed for any
credible diversification program. 'While it is generally accepted that Zambia
will have to diversify its economic base in preparation for its post-copper
era economy, the decision making and planning process will take time as
long-term objectives and short-term requirements, particularly foreign
exchange needs and employment considerations, will have to be weighed against
each other.
2.23     For ZCCM, however, the need to receive clear directives from the
Government on what is expected from the mining industry is more urgent. For
example, it has operated in recent past with the assumed objective of
maximizing production, which may or may not have maximized foreign exchange



- 8 -
earnings to Zambia; but, with economic conditions of production receiving
only secondary consideration, the impact on ZCCM's financial standing has
been quite damaging and has already jeopardized the Company's ability to
sustain its activities without massive Government assistance. In order to
establish comprehensive strategies over the coming decade, ZCCM has received
directives from the Government, its majority shareholder, giving primary
consideration to profitability and economic efficiency. Such directives were
endorsed by ZCCM's Board in February 1984. They imply closing of
uneconomical operations and permanent or temporary release of some labor,
with their far-reaching social consequences; the priority allocation of
foreign exchange to sustain ZCCM operations; the determination of an adequate
taxation regime and dividend policy to permit a sound financial structure for
the Company; and possibly a reduction in the levels of production. Chapter
III discusses how ZCCM will in turn translate such directives into specific
strategies and action plans.
III.  THE COMPANY.
3.01     Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited (ZCCM) was established in
March 1982 through the merger of NCCM and RCM (paras. 2.13-2.14) with an
authorized share capital of K 900 million (US$563 million). The ownership
structure of the Zambian copper industry before and after the merger is
presented in Annex 3-1. The Company has eleven affiliates, as detailed in
Annex 3-2, which have a combined share capital of K 30 million (US$19
million). Ten of the affiliates provide products (power, lime, timber) and
services (air transport, exploration, engineering, personnel and management
advice, property maintenance, personnel recruitment) to the mining industry.
The eleventh affiliate, Mulungushi Investment Limited, was founded to acquire
a 50% investment in the newly established Societe de Coulee Continue de
Cuivre, a continuous cast rod company in France. The purpose of this
investment is to provide a base for future expansion of copper sales into a
growing market segment.
A. Organization and Management
3.02     ZCCM's Board of Directors consists of 12 members; seven are
appointed by ZIMCO, the majority shareholder, and five are nominated by the
minority shareholders and represent the interests of the Anglo and AMAX
groups. The Board meets quarterly and provides overall guidance and
supervision to the Company's operations. The Chairman of the Board, who is
also ZCCM's Chief Executive, is appointed by ZIMCO, but de facto nominated
directly by the President of the Republic of Zambia. The present Chairman,
Mr. F. H. Kaunda, had been NCCM's Managing Director since 1975.
3.03     Reflecting the Company's history, ZCCM's organizational structure is
characterized by the centralization in Lusaka of all functional lines of
command such as Technical Support, Finance, Corporate Planning, Purchasing
and Marketing, and Manpower Development and by the geographical separation of
its production divisions. After the merger, ZCCM asked Booz, Allen and
Hamilton, of the USA, to assist in defining the Company's new organizational
set-up. The reorganization at the top of the Company, which has already
taken place, is timely and important in view of the increased needs for



- 9 -
strong management and control at this difficult time of the copper industry's
history. The new top management structure is shown in the organization chart
in Annex 3-3.
3.04     Of particular interest is the creation of a Corporate Planning
Department to strengthen the Company's strategic planning capability. The
Department will be, within ZCCM, the unit in charge of formulating production
and investment strategies to attain the objectives defined by the Government,
and of estimating the human and financial resources, required for the
implementation of such strategies. It has now been considerably strengthened
and is presently composed of an economist, three technical staff (a
geologist, a mining engineer and a metallurgist), a transport specialist, a
metals market specialist (para. 4.24), two financial analysts and two
economists.  Its mandate is to carry out the coordination of all personnel,
financial, geological, mining, metallurgical and commercial plans related to
the development, preparation, interpretation and revis.on of the Company's
long-term corporate plans.  ZCCM has agreed to maintain the adequacy of the
size and qualification of the permanent staff of its Corporate Planning
Department.
3.05     The Chief Executive is assisted at headquarters by a managerial and
technical staff of about 305, including 280 Zambians, and 12 out of the 29
top positions are occupied by Zambians. In addition to the Executive and che
Management Liaison Committees established at the recommendation of Booz,
Allen and Hamilton to facilitate flow of information and decision-making
among the Company's top managers, there are three additional technical
committees: the Industry Production Committee, to review production plans
and achievements and to advise top management on matters relating to industry
production and sales; the Job Evaluation Committee, to evaluate all senior
staff positions; and the Industry Accident Prevention Committee, to review
the Company's safety conditions. Other technical committees are formed on an
ad-hoc basis to review the Company's production and service operations in the
fields of geology, mining, metallurgy, engineering and ordering and supply
management.
3.06     ZCCM's operations are organized into seven self-contained production
divisions operating the mines and surface plants: Konkola, Nchanga, Nkana,
Luanshya, Mufulira and Kalulushi on the Copperbelt, and Kabwe off the
Copperbelt to the south. 1/ Each Division is headed by a General Manager,
who reports to the Executive Director of Operations and is assisted by four
managers (Mines, Metallurgy, Engineering, and Personnel). Eight of the 29
top positions at the division level are occupied by Zambians, underlining the
lack of Zambians with enough technical expertise and seniority to fill senior
posit.ons. In addition, two service divisions, administration and
engineering, have been created from such similar support divisions of NCCM
and RCM. ZCCM is basically a production company and does not have a
marketing division. Practically all its sales are for export and are made
through the Metal Marketing Corporation of Zambia Limited (MEMACO), a
state-owned company with responsibility for marketing all of Zambia's mineral
products (para. 4.15).
1/ Prior to the merger, these divisions were called: Konkola, Chingola,
Rokana, Luanshya, Mufulira, Chibuluma, and Broken Hill, respectively.



- 10 -
3.07     In mid-1983, Booz, Allen and Hamilton submitted initial reviews
regarding the organization of each of ZCCM's divisions and associated
services, concluding to the suitability of the original (geographical)
structure of the operating divisions. Their further work will address the
changes needed to improve the information reporting among the divisions and
with the head offices in Lusaka. This phase is expected to be completed by
April 1984. ZCCM has agreed to present by June 30, 1984, for discussion with
the Bank the proposed information reporting system.
B.  Mining and Processing Facilities
3.08     ZCCM's production facilities are an intricate and interdependent
matrix of operations spread over a 150-km crescent on the Copperbelt (Map IBRD
16492). A simplified operations diagram is presented in Annex 3-4 on the
following page. The details of each division's facilities and operations are
presented in the Project File (B.8), and these are summarized below.
3.09     Mining Facilities.  There are 12 separate ore bodies:  the deposits
near the surface are most economically exploited in eight open pits using
electric shovels and large trucks; while the deeper or steeply-inclined
deposits are being mined underground by a variety of methods including
sub-level caving and blast hole open stoping, with the ore being hoisted to
the surface in 19 shafts.
3.10     Processing Facilities.  The metallurgical operations are complex
because the copper and cobalt are contained in both sulfide and oxide ores.
To extract the metals, it is necessary to treat the oxide minerals by one
process and the sulfide minerals by another and, to the exten- possible, to
treat the cobalt minerals separately from the copper minerals. Twelve
concentrators with a total feed capacity of 36.6 million tpy of ore and a
total production capacity of 2.3 million tpy of concentrates produce six
different concentrates that are fed into ten metallurgical plants. The
technology and equipment date from the 1930s to the 1980s. Old reverberatory
furnaces are used to melt the sulfide concentrates and comprise three
coal-fired furnaces at Luanshya, five coal- or oil-fired furnaces at Nkana,
and three coal- or oil-fired furnaces plus a modern 36-MW electric furnace at
Mufulira.
3.11     It is in the smelter that the complexity and interdependence of
ZCCM's operations are observed most.  The sulfide ores do not contain enough
sulfide for proper smelting, and iron sulfides in the form of pyrite
concentrates have to be brought in from the Nampundwe mine located near
Kabwe. Also, most of the sulfuric acid used for leaching oxide copper is
produced from the sulfur dioxide released in the smelter during matte
converting. In addition, precious metals follow the copper into the blister
then into the anodes, and are removed at the end of an electro-refining cycle,
washed, and processed at the Ndola precious metals plant to recover refined,
marketable gold and silver and a crude selenium product.
3.12     ZCCM's total smelting/refining capacity is estimated at 630,000 tpy
of refined copper, and its leaching plants have a combined capacity of about
263,000 tpy. Hence, ZCCM's total capacity to produce marketable copper is
about 863,000 tpy, a level neither ZCCM, nor before it, NCCM and RCM combined,
ever achieved. The plants produced 575,500 tonnes in 1982/83, including



- 11 -
15,100 tonnes of electrowon copper (99.5% copper), 445,300 tonnes of
electrorefined copper (99.97% copper) and 115,100 tonnes of wirebars (99.95%
copper). In addition, they produced 2,200 tonnes of cathode cobalt, and minor
quantities of gold, silver, and crude selenium.
3.13      Outside the Copperbelt, the Kabwe Division operates an underground
mine, a concentrator, a smelter and hydrometallurgical plant and, in 1982/83,
produced 15,200 tonnes of lead, 39,400 tonnes of zinc, and minor quantities of
cadmium.
3.14      IFC Projects in ZCCM.  IFC approved two investments to NCCM, one of
US$20 million in 1979 for the expansion of the cobalt plant of the Nkana
Division, and another of DM 70 million in 1981 for the expansion of the
tailing leach plant of the Nchanga Division. Details of these investments can
be found in reports IFC/P-354 and I-FC/P-462.
C. Manpower and Training
3.15      ZCCM is a major employer in Zambia, with a total work force at
December 1983 of about 57,300 people, including 55,400 Zambians and 1,900
expatriates, as summarized in the table below.

The Zambian employees are members of the Mining Workers Union of Zambia, wh'ich
negotiates three-year pay agreements and other benefits on behalf of its
members. Turnover is low at less than 6% and labor relations are good; there
has been no major labor unrest for ten years, reflecting the fact that ZCCM,
and before NCCM and RCM, have been following a rather generous employment
policy, first by preserving their employees' jobs even under extreme economic
conditions, and second by offering monetary and non-monetary compensation
packages substantially more attractive than those offered elsewhere by ZIMCO,
and well above the national average. Low copper prices and the resulting
squeeze on its financial resources have of late forced ZCCM to rely on
attrition and early retirement schemes to reduce its local work force and



- 12 -
increase its overall productivity. As a result, ZCCM's local work force was
reduced by 570 during 1981/82 and 1,990 during 1982/83, and is expected to
decrease by another 300 during 1983/84.
3.16     The wage bill for local labor represents the second largest single
production cost item at about 26% (para. 3.29), and hence the determination of
salary levels is especially significant in ZCM1's effort to contain its
production costs. This is particularly true at a time when ZCCM's generally
high compensation levels raise questions about adequate income distribution
throughout Zambia and about the merits and risks of continuing a priviledged
situation for the mining work force. The situation has admittedly not been
well studied but deserves consideration as the size of ZCCM's work force and
its compensation levels affect not only ZCCM's productivity and financial
health, but also the allocation of Zambia's human and financial resources to
other sectors of economy. ZCCM has agreed to prepare by September 30, 1984, a
document for discussion with the Bank on the monetary and non-monetary
benefits available to its local work force at all grades. The document would
permit the Government to review the comparative! advantages enjoyed by ZCCM
employees as compared to similar positions within the ZIMCO group and in the
private sector. Following the review of this clocument, the Government and
ZCCM have agreed to present to the Bank by December 31, 1984, an action plan
to arrive at appropriate levels of the monetary and/or non-monetary
compensation by ZCCM to its local work force.
3.17     Expatriate staff decreased from 16% of ZCCM's (then NCCM and RCM)
labor force at independence in 1964, to 10% in 1971 when the Zambianization
policy was introduced, and further to 3.5% in 1983. In 1964, steps were taken
to provide for increased Zambian participation at managerial levels, through
fragmentation of jobs and job responsibilities. While the organizational
change was appropriate at that time, ZCCM's staffing structure has now become
overly cumbersome, and there is a need for the Company to take steps to
achieve more simplified lines of responsibility within the mining operations.
This is the objective of the second phase of the Booz, Allen, and Hamilton
study (para. 3.07). Aware of its need for expetrienced expatriates at
managerial and professional levels, ZCCM is actively recruiting through
Zambian Appointments Limited (ZAL), a 100% subsidiary of ZCCM established in
London. Several factors contributed to making recruiting and retaining
expatriates difficult. First, the terms of employment include salaries far
from competitive with comparable level salaries in traditional mining
countries. Second, the Government, as part of its Zambianization program,
limited the reinittance of foreign exchange to expatriates. Third, expatriates
were limited to three-year contracts which tended to discourage them from
seeking a life career in Zambia. Finally, deteriorating living conditions and
the personal security problems that have existed since the political strife in
southern Africa have discouraged mid-career expatriates from accepting
positions or remaining in Zambia. Middle management particularly has become
increasingly weakened by the continuous departure of expatriates because of
the deteriorating competitiveness of compensation benefits: 65% of the
expatriate work force has left within five years of service, and 53% is 34
years old or younger, in an industry where experience is essential.



- 13 -
3.18     Effective April 1982, a new compensation policy was implemented to
retain or attract experienced expatriate staff. Under the new scheme,
expatriates receive a total compensation package competitive again by
international standards, paid partly in kwacha (essentially the same salary as
their Zambian counterparts) and partly as a tax-free expatriation allowance.
Being then able to retain and attract expatriates of distinctly higher
qualification and experience, the new scheme was accompanied by a reduction in
the size of the expatriate work force, from about 2,600 in early 1982 to about
1,900 in late 1983. While practically all those released were in the lower
echelons, and could be readily replaced by Zambians with either adequate
qualifications or with the potential to acquire them, the scale and suddennes"
of the reduction is expected to create in the short term disruptions at the
operations of each Division.
3.19     A detailed description of the manpower situation and training
activities in Zambia is contained in Annex 3-5. Training of Zambians is
supported by both the Government and ZCCM's Department of Manpower Development
and Training, but has been insufficient to fill the growing list of
vacancies. There is an absolute shortage of academically prepared candidates
to undertake and complete advanced training in mine-related fields, due
largely to a general weakness in secondary education, particularly in
mathematics and sciences. In June 1980, there were only 27 graduates from the
School of Mines and 22 from the School of Engineering at the University of
Zambia. Overseas training has been more limited, notwithstanding active roles
in recruitment and sponsorship of Zambian candidates for training by the
companies themselves both locally and abroad: in the academic years ended
June 1981 and 1982, there were 14 overseas graduates in mining and in minerals
engineering.
3.20     The continuing departure of expatriate employees, and the shortage of
trainable candidates are forcing ZCCM to (i) identify its shortfalls in
required skills at all operating levels; (ii) define priorities for filling
existing or future vacancies; (iii) reformulate its training and skills
upgrading program for its Zambian work force; and (iv) define a realistic
policy for a gradual replacement of expatriates by Zambians. ZCCM has agreed
to prepare by September 30, 1984, a comprehensive training program consistent
with its training priorities and with the human and financial resources which
can be allocated to training.

Bank staff estimates.
3.22      The main problem encountered by ZCCM (and before by RCM and NCCM) has
been the mines' inability to deliver sufficient tonnages of suitable- grade ore
to the concentrators. Mining output, which was 36 million tonnes in 1974, has
decreased at an average annual rate of 3%, to 28 million tonnes in 1982. By
contrast, the metallurgical plants, comprising concentrators, smelters and
refineries, are largely underutilized. The declining tonnages are due to
several factors. First, the ore reserve grade tends to decline with increasing
depths as mining operations move away from the secondary enrichment zones into
primary sulfides. Second, there is a lack of adequate mine development and
stope preparation in underground mines, and of adequate overburden removal in
the open pits, mostly for lack of equipment in proper working order. The fully
developed reserves represent about nine months of mining on average, which is
low by mining standards, and as little as four to five months in some mines.
As a result, the mines have very little flexibility in meeting daily production
targets. Tn addition, the already extensive use of overtime leaves very little
slack to expand production to meet monthly targets.



- 15 -
3.23     Third, the lack of development tends to increase dilution (tonnage of
waste rock per tonne of ore mined), since in an attempt to meet the
concentrators' capacity, development waste tends to be trammed as ore and
stopes are drawn. The average millhead copper grade was 2.46% copper in 1974
and has declined steadly since then to 2.15% copper in 1983,and the amount of
ore required to produce one tonne of finished copper was 56 tonnes in 1983 as
compared to 43 tonnes ten years earlier, notwithstanding recent tailings leach
retreatment of previously mined materials. Average dilution is now around
40%, which is high by any mining standard; it varies from mine to mine (from
practically zero in the open pit to over 90% in the underground mines),
depending on the developed reserve position, ground conditions and mining
methods, and the ability of mine supervisors to maintain efficient
operations.  The high dilution can be explained, in part, by geological
hanging wall conditions at particular Copperbelt mines where the mining method
breaks waste in the footwall and ground conditions are weak. However,
increased dilution in recent years (from about 25% in 1976 to about 40% at
present) has exceeded that normally expected from changing technical
conditions and seems to reflect more on ineffective supervision and management
of mine operations and workers and lack of adequate mine planning. Finally,
copper recovery in the concentrators tends to fall with declining millhead
grade as the concentrator operations are geared to a constant tailings discard
grade.
3.24     Overall productivity of the Zambian copper industry has as a result
decreased steadily over the last years, from an average of 12.3 tonnes per
employee in the 1973-76 period, to 11.7 tonnes per employee in 1977 to 9.7
tonnes per employee in 1981, improving only slightly in 1983 to 10.0 tonnes
per employee. This compares to about 12.6 tonnes per employee in Zaire and
30.8 tonnes per employee in Chile. This trend is due to two main factors.
First, ZCCM's underground mines are largely unmechanized and labor-intensive
with a resultant low output per manshift. Second, there is a general lack of
discipline among mine workers attributable to the weaknesses of the managerial
structure and to the lack of incentives built into the wage structure.
Despite the decline in productivity, how-ver, it is still more economical for
the mines to use labor- rather than capital-intensive production methods,
given the high cost of capital, shortages in foreign exchange for capital
expenditures, and shortages in skilled maintenance technicians.
3.25     There is a need to carry out a critical review of all of ZCCM's
mining operations, particularly underground, in order to (i) assess the
geological and geotechnical factors affecting operations; (ii) re-assess the
suitability of the present mining methods; (iii) prepare adequate development
and mine plans; (iv) determine appropriate cut-off grades; (v) improve mining
controls such as sampling, surveying and grade control; and (vi) organize the
proper supervision and discipline, together with an attractive incentive
scheme for the workers, in order to increase labor productivity. The coverage
of such mining audits and the details of their implementation are presented in
Chapter V. ZCCM has agreed to undertake by December 31, 1984 a comprehensive
review of its mining operations, and to prepare by March 31, 1985, an action
plan to increase mining controls, reduce dilution and increase labor
productivity.

3.27     Total production costs increased from 55 cents/lb in 1978 to 82
cents/lb in 1982, at an average annual increase of 10%, with most of the
increase (43%) attributable to the mining costs. After the cost cutting
measures adopted in 1983 (paras. 3.32) and the devaluation of the kwacha,
total production costs decreased to 69 cents/lb in 1983. In real terms, the
annual increase was about 1-2%. Total costs, including freight, insurance and
financial charges, increased from 64 cents/lb in 1978 to 95 cents/lb in 1982,
and decreased to 80 cents/lb in 1983. Total unit costs are high when compared
with similar costs in other copper producing countries: there are about 70-75
cents/lb in Chile and Peru and 80-85 cents/lb in the USA, despite the fact
that Zambian ore contains at least twice as much copper per tonne of ore mined
aE in Latin America or the USA. This is attributable mostly to the high
proportion of underground mining, low productivity, poor mine planning,
control and supervision, and high dilution.



- 17 -
3.28     The most important activity, production of ore in mining operations,
accounts for almost half of total production costs, and is an obvious target
for introduction of new mining techniques and control, to increase
productivity and reduce costs. The combined production costs for
concentration, leaching, smelting and refining, representing 28% of total
production costs, are less significant. Those activities are also the ones
where in the long term the merger of NCCM and RCM into a single company are
expected to provide greater opportunity for rationalization and optimization.
Administrative costs have remained fairly high in the past due to the fact
that ZCCM has to bear the cost of providing social services to practically
the whole population of the Copperbelt, but have declined somewhat as a
result of the creation of ZCCM, and now represent about 16% of total
production costs.
3.29     Of the total production costs, 36% is for labor (of which about 10%
alone for expatriate labor), 38% for operation materials, spare parts and
maintenance stores, 8% for fuel, and 4% for electricity. At present levels of
production, it is estimated that about 63% of the total costs are fixed, and
that about 47% represents its direct or indirect foreign exchange component
and about 49% its total foreign exchange requirements including debt service.
The above results show that Zambia's production cost is in the top 30 percent
of copper producers worldwide, partly because of the Company's strategy of
maximizing production. ZCCM has agreed to undertake by March 31, 1985, in
collaboration with its consultants, a study of the cost, financial, economic
and social implications of reducing output by closing economically and
financially unjustified operations such as Nkana Central, Kansanshi, Konkola
No. 3, Chibuluma, Torco, Mindola, or other mines/facilities over a two-three
year period. This would include the formulation of a detailed schedule and
action program for such closures (para. 3.43).
3.30     The high foreign exchange content of copper production costs makes
the industry sensitive and vulnerable to shortages and delays in obtaining
foreign exchange from the Government, and in fact, stringent foreign exchange
conditions in Zambia for the past five years have had serious adverse effects
on the copper sector's performance. Unavailability of foreign exchange for
spare parts, machinery, equipment, reagents and other intermediary goods has
caused increased equipment downtimes and increasing maintenance problems in
all Copperbelt operations. Government procedures for import licensing and
foreign exchange allocations have also increased the Company's foreign
exchange problems by allowing the allocation to be made on discretionary
basis. While a Technical Committee and an Official Committee of Permanent
Secretaries composed of representatives of relevant ministries and agencies
reviewed and decided the foreign exchange allocations on a sectorial and
company basis, the issuance of import licenses was made by the Ministry of
Commerce and monthly allocations of foreign exchange to commercial banks were
made by the Bank of Zambia. For example, the Company had been given priority
in obtaining six-month blanket import licenses for goods purchased abroad and
in establishing limited imprest accounts outside Zambia, but the blanket
licenses were often not supported by payment authorization from the Bank of
Zambia. While in fact ZCCM has fared reasonably well in obtaining foreign
exchange relative to the rest of the country, the necessity to apply continual
pressure on the Government on a day-to-day basis and the uncertainty of
foreign exchange receipts have been difficult conditions under which to
operate.



- 18 -
3.31     A new foreign exchange allocation scheme was put in place hy the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Zambia, effective June 1982. The policy
accords ZCCM priority access to foreign exchange on a monthly basis, up to 50%
of its metal sales proceeds in that month to cover its direct foreign exchange
requirements (about 35%), as well as the foreign exchange requirements of its
local suppliers (about 15%). To implement this policy, a Permanent Committee
consisting of representatives of ZCCM, the Bank of Zambia, and the Ministries
of Finance and Mines has been created. ZCCM has been authorized to open bank
accounts in foreign currencies, to be operated by Zambia Engineering Services
Limited (ZES), its wholly-owned subsidiary, and the use of the funds no long
requires prior approval of the Bank of Zambia. While the procedure for using
the funds has worked relatively well, Zambia's other foreign exchange
requirements, most notably for debt servicing and for essential goods, have
not permitted adherence to the 50% ratio. For example, Zambia's annual gross
foreign exchange earnings were about USl.O-l.]L billion during 1982-83,
compared to US$1.5-1.6 billion annually in the prior years, and ZCCM received
only about 25% of its metal proceeds during 1982-83. Following the extension
of Zambia's debt by the Paris and London Clubs in 1983, overall foreign
exchange allocation policy to ZCCM has been reviewed. The Government has
agreed to a minimum foreign exchange allocation to ZCCM of about US$350
million during 1984, representing about 35% of ZCCM's estimated sales proceeds
during that year. Local suppliers would have dlirect access to foreign
exchange through Zambia's normal import licensing and foreign exchange
allocation procedures. For the subsequent years, ZCCM has agreed to submit to
the Government, not later than August 31 of each year, an estimate of its
foreign exchange requirement for the following calendar year; and the
Government has agreed to present to the Bank for approval, by October 31 of
each year, its proposed foreign exchange allocation amount to ZCCM for the
following calendar year.
F. Cost Cutting Measures
3.32     In May 1982, pressed by plunging copper prices and lack of funds,
ZCCM prepared a survival budget, including drastic cost cutting measures, that
forecast a reduction in operating costs of about K 95 million (US490 million)
or 8% and a reduction in capital expenditures of about K 41 million (US$39
million), or 17%. The results of 12 months of cost cutting have been better
than forecast, as shown in the table below.

During 1982/83, ZCGM was able to reduce its total operating and capital costs
by an additional K 145 million (US4138 million) over the austerity budget
decided last year, mostly through the departure of local and expatriate
personnel (US$30 million), savings in materials and consumables (US$42
million), and deferment of capital investments (US$41 million).
3.33     Financial charges increased well beyond the forecast levels because
low copper prices forced the Company into heavy borrowings, and the store
holding levels remained much higher than anticipated partly because of an
overhang of orders placed the year before and partly because materials savings
left a good part of the stores inventories untouched.
3.34     Prior to merger, both companies used similar, but not identical,
inventory management and procurement procedures. Each operating division had
its own warehouse but used central procurement services, with procurement
agents in Kitwe, Ashford (U.K.), New York, Johannesburg, and Harare. Since
the merger, procurement has been consolidated and rationalized. ZCCM uses a
computerized procurement procedure based on inventory codings including all
but capital equipment, major spares and infrequently ordered items. The
status of routine spares and supplies, about 250,000 items, is checked twice a
week by the computer to identify items which are out of stock or below pre-set



- 20 -
minimum levels. The computer then automaticalLy prints out a list of
potential suppliers and after manual check, prepares the order. The inventory
and spare parts management suffer from several deficiencies: (i) procedural,
since no priority setting exists to decide which items should be ordered
first; (ii) human, since the clerks doing the checking do not know the
relative importance of the items being ordered and since, at the same time,
Divisions hoard choice items in their own warehouses; and (iii) financial,
since unpaid invoices from previous orders prevent the shipment of new
priority items by the suppliers. ZCCM has agreed to formulate by December 31,
1984 a comprehensive equipment maintenance and replacement program, to
reorganize its stores inventory management and to prepare an integrated
purchasing and ordering system.
3.35     To a good extent, many cost cutting measures such as the departure of
expatriates and the reduction in the size of the local work force can be
considered permanent; others, such as extending the life of equipment and
spares, are less irreversible. During 1984, ZCCM expects to reduce its
operating costs by another 8%, mostly through further reductions in the size
of its work force, improvements in its purchasing methods, and reduction of
some social services. Considering the success of last year's program, and the
austerity mentality now prevailing within the Company, these additional cuts
are not unrealistic. In the long term, however, the cost reductions will come
mostly from (i) increases in productivity at the mines; (ii) rationalization
of ZCCM's operations as a result of the merger; (iii) introduction of adequate
divisional cost accounting systems to permit continuous control of the
Divisions' performance; and (iv) establishment of a systematic approach to
budget preparation and to cost/benefit analysis of capital expenditure
proposals.
G. Past Financial Results
3.36     Audited financial statements for NCCM and for RCM during the years
1978-81 are given in Annexes 3-6 and 3-7. Combined financial statements for
NCCM and RCM for the 1978-80 period, and audited financial statements for ZCCM
during the years 1981-83 are given in Annexes 3-8 and 3-9 and are summarized

3.37     With copper sales representing on the average 88% of total revenues
during the period, the Company's financial performance has essentially
followed the cycle of copper prices. Until 1982, costs on the other hand,
increased regularly on a per tonne basis (para. 3.28) and in absolute terms,
leading to losses in years of low copper prices. Even in 1980, a year of
high copper prices, production costs amounted to 75% of sales. In 1983, the
austerity measures permitted for the first time a reduction in costs, but
even lower copper prices resulted in yet another year of large losses. The
deep and persistent slump in copper prices for the last three years has hurt
ZCCM most dramatically, as it was combined with a consistent decline in
copper production. The result has been a net total loss of K 302 million
(US$311 million) in 1982 and 1983 combined, by far the largest in the history
of the Zambian copper industry. The recent change in the parity of the
Kwacha, together with continued austerity measures, has however, halted this
loss trend and permitted a small profit during the first six months of 1984.
3.38     ZCCM's funds flow statement for the 1978-83 period is summarized
below. The summary reflects the effects of low copper prices and the
Company's lack of profitability during the period, with cash generation
accounting for only 24% of ZCCM's sources of funds. During the period, ZCCM
was forced, because of cash flow and foreign exchange difficulties and heavy
debt service commitments, to restrain capital investments for expansion,
replacement and modernization of its facilities to a total of K 938 million
(Us$1,050 million), or only 58% of its funds applications. To cover its
heavy losses in 1982 and 1983, ZCCM incurred large amounts of short-term debt
and made extensive use of bank overdrafts.

3.39     Despite a deteriorating cash flow position, ZCCM's balance sheet has
improved substantially in the late 1970s as a result of the Government's
converting outstanding long-term debt to equity. The Government converted
its K 66 million (US$81 million) loan to NCCM into equity in 1977 and K 40
million (USW50 million) of its K 134 million loan to RCM into equity in 1979,
thereby increasing its equity participation in both companies to about 60%.
By 1980, ZCCM's long-term debt/equity ratio had improved to 14:86, and at the
end of 1981, when ZCCM was established, ZCCM share capital was fixed at K 900



- 23 -
million, of which K 893 million were paid-in. This was practically a
doubling of the combined share capital of NCCM and RCM, which was made
possible by capitalizing the accumulated reserves of both companies.
3.40     ZCCM's financial structure deteriorated sharply in 1982 and again in
1983, as a result of the poor performance of those years. Net working
capital decreased from K 204 million in 1981 to K 82 million in 1983; its
current ratio declined from 1.4 to 1.1; and its long-term debt/equity ratio
deteriorated from 19:81 to 51:49.
3.41     In February 1983, ZCCM's Board approved a number of measures to
improve on the structure of its balance sheet after verifying with the
atuditing profession that these were in line with Zambia's accounting
policies. First, it introduced new accounting practices in order to (i)
spread over the lives of the loans the losses related to the January 1983 and
subsequent devaluations of the kwacha; (ii) restate at parity the value of
assets acquired abroad and financed by long-term loans repayable after the
devaluation; and (iii) capitalize the interest costs of loans to finance new
assets until such assets are brought into use. It also agreed on the
principle of a revaluation of the fixed assets of the Company. Second, it
authorized negotiations (i) with the Government on the subordination to all
other loans, subordinating K 203 million (US$193 million) of government
loans, and (ii) with its minority shareholders on the issue of new share
capital. After subordination of government loans, approved in July 1983,
ZCCM's long-term debt to equity and quasi-equity ratio has improved from
51:49 to 36:64. Also, during the 1983 Paris and London Club meetings, about
K 85 million (US$65 million) of ZCCM's debt (including debt in arrears and
due in 1983) was rescheduled, which is expected to improve the Company's
liquidity situation during 1984-86.
H. Rehabilitation Program
3.42     As illustrated throughout Chapter III, the crisis of the last three
years, while considerably damaging ZCCM's ability to produce copper
economically, has provided also the shock necessary to start a complete
restructuring of ZCCM's operations, organization, and finances. Some
decisions, particularly in cost cutting were, since the establishment of ZCCM
in April 1982, drastic enough in the last year to avert near-bankrupcy for
the Company, and augur rather well for its survival and slow recovery. Many
actions initiated will have, however, to be continued and accelerated if ZCCM
is to regain enough strength to absorb price fluctuations in the copper
market (Chapter IV). These actions have been discussed in the preceding
paragraphs and the key elements of ZCCM's rehabilitation program are
summarized in the synopsis and in the implementation schedule presented on
the following pages.

3.43      Following Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, ZCCM selected
Standford Research Institute International (SRI), of the USA to assist the
Company to (i) formulate management, production and investment strategies
consistent with the broad objectives assigned to it by the Government; (ii)
review and establish capacity and production levels of ZCCM which can be
justified from an economic, financial and market point of view for the short,
medium and long term; (iii) define the optimum use of ZCCM's mining and
metallurgical facilities resulting from the merger of NCCM and RCM; (iv)
introduce methods of systematic cost/benefit analysis of investment; and (v)
rationalize cost accounting methods and budget preparation. By June 30,
1985, ZCCM would present to the Bank for review and discussions action
programs on (i) its reorganization (para. 3.07); (ii) the training of its
local work force (para. 3.20); (iii) improvement in the productivity of its
mining operations (para. 3.25); (iv) the shutting down of financially and
economically unjustified facilities (para. 3.29); (v) its purchasing/ordering
systems (para. 3.34); and (vi) the rationalization of its operations (para.
3.35). ZCGM has agreed to prepare by December 31, 1985 for Bank approval on
the basis of all the studies prepared and of all the action programs
formulated, a production and investment strategy, to attain the objectives
set by the Government (para. 2.23), as well as a comprehensive program of
actions to implement such strategies. Approval of the program of actions and
agreement of its implementation would be required prior to releasing the
second tranche of the proposed loan (para. 6.12).

IV. THE METALS MARKETS
4.01 The key world market factors and current and projected prices, have been
reviewed for ZCCM's major metal products, copper, cobalt, zinc and lead,
accounting for over 95% of ZCCK's sales over the forecast period. Price
projections used in this report are summarized in the table below, and are
discussed in more detail for copper in this Chapter. Fuller details of the
copper market together with discussions of the cobalt market and of the lead
and zinc markets are presented in Annexes 4-1 through 4-3.

A presentation of the copper, lead and zinc markets was made in the report
Price Prospects for Major Primary Commodities prepared by the Economic
Analysis and Projections Department (Report No. 814/82, of July 1982).
Information is also available in the Project File (C.1 to C.4). That report
is presently being updated and a new presentation will be provided in Report
814/84 due to be issued in mid-1984. A key feature of metal prices is their
volatility, and in this presentation, projections of prices until 1990 are
made taking account of various cyclical price scenarios, while longer-term
projections are made on a trend basis.
A. The Copper Market
1.   International Supply and Demand
4.02     The supply of copper comes from two sources--primary (mine)
production (85%) and secondary (scrap) production (15%). Copper mine
production is concentrated in the developing countries whereas secondary
production occurs almost entirely in the industrialized countries. In
1981, LDCi accounted for 60% of world 1/ copper raine production, up from
1/  All sta'istic   efer to World excluding Centrally "lanned Economies
unlss  therw,se no ed.



- 2 7 -
52% in 1970, and 83% of their production was exported to industrialized
countries. Zambia is the second largest LDC copper producer with 9% of world
production in 1981, all of it exported. Centrally Planned Economies (CPEs)
are largely self-sufficient in copper, and export 0.01-0.05 million tpy to
market economy countries.
4.03     Unlike supply, copper demand is geographically concentrated in the
industrialized countries which accounted for 78% of world refined copper
consumption in 1981. Copper has important electrical and thermal
conductivity and corrosion-resistance characteristics. The electrical sector
accounts for about 50% of copper consumption. Other important sectors are
machinery (20%), construction (14%) and transportation (10%). World copper
consumption grew strongly at 4.2% per annum from 1960-70, but consumption
growth fell off to 2.4% per annum during 1970-80. This decline was due, in
part, to lower economic growth rates in industrialized countries, and also to
a decline in the intensity of use of copper because of more efficient use of
copper in specific applications, reduction in unit weight of finished goods,
(e.g.. smaller automobiles) and loss of markets to substitutes, (e.g.,
aluminum, glass fiber optics and plastics). In future, some further
reduction in intensity of use is to be expected in certain automotive and
information technology applications and further losses may occur to aluminum
for automobile radiators and plastics in building construction. Such losses
may be partly counterbalanced by gains in new markets such as solar energy
applications and electric vehicles.
4.04     Tne copper market is subject to sharp fluctuations in supply-demand
balance and has been characterized by four-to-five year cycles of growth and
decline for the past several decades. During the 1970s, copper booms
occurred in 1973/74 and 1979/80. Outside of these years, however, the copper
market has been very depressed. It collapsed in 1975 following the oil
crisis and since then has experienced excessive inventories and oversupply
due to the reluctance of many producers to cut back production in line with
poor demand recovery. For the past several years, the industry has been
faced with substantial excess production capacity. In the face of persistent
oversupply and low prices, many copper producers have introduced stringent
austerity measures to cut costs and reduce capacity. Recent estimates
indicate that about 0.5 million tonnes of mine annual capacity have been
permanently closed in recent years, and about 0.9 million tonnes have been
temporarily closed or placed on a care and maintenance basis due to lack of
demand. In 1982 and 1983, world mine capacity utilization averaged about
78%. Even so, copper production exceeded consumption by about 0.6 million
tonnes and total inventories of refined copper at end 1983 were estimated at
over 2.5 million tonnes, compared with normal levels of 0.8-1.0 million
tonnes.
4.05     Low, medium, and high demand cases have been developed on the basis of
three different economic scenarios, with future GDP growth rates in the range
of 2.6-3.6% per annum for the industrialized countries and 4.0-5.4% per annum
for LDCs. In the low case, future economic growth is assumed to be little
better than in the 1970s. In the high case, future economic growth is
assumed to recover to the levels of the 1960s and early 1970s. The medium
case is between these two. Based on these three scenarios, future copper
demand growth is estimated in the range 0.7-1.9% per annum, which would
result in a refined copper demand of 8.0-9.2 million tonnes in 1995.



- 28 -
Present primary and secondary production capacity is estimated at about 9.3
million tpy indicating that the only requirement for additional capacity is
to replace mine closings. However, various rehabilitations and expansions
are presently underway or have a very high probiability of being implemented
in the late 1980s, notably in Chile, Peru, Papua New Guinea, Canada and
Philippines, which are expected to provide an additional 0.5 million tonnes
of new annual capacity by early 1990s. It is expected, therefore, that
without substantial further mine closings and a major cutback in industry
investment patterns, there will be continued over capacity at least until the
early 1990s.
2.   Copper Prices
4.06     The bulk of international copper trade, including ZCCM's exports,
takes place at London Metal Exchange (LME) prices. LME copper prices have
historically shown large fluctuations following a four-to-five year cycle in
line with underlying supply/demand conditions. With the exception of
upswings in 1973/74 and 1979/80 copper prices have been depressed for most of
the past decade, as shown in the table below.

(US$/lb--current terms)
1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983

Cash Cost n.a. n.a. 0.52 n.a. n.a. n.a. 0.64 0.72 0.77 0.74 0.70
4.07     In 1982 copper prices averaged 67 cents/lb--their lowest in real
terms at any time in the post-war period. By comparison, industry sources
estimate that average industry production costs in 1982 were 74 cents per lb
(including bi-product credits and interest, but excluding depreciation), and
that less than 50% of the world copper industry was able to cover direct cash
costs in 1982, a situation which improved only slightly in 1983.
4.08     For the next several years, prices are expected to increase as
demand improves, as shown in the following table.

There is little concensus regarding the timing or strength of future price
increases. Some analysts predict a strong near-term recovery with prices of
US$1.00-1.10 per lb in an upswing in 1985-86 whereas others project a more
gradual increase in copper prices to 85-90 cents per lb in 1987-88. Low,
realistic and high case price projections have been prepared for the financial
projections presented in this report on the basis of three underlying supply/
demand scenarios outlined in Annex 4-1. To the extent that probabilities can
be estimated, it is considered that there is a 20% probability that prices
will be below the low case, a 10% probability that they will be above the high
case and a 70% probability that they will be somewhere in between. All three
cases take into account possible cyclical factors during 1983-90, reflecting
the view that as in the past, copper prices will continue to follow a cyclical
pattern around a long-term upward trend. Based on copper price behavior over
the past two decades, the cycle would have a periodicity of about 5-6 years
and an amplitude of up to 40 cents per lb.
4.09     From 1990 onwards, no attempt has been made to predict the timing or
impact of short-term cyclical factors. Instead, copper prices have been
projected on a long-term trend basis related to production costs for existing
and incremental capacity. This long-run cost curve is relatively sensitive
to the rate at which new capacity is required. To the extent that demand
increases slowly and a basic oversupply persists, prices will be related to
cash production costs, estimated at 60-70 cents per lb in 1983 terms. Should
demand increase more strongly and if producers adjust capacity in line with
demand, prices would be closer to incremental production costs for
expansions, estimated at 80-90 cents per lb, also in 1983 terms.
B. Transport Routes
4.10     The unreliability of transportation has, to a large extent been
related to years of political instability in Southern Africa. Zambia must
find suitable routes both for its copper exports and for its imports of its
equipment, spare parts, and reagents, for its mining production as well as
general goods and services for the mining community. Following the closure
in 1975 of the western railway to Lobito Bay via Angola, the eastern road
(TANZAM) and rail (TAZARA) routes via Dar es Salaam became the main transport
routes for copper and for needed imports although additional traffic was also
routed via Mombasa, Beira and Nacala (IBRD Map 17004). However, disruptions
and operating difficulties on the TAZARA rail line, together with severe port
congestion at Dar es Salaam, have resulted in as much as 50% of copper
traffic being routed through East London in recent years. However, the
situation has improved in the past two years, when about 71% of the copper
shipments were made via Dar es Salaam.

4.11    The best alternative route, through Angola, is still closed due to
insurgent activity and the road route to Mombasa is not available due to the
Tanzania/Kenya conflict.  Also, ZCCM is reluctant to use the road/rail routes
through Mozambique except in emergencies because those routes cross a war
zone and there is limited capacity and poor reliability due to guerilla
attacks and the resultant severe deterioration of the facilities.
4.12    The eastern route operated by TAZARA to Dar es Salaam is preferred by
the Zambian copper industry because (i) the southern route is longer and
nearly 60% more expenisive; (ii) it is vulnerable to disruption in the event
of future political unrest; and (iii) South Africa and Zimbabwe railways must
be paid in hard currency, whereas TAZARA is paid in kwacha.

The route to Dar es Salaam has been subject to disruptions and delays in past
years. The most serious problems have been major bottlenecks evacuating
imports from the port resulting in considerable! demurrage delavs for ships
waiting to berth and load or unload cargo. Because of this, many vessels
have been diverted to East London where there is very little waiting to berth
and where turnaround times are much shorter. This diversion of ocean traffic
to East London has resulted in a shortage of backhaul import traffic from Dar
es Salaam to Zambia without which rail cars and road trucks will not return.
More recently, the situation at the port of Dar es Salaam has improved. The
Dar es Salaam port problems are being addressed by a proposed port project
scheduled for negotiations in March 1984.
4.13     TAZARA's performance has also declined due to inadequate maintenance
of locomotives and rolling stock and deterioration of the railway track.
Some actions have been initiated to improve the situation. Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), of the Federal Republic of Germany is financing nine new
locomotives and the re-engineering of another eight locomotives. A study of
the physical assets of the TAZARA has been financed by UNDP and the Bank is
financing a study of the management and operation of the railway, due to be
completed in May 1984. However, substantial improvement of the railways may
take several years to accomplish. Actions are also being taken to improve
the TANZAM road route from Zambia to Dar es Salaam. Under the Highway V
project (Credit No. 876-TA), a feasibility study and detailed engineering for
the strengthening and rehabilitation of the road system and reorganization of
maintenance have been completed. These will prcovide the basis of a proposed
road rehabilitation project.
4.14     The diversion of traffic to the southern route results in
transportation costs increasing by about US$50 per ton of copper. Copper
freight rates on Zambia Railways are higher than for other bulk commodities



- 31 -
such as maize, and it is generally recognized that copper revenues are used
to subsidize other freight. At present, ZCCM holds separate rate
negotiations each year with the Zambian, Zimbabwe and South African
railroads. The additional shipments on the southern route also make the
industry more vulnerable to any disruption in the traffic flows due to
political problems in Zimbabwe or South Africa.
C. Metal Marketing Corporation of Zambia, Ltd.(MEMACO)
1.   Background and Organization
4.15     MEMACO was established in 1973 as the sole marketing agent for
Zambian metal production. Prior to MEMACO being formed, sales for NCCM and
RCM were undertaken by AMACOZA (the Anglo American marketing company) and
AMATELCO (the AMAX marketing company), respectively. MEMACO is 100% owned by
ZIMCO and the ZCCM's Chairman and Chief Executive is on MEMACO's Board.
4.16     MEM4ACO is based in Lusaka and has 90 employees.  It also has a
fully-owned subsidiary based in London, Memaco Services Limited (MSL), with a
staff of 50. MEMACO's policy is to locate as much of its activities as
possible in Lusaka. However, MSL will continue to be a key organization
responsible for almost all of the metals selling activities for MEMACO
because of the importance of London as a world trading center for non-ferrous
metals and as a focal point of contact for metal buyers and sellers.  With
the sole exception of the Research Manager, all of the senior staff in London
were previously with AMACOZA or AMATELCO and joined MEMACO when it was
formed. The MFMACO and MSL senior staff appear to be both competent and
professional in their approach to marketing ZCCM's production.
2.   Activities and Sales
4.17     MEMACO is responsible for all sales of ZCCM's production to foreign
customers (the mining company itself sells some small amounts of copper to
Zambian consumers). MEMACO deals directly with buyers and signs contracts as
ZCCM's agent. MEMACO takes charge of the copper at the port of export and is
responsible for ocean freight, insurance, sales document preparation and
handling to the point of receipt by foreign customers--generally on arrival
at the receiving port. MEMACO is also responsible for administering and
selling small copper and cobalt inventories that are held in Europe and the
USA and for providing market intelligence and projections to ZCCM. MEMACO's
income comes from sales fees of 0.75% of the sales receipts for copper, 2.5%
for cobalt, 1.0% for zinc and 1.5% for lead, which is reasonably in line with
charges by other marketing companies. Based on its fee income, MEMACO has
made regular after tax profits averaging K 2.5 million per annum (or US$3.0
million) in the past five years. ZCCM has agreed to market its products
according to ordinary commercial practices and on the basis of arm's-length
arrangements ensuring that at no time it will receive less than the full
ex-works commercial price (subject to normal trade discounts) for its
products.

Practically all the sales to France are made to a continuous rod casting
plant at Chauny (para. 3.01). The plant processed 153,200 tonnes of copper
in 1982/83, of which 65% was for the French market, and the rest in Europe,
Africa and Asia.
4.19      Cobalt sales are more concentrated in the USA and in the UK, as
shown in the table below.

The USA is the major buyer of Zambian cobalt production, with the United
Kingdom as a second important purchaser. Sales to CPEs are also relatively
important. Cobalt sales to Japan are negligible because the Japanese
purchase concentrates and matte from Pacific basin mining operations for
processing into refined metal. In recent years the Japanese have become
exporters of refined cobalt metal, competing with Zambia and other sellers.
4.20     Lead and zinc production and sales are relatively small.  Both
metals have low grade specifications, due to the presence of various minor
impurities, and tend to be sold to nearby purchasers in Africa and Asia,
especially India, where the penalty for the impurities is lower than in
Europe, Japan, or the USA.
3.   Sales Strategy
4.21     The marketing of copper does not present major difficulties.
Zambian copper is of very good quality. It can find a ready market even in
times of depressed market conditions. Normally annual sales contracts are
signed in October/November of each year and indicate maximum/minimum purchase
volumes. Price is based on the prevailing LME Settlement Price at the time
of delivery subject to certain quality premiums. Major buyers place orders
generally on a monthly basis and provide a mid-year estimate of total
purchases for the year. Small surpluses are sold to traders or through the
LME. In the event of a poor market and a large surplus of uncommitted
production, however, additional contracts will be signed in mid-year with
other buyers who will generally make adjustments to their other sources of
supply to take Zambian copper, if offered to them, in preference to
alternative lower-quality supplies. Like other producers, Zambia has
progressively increased its cathode production and reduced its wirebar



- 34 -
production in line with market sales trends in recent years. In 1982,
refined cathodes accounted for about 73% of total sales while wirebars and
other shapes accounted for 19% and 8%, respectively.
4.22     Unlike copper, cobalt marketing involves critical judgments both in
terms of setting selling prices and in terms of finding market outlets.
Zambia sells mostly refined cobalt in the form of cathode chips. A super
high-quality, vacuum-induced refined cobalt, suitable for super-alloy
applications is presently being tested and should be a new product during
1984. Sales contracts are signed on an annual basis and are in the range
20-100 tonnes for most customers. Since the cobalt market is in a condition
of severe oversupply, many producers, including Zambia, are holding large
inventories of cobalt. At the end of 1983, Zambia had around 2,000 tonnes of
cobalt metal of which half was held in inventory at the mine and half was in
the transport pipeline or held in warehouses in Europe or in the USA.  The
minehead material is held in the form of partially processed hydroxides
whereas the material in the pipeline and in warehouses is in refined metal
form.
4.23     Zambia has historically followed a poLicy of selling cobalt at a
producer price which was set by Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation des
Minerais (SOZACOM). But in recent years the market price has been at a large
discount to the producer price causing both Zambia and Zaire to lose their
competitiveness. The sharp drop in MEMACO's market share in the UK during
1980-82 was largely due to losing customers to marginal suppliers such as
Japanese and Canadian suppliers who were sellirLg cobalt at very low prices on
the British market due to falling sales elsewhetre. In 1983, MEMACO largely
regained its UK market share by being more price competitive and by regaining
customers from marginal suppliers. With regard to the USA, which accouuLts
for about 40% of world cobalt consumption, MEMACO plans to increase its sales
by developing a stronger presence thereby increasing its sales especially to
existing customers. MEMACO's target is a 25% market share within the next
one to two years. While Zambia's present customers account for over 70% of
US cobalt consumption, Zambia only provides a small part of their cobalt
usage and has a market penetration of only about 12%. MEMACO has decided to
increase sales penetration to these companies using sales agent to act on
behalf of MEMACO. It must, however, be recognized that any increase in
market share can only come at the expense of either Zaire or the marginal
producers and, while generally pointing in the right direction, the MEMACO
strategy is not yet comprehensive in terms of dealing with the overall mix of
pricing, sales terms, inventory policy, and quality considerations and may
well have much less effectiveness in increasing market share than they
presently anticipate.
4.   Market Intelligence
4.24     MEMACO is also responsible for providing market intelligence reports
to ZCCM. Short term market views are generally provided on a quarterly basis
and are prepared by the metals traders. Longer term views are prepared by
ZCCM's Corporate Planning Department. While it is not necessary for MEMACO
to be able to make its own long term forecasts for ZCCM's products, given the
importance of future price movements to ZCCM's financial planning, there is a
role for MEMACO to play in reviewing and commenting on projections which are
received from outside groups. For example, MEMA.CO and ZCCM receive price



- 35 -
projections for copper from the CIPEC Secretariat and for lead and zinc from
the International Lead Zinc Study Group (ILZSG). MEMACO could usefully
provide comments to ZCCM on the assumptions, strengths and weaknesses of these
projections since MEMACO staff have more ready access to the marketplace and
to CIPEC and ILZSG staff. While there is already considerable contact
between the senior managers of ZCCM and the Managing Director of MEMACO and
there are also frequent mneetings between staff of the different organizations
there is also a need to formalize the information flow regarding the metals
markets from MEMACO to ZCCM's Corporate Planning Department and to prepare
regular, written market assessments including price projections which would
provide input into the planning activities of ZCCM's Corporate Planning
Department. The creation of a position of a market economist within the
Corporate Planning Department (para. 3.04) is expected to provide the necessary
channel of communications between MEMACO and ZCCM, particularly between MEMACO's
intelligence work and ZCCM planning work. ZCCM has agreed to increase coordi-
nation with MEMACO on all levels so that market constraints and price forecasts
are fully reflected in the Company's production, investment and financial
projections and regular written market assessments including price projections
are prepared as part of ZCCM's planning activities.
V. THE PROJECT
A. ZCCM Investment Program (1984-88)
5.01     ZCCM's present five-year investment program (1984-88) comprises
three major categories. The first category represents investments for
replacement and rehabilitation of existing facilities and is the object of
the proposed Project. The second relates to major projects, and includes
preparation of new ore blocks for future excavation, modifications of the
concentrators and metallurgical plants, and construction of the tailings
leach plant. The major investment items are (i) deepening of shafts or the
sinking of sub-vertical shafts at Nchanga, Mufulira, Mindola and Konkola
together with the expansion of the pump chambers; (ii) construction of the
acid plant at Chambishi; (iii) expansion of the mining area at Baluba and
Kalulushi; and (iv) construction of the tailings leach plant at Chingola.
All those investments are necessary in the next five years to replace
decreasing production from mining areas where reserves will be depleted (e.g.
Nkana, Luanshya and Bwana). The third category relates to better working and
living conditions and includes social services such as housing, medical and
educational facilities, upgrading water, electrical and telephone systems,
ZCCM's new office building and improving training facilities.
5.02     The investment program prepared in late 1983 totals about K 1.3
billion, or US$o.9 billion. Of this, 60% is budgeted for rehabilitation, 35%
for major projects, and 5% for ancillaries. About half of this budget is for
already on-going projects, leaving another half which can directly be
adjusted to match future financing limitations. An investment program of
this magnitude will depend heavily on market conditions and on the Company's
ability to generate internal funds and to borrow to fill the financing gap.
Present market prospects and ZCCM's financial outlook require urgently a
re-examination of (i) production targets in the short, medium and long term,
and (ii) investment priorities, particularly for the 1985-88 period. ZCCM



- 36 -
and the Government will, as part of the Project, reassess the medium-term
investment approach.
B. Objectives of the Rehabilitation Project
5.03     The proposed Project covers the Company's 1984-86 replacement and
rehabilitation investments required to improve ZCCM's performance and competi-
tiveness and its contribution to net foreign exchange earnings. Its primary
objectives are:
(a) to review and establish capacity and production levels for ZCCM
which can be justified from an economic, financial and market point
of view for the short, medium and long term; and
(b) to assist ZCCM adopt a management and investment strategy in line
with such production and capacity targets.
The Project consists of three major components: (i) replacement and
rehabilitation investments for high-priority equipment and spares to
rehabilitate existing mine and plant facilities; (ii) a training program to
upgrade skills of the technical and supervisory work force; and (iii)
technical studies to rationalize ZCCM's operations.
C.  Project Description
1.   Replacement and Rehabilitation Component
5.04     The replacement and rehabilitation component would consist of
numerous small projects to maintain the productive capacity of the existing
facilities. Replacement means total replacement of worn and obsolete
equipment, while rehabilitation is the rebuilding and replacing of small
components of large facilities in order to improve on their efficiency,
availability or safety. This would include:
(a) in the mining operations: replacement of worn and obsolete
equipment used in breaking, digging, hauling and crushing the ore,
in dewatering and ventilating the mines, and in compressing air
acquisition and installation of trolley assist electrical equipment.
(b) in the concentrators: replacement of worn crushers, pumps and
motors, replacement of old, less efficient flotation cells with
larger cells of modern design, and rehabilitation of the tailings
disposal and slurry pumping systems; and
(c) in the metallurgical plants: modification of gas handling
equipment, upgrading of control systems, and rehabilitation of
conveyors, cranes, crushers, and ore storage.
Finally, the Project would include replacement of mobile equipment such as
front-end loaders, cranes, trucks, buses and personnel carriers.
2.   Training Component
5.05     The training component would consist of:
(a) training of mining engineers at the University of Zambia, including
field project work, to increase the number of graduates from 30 per



- 37 -
year at present to about 50 per year by 1989. This will require
four additional lecturers and four additional laboratory and
workshop technicians;
(b) training of technicians and technologists at the Zambia Institute of
Technology (ZIT) to increase the number of students in mining,
metallurgy, surveying and ventilation from 30-40 per year at present
to 120-150 per year by 1986. Seventeen new courses will be offered,
requiring an increase in teaching staff from 10 at present to 16, as
well as additional equipment and materials for existing classrooms,
workshops, laboratories, and accommodations for staff;
(c) on-the-job training courses, to support crafts training in existing
facilities and catering for training of 120 craftsmen per year in
electrical and plant fitter trades and 50 welding specialists per
year. This will require eight additional training staff, equipment
and material for crafts training, as well as a 120-man hostel to
accommodate the trainees at the Craft Training Center at Kitwe;
(d) on-the-job training abroad for engineers, technicians and craftsmen,
in the form of about 90 fellowships; and
(e) management training courses for supervisory staff from junior
supervisors to top management, in supervisory work, financing,
budgeting and communication skills, with a particular emphasis on
cost reduction. This would require four training staff and vehicles
and materials.
3.   Technical Studies Component
5.06     The technical studies component will focus on the optimization of
ZCCM's operations, to gain the full benefit from the merger of NCCM and RCM.
This study complements the management studies being carried out by Booz,
Allen and Hamilton (para. 3.07) and will cover all technical aspects of
ZCCM's operations, i.e., mining, concentration and metal extraction. The
technical studies will include:
(a) review of mining operations, including review of mineral resources,
underground mining methods, and recommendations on mining controls
to reduce dilution;
(b) rationalization and optimization of ZCCM's mining and metallurgical
operations and recommendations on changes reflecting the greater
flexibility gained by the merger;
(c) preparation of a schedule of action program for closing unecomical
mines; and
(d)  formulation of a comprehensive equipment maintenance and replacement
program.
Also, studies will be undertaken in order to:



- 38 -
(e) introduce standard procedures for investment decisions, including
systematic financial and economic cost/benefit analyses of
investments;
(~f) revamp the present purchasing/ordering, and warehousing systems; and
(g) implement a new divisional cost control accounting and budgeting
systems.
Draft terms of reference for these studies were prepared by ZCCM and reviewed
during negotiations; they will be finalized by March 31, 1984. These studies
will give ZCCM, and in particular its Corporate Planning Department, the
information and tools to formulate alternative scenarios of development for
the Company (para. 3.42).
D. Project Implementation and Schedule
5.07      The various components of the Project will be implemented by their
respective departments in ZCCM. For the replacement and rehabilitation
component, the Divisional management will provide technical specifications,
assist in bid evaluation and manage all on-site work, while procurement
itself will be handled by the purchasing group of ZCCM's Central Services
Division. For the training component, the Department of Manpower Development
and Training will manage the Education and Training Unit (ETU) portion and
will coordinate training at the ZIT and at the University of Zambia. The
studies will be carried out under the responsibility of and coordinated by
the Corporate Planning Department and will involve the Technical Department
as well as practically every Operational Division in the Company. ZCCM's
Chairman and Chief Executive has agreed to involve himself in all important
reviews and decisions pertinent to the studies. While in a Project of this
nature, it is unavoidable that implementation responsibilities be
disseminated throughout the Company, ZCCM has the ability to carry out all
tasks without undue burden on its organizational structure. In fact, its
recent reorganization should greatly facilitate proper allocation of tasks
and efficiency in carrying them out. ZCCM has agreed to discuss with the Bank
by December 31, 1984 the adequacy of the coordinating role of its Corporate
Planning Department in carrying out the studies under the Project.
5.08     The activities described above represent about two-and-a-half years
of ZCCM's rehabilitation effort. An implementation schedule for the three
project components is given in Annex 5-1. The training component would be
carried out from mid-1984 to early 1987; and the technical and other studies,
which started in mid-1983 (para. 6.09) and would be concluded by December 1985.
The replacement and rehabilitation component would be carried out in two
tranches, the first between about mid-1984 and end of 1985 and the second
mostly during 1986. As mentioned (para. 3.43), the second tranche of this
component, and hence the second tranche of the proposed loan, would only
start after the studies have been carried out and ZCCM, the Government and
the Bank have agreed on the implementation of a program of actions to realize
ZCCM's investment strategy. Conditions of disbursement on the second tranche
aredetailed in para. 6.12. The implementation of the Project assumes that
the second two-and-a-half year segment of the rehabilitation program would
also be carried out. The scope of the second segment will to a good extent,
depend on tIhe conclusions of the studies discussed in Chapter III, and in
particular on the production and investment strategy defined as a result of
those studies.



- 39 -
E. Environmental Aspects and Safety
5.09     Significant quantities of gaseous, liquid, and solid wastes are a
by-product of large-scale recovery of metals from ores. The disposal of
these wastes is currently regulated by the Government's Mines and Minerals
Act of March 1977. Presently, ZCCM undertakes all environmental monitoring
of the Company's operations. (Project File B.9) Monthly water samples,
taken from all mine, concentrator and plant sites as well as from the
townsite areas, are routinely analyzed for pH, solids, hardness, and for
copper, cobalt, iron, manganese, lead, cadmium, cyanide, and sulfate
content. Air quality is checked at each mining operation, by a ventilation
engineer, who monitors the atmosphere of both underground and surface
operations to detect mining equipment exhaust and to determine carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxides,
moisture, temperature, and dust levels.
5.10     Gaseous and Particulate Emissions.  The sulfur in the concentrates
is almost totally oxidized to sulfur dioxide. In ZCCM's operations, about
half of this sulfur dioxide is captured as sulfuric acid and eventually
reports in solid wastes as calcium sulfate. The other half is discharged
from the many stacks on the Copperbelt. The gases and dust particles from
these stacks disburse over the entire district but of course are strongest
within the plant and close town area. Typically, within the plant areas
where smelting is done the SO2 and particulates exceed all standards (Annex
5-2) but measurement of SO2 in the town area does, however, meet standards.
5.11     Liquid Effluents.  Large quantities of water and chemicals are added
to the finely ground ore during concentration and to concentrates during the
leaching operations. This water, containing both soluble and insoluble
matters, is discharged into neighboring streams after it has been trated with
lime in tailings ponds or dams. Since 1971, the mining industry has
monitored, and reported, the effluents from their operations. As typical
results of monitoring the flows which discharge directly from operations,
drain mine and plant areas, and the river above and below the operations,
indicate (Annex 5-2), pH is within standards but total suspended solids are
well above. If one ignores the metal content of these suspended solids, the
streams and rivers do meet US and Canadian standards, but the discharges from
plants and mines do not.
5.12     While monitoring and control of pollution levels by ZCCM is
generally adequate, in practice the quantities of effluents exceed the limits
accepted in the industrialized countries, in part because the government
agencies are not equipped to police and enforce the present regulations, and
in part because the regulations themselves are loosely worded and leave the
industries practically free rein on all environmental matters. The National
Council of Scientific Affairs is presently preparing a new, more
comprehensive act to address these environmental concerns. The Government
has agreed to allow the Bank an opportunity to comment on the new
regulations, and ZCCM has agreed to abide by internationally accepted
pollution control standards.
5.13     Health and safety are monitored by both the Government and ZCCM
according to codes based on the British Safety and Work Act and the US
Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations. Particular attention is
given to minimizing pneumococcus in mine workers, industrial deafness, and



- 40 -
blood lead contents in Kabwe employees. ZCCM is required by the Government
to provide health services to all one million residents of the Copperbelt,
not just to ZCCM employees and their dependents. With the exception of a
catastrophic accident at the Mufulira mine in 1970, the Company has a good
safety record.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Costs
6.01     As summarized below, the total financing required for the
rehabilitation project is estimated at US$300 million, of which US$224
million, or 75% is in foreign exchange. For a total of US$268 million
including allowances for physical contingencies, about US$254 million (95%)
will be needed for the rehabilitation and replacement component, US$12
million (4%) for the training component, and US$2 million (1%) for the
technical studies component.

6.02     The capital costs estimates were prepared in February 1983 by ZCCM
with the assistance of Zambia Engineering Services (ZES), a 100% subsidiary of
ZCCM handling most of the Company's engineering work. The final base cost
estimate was updated by ZCCM during December 1983 and January 1984 and is
expressed in January 1984 terms. The difficulty in the cost estimation has
been to determine which equipment items can be considered as rehabilitation
and replacement equipment, as compared to consumables and spares on the one
hand, and to new or major investment on the other. Overall the estimating
method had been adequate and the capital costs estimates, reviewed extensively
during March 1983, are considered to be reliable, particularly since many of
the items are equipment used on a regular basis by ZCCM. Physical contingency
allowances are estimated at 10% of total base cost; and price contingencies
are based on escalation for foreign costs, in US dollar terms, of 8, 7.5, 7
and 6% in 1983, 84, 85 and 86, respectively. Consultant services are
estimated on the basis of 139 man-months, at a cost of about US$13,500 per
man-month, including salaries, subsistence, and air transportation, and are
considered reasonable.
B. Financing Plan
6.03     The financing plan of the Project is summarized as follows:
Financing Plan
WS$ million
Local   Foreign    Total       _
Debt
IBRD                             0.8       74.2       75.0    25
EEC-SYSMIN                        -        45.8       45.8    15
African Development Bank          -        27.3       27.3     9
Total                          0.8     147.3      148.1    49
Equity
Internal Cash Generation        74.9       77.0     151.9    51
Total Financing                   75.7      224.3      300.0   100
6.04     The Project would be financed 49% by debt and the remaining 51% by
equity. The proposed Bank loan of US75 million will cover about 25% of the
total financing required or 33% of the Project's total foreign exchange
requirements. The ECU 55 million loan (US$46 million) of the Minerals System
(SYSMIN) facility of the European Economic Community (EEC) was approved in
April 1982 and became effective in September 1982. It will finance the
replacement of obsolete production equipment, works and supply contracts for
mine infrastructure; drilling equipment; technical assistance for training;
and the establishment of a fund for improving the social environment. The
SYSMIN loan is for 40 years, including ten years of grace at 1% interest rate
p.a. The cost to ZCCM, however, is a 20-year loan, including two years of
grace, at 6% interest rate p.a., with the difference being kept in a separate
account credited to a social fund and spent on improvement of the social
environment. The African Development Bank (AfDB) approved in September 1982 a
loan of 26.02 million units of account (US$27 million), to finance replacement
equipment and spares. The AfDB loan would be for 13 years, including three



- 42 -
years of grace, and bear an interest rate of 9.5% p.a. The effectiveness of
the AfDB loan would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The
Company is considered capable of meeting its share of the project cost in
local and foreign currencies from internal cash generation (para. 7.11).
Should the Project experience a cost increase, ZCCM has agreed to finance the
increase by borrowing and/or increasing its share capital within a maximum
overall 50:50 debt/equity ratio. In order to ensure that the training program
started under the Project is continued afterwards, ZCCM has agreed to continue
to carry out and finance the training program after Project Completion.
6.05     The proposed Bank loan of US$75 million would be extended to the
Government for 20 years, including five years of grace at the prevailing
variable interest rate. The Zambian Governmernt would on-lend the funds to
ZCCM for 15 years, including three years of grace, at the Bank's prevailing
interest rate at the time the legal documents are signed plus a 10% premium. 1/
ZCCM will bear the foreign exchange risk and reimburse to the Government the
front-end and commitment fees on the Bank loan. Signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and ZCCM, acceptable to the Bank, would be a
condition of Bank loan effectiveness. Satisfactory assurances have been
obtained from the Government that adequate access to foreign exchange and
local currency will be provided to complete the Project.
C. Procurement
6.06     Procurement for all Bank-financed items will follow the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Procurement of items financed by EEC-SYSMIN, and the
AfDB will follow the respective procurement procedures of these institutions.
6.07     Equipment and Spare Parts.  Equipment including about two years of
spare parts and transport to Zambia will be procured primarily through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using Bank Procurement Guidelines.
However, about US$10 million, or about 13% of the proposed Bank loan, will be
procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) to replace equipment
which can only be supplied by a limited number of manufacturers able to
provide equipment suitable to replace existing mine and plant equipment. This
would also include packages costing less than US$300,000 each, up to an
aggregate amount of US$3 million. Some of the mine equipment can be
manufactured locally or supplied by local agents. The Zambian manufacturers
will receive a 15% preference, or the amount of customs duty whichever is
lower. In addition, approximately US415 million, or about 20% of the proposed
Bank loan, will be used by direct purchase of proprietary equipment which will
replace or add to proprietary equipment already operating in the mines and
plants. Equipment items to be financed by the Bank have been grouped into
packages acceptable to the Bank. Since the proposed loan would be disbursed
into two tranches (para. 6.12), the packages will be divided in two groups, so
that procurement and disbursement would correspond to the proposed tranches.
6.08     Training.  Contracting for training staff and for civil works will be
handled by the Education and Training Unit of ZCaM and will be done following
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
1/ For the purpose of the financial projections, an effective rate of 11.1%
p.a. has been assumed.



- 43 -
6.09     Technical Studies.  The major part of the technical studies has
already been contracted under procedures following Bank Guidelines. ZCCM
selected Stanford Research Institute International (SRI) of the USA from four
international consulting firms to carry out the technical studies. SRI made a
diagnosis of ZCCM's operations in late 1982/1983 and had submitted a study
proposal by July 1983. The remainder of the studies, namely the mining
audits, will also be contracted under Bank Guidelines. Considering the need
to start the rehabilitation studies as quickly as possible, ZCCM signed in
July 1983 a contract with SRI with Bank approval for some of the studies.
Therefore, ZCCM has requested that the Bank consider retroactive financing of
the technical studies for payment in foreign exchange made to SRI for the
diagnosis as well as for the work carried out prior to the signing of the
loan. Retroactive financing up to US$0.4 million for expenses incurred after
July 1, 1983, is recommended.
6.10     Contract Review.  On the basis of ZCCM's list of procurement
packages, the Bank would do a prior review of bidding documents for packages
estimated to value more than US$500,000 (about 30 equipment packages with a
total value of about US$57 million, or 82% of equipment financing). Packages
below US$500,000 (about 40 equipment packages valued at about US$13 million)
would be subject to post review by the Bank. To ensure proper adherence to
Bank procurement procedures, the first two procurement packages handled by
ZCCM's Purchasing Department will be reviewed irrespective of their value and
of whether they are procured through direct purchase, LIB, or LCB.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.11     The Bank Loan of US$75 million would finance goods, services and
front-end fee as detailed in Annex 6-1 and as summarized in the table below:
Allocation of Bank Loan
(US$ million)
Loan Allocation    % of Expenditure
Category                          Amount        %      to be financed

- 44 -
For expenditures eligible for Bank financing, disbursements would cover 100%
of foreign expenditures for imported equipment, materials and spares; 100% of
the ex-factory cost of equipment supplies by local firms winning under
international competition (excluding local taxes); 80% of local expenditures
for items provided through local agents; 100% of the foreign cost of
consulting services by foreign consultants; and 100% of the total cost of
training. In order to ensure that funds for the proposed Project would be
made available when needed, a Special Account, operated by ZCCM, would be
established in the Bank of Zambia with the initial deposit of US$l million
which would be withdrawn after effectiveness. The account would be
replenished on the basis of documentary evidence, to be provided to the Bank
by ZCCM, of payments made from the account for goods and services required for
the Project. It is expected that the account would be used mainly for
payments against the civil works, training anci technical studies categories.
6.12     The disbursement profile for the Project (Annex 6-2) is based on
estimates of order placements, payment schedules, and expected delivery
times. It differs from the standard profile for industrial projects as the
proposed Project is a rehabilitation project, the extent of civil works and
erection is limited, and the implementation period for this Project is
considerably less than for a greenfield industrial project. Disbursement
against the equipment and spare parts category would be divided into two
tranches. The first tranche would be of US$40 million, and the second of
USM30 million. The first tranche would cover disbursements until about
December 31, 1985. The second tranche would only be released after certain
actions, discussed in Chapter III, have taken place, namely!/:
(i) ZCCI1 shall have presented to the Bank for review and discussions the
studies on:
(a) the reorganization and information reporting system (para. 3.07);
(b) the monetary and non-monetary benefits available to its local
work force (para. 3.16);
(c)  an action plan to contain or reduce its local wage bill (para.
3.16);
(d) a comprehensive training program (para. 3.20);
(e)  an action plan to increase mining controls, reduce dilution and
increase labor productivity (para. 3.25);
(f) an action plan of closing uneconomical mines (para. 3.29);
(g) the reorganization of its store inventory management and of its
purchasing and ordering systems (para 3.34); and
(h) an austerity program based on the rationalization of its
operations (para. 3.35).
(ii) the Gsovernment and ZCCM shall have ?resented to the Bank a
satisfactory program of actions to attain the objectives set to the
Company by the Government (para. 2.23). Such program of actions
1/ Another condition of disbursement relates to the progress made by the
government in carrying out an action program and is fully described in
the President's Report.



- 45 -
would integrate the recommendations of the studies mentioned in (i)
above and define the resulting investment and production programs
(para. 3.43); such programs would be based on production and capacity
levels established as justifiable from an economic, financial and
market point of view in the short, medium and long term and
specifically address:
(a)  coordination of market/marketing prospects and production
potential;
(b)  year-by-year targets for cutting overhead costs, reduce dilution
and increase mine productivity during 1986-88;
(c)  a year-by-year program of closure of those facilities which are
not financially and economically viable; and
(d)  priority ranking and justification of replacement or new
investment projects for the 1986-88 period.
(iii) the amounts of foreign exchange received by ZCCM from the Government
shall have been at the agreed levels (para. 3.31).
The detailed content of the second tranche of the equipment and spare parts
category (Annex 6-1) will be reviewed in light of the results of the above
studies and agreement, to ensure optimum use of the proceeds of the Bank
loan. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1987.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01     While it is realized that the economically justified production and
investment levels may change as a result of the studies undertaken under the
project, for the time being and for illustration purposes, financial
projections for ZCCM have been prepared in current kwacha terms based on (i)
assumed copper production levels of 570,000 tonnes by 1984 and thereafter (ii)
increased copper production of up to about 52,000 tonnes as a result of the
Tailings Leach 3 project; (iii) capital and operating costs taking into
account the operating cost cutting ZCCM achieved last year, and projected
additional cost savings; and (iv) expected metal prices. The projections are
based on a prevailing exchange rate of K 1.41 to a dollar in 1983/84 and
K 1.60 to a dollar thereafter and the following inflation assumptions for
foreign and local costs, consistent with the calendar years.

7.03     Following the collapse of the cobalt market, ZCCM curtailed its
production of cobalt significantly. A production capacity of 4,500 tonnes was
planned for 1983, but actual production was only 2,200 tonnes. ZCCM's planned
cobalt capacity and projected production and sales are shown below.

7.04     Sales revenues are based on the projected sales volumes and average
price levels for copper, cobalt, lead and zinc prices based on the realistic
case projected in Chapter IV. As noted in para. 4.08, copper prices are
subject to considerable fluctuations, and it is estimated that there is a
60-70% probability that future prices be within a +20% range of the base case
assumptions. In addition, copper prices presented below include a 2% premium
realized by ZCCM over LME copper prices. Base case price assumptions are
given below:

B. Operating Costs
7.05     Operating costs were developed on the basis of ZCCM's present cost
structure, taking into account actual operating costs for ZCCM's mine in 1983
and the continuation of the cost cutting measures started in 1983. Operating
costs have been estimated by ZCCM on the basis of the Company's current
operations and of projected materials, fuel, energy, transport and spare parts
consumption as well as personnel requirements for each of the mines and plants.
C. Financial Projections
7.06     Financial projections of ZCCM's financial performance for 1984-90
have been prepared on the basis of assumptions presented in Annex 7-1.
Detailed projected financial statements are given in Annexes 7-2 through 7-4
and are summarized on the following page. The reduction in operating costs
(in constant terms), coupled with increases in copper prices, is expected to
slowly restore the profitability of ZCCM's operations. In 1984, ZCCM is
expected to make a small loss of K 2 million, (US$1.3 million), and then to
generate an annual profit after taxes of K 30 million (US$19 million) in 1985
(or 2% of sales revenue) increasing to K 102 million (US$64 million) in 1987
(or 4% of sales revenue).
7.07    WThile future copper price cycles are expected to occur, estimates of
their timing and amplitudes must be viewed as tentative. If the downturn of
copper prices expected in the late 1980s actually takes place ZCCM will return
to the loss situation in 1989 and having to borrow massively to finance its
losses. While price cyclicality is beyond the control of ZCCM, there are
several measures that can prepare the Company for the bad times resulting from
price downturns. First, the production and investment strategy to be prepared
before the end of 1985 (para. 3.43) should take into account, and permit
flexibility in establishing production levels limiting losses. Second, the
program of actions to complement ZCCM's production and investment strategies
(para. 3.43) will be accompanied by corresponding five-year financial
projections, which should help define the new structure of the Company's
balance sheet needed to implement such program.
7.08     Third, the dividend distribution and tax regime applicable to ZCCM
should allow accumulation of reserves to cushion losses incurred during the
bad years. As mentioned (para. 2.16), ZCCM is heavily taxed when it is
profitable and is also obligated to distribute most of its after tax profit as
dividends, and as a result is not in a position to absorb the effects of
lowering copper prices. Such profit distribution system is unusual in the
base metals industry. The table below shows the total taxation applicable to
ZCCM over the next five years, in the case of high copper prices.

Total direct taxation applicable to ZCCM represents more than its net income
before taxes, and up to 83% of its internal cash generation, which in turn
prevents (i) strengthening of the Company's financial structure while prices
are high; (ii) accumulation of reserves to absorb the leaner years; and (iii)
investment at adequate levels in rehabilitation and replacement. There is an
urgent need to study the present profit distribution system and its effect on
ZCCM's finances. The Government and ZCCM have agreed to have a study carried
out by December 31, 1984 of the fiscal regime now applicable to ZCCM and of
the changes necessary to permit at the same time adequate tax revenues to the
Government and adequate reserves on ZCCM's accounts to protect its financial
standing. Such study should determine in particular, (i) the appropriate
depreciation and amortization policies applicable to ZCCM; (ii) the type of
taxation required, e.g., export tax, mineral tax, and income tax and the
relation between them; (iii) the appropriate level of statutory reserves; and
(iv) the dividend payments allowable after taxation and creation of
reserves. Finally, a change in the parity of the kwacha would, as it has
recently, improve on the Company's liquidity. Should the parity of the
kwacha increase to an average of K 1.79 to a dollar in 1984/85 and K 1.85 to
a dollar thereafter, ZCCM's net income after taxes and internal cash
generated during the 1984-88 period would increase by K 266 million (US4146
million), and K 876 million (US$491 million), respectively.
D. Breakeven Analysis
7.09     Profit and cash breakeven prices have been calculated for copper on
an annual basis and are presented in the table below:

In 1983, the realized copper price was significantly lower than both the
profit and cash breakeven prices. In the future, breakeven prices are
expected to increase at about 8% per annum in current terms. On the basis of
the base case realizable price, in 1984, the Company's copper operations are
expected to be on the threshold of profitability, as the base case copper
price and profit breakeven price are within a half cent of each other and to
be profitable from 1985 until copper prices begin to cycle downward again in
the late l980's. Unless the downturn in copper prices is stronger than
expected, ZCCM could be expected to cover its cash costs throughout the
forecast period.
E. Sensitivity Analysis
7.10     ZCCM's future financial position has been examined considering
possible price variations presented in para. 7.09. The impact of variations
in copper prices and their cyclical nature is summarized in the following
table of key indicators for ZCCM during the period of the Project (1985-87).

a/  Base = Base case;  Low = pessimistic price case;  High = optimistic price

7.11     As expected, these indicators confirm that the Company is highly
vulnerable to downward movements in copper prices. The results presented
above underline the difficulties ZCCM and the Government will face: while the
base case provides a reasonable starting point for a financial review, there
is a 60-70% chance that ZCCM's finances be anywhere between the low and high
cases. If copper prices fail to recover as expected during this period,
ZCCM's net worth would remain positive, but its internal cash generation would
be negative and the Government, as well as the minority shareholders, would be
required to infuse additional funds into the Company if the Project or other
planned investments were to be carried out. Ii- expected copper prices

materialize or are better, the Company will be able to finance its equity
contribution to the Project (para. 6.03) and its net capital position
will improve until copper prices cycle down again in the late 1980s. The
timing and extent of copper as well as the measures to be agreed upon at
the end of 1984 (paras. 7.07 and 7.08) will largely determine the key
indicators for the late 1980's, when copper prices are expected to decline
again.
F. Financial Covenants
7.12     In order to ensure the necessary financing for the Project and
its completion in a sound manner, agreement has been reached on the
following financial covenants:
(a)  from the Government
(i)  that it will ensure ZCCM has adequate access to
sufficient foreign exchange and local currency to
complete the Project; and
(ii) that it will abide by the financial covenants to
ensure ZCCM viability and ability to implement the
Project.
(b)  from ZCCM
(i) that it will prepare every year a five-year financial
projection, including its foreign exchange and local
currency requirements and planned expenditures on an
annual basis;
(ii) that, in any given year, it will not make new capital
investments, i.e., additional to the already approved
investment program, exceeding in aggregate US$30 million
until Project Completion without prior Bank approval;
(iii) that it will ensure that its tangible net worth is at
least K 900 million at all times; and
(iv) that it will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2
to 1 from 1986 onwards; a ratio of debt to equity plus
subordinated debt of not more than 50:50, and a
projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3.



- 52 -
G. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.13     ZCCM would be requested to submit to the Bank annual reports examined
by independent auditors acceptable to the Banlc within six months of the end of
the accounting year. In addition to the annual audit reports, ZCCM will
submit quarterly financial statements within 45 days after the end of each
quarter and monthly project progress reports and procurement status reports
within three weeks of the end of each month. Finally, within six months after
the closing date for the Project, ZCCM will prepare and furnish to the Bank a
completion report on the Project dealing with its implementation, and the
costs and benesfits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
H. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
7.14     The financial rate of return for the Project has been calculated on
an incremental basis in real terms.
7.15     The basis of the Project is that, without a rehabilitation program,
output even from viable and competitive operations would continue to go down,
as it has in the past. As mentioned (paras. 2.02 and 3.12), copper production
declined from 709,500 tonnes in 1974 to 575,500 tonnes in 1983, a decrease of
2.3% per annum. The drop has been steeper during 1978-83, from 654,000 tonnes
in 1978 to 575,500 tonnes in 1983, a decrease of 2.5% per annum. The
difficulty is obviously to estimate the levels of production, should the
five-year rehabilitation program not be carried out, not only because for a
project of this nature there is bound to be some arbitrariness in the
production levels chosen, but also because of the repercussions on ZCCM's
finances, and on Zambia's balance of payments and creditworthiness, and
ultimately its social stability. The main assumption made here is that,
should the Project not be implemented, ZCCM copper production would continue
to decrease involuntarily at 2.5% per annum during 1985-89, to about 502,000
tonnes in 1989 (excluding the TL3 plant)'. This percentage (2.5% per annum) is
considered realistic, considering ZCCM's past production performance under
similar conditions.
7.16     The cost and benefit streams have been prepared on the basis of the
financial projections presented, and are given in Annex 7-5. Based on these
assumptions, the incremental financial rate of- return is 21% before taxes and
15% after taxes.
7.17     Sensitivity Tests.  As could be expected from such an incremental
analysis, the return is mostly sensitive to the assumption made on the
percentage decline in production expected should the Project not be
implemented.  Should this percentage vary from 2.5% per annum to 2% per annum,
the return decreases from 20% to 10%, demonstrating both the financial risks
of the Project: and the limited validity of an incremental analysis when
applied to a project of this nature. The return is less sensitive to copper
price variations, operating costs or investment costs as shown in the table
below.

Copper revenues down 10%                     11.1
I. Major Risks
7.18     The technical risks to the Project are small.  The rehabilitation and
replacement component is relatively straightforward in terms of technical
design, and operation; it forms part of ZCCM's recurrent investment needs and
has taken adequately into account on-going operating arrangements.
7.19     As discussed in Chapter IV, while ZCCM is not expected to encounter
difficulties in marketing its copper production, it cannot be excluded that
copper prices may not rise in real terms as has been assumed in the base case
analysis in this report, and that there may be reductions in ZCCM's revenues
in individual years, posing financial risks to the Project. As mentioned
(para. 4.08), future copper prices projections are subject to considerable
uncertainty. However, most market experts tend to expect real price
improvements, thus permitting a marked improvement in ZCCM's finances over the
next three years. In the longer term, adjustments to the parity of the kwacha
will to a laige extent, influence the ability of the Company to sustain itself
financially. The Project is not expected to influence the general level of
copper prices, as ZCCM is expected to maintain its present share of around 10%
of estimated international copper market.
7.20     As indicated above, the principal financial risk facing the Project
is the possibility of insufficient or untimely availability of internally
generated cash for equity financing to complete the Project. Internally
generated cash may not be available, because: (i) it has not materialized,
mostly on account of low copper prices; or (ii) requirements for the
rehabilitation of ZCCM facilities cannot be met because of competing other
ZCCM investment on new major projects. The risk of the first case is low, to
the extent that ZCCM's equity contribution to the Project will represent only
about half of projected internal cash generation during the two-and-a-half
years duration of the Project. Other measures taken to help ZCCM cope with
insufficient cash generation are the annual review of expenditures and
revenues through Project Completion and the preparation of five-year financial
projections which would permit early identification of cash shortfalls; and
the Government cost overrun guarantee particularly in local currency. To
reduce the risk of the second case, i.e., competition with other investments,
the Bank's approval would be requested on: (i) new investments, in addition to
the already approved investment program, including the Project, in any year
higher than US$30 million through Project Completion; and (ii) the production



- 54 -
and investment program prepared after completion of the technical studies.
Another financial risk is related to the insufficient provision of foreign
exchange to ZCCM, not only because ZCCM's ability to produce is dependent on
timely availability of foreign exchange, but also Zambia's foreign exchange
earning capability is linked to ZCCM's production levels. To reduce this
risk, the Government and ZCCM would be requested to agree each year on the
amounts of foreign exchange that should be made available to run ZCCM's
operations efficiently.
7.21     There is also a managerial risk in the Project.  The success of the
rehabilitation project depends heavily on the management, whose task is not
only to implement the Project successfully but also to correct past practices
that have in part led to the present situation. As already discussed, the
Company's top structure was reorganized, and should provide for steady
improvement in ZCCM's management, and for the successful introduction of cost
effective production methods. Finally, the Project's success depends heavily
on the Government's and ZCCM's commitment to transform the agreed upon
long-term objectives in a consistent action program which implements even
unpopular but economically justified decisions. To limit the managerial risk
and Bank exposure, disbursement of the second tranche is conditioned on
implementation of the agreed action program.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01     The Project is an important element of the Government policy
objective to improve Zambia's balance of payments through continuing export
and foreign exchange earnings.  Improvements in ZCCM's ability to generate
foreign exchange are essential to assist the Government's investment efforts
in non-copper activities, and to support its strategy of diversification of
its economic structure.  ZCCG  is expected to generate in current terms a total
of K 10.4 billion, or US$6.5 billion gross foreign exchange over the next five
years (or US$1.3 billion, per annum on the average) which is expected to
continue to represent over 95% of the country's foreign exchange earnings. On
a net basis, the net foreign inflow would amount to K 5.8 million (US$3.6
billion) over the next five years, (or US$0.7 billion per annum on the
average), after taking into account on the one hand foreign loan take-ups
(USIO.9 billion), and, on the other, foreign exchange expenditures for capital
investments (US$0.6 billion), operating costs (US$2.3 billion), and debt
servicing (US$0.9 billion).
A. Economic Rate of Return
8.02     The economic rate of return of the Project has been calculated in
real terms, on an incremental basis based on the streams given in Annex 8-1.
The economic cost and benefit streams are measured from the viewpoint of the
economy as a whole, and have been adjusted to reflect distortions in the
market prices of the project inputs and outputs. They have been based on the
same assumptions used for the financial return, except for the exclusion of
all identifiable taxes, and for the application of conversion factors of (i)
0.67 to skilled and semi-skilled labor; (ii) 0.91 to capital equipment and
stores; (iii) 0.61 to fuel; and (iv) 0.96 to all other foreign exchange costs
and benefits, to reflect foreign trade distortions caused by import tariffs,
export taxes and subsidies, as well as other forms of trade restrictions and



- 55 -
incentives. As expected for a project of this nature, the economic rate of
return is high at 36%. As in the case of the financial return, the economic
return is most sensitive to the basic assumption made on the effect of the
Project on production levels. Should the Project prevent a drop in production
of only 2% per annum during 1984-88, instead of 2.5% per annum, the return
would still be high at 22%. It would decrease to 11%, should the drop in
production during 1984-88 be 1.5% per annum without the Project. As the
financial return, the economic return is less sensitive to variations in
revenues, operating costs, and investment costs.
B. Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.03     The foreign exchange benefits of the Project are high since ZCCM
generates 100% foreign exchange from export sales of copper, cobalt, lead and
zinc, and only a fraction of its cost, in addition to the service of foreign
debt, is in foreign exchange.
8.04     Incremental foreign exchange benefits have been calculated based on
the streams for the incremental financial rate of return plus debt-service on
foreign financing for ZCCM.  Revenues have been calculated as 100% foreign
exchange, as all incremental production will be exported. The foreign
exchange portion of operations and capital costs include the direct and
indirect foreign exchange costs. The total foreign exchange portion for
operating and capital costs are about 47% and 75%, respectively. The
resulting incremental net foreign exchange benefits of the Project are
considerable, averaging K 70 million per annum (US$44 million) in current
terms over the next five years (Annex 8-2).
C. Other Benefits
8.05     Other macro-economic benefits are the financial revenues which will
accrue to the Government (income and other taxes). On the basis of the
present taxation system, during the 1984-88 period, ZCCM is expected to pay
about K 1.6 billion (US$l billion) in direct and indirect taxes, or US$0.2
billion per annum, of which US$0.5 billion in export tax, US$o.1 billion in
equity levy and mineral and income taxes and US$0.4 billion in taxes on
imported equipment spares and stores.
8.06     As a part of the institution building effort, training programs will
be instituted for ZCCM. The unquantifiable economic benefits of training as
well as of the technical studies add to the attractiveness of the Project.
Finally, the Bank will be working closely with ZCCM to help prepare a sound
investment program for the copper industry in Zambia.

suitable for a Bank loan to the Government of Zambia of US$75 million
equivalent for a period of 20 years, including five years' grace, to be
on-lent to ZCCM for 15 years, including three years' grace. The equipment
and spare parts category of the proposed loan would be divided into two
tranches of US$40 million and US$30 million each. The second tranche would
only be released after certain actions presented in para. 6.12 have taken
place. Retroactive financing up to US$0.4 million is recommended for the
technical studies.

ZAMBIA - EXPORT REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
ZCCM - MANPOWER AND TRAINING
1.        By the end of 1964, just after independence, the mining industry
employed 7,816 expatriates in jobs ranging from partly-skilled to the
highest professional and managerial levels. The African labor force was
41,000 of whom 70% were illiterate, 20% had completed primary schooling,
and only 5% had any formal secondary education. There was one Zambian
graduate employed by the mining industry, and in the whole country there
were only 108 graduates and 1,200 Zambians with secondary school
certificates. There were no Zambian artisans employed at that time.
2.        From 1964, expatriates were no longer regarded as a permanent
feature of the mining industry, but as expatriates who would supply their
skills and experience only for so long as these could not be provided
locally. Training of Zambians became a normal part of an expatriate's job,
which was based on fixed period contracts--normally of three years'
duration. The effect of this change was a sharp rise in expatriate
turnover which was the first major set-back with respect to the problem of
maintaining an adequate level of skilled manpower in the industry--expatri-
ates were leaving before sufficient numbers of Zambians had been trained.
3.        Substantial progress was made between 1964 and 1970 towards
Zambianizing administrative, operative and the lower level supervisory
jobs. By the end of 1970, the expatriate labor force had been reduced by
40% from 7,816 to 4,714, while the Zambian labor force had increased from
41,031 to 46,314. Many of these Zambians were occupying positions in the
mining, metallurgical and engineering sections formerly held by
expatriates. The industry's manning structure had been radically altered
to allow the employment of semi-skilled Zambians and clear progression
routes to high-level jobs were outlined for employees with potential. At
the same time, the industry's training programs had moved away from basic
literacy training towards the provision of increasingly advanced job
skills. However, because of critical shortage of school leavers with the
grounding in mathematics and science essential for advanced technical
training, there had been a marked failure in the industry's efforts to
train Zambians to take over jobs with a high technical content.
4.        By the end of 1970, Zambia's massive investment in education had
produced an almost complete infrastructure of secondary and tertiary
institutions, and there was a dramatic expansion in the number of school
leavers. At the IJniversity of Zambia, the mining companies began awarding
scholarships and supplementations to staff salaries in the Schools of Mines
and Engineering. Below graduate level, the Technical Colleges were
concentrating their efforts on mining, metallurgical, engineering and
accountancy training, with the mining industry as the major sponsor.
Within the industry, emphasis was moving away from training employees to
fill semi-skilled production and supervisory posts to training of



- 63 -                         ANNEX 3-5
Page 2 of 8
candidates requiring a higher level of educational, technical and
professional skills such as technicians, technologists, surveyors,
ventilation officers, accountants and computer programers.
5.        The main objective of the recent period was to equip Zambians to
fill technical and professional posts by using the national educational
system. Despite the smallness of the pool from which suitable candidates
can be drawn, the industry scholarship program has significantly increased
the number of Zambians in the high technical and professional posts. From
the single graduate of 1964, there are now 456 of whom 177 hold degrees in
mining/geology, metallurgy/chemistry and engineering. The career
development patterns of these graduates amply demonstrate their ability.
In the mining sector, there were 3 Underground Managers and 11 Assistant
Underground Managers at the end of 1979. In the metallurgical sector, 2
Assistant Plant Superintendents and 6 Plant Metallurgists have been
appointed and there were 27 Metallurgical Engineers.
6.        The emphasis placed on the training of artisans has enabled the
industry to make substantial inroads into what was the largest area of
dependence on expatriates and there are now 1,800 Zambian artisans and
technicians. Despite the achievements of the last six years, however,
there are still about 2,000 expatriates employed in the industry; the bulk
of whom are in the engineering sector. Although they now represent only
3.5% of th-A nc!uwstr''s total labor force as against 16% in 1964, the rate
at which they are being replaced has fallen from an annual average of 7% in
the 1964-70 period to 2.5% during the last six years. This trend reflects
the longer education and training time which is required to fill higher-
level technical posts together with the industry's natural development
which has led to the creation of a substantial number of newtechnical jobs
which can initially be filled only by recruitment of expatriates.
7.        The most recent (December 1982) estimates of shortfall for
complete Zambianization in the technical and administrative fields in
relation to authorized and established posts are:
Graduate engineers                  950
Technicians                       1,091
Accountants                          114
Management services                   64
Artisans                            907
Total Shortfall                3,126

II. ORGANIZATION FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
8.         In May 1972, the Mining Industry Manpower Services Unit (MIMSU)
was established with the objectives:
(i)  to determine the demand for Zambian technical,
professional and managerial manpower;
(ii)  to determine the most efficient and effective
means of producing the required number of trained
Zambians to fill expatriate-held jobs;
(iii) to ensure that national and industry selection,
training and career development programs meet the
industry's qualitative and quantitative skill
requirements; and
(iv)  to coordinate and monitor the industry's
Zambianization program, to ensure that government
and industry policies are successfully implemented
and trained Zambian manpower properly utilized.
MIMSU prevously coordinated the activities of the two main companies, NCCM
and RCM. The effect on MIMSU by the merger between RCM and NCCM into ZCCM
was a strengthening of the Unit and a change of name to Eduction and
Training Unit (ETU). The organization chart is shown on page 5 and the ETU
Communication Network on page 6.
9.        The Directorate has two main divisions:
A.  Manpower Planning and Zambianization and Recruitment Unit
(STADRU) with the objectives:
(i)  to Zambianize the mining industry in the shortest
possible time commensurate with maintaining
production and safety standards;
(ii)  to identify the mining industry's future
requirements for high level manpower in terms of
numbers, occupations and skill levels;
(iii) to reduce labor costs by improving manpower
utilization; and
(iv)  to make manpower policy proposals to the
respective boards of the mining companies and
Government with respect to Zambianization and
manpower utilization.



- 65 -                        ANNEX 3-5
Page 4 of 8
This unit has five subdivisions:
- Manpower Planning and Information;
- Staff Development
- Medical Training;
- Psychological and Assessment Services;
- Recruitment and Placement
- Graduate Affairs.
B. Education and Training Unit (ETU) which coordinates
activities within the mining industry provides an advisory service on
training to head offices and to divisions and fulfills a number of
centralized training functions which are more economically carried out
centrally than at individual divisions. These training activities are
designed to meet the industry's Zambianization Program and develop staff to
meet the production and efficiency targets set by the industry. The
Superintendent (Technical Training) has responsibility for liaison and
coordination of training matters with the assistant personnel managers
(Manpower & Training), as well as rationalizing certification in the
industry in accordance with the legal authority conferred on ETU management
under the Technical and Vocational Training Act 1972. The ETU has ten
subdivisions:
- Mining Training
- Management and Supervisory Training
- Management Services Training
-  Scholarships and Bursaries Administration
- Metallurgy Training
- Engineering Training
- CSD Training Services
- Education Projects Section
- Materials Management Training
- Skills Analysis
10.       The Manpower Development and Training Organization is comprehen-
sive and inclades training at all levels and categories of staff. It is
fully integrated in the Government's overall policies and plans for
manpower development and fully coordinated with the Government's formal
education and training institutions. The total number of staff that
received training in 1980 was about 15,400 in more than 120 different
courses utilizing 76 training centers within the industry and a number of
governmental educational institutions. The ETU organization has a staff of
105 and divisional training staff is 376 (1981). The total yearly cost for
training in the mining industry was estimated at K 20 million out of which
the ETU itself was allocated about K 7.3 million (1981).
11.       As a result of declining copper prices on the world market,
increased prices of energy and increased cost and gradually decreased
availability of qualified and experienced expatriate staff for the mining
industry, the MIMSU has realized an increasing need to extend its local
training activities. Financial constraints have, however, forced a
decrease of budgetary allocations to ETU. The ETU budget grew from K 3.2



- 66 -                         ANNEX 3-5
Page 5 of 8
million in 1975/76 to K 7.3 million in 1980/81. Estimated requirements for
training in 1981/82 was K 9.1 million which had to be cut to K 7.5 million.
12.       The development and expansion of local training facilities for
engineers, technicians and craftsmen has been successful in terms of
professional quality and has reduced total training costs considerably.
The only shortcoming is the lower degree of the locally trained staff's
international outlook, experience and cooperation, which is considered
important within an industry, almost exclusively depending on external
supply of its processing plants and external markets for its products. ETU
has therefore designed a program for short in-service training courses or
attachment to industries abroad for locally trained technical and
managerial staff after some years of successful service. It is estimated
that 60 Zambian technical staff should have this overseas training
annually. Local funding, external industry, bilateral donors, etc. can
assist with about 30 fellowships per annum.
13.       Finally, ETU has an extensive ongoing management training program
for supervisory staff from junior supervisors to top management. In the
period March 1980 - September 1981, 799 people were trained ir 67 different
courses including all aspects of supervisory work, financing, budgeting,
and communication skills.  A new  Cost Reduction Program  has been
successfully introduced in two mine divisions and ETU plans to introduce
the new program for the whole mining industry. The program is a series of
on-the-job workshops and inter-actions between higher divisional management
with the intention to implement cost reduction stategies at all levels of
operations. Staffing constraints and lack of recurrent funds for the
important expansion have delayed the implementation of the program and
financial assistance is therefore included in the project. The following
assistance for three years is needed:

14.       During the 1970s, the local training of technicians developed
rapidly. The resources are the Northern Technical College (NORTEC) in
Ndola and Zambia Institute of Technology (ZIT) in Kitwe. The ZIT was
founded in 1970 and was set-up in close collaboration with the mining
industry. The Mining Department of ZIT is exclusively working for the
benefit of the mining industry through ETU, which in addition to providing
sponsorships for trainees, equipment for the workshops and laboratories,
also provides staff for lecturing and instruction. The Mining Department
offers certificate and diploma courses in mining, metallurgy, surveying and
ventilation. The output of these courses varies between 30-40, an
inadequate number in relation to requirements (para. 7). As physical
facilities - classrooms, workshops, laboratories, students' hostels, etc. -
are already available at ZIT, an expansion of the program would only
require more staff and equipment/materials for the practical work. ETU and
ZIT have planned an increased course program to provide for an enrollment
of about 300 students and an output of 120-150 technicians/technologists
per year. Some new programs started during 1982, but most of the extended
programs will start in 1983.

15.       Training at the School of Mines (SOM) at UNZA.  The school was
established in 1972 and has developed from an enrollment of 31 in 1973-74
to 184 in 1981-82 and from an output of 3 in 1973-74 to around 30 in
1982-82. The school is established through financial assistance from SIDA
and has a capacity of 200-250 students with a potential output of 50
engineers per year.  ETU sponsors most of the students and contributes to
staff salary costs and to the students' fieLd programs. The main
constraints for developing full capacity at the SOM are difficulties in
recruiting qualified and experienced staff and insufficient recurrent
budgetary allocations.
16.       In addition to sponsoring approximately 700 students per year to
external institutions for full-time education, the mining industry provides
education and training facilities for in-service courses to a wide variety
of job occupations. During any one month, over 1,500 employees undergo
some form of training and/or education. More than 120 different courses in
education and training are offered in 70 difEferent training centers within
the mining industry, and utilizing the governmental technical colleges, the
trade training institutes and the university. The most urgent need in
manpower development at the craftsman level is in the electrical and plant
fitter categories. ETU plans to reactivate either the Kitwe Apprentice
School or the Nkana Mechnaic School. These schools would need staffing,
equipment and hostel facilities. Another urgent need in the same category
of training is a specialist welding program to be organized in-service at
the existing ETU Kitwe Trades Training Institute. This course would
require new equipment and materials for a three-year program of short
courses.

THE COPPER MARKET
A. Reserves and Production
1.        World1/ proven copper reserves are estimated at 500 million
tonnes, of which 6% (30 million tonnes) are found in Zambia. Other important
countries are Chile (20%), TJSA (19%), Peru (7%), Canada (7%) and Zaire (5%).
Total copper resources are estimated at 2 billion tonnes, including 0.9
billion tonnes in seabed nodules. Most copper deposits in North America have
ore grades between 0.5% and 1.5%, whereas there are many in Africa and Latin
America with grades from 2% to 3%. Zambian ore grades presently average
3.1%. Copper ore bodies contain other minerals and copper is generally
produced along with valuable co-products or by-products, including gold,
silver, cobalt, molybdenum, lead and zinc. In Zambia, the main by-product is
cobalt. Small amounts of silver, selenium and gold are also recovered.
2.        The supply of copper comes from two sources--mine, known as primary
production (85%) and scrap, known as secondary recovery (15%). The USA (23%)
and Canada (11%), together with five developing countries namely Chile (16%),
Zambia (9%), Zaire (8%), Peru (5%) and Philippines (5%), supplied 77% of
world mine production of 6.6 million tonnes in 1981. From 1960-70, world
mine production increased at an annual rate of 3.6%, but growth slackened to
1.7% per year from 1970 to 1980. During the 1970's, the developing
countries' share of mine production increased from 51% to 61%, and a
structural shift occurred in mine production away from the industrialized
countries where production actually declined. The largest reduction was in
the USA where mine production declined from 1.56 million tonnes in 1970 to
1.18 million tonnes in 1980. LDC production growth occurred in the early
1970s in large new mines in emerging copper producers, for example, Papua New
Guinea and Indonesia, and in the mid-late 1970s in well-established copper
producers, including Chile, Peru and the Philippines. Zambia was the world's
second largest producer, after the USA, in 1960. But production has
stagnated and today Zambia is the fourth largest producer. From 1960 to
1981, Zambia's share of world mine production has decreased from 16% to 9% as
shown below:

3.         While the majority of copper mine production is located in
developing countries, most refined production takes place in proximity to
major users in the industrialized countries as shown in the following table.
Europe, Japan and the USA accounted for 66% cf world refined production in
1981. But, refined production in industrialized countries increased only
marginally from 1970-80 compared with strong growth in developing countries.
The largest LDC refined producers are Chile and Zambia which accounted for
33% and 24 % of total LDC refined production in 1981. Secondary production
from recovered scrap takes place almost entirely in the industrialized
countries.  It is very responsive to changes in supply/demand and
price--increasing to as high as 18-20% of refined copper supply during
periods of high prices and supply shortages and contracting to 10-12% during
periods of low prices and supply surpluses.

4.         In 1981, about 65% of world copper production was traded at
different stages in the production chain mostly from LDC producers to
industralized countries users as shown in the following table. In 1981, the
major importers were the USA, Europe and Japan, while Chile, Canada, Zambia
and Zaire led the copper export countries. About 83% of developing
countries' copper was exported in 1981. Developing countries' exports
consisted of ores and concentrates (29%), blister and anode copper (21%) and
refined copper (50%). For Zambia, 99.8% of production is for export almost
entirely in the form of refined copper with 0.2% being retained for domestic
consumption. Zambia's share of world exports declined from 19% in 1961 to
12% in 1981.  In addition to imports from LDCs, industrialized countries also
import 20,000-50,000 tpy copper from Centrally Planned Economies.

B. Production Costs
5.         Production cost estimates for individual producers at any
particular time must be approached with caution as they can be strongly
influenced by many varied factors including product mix, by-product prices,
exchange rate movements, production level decisions, differential inflation
in different cost factors, interest rates and extraordinary credits/charges.
Furthermore, during depressed periods producers will frequently endeavor to
minimize costs for limited periods by delaying maintenance, cutting back on
high-cost production units and high-grading ore bodies where possible.
Having noted these qualifications, estimates for refined copper production
costs (including taxes, interest and by-product credits, but excluding
depreciation) indicate that cash production costs for copper increased
strongly during the late 1970s to US$0.77 per lb in 1981. Since then,
however, costs have declined reflecting a combination of austerity measures
by producers in the face of low prices and closure of high cost units because
of large over-supply in the industry.

6.        The higher-cost producers tend to have lower ore grades, higher
labor costs and greater regulation and environmental protection requirements
than for low-cost producers. Figure 4-1 provides a graph of estimated 1982
production costs for cumulative world refined copper production on the basis
of (i) net cash operating costs; and (ii) total production costs including
depreciation and amortization.  It should be noted that both costs include
interest charges and allowances for by-product and co-product credits.  Costs
ranged from US$0.50-0.60 per lb for several low-cost developing country
operations in Latin America and the Pacific Basin to US$0.85-1.00 for
high-cost producers in Japan, Australia, Europe and North America.
C. Consumption
7.        In 1981 the US (29%), Europe (32%) and Japan (18%) consumed 79% of
world refined copper. Several developing countries, including Brazil,
Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and India are small but important consumers of
refined copper.  Copper consumption increased at just over 4% per year from

1960 to 1970 for industrialized countries and at 5.5% per year for developing
countries.  From 1970 to 1980, consumption growth dropped to 1.3% per year in
industrialized countries, but increased to 8.4% per year in developing
countries, as industrial production growth and copper consumption were less
affected by economic vicissitudes in LDCs. However, since 1980 consumption
has also lagged in developing countries.

8.         Half of copper consumption takes place in the electrical sector,
which consists of electric equipment and supplies, telecommunications
equipment, power cable, electrical wire, electronics equipment, control
systems, etc. Other important sectors are construction (14%), machinery
(20%) and transportation (10%). Shifts in the end use of copper appear to
vary between different countries (table below). For example, in Western
Europe the share of electrical sector has been stable in the last decade, but
it increased in the USA while decreasing in Japan. On an aggregate basis
however the shares have been relatively stable over the last decade.

10.       The decline in intensity of use reflects improved applications,
such as increased carrying capacity of message volume per unit of cross
sectional area of conventional cable, reduction in copper weight per
manufactured unit, e.g., smaller, lighter cars requiring less copper per
automobile than previously, and substitution from competing materials

D. Supply/Demand Balance and Inventories
12.       The copper market is subject to sharp fluctuations in supply and
demand and has been characterized historically by four-to-five year cycles of
growth and decline. There is a three-to-four month lag between changes in
demand and changes in supply.  Because of this response lag, there are supply
surpluses and inventory accumulation during demand downturns.
Correspondingly, there are inventory rundowns and supply shortages during
market booms. The downturns are generally characterized by high inventories
and excess capacity and the upturns by declining inventories and capacity
shortages. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the copper market followed the
traditional cyclical pattern of four-to-five year peaks and troughs.  But
following the oil crisis of 1974, there was an unusually severe slump
initially due to a collapse in demand but subsequently prolonged by over-
production, especially by some of the LDC producers. Several developing
countries kept up strong production and a large inventory build-up occurred
with reported inventories reaching a peak in 1977 of over 1.9 million
tonnes--between two to three times normal levels. Subsequently sharp



- 83 -                          ANNEX 4-1
Page 10 of 19
production cutbacks, especially by North American producers, combined with
modest consumption growth, resulted in inventories declining to near normal
levels of about four weeks' supply and in 1979/80 a modest boom occurred.
The upward trend, however, has been reversed by the economic recession of
1980/81 and in 1981, consumption was only 4% higher than in 1973. Over the
same period, however, production capacity increased by nearly 2.0 million
tonnes largely as a result of the completion of projects conceived in the
late 1960s and early 1970s when the copper market was stronger. The 1982
consumption level required a mine capacity utilization of only 78%--a very
low level even by the standards of the past decade. Faced by persistent and
increasing over-capacity during the past decade, many high cost mines
(included several with dwindling ore reserves) have closed in recent years
permanently removing about 0.5 million tpy mine capacity.  (Such capacity is
excluded from the end-1983 mine capacity estimate of 8.1 million tpy in the
table below). Other high cost producers have cut back or suspended
production because of the depressed market conditions and about 0.9 million
tpy mine capacity (of which three quarters are in North America) is reported
to have been placed on a care and maintenance basis.  Such temporary closures
include not only older mines but also new greenfield mines in North America
and elsewhere.

E. Future Demand Prospects
13.       The near-term prospects are for copper demand to recover from the
present low levels as the economies of the industrialized countries recover
from the economic recession. Depending on the timing and strength of the
next economic upturn, copper consumption in industrialized countries is
projected to rise to 6.20-6.32 million tonnes in 1985--an annual average
growth rate of 0.3-0.8% per year from 1980 to 1985, compared with 1.5% per
year from 1970 to 1980. For the developing countries, a stronger economic
growth trend is expected than in the industrialized countries and copper
consumption is projected to increase at 0.5-1.5% per year from 1.22 million
tonnes in 1980 to 1.25-1.31 million tonnes in 1985. While this growth is
higher than in the industrialized countries, it is significantly lower than
the 9.0% growth from 1970 to 1980, reflecting the economic difficulties of
several newly industrializing developing countries, such as Brazil and
Mexico, which are large LDC copper users.
14.       Longer-term demand prospects for copper in the mid- to late-1980s
and in the 1990s will be determined not only by economic growtlh but also by
several other factors, including substitution with competing materials,
changes in intensity of use of copper in different applications, the
availability of copper scrap and the development of new applications for
copper. Substitution trends from competing materials are expected to
influence future copper demand. Substitution has been effected in many of
the applications for which aluminum and plastics have a substantial
competitive edge over copper. However, further erosion of copper's market
share is still possible in terms of substituting aluminum in car radiators
and, possibly, in building wiring and substituting PVC in domestic water
systems. More recently, other materials have started to make inroads into
longstanding copper markets, such as fiber optics in telecommunications and
zinc for new coinage. If the accelerated substitution in these applications
does not taper, the copper consumption growth over the next decade could be
curtailed. Further, lower copper intensity of use is expected in the
communications industry and in the automobile industry which will tend to
reduce future growth rates in copper demand. Significant savings in copper
usage are likely to occur in the telecommunications industry associated with
copper-saving innovations such as the use of thinner gauge cables,
miniaturization of exchange equipment and increased use of microwave
communications. In the automotive industry, copper requirements per vehicle
are being reduced by the shift to small, lighter vehicles with reduced copper
requirements for radiators, electric motors and other components.
15.       The adverse effects of the various factors mentioned previously may
be partially mitigated by the accelerated development of new markets for
copper and major growth in certain existing applications. For new markets,
the use of solar energy for heating and air conditioning could require
60,000-150,000 tonnes per year in the USA alone. In the transport sector,
more prevalent use of electric vehicles could result in moderately
significant increases in copper use. Electric vehicles are expected to
require up to five times the amount of copper used in conventional
automobiles (about 30 kg.). For existing applications, desalinization
technology, is expected to be applied on a growing scale in various parts of
the world with substantial increases in copper requirements. Also, the

Page 12  of 19
requirement for fire sprinklers and other safety, security communication and
information and systems in new and renovated offices and houses should also
lead to increasing use of copper.
16.        Taking the various factors discussed above into account, three
demand scenarios have been developed on the basis of different economic
outlooks in which long term GDP growth is taken to be in the range 2.6-3.6%
per year for industrialized countries and 4.0-5.4% per year for developing
countries. In the low case, the economic difficulties of the mid-late 1970s
and early 1980s are assumed to persist in the future, and future economic
growth is assumed to be no better than the 1970s. In the high case, economic
growth rates for the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s are assumed to recover to the
levels of the 1960s and early 1970s. The medium case is in between the two
with a long term annual GDP growth of 3.1% for industrialized countries and
4.7% for LDCs. Based on these scenarios, long-term copper demand is
estimated to increase in the range 0.7-1.9% per year reaching 8.0 million
tonnes in 1995 in the low case and 9.2 million tonnes in the high case. Even
in the high case, copper consumption growth rates are well below pre-1974
levels (4.1% per year for industrialized countries and 7.3% for developing
countries from 1960 to 1974) because of intesnsity of use and substitution
effects noted previously.

F. Copper Supply Prospects
17.       Estimates of total net additional copper production capacity are
prepared by different industry sources based on information regarding new
projects and on copper company investment plans to (a) replace depleted
capacity and (b) develop incremental capacity. In normal circumstances,
fairly accurate capacity estimates can be made for the next three or four
years because once construction is underway, projects are generally
completed. However, capacity forecasts have been increasingly difficult to
make in recent years because the depressed copper market conditions have
resulted in persistent, unplanned cutbacks in capital expenditure, delays in
project execution for new projects as well as accelerated closures of high
cost units.
18.       Notwithstanding the basic difficulties of the international copper
industry, recent industry estimates indicate that there are a large number of
small projects that are presently under construction or that have a high
probability of being implemented on the next 5 to 10 years.  Such projects
generally have costs in the range of US$0.50-0.80 per lb (in 1983 terms) and
could provide an additional 1.5-2.0 million tpy capacity over the next
decade. Nearly half of these projects (about 0.8 million tpy capacity) would
be implemented to replace mines that are expected to close in the next ten
years due to depleted ore reserves. The balance would be net incremental
production from expansions and small greenfield projects to be found in many
countries - notably Chile, Peru, Papua New Guinea, Canada, Philippines and
Brazil. While progress without doubt will be influenced by prevailing prices
and market conditions, much of this capacity is expected to enter production
based partly on the expectation of higher future prices and partly on being
lower cost than other, existing high cost producers.
19.       It is expected that the proportion of secondary copper production
in total refined supply will increase slightly in the future. The
availability of "old scrap" (as opposed to new or circulating scrap) is a
function of earlier end usage of copper. Old scrap is recovered from
demolished buildings, scrapped cars and machinery, etc., at the end of the
useful life of the original application.  Thus, as the long-term trend in
copper consumption decelerates, the share of secondary copper in total
refined supply will tend to rise. Industry estimates indicate that secondary
copper production will increase from about 15% at present to 16-18% of copper
consumption by 1995.
20.       Given the outlook of very low demand growth (due to factors
discussed in para. 14) and continuing industry investment to provide
additional sources of supply to replace depleted mines and to provide
incremental capacity, future projections indicate that unless further
closures occur, excess capacity will persist at least through the early to
mid 1990s.  In the low case, noted below, the excess production capacity
remains at about 1.35-1.40 million tpy.  In the high case it is reduced to
about half that level by 1995.

These projections are also based on the assumptions that (i) 50,000 tpy net
imports of refined copper from CPEs continues from 1985 to 1995; (ii)
secondary production increases relative to primary as discussed above; and
(iii) maximum sustainable copper production is 90% of nominal capacity.
21.       The future copper supply/demand projections indicate that basic
changes in the industry's structure and invtestment pattern will be necessary
if capacity and demand are to be brought back into balance. Such a
restructuring would include, on the one hand, closure of high cost production
units (for example the capacity in Figure 4-1 with production costs above
US$0.90-1.00 per lb) and, on the other hand, more cautious investment
policies to replace old capacity/develop new capacity.
22.       As noted previously, there is presently about 0.9 million tpy of
industry capacity on a care and maintenance basis. Many high cost operations
were near to permanent closure in the late 1970s following the four years of
low prices for 1975-79. However, a large number of these operations were
effectively given a new lease of life by the relatively high copper prices of
1979 and 1980. While estimates of the timing and extent of the future shift
of capacity from temporary closure to permanent closure is at best highly
speculative, the market analysis would indicate that an increase in the rate
of permanent closures seems inevitable. Further, such closures will possibly
be found in countries with strong currencies such as the USA whose producers
are at a financial disadvantage with competiLtion from countries with weaker
currencies.
G. Copper Price Structure
23.       Virtually all the world's copper outside North America is traded at
the Lond,  '4otal Exchange (LME) price, or prices based on the LME price.  The
LME price is ;et    a twice datly basis and is extremely sensitive to changes
in supply/demand c iditi(-    -he price often fluctuates considerably from



- 88 -                          ANNEX 4-1
Page 15 of 19
quarter to quarter and from year to year, according to market conditions.
Since the LME price is actually set in pounds sterling, the price is also
subject to the influence of the dollar/sterling exchange rate when expressed
in dollar terms. When the pound strengthens against the dollar it has the
effect of somewhat increasing the LME price in dollar terms and vice versa
when the pound weakens against the dollar.
24.       The major exception to pricing based on the LME is found in the
USA where the major producers set their own "Producer" prices and where
merchants and traders buy and sell copper based on the Commodities Exchange
(COMEX) price. The COMEX price is closely linked to the LME price by
arbitrage and generally stays within a cent or two of the LME price. There
can be substantial differentials, however, between the US Producer price and
the LME price, especially during times of extreme price booms or slumps
because the US producers follow a more stable pricing policy than the LME
permits. Thus they will attempt to hold prices above the LME during price
slumps and will refrain from increasing prices as sharply as the LME during
price booms.
H. Past Price Trends
25.       Historically, copper prices have peaked and troughed with a
four-to-five year cycle following the underlying supply-demand conditions as
shown in Figure 4-2. Annual price data from the 1960-82 period indicate the
following characteristics of past copper price cycles.
(a) Periods of high prices generally last two years (namely
1965/66, 1969/70, 1973/74, 1979/80) whereas periods of
low prices can last from two to four years (1960/63,
1967/68, 1971/72, 1975/78). When prices change they
tend to change sharply and so that, on an annual price
data basis, periods of high prices are followed
directly by periods of low prices and vice versa; and
(b) Amplitude - The amplitude of the past three periods of
high prices and low prices is as follows:
Average LME Copper Price in Periods of High Prices and Low Prices
(US$ per pound - current terms)
Period       High Prices   Low Prices
1969/70          0.65
1971/72                         0.49
1973/74          0.87
1975/78                         0.60
1979/80          0.95
1981/82                         0.72
26.       The low prices in 1975/78 and 1981/82 are attributable to very
depressed copper market conditions as described in para. 11. The effects of
the underlying supply/demand balance have been accentuated, however, by the

strength of the dollar/sterling exchange rate, further depressing the LME
price in dollar currency terms.
I. Future Price Prospects
27.       Near-term price projections have been prepared for the next six
years, i.e., 1984-90 based on a continuation of price cycles broadly in line
with those from 1960-80. Given the very large inventories at end 1983 and
the persistence of substantial overcapacity, the Base Case (Realistic)
outlook is that the present period of low prices would last about four to
five years (1982-1986) and be followed by a relatively slow and weak upturn
in copper prices--which are projected to reach a peak of US$1.05-1.10 per lb
(in current terms) in 1988-1989. Alternative Low Case and High Case
projections have also been prepared. The Low Case follows the same price
cycle as the Realistic Case but the upswing is slower. This case is based on
the present period of low prices lasting five to six years rather than four
to five years. The High Case assumes a more responsive industry behavior to
present circumstances with accelerated closures, fewer new projects and less
aggressive production strategies. Prices turn up more quickly and are
US$0.10-0.15 per lb higher than the Realistic Case.
28.       The exact price projections for the three cases are shown in the
table following para. 30. To the extent that probabilities can be estimated,
it is considered that there is a probability of about 20% that the
pessimistic case will materialize and about 10% that the optimistic case will
come about, and hence a 70% chance that copper prices be anywhere in
between. Most likely, prices will be somewhere between the Low and Realistic
Cases. If the Realistic Case takes place, most producers will show
reasonable profits and very good profits for a small number. If the industry
moves more quickly than expected to readjust capacity and supply to demand
(and if demand is stronger than anticipated), prices could move up sharply as
in the High Case.  In this event the present copper inventories could be
insufficient to cushion the lag in production response and an apparent
shortage could arise--which could be further heightened by consumers
attempting to build copper inventories for an expected growth period. Under
such circumstances, prices could rise to average US$1.20 per lb (in current
terms) or higher in 1988, at which prices producers would make larger profits
which would help to compensate for the several prior years of poor financial
performance.
29.       From 1990 to 1995, copper prices have been projected on a long-term
trend basis and no attempt has been made to predict the timing or impact of
short-term cyclical factors. This equilibrium or trend price is based on the
cost of production, (i.e. cash operating costs plus financial charges) for a
combination of existing producers and incremental capacity. In the Low Case
price follows production costs for the lower cost producers which are
expected to be about US$0.60 per lb (in 1983 terms) in the early 1990s. In
the High Case price is closer to the estimated costs of expansions--which are
expected to be in the order of US$0.80 per lb (in 1983 terms) in the early
1990s.

30.       As noted previously, the price projection in 1995 is a long-run
equilibrium trend projection. Actual prices in any single year may vary
substantially from the trend according to prevailing market conditions. For
an individual year, prices might be expected to be within + 20% of the price
estimate with a 30% probability, + 35% with a 70% probability and + 45% with
a 90% probability in order of magnitude terms.

THE COBALT MARKET
A. Reserves and Production
1.         Cobalt is generally found in association with either copper or
nickel. Resesrves are highly concentrated in a small number of countries with
nearly 80% found in two countries, Zambia and Zaire. Other countries have
very small reserves and (with the exception of Morocco) much lower ore
grades, as shown below:

2.         In addition to land-based reserves, there are substantial seabed
deposits of cobalt contained in manganese nodules. These will become an
important source of cobalt when ocean floor mining commences probably in the
1990s.
3.         Mine production, like reserves, is highly concentrated among a
small number of countries. Historically, Zaire has been the predominant
cobalt producer supplying 50-60% of world mine production, and Zambia has
supplied about 10-15%.  In the 1950s and 1960s, almost all world1/ mine
production of cobalt came from only five countries--Zambia, Zaire, Canada,
Finland and Morocco. In the past decade, however, Australia, Philippines and
New Caledonia have also become noteworthy mine producers of cobalt as a
by-product of nickel production. Present world mining capacity is estimated
at about 35,000 tpy of contained cobalt of which about 50% is in Zaire, 15%
in Zambia and 35% in other countries. World mine production from 1950-81 is
shown below for selected years:

4.         Cobalt-bearing concentrates and matte are processed and refined
to produce cobalt metal. Of the largest mine producers, only Zaire, Zambia,
Canada and Finland have refineries to produce metal. For the other
producers, cobalt-bearing materials are shipped to Japan, Europe or North
America for refining. Most cobalt concentrates and mattes are relatively
complex and cobalt recovery can be as low as 25%. World metal production
capacity is estimated at 27,000 tpy. Cobalt materials can only be treated at
a very few facilities and long-term processing arrangements exist between
mines and refineries. For example, most concentrates from Australia and the
Philippines are refined in Japan, from New Caledonia and Morocco in France
and from Botswana in the USA. Cobalt-bearing mattes from Canada are refined
in Norway and the United Kingdom as well as Canada. Other producers of
refined metal are F.R. Germany and South Africa. In addition, Belgium
undertakes further processing of partially refined cobalt metal granules from
Zaire into various forms and compounds. The supply of cobalt metal is
directly impacted by acquisitions and disposals of the USA's strategic metals
stockpile. From 1949-61 annual cobalt metal purchases were made by the
General Services Administration to build up a strategic stockpile for the
USA. From 1963-76, stockpile disposals were made which supplemented the
availability of primary metal for consumption. The following table shows
primary cobalt metal production and supply, including adjustment for
stockpile purchases and disposals:

5.        The production of cobalt from secondary sources is not as large in
proportion to primary production as is common with many other metals. The
collection and separation processes are complex and expensive and prices have
not been sufficient to justify recovery in many applications. With the
exception of catalysts, cobalt consumed in non-metallurgical uses, such as
pigments and driers, is not recoverable. Most cobalt scrap originates from
high-temperature alloys with smaller quantities generated from magnets.
Limited data are available regarding scrap but estimates published for
1967-76 indicate that cobalt recovery was about 5% of world production in
that period. Estimates for the mid-1970s indicate that 65% was reclaimed in
Europe, (including 27% in France and 15% in F.R. Germany), 25% in Japan and
10% in the USA. A large part of the European recovery was from cobalt-bear-
materials exported from the USA. Cobalt recovery is reported to have
increased to nearly 9% of primary production in 1978 during a period of
extremely high prices which gave producers and fabricators of cobalt alloys
greater incentives to segregate their scrap by alloy type and re-melt it into
the same alloys. This segregation is costly and was not warranted in the
past. But secondary recovery has declined since in the face of a severe
market downturn.

B. Cobalt Production Costs
6.        Production costs for cobalt mining are extremely difficult to
estimate because cobalt is generally considered as "by-product credits" and
not assigned a specific mining cost. Processing costs can be more readily
identified, but even these can be complicated by the allocation of costs to
different metals produced. To the extent that estimates can be made, refined
metal production costs for existing producers are considered to be in the
range of US$4.00-6.00 per lb for Zaire and Zambia and US$5.00-10.00 per pound
for other producers (in 1982 terms) including all mining, processing,
transportation and delivery costs to European or American warehouses.
Incremental cash production costs are believed to be in the range of US$2.00-
6.00 per pound. New capacity under construction is expected to have costs
around the upper end of these ranges. A number of projects have been



ANNEX 4-2
- 97 -                           Page 5  of 15
identified in Africa, the Pacific and North America that might enter
production in the late 1980s. None of these have been sufficiently well
prepared to provide accurate production cost estimates, but they are expected
to be in the range US$10.00-15.00 per pound in 1982 terms.
C. Demand
7.        The heat-resistent, wear-resistant, magnetic and chemical
properties of cobalt make it a strategic metal, used mostly in high-
technology areas. End uses in the defense and aerospace industries as well
as strategic stockpiling by the USA underscore the importance of cobalt. A
description of the areas for cobalt demand is following:
(a) High Strength Alloys: Super-alloys contain from 10% to
65% cobalt and are essential for jet engines, rotor
blades and other parts which are subjected to stress at
high temperatures. Expansion of usage has occurred
recently in aircraft turbines, including power
generation applications;
(b) Magnets: Permanent magnets are widely used in the
electrical equipment industry. Because of their high
coercivity, cobalt-containing magnets are used in
telecommunications, magnetic couplings, meters,
loud-speakers, permanent magnet motors and repulsion
devices;
(c) Cutting Tools: Cobalt is used as a cement in the
manufacture of sintered tungsten carbide cutting tools
and other hard metal applications requiring very high
strength and abrasion resistance. Such applications,
which contain 10% to 15% cobalt, have grown steadily
with the automization of machine tools; and
(d)  Chemical:  Cobalt is a very powerful drier and has
important catalytical properties. Cobalt oxides and
organic compounds are used in paints, ceramics and
allied products as decolorizers, dyes, dryers, pigments
and oxidizers. They are also used in enamelling frit
and rubber to steel bonding applications. Cobalt
content of these compounds is in the range of 12% to
18%. Cobalt compounds are widely used as catalysts for
desulfurizing low-grade crude oil and in the
manufacture of polyester fibers.
8.        Cobalt metal is generally marketed in cathode form, although it is
also produced in powder form and some low-grade material is in the form of
thins, peelers and fines. Chemicals are marketed in the form of salts and
compounds. Super-alloys require very high-quality cobalt metal. For



ANNEX 4-2
- 98 -                         Page 6  of 15
example, vacuum super-alloys have the highest quality specification
permitting less than 1 part per million (ppm) lead, zinc, cadmium and less
than 3 ppm antimony.  Cutting tools require medium-grade cobalt and magnets
and chemicals can utilize low-grade cobalt with greater than 70 ppm lead and
zinc in some applications.  The shift in market shares has increased the
requirement for very high-grade cathode and has increased the proportion of
cobalt required in chemical rather than metallic form.
9.        Historically, magnet applications have accounted for most cobalt
consumption, accounting for up to 60% of cobalt requirements in Japan and 25%
in other countries. During the past two decades, however, chemicals and
super-alloys have grown in importance and together now account for over 70%
of total cobalt consumed, as shown below:

10.       Traditionally, cobalt has been prone to substitution in the
magnetic applications and the decline in magnet share of consumption,
especially in the 1970s, is the result of substitution by various competing
materials, including nickel, platinum, barium, strontium, ferrite and iron.
For some magnets, cobalt has been completely replaced by alternative
materials. Cobalt is also prone--though to a much lesser degree--to substi-
tution in other applications. For example, nickel is a potential substitute
in many sectors, including aircraft engine applications, machinery and
cutting tools and in catalysts. Tungsten and molybdenum carbide and ceramics
also substitute in cutting tools and other hard metal applications, and
chromium and manganese can be substituted in paints.  In these non-magnetic
uses, however, cobalt content is only likely to be reduced, not eliminated.

D. Consumption
11.       Consumption data is not collected on a regular basis by any
centralized group and estimates are only available on a perceived basis from
several separate sources. Further, the data sources do not carefully specify
whether data is for end-use consumption or for deliveries to consumers. The
statistics in this section, especially for recent years, should be viewed
therefore as indicative, rather than as firm data. According to available
estimates, about 90% of market economies' conSumption takes place in the
industrialized countries. The USA accounts for about 40% of consumption,
Western Europe about 35% (including the United Kingdom, 12% and F.R. Germany,
10%), and Japan about 15%. From 1950 to 1970, cobalt consumption as
estimated increased at an annual average growth rate of 6.3%. However,
consumption growth peaked in 1973/74 and during the recession of 1980/81,
consumption fell back to the levels of the late 1960s. The recent fall in
cobalt consumption was associated with reduced activities of end users plus a
decline in intensity of use in different cobalt uses and substitution away
from cobalt. The following presents a history of cobalt consumption.2/
2/  Consumption statistics are not available for CPEs, but annual consumption
is estimated at 3,000-4,000 tpy, most of which is supplied by domestic
production in the USSR and by exports fromi Cuba to other CPEs. Net
imports of CPEs from Market Economies are estimated at a maximum of
several hundred tpy. Such imports often occur through government-to-
government trade, aid and barter agreements.

E.  Supply, Demand and Inventories
12.       The cobalt market as has an inbuilt tendency towards a
supply/demand imbalance because of the structure of the market. Demand is
highly responsive to short-term business cycle conditions and can change
sharply from year to year. Cobalt market cycles have occurred almost every
four-to-five years over the past three decades (with peaks in 1952, 1957,
1961, 1966, 1969, 1974, and 1977). During the upturn, consumption increases
by as much as 14% per year for a period of two-to-four years. On the
downside, the sensitivity of consumption to business cycles has steadily
increased over the past decades. The average decline from the peak year to
the trough year has increased from 7% in the 1960s to over 30% in the 1970s.

13.       Cobalt supply, on the other hand, is largely determined by copper
and nickel production decisions and is thus relatively unresponsive to cobalt
demand conditions. In times of depressed demand, producers must either place
their cobalt production on the market or stockpile it in some type of
concentrated or metallic form.  Zaire, the dominant producer in the market,
has some capability to shift cobalt production between mining areas with
different ore grades, but even so, production can only be moved upwards or
downwards within a fairly narrow range. In the 1950s and 1960s, Zaire was
able to keep world supply and demand roughly in balance through a combination
of production, inventory and price adjustments.  But, as the market has
increased, Zaire's ability to adjust for shortages and surpluses has been
eroded by increasingly volatile demand and by the growing presence of smaller
suppliers. In particular, the establishment of production in Japan in the
late 1970s has resulted in the relatively large increase in the supply of
material available to the free market through non-producer channels.
14.       In the mid-to-late 1970s, the cobalt market became very unstable as
the tendencies towards imbalance became more pronounced, and in 1978 a period
of severe boom and bust occurred. At that time there was an uprising in
Shaba province in Zaire and, concerned about the continuity of cobalt
supplies, consumers scrambled to build up their cobalt inventories. Orders
for cobalt greatly exceeded supplies in the market place and Zaire introduced
a quota system for allocating available cobalt to consumers.  In response to
the apparent shortage, various short-term measures were taken including Zaire
and Zambia air-freighting cobalt to Europe to minimize transportation delays,
refineries increasing the recovery and recycling of cobalt scrap and various
users substituting away from cobalt, especially in magnet applications.
15.       The cobalt market contracted and demand declined sharply in 1980
and 1981 as the industrialized countries entered a deep recession following
the oil price rise and as substitution away from cobalt took effect. By
1980, many consumers found that they had over-reacted to the 1978 shortages
and were faced with large inventories and a sharply contracting demand. In
the face of high interest rates, consumers started to meet requirements from
inventories and shipments were cut back sharply, the brunt of the cutback ,
falling on Zaire and Zambia. By the end of 1981, producer inventories were
estimated to be about one year's supply. Production and consumption
estimates are not yet available for 1982, but it is likely that inventories
will have further increased.

F. Capacity Requirements and Prospects
16.       World cobalt metal production capacity is presently 10,000-12,000
tons greater than consumption. In addition, new production capacity was
initiated following the supply shortages of 1977-79. Expansion projects
presently under construction in Zambia and South Africa will add about 3,000
tonnes of new capacity by 1985. Additional projects which could be
implemented if required in other countries such as Canada and the USA, New
Caledonia, Indonesia and the Philippines, could add further production
capacity in the late 1980s.
17.       As noted previously, cobalt demand is highly responsive to business
cycle conditions in the short term. The recovery of cobalt demand in the
next two-to-three years will thus be closely allied to the next economic
upturn in the industrialized economies. Cobalt consumption as reported in
1981 is considered to be about 20% below what might be characterized as a
normal or equilibrium level of demand. Using the reported consumption
19,000 tonnes in 1980 as a base year, a cobalt consumption of 21,000-23,000
tonnes is estimated in 1985--which would be around the peak of the next
short-term business cycle.
18.       No attempt is made to estimate specific short-term cycles for 1990
or beyond. Rather, a long-term trend is used to project demand. Annual
consumption in any one year may be plus or minus 30% of this trend, depending
on market circumstances. This longer-term demand trend depends not only on
economic growth trends, but also evolving substitution and recycling trends.
For the foreseeable future, little additional substitution is expected
against cobalt and, given the large oversupply situation, some reverse
substitution may even occur. Growth potential is considered to be greatest
in the super-alloys, chemicals and carbides and lowest in magnets and tool
steels. Cobalt consumption projections to 1995 have been prepared for a high
case and low case based on similar economic assumptions as for copper. Based
on annual economic growth rates of 3.0% and 4.6% for industrialized countries
and LDCs, respectively, in the low case and and 3.5% and 5.4% per year,
respectively, in the high case. Long-run cobalt demand is expected to
increase at an annual average growth rate of 2.2% in the 'ow case and 3.0%
in the high case, as shown below:

19.        Bringing together the supply and demand projections, a situation of
cobalt over-supply is likely to last for most: of the decade. As noted in
para. 15, inventories have risen to over one year of consumption and even
with producer cut backs high inventories are to be expected for the next
several years. Presently available capacity plus new capacity under
construction will be adequate to meet expected demand requirements for all of
the 1980s. It will not be until the early 1990s that additional capacity may
be needed as shown below:

G. Cobalt Price Structure
20.       Historically, the market for cobalt has been a producers' market
with a "world producer list price" fixed by SOZACOM (Societe Zairoise de
Commercialisation des Minerais), the Zairian metal marketing company. This
price, which is also the selling price used by Zambia, is listed in Belgian
francs/kg for cobalt metal and for various compounds. In addition to the
producer price, a free market price has also been quoted in metals market
publications. Trading in the free market, which is handled by only some
twenty merchants, has been limited to less than 10% of world production
consisting of primary metal from several of the smaller producers and
secondary metal. Until the late 1970s, free market prices closely followed
producer prices and the free market was relatively unimportant. However,
during the perceived supply shortages of 1978/79 and surpluses of 1980/81,
the free market price became dominant as consumers sought to cover perceived
shortages on the open market and as a growing number of smaller producers
made supply available through free market sales channels, such as Japanese
and European refineries. Today, many of the smaller producers tend to sell
at the free market price or at a discount to the producer price in order to
sell their production in times of oversupply.
H. Past Price Trends
21.       Notwithstanding the frequent imbalances in cobalt supply and
demand, cobalt prices were very stable for most of the 1960s and 1970s. The
producer price (in nominal terms) increased steadily from $1.52 per pound in
1960 to US$4.44 per pound in 1976. The stability was largely achieved by
Zaire adjusting inventories and production (as opposed to prices) to keep
supply and demand balanced in the market place. During this period cobalt
prices increased by 1.4% in real terms and the price of nickel (a major
co-product and potential substitute) increased by 1.8% with the result that
the ratio of cobalt to nickel prices held within a relatively narrow range of
1.6-2.1. (See table following para. 26 for details).
22.       However the historical price stability subsequently gave way to a
period of severe boom and bust associated with the apparent supply-demand
imbalances of 1978-79 and 1980-82 (paras. 14 and 15). In 1978, a major price
upheaval occurred in response to panic buying associated with consumer scares
of supply shortages and disruptions. The free market price took on a new
importance when it rose from about US$6.00 per lb to US$45.00 per lb from the
beginning to the end of 1978. The producer price followed a similar but less
extreme pattern over the same period rising from US$6.40 per lb in January
1978 to US$25.00 per lb in February 1979.

23.       Subsequently, however, prices collapsed in the face of excess
supply and large inventory overhangs.  Zambia and Zaire attempted to hold up
the producer price and adjusted it only slowly. However, the major
consequence of their action was to lose sales and market share to other
producers, rather than stem the price decline. By the end of 1981, world
inventories were estimated to be equivalent to one year's supply with two
thirds or more held by Zaire. In late 1982, Zaire abandoned the producer
price, and began selling below free market prices in order to regain market
share. Cobalt prices fell as low as US$4.00 per lb. Subsequently, prices
have moved back upwards to US$6.00 per lb as of May 1983.

24.       At present prices, much secondary recovery has ceased.  However
primary cobalt production is still viable for most producers on a cash
basis. Mining costs for cobalt production are difficult to estimate because
cobalt, as a by-product of other metals, is not assigned a specific mining
cost. Processing costs can be more readily identified, but even these can be
complicated by the allocation of costs to different metals produced. To the
extent that estimates can be made, total refined metal production costs for
existing producers are considered to be in the range of US$4.00-6.00 per lb
for Zambia and Zaire and US$5.00-10.00 per lb (both in 1982 terms) for other
producers, including all mining, processing, transportation, and delivery
costs to European or US warehouses. However, cash production costs are
estimated to be in the range of US$2.00-6.00 per lb.

I. Future Price Projections
25.       For the future, cobalt prices are expected to be generally
depressed by the large inventory overhang and oversupply and to be relatively
insensitive, at least in the next several years, to future demand growth and
market conditions. Although some price movements may occur from year to year
depending on demand fluctuations, these are expected to be generally minor.
The main impact of demand upswings will be to enable producers with large
cobalt inventories such as Zaire to cut down their inventories. A strong
impact on prices is unlikely. Both producer and free market prices are
expected to remain in the US$5.00-7.00 per lb range (in 1982 terms) in the
future. At this level, prices will be nearly double expected nickel prices -
in line with the historical ratio. This price presupposes that Zaire will
adopt a relatively competitive marketing strategy in order to win back some
lost market share for other producers in order to reduce its large
inventories. Under such conditions Zambia would be expected to increase its
market share from about 10% previously to about 15% in future, gaining some
customers from smaller producers but making little inroad on Zaire's market.
In addition, Zambia should be able to sell about 500 tpy to CPEs. Future
price projections, together with historical prices are shown in the table
overleaf.
26.       For the purpose of base case economic and financial calculations,
the low demand case (para. 19) has been selected as the most probable of the
two based on latest market trends. Based on the previous analysis, Zambia
sales and price realisations would be as follows on a Zambian fiscal year
basis with prices in real terms (April 1, 1982 - March 31, 1983 = 100):

ANNEX 4-3
ZAMBIA - EXPORT REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
THE LEAD AND ZINC MARKETS
A. The Lead Market
1.        World reserves1/ of contained lead are estimated at 103 million
tonnes, of which 57 million tonnes (55%) are found in the USA, Canada and
Australia. The supply of lead comes from two sources--primary (mine)
production (60-70%) and secondary (scrap) recovery (30-40%). Five
countries--the USA, Australia, Canada, Mexico and Peru supplied 62% of
world mine production of 2.5 million tonnes in 1981. Seventy percent of
lead mine output is from co-product or by-product production, mainly in
combination with zinc but also with silver. Primary lead production is
therefore affected to a degree by the market situation for these other
metals. During the 1960s, primary lead production increased by 3.8%
annually, but in the 1970s, it stagnated, when it actually declined in the
industrialized countries.
2.        The principal use of lead is for storage batteries which account
for nearly 50% of world lead consumption. Gasoline additives, cable
sheathing, chemicals and soldering are other important uses. Consumption
grew steadily in the 1960s, but growth rates fell off in the 1970s,
especially in industrialized countries, as a result of the slump in
automobile manufacturing and the shift to smaller cars with lighter
batteries following the oil crisis in 1973-74. However, growth of
consumption was also reduced by other factors, including a decline in the
use of lead as a gasoline additive and substitution by plastics in a
variety of uses, including building construction, electrical cable covering
and in cans and containers.
3.        The future demand for lead depends largely on the battery and
automobile sector as the use of lead as a gasoline additive is expected to
decline further and no growth is foreseen in other uses such as cable
covering or chemicals. Consumption of lead in the traditional battery
market is expected to increase steadily in the 1980s. Lead will also
likely be required for batteries for electric vehicles in the late 1980s.
The short-term prospects are for demand to increase by about 1.5% per annum
from 1980-85. The yearly growth of lead consumption in industrial
countries will be only about 1.0% per annum, but for the developing
countries the growth will be in the order of 3.0% per annum.  From 1985-95,
as the world economy improves, lead demand is expected to recover to a
long-run growth of about 2.0% per annum.
4.        Lead prices are expected to increase from US$0.25/lb in 1982 to
about US$0.35 per lb by 1985 and then decline to about US$0.30 per lb in
1987 (all prices in current terms). As mentioned for copper and cobalt, a
cyclical upswing and downturn in the economies of the industrialized
countries is implied in this forecast over the next five years.  In the
longer term, lead prices are expected to increase steadily in real terms to
US$0.40 per lb (in 1982 terms), in 1995 based on estimated production costs
for new projects.

B. The Zinc Market
5.        World reserves of zinc are estimated at 147 million tonnes
(contained metal), of which 61 million tonnes (41%) are located in
Australia, Canada and the USA. The remaining reserves are widely
distributed in many countries. In addition 121 million tonnes of resources
are known.
6.        Australia, Canada and the USA accounted for 43% of the world mine
production of zinc of 4.5 million tonnes in 1981; 63% of the production of
these three countries was exported, largely from Canada and Australia to
Western Europe. In addition to world primary production, there are small
amounts of zinc scrap recycled, mainly in the USA.
7.        World zinc production grew strongly in the 1960s, but stagnated
in the 1970s due to low demand. In the mid-1970s, additional new
production came on stream, including two large mines at Tara, Ireland, and
Rubilas, Spain, resulting in a worldwide capacity utilization of only
80-85% in the late 1970s. Despite the closure of several small mines and
older smelters, considerable surplus capacity presently exists, especially
smelting capacity in Europe and mine capacity in developing countries.
8.        The major uses of zinc are as a protective coating for steel and
in die-casting production for automobile components. Construction and
transportation are both cyclical industries, mlaking zinc consumption
volatile on a year-to-year basis. Other markets include the direct use of
zinc as an alloy in brass and bronze castings and the use of zinc oxides
for ceramics, paints, chemicals and rubber manufacture. But zinc is prone
to substitution because it is relatively heavy and has a low strength-to-
weight ratio. Zinc has lost market share in various uses to other
materials such as aluminum and plastics, especially in recent years.
9.        Zinc consumption grew strongly in the 1960s, but growth rates
declined in the 1970s, especially in the industrialized countries. For
example, the amount of zinc per automobile declined from 80 pounds in 1968
to 28 pounds in 1979. Future prospects for zinc consumption growth are
limited; they exist in the areas of coatings for steel corrosion protection
in builders' hardware and in foundry uses. However, these markets are
likely to provide only modest increases in zinc usage. World zinc demand
is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of about 2.0% per annum
between 1980 and 1985. If the expected recovery in the world economy is
realized, this growth rate could increase to around 2.0% per annum in
1985-95.
10.       Zinc prices are expected to rise from US$0.34/lb in 1982 to about
US$0.45/lb in 1985 and falling back to US$0.40/lb in 1987 (all prices in
current terms). Long-run trend prices are assumed to increase to US$0.50
per lb (in 1982 terms) in 1995 based on estimated production costs for new
projects.

15.        The index for international inflation is used to inflate the
foreign component of each element category. The local component of the
expatriate labor and the local labor are inflated with the index for
inflation in Zambian labor market. As fuel stores are assumed to increase
with international inflation, they are inf:Lated with the index for
international inflation. For the local coraponent of the maintenance and
other stores, the Zambian wholesale price Lndex is used. Electricity is
assumed to increase with international inflation. The local component of
other elements is inflated by the index of weighted average domestic
inflation. From the breakdown presented above, the foreign component
accounts for 46% of divisional costs. This; has been extrapolated to obtain
the foreign component of operating costs by process. The local component
of the operating costs by process, is inflated by the weighted average
index for domestic inflation.
J. Lead/Zinc and Other Metals Operating Costs
16.       The operating costs for lead/zinc (K 7.0 million) and other
metals (K 4.8 million) are projected on the basis of FY83 costs (K 67.0
million) provided by ZCCM. The selling and delivery costs are also
included in this cost. To estimate the foreign and local components of the
costs for these metals, a 46% foreign component is assumed (para. 13).
K. Working Capital Assumptions
17.       The working capital assumptions are the following:
ZCCM Working Capital
FY83
Number of Days                  K million
Operating Cash                     15 days of sales revenue           43.2
Process Stocks                     50 days of sales revenue          141.6
Finished Stocks a/                                                   135.2
Stores                             82 days of operating costs        200.4
Accounts Receivable                60 days of sales revenue           148.3
Accounts Payable                   85 days of operating cost         335.9
(creditors and provisions)
a/  Process stocks are equal to the actual level multiplied by the cost
of production or the net realizable value, whichever is less.
L. Taxation
18.       The Zambian Government levies two kinds of taxes, i.e., the
mineral tax and the income tax on ZCCM's profits. The mineral tax is
applied to the profits or assessable income of each metal at the following
rates:
Mineral Tax Rates
Copper                          51%
Cobalt, Lead & Zinc             20%
Anode Slimes                    10%



- 122 -                      ANNEX 7-1
Page 8 of 9
19.        The assessable income for mineral tax purposes is calculated by
deducting the cash operating costs, interest expenses, various allowances
and capital allowances (accelerated depreciation) from the revenues. The
tax rates mentioned in para. 17 are then applied to the assessable income
for each metal.  The assessable income for income tax is calculated by
subtracting the mineral tax from the assessable income for mineral tax and
adding the interest receivable. Income tax is 45% of the assessable
income.
20.        Under Zambian law, losses are carried forward indefinitely to
reduce the tax liability from future losses. This creates a value
outstanding for refund of previously paid taxes which is used to offset
cash payments due in subsequent periods.
21.        Import duty has average 18% CIF costs for fuel stores, i.e.,
including CIF cost duty, maintenance stores and other elements. In
addition, there is a 9% excise levy on fuel costs.
22.        Payroll taxes include a 5% levy (PAYE) on the total labor costs
and a 20% levy (Selective Employment Tax) on the expatriate labor costs.
23.       A special tax or a levy, equivalent to 1.5% of total equity, is
imposed by the Government for each year that ZCCM does not pay any income
or mineral taxes.
24.       An export tax, 4% of the mineral revenues, was made effective in
April 1983 and increases to 8% in August 1983. This tax is considered as a
part of the production costs.
M. Subsidy
25.        The projections include a non-taxable subsidy of K 5 million to
ZCCM for each financial year that Kabwe Division (lead/zinc) operates at a
loss.
M. Debt Service
26.        Financial charges and principal repayment include ZCCM's existing
loans, and other loans necessary to match cash deficits. ZCCM provided the
financial charges and the principal repayment for the existing loans which
include cobalt and TL3 loans. The other loans and the respective terms are
given below:
