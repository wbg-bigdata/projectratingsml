RURAL AFFORESTATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                                Government of Zimbabwe
Amount:                                  SDR 6.8 million (US$7.3 million
equivalent).
Terms:                                    Standard
Purpose:                                 The proposed project would constitute
a first phase in developing a rural
afforestation program, and would build
up the implementing agencies, collect
socioeconomic and technical informa-
tion, and test and develop appropriate
afforestation policies. In addition,
it would help to meet the demand for
fuelwood and poles by setting up tree
nurseries, plantations and demonstra-
tion and trial plots.
A risk exists in the nursery component
where participation by smallholders in
the tree planting program is uncer-
tain. This risk has been minimized by
keeping the size of this component
very modest, while insuring maximum
flexibility during implementation.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE
FOR A RURAL AFFORESTATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit of SDR 6.8 million (US$7.3 million equivalent) to the Government of
the Republic of Zimbabwe to help finance a Rural Afforestation Project.
The credit would be on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited
the country in September 1980, after which a Country Economic Memorandum
(Report Number 3234b-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in
April 1981. This description is based on that memorandum and on informa-
tion obtained on subsequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq km, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the north-
west, and South Africa on the south. The population, as of December 1981,
was estimated to be 7.7 million, 97 percent of whom are Africans.1 The
remain.Jcr consists of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000
people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is es-
timated to be about 3.4 percent per year. The number of Europeans has been
declining due to emigration, which has been occurring at an average rate of
about 1,700 persons per month. According to estimates based on pre-war
data, 20 percent of the population is urban but this almost certainly
understates the present extent of urbanization.
4.        In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
1 The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature for population divisions is
used throughout. The first census since 1969 took place in August
1982;the results are not yet available.



income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person. In spite of this good growth performance, distribution
of income and assets between Africans and non-Africans remains highly
skewed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969 updated legislation of the 1930s and
confirmed division of the country's total land area into roughly two equal
parts for European and African settlement, the Europeans possessing most of
the best land. Given the difference between the size of the two groups,
the division resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately
2.5 ha per African and 65.2 ha per non-African. The degree of disparity
will begin to change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar
disparities exist in the distribution of other productive assets and in-
come. Rough estimates made in 1979 of the differences in per capita income
suggest that the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110
(US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.        Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, the
international community imposed economic sanctions and, in 1973, a costly
war of independence started. The sanctions were only partly effective.
Between 1965 and 1974, real GDP grew at about 7.0 percent per year and per
capita income at about 3.5 percent. Exports expanded, enhancing the coun-
try's ability to import. Notably, the sanctions stimulated development of
local import substitution capacity, so that by 1979 consumer goods were
only about 10 percent of total imports, compared with 22 percent in 1964.
Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of commercial agriculture and
the rapid growth of investment in and exports from the mining sector.
6.        However, the economic situation changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The added effect of the guerrilla war, increases in the oil
price and two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per
capita income in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While
the value of exports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic
increase in the cost of imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of
imports to fall precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also
declined significantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufac-
turing and mining are all important, contributing 18 percent, 26 percent,
and 5 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1981, and together providing 52 per-
cent of total formal employment. Agriculture accounts for more than
290,000 jobs or 28 percent of the total; manufacturing for 173,000 jobs and
mining, 69,000. Most of the remaining formal employment is provided by
service sectors such as public administration, education and, in parti-
cular, domestic service. Mining and agriculture earn significant amounts
of foreign exchange and supply most inputs for manufacturing, which in turn
accounts for between 30 and 35 percent of Zimbabwe's merchandise exports,
mainly processed agricultural and mineral items.
8.        Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly as resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in



- 3 -
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased
by 47 percent in 1980 and by 26 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth has been extremely strong in agriculture,
which has benefited from good weather in 1980 and 1981. Consequently,
overall real growth of the economy was about 11 percent in 19U9, and over 8
percent in 1981.
9.        The substantial increase in imports in 1980-81 was financed with
reserve drawdowns and short-term borrowings. This increase in imports and
short-term borrowing, coupled with a slower than required rate of growth of
exports, have resulted in a very serious balance-of-payments situation.
10.       Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the coun-
try is to experience more equitably distributed growth. The major short-
run problem is controlling domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (cur-
rently about 17 percent per year). Some needed policies are already being
implemented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been
raised. The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 per-
cent in 1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a
percent of GDP has declined from its high of 14 percent in 1979/80.
However, further reductions must be accomplished during the current
(1982/83) budgetary exercise if stabilization efforts are to fully
succeed. Significant longer-term issues concern the need to increase the
level and quality of investment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a
wage policy consistent with the need to increase employment. Although
these issues are interrelated, the Government recognizes that increasing
employment and labor productivity are key to achieving its aim of growth
with equity.
11.       The Government is taking measures to address some of these prob-
lems. It has published a three-year Transitional National Development Plan
which sets a course for the economy for the next three years. The Govern-
ment is executing an IMF stabilization program, which the IMF Board
approved in March 1983 and stipulates a number of measures including: an
exchange rate adjustment (the Government devalued the Zimbabwean dollar by
20 percent in December 1982, in order to restore export competitiveness
that had been eroded by large increases in labor costs and high domestic
inflation); an adjustment in the basket of currencies on which the value of
the Zimbabwean dollar is determined; a reduction in the budgetary deficit;
limitations to wage and salary increases; and ceilings to short-term
external debt and domestic credit.
12.       Should the measures Government is taking effectively deal with
the above-mentioned problems, prospects for respectable growth and more
equitable distribution of income are quite good. Real increases in GDP
could well average 5.5 percent per year in 1980-85. Thereafter growth
could slow, perhaps, to an average of four percent per year, as investments
are made in longer-gestating programs with a more even distribution of
assets. Much of the burden of achieving these growth and equity goals must
fall on the agricultural sector. In the past, the commercial farms



- 4 -
accounted for the most agricultural production. However, the development
of smallholder agriculture has been assigned the highest priority.
13.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In December 1981, foreign debt
totaled Z$948 million (US$1,318 million equivalent) and the country's gross
international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated two
months of imports.  The external debt figure was equivalent to about 24 
percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which was about four
percent in 1980, is estimated to have risen to 8 and 15 percent in 1981 and
1982, respectively.  This rapid rise reflects the fact that nearly all
Zimbabwe's present debt must be repaid in the next six years which will
exert pressures on the short-term balance-of-payments situation. However,
so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts of short-term com-
mercial borrowing, the debt service ratio should begin to decline after
1984 even with large amounts of additional external borrowing. In light of
this and the country's potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe is
creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given the country's massive
external resource requirements for the next few years and the expected high
level of international interest rates and relatively hard repayment terms
of non-concessional borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to receive
part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Before 1965, the Bank made 5 loans totaling US$140.3 million
benefiting Rhodesia--two directly to the Government for agriculture (US$5.6
million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totaling US$87.7 million to
the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a US$9.0 million loan to
Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of the loans, the United Kingdom
serviced them after 1964. The loans for agriculture, railways and one for
power have been repaid. CAPCO is servicing its second power loan. During
FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50.0 million and a
credit of US$15.0 million for the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports
Program. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-ZIM) financed priority
import requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and components and
balancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing
sector. The Bank also approved a transport rehabilitation loan (1944-ZIM)
of US$42.0 million to finance import requirements of spare parts, track
maintenance equipment and tools for the railways, equipment for the Central
Mechanical Equipment Department and technical assistance. In FY83, a Simall
Farm Credit Project, approved by the Association for US$30.4 million
(1291-ZIM), will provide the Agricultural Finance Corporation with funds
for seasonal loans and for medium- and long-term loans for equipment and
farm improvements, as well as technical assistance. The Association also
approved a credit (1296-ZIM) for US$1.2 million to select the optimum
system of supplying petroleum.   A loan of US$105.0 million, approved by
the Board in December 1982 (2212-ZIM), will enhance power generating



capacity through a Phase II extension of Hwange Thermal Power Station. It
will also include construction of a transmission line, technical assistance
and training. In February 1983, the Board approved a US$70.6 million loan
for a Manufacturing Export Promotion Project that will make available
foreign exchange to finance priority import requirements of raw materials,
spare parts, components, balancing equipment and export promotional
services. A summary statement of Bank Group operations and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects are provided in Annex II. Project implemen-
tation thus far is satisfactory and disbursements have kept to schedule.
15.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Hwange Colliery Company Limited to help finance a
project to produce coal for a thermal power station presently under con-
struction and other uses. The investment was in the form of a US$38.0 mil-
lion loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20.0 million was for IFC's own account
and US$18.0 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan.
IFC was also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of commer-
cial bank financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of
the United States.
16.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects in agriculture and
rural forestry development, power, railways development, manpower devel-
opment and training and industrial intermediation. Meanwhile, a highway
project, which includes constructing about 315 km of rural roads in the
communal areas plus a pilot feeder road program, and a national
agricultural extension and research project are scheduled for Board
presentation in May 1983.
17.       The Bank has reviewed or is reviewing the energy, agricultural,
urban, education and manpower, population, health and nutrition, and tele-
communications sectors; reports either have been completed or are being
written.
18.       Since Bank lending to Zimbabwe is very recent, Bank Group expo-
sure is still very low. At the end of 1981, the Bank accounted for six
percent and IDA and the Bank combined, for about eight percent of
Zimbabwe's public external debt.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND FORESTRY SUBSECTOR
Agricultural Sector
19.       Zimbabwe has a land area of about 39 million ha.  The main topo-
graphic areas are: (a) the highveld, a plateau at about 1,300 m running
through the center of the country from southwest to northeast; (b) the
middleveld, at about 900 m, on either side of the highveld; (c) the low-
veld, at about 500 m, in the southeast and northwest corners of the coun-
try; and (d) a high altitude ridge along the eastern border with



- 6 -
Mozambique.  Summers are warm and wet, and winters cold and dry.  Annual
rainfall is between 300 mm and 1,000 mm. Barely one-third of the country
is suitable for rainfed crops, the drier areas being suited only to ranch-
ing.
20.       Agriculture and forestry contributed an estimated 18 percent of
GDP in 1981, and 47 percent of total merchandise exports. Agriculture,
therefore, is a major source of foreign exchange, and has potential to in-
crease export earnings in real terms. About 75 percent of the population
depend on agriculture for their income, and the sector provides about 28
percent of all formal employment opportunities.
21.       There are about 5,800 commercial farmers on 15 million ha under
freehold title, including a small number of large irrigated estates; about
8,500 farmers on 1.5 million ha in the African purchase areas under tenancy
or freehold titles; and about 700,000 farm families on 16 million ha in the
communal areas, with traditional land tenure rights administered under the
hereditary chiefs. The African purchase areas have not yet reached the
high levels of productivity achieved by the commercial sector, but are a
source of some expertise in commercial farming. About 60 percent of the
total population live in the communal areas, most of which have limited
agricultural potential. The land is subdivided into small semi-subsistence
units averaging about two hectares of crop. Many farmers combine food crop
production with small stock and cattle grazing on communal pasture lands.
Many male heads-of-households live and work away from home and women are
responsible for the bulk of the farm work. There are wide differences
among farmers, resulting from the availability of land, labor, farm manage-
ment capability and motivation.
22.       Zimbabwe is one of the few countries in Africa which consistently
produces food surpluses. The areas of highest productivity are commercial
farms, but a substantial area of underutilized and abandoned land exists in
this sector. Parts of this are being absorbed by a settlement programn
which is providing plots to the landless and those with insufficient land
in the communal areas. Farm sizes will range from 25-200 ha. Communal
cultivation will be encouraged, but will not be compulsory. However,
settlement, even on a massive scale, would barely keep up with population
growth, and must be combined with other measures to alleviate the problem
of over-cultivation in the communal areas.
Sector Issues and Government Strategy
23.       In high population density areas, widespread land degradation has
further reduced the already limited potential. Population pressure, 'Low
soil fertility and high risk of crop failure due to droughts has led to in-
creasing areas being brought under cultivation and a consequent reduction
in grazing lands. The increasing pressure on cultivable land together with
the increasing demand for wood also has put severe pressure on woodland re-
sources.



24.       Farming practices in the communal areas are generalLy satisfac-
tory, with almost universal ox cultivation and use of hybrid seeds.
Average yields are low, however, because of environmental and physical con-
straints, and lack of infrastructure, services and technologies. The
communal areas have not been well serviced with roads, marketing facili-
ties, input supply or agricultural extension based on adapti e research.
The suboptimal performance of communal area farmers is reflected in the low
level of income, which averages an estimated Z$180 per annum, including
subsistence, with an additional Z$90 from remittances from absentee male
family members.
25.       Communal area inhabitants face seemingly insuperable problems.
The Government is confronted with an array of difficult choices in order to
deal with the problems. Possible solutions within communal areas include
making available and improving services and providing technologies for more
intensive cultivation, including in some cases communal areas still not
over populated. The situation calls for better management of land and
other production assets, taking an integrated approach to land use involv-
ing cropping, tree growing and livestock raising. Such an approach is not
easy to foster given existing skills, organization, and incentives. How-
ever, a national extension and research program, recently negotiated for
possible IFAD and World Bank financing, would support this effort, as would
the proposed afforestation project. The Government is also studying irri-
gation options. Finally, and in addition to the settlement efforts noted
in para. 22, part of the solution would lie outside the agricultural sec-
tor. Already a sizeable proportion of residents derive income from non-
agricultural activities, and interdependencies between traditional agricul-
ture and the modern sectors provide the potential for gradually transform-
ing agriculture.
26.       In sum, the Government's strategy in agriculture aims at growth
with equity and the objectives include:  fair distribution of land owner-
ship; reduced poverty in rural areas; increased productivity and employ-
ment; maintenance of food self-sufficiency; an increased role for agricul-
ture as a foreign exchange earner and a supplier of inputs to industry;
integration of the commercial and small farm subsectors; land conservation;
and regional balance in development. A major element of the Government's
program is an ambitious program of resettlement of the landless, now in the
communal areas, in abandoned or underutilized commercial areas. The
*          Government hopes to achieve a twin objective of redlstribution of assets
without jeopardizing output from the commercial areas.
Forestry Subsector
27.       More than 17 million ha, or slightly less than half of the total
land area of Zimbabwe, is covered with forests.  An estimated 15 million ha
are open savanna woodlands traditionally exploited for fuelwood and pole
supply, and more than two million ha of indigenous forests are currently
managed as forest estates for high quality timber production.  In addition,
about 94,000 ha of industrial plantation, mainly of pine and eucalyptus,



- 8 -
have been established of which about 22,000 ha are state owned and the
remainder privately owned. The majority of these plantations are in
Manicaland and distant from heavily-populated communal areas and urban
fuelwood markets. Consequently, transporting wastewood from these areas
for use as fuelwood is not financially viable.
28.       About 6.5 million ha of the country's indigenous woodlands are
located in communal lands, of which 174,000 ha cover watershed areas and
are protected and controlled by the Forestry Commission. Except for some
woodland areas which have been reserved for controlled forestry production
most of the indigenous woodlands are in areas of low population density.
The remaining woodlands in the communal areas are used freely for fuelwood
and pole supply, as grazing land and as reserve land for agriculture. How-
ever, these open savanna woodlands also have a low timber density, are in
general of poor quality and slow to regenerate. In areas of high popula-
tion density, the woodland cover is seriously reduced, and the collection
of firewood is becoming more difficult and time consuming.
Forestry and the Economy
29.       Wood is the most important source of energy for domestic heating
and cooking for the rural and urban poor. About 6 million people, or over
75 percent of the total population, use wood for cooking and heating. The
total volume of fuelwood used in Zimbabwe is estimated to be over six
million cubic meters annually of which nearly five million cubic meters are
in the communal areas. In addition, the country is estima,ed to produce
about 700,000 cubic meters of poles, posts and other minor construction
wood. Assuming an urban retail price of Z$15 per cubic meter for fuelwood
and Z$35 per cubic meter for poles and other construction wood, the total
value of non-industrial wood would be about Z$90 million per annum. In
addition, a further Z$60 million of industrial wood is produced each year.
Institutions
30.       The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism has the overall
responsibility for forestry development. The two main instiLutions which
would be directly involved in the project are the Forestry Commission and
the Department of Agricultural Technical and Extension Services (AGRITEX).
The Forestry Commission was established in 1954, under the Forest Act
(Chapter 125) as the successor to the Department of Forestry in the
Ministry of Agriculture.  The Commission is a semi-autonomous body unde.-
the Ministry of Natural ?Regources and Tourism and is responsible for the
administration of state forests, the conservation of timber resources and
the regulation and control of forests and its produce.
31.       The main activities of the Forestry Commission, h-i-.herto, have
centered on establishing and maintaining commercial plantations mainly in
the eastern districts. In addition, the Forestry Commission manages
800,000 ha of indigenous woodlands in northwestern Matabele½and and the
Midlands. The felling, extraction and processing of timber from these



-9-
woodlands is mainly carried out by private enterprise under Forestry Com-
mission supervision. Since independence, the Government has placed high
priority on development of communal areas, including rural afforestation.
As a result, the Commission now will cover a much wider field than before,
and has been reorganized so as to be able to cope with its expanded role.
32.       AGRITEX was established in December 1981, by the amalgamation of
two departments under different ministries which provided separate exten-
sion services to commercial farmers and communal area farmers. AGRITEX's
priority is service to communal area farmers. Its technical capacity is
good but requires further reorientation towards communal area farmers.  As
noted in paragraph 25, a proposed national agricultural extension and
research project is expected to strengthen AGRITEX's entire national exten-
sion program.
Constraints
Need for Adequate Commitment
33.       Although the problem of depleting sources of wood in communal
areas has been recognized since the 1930s, past administrations have not
accorded consistently high priority to communal area afforestation in terms
of resource allocation. Consequently, little development has taken place
in terms of actual afforestation, research and institutional development.
The effects of past neglect have resulted in lack of information, data and
experience necessary for evolving an effective rural afforestation program
and lack of capacity to implement a substantive program. The Government
has now accorded high priority to rural afforestation and the proposed pro-
ject is designed to reflect this.
Land Tenure
34.       As already indicated (para. 19) more than two-thirds of
Zimbabwe's land area is unsuited for rainfed agriculture. There is need
therefore to carefully develop and maintain appropriate land-use policies.
Notwithstanding the apparent aggregate availability of land unsuitable for
cropping, afforestation programs do face the issue of land availability in
the high-density (but often wood deficit) communal areas, most of which are
over populated.  In addition to the actual availability of land, the com-
plex communal land tenure poses questions regarding security of tenure,
limitations to individual initiatives and protection to seedlings and young
tree plants; communal grazing rights may impede ready responses to the wood
crisis. The Government is actively considering both the land use and land
tenure problems. The Tribal Trust Land Act (TTL Act) recently has been
replaced by a Communal Land Act. However, in view of the complexity of the
issues involved, resolution of the matter is likely to be protracted.
Meanwhile, the Government intends to make land available on a case-by-case
basis for specific afforestation investments.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The genesis of the proposed project is a study of rural affores-
tation carried out by the Whitsun Foundation, a non-profit development
agency in Zimbabwe. This study was used for a project proposal prepared by
the Forestry Commission. The Staff Appraisal Report of the Rural Afforest-
ation Project (No. 4140-ZIM dated April 18, 1983) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washing-
ton from April 11-14, 1983 with the Zimbabwean delegation led by Mr. Isaac
Takawira, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and
Development. A Credit and Project Summary is given at the beginning of
this report. Annex III contains supplementary project data.
Project Rationale
36.       Estimates of existing supplies and of present rates of consump-
tion of wood indicate that there are many wood deficit districts. At the
present per capita consumption rates, the demand for fuelwood and poles is
expected to double by the year 2000 because of increasing population. At
the same time, the area of indigenous woodlands (and hence, wood supply) is
expected to be declining owing to indiscriminate felling and larger areas
being brought under cultivation. At present, there is little hope that al-
ternative sources of energy will be available at prices which the popuLa-
tion in general can afford. Rural electrification is unlikely, in the
foreseeable future, because of high costs and low densities of consumers.
Imported liquid fuels are prohibitive and are a drain on foreign exchange.
Coal, which is available domestically in plentiful supply, is unlikely to
meet much of the energy needs in the rural areas because of high transport
and distribution costs. Consequently, for the rural areas there are few
efficient, immediate alternatives to fuelwood.
37.       The project would enhance the limited knowledge available about
the attitudes of communal area residents towards rural afforestation, sug-
gest means of generating interest in tree planting and conservation, and
strengthen the capabilities of implementing agencies. This project has
been designed as a modest first stage, and is characterized by selectivity
in choice of target areas and populations within a relatively small scale
of operations; with flexibility to experiment, learn and change course.
The project would be restricted to the highest wood deficit areas and also
cover the main ecological zones of Zimbabwe. To insure practical value for
a future major afforestation program, populations with a variety of socio-
economic characteristics would be included. A feature of the project would
be the development and provision of forestry extension services as part of
an integrated approach incorporating crops, livestock and conservation.
This requires the participation of AGRITEX, with technical support from the
Forestry Commission.

Project Description
38.       During a four-year period the project would:
(a) Develop institutional capability by providing for:
(i) staff training;
(ii) establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit;
(iii) infrastructure, vehicles and equipment.
(b) Carry out the following surveys, studies, review
and research:
(i)  an attitude and practice survey of farmers in
the wood deficit areas;
(ii)  a forest resource survey;
(iii) a review of forestry policy in communal
areas;
(iv)  a wood energy utilization study;
(v)  preparation of an afforestation program; and
(vi)  strengthening the silvicultural research pro-
gram and expanding seed orchards.
(c) Implement the following afforestation activities:
(i)  establishment of up to 48 nurseries to pro-
vide seedlings;
(ii)  set up a support fund to assist individuals
or groups wishing to establish nurseries or
woodlots;
(iii) establishment of demonstration and trial
plots;
(iv)  establishment of up to 9 blocks of tree plan-
tations close to major concentrations of pop-
ulation; and
(v)  publicity and tree planting campaigns.
Detailed Features
Institution Building
39.       Training would aim to develop the institutional capacity to reach
farmers involved in rural afforestation. The training program would in-
clude formal training of staff (for which a program has already been
instituted), improvements in course contents, provision of course materials
(which in part will be provided for by the recently negotiated National
Extension and Research Project), local seminars and study tours (which are
being developed) by key Forestry Commission and AGRITEX staff to comparable
forestry projects in other countries. Nurserymen and persons starting



- 12 -
nursery projects would also receive initial training under the project.
The project would set up a monitoring and evaluation unit by September 30,
1983, which will assess and report progress, carry out periodic reviews,
prepare a project completion report and assist in preparation of the next
rural afforestation project. The qualifications experience and terms and
conditions of service of the head of the monitoring and evaluation unit and
consultants to be employed will be agreed with IDA (draft Development
Credit Agreement, Section 3.01(c)). Finally, office space and equipment,
vehicles, field staff housing and incremental staffing would be provided to
the Forestry Commission.
Studies and Research
40.       A baseline survey will be conducted on selected project areas in
early 1983, aimed at assessing demand and supply for wood tree planting
patterns, attitudes and constraints to tree planting. Consultants to carry
out the survey would be employed on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA,
and the results of the survey would be communicated to IDA not later than
October 31, 1983 (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.03). In
addition, the following will be carried out: a survey of indigenous forest
resources; a forestry policy review which will focus on legislation con-
cerning utilization of national forests, environmental protection and pric-
ing; a review of ongoing wood energy studies, whose report will be submit-
ted to IDA by September 30, 1983 (draft Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.03), directed towards efficient utilization and conservation of
wood energy; and preparation of the next phase of rural afforestation. In
regard to forestrv nolicv, it present wcod 4s ccnsidered to b         froe z_--
modity in the communal areas, and no stumpage fee is levied on trees cut in
indigenous woodland. The forestry policy review would consider and recom-
mend legislation and other possible measures to better assure eventual
utilization of natural forests on a sustained yield basis; to reinforce
environmental protection; and to develop pricing of wood and other products
from Forestry Commission plantations based on cost recovery. Research will
cover trials for various tree species, expansion of seed orchards, trials
on repellants to protect young trees, different land clearing methods and
investigations on disease affecting Mukwa trees.
Afforestation
41.       The afforestation program would include the establishment of up
to 48 nurseries by the Forestry Commission in 16 districts to ensure avail-
ability of seedlings for sale, and to serve as a focal point to generate
interest amongst the communal area inhabitants.  The project would provide
assistance-in-kind from a support fund to groups wishing to establish wood-
lots and to individuals or groups wishing to establish nurseries in areas
not covered by Forestry Commission nurseries. Adjacent to a1l nurseries
the Forestry Commission would establish plots to demonstrate proper plant-
ing, maintenance and harvesting techniques for eucalyptus and other
species. Trials would also be carried out with new tree species. The
Forestry Commission would also establish nine block plantations, four in or
near communal areas and five near major urban areas, totalling 1,400 ha.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government will
finalize arrangements for making land available for urban plantations by
December 31, 1983 (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.04(a) and
(b)).

Project Cost and Financing
42.        The total project cost net of taxes and duties is estimated at
Z$9.7 million (US$10.6 million), of which US$2.3 million (22 percent) re-
presents the foreign exchange costs. The proposed IDA credit of US$7.3
million, which would finance 75 percent of the total project cost, would
cover the total foreign exchange costs of US$2.3 million and local costs
amounting to US$5.0 million. The project provides Z$0.2 million (US$0.2
million) for three and one-half years of internationally recruited staff at
a cost of Z$52,440 (US$57,000) per staff year and Z$0.2 million (US$0.2
million) for 23 staff months of short-term consultancies at an average cost
of Z$9,752 (US$10,600) per staff month (including salaries/fees,
subsistence, and travel).
Procurement
43.        Contracts for the procurement of vehicles financed under the
project (US$0.4 million) would be aggregated where possible into orders of
US$100,000 and above and would be procured through ICB in accordance with
the Bank guidelines from suppliers who maintain or agree to maintain in
Zimbabwe an adequate after-sales service and an inventory of spare parts.
Orders for vehicles less than US$100,000 and those for furniture and
equipment (US$0.4 million) would be procured through local competitive
bidding, in accordance with Forestry Commission procurement practices which
are considered satisfactory. The procedures include use of an established
tendering committee, of well-defined advertisement and minimum bidding
requirement and of clear rules regarding acceptance of lowest qualified
bids. Because of their dispersed location and individual small size,
contracts for offices, houses and other minor items of civil works (US$2.1
million) would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally in which international firms represented in Zimbabwe could also
participate. Services of expatriate staff and consultants (US$0.7 million)
would be obtained in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.02).
Disbursements
44.        Disbursements under the IDA credit would be on the following
basis:
(a) 80 percent of the cost of civil works (US$1.6 mil-
lion);
(b) 100 percent of the cost of vehicles and equipment
(US$0.8 million);
(c) 100 percent of expatriate staff salaries, consul-
tant fees and cost of studies (US$0.9 million):
(d) 100 percent of training costs (US$0.2 million);
(e) 65 percent of local salaries and allowances
(US$2.6 million);



- 14 -
(f) 70 percent of the cost of equipment and vehicle
operation and maintenance (US$0.7 million); and
(g) an unallocated amount of US$0.5 million, repre-
senting a portion of the contingencies of the
above categories and transferable to them as re-
quired.
Project Implementation
45.       The Forestry Commission will be the implementing agency, and for
that purpose, it has established a Rural Afforestation Division. In addi-
tion, a number of other units of the Forestry Commission (Research and Fin-
ance Divisions, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, and Training and Publicity
Division) would also participate in implementing the project.
46.       The Forestry Commission would be assisted by AGRITEX, which would
be responsible for forestry extension under the project, utilizing its cur-
rent organization and staff for field services in the project area. The
Forestry Commission and AGRITEX would establish a Project Joint Working
Party at headquarters and a field coordination group in each district to
insure proper coordination between the two agencies.
47.       The Government established in June 1982 a Project Coordinating
Committee (PCC) on which eight ministries and the Forestry Commission are
represented. The purpose of PCC is to ensure cooperation and coordination
at the national level, proper planning, implementation and monitoring of
the project. The PCC is expected to play an important role in generating
and maintaining support for the project, overseeing promotional and educa-
tional efforts, and facilitating availability of land and related
infrastructure.
Accounts, Audit and Reporting
48.       A system of cost accounting would be set up and separate accounts
relating to the project would be maintained, and would be audited by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Association. The audited accounts would
be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of the finan-
cial year (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.01(c)). Six
monthly progress reports, project review reports and a project completion
report to be prepared no later than six months of the project closing date
would be submitted to the Association (draft Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.06(d)).
Justification, Benefits and Risks
Benefits
49.       This project would help ease the growing rural energy shortage in
Zimbabwe by establishing a foundation for a comprehensive rural afforesta-
tion program.



- 15 -
50.         The quantifiable benefits are production of fuelwood and build-
ing poles for rural and urban households. The average annual wood produc-
tion over year 6 through year 19 of the project is estimated at 15,000
cubic meters f'rom Forestry Commission plantations and 23,200 cubic meters
from on-farm woodlots, assuming a positive response to the sale of seed-
lings. In all, the project plantings could provide the full ood require-
ments for about 3,820 families.
51.        Over the four-year implementation period, the project is expected
to generate 340 permanent positions of full-time employment, the majority
being drawn from the local populations. In addition, the project will pro-
*         vide a sizeable amount of seasonal and casual employment.  Moreover, the
project would have a number of non-quantifiable benefits, including insti-
tution building, soil conservation, a slowing down of the destruction of
natural forests, and most important, the project would form a sound basis
for developing a comprehensive rural afforestation program.
52.        Rate of Return.  Although the project is experimental in nature
and some of its benefits cannot be quantified, an economic analysis was
carried out on the directly productive components of the project (including
63 percent of project costs). Based on an estimated economic value of
fuelwood corresponding to the cost of the cheapest alternative source of
energy in rural areas, coal, an indicative economic rate of return for the
project was calculated at approximately 14 percent.  Although coal is used
in the estimates, it is not consumed in significant amounts in rural
areas. Given that its introduction would involve substantial changes of
habit, large investments in storage facilities, plus the high distribution
and handling costs, it is not considered a likely alternative. A 50
percent reduction in farmer uptake, the major uncertainty, would reduce the
economic rate of return to 11 percent, as project costs would also be
correspondingly reduced.
Risks
53.       The project is the Forestry Commission's first major undertaking
in the communal areas and would be confronted by a number of uncertainties,
particularly, socioeconomic factors which would influence farmer acceptance
of the project activities. The principal project risk relates to the nur-
sery component where obtaining adequate participation by smallholders in
the tree planting program would remain a challenge.  The risk has been min-
imized by building in a strong monitoring, evaluation and study effort and
by allowing considerable flexibility in implementation. Studies carried
out during the project would provide information on a variety of factors
influencing farmer receptiveness to the project including land tenure and
land-use patterns. In addition, provision has been made for inducement in
the form of a support fund which would provide assistance-in-kind to groups
who wish to establish woodlots and nurseries.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Zimbabwe and the Association, and the recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
55.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION

C. STATUS OF BANK AND IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Loan No. 1959-ZIM    Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$50
Credit No. 1120-ZIM  million and US$15 million, respectively, of April 9,
1981; Effectiveness Date: April 9, 1981; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982
The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program was
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. It is too early to assess the full impact of the
loan and credit, nevertheless, during the loan and credit period,
manufactured output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange, ruii reconsEruction of
the sector is unlikely to be achieved.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 mil-
lion, of June 22, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equipment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipment Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 million has been reallocated to that
category.  Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
being processed.
Credit No. 1291-ZIM Small Farm redit Project: US$30.4 Million, of November
17, 1982; Effectiveness Date: February 10, 1983;
Closing Date June 30, 1986
The project is providing through AFC seasonal credit for seeds,
fertilizer and chemicals, medium-term credit for farm improvement and
equipment; plus facilities and technical assistance to AFC in support of
its expansion of small farm credit.

US$1.2 Million, of November 17, 1982; Effectiveness
Date: April 14, 1983; Closing Date:  June 30, 1984
The project provides for economic and engineering studies of
petroleum fuels supply options available to Zimbabwe, recommending the
preferred system, taking into account cost, suitability and reliability of
supply. The study also would recommend improvements in the procurement,
pricing and internal distribution of petroleum fuels, plus financing
training.
Loan No. 2212-ZIM    Power Project: US$105 Million of February 9, 1983;
Effectiveness Date: Not Yet Effective; Closing Date:

D. STATUS OF IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Wankie Colliery Company Limited (HCCL)             552-ZIM
IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of HCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In view of the diffi-
culty a rights offering would face in the current stock market environment
in Zimbabwe, the Government has agreed to make an equity investment in the
Company to replace the rights issue. Under the terms negotiated, the Gov-
ernment will subscribe to 40 percent of the Company's equity and will nomi-
nate five out of the ten directors, including the chairman.
