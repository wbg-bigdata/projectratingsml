(ICICI)
SUMMARY
i.        ICICI, closely associated with the World Bank from its start
in 1955, now seeks its eighth loan from the Bank, in an amount of $40
million. This report brings up to date the situation and prospects of
ICICI described in detail in Report DB-37a which was presented to the
Executive Directors (R67-138) on August 30, 1967.
ii.       ICICI has been the only privately owned term financing institution
which operated on a national scale in financing private industry in India.
In mid-1969, 14 important banks were nationalized, some of them shareholders
in ICICI. As a result, public sector institutions hold a slight majority
of ICICI's share capital. ICICI has built up a competent professional
staff, guided by experienced management and has a Board which includes dis-
tinguished men from industry and finance. Project appraisals and follow-
up work are generally good but staff work in judging the competitiveness
of its clients at home and abroad still needs to be improved.
iii.      The recession which characterized much of the past three years
of India's economy has affected ICICI's business. During the past year,
economic recovery has been making itself felt. As a result of the general
trends and ICICI's own efforts to mobilize new business -- especially
from large established companies -- ICICI's operations reached in 1969 a
level of nearly $44 million, a volume already attained in the mid-sixties.
More proposals, both for rupee and especially for foreign exchange assistance,
are coming to ICI0I.  ICICI has continued to direct its assistance to the
more modern sectors of Indian industry. Clients account for important shares
of India's manufacturing capacities and they have also made significant
contributions to Indian industrial exports, a feature that has become in-
creasingly important over the past two years. Also, there are clients who
have suffered from the recession.
iv.       ICICI's financial position is satisfactory although its portfolio
contains some weaknesses arising from the recession. The spread between
the cost of borrowed and lent resources has been decreasing in recent years
and the trend is continuing. ICICI will have to safeguard against a pos-
sible further decline in its spread due to the expected increase in the cost
of both rupee and foreign exchange resonrces needed in the future. ICICI
has indicated to the Bank that it will do what is necessary to protect its
profitability and that it proposes to adjust its rate on foreign currency
loans in light of its mid-1970 financial results.
v.        With the recent upswing in the Indian economy, ICICI may look
toward growing business over the next five years. This is likely despite
recent modifications in industrial licensing policies which generally aim



ii
at curbing investments by large firms, some of them important clients of
ICICI. Large firms are permitted, however, to invest more in broadly definred
priority sectors.  ICICI is aware that it will have to do more to assist
smaller industrial enterprises, though without sacrificing standards.
ICICI needs fresh resources both in rupees and in foreign exchange to con-
tinue its business.  For the former, ICICI has proposed a sizeable rupee
borrowing program and share capital increase by one-third, the latter to
take place in 1971. In foreign exchange, ICICI has a resource gap of
about $46 million to carry estimated commitments through the summer of 1972.
After allowing for likely contributions of about 5-6 million from bilateral
sources, ICICI is looking to the Bank for the rest.
vi.       On the basis of its record and business prospects, ICICI con-
tinues to be a suitable and a creditworthy borrower. Accordingly, a loan
of up to $40 million should be appropriate at this time to cover ICICI's
needs for about two years, namely through the summer of 1972.
vii.      The terms of the proposed loan should generally follow those of
recent Bank loans to development finance companies except that the free
limit should be related to ICICI's total contribution to an investment
project which it proposes to finance. Accordingly, only those of ICICI's
investment projects should require the approval of the Bank which need
more than the equivalent of $4 million of ICICIts resources including
Bank loan funds, irrespective of the amount of the latter.



APPRAISAL OF THE INDUST.MIAL CREDIT AND
INVESTMNT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
(ICICI) has been associated with the World Bank Group since its creation in
1955. Following seven Bank loans totalling $165 million, ICICI is now
seeking its eighth to cover the bulk of its foreign exchange needs over the
next 1-2 years. ICICI is approaching the Bank at a time when the Indian
economy and industry are recovering from a widespread recession.
2.        Industrici Trends. Tne industrial recession followed on tio unprecedent
droughts in 1965 and 1966, a drcp in perscnal inccmes, and a major cur&t.ilment oi
Government iniTestment expenditures for over ti:o yars. The recession was not
uniform, however, in its effects. Those manufacturers and their suppliers
who sold equipment to Central and State Government agencies were especially
hard hit. Thus, makers of machinery, electrical and engineering equipment--
many of them situated around Calcutta--suffered greatly. On the other hand,
production of fertilizer and agricultural implements fared better,
largely because governmental expenditures supporting agricultural investment
had been maintained.
3.        Advances in recent industrial investment appear insignificant,
but industrial output has noticeably improved since the second half of
1968; while no growth occurred over 1966/67 and 1967/68, the index rose by
6.6% in 1968/69 and, on recent estimates, by 7.5% until the end of 1969.
Resumed growath was brought about by a combination of factors. First of
all, there were three good successive harvests which increased spending
power and demand for consumer goods among the farmers, India's largest popu-
lation segment. There was some pick-up in public sector investment, espe-
cially on electrical equipment. And a number of Indian enterprises, espe-
cially makers of engineering goods showed surprising strength in the export
market. The 1968/69 exports of engineering goods more than doubled over
the previous year to a value of about $113 million. Towards the end of
1969, however, there were some setbacks in industrial exports due to short-
ages of certain raw materials (e.g. steel) and greater claims of the home
market. (Annex 1 gives a statistical synopsis reflecting recent industrial
trends.)
4.        Policy Setting.  During the recession, there were a number of
governmental attempts to stimulate investment activities through administra-
tive devices. These could hardly, however, make up for the flagging prime
stimulant, namely, public sector purchases. (Government spending had to
be curtailed due to inllctio-nary -;ressures 2nd becc'use buc>jet deficius hcd to be

control over industrial iLwestment imports, rhile feirly lenient on items r1ot
yet made in India, continued, as before, to eliminate systematically csld vithout;
much regard to cost and quality, imports of iteyas made in the count:y{.
5.        With the onset of economic recovery and changing political trenos
in India, policies have taken a turn. Most importantly, there was a par-
liamentary inquir.y, resulting in the "Report of the Industrial Licensing
Policy InquIry Cm-mittee"' of July 17, 1969 (the "Dutt Report") which con-
clucted essentially that industrial licensing criteria, contrary to recent
tendencies, should be stiffened in the direction of preventing economic
concentration (i.e. away from the "large business houses"). Also, it pro-
posed that the Gcvernment should be closely associated with "policy making
and direction of the financial institutions set up for helping industrial
development". Following examination of that report, the Government annource&'
important changes in its industrial licensing policy on February 18, 1970
(see Annex 2), with the following principal new features:
(a) The 20 large business houses and 53 large firms, named
in the Dutt Report, need special permission to enter into
new manufacturing activities, except for the broadly de-
fined "core" sector.  In fact, the large houses are en-
couraged to operate in the "core" and the "heavy invest-
ment" sectors.
(b) The new policy reimposes licensing for previously de-
licensed industrial activities, but industrial invest-
ments up Xo Rs. 10 mralion need no i.mdustrial livenre if ther 'z°
not call Ior substantial amounts of imported capitaf goods.
(c) Public financial institutions (and ICICI is considered
one of them) should take options to convert future loans
into equity; these institutions would have discretion
to negotiate conversion for past loans in cases of de-
fault. The institutions are also encouraged to nominate
representatives on boards of enterprises financed by them
(the so-called "joint sector"). The Finance Ministry's
Banking Department is to issue relevant instructions.
6.        Another important event is the Government's budget for 1970/71.
It provides for no additional corporate taxation, though it adds to per-
sonal and wealth taxation, and some new indirect levies on consumer goods.
The private sector's reaction to the budget bill has been bullish. Contri-
buting to this reaction is the provision for a 15% rise in public sector
investment outlays over 1969/70.
7.        Institutional Finance.  The activities of the three national
industrial financing institutions  IDBI, IFCI and ICICI, reflected in the
three years ending March 31, 165j/ thie general state of inductry2/.

Insurance Corporation (LIC) and the Unit Trust of indi.: 'UTiT. ;.



- 3 -
Compared with 1966/67, all of them experienced a drop in business in
1967/68. This was especially the case with IDBI because, aside frozm lagging
demand, it had less resources due to cuts in budgetary allocationsl . In
1968/69, all three institutions gained and the trend is continuing; ICICI
most of all, on account of the resuscitation of its foreign exchange appro-
vals and a pick-up in its equity operations. The nationalization in July
1969 of India's 14 leading commercial banks, which together with the State
Bank accounted for 83% of deposits at that time, has so far had very
little effect on the banks' resources or lending policies. Until the onset
of the current "busy session" in November 1969, commercial banks were flush,
partly because the Government deficits had percolated into the banking
system. With stepped-up recovery, recent credit demand has been rising
swTiftly. Because of a swift increase in the wholesale price index in
January and February 1970 ?/, the Reserve Bank of India considered it advis-
able to tighten credit in February 1970 and announced further restriction
at the end of April.
8.        India's capital market has recently been a fair barometer of in-
dustry. It was on the upswing late in 1968, when the index rose by 25%.
As Annex 4 shows, that year also saw an increase in the amount of
new issues (especially of debentures); nearly two thirds of these were under-
written by the national financing institutions. UTI is increasingly moving
into the foreground as an agent on the capital market largely at the expense
of IDBI. In mid-1969, the stock market broke by 16% on the announcement of
a ban on forward trading and bank nationalization. The market recovered
slowly thereafter through "Budget Day" on February 28, 1970, and optimism
has generally been prevailing since then.
II. THE CORPORATION3/
Ownership
9.        ICICI is now 15 years old.  As Annex 5 shows, foreign share-
holdings account (as before) for approximately 30% of total capital, the
remaining 70% being Indian-owned, much of it by Indian commercial banks.
Following the nationalization in July 1969 of the 14 major commercial banks
in India, public sector shareholders now control 51.6% of ICICI's capital.
None of the nationalized banks, but the Government-owned Life Insurance
Corporation of India (LIC) which holds about 19% of ICICI's shares, is repre-
sented on ICICI's Board.
1/  In 1968/69, this allocation was Rs. 250 million and in 1969/70 only
Rs. 120 million. Starting with 1970/71 and for the remainder of the
Fourth Plan, even lesser budgetary allocations are intended to IDBI
and other financing institutions.
2/  7.4% in the period February 1, 1969 to February 1, 1970.
3/ Previous reports with details on ICICI were presented to the Executive
Directors under R65-75 dated May 19, 1965 and R67-138 dated August 3(,
1967.



- 4-
Organization and Procedutres
10.       The Board.  ICICI's Board comprises 14 directors, as listed in
Annex 6. Two of them have been members since inception, and two (including
the LIC director) were appointed only in December 1969. The Board's basic
characteristic, namely of a group of people close to and experienced in
industry, has remained unchanged since the company was established.
11.       N.-$naeement and Staff.  Mr. G.L. Mehta, Chairman of the Board since
1958, continues in office.  Mr. H.T. Parekh, with ICI00  since 1955, was
promoted to the position of Deputy Chairman and Managing Director as of
January 1, 1969, and was succeeded by Mr. S.S. Mehta as General Manager.
Dr. P.B. Medhora is now Deputy General Manager. ICICI's staff, organized
as shown in Annex 7, now numbers 204 (as against 156 two years ago), inclu&'-
ing °9 professionals.
12.       Branch offices were opened for the first time in 1969, one in
Calcutta and another in Yadras, headed respectively by the former chiefs of
ICICI's Project Department and Follow-up Department.  These offices should
help ICICI find new business and to appraise small projects; so far, they
have served mainly to relieve the Bombay headquarters in follow-up functioxs.
With two senior officers away from Bombay, the loss of two other competent
staff members and the need to train new staff (four engineers and six
economists), there were for a time in 1969 more claims on ICICI's top office:&
to perform middle management functions. The tc') officers zLre noi.: less presse,.
ICICI's new staff is principally put on appraisal and follow-up work and
will need some time before they can contribute effectively.  But it is good
policy for ICICI to emphasize training with the increasing complexity of
industrial problems in India. As in previous years, ICICI supplements its
own training by exposing its officers to other institutions, such as the
lUorld Bank, and in turn makes its training facilities available to other
development finance companies- .
13.       Ar -aisal.  ICICI's appraisal staff is guided by experienced offi-
cers who have come up through the raeks.  There has been a further strength-
ening of the engineering and of the market research group. The appraisal
staff shows good understanding of technical and financial aspects of invest-
ment projects, and taken as a whole its appraisal work is adequate. The
Economics and Market Department not only looks at the market prospects of
individual projects appraised by ICICI, but has started preparing broader
studies of those industrial sectors (e.g. jute) where important applications
for ICICI financing are on hand or expected; these studies rest largely on
information available from ICICI's follow-up work. But there are still
weaknesses stemming from working traditions formed when the economy was
buoyant, and from lack of exposure to industrial developments abroad; judge-
ments have to be more trenchant on the abilities of client companies to
adapt to changing condition. Also, ICICI should place more emphasis on usIag
its leverage to promote the use of modern management techniques among its
customers. Wohile ICICI has started reviewing the export competitiveness
1/ Furthermore, ICICI is trying to help upgrade management expertise in
India and is now co-sponsoring a new training institute in Maddras.



- 5 -
of its clients, the focus of its marketing work is primarily on prospective
Indian sales; ICICI needs to collect and analyze more data for judging
clients' export prospects, an area which looms increasingly important. Even
for the Indian market, ICICI's (and its clients') market studies are made
difficult by such -imponderables us erratic rer- material supplies,
or by unexpected shortfalls in the public sector investment program. Dis-
cussions were held during loan negotiations on methodologies to improve ICICI's
assessments of its client companies competitive strength; further
discussions are planned for the future.
14.       Follow-up.  In the past year, there has been a perceptible
improvement in ICICI'ss follow-up activities.  Processang of information
received quarterly frqn ICICI's borrowers is now better done. Also, the
feedback of data to IOICI's management is playing an increasing role. But
the management still oelies considerably on its good contacts with business
and financial circles to keep abreast of developments in ICICI's portfolio.
So far, the information ICICI has gathered on borrowers has seldom led to
actions beyond occas;onal postponement of maturities or granting of addi-
tional financing. IVICI has intervened oriy in few cases to bring about
changes in management or to initiate other remedial actions among its
clients.
15.       Relations with Government and Buisiness. In part due to long-
standing connection, ICICI's Chairman and Managing Director have been
effective in resoling broad policy questions iwith the top decision makers
in the Government ,nd the public sector financing institutions. In con-
trast to earlier pars, contacts between ICICI and the authorities on day-
to-day matters coicerning specific ioans and investments, especially in
respect of licens's, have begun to become more active, due to initiatives
by ICICI staff. 'he Government continues as an important source of foreign
exchange businescto ICICI, despite ICICI's efforts to secure more on its
own. Recent pollical events in India continue to change the Delhi atmo-
sphere, so importnt to ICICI. "It is i.mpossibl, to foiecast ht- ne' policies,
pe rDicuLinly resuiltiig from tie new indusurial licensing rules, will affect
ICICI in The long run. /
16.       As inthe past, many ICICI officers have their professional origin
in the financia and business community around Bombay and Ahmedabad. ICICI
has particularr close relations in that region. Though ICICI enjoys good
relations withnany industrialists in other Indian business centers, the
near-identifiction of IICI with WlTestern India has been the subject of con-
siderable crilcism. The latter has been a contributing factor to the opening cf
the offices j Calcutta and Madras. Only the future will tell whether these
branches wij spruce up ICICI's image as an all-Indian institution. ICICI is
quite aware that it ijill have to deal soon t.ith another growing ;-rea of
criticism, the allegation that it does not do enough for small-size enter-
prises; this criticism is voiced by both Government and enterprises. Due
to the fact that ICICI has a growing number of repeat clients, ICICI's
appraisal procedures are now quite well known and appreciated.  The rece:rtly
increascd staff should allow more service to clients.



- 6-
Busine"s Policies and Practices
17.    ICICI has no policy statement but broad policy guidelines set by
its Board. ICICI still aims at directing its assistance to the more modern
type of industries. It also preferred having clients among medium-sized
enterprises but, in recent years, ICICI has been seeking, and transacting,
business with big, well-established houses. In fact, some exceptionally
big ICICI operations exceeded ICICI's normal policy limit of Rs. 30
million ($4 million) in foreign currency loans to any group of associated
companies.
lc;.   There was a strong reason for ICICI to take this course.  Until
the recession of the Indian economy in 1966 anc 1967, ICICI had an assured
flow of business, mainly in foreign exchange. ICICI's foreign exchange
loans were appealing to Indian industrialists because, due to their origin
from IBRD and some from KfW, they were either untied or offered access to
attractive supply sources. Most applications for foreign exchange loans
were referred to ICICI by the Capital Goods Committee, and thus ICICI was
not very active in looking for business. But the recession reduced the
flow of investment applications and ICICI had to take steps to protect and
increase its lending volume. ICICI's success in locating business from
big companies has helped to stem the decline in the growth of earning aseeP'
and to counteract the deterioration in the existing portfolio which the
recent recession had brought about.
19.    Another measure to expand ICICI's activities was a decision by
the Board to finance partnerships and private concerns; previously only
(public and private) limited companies were accepted as clients. While of
some interest in putting ICICI within reach of a smaller size of enter-
prise, the new policy has had a negligible impact on the volume of ICICI's
business. The same goes for ICICI's decision to support a hire-purchase
financing firm in which ICICI has taken a substantial minority position.
In an effort to do more financing of small business, ICICI is seeking ways
of working together with the State Financial Corporations. It is still too
ear'y to judge ICICI's efforts to attract small business.
20.    With better economic conditions, proposals are coming again on
their own, and through Capital Goods Committee referrals, to ICII.
21.    Loan Terms.  ICICI charges interest of $% on local currency and
8.5% on foreign currency loans. The borrowers carry the exchange risk for
foreign currency loans. A commitment charge of 1% p.a. is levied on unwithl-
drawn amounts which starts accruing for foreign currency loans approximatci>
two-and-a-half months after approval by ICICI's Board. ICICI's interest
rate on foreign currency loans, and even on local currency loans may have
been low in relation to te economic cost of scarce resources in India, but
this cannot be accurately-established.- In any event, the high liquidity of -
the Indian banking system, prevailing until a felT months ago, would have
been a brake on any move to raise interest rato levels.  But the general
credit situation has become tight again.  A raise seems necessary before !',ng
to prevent a drop in ICICI's profitability, and during negotiations, the Banx
has recommended to ICICI to raise its rates, at least on foreign currency  o



- 7 -
at an early date. A higher rate would also help keep industrial projects
away from ICICI which need relatively cheap resources, or administrative
measures, to be commercially viable, even in the highly protected Indian
economy ;furthermore by maintaining itself as an institution with reasonably
attractive return prospects, ICICI will have greater appeal to investors and
lenders when it plans to raise fresh resources. ICICI has indicated to the
Bank that it would do the necessary to protect its interest rate spread and
its profitability, and that it proposes to adjust its rate on foreign currenc:'
loans in light of its mid-1970 financial results.
22.       Annex 8 shows that loan maturities are normally in the range of
7-15 years for rupee loans and 10-15 years for foreign exchange loans, ex-
cept for a few small loans made for seven years. Loans are usually secured
Dy first mortgages and bank guarantees, the latter being sought when, in
ICICI's judgment, there are special risks in an operation. Exercising a
right it normally seeks, ICICI has representatives on the boards of 21
companies, usually outsiders rather than ICICI staff members.
23.       Policies on Equity Investments.  ICICI investments in equity rest
on .judgments of the general merits of a project and are not made for quick
yields and marketability.  ICICI is prepared to take the risks of organizing
undenrwritings of share issues even for new industrialists who would other-
wise not have been able to go to the market. ICICI's total equity invest-
ments exceeded on December 31, 1969, its net worth by approximately 5%.
Mowever, over one-half of the equity portfolio consisted of redeemable
preference shares with fixed final maturities, so that the high exposure
in equity does not pose particular problems for ICICI's long-term liquidity.
Recognizing its risks, ICICI's policy is to keep the outstanding equity
portfolio well below the limit set by the total of ICICIts net worth plus
the subordinated first Government loan (see paragraph 24).
Resources
24.        As at January 1, 1970, ICICI had at its disposal the following
resources invested or available for investment (net of repayments):
Rupees         % of
million       Total
Equit 
Share capital                       75.0          4.5

Total                    136.7         8.2
Borrowings
Rupee loans                       540.7         32.6
Foreign exchange loans            978.2         59.2
(including IBRD)                 (803.6)      L48.6)

Total Resources                       L,654.9        100.0



- 8 -
Annexes 9, 10 and 11 give details of ICIC1's borrowings in local and foreign
currency. The only novel feature in ICICI's resources pattern, since the
last Bank loan, are two debenture issues, one of Rs. 60 million in 1967 and
another of Rs. 50 million in 1969. All rupee borrowings, including the
debenture issues, are subordinated to ICICI's foreign debt. In addition,
the first Government loan, amounting to Rs. 75 million, is also subordinated,
in the case of liquidation, to all other debts and to the paid-in share
capital.
III.  OPERATIONS
25.       ICICI's recent onerations have focused, as in the past, on lending
to industrial enterprises and on underwriting and equity purchases. Total
commitments in 1968 and 1969 Pmounter2 to Rs. 189.3 T-iJ11ior and 's. 329.2
million respectively.  Ls shown in ^nnex 12, foreign currency lonns have
been the-,most imnportant activity, refl.e-cting on the one hand T.fICYT's unique
position as a source of financing in the form of relatively untied foreign
exchange: and on the other hand ICICI's successful nromotional efforts wit,
lerge industrial houses.  ICICI's rupee business has been less buoyant..
Foreign Exchange Operations
26.      The decline of foreign exchange operation during 1966 and 1967 as
abown in Annex 12 reflects the recession in the Indian economy. In 1968, with
the start of recovery, approvals climbed to an all-time peak (Rs. 211.2
million) and the 1969 figure was Rs. 188.9 million. A few large loans to
big, well-established companies helped the 1968 upswing. In 1969, ICICI
had a more balanced distribution of approvals by size of loans, as shown
in the following table:
Net Approvals of Foreign Exchange Loans
Below             Rs.  7.5 million   Re. 15.0 million
Rs. 7.5 million   Rs. 14.9 million   (US$2 million
Year   Total   (US$1 million)    (US$1-1.9 mion)  and more)
1965   170.3         161.6                8.7
1966   105.2           85.9              19.3
1967    65.4           29.0                 _                36J4
1968   211.2           28.6              10.9               171.7
1969   188.9          81.5               52.1                55.3
ICICI's contractual foreign exchange commitments followed approximately the
same trend as approvals, dropping from Rs. 202.2 million in 1965 to Rs. 72.6
million in 1966. But commitments went back to Rs. 93.8 million ($12.5
million) in 1968 and to a peak of Rs. 255.7 million ($34.1 million) in 1969.
The last two years' growrth in approvals and commitments has not yet been
followed by a corresponding increase in disbursements. The gap between



- 9 -
approvals and disbursements was Rs. 434.5 million at the end of 1968 and
Rs. 517.3 million ($69 million) at the end of 1969. This gap reveals the
need in ICICI's project appraisal to take better account of the ability of
managements to see projects through, even in the face of practical
and institutional difficulties in India.
Rupee Operations
27.       Annex 12 also shows that ICICI was able to maintain its rupee
lending approvals fairly evenly at about Rs. 50 million per year during the
recession. Little business, and competition from commercial banks which
were liquid for most of 1969, led to a drop in loan approvals to Rs. 24.7
million in 1968, and a figure of Rs. 39.8 million in 1969.
28.       ICICI also guarantees occasionally foreign suppliers' credits on
behalf of its customers. Only three such guarantees were outstanding at
the end of i969, for Rs. 49.4 million.
29.       The decrease in direct local currency lending since 19661/ has
been partially offset by ICICI's increased underwriting, especially of
debenture issues, which accounted for about two thirds of the total.  ICICI:z
underwriting of debentures has  had mixed   success;    even in an improved
market, ICICI had to  keep   60% of its underwriting commitments in 1969.
ICICI's share among other institutions in undenrriting any type of public
issues remained relatively constant at about 14% over the last five years.
Impact of ICICI's Operations
30.       The most important industrial sectors, as shown in Annex 13, in
ICICI's portfolio were at December 31, 1969:
Chemicals and chemical products      18.3%
Ferrous metals products              15.8%
I4achinery manufacture               12.4%
Electrical equipment                  9.4%
This is about the same pattern as in earlier years. MAhile ICICI financing
increased somew-hat in North and Northeast India during 1967-1969, ICICI's
loans and investments remain heavily concentrated in TfTest India in Gujarat
and Naharashtra.  The big foreign exchange loans in 1968 and 19t9 did not
affect the traditional geographical distribution of ICICI's financing.

31.       Through December 31, 1969, ICICI approved assistance to 794 pro-
jects sponsored by 536 client enterprises; among them 214 set up by new
enterprises. At the end of 1969, 143 proiects approved were in the plan-
ning stage, and 137 were under construction, of which 33 had sterted
32.       The following table illustrates how the 98 projects completed in
1968 and 1969 fared as to construction periods and costs:

51                        47
l'he substantial portion of high overruns in time, reflects in pert the
long-lasting impact of the recession and also the fact that some of
these projects could have been planned more carefully by their sponsors.
33.       By the end of 1968, ICICI clients accounted for substantial parts
of important Indian manufacturing capacities, for instance, about one half
in paper, two fifths in steel tubes and one third in each of bearings and
cables. Unfortunately, ICICI is also substantially engaged in the sectors
that suffered from the recession (see paragraph 36). More recently, ICICI
has been supporting the current round of expansion of nearly all Indian
tire manufacturers, of large chemical enterprises, and in adding to Indian
ocean shipping capacity.
34.       Many ICICI projects have contributed to increasing exports of Indian
industry.  ICICI clients contributed one-third of India's 1968



- 11 -
exports ( valued at about $260 million) o: commodities they nro-
duced. Among the larger ex)porters financed by ICICI are makers of cotton
textiles, aluminum, steel tubes, plastics, wire rope, hand tools and fish
products. Although this may be fortuitous, the 1969 slow-down in the
increase of India's exports of engineering goods seems not to have affected
ICICI clients. Recent ICICI studies of data provided by its clients also
indicate that, after allowying for the effect of indirect taxes and
duties, a number of Indian products have a canpetitive cost structure, for
instance wiTre rods, certain batteries, polyethylene and some paper products.
Other goods, such as wire ropes, cables and railway wagons do not
offer such a favorable picture.
35.       Taught by the recession, and departing from earlier times when mere
import substitution seemed sufficient, ICICI has moved towards focusing on
enhancing its clientsr competitive strength. In 1968 and 1969, quite a
number of projects have been approved for improvements in process technology
including more efficient uses of raw and izaste materials (Zenith Steel,
TELCO, Ballarpur Paper, Owalior Rayon).  Other projects were for backward
integration (e.g. Sylvania and Laxman) or the streamlining of clients'
productive facilities (e.g. India Paper& Pulp). ICICI's success in pursuing
the improvement of efficiencies, rather than of just adding to capacity,
is encouraging. Considerably more needs to be done in this area.
Quality of Portfolio
36.       The manufacturers of capital and intermediary goods, which form
an important portion of ICICI's borrowers, were especially hard hit by the
recession of 1966/67. Some of them have so far not been able to recover,
and a few will possibly not be able to recover at all. Among them are pro-
ducers of electrical meters, insulators, wire ropes and spun pipes. (Pro-
ducers of electrical equipment had sales problems even before the recession.)
Restrictive Government licensing policies, and also lack of initiative and
capital, prevented many of those firms from diversifying into other more
promising production lines. The consequence has been a high level of
arrears in ICICI's portfolio. During 1969, arrears improved in the wake
of better economic conditions. The position on December 31, 1969 is sum-
marized below:

1/1/66)                             (61)      (228.3)        (26.1)

c. Loans having difficult or
irregular debt service but not
in arrears at present                15         21.6           2.5
(of which rescheduled since
1/1/66)                              (8)       (13.1)         (1.5)
d. Total loans in arrears of
interest and/or principal            40        125.1          14.3
(of which rescheduled since
1/1/66)                             (20)       (88.0)        (10.1)
37.       Among the 40 loans in arrears, amounts actually overdue as at
December 31, 1969, were Rs. 22.6 million in principal (2.6% of the out-
standing portfolio) and Rs. 11.4 million in interest. For comparison, on
December 31, 1967, the aggregate of loans in arrears amounted to Rs. 161.1
million; however, the amounts actually overdue were then only Rs. 17.6
million on principal and Rs. 10.3 million on interest.  If "short" arrears
of less than 90 days are excluded, the percentage of loans in arrears de-
creases from 14.3% to 12% of total portfolio, which is still quite high.
Nearly half of the arrears is in the depressed sectors mentioned above.
Borrowers of several loans in arrears may not survive. Deducting loans for
which ICICI holds good bank guarantees, ICICI's exposure in projects where
significant losses could occur, totalled only Rs. 30 million (3.5% of port-
folio) as at December 31, 1969, compared  mith Rs. 46 million on June 30,
1969. Altogether, arrears in ICICI's loan portfolio at the end of 1969
called for watchfulness but need not cause special concern.
38.       Relevant to the foregoing is the fact that, as noted in paragraph 36,
to accommodate companies hard-hit by the recession, ICICI rescheduled a large
number of its loans in the past three years. As a result, total rescheduled
loans represented, at the end of 1969, 26% of ICICI's outstanding loans (21%
as of June 30, 1969). The decrease in arrears in the recent past might not
have occurred if ICICI had granted no relief through rescheduling. ICICI's
portfolio of securities contains investments (at cost) of Rs. 4.4 million
in four of the projects in difficulties (amounting to Rs. 30 million) to
which ICICI had also made loans.
1/  Tnis figu2e is not identical bul> veiy- close to the bclance sheet
figure for December 31, 1969.



- 13 -
39.       in addition to its loan portfolio ICICI's investments included
the following items on December 31, 1969:
Book value
(Rs million)
Government securities and
debentures                                12.1
Securities of industrial concerns
- debentures                  134.3
- preference shares             50.9
- ordinary shares               91.1     276.3
288.4
About 90% of these investments, or Rs. 252.8 million, were quoted on the
stock market, but some have not been traded for a long while. The real
value of these investments may therefore be somewhat higher than the
Rs. 261.9 million shown in ICICI's 1969 accounts.  Among its investments
in shares, about 40% investments seem to be of excellent or good quality,
with about 50% appreciation over book value; oIn tLle other hand, investments
accounting for about 15% of ICICI's holdings are poor and their market
value would at best be about 30-40% of book value. Altogether, it appears
that ICICI's security portfolio is sound.
IV. FINANCLL-T POSITION AND RESULTS
40.       ICICI's accounts have always been audited by the chartered
accounting firms N.M. Raiji & Co. (Bombay) and Ray & Ray (Calcutta). The
accounts have always been approved without qualifications.
41.       Comparative balance sheets, from 1965 to December 31, 1969, are
shown in Aunnex 15. Due to the recession, after assets grew by 15% in 1967,
the rate\dropped to 1.4% during 1968.  Total assets increased by 9% in
1969. Tie ratio of all debt to equity, wqhich had reached a peak of 9.2:2
at the end of 1967, declined to 8.7:1 as at December 31, 1968 and 8.6:1 as
at December 31, 1969. The debt/equity ratio as defined in Loan Agreement
515-IN was 7.4:1 at the end of 1969 as against a stipulated limit of 9:1. zi
At that tine, ICICI could then assume additional debt of Rs. 170 million
($26.7 million).
42.       Income statements for the past five years are shown in Annex 16.
A condensed presentation and analysis for the last three years followls:

(including guarantees)to not more thmn nine tinid  ICICI's share canital,
reserves and that part of the first Government loan falling due after
any of ICICI's sub-loans with IBRD funds are repaid to ICICI.

Administrative expenses                    0.26      0.26      0.31

Profit before tax                          2.4       2.3       2.3
43.       On the whole, ICICI's pre-tax profits have remained remarkably
stable over the past five years. The variation in income and expenses in
relation to total assets has been small and no particular trend can be de-
duced from them.  However, the average costs of ICICI's rupee borrowings
increased from about 4% in 1966 to 4.5% in 1969; for foreign currency bor-
rowings, average costs increased from 5.7% in 1965 to about 6% in 1969.
There hlas recently been a trend of rising financial expenses; and costs are
likely to increase more quickly in tile future. The increase in administra-
tive expenses reflects the recent expansion in ICICI's activities, offices
and staff (see paragraph 12).
Reserves
44.       As a percentage of total outstanding loans and security portfolio,
reserves amounted to 4% at the end of 1967, 4.6% at the end of 1968 and
1/  These provisions were made exclusively against doubtful current
assets (i.e. interest on loans accrued but not paid by ICICIts bor-
rowers). Indian tax laws do not permit constitution of tax-free
provisions for future losses. However, ICICI started building up
a reserve for bad debts out of taxed net profits in 1967; this
reserve now stands at Rs. 6 million.



- 15 -
5.4% at the end of 1969. ICICI's cumulative reserves at the end of 1969
amounted to Rs. 61.7 million (82% of share capital). Less than 10% of these
reserves (Rs. 6 million) were earmarked against doubtful debts. This ear-
marked portion does not represent true provisions however,IICI' s entire reserves,
and for that matter its net worth, are available as a cushion for bad debts.
As indicated in paragraph 35, ICICI would probably, at worst, face a loss on
loans of perhaps Rs. 30 million. The possibility of a loss of Rs. 30 million
is, however, extreme; for the amount would be reduced substantially by sales
of the security for these loans. In other words, although the reserves
specifically marked for doubtful loans seem very small, ICICI's present re-
serves (and certainly net worth) seem sufficient to cover foreseeable losses.
In addition, there is some cushion in capital gains if ICICI decided to sell
more of its good investments in shares and debentures. Given past experience,
however, ICICI should increase its net worth faster than recently. A higher
spread ii;hich is expected to result from an increase in the rate of foreign
currency loans between the costs of ICICI's borrowed and lent funds should help
in this regard.
Market Quotation
45.       ICICI's shares were quoted modestly over par value during 1969,
with a total turnover of approximately 21,000 shares (4% of total share
capital).  Recently(l%iy 14 ) the quotation went to Rselll   1/. At the
present price, the share yield amounts to 8.1%.
V. THE OUTLOOK
Industrial Investment Perspectives
46.       Though a Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-74) has just been endorsed by
India's National Development Council, the lessons of the Third Plan, during
which the recession wrought havoc with targets, are such as to put only
general value on the new targets. Anyway, the new Plan focuses primarily on
public sector outlays.
47.       There are some immediate economic factors which justify a reason-
ably optimistic outlook for private industrial investment. Some of these
have already been working in recent months. Leading among these factors are
three good harvests in a row. Despite the likely overcapacity for some time
among several capital goods producers (especially heavy engineering and trans-
port equipment plants around Calcutta), other sectors need capacity expansion.
This need is based on growing demand, most notably for certain steels, paper,
artificial fiber, agriculture machinery and durable consumer goods. There
is also pressure on the capacity of Indian shipping lines and, with the
likelihood of stepped-up fertilizer capacity additions, prospects are favor-
able for investments in petrochemicals. In general, import substitution is
continuing and, as India's industrial installation ages and technology ad-
vances, there is need for replacements and cost-saving equipment.

iJ8.      There are, however, still some elements which may damroen 'ihe
enthusiasm of private investors. TWo are political. One, of three years'
standing, is the difficult and intractable labor situation in the indus-
trialized east, mostly in the State of t.,Jest Bengal. (Recently imposed
Presidential Rule may help stabilize the situation.) Another is the uncer-
tainties stemming from the fact that some State Governments pursue policies
not entirely conforming to those of the Center. There may also be a
restraining factor resulting from recovery itself: a sudden increase in
demand for imported raw materials unmatched by foreign exchange availabilities
or by the given framework of Import policies.
49.       All things considered, however, the upswing in the Indian economy
and domestic market factors seem strong enough to induce further industrial
investments in the private sector.
ICICI's Business Prospects and Resource Needs
50.       ICICI has forecast its total commitments at about Rs. 312 million
in 1970. This is somewhat less than the 1969 peak when the earlier large
amount of transactions approved but not committed was matezally reduced.
For the years through 1974,, IICI expects that favorable economic conditions
will prevail; that there will be continued demand for its assistance,
especially foreign exchange; and that given these factors, and the rate at
which it processes projects, commitments will grow yearly by about 8-11% .
As discussed in paragraph 52, a pipeline of projects, either already approved
or being processed, supports ICICI's business expectations well in 1971.
These projects fall in good measure into those sectors which offer attractive
demand prospects. Some of the projects may involve substantial participation
by national term-financing institutions which are in the public sector.
ICICI's Articles permit financing of such projects. Those Articles do not,
however, permit ICICI to finance projects sponsored by Government or Governrnert
crompanies.
51.       Barring particularly unfavorable developments in the future, ICICI
forecasts of future commitments are a reasonable basis for assessing its
financial projections. A summary of ICICI's projected operations in 1970-74,
compared with recent experience, follows (in Rs. million):
Actual
1968   1799    1970    1971    1972    1973    1974
Approvals                310.3   300.2   370.0   400O0 0 435.0  468.0   522.0
Commitments              189.3   328.2   311.8   357.3   403.3   439.1   478.3
(of which for-
eign exchange)         (93.8) (255.7) (170.4) (183.7) (210.8) (228.0) (241.5)
Disbursements            165.3   181.5   278.3   328.2   364.4   392.0   442.6
Over the period, disbursements (which for 1970 and 1971 are forecast on a
recent case-by-case examination of projects under way) are expected to grow
more quickly thanapprovals and comnmitments. This growth may have been
estimated at somewhat too rapid a rate, but it is reasonable to expect that
the earlier large gap between approvals and disbursements noted in paragraph
26 will be reduced in the future.

52.       Against forecast rupee commitments in 1970 of about Rs. 1b2
million, ICICI had committed through mid-May 1970 Rs. 68.4 million, in-
cluding Rs. 21.8 million in direct loans. As of May 12, 1970, projects
under consideration amounted to Rs. 59 million (including Rs. 23 million
in direct loans). More proposals are expected and it is probable that
ICICI will again be able, after the 1969 drop, to play a more significant
role in financing rupee needs of Indian industry. Against forecast foreign
exchange commitments in 1970 of $22.7 million, ICICI had already committed
about $6.6 million through May 14, 1970. On that date, ICICI's foreign
exchange resources still available for commitments amounted to t1. 5 million,
of which $8.7 million was from the Bank. It is likely that these Bank funds
will be fully committed this summer. In addition. ICICI has, at this time,
already approved in principle foreign currency loans of $21 million, and it is
considering additional projects for about $17 million. Even if some
casualties occur, there are likely to be sufficient projects to support
ICICI's forecast commitment during the balance of 1970 and in 1971.
53.       Even if ICICI did not have a large project pipeline, it should
have good foreign exchange business prospects. On present expectations,
India may in the period 1970-71 receive foreign aid from various countries
of the order of about $50 million to finance "miscellaneous capital goods"2J
used by industry. If, as before, IBRD met the bulk of ICICI's foreign
exchange needs, ICICI with untied funds would continue to be an attractive
source of import financing, because most other aid streams for capital
goods are tied to national procurement sources.
5.       Foreign exchange commitment should total nearly 4138 million in
1970-75. At the beginning of the period, ICICI had committable resources
of about $21 million. This amount, taking account of developments through
May l4, 1970 should finance ICICIls commitments for another four to five
months.  Resourcesneeded to cover estimated foreign exchange commitments
through the summer of 1972 amount to about $h6 million. Daring that
period, ICICI can probably obtain another $3 million from KfiJ and $2.b
million from a U.K. credit to the Government. For the balance of its
needs - about $h0 million - ICICI looks to the Bank.
55.       ICICI will also have to replenish its rupee resources.
while repayments, retained earnings and proceeds from in-
vestment sales, are likely to contribut about Rs. 530 million,
U/ Including: I9RD $8.7 million

2 This is the classification the Indian Government applies to foreign
aid in the form of loans to institutions like ICICI, or for issuance

- la -
ICICI will need to borrow, starting in 19729 another Rs. 1400 miLllon through
1974.(Annex 17 gives details). This is a substantial borrowing program
and I0ICI may have to make a considerable effort to achieve it. ICICI also
plans on a share capital increase by one-third (Rs. 25 million) in 1971,
which will be needed both to   maintain    ICICI0s own equity investments
and to strengthen its borrowing base 2 .
Financial Projections
56.       ICICI's forecasts through 1974 are ref lcted in the
financial projections shown in Annexes 18 to 20. These projections assuirme
the availability of the resources called for.
_7.       Over the next five years, ICICIts profitability trend is projected
in line with the results achieved over the past two or three years.( They
do not take into account income from a higher Interest rate
on foreign currency loans. ) Absolutely, net profits in 1970 may drop from
1969 by about Rs. 3 million, because of higher administrative and personnel
expenses following ICICI's recent staff and office expansions. These expenses
will rise suddenly to Rs. 7 million from the actual Rs. 4.9 million in 1969.
Still, allowing for further gradual increases through 1974, administrative
expenses will remain at about 0.4% of average total assets in 19714  After
1970, net profits are expected to grow by about 10-15% per ann-un. A summary
of ICICI's projected income and expense statement follows (in Rs. million):

Taking account of capital gains, the above projections indicate a stable
rate of return on net worth at about 11% in each of the five years from
1970 to 1974. Dividends, projected at 9%, will leave on the average about
Rs. 10-14 million per year for appropriation to reserves.
58.       The  1969 balance sheet and those projected for the period
1970-74 are summarized below (in Rs. million):

The above projections show a current ratio hovering above two and a
debt/equity ratio (as defined in Loan Agreement 515-IN) remaining below the
agreed limit of 9:1 (after the proposed share capital increase in 1971 by
Rs. 25 million).  If the Bank made another loan of $40 million as requested,
its contribution to ICICI's resources (as shoLn in the balance sheet) is
estimated to rise from 37% at the end of 1969 to somewhat over 50% in 197h.
This is a substantial addition.
59.       As indicated in paragraph 50, ICICI assumes that favorable eco-
nomic circumstances will prevail through 1974. The projections also rest
on the expectation of favorable capital market conditions. Even if these
general assumptions are proved right, one imrrportant element invites caution.
As Indian laws af2ord no tax exemptioin for them, no provisions



- 20 -
for losses are foreseen in ICICI's projections. Hcsever, ICICI cannot
bank on avoiding losses.  ICICI has advised the Bank that to safeguard
against lossess it will in the future estimate ,annually
how much of its reserves should be earmarked against specifically
estimated loss possibilities. These "Provisions" will not be counted
in the borrowing base established under  CICI   loan agreement with the
Bank.
60.       ICICI has been quite liquid follawing the bond issue of October
1969. It expects over the next five years a cumulative decrease of cash
and short-term investments by Rs. 64 million, primarily because it intends
to invest more rapidly in equities. Debt service coverage projections on
principal are comfortable and interest service coverage would rezain above
1.1 throughout the next five years. Over the life of a new Bank loan, the
effects of long grace periods and terms on ICICI's earlier rupee borrowings
will diminish. But if ICICI continues matching its maturities on foreign
exchange borrowings and loans, and lends rupees oil average terms of 10
years and continues to borrow them over 15 years, ICICI's debt service
coverage should remain comfortable.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
61.       ICICI has been able to withstand the difficult years of the
recession. This has not occurred without paying a price in the form of
a weakened portfolio. Reserves are sufficient to cover portfolio losses
that can now be foreseen. Since mid-1968, ICICI has been vigorous in
seeking new business through large projects from well-established com-
panies. ICICI took this initiative to offset a decline in earning
assets resulting from the recession-induced drop in its foreign exchange
business and to counteract the deterioration in its portfolio. Though
improvements in the economy have recently resulted in more applications,
ICICI continues its pursuit of big clients who operate in the "core" and
heavy investment sectors. But to have a wider developmental effect, and
to counter growing criticism for not doing enough in this area, ICICI
knows that it must develop more schemes that may result in significant
assistance, without sacrificing project standards, to smaller entrepreneurs.
The opening of two branch offices is a step towards giving substance to
10CICI's role as an institution serving all of India. How effective it will
be in expanding ICICI's business remains to be seen. As in the past,
1CICI gives strong support to equity investments, balancing the demands
of prudence and of supporting new projects.
62.       In the past year, ICICI's appraisal and follow-up work have
improved. But the pressures on ICICI are strong to improve even more
and discussions to that end took place during loan negotiations. ICICI
must sharpen its inquiry into the long-range competitiveness of its clients.
Such inquiry must focus on production costs in relation to other enter-
prises in India as well as on values and markets of comparable commodities
traded internationally. Secondly, judgments must be made on the ability
of clients to withstand difficult periods in carrying out projects and in
achieving sales at home and abroad. Thirdly, as technology and the
Indian industrial structure change, ICICI must give more weight to its
clients' ability to adapt to new situations. ICICI itself needs to keep
its staff constantly up-to-date with industrial developments in the world.
This means continued training, even for IICI's experienced staff. Though
not eager to depart from established operating patterns, ICICI has shown
a willingness to try new or to refine its present approaches. It should
be able to cope with future tasks.
63.       The time needed to obtain import licenses and in carrying
foreign currency loans to the point of commitment has become increasingly
long over the past year. ICICI used to hold contact with Delhi to a
minimum on its clients' license applications. Experience in 1969 showed
that this posture resulted in a large amount of ICII approvals with little
chance of early commitments.  Early project appraisals were thus practically
useless. Though judiciousness is needed, ICICI should continue its recent



- 22 -
initiatives in Delhi to help clients obtain governmental permissions
for projects. Such contacts are useful not only to the clients, but also
to ICICI for they build a helpful image for the institution; they are
also useful to Government officers, who are thus exposed to ICICI's
practical experience.
64.       Recent political changes, including the new industrial licensing
policies, are not likely to have any effect in the next year or so on
ICICI's business. In that period, ICICI's Board and management should
probably not change significantly.Over the longer run, the effect of
recent political changes on ICICI cannot be foreseen. However, under what-
ever Board or management, ICICI must maintain a satisfactory performance
because only in such circumstances can it count on the continued support
of international institutions, important to ICICI and to India.
65.       Though ICICI's present financial position is satisfactory, it
must protect itself against the effects of increases in the cost of
resources. To protect its profitability, to add prudently to reserves
and to strengthen its borrowing base, ICICI should increase its interest
rate. A rate increase on rupee loans may be difficult unless credit con-
tinues tight in India. An increase may be easier on foreign currency
loans. Such an increase may also be advisable in order to price more
realistically a scarce and very attractive resource. ICICI has taken
note of this point and proposes to adjust its interest rate on foreign
currency loans.
Recommendations
66.       ICICI's projections over the next five years show a steady growth
in business and the need for sizeable additional resources, probably about
Rs. 1.8 billion ($240 million). With appropriate efforts fresh rupee
resources are expected to be available from borrowings and from a share
capital increase in 1971. Foreign exchange commitments through the
summer of 1972 exceed committable resources by about $46 million. Some
$5-6 million are expected to become available from German and British
sources. In the absence of other sources, ICICI again looks to IBRD to
provide the bulk of its foreign exchange requirements. ICICI continues
to be a suitable and creditworthy borrower. A Bank loan of up to $40
million would be appropriate at this time to cover ICICI's needs for about
two years, through the summer of 1972. Such a loan would raise somewhat,
but not unduly, the Bank's already substantial contribution to ICICI's
resources.
67.       The terms of the proposed loan should generally follow those of
recent Bank loans to development finance companies, except that the free
limit regime should be different. As ICI0I is a development finance
company which the Bank has known well over 15 years, and which as demon-
strated its capacity to use capital effectively and to maintain a good
financial record, only those of ICICI's investment projects should require
the approval of the Bank which need more than $4 million of ICICI's resources,
including Bank loan funds.

IIDUSTRIkL iC1i'Sl.-SIG POLICY
GOVERNNENTIS DECISIO11   AkIIJOU CED C3. EBRUAR'Y I8, 1970 I1J iEW DELHI
In recent nonths the Government has been carefully exarining
the changes necessary in its policies relating to industrial development,
in the light of the recommendations of the Adnministrative Reforms Cormission,
the Industrial Licensing Policy Inquiry CormLittee and of the Planning
Comnission. It has been decided to make certain changes in (a) Industrial
Licensing Policy; (b) the policy in regard to assistance from public
financial institutions; and (c) the policies relating to the growth of
the public sector.
LICENSING POLICY
Government has accepted the recoriviendation of the Industrial
Licensing Policy Inquiry Comrr'ittee that there should be a list of core
industries consisting of basic, critical and strategic industries in
the economry. Detailed industry plans will be prepared for these industries
and essential inputs riade available on a priority basis. Care will be
taken to ensure that an adequate proportion of foreign exchange is kept
apart for non-core industries also. A list of core industries has
been drawn up by the Planning Corziission in consultation with the econor;ic
;!iinistries in the light of the production gaps that have to be closed
in the course of the Fourth Plan. The list is attached at Annexure I '.
Such of the industries in the 'core  list as are included in Schedule A
of the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956 (as amended from tirre to timrre)
will continue to be reserved for the public sector. In addition to the
core sector, all new investment propositions of over Rs. 5 crores shall
be deemred to be in the "heavy investment" sector. Except for industries
reserved for the public sector under the Industrial Policy Resolution,
1956, as ar.ended from tirme to tinne, undertakings belonging to the
Larger Industrial Houses, as defined in the report of the Industrial
Licensing Policy Inquiry Committee, together with foreign concerns and
subsidiaries or branches of foreign companies, would be expected,
along with other applicants, to participate in and contribute to the
establishment of industries in the core and heavy investment sectors,
leaving the opportunities in the remaining sectors primarily to other
classes of entrepreneurs. The joint sector concept, suggested in the ILPIC
report, has been accepted in principle. It will be Governmentts endeavour
to apply the concept in the case of major projects taken up by private
enterprise groups in the two sectors referred to above, as may be appropriate.
In the middle sector, involving investments ranging frorL Rs. 1 crore to
Rs. 5 crores, licence applications of parties other than undertakings
belonging to the Larger Industrial llouses shall be given special consideration
and shall be issued liberally, except where foreign exchange imiplications
necessitate careful scrutiny. Licence applications from undertakings
belonging to or controlled by the Larger Industrial Groups and foreign
branches/subsidiaries, shall be considered for normial expansion, where
. . ./. ..



Page 2
such expansion is necessary to develop to a rolnirmum economic level
which would ensure greater cost efficiency. The pr:ovisions of the iionopo:ias
and Restrictive Trade Practices Act will be taken into acccumt.
Government has accepted the criteria for the classification
of finrms belonging to the Larger Industrial IHouses, as evolved by the
Industrial Licensing Policy Inquiry Comrittee and stated in para 2,
16 of its report. It is, however, recognised that changes are bound to
take place, fromi; time to time, in classifications of this type. For example,
when the Lanaging Agency syster± ceases to be in force as from April 3
1970, the list of corpanies and concerns owned or controlled by the Larger
Industrial Houses may possibly  require sorLe modifications.  The Departnern4
of Corrpany Affairs will be the agency for making such modifications and
changes and for keeping the list authoritative and up-to-date.
Those individual companies or undertakings who consider that
their inclusion in the list of the 20 Larger Industrial Houses is incorrect.
riay represent to the Department of Company Affairs who will consl tute
the administrative authority to determine and pronounce on the issue.
Similarly, a suitable procedure will be adcpted for making additions
to the list in the light of the criteria adopted by Government.
Small-Scale Sector: The existing policy of reservation for the small
scale sector, (involving investment in machinery and equipxiient up to
Rs. 7.5 lakhs) will be continued and the area of such reservation will
be extended, wherever production in this sector can be expected to grow
to adequately meet deriand. The first list of industries to which the
reservation will be extended has been prepared by the Planning Commission
in consultation with the linistry of Industrial Development. Reservation
tinll be extended to the industri.es in this list which is in Annexure "II".
Cooperative Sector: In respect of agro-industries, particularly undertaking;:
processinL; sugar cane, jute and other agricultural comrJodities, preference
will be given in licensing to applicants froml the cooperative sector.
Exemption Lirit: The exemption limLit from licensing provisions including
licensing of new undertakings and substantial expansion of existing units
will be raised from Rs. 25 lakhs to Rls. 1 crore (by way of fixed assets
in land, buildings and iiachinery) in the cases of undertakings or categories
of undertakinEs which have existing assets of less than Rs. 5 crores and
which (i) do not belong to the Larger Industrial Houses, as classified
by the Industrial Licensing Policy Inquiry Commiittee; (ii) do not require
more than Re. 10 lakhs or more than 10 per cent by way of foreign exchange
for import of i71achinery and equipnent, whichever is less and do not also
require foreign cx(hELxp except marginally., for import of raw materials,
com.ponents and the like and (iii) are not included in the category of
'dominant undertakings' as defined in the lIonopolies Act.  There will be
no commitment on the part of Government to provide foreign exchange for
maintenance and raw material iTports for units which benefit from the
exemption froa- licensing.

Plag  3
Re-licensing: lWith the exemption l1U-it for licensing being raised to
Rs. 1 crore, and in view of the other pollcy objectives sought to be
achieved, the existing exeniption of a nur;lber of industries from licensing
requirements will be withdrawn. Applicants who wish to set up industrial
units in industries which w-ere de-licensed so far, will hence-forth
have to apply fcr a licence in accordance with the new policy.
Ex'oort Oriented Industries: Government has recognised the need for an
adequate orientation of licensing policy in order to step up the export
effort. Guidelines in this regard will be prepared by the iiinistry of
Industrial Development in consultation with the Udnistry of Foreign Trade
and will be announced thereafter.
Implementation:  Li,ecessary instructions and notifications will be issued
by the inistry of Industrial Development to give effect to these decisions.
A set of guidelines will be issued to the Licensing Committee to keep in
mind these decisions and other related objectives of industrial developrment.
in dealing with new applications for licences.
Public Financial Institutions: W;ith the acceptance of the joint-sector
concept in principle, it will be ensured in future that there is a greater
degree of participation in management, particularly at policy levels, in
the case of Xiajor projects involving substantial assistance from public
financial institutions. Public financ:.sal institutions will also, as
part of their financial assistance arrangements, exercise option for
converting loans given and debentures issued in future, either wholly
or partly, into equit-i within a specified period of tine.  As for loans
and debentures given in the past, the financial institutions concerned
would have discretion to negiotiate conversion in cases of default.
The Departnent of Banking izill be issuinr  necessary instructions in
this regard.
Role of the Public Sector: Alon-side of the measures taken to reduce the
concentratlon of econoric power, the scope of the public sector is proposed.
to be substantially expanded, beyond the fields included in the Industrial
Policy Resolution of 1956. Various production Iinistries will examine the
possibility of taking up short gestation projects yielding quick returns
so as to cover, to the extent feasible, major production gaps likely
to develop in various industrial sectors in the nex few years. In order
to meet the resources requirements for an expanded public sector programme,
it has been decided in principle that the public financial institutions
should be authorised to consider applications for financial assistance
for projects to be set up in the public sector on the sane ter.rs as
applications from private parties. The Department of Banking would issue
necessary instructions in this regard after detailed exarInation.
