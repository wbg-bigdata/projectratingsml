FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrower:           The Republic of Turkey
Beneficiaries:      The Undersecretariat of the Treasury and Foreign Trade,
the Central Bank, the Capital Market Board, the Board of
Sworn Bank Examiners, the Board of Sworn Financial
Advisers and the commercial banks.
Amount:             US$300 million equivalent
Terms:              Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
Description:        The proposed loan would support the Government's financial
sector adjustment program during the two-year period
1986-88. The principal objectives of the program are to
establish an efficient and flexible system of resource
mobilization and allocation, which would respond rapidly
to market forces and would offer a wide variety of
financial instruments to both borrowers and savers. The
principal measures to be taken would include: (i) the
reduction of subsidies on preferential credit and
achievement of positive real interest rates for
preferential credit to the productive sectors;
(ii) standardization of accounts and introduction of
external audit of commercial banks, along with
strengthening of bank supervision; (iii) development of
the capital market through reform of the regulatory
framework including introduction of external audit of
corporations; and (iv) development and introduction of new
financial services. Simultaneously, the institutional
capacities of the major agencies in the sector adjustment
process would be strengthened by provision of technical
assistance at a total foreign exchange cost of
$3.0 million.
The loan would finance all imports with the exception of
items financed by other sources, military or para-military
items, luxury goods and nuclear reactors.

- ii -
Benefits and Risks:      The reforms agreed under the loan will help to create
a more efficient financial sector and thus enhance
growth, both by increasing savings and by channelling
them to more productive investments. In particular,
by developing a greater variety of financial
instruments, the reforms would contribute to a revival
of private investment. The main risk arises due to
uncertainties in the control of inflation, as the
persistence of high levels of inflation is a major
constraint to the reduction of the prevailing high
interest rates and consequent corporate financial
distress. This risk is mitigated by the Government's
determination to pursue sound macro-economic
policies. Other risks relate to the prospects for the
rapid development of the capital markets, and the
degree of resistance that might be encountered in the
introduction of external audit of banks and
corporations. Both sets of risks are considered
manageable in view of the progress already made and
the Government's commitment to the reform program.
Estimated
Disbursements:           The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in two
tranches, $200 million equivalent soon after
effectiveness, and $100 million after a performance
review expected to be carried out in July 1987.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent
of US$300 million to support the Government's program of reforms in the
financial sector designed to make the sector more efficient and better able to
fulfill its role of fostering economic growth. The loan would have a term of
17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard variable
rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey: The Vth Five-Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.       Turkey's area is about 781,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a population of around
50 million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984. The density of population is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more
recently, to the Middle East), there is still substantial unemployment which,
including disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about
19 percent of the civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no
absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There are
considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable increase in income inequality
since the 1970s, especially a relative deterioration of the position of wage
and salary earners and an improvement in the position of the trading and
commercial classes, and, more generally, of capital-owners. Educational
enrollment has expanded greatly, but the level of adult literacy remains
relatively low compared to the European average for middle income countries.

Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioraLion in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize imports, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
front, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five Structural Adjustment Loans and an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan,
involves far-reaching changes in attitudes, institutions, and the legal and
policy framework, all of which require time to be put in place. Major
structural changes have been made in the exchange rate system, the export and
import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and selective credit policies
and the public investment program. Implementation of the adjustment program
started in January 1980, continued under a military regime during the period
September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been carried out by an elected
government.
The Structural Adjustment Program, 1980-85
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and the outcome met or exceeded the Government's
own targets through 1982. The overall performance deteriorated in 1983 due to
a combination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages in the monetary
program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved again, except in the
area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The improvement was
maintained in 1985, this time including a slowdown in inflation and a
reduction in the budget deficit.
8.       After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.7 percent growth) and industry (9.3 percent growth).



-3-
Merchandise exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar
terms. In 1985, according to the latest estimates, the economy grew by about
4.9 percent, as against the program target of 5.5 percent. The slowdown in
growth was most significant in agriculture (2.2 percent growth) and
manufacturing (5.5 percent), due respectively to less favorable climatic
conditions and slackening domestic demand. On the expenditure side, the
average annual real rate of growth of public fixed investment over the period
1980-84 was 3.8 percent. Provisional estimates for 1985 indicate that public
fixed investment totalled TL 3,289 billion, implying a much higher real growth
(12.8 percent) over 1984 than programmed (5.8 percent). However, the size of
public investment is overestimated for two reasons: (i) the increase in local
currency cost of outstanding foreign debt due to devaluation is included in
the investment figures for ongoing projects; and (ii) interest costs incurred
by ongoing projects are also added to public investment. Rough calculations
indicate that these could add up to as much as 30 percent of the total
investment figure for 1985 cited above. The growth rate of private investment
has fluctuated more severely, falling by 17 percent in 1980, recovering
slowly, and then rising by 7.1 percent in both 1984 and 1985. Private
consumption, after declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by
5 percent in 1983 and 1984 before slowing down to an estimated 3.8 percent in
1985. Strict budgetary discipline contributed to a steady decline in the real
rate of growth of public consumption from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent
in 1983; however, it increased to 3.2 percent in 1984 and an estimated
3.3 percent in 1985.
9.       During 1981-82, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in the wholesale price index (WPI) decelerated to 37 percent
in 1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and
the inflation rate rose to 30 percent. Inflation accelerated further in 1984,
and reached 50 percent, due to the lagged impact of the expansionary monetary
policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant increase in
agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and vegetables, as a
consequence of export liberalization and higher export market prices. Other
contributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases of SEE prices -
since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to set their prices
freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal depreciation of
the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed from a larger
than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a slowdown in the
growth of revenues.
10.      In 1985 inflation declined considerably -- the average annual rate of
increase in the WPI fell to 43.2 percent, after reaching a very high level in
the first quarter of 1985 (about 60 percent as of March 1985). By
December 1985, the month-over-month change in the WPI (i.e. December 1985 over
December 1984) had correspondingly declined to 38.3 percent and by March 1986
it had dipped even further, dropping to below 30 percent for the first time in
two and half years. Factors causing the high inflation rate in the first
quarter of 1985 were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) in
January 1985 and continued substantial increases in the prices of several key



- 4 -
intermediate goods and inputs. Thereafter, several factors combined to lower
inflationary pressures: (i) monetary growth slowed, particularly in the
fourth quarter, with M2 growth declining from an annual rate of 64 percent as
of September 1985 to 53 percent at year-end; (ii) by April 1985 most of the
catch-up increases in the prices of SEE products appeared to have been
completed and the rate of price adjustment abated considerably; (iii) the
significant slide of the dollar, which started after March 1985, resulted in a
slowing down of the nominal depreciation of the Turkish lira against the
dollar and therefore in smaller increases in prices of imported products than
were witnessed in 1983-84; (iv) the persistence of high real interest rates
(which increased as inflation declined) helped to channel liquidity towards
savings rather than consumption and thus lowered aggregate demand; and
(v) lower exports of certain agricultural products (cereals and pulses) meant
that the domestic market was well supplied, thus easing inflationary pressures
on food prices. The steady deceleration in the inflation rate, which has now
continued for over 12 months, reinforces the expectation that the Government's
target rate of 25 percent for 1986 could be achieved, particularly considering
the large decline in world oil prices since January 1986, the continued
weakening of the dollar relative to other international currencies, and the
Government's maintenance of a tight monetary and fiscal program.
11.      In the fiscal area, progress has been uneven.  During 1980-82 the
budget deficit declined from 5.3 to 2.1 percent of GNP, but increased to
almost 5 percent of GNP in 1984, due mainly to a disappointing performance in
raising tax revenues. In 1985, however, the budget deficit is estimated to
have been TL 621 billion or 2.3 percent of GNP, a significant improvement over
1984. This is largely because the Government took several measures in 1985 to
increase revenues, the most important of which was the introduction of VAT.
In its first year, VAT collections amounted to about TL 1 trillion,
significantly above the target. Other tax measures which were adopted
included substantial increases in various fixed charges and duties and large
increases in penalties for overdue tax payments. As a result of these
measures, budget revenues rose from 15.4 percent of GNP in 1984 to 17 percent
in 1985, reversing the downward trend in revenues over the previous three
years. Government expenditures decreased from 20.3 percent of GNP in 1984 to
an estimated 19.3 percent in 1985.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system. Since 1981, interest rates on time deposits at
commercial banks have been positive in real terms. Positive deposit interest
rates have resulted in a steady growth in deposits, about 10 percent per annum
in real terms in 1984 and 1985. Improvements in incentives for savings were
accompanied by administrative reforms of the banking system and the enactment
of a new banking law. Other important developments in the financial sector
include measures undertaken to revitalize the capital market discussed in
Part IV of this report.
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 60 to 80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the impact of high liquidity and reserve requirements, the option which



commercial banks have to invest in high-yielding government bonds, and high
intermediation costs. The Government took a number of steps in 1985 to reduce
the interest rate differentials between preferential and non-preferential
credits: in particular, the preferential interest rate for export credits was
discontinued in January 1985, while, during the year, interest rates for
larger agricultural loans and for loans to SEEs were increased from 28 and
22 percent to 34 and 35 percent respectively. The narrowing of the gap
between interest rates on preferential and non-preferential credits, together
with the decrease effected in the amount of preferential credits, is expected
to increase the general availability of credit and exert a downward pressure
on non-preferential interest rates.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982.  In
1983 the current account deficit increased to $1.8 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion. Remittances, too, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 20 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports grew by more than 16 percent to reach $10.8 billion. As a
result of these developments, both the trade and the current account deficits
declined as compared to 1983. Latest estimates for 1985 indicate a further
strong improvement of the balance of payments situation. Merchandise exports
grew by 11.6 percent (in dollar terms) in 1985, while merchandise imports
increased by 8 percent. Among the invisibles, tourism revenues and investment
income from abroad increased significantly compared to 1984 and previous
years. Workers' remittances, on the other hand, declined by 5 percent. The
current account deficit in 1985 is now estimated at about $1.0 billion, or
about 1.9 percent of GNP.
15.     Merchandise export performance has been impressive throughout the
1980-85 period, during which exports registered an average annual rate of
increase of about 23 percent in dollar terms. This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of exports to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods and textiles, have risen from 32 percent of total exports in 1980 to
more than 72 percent in 1985. These results were achieved by a combination of
indirect measures (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization) as
well as direct measures (tax rebates, preferential credits) to enhance the
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the vol,ume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased substantially. The increase was
most prcnounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and consumer goods)
that have been subjected to major liberalization through a lowering of tariff
rat?s and a significant removal of quantitative restrictions.  In 1985, as



domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of pent-up demand for
importables released by import liberalization weakened, the rate of import
growth decreased to about one-half of the level recorded in 1984.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand National Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces. The public
sector is targeted to play a supportive role by concentrating its investments
in infrastructure rather than manufacturing, while the private sector is to be
encouraged to play a leading role in the growth of manufacturing and exports.
Some of the key targets are:
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
t^ around 18 percent in 1989; and
(v)    z decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear somewhat
ambitious and likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public
sector) as well as have an adverse impact on the external balance.
Accordingly, the Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that
they remain compatible with the fight against inflation and with a growth
strategy commensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.      The recent decline in international oil prices is likely to have a
favorable impact on Turkey's balance of payments. The Bank's projections
presented below take into account the most recent decline in oil prices. The
analysis shows that the savings from direct petroleum imports alone could be
about $1.3 billion in 1986. The favorable direct impact would be offset to
some extent by lower export growth to oil-exporting countries (which account
presently for about 40 percent of Turkey's exports) as well as lower profit
and workers' remittances from construction activities in these countries.
However, a compensating increase in Turkish exports to, and workers'
remittances from, OECD countries on account of a more favorable OECD growth
outlook is likely in the medium term. Our estimate puts the net positive
impact of the oil price decline on Turkey's balance of payments at about
$400 million in 1986. There would be indirect benefits as well in the medium
term, including a reduction in the cost of debt servicing as a consequence of
a decline in inflation and interest rates in OECD countries. An improvement



- 7 -
in the balance of payments would give the Government the option of repaying
its external debt sooner, thus improving Turkey's debt service ratio in the
coming years, or using the extra resources to support a faster growth
strategy. Given the uncertainty associated with the oil price projections, we
have been cautious in revising GDP growth targets significantly at this time,
in order to emphasize inflation control and a greater build-up of foreign
exchange reserves.
20.           The Bank's projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.9 percent p.a. on
average for the 1986-90 period. At the beginning, growth might be relatively
slow (5.3 percent p.a.), gradually accelerating in the outer years to an
avexage rate of 6.1 percent p.a. in 1987-90. The inflation targets in the
Bank's projections are also more conservative compared to the Plan targets,
implying a reduction from about 43 percent in 1985 to around 18 percent in
1990. Key economic variables in the Bank's projections for the period 1986-90
are presented in Table 1.

21.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment of about 3.9 percent p.a. on average for the
1986-90 period.  In 'ight of the developments in 1985, this implies a tighter
control of public investment. The comparable figure for the growth of private
fixed investment is 10.6 percent p.a. The projections allow for a modest
increase of per capita consumption of slightly above 3.0 percent p.a. on
average over the period 1986-90.
22.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
8.1 percent per annum in real terms during 1986-90. This assumes the
maintenance of a realistic exchange rate, further import liberalization and
the ability of Turkish exporters to take advantage of higher expected growth
in the OECD market. Merchandise imports are projected to grow at an average
annual r-.te of 7.4 percent. This is consistent with the import liberalization
program of the Government. On these assumptions, the current account deficit
is projected to decrease to $927 million in 1990 as compared to an estimated
1985 figure of $1,013 million. The projected capital account would remain
manageable throughout the period, even in the face of some sharp increases in
amortization payments arising from the debts rescheduled during 1978-80.
23.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a decline in interest rates, the GNP
growth projected in the medium-term base case scenario could be exceeded if
the current account deficit is lowered and there is an improvement in the
mobilization of publ-c resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a downside risk case has also been developed. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such as the
world economic condition. and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of about 6 percent p.a. over the
1986-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources (3 percent
lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would lead to a
more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a lower GDP
growth (averaging about 4.7 percent p.A.) and a higher debt service ratio. In
such a situation the Government would have less chance of absorbing the
unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of living. However, if
the Government in such circumstances were to resort to a high growth strategy,
then it could witness a repeat of the situation which prevailed in the 1970s,
and which led to a debt crisis. It is unlikely that the Government would risk
such a situation.  It is therefore more probable - even if exogeneous
developments are unfavorable - that the Government would continue with the
structural adjustment program as implemented to date.

External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, furkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series uf
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources -- OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks have outstripped those from official sources, reaching
an estimated level of $2.4 billion in 1985. Of the estimated total debt
outstanding of $25.4 billion (including IMF) at end-1985, medium and long-term
debt accounted for about 75 percent.  Short-term debt as a percentage of total
debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about 11 percent in 1982,
then increased to an estimated 25 percent in 1985.  Much of this growth in the
stock of short-term debt is due to the inflcws associated with the Dresdner
Bank scheme. 1/ At end-1985, the outstanding liabilities associated with the
Dresdner scheme amounted to $2.7 billion, constituting 40 percent of
short-term external obligations. Inflows from the Dresdner scheme have been
steadily growing with few withdrawals, which is a reflection of increased
confidence in the Government's economic policies. The Government is
sensitive, however, to the build-up of short-term debt and intends to limit
its share of total debt in the medium term to the present level.  Based on the
growth scenario outlined in paras. 19-22, debt outstanding and disbursed as a
percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an estimated 46 percent in 1985 to
38 percent in 1990. This translates into a forecast of total debt outstanding
in 1990 of $31 billion, with short-term debt constituting about 26 percent of
the total.
26.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estimated 31 percent in 1985, mostly as a
result of large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due. Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.3 billion a year during
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt.  However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
about 25 percent in 1990, due largely to improvements in the current account
of the balance of payments. The debt burden should remain manageable provided
current policies are successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained,
and Turkey continues to receive support from international commercial and
official sources. Confidence in Turkey's overall economic performance, its
stable record in meeting debt servicing obligations and its improved debt
management, encouraged commercial banks to commit about $1.9 billion of
medium-term credits in 1985.  In the first quarter of 1986, nearly
$500 million out of a total of $700 million borrowed from commercial banks
consisted of medium and long-term loans.  Several major American, European,
Japanese and Middle Eastern banks have been involved in these operations.
1/    UJnder this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish
workers in West Germany and automatically places these funds at the
disposition of the Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits
and pays an interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market rate.

27.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of staudby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government did not ask for
a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the view
that the favorable economic developments in 1985 indicate that Turkey has
"graduated" from the IMF's program and that the IMF presence through
Article IV consultations and periodic staff visits to review economic
performance should suffice for purposes of maintaining internatiornal
confidence.
PART II - THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. Structure
28.      The financial system of Turkey comprises (a) the monetary
institutions, i.e. the Central Bank and the commercial banks; (b) the
development banks; (c) the social security system; (d) insurance companies and
credit cooperatives; and (e) the securities markets. Although Government
incentives and the sale of Government bonds have encouraged the development of
a more active securities market in the last few years, the commercial banks
still dominate the financial system. In the early 1980s, commercial banks
accounted for about 65 percent of the total domestic resources mobilized by
the financial system, the Central Bank for 20 percent and other institutions
for 15 percent (Table 2). Of the latter, the share of the social security
system declined steeply from 23 percent in 1970 to less than 10 percent in
1983 as high inflation eroded the real value of its assets. Domestic bonds
issued by the development banks accounted for only 4 percent of the total
domestic liabilities of the Turkish financial system in 1983. The ratio of
total domestic resources of the financial system to GDP declined rapidly from
54 percent of GDP in 1970 to 40 percent in 1981 and then recovered to
48.7 percent in 1985 following the liberalization of deposit interest rates.

29.      Changes in the Government's interest rate policy have had a dramatic
impact on the ability of banks and other institutions to mobilize domestic
resources. Consequently, the depth of the financial system as measured by the
ratio Ma/GDP has fluctuated considerably over the past 15 years as shown in
the following table.

30.      Rising inflation in the 1970s brought returns on all deposits to
increasingly negative levels in real terms. As a consequence, nominal growth
in monetary assets barely kept pace with inflation, and the ratio of M2 to
GDP declined foom 26.1 percent in 1970 to 15.8 percent in 1980. The
authorities effectively lifted ceilings on deposit interest rates in July
1980. Deposit interest rates rose substantially and have remained generally
at positive levels in real terms thereafter.  In response to the interest rate
reform, money balances grew on average by 58 percent per annum in the period
1981-83, while inflation averaged 33 percent per annum. As a result, the
ratio of M2 to GDP increased significantly. Although the ratio in 1985 was
still somewhat below the levels attained in the early 1970s, it should be
noted that the M2 figures exclude holdings of Government bonds outside the
banking sector as well as foreign currency deposits by residents, which had
grown rapidly and reached nearly $2 billion bu the end of 1985, representing
approximately 2.8 percent of GDP.  If these other financial assets are
included, the ratio of broad M2 to GDP is probably about 26-27 percent at
present. This is still rather low for a country at Turkey's stage of economic
development, although it represents a considerable increase over the level of
1980.
Composition of Money SupplY
31.      Large differentials in the yields offered on the various types of
financial instruments have caused significant changes in the composition of
Mz during the last few years (Table 4). Interest bearing time and savings
deposits increased rapidly from 2.6 percent of GDP in 1980 to 6.7 percent in
1981 and 13.0 percent in 1984. However, some of the increase in the volume of
time and saving deposits resulted from a shift within the money supply from
non-interest or low-interest bearing instruments (i.e. currency and demand



- 12 -
deposits) to interest bearing time and savings deposits. Thus Ml (currency
and sight deposits) fell as a percentage of GDP from 17.3 percent in 1979 to
9.9 percent in 1984.  In aggregate, the share of sight, time and savings
deposits in the money supply increased from nearly 72 percent in 1979 to
85 percent in 1985.

Currency               28.3     26.0      35.3    18.1    15.9   16.7    15.0

Time and Savings       15.1     17.1      20.1    49.6    47.3   56.9    63.6

32.      The dramatic change between 1980 and 1985 in the relative shares of
the different kinds of deposits can be linked directly to changes in the
comparative yields of these financial instruments. Since 1981, time and
savings deposits have been yielding nominal interest rates of approximately
50 percent p.a. The rapid fall in the share of currency within the money
supply reflects the high opportunity cost of holding zero-yielding cash
balances. Holdings of sight deposits, which until recently carried an
interest rate of 5 percent (para. 49), have declined in relative terms for the
same reason.
33.      These major changes in the composition of financial assets have had
important consequences, most notably a rapid increase in the average cost of
bank deposits. The increasing share of time deposits carrying higher interest
rates has pushed up the average interest cost of bank deposits from about
30 percent in 1982 to about 40 percent in 1985. As a result, many branches in
rural areas which were able to operate profitably because cheap sight deposits
offset their high administrative costs became unprofitable when the average
interest cost of deposits increased drastically.  In response to these
developments, commercial banks have begun to close down their least profitable
branches. The rising interest cost of bank deposits has caused a significant
increase in the lending rate of banks. Similarly, the opportunity cost to the
banks of the compulsory liquidity and reserve requirements imposed by the
Central Bank has risen in step with the cost of mobilizing deposits. In order
to mitigate the impact of these requirements on the lending rates of
commercial banks, the Central Bank has gradually reduced the level of reserve
requirements (Dara. 56).



- 13 -
34.      The second development in the past few years has been a rapid
shortening of the average maturity of all types of bank deposits, from
8.8 months in 1979 to 3.4 months by the end of 1984. Excluding demand
deposits, the average maturity of time deposits has declined from 32.6 months
in 1979 to 6.1 months in 1984. This development resulted from the combination
of high and volatile inflation since 1980 with the system of fixed deposit
interest rates. In a context of uncertainty as to the course of inflation,
depositors have become extremely reluctant to commit their funds for more than
short periods of time.  In addition, the effective yield set by the Government
on 12 month deposits has been consistently less than on 3 or 6 month deposits,
reflecting the expectation that inflation will decline. The increasingly
short maturity of bank deposits has placed a serious constraint on the ability
of banks to lend Turkish lira funds on a long-term basis.
35.      Another consequence of the change in the composition of monetary
assets in Turkey has been a change in the manner the Government has financed
the budget deficit. As demand declined for currency holdings (which earn no
interest), the ability of the Central Bank to expand its advances to the
Treasury without fuelling inflation declined as well. This consideration led
the Government to increase its reliance onI bond issues as a means of financing
the budget deficit. As of December 1985, the volume of Government bonds
outstanding stood at TL1,526 billion.
Role of the Central Bank in the Financial System
36.      The changing composition of financial assets in Turkey has caused
structural changes in the role of the Central Bank relative to commercial
banks within the financial system. In response to the decline in the ratio of
currency to GDP and the reduction in compulsory reserve requirements, the
Central Bank has cut the volume of its credit to public sector enterprises and
reduced its rediscounting of credits advanced by commercial banks.
Outstanding Central Bank rediscounts to banks were cut in half in nominal
terms between 1983 and 1984. As a result, the net flow of resources from the
Central Bank to commercial banks has become negative as repayments of Central
Bank advances have exceeded the level of new rediscounts.
The Commercial Banks
37.      The impact of the reform of the Turkish financial system has been
particularly strong on the commercial banks. Entry of new banks, including
foreign banks, has increased competition and helped to improve the efficiency
of intermediation as well as profitability. At the end of 1985, there were
50 comuercial banks operating in Turkey.  The 12 public sector banks accounted
for 52 percent of totai assets as against 44 percent for the 19 private banks
and 4 percent for the group of 19 foreign banks. The foreign banks have thus
far concentrated their efforts on a relatively small number of the better
managed firms operating in Turkey, and have tended to specialize in export
trade financing. A deposit insurance scheme covering funds held in commercial
banks was introduced in 1983. The scheme presently provides coverage of
principal amounts up to TL3 million. The Government intends to review the
scope of deposit insurance periodically and raise the ceiling as necesssary to
maintain the level of coverage in real terms.



- 14 -
38.      Interlocking ownership between commercial banks and major industrial
conglomerates has been commonly recognized as a factor inhibiting competition
among banks in providing services to the corporate sector in Turkey. However,
the increasing export orientation of large industrial groups is giving them
access to competitive sources of credit from foreign and, increasingly,
domestic banks specializing in trade financing. The availability of such
alternative financing has mitigated the problems of credit allocation caused
by interlocking ownership. But the reluctance of banks to stop extending
credit to associated corporations that are no longer creditworthy, or to
enforce repayment of existing loans, remains a serious concern. The new
Banking Law (para. 61) has introduced certain restrictions on the operations
of banks to deal with this and other problems. The restrictions include a
20:1 debt/equity ratio limit, a limit to the maximum exposure to any single
customer of 10 percent of a bank's net worth, and limits on a bank's exposure
to officials of the bank and their relatives, or to companies in which the
bank has an equity investment.
39.      The Banking Law also contains more stringent capitalization
requirements aimed at improving the soundness of the banks and their ability
to weather abnormal loan losses. The debt/equity ratio of banks has improved
substantially in the last few years, from about 39:1 in 1980 to 15:1 in 1984.
Although paid-in capital and reserves increased from 2.5 percent of total
assets in 1980 to 6 percent in 1984, the ratio is still very low by
international standards. Overdues are officially estimated at 2.8 percent of
assets but are probably higher given the inconsistency of classification
criteria among the various institutions. It seems, however, that the
portfolio quality of banks has improved somewhat in recent years and that
banks are increasingly able and willing to set aside provisions for bad
debts. Provisions have been raised from 0.3 percent of assets in the late
1970s to an average of 0.6 percent in the period 1981-84. At the same time,
the profitability of banks increased significantly, from 1.2 percent of assets
in 1983 to 2.3 percent in 1984, although performance has been uneven at the
individual bank level. Major banks with a national network of branches have
tended to perform less well than some of the small but fast-growing urban
banks, primarily because of the rising costs of branch banking as depositors
have shifted from low yielding sight deposits to higher yielding time
deposits. Some of the major banks are now responding to these developments by
closing down unprofitable branches, a desirable development in view of the
overbranching which characterizes the Turkish banking system. The closing by
commercial banks of their most inefficienit branches, computerization of
operations and expansion of services are a few of the ways open to the banks
to reduce their administrative costs which remain high in comparison with
banks in other countries. The increasing cost of branch banking has also
favored the emergence of smaller, urban based commercial banks which
concentrate their activities on providing services to the corporate sector.
The Securities Markets
40.      The relative underdevelopment of the securities (particularly
equities) markets as d channel for the direct financing of corporations and as
an element of competition to the commercial banks is an important structural



- 15 -
weakness of the financial sector in Turkey. Securities market operations took
place in a virtual regulatory and supervisory vacuum until 1982. In that
year, the collapse of a large number of brokers prompted the enactment of a
Capital Market Law which gave to a new agency, the Capital Market Board (CMB),
the responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the primary and
secondary markets, including inter alia the approval of public offerings of
corporate securities. In response to the actions taken by the CMB, public
offerings of equities have risen in the last three years and amounted to
TL76 billion in 1985. The corporate bond market, after fast growth in the
late 1970s, lost ground after 1982, but is again showing signs of revival,
with new corporate bond issues in 1985 totalling TL32 billion. The growth of
the securities markets in Turkey has been hampered not only by high inflation
but also by the inadequacy of accounting and auditing sLandards and the
absence of disclosure requirements, which puts a severe limitation on the
ability of financial institutions and investors to evaluate corporate
financial statements.
Growth of Credit
41.      Total credit extended by the financial sector, consisting of credit
extended by the Central Bank, commercial or deposit money banks (DMBs) and
investment and development banks, has grown from TL796 billion in 1979 to
TL5,851 billion in September 1985, excluding holdings of Government bonds by
commercial banks. This increase in nominal terms is however a decline in real
terms from TL796 billion in 1979 to TL606 billion in September 19E5 (in 1979
prices), a decline at a compounded annual rate of 4.6 percent. The sharpest
decline has been in direct credit extended by the Central Bank to the
Government, as the Government has resorted increasingly to financing the
budget deficit by the issue of bonds which are purchased mostly by commercial
banks, rather than by borrowing from the Central Bank. Holdings of Government
bonds by commercial banks increased from TL32.3 billion in 1979 to
TL1,080 billion in 1985.
Impact of Government Borrowings
42.      The rising volumes of Government bond issues which have been
purchased by commercial banks have been partially substituting for credits to
the private sector. The share of the private sector in total domestic credit
extended by the financial sector declined for the first time in 1984 following
a steady increase since 1980 (Table 5). It is also noteworthy that the share
of public sector enterprises in total domestic credit has declined rapidly
since 1982 while the share of Government has increased significantly during
the same period, the latter primarily as a result of the Government's reliance
on the issue of bonds to finance the budget deficit (para. 35). While this
has introduced a measure of budgetary discipline, it has also inevitably
resulted in some crowding out of the private sector from the domestic credit
markets. The situation is likely to change only gradually, as the
inflationary situation improves and the budget is balanced.

PART III - THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
The Macro-Economic Setting
43.      Turkey's structural adjustment program has brought about major
reforms in the macro-economic environment, particularly in exchange rates, the
trade regime, the incentives framework, rationalization of public investment,
the taxation system, pricing policies, the state enterprise sector, and the
planning framework. Most of the reforms have been aimed at accomplishing two
central medium-term objectives -- subjecting Turkey's economy to market forces
and achieving an outward orientation. The macro-policy framework put in place
since 1980 mainly affects the real sectors of the economy, principally
agriculture, industry and energy, but it also affects in a major way how the
financial sector operates. Starting with the Bank's Financial Sector Report,
and continued under the Fourth and Fifth Structural Adjustment Loans, emphasis
began to be placed on financial sector reform. Some important reforms were
launched -- mainly in the structure and level of deposit interest rates,
reductions in the financial transactions tax and the withholding tax on
interest earnings, rationalization of preferential lending rates, and setting
up of an auctioning system for Treasury Bills.
44.      Efficient functioning of the financial sector is very closely linked
with the macro-economic policies followed by the Government as part of its
strategy for the next phase of its adjustment program. The challenge is
essentially to achieve an appropriate balance between stabilization and
growth. The Government has undertaken to pursue monetary, fiscal and trade
policies aimed at curbing the budget deficit, controlling inflation and
maintaining export growth through the revival of private investment. An
efficient financial sector will greatly strengthen the Government's program in
these three areas. In particular, a smoothly functioning financial sector is
a crucial requirement for the healthy expansion of the private sector. At the



- 1.7 -
same time, financial sector reform can only be carried forward effectively
within a framework of sound fiscal and monetary policies. The Government's
macro-economic program emphasizes stabilization with controlled output
expansion to reduce unemployment and improve the average standard of living.
Striking the right balance is crucial to maintaining Turkey's
creditworthiness. Progress towards achieving these objectives will be
monitored in the context of the Bank's ongoing dialogue on economic policies
with the Government.
Financial Sector Reform
45.      The overall objective of the Government's financial sector reform
effort is to deepen the financial system and to establish, over the medium
term, an efficient and flexible system of resource mobilization which would
respond rapidly to market forces and offer a wide variety of instruments to
both borrowers and savers. Such a system would make resources available to
borrowers at positive but reasonable real interest rates and would continue to
grow both in real terms and in relation to GDP. It is clear that the
achievement of these objectives would require coordinated action on a wide
front.
46.      The issues to be addressed in the financial sector relate essentially
to improved resource mobilization and allocation, and call for measures
covering financial policies, instruments and institutions. Financial policies
have strong linkages to fiscal and monetary policy, interest rates and
selective credit policies. Development of instruments includes measures to
integrate the growth of Treasury bonds, commercial paper, and corporate bonds
and equities. Institutional development includes strengthening of the banking
system and expanding the role of the Central Bank in bank supervision,
strengthening the accounting system, developing the capital market, and
developing new institutions and services.
Medium-Term Framework
47.      These actions are wide-ranging and ambitious, and can only be
completed over the medium term. The Government has committed itself to
implement the reform program within a medium-term framework described in its
Statement of Financial Sector Policies-1986, which is annexed to this report
(Annex IV). The expected results of the medium-term reform program can only
be delineated in indicative terms because as the financial system becomes more
market responsive, targets set exogenously will become less useful. However,
as the process of financial sector reform evolves, Turkey's financial system
can be expected over the medium term to exhibit characteristics similar to
those of more developed financial systems of other medium-income countries,
namely: (a) financial depth, mezsured by the percentage of M2 to GDP,
increasing from the present 20-25 percent to 30-35 percent; (b) the
intermediation margins of commercial banks declining to about 3-5 percent of
assets from the present 7-10 percent; (c) the share of long-term instruments
in financing of investments increasing to about 7-10 percent from the present
3-4 percent; and (d) issues of corporate bonds increasing by about 50 percent,
equity issues by about 15 percent and the volume of trading in the inter-bank
market by about 30 percent, all in real terms.



- 18 -
The Program for Reform
48.      The proposed loan would support a program of reforms in the financial
sector that would be compatible with the medium-term framework and would
complement the ongoing macroeconomic adjustment program. The reform actions
would address a range of issues central to the financial sector, including
interest rates, selective credit policies, development of the accounting
profession, audit and supervision of commercial banks, development of capital
markets, and audit of corporations with publicly-issued securities. In
parallel, technical assistance would be provided to upgrade the institutional
capacities and skills of the Treasury, the Central Bank, the Capital Markets
Board, the commercial banks and supervisory agencies. Finally, the loan would
support actions to introduce new financial services such as medium-term export
credit and export credit insurance. The various components are elaborated
below.
A. Sector Policies
Interest Rates
49.      Deposit Rates.  Since 1981, deposit rates have been maintained at
positive real levels, except for sight deposits which still yield only
5 percent per annum. The Government's ultimate objective is to liberalize all
deposit rates fully, once the financial system has improved its robustness and
competitive efficiency. At the present time, however, the effective cost of
deposit resources is largely determined by Government decisions on maximum
permissible deposits yields 1/ and other regulatory requirements such as
compulsory reserve and liquidity requirements. The yield structure on bank
deposits has been kept largely unchanged since August 1985. Comparison with
the December 1984-December 1985 rate of inflation (measured by the change in
the Wholesale Price Index) of 38 percent shows that current after-tax yields
are significantly negative in real terms on sight deposits but generally
positive for time deposits, with the highest real yields of approximately
12 percent being paid for 6-month maturities 2/. In establishing deposit
interest rates, the Government takes into account expectations of domestic
inflation as well as the yields available on foreign currency deposits of
comparable maturity.
1/    Banks have been authorized to determine yields freely on foreign
currency deposits by Turkish residents.
2/    With effect from March 1, 1986, the nominal interest rate ceilings on
3-month and 6-month deposits were reduced by 1 and 2 percentage points
respectively. More recently, from May 1, 1986, the rates on 3, 6 and
12-month deposits have all been reduced by 2-3 percentage points. In
addition, the interest on sight deposits has been raised to about
12 percent (one-third of the rate on 1-month deposits), with a further
rise to two-thirds of the rate to take effect on August 1, 1986. These
changes have been designed to establish a more appropriate yield
structure. The current nominal interest rates are 42 percent,
45 percent and 52 percent for 3, 6 and 12-month deposits respectively.



- 19 -
50.      Lending Rates.  Since the deregulation of lending rates on
non-preferential credits in 1983, the lending rates charged by commercial
banks on short-term credit have exceeded 50 percent p.a. in nominal terms and
currently range between 53 and 64 percent. A nominal rate of 60 percent
represents an effective rate of about 75 percent after quarterly compounding
of interest payments. In addition, borrowers are required to pay a bank
commission of 2 percentage points, a contribution to the Resource Utilization
Support Fund 1/ of 10 percent of the base rate and a financial transactions
tax of 3 percent of the base rate. However, the high real rate of over
40 percent p.a. charged on short-term credit does not represent the average
cost of borrowed funds in the corporate sector. The average cost has indeed
been rising in the past few years, but this is mitigated by some lower rate
preferential credits and short-term foreign currency borrowings from domestic
banks. Nevertheless, the very high cost of Turkish lira borrowings has
reduced the demand for domestic credit.
Selective Credit Policies
51.      Central Bank Rediscount Facility.  Turkey, in common with many
developing countries, maintains a formal system of selective credits to
encourage the development of high-priority sectors, although there are now no
mandatory controls instructing banks to lend any specified proportion of their
deposits to priority sectors. Rather, the Government has relied on the
Central Bank's rediscount facility to support the selective credit system and
to influence lending, especially medium-term lending for investment 2/. The
Government intends to achieve positive interest rates for all preferential
credit to the productive sectors, namely agriculture, industry, mining, trade,
transport and tourism, before the end of 1986.
52.      Central Bank rediscount rates currently range from 28 percent for
small scale industries and agriculture to 52 percent, the "general rate". The
list of rediscount rates has undergone substantial rationalization in the past
two years and essentially includes only five categories now as compared to
more than 30 categories three years ago. The actual cost to the borrowers is
higher than the rediscount rate. The lending bank's commission (1 to
2 percentage points), the contributions to the RUSF and, in some cases, the
3 percent financial transactions tax are added to the rediscount rate. These
"add-ons" result in a final cost of a rediscounted loan which ranges between
30 percent for agricultural credit and about 60 percent for general credit
(Table 6). The sector receiving the largest volume of preferential credit is
the housing sector. Lending rates of the Mass Housing Fund, which is the
major source of housing credit, are not negative except for loans for small
1/    The Resource Utilization Support Fund (RUSF) was introduced in
December 1984 as a scheme to finance capital grants to investors as an
incentive for investment. Grants ranging from 7 to 20 percent of the
capital costs of a project are paid, depending upon the location of the
investment. The RUSF replaced the Interest Rate Rebate Fund (IRRF)
which was a cross-subsidization scheme used to lower the interest cost
on certain types of credit.
2/    For housing credit, a similar role is performed by the Mass Housing
Fund.

units of 60-80 sq.meters (which carry a rate of 15-25 percent). Housing loans
generally carry a maturity of 15 years. The Government is reluctant to raise
housing interest rates at present because it regards the provision of mass
housing at affordable cost as an important part of its effort to alleviate the
social costs of its economic adjustment program. As part of the Bank's
economic and sector work program, a study has been undertaken of housing
finance, which is expected to be forwarded to the Government shortly. The
report highlights the need to integrate changes in housing credit policy with
other aspects of housing policy, consistent with the overall objective of
developing an efficient financial sector.  It must be noted also that for
preferential credit, the Central Bank only rediscounts a part of the loan
amount, typically between 50 and 70 percent. The lending institution
(commercial or development bank) is free to charge its own interest rate
(typically around 65 percent) on the non-rediscounted part of the loan, except
in the case of loans for agriculture. Thus the blended cost of a loan package
can vary between 37 and 63 percent, depending upon the terms of the lending
bank.

53.      Due to the need to meet the limits on growth of net domestic assets
of the Central Bank stipulated in the Government's monetary program, the
Central Bank's rediscount window has had to be closed at various times. thus
reducing the stoeL of rediscounted credit outstanding gradually. Substantial
decreases in the flow of such credit over several quarters of 1984 and 1985
has now resulted in a significant decline in the proportion of the stock of
rediscounted credit in total credit, from around 14.5 percent in 1982 to
5.2 percent in September 1985.
54.      Subsidy on Preferential Credit.  An estimate of the flow of
preferential credit, defined as credit carrying interest rates below the
prevailing inflation rate, can be used to throw light on the level of subsidy
(financial and economic) in the system, and the trend in the volume of such
credit can indicate the movement of the financial system towards market
orientation. Using the change in the Wholesale Price Index over a 12-month
period as the measure of inflation, and taking the final cost to the borrower
(not the rediscount rate) as the interest rate for comparison purposes, the
proportion of preferential credit outstanding to the productive sectors of the
economy (i.e. agriculture, industry, mining, tourism and trade) is estimated
to have declined from 41.6 percent to 13.5 percent over the last two years.
This represents a very substantial shift to a less subsidized and therefore
more market-determined credit system.
55.      Cost of Non-Preferential Credit.  Several factors are responsible for
the high level of non-preferential lending rates prevailing at present
(para. 49). The most important of these is the high cost of deposit
resources, resulting from the policy of providing real positive depocit
interest rates in an environment of high inflation. To this has to be added
the cost of meeting the liquidity and reserve requirements imposed on the
commercial banks by the Central Bank, which raises the effective cost of the
net loanable resources of the banks significantly above the cost of deposits,
to the extent of 7-10 percentage points. The earnings on the banks' liquidity
deposits with the Central Bank (the reserve deposits now earn no interest)
offset only a part of the additional cost. Finally, the banks' intermediation
costs, and applicable taxes and surcharges, add about 6 percentage points and
4 percentage points respectively to the cost of non-preferential credit passed
an to borrowers.
56.      The Government is aware of the cost pressures which are pushing up
non-preferential lending rates. The high base cost of deposit resources is
expected to decline gradually as inflation is brought under control and
deposit rates are lowered. In regard to the other contributing factors, as a
part of the program supported by the loan, the Government intends to:
(i)    reduce the reserve requirements imposed on commercial banks,
from the level of 20 percent that prevailed in late 1985 to
15 percent by September 1986;
(ii)    support the improvement of efficiency of banks to reduce their
intermediation costs further (they are already estimated to have
fallen from over 10 percent in 1983 to 6 percent in 1986); and
(iii)    reduce the financial transaction tax from its present level of
3 percent to 1 percent.



- 22 -
57.      Foret8n Exchang  Risk.  Until mid-1984, the interest rate on foreign
currency loans was set by the Intermediary's cost (or the weighted average
cost) of foreign currency borrowings plus a spread (about 5 percent), with the
borrower assuming the full foreign exchange risk. The substantial
depreciation of the Turkish lira in 1982-84 caused heavy losses to borrowers
carrying the foreign exchange risk and therefore demand for such loans
virtually ceased. To encourage greater use of foreign borrowings, the
Government, in July 1984, instituted a foreign exchange risk insurance scheme
(FERIS). which was made applicable to IBRD loans to two development banks
(TSKB and SYKB). Under this scheme, loans were denominated in TL at a fixed
interest rate (26 percent) over an 8-year term, with a special fund bearing
the foreign exchange risk.  The scheme succeeded in stLimulating investment
demand, in part because the eEfective cost to borrowers was low compared to
the prevailing inflation rate.  The Government decided to continue the scheme
in 1985, witlh a fixed interest rate for sub-loans which would be reviewed
every six months and adjusted as necessary.  The rate is currently 35 percent
for sub-loans of eight years final maturity. The scheme aLso lays down
guidelines for the treatment of prepayment. Coverage of intermediary banks
under FERIS has been extended to include some additional development banks.
The Government's intention is to operate FERIS as a temporary, self-financing
and non-discriminatory scheme to mobilize private sector investment.  In
particular, the Government intends to discontinue FERIS in its present form as
soon as the private investment climate has revived, and to manage the scheme
on a self-financing basis, i.e. without any subsidy from the budget. The
Government has agreed to review before the end of 1986 the need for
continuation of FERIS, taking into account the prevailing rate of inflation,
the cost of financing from other sources and the level of private investment.
The possibility of introducing a floating rate option for sub-loans to reduce
the interest rate risk inherent in a fixed rate long-term loan scheme will
continue to be explored.
58.      Reference Rate for Preferential Credit.  While there has been
significant progress in adjusting rediscount rates and reducing the level of
preferential credit to the productive sectors of the economy, the practice
followed by the Government of adjusting rediscount rates on an ad hoc basis
results in adjustments lagging behind changes in the inflation rate, resulting
in fluctuating real rates. An appropriately formulated reference rate could
be helpful in providing a basis for adjustments to selective credit rates.
Under such a system, the structure of selective credit rates would be adjusted
regularly on the basis of market signals, thereby making the system more
transparent. The Government intends to develop a reference rate to help
monitor and adjust preferential credit interest rates, although it has
stressed the need to preserve some flexibility in managing the monetary
program under conditions of fluctuating inflation.
B. Strengthening the Banking System
Role of the Central Bank
59.      The Government's intention is that the Central Bank should
increasingly concentrate on the formulation and implementation of monetary
policy, and on the supervision of the banking sector.  In line with this
objective, the Government intends to reduce the Central Bank's intervention in
credit allocation through the array of selective credit schemes used very
extensively in the past.  Satisfactory fulfillment of the role envisaged for



- 23 -
the Central Bank requires a clear program regarding the goals of monetary
policy, as well as the use of appropriate monetary instruments to implement
this policy. The classical instruments are the setting and enforcement of
liquidity and reserve requirements, the influencing of the overall direction
of interest rates through such means as the discount rate and the inter-bank
deposit rate, and controlling money sutpply through open market operations.
60.      The economic stabilization program in Turkey calls for a tight
monetary policy to combat inflation, combined with consistent, steady growth
rates in money supply to restore economic growth on a stable path. During the
last twelve months in particular, the Central Bank has moved energetically to
gain effective control over monetary developments. Reserve requirements for
commercial banks are now being monitored at shorter intervals (weekly instead
of monthly as was the practice previously). As part of the tightening of
monetary policy, interest payments on reserve deposits maintained by
commercial banks with the Central Bank have been eliminated from
January 1, 1986. During 1986 the Central Bank intends to monitor more closely
the growth of reserve money, the movement of the money multiplier, as well as
the broader monetary aggregates (M2 and MzX, the latter including foreign
exchange deposits). It also plans in the near future to start open market
operations. Finally, the Central Bank plans to start acting as an
intermediary in the interbank market, which would provide it with another
instrument for influencing liquidity in the banking system.
Supervision of Banks
61.      Historically, the Central Bank has played only a minor role in the
supervision of banks. Its primary responsibilities included monitoring
liquidity and reserve requirements and gathering information from the banks
through its modest reporting mechanisms. When concerns were identified, the
Board of Sworn Bank Examiners and the Banking Directorate witnin the
Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade were notified so that they
might undertake appropriate action. In keeping with the Government's
intention of redefining the Central Bank's responsibilities. the Banking Law
of April 25, 1985 envisages a greater role for the Central Bank in the
supervision of banks. As part of the changes enacted by this law, banks are
required to maintain their accounts, annual balance sheets, and profit and
loss statements according to a standardized system from January 1, 1986. The
Uniform Chart of Accounts, as it is known, has for the first time established
a body of definitions and rules for the classification of accounts and thus
provided a reasonable basis for the presentation and comparison of financial
results.
62.      A critical adjunct to the Uniform Chart of Accounts is the Decree on
Non-Performing Assets dated December 11, 1985. Under the previous system,
non-performing assets, other than those in litigation 1/, were determined
subjectively by banks without regard to delinquency status or other criteria.
Further, banks could continue to accrue interest on such assets. Provisions
1/    The Government has separately amended the Law of Procedure and the
Execution and Bankruptcy Law to improve procedures for the collection of
debts through legal action, but problems arising from the major increase
in the number of cases before the courts and the inadequate staffing of
the courts and court offices are likely to persist.



- 24 -
for losses were made on the basis of the bank's profitability, and bad debts
were written off at the sole discretion of management. With the passage of
the Decree, non-performing status for loans other than current accounts (i.e.
overdraft limits) is to be determined on the basis of delinquency. Upon
reaching non-performing status, the accrual of interest must be discontinued
and mandatory minimum provisions are to be made, thus establishing a linkage
between portfolio quality and the reserve for loan losses. For current
accounts, the principal form of commercial bank credit in Turkey, the Decree
on Non-Performing Assets is less specific concerning the criteria triggering
default, so that a declaration of default continues to remain at the
discretion of management. However, the Government is considering actions to
correct this situation and to lay down guidelines for current account
lending.
63.      Closely linked to the Uniform Chart of Accounts is the requirement
contained in the Banking Law that annual balance sheets and profit and loss
statements of commercial banks be certified by external auditors. Because of
the absence of an established accounting profession in Turkey, the Central
Bank has undertaken the task of initially defining the criteria for eligible
auditors. These criteria are expected to include certain minimum
qualifications related to education, work experience, and professional
reputation. The audits of banks' financial statements are to commence from
the fiscal year 1987. To improve the quality of financial reporting by banks,
the Central Bank will require the submission of nearly 50 periodic reports,
most of them quarterly, for the purpose of supervising each bank's
activities. These reports will provide a substantive base of detailed
information for analysis, and will be used to generate a standard package of
analytical information for each bank covering four primary areas: capital
adequacy, asset quality, profitability and efficiency and liquidity.
Transactions involving related entities, insiders, large borrowers and large
depositors will also be monitored.
64.      The performance of offsite surveillance and early warning analysis is
a critical part of the Central Bank's emerging role in the system of bank
supervision in Turkey. In support of these efforts, the Central Bank is
committing additional resources for bank supervision under a newly created
Division of Bank Surveillance. The division is to be staffed with
approximately ten analysts at inception, but the number is expected to
increase as the Central Bank's role in the supervisory process strengthens.
The Central Bank has sought technical assistance in the area of bank
supervision, and also to upgrade its internal training effort. A technical
assistance program with a total foreign exchange cost of $484,000 has been
formulated for this purpose, to be funded from the proceeds of the proposed
loan.
The Board of Sworn Bank Examiners
65.      The Board of Sworn Bank Examiners was established in 1958 and is the
principal onsite supervisory body charged with implementing the provisions of
the Banking Law and other laws concerning banks and control of banking
operations. Examinations are undertaken once during a two-year period
although problem banks and branches are examined more often. The examination
process as it now exists is designed primarily to determine compliance with
the law and to report on the financial condition of the bank at a point in
time. As part of the effort to encourage bank managements to adopt modern
management practices, including the systems, policies, procedures and controls
necessary for efficient operation in a dynamic environment, the Board of Sworn



- 25 -
Bank Examiners intends to revise the current examination manual with the
assistance of consultants financed under the proposed loan.  In parallel, a
technical aisistance program will be carried out in cooperation with the
Office of The Comptroller of the Currency in the United States for the
training of bank examiners, and essential office equipment including computers
and related software will be acquired. The foreign exchange cost of the
program, estimated to be $255,000, is proposed to be funded out of the loan.
The Proposed Banking Institute
66.      The desired improvements in the commercial banking system necessitate
the introduction of modern banking methods and technology, upgrading and
internationalizing the skills of the existing personnel, and recruitment and
training of new talent. For this purpose, the Central Bank has taken a
decision in collaboration with the Turkish Banks Association to set up a
banking institute or training school which would servc the needs of the entire
banking industry. The proposed banking institute will be modelled after the
Citibank Training Center in Athens and will be a residential school with its
own facilities. Citibank will manage the school during the first five years
under a management contract on a not-for-profit basis, with its costs fully
reimbursed by the Turkish Banks Association, which will be the owner. The
initial capital expenditures for buildings and grounds will be provided by the
Turkish Banks Association, while the recurrent coots will be met from tuition
fees from the training programs and seminar participation fees. Resolutions
to this effect have already been approved by the Association, and core
training programs to be offered at the institute have been identified with the
help of consultants. Under the proposed loan, an amount of $882,000 will be
provided to finance the foreign exchange component of the capital cost of
setting up the institute. Tho amount would cover the cost of teaching
equipment including personal computers and audio visual equipment, copying and
printing equipment, and computer software, which wiil remain the property of
the Government. The establishment of a training school for banking personnel
would be a condition of disbursement of funds earmarked .or this component.
C. Developing the Money and Capital Markets
Background
67.      Money and capital markets have traditionally been a weak link in the
Turkish financial sector. Their growth has been hampered by an inadequate
institutional and regulatory environment and more recently, by high
inflation. Under these circumstances, the markets have been characterized by
low activity levels, segmentation, high intermediation costs and occasional
speculative bursts. Recently, however, there has been increasing appreciation
of the potential benefits of well-organized financial markets. Consequently,
their development has been accorded high priority by the Government.
68.      A large but completely unregulated market for a variety of private
paper had emerged in Turkey in the late 1970s as a result of the rigid deposit
interest rate structure which produced highly negative real rates in a period
of high inflation. As savings consequently moved out of bank deposits,
smaller banks experiencing liquidity problems devised ways to circumvent
deposit rate ceilings by selling CDs through brokers at discounts. These
brokers would resell the CDs to the public at par, adding to the interest by
issuing parallel promissory notes in their own names. The difference between
the brokers' buying and selling prices (the discount) was lent, usually at



- 26 -
very high interest rates, to marginal businesses desperate for cash. The
brokers thus acted as bankers, borrowing and lending money in their own names,
but without being subject to reserve or liquidity requirements or controls.
Initially this line of business proved highly profitable and a large number of
brokerage houses sprang up, raising the volume of CDs to 10 percent of bank
deposits in 1981, but the system collapsed in 1981-82 as brokers could not
collect the loans they had made, and in the absence of a lender of last
resort, could not honor their repurchase guarantees. These events have
profoundly affected the attitudes of the authorities towards the money markets
and have influenced the regulatory framework set up in response to the
crisis.
Interbank Market
69.      The drying up of CDs in the wake of the collapse left smaller
commercial banks with no alternative but to borrow from the larger banks.
This gave considerable impetus to the interbank market, which hardly existed
until the late 1970s. However, annual turnover in the interbank market still
remains low at under $2.0 billion equivalent. The market is also rather
fragmented, transaction costs are as high as 4-5 percent and yields vary
greatly even for deposits of comparable risk and maturity. The most active
participants in the interbank market are the foreign banks operatir.g in
Turkey, but there is a general unidirectional flow from the larger banka with
extensive branch networks to smaller banks in need of funds.
70.      The Government is implementing a number of actions to develop the
potential of the interbank market fully. These include the reduction of the
financial transactions tax from its present level of 3 percent and the
enforcement of the reserve and liquidity requirements on commercial banks
every week, thereby providing an impetus to the interbank market. The
Government is also reviewing Article 11 of the Corporate Tax Law, which is
being interpreted presently by the tax authorities as subjecting the foreign
banks to a withholding tax of 25 percent of the income from interbank
deposits. Finally, the Central Bank ;s corsidering entering the interbank
market itself, to overcome the traditional reluctance of Turkish banks to deal
directly with each other and as a tool for influencing the amount of liquidity
in the system.
Treasury Securities
71.      After years of reliz-ce on the financing of deficits by recourse to
the Central Bank, the Government began to issue securities priced at
competitive rates in 1984. Initially these securities were sold "on tap"
through the Central Bank. In May 1985, a market pricing mechanism was
introduced through weekly auctions of six-month, one-year and two-year
securities. The volume of Government bonds outstanding has thereafter
increased rapidly, from TL886 billion in December 1984, to TL1,526 billion in
December 1985. The introduction of the regular weekly auctions has
significantly increased the supply of market-priced securities. The
Government is currently considering actions to improve the functioning of the
system and to diversify the maturities offered. The secondary market for
Government securities has grown in volume from TL35 billion in 1984, when
trading of any consequence started, to TL410 billion in 1985. Commercial
banks account for 85 percent of the trading, and ten licensed firms for the
rest. The growing secondary market should offer opportunities for introducing
open market operations by the Central Bank as an effective tool for monetary
policy purposes.



- 27 -
Regulatory Framework
72.      Despite recent improvements, the institutional framework --
particularly the scarcity of reliable corporate financial information -- and
the current inflationary environment are not conducive to the rapid
development of the Turkish capital markets. Pending the strengthening of the
institutional framework and the stabilization of macro-economic conditions, it
is likely that markets for longer-term securities will develop more slowly
than markets for short-term Government and bank instruments.
73.      The Capital Market Board (CMB) has the main responsibility for the
regulation and supervision of the primary and secondary markets for
securities. Its duties include:
(a) Supervision of corporations which have made public offers of
securities or have at least 100 shareholders.
(b) Supervision and regulation of investment companies, mutual funds
and securities market intermediaries, including securities firms
and -- limited to their securities operations -- banks.
(c) Review a.ad approval of all public offerings of corporate
securities and negotiable instruments, with the exception of
bank instruments.
The CMB "approves" public offerings, depending not just on the applicant's
compliance with financial disclosure and other legal requirements, but also on
a judgement of the investment merits of securities.  This approach carries
some potential risks, because it can be perceived as CMB having responsibility
for losses suffered by investors who bought "approved" issues, and by
encouraging investors to rely on the Board's judgement on the merits and
safety of securities, may hamper the development of an independent market
capability to appraise and price securities. Further, from a practical point
of view, a thorough screening of all new issues would require a huge CMB
staff. The fact that the CMB's review is based on unaudited data adds to the
above reasons for concern.
74.      Considering its short existence, the CMB has a creditable record of
success in restoring some order and confidence to the securities markets.
These positive results, h,werer, hav: often been achieved by imposing
restrictions on permissible nstruments and on the operations of
intermediaries which. while justified in the emergency situation in which the
CMB began its activity, might constrain the future development of the market.
The Government intends in the next phase to reduce CMB interventions in such
areas as detailed ;cgulation and specification of permissible securities and
related activities, including minimum and maximum maturities, underwriting
fees, and pricing. The CMB would concentrate in future on enforcing
disclosure and audit requirements for securities issues, with a view to
ultimately enabling investors and intermiiediaries to assess the quality of
securities on the basis of reliable information. It has been agreed that
independent auditing of companies registering for public offerings or seeking
listing in the new Stock Ejxchange will be introduced from 1987, in accordance
with the same time frame as that proposed for the banks. This would be
followed in due course by the introduction of compulsory external audit for
securities intermediaries, other financial institutions and eventually all
major corporations.



- 28 -
75.      The need for training is suistantial in both private and public
sector entities in the capital markets area in Turkey. The CMB has a well
established training program for its entry and mid-level personnel, which is
funded by the OECD and implemented at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania. Under the proposed loan, it is proposed to supplement the OECD
program by funding the acquisition of teaching equipment for a training center
at the CMB, and to provide training fellowships for CMB staff as well as
advisory services of consultants at a foreign exchange cost of $275,000.
Personnel of securities trading firms would also be eligible for training
under the CMB program.
The Primary and Secondary Capital Markets
76.      Primary Markets.  Public offerings of the main types of capital
market instruments in the post three years are shown below:
Table 7: PUBLIC ISSUES OF SECURITIES
(TL billion)
1983              1984               1985
No.    Amt.       No.    Amt.        No.    Amt.
Corporate Equities    130        35       121      64        175      76
Corporate Bor.ds        54       16        26      11         43      32
Govt. Revenue Bonds      -        -          1     10          2     140
In the past three years, public offerings of equities have substantially
exceeded, in real terms, the levels achieved in the late 1970s and early
1980s. The steps taken by the Government to favor the development of the
equity market include: (a) the complete repeal of taxation of dividends and
capital gains; (b) the repeal of taxation of the premium on newly issued
shares over their par value; and (c) the opening of a new Istanbul Stock
Exchange to replace the previously existing but dormant stock exchange. These
measures, particularly when put in the context of other reforms being
undertaken to improve the institutional framework and the quality of financial
information, should contribute to creating an environment more conducive to
the development of equity markets.
77.      The corporate bond market grew very fast in the later 1970s, as a
tool for both borrowers and investors to bypass the high intermediation costs
of the banking system. Bond issues declined after 1980, however, partly
because of the collapse in 1981-82 of many bond dealers and partly because of
increasing competition from time deposits and Government paper, which now
carry more attractive yields than in the past. This trend has been partly
reversed in 1985, due to the relaxation of restrictions on the coupon rates
that could be offered. By CMB regulation, minimum and maximum maturities of
corporate bonds are set at two and seven years, although most recent issues
have had 2-3 year maturities. Issuing prices and coupon yields are set by the
Central Bank according to a formula which determines a minimum and maximum
yield to maturity. This formula had seriously restricted the competitiveness
of bonds in 1983-84 but its relaxation in 1985 has permitted a better



- 29 -
adaptation of bond yields to market conditions. All-in costs to issuers of
bonds have recently averaged 66-68 percent, well below the cost of bank loans,
while net yields to individual investors have been 56-58 percent. It has been
agreed with the Government that the detailed controls exercised by the CMB in
the review and approval of corporate bond issues would now be relaxed,
complemented by the introduction of external audit requirements for
corporations issuing bonds by public issue.
78.      Government revenue sharing instruments, essentially tax free and with
maturities of 3-5 years, were first issued in 1984-85 to finance major
infrastructure projects. This sharing in a project's revenues, rather than
receiving payments of interest, makes them particularly attractive to orthodox
Islamic investors. The CMB is studying the introduction of similar
instruments in the private sector. These instruments would be particularly
useful to meet the funding needs of leasing companies, some of which are being
established in a regulatorv environment which has been improved by the
enactment of a leasing law.
79.      Secondary Markets.  In the past, the lack of efficient secondary
markets and thus of liquidity has limited the potential for developing longer
term financial instruments in Turkey. Trading in corporate equities and bonds
has mostly occurred over-the-counter and in low volumes, with the old Istanbul
Stock Exchange being practically inactive. Furthermore, the market has been
characterized by fragmentation, lack of transparency and high intermediation
costs, with trading spreads as high as 10-20 percent for equities.  In the
bond markets, dealers have mostly confined themselves to making markets in the
securities they have underwritten, trading only with their own clients and not
with other dealers.
Intermediaries and Institutional Investors
80.      Intermediation in the primary and secondary markets for longer term
securities is carried out by ten licensed securities firms and a limited
number of commercial banks. There is some specialization by instruments, with
securities firms dominating corporate bond underwriting and trading, and
commercial banks being more active in public sector securities.  The small
equity market is about evenly split between securities firms and banks.
81.      Securities firms have the advantage of more specialized expertise,
but their contribution to the financial markets is limited.  The CMB has
appropriately encouraged the establishment of independent firms, four of which
have recently been licensed. The next step would be to establish strict
solvency and liquidity ratios, as well as disclosure and reporting standards,
and then to set-up a flexible mechanism to accommodate the daily liquidity
needs of securities firms. Commercial and development banks are allowed a
broader range of capital market activities than securities firms. In
practice, most Turkish banks hoid equity investments in affiliate companies,
but have not been active in turning over these holdings and in promoting
securities markets. Recently, however, more commercial banks have started
securities departments, and a few are now involved in limited underwriting and
trading of corporate equities and bonds, in addition to a relatively large
activity in public sector securities. The Government is considering measures
to encourage banks to progressively divest their relatively large portfolios
of equities of non-financial firms as a means of increasing the supply of
equities in the open market.



- 30 -
82.      The Turkish insurance industry has suffered from years of high
inflation which have undermined the demand for insurance products. Life
insurance in force in 1983 was only about 0.7 percent of GNP in Turkey, as
compared to 7 percent in Thailand, 36 percent in Korea, 156 percent in the USA
and 300 percent in Japan. Total assets of the Turkish insurance industry
amounted to only TL114 billLon in 1983. Of these, securities accounted for
31.6 percent (6.8 percent equities and 24.8 percent bonds, mostly Government
bonds). Furthermore, portfolio management by insurance firms has often been
oriented towards investment in affiliated or otherwise related companies,
which probably accounts for the unsatisfactory overall return on earning
assets. However, the introduction of tax deductibility of insurance premia
has led to substantial increases in the assets managed by insurance companies,
with corresponding increases in securities investments. A new insurance law
under preparation, providing for higher capital requirements for insurance
companies and a more marked separation of their activities from those of other
financial institutions, is also expected to contribute to the development of
the industry.
83.      Social security entities include four public sector and about sixty
(mostly bank-related) private pension funds. Their total assets exceeded
TL900 billion at the end of 1984, with only 14 percent of the assets invested
in securities, mostly low-yield bonds of the State Investment Bank. Equity
holdings of private pension funds are mostly in related companies, and
control-oriented. It has been agrEed with the Government that a review would
be carried out of the investment guidelines of the Social Security System and
pension funds, to orient them increasingly towards long-term corporate bonds
and equities.
D. Developing the Accounting and Audit Professions
84.      The existence of a well developed accounting and audit profession,
applying internationally accepted accounting standards, is a precondition for
the development of a modern financial system. However, there is as yet no
professional organization for accountants in Turkey. The accounting function
in the central and local governments, State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) and
medium and large-scale private industrial and commercial firms is usually
controlled by university graduates from the business, economics and law
faculties.
Accounting
85.      Most SEEs have financial accounting systems designed to produce
financial reports required by Government budgeting regulations. These reports
are intended principally to enable verification of compliance with Government
regulations rather than to provide financial information to analyze the
operations of the enterprise meaningfully. Costing and management accounting
in SEEs is practically nonexistent. In some of the private Turkish holding
companies and large manufacturing companies, modern financial and management
accounting systems have been developed and are operating satisfactorily.
These cases, however, are the exception. In private industry in general,
accounting is limited to control of assets and liabilities and to the
production of annual income statements and balance sheets, mainly to meet the
requirement of the tax laws. The accounting standards used in these accounts
are those required by the tax code and not in accordance with generally



- 31 -
accepted accounting principles. The accounts are usually finalized well after
the end of the fiscal year. Management accounting is generally limited to
ad-hoc costing for pricing purposes.
Auditing
86.      Within the Ministry of Finance, there are three groups of auditors
totalling about 400 in number consisting of Finance Inspectors, Tax Auditors
and Sworn Bank Examiners. Tlie Finance Inspectors are mainly responsible for
auditing the accounts of Government departments; Tax Auditors are responsible
for auditing tax returns; and Sworn Bank Examiners (para. 65) undertake onsite
audit of state, commercial and development banks to ensure compliance with
Government and Central Bank regulations. The High Control Board attached to
the Prime Minister's Office, with a staff of about 180 auditors, is
responsible for auditing SEEs. The public sector auditors, while adequately
trained, are limited in number; the result is that audits are not completed
within a reasonable time-frame and are often, by necessity, cursory, with an
emphasis largely on compliance with Government regulations. Private companies
with a wide shareholder base are required under the Comercial Code to appoint
auditors to inspect their books of accounts, report any irregularity to
management and certify the company's accounts. No professional qualification
is required for persons appointed as auditors. A number of the international
accounting firms have associated firms operating in Turkey. In recent years
there has been an increase in demand for their audit services from Turkish
industrialists and banks which wish to borrow abroad.
Development of the Accounting Profession
87.      The Government of Turkey has made numerous efforts during the past
three decades to enact a law for the control and development of the accounting
profession. Legislation has been submitted to Parliament several times but
has failed to secure approval due to opposition from various groups protecting
their own parochial interests. Eventually in December 1985, an act was passed
setting up the legal framework for a Board of Sworn Financial Advisers. Under
the law, the Government is authorized to appoint a 20-member Board for a
three-year period to be responsible for the development and control of the
accounting profession. The Board is expected to be appointed shortly. The
primary objective of the law is to increase the collection of tax by improving
the standards of accounting. However, the mandate of the Board is broad
enough to enable it to undertake a general development of the accounting and
audit profession. The law sets forth in general terms the scope of work of
SFAs, authorizes the tax authorities to accept tax returns certified by SFAs,
and empowers the Council of Ministers to issue decrees setting forth
regulations for the organization, administration and control of Chambers of
Sworn Financial Advisers.
88.      To enable the Board to develop proposals for the establishment of a
professional organization and for the development of the profession, technical
assistance will be funded under the proposed loan in the following fields:
(i)    design of the organization's charter, by-laws and establishment
of an appropriate administration;



- 32 -
(ii)    assessment of the potential number of accountants required
during the next ten years and appropriate accounting streams;
(iii)    establishment of educational sLandards for admission of student
members, selection of appropriate professional subjects for each
stream of accounting, and establishment of appropriate
curricula;
(iv)    organization of professional examinations and establishment of
practical experience requirements for admission of mature and
student candidates to full membership;
(v)    preparation of generally accepted accounting and auditing
standards for Turkey; and
(vi)    organization of seminars to promote the accounting profession in
Turkey.
In addition, finance would be provided to cover the foreign exchange cost of
the Board's office equipment, travel and subsistence allowances for study
tours and training courses, and the establishment of a library.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED LOAN
89.      The proposed loan originates from the Bank's economic and sector work
in Turkey during the last five years. The role of the financial sector in
Turkey's development, its performance and prospects have been under discussion
between the Bank and the Government since 1983. The loan was appraised in
January 1986. Negotiations were held in Ankara in May 1986, with a Turkish
delegation led by Mr. Kadir Gunay, Director General, Undersecretariat of the
Treasury and Foreign Trade. A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Turkey -
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan" (No. 6095-TU) dated May 15, 1986 is being
distributed separately. A loan summary is provided at the beginning of this
report and Annex III contains supplementary loan data.
90.      The proposed loan would be in support of a multi-year program of
policy and institutional reforms as set out in the Letter of Financial Sector
Policies (Annex IV). The specific objectives of the loan, as discussed in the
preceding sections of this report, are to:
(i)    improve the efficiency of the resource allocation process
through an appropriate interest rate structure and adjustment
mechanisms;
(ii)    reduce the extent of subsidies on selective credits;
(iii)    rationalize the tax treatment of financial instruments;
(iv)    strengthen the capacity of the Central Bank to supervise the
operation of commercial banks;
(v)    support the introduction of standardized accounting and external
audit of banks;



- 33 -
(vi)    encourage measures to reduce the intermediation costs of
commercial banks;
(vii)    strengthen the institutional framework for the development,
supervision and regulation of primary and secondary capital
markets;
(viii)    assist the development and functioning of interbank and money
markets;
(ix)   support the development of the accounting and audit profession;
and
(x)    initiate the introduction of new financial services.
Loan Components
91.      The proposed loan of $300 million, to be made to the Republic of
Turkey, will have two components: a policy reform component and a technical
assistance component. The policy reform component ($297 million) would
support the policy actions in the financial sector set out by the Government
in its Statement of Financial Sector Policies and discussed in Part III of
this report. The technical assistance component of $3 million, as summarized
in Annex V, would support a comprehensive training effort to upgrade skills in
the institutions involved in the implementation of financial sector reforms,
namely the Treasury, the Central Bank, the Board of Sworn Bank Examiners, the
Capital Market Board, the Board of Sworn Financial Advisers and the commercial
banks.
92.      The policy reform component of the proposed loan would finance a
little over 1 percent of Turkey's total merchandise imports over its planned
disbursement period (June 1986-June 1988). This component would cover all
goods to be imported into Turkey except for goods financed by other sources
and a specific list of excluded items such as military or para-military items
and luxury goods such as tobacco, precious stones and jewelry, gold, and
nuclear reactors and parts. The technical assistance component of the loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1989.
Procurement, Disbursement and Administration
93.      The Undersecretariat of the Treasury and Foreign Trade and the
Central Bank would have primary responsibility for administering the proposed
loan. Procurement of goods estimated to cost $10 million or more would be
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. All contracts of lesser value would be awarded
through customary trade channels on the basis of the normal procurement
procedures of the public and private sector firms concerned. Computer
hardware and software would be procured either by obtaining at least three
price quotations from suppliers eligible under the Bank's Guidclines or
through direct negotiations with the original suppliers if compatibility with
existing equipment is to be ensured. Firms in Turkey have adequate choice of
international suppliers to ensure reasonable availability and price.
Consultancy services for the various technical assistance components would be
obtained in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Recruitment of
Consultants, except in the case of the Banking Institute for which a
management contract (which is not being financed by the Bank) with Citibank is



- 34 -
expected to be concluded shortly. In order to ensure a smooth flow of
necessary imports, retroactive financing would be permitted of up to
$30 million of expenditures made after April 15, 1986.
94.      To simplify disbursement, only invoices with a minimum value of
$50,000 equivalent would be eligible for disbursement. The loan would be
disbursed against direct and indirect foreign exchange costs. In order to
ensure that Turkey would have ready access to foreign exchange, a Special
Account would be established in the Central Bank of Turkey to which the World
Bank would make an initial deposit of $45 million. Payment requests would be
made against standard documentation and statements of expenditure. The
Special Account would be replenished against withdrawal applications at
monthly intervals or as appropriate when the undisbursed balance of the
Account falls below $25 million.
E. Monitoring
95.      Monitoring of performance involves essentially two complementary and
inter-related activities. Monitoring of the implementation of the
Government's macro-economic program would continue as part of the Bank's
ongoing economic dialogue and reporting arrangements. In addition, the Bank
would monitor progress on specific agreed reform actions as a condition of
tranche release. The specific conditions proposed for release of the second
tranche of $100 million will include:
(a) actions to ensure adequate progress in implementing the 1986
economic program and adoption of a 1987 economic program,
compatible in terms of its strategy and its targets, with the
Government's adjustment program (para. 44);
GU) achievement of positive real interest rates for preferential
credit to the productive sectors (para. 51);
(c) completion of a review of the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance
Scheme (para. 57);
(d) introduction of external audit requirements for commercial
banks, commencing with fiscal year 1987 (para. 63);
(e) actions to ensure adequate progress in strengthening the
auditing techniques utilized by the Board of Sworn Bank
Examiners, including the revision of its manual (para. 65);
(f)  introduction of external audit requirements, commencing with
fiscal year 1987, for corporations issuing securities by public
issue or applying to list their securities with the Istanbul
Stock Exchange (para. 74);
(g) appointment of the Board of Sworn Financial Advisers and
conclusion of arrangements for technica' assistance for the
Board (paras. 87 and 88);
(h) preparation of an implementation program for the establishment
of a system of export credit and insurance (para. 48).
Disbursements for the technical assistance component would not be subject to
the tranche release conditions.



- 35 -
Benefits and Risks
96.      The principal benefit from the proposed loan would be the improved
functioning of the financial sector, which is a service sector affecting all
productive sectors of the economy through its role in resource mobilization
and allocation. An efficient financial sector enhances growth, both by
increasing savings and by channelling them to more productive investments.
The impact of the proposed loan would therefore extend far beyond the
financial sector itself. The conluct of monetary and fiscal policy would be
strengthened through the enhancement of the Central Bank's role and the
greater efficiencies in the banking sector expected to be attained under the
program supported by the loan. Moreover, improved accounting would help the
banks to plan better their growth of credit and deposit operations, taking
into account their cost and profitability profiles. The loan would also
address the development of the accounting and audit profession, an area which
has received inadequate attention in the past. The development of the
profession and improved accounting systems would in the long run improve the
Government's budgetary control, monitoring of SEE performance and tax
collection. In the private sector, it would facilitate efforts to achieve
productivity improvement and restructuring. Finally, the loan would support
the development of the money and capital markets, a major objective of
financial sector reform.
97.      The main risks are related to the three areas of focus of the
proposed loan. The reforms sought in the policies related to interest rates
and selective credits could be rendered more difficult by failure in attaining
macro-economic policy objectives, the most critical among which is the
reduction of inflation. The persistence of high levels of inflation is a
major constraint to the reduction of the prevailing high real interest rates
and consequent corporate financial distress. The outlook for inflation is
more positive now than at any time in the last two years, but the need for
tight monetary and fiscal policies continues. The recent sharp fall in
international oil prices should help the Government in its efforts to contain
inflation. As regards improvements in the functioning of the banking system,
the progress made in setting up the Central Bank's surveillance department,
the thoroughness of the consultants' study in setting out the procedures, and
the positive response of the banks to the new procedures and mechanisms
suggest that the risk of not attaining program objectives is low. The
increased competition from foreign banks and the impetus to install modern
technology and systems to process information and transactions quickly are
pushing the banks to modernize their systems. The setting up of a legal
framework for the Board of Sworn Financial Advisers has removed a major
impediment to the development of the accounting profession, but it may take a
considerable period of time for the credentials of the new institution to be
established and generally accepted. There remains some uncertainty about the
impact which the development program for the capital market can achieve while
inflation is high and the return which equity holders can obtain is unlikely
to match the interest rates on fixed-term deposits. However, it is
encouraging that there is a strong, though somewhat thin, demand for equities
and the corporate bond market is growing rapidly. Finally, while some
resistance to the introduction of compulsory external audit of corporations is
to be expected, there is a growing awareness of the necessity of properly
audited accounts as Turkish firms enter into joint ventures with foreign
companies.

PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS rN TURKEY
98.     Through March 31, 1986 the Bank and IDA have lent $6740.7 million 1/
to Turkey, through 92 projects. Agriculture accounts for 23 percent of the
funds lent, industry and DFCs for 22 percent, powec for 18 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 25 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged 62 percent of
appraisal estimates at the end of March 1986, which compares favorably with
other countries in the region. As of March 31, 1986, IFC commitments to
Turkey totalled about $254 million, of which about $69 million were still held
by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of March 31, 1986.
99.     Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and asopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was completed ia June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program.  Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current Five Year Plan involves the broadening and deepening
of the adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments
have underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
without giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of
Bank lending in the post-SAL period will continue to be on striking an
appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment lending designed in part to be
quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and
carefully formulated project lending focussing on high priority projects
principally in the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
100.     A series of sectoral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
planned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. The proposed loan for the financial sector is the second of the
series. Further lending of this kind would support measures to enhanc. the
utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private sectors, keeping
in view the scope for the "privatization" of public'ly-held assets in the
manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral adjustment loans are
likely to be developed include energy and transport, and it is expected that
there would be a follow-up loan in agriculture.
101.     Project lending, which would continue to make up the majority  f the
lending operations, would be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. Some project lending would be earmarked for the construction or
rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would be
guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (includiag provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least eeveloped provinces
in Eastern Turkey).

102.     This would be the sixth loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors in this fiscal year.  Other projects being processed include a
second rail%a; project and the Sir hydropower project.
103.     Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1986-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 14 percent in 1984, is estimated at 14.4 percent in 1985, and is
expected to grow to about 20 percent by 1989.  Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to $14.7 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.2 billion in 1984 to $7.5 billion in 1989.  The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 18.6 percent in 1989.
104.     lFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines. piston rings, food processing and tourism.  It has also invested in
the .ndustrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms.  In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
106.     I am satisfied that the proposed lnan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend   at the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan:

Mr. A. W. Clausen

1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C.
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Clausen:
The Turkish Government has now completed the sixth year of the
Government's program for restructuring the economy. The adjustment program
has helped Turkey to ex,nd exports and to improve its external balance.
Under the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan, the Government will continue to
encourage liberalization of the economy, develop industry along lines of
comparative advantage and promote growth of exports. We have also begun to
widen the adjustment process by emphasizing policy and institutional reforms
at the sectoral level.
The Government has given a high priority to reforms in the financial
sector, within a medium-term framework covering the next five years. The
attached Statement of Financial Sector Policies describes the main elements in
the Government's program for financial sector reform relating to sector
policies, the banking system and the development of capital markets. It
encompasses policy and institutional measures either under way or those to be
undertaken in 1986 and 1987. The Government is committed to carry out the
financial sector reform program as described in the attachments. As always,
the Government would welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters with the
World Bank. I am writing to you at this time to request a Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan in the amount of $300 million to assist in the financing of
the Government's program of financial sector reform.
Yours sincerely,
/s/Kaya Erdem
Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of State

Attachment I
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES - 1986
Introduction
1.      The Government recognizes that an important aeterminant of the
success of the economic reform program begun in January 1980 will be the
effectiveness of changes being introduced in the financial system under the
reform program, and especially during the last two years. Efficient
functioning of the financial system is very closely linked with macro-economic
policies Eollowed by the Government to address the major issues in the
readjustment program. The overall objective of the Government is to establish
over the medium term an efficient and flexible system of resource mobilization
and allocation, which would respond rapidly to market forces and would offer a
wide variety of instruments to both savers and borrowers, make resources
available efficiently at positive real rates, and continue to grow in real
terms.
Macro-Economic Perspective
2.       The Government will pursue an economic system in which market forces
operate freely. The main function of the state in economic development should
be regulatory, helping to remove obstacles to the growth of productivity. The
direct activities of the state should be confined to the development of
infrastructure that serves the nation as a whole.
3.       Financial sector reform can only be carried forward within a
framework of sound fiscal and monetary policies. In the context of the
economic reform program, the Goverunent has pursued monetary and fiscal
policies aimed at curbing the budget deficit, controlliag inflation and
maintaining export growth. These policies have produced substantial results,
notwithstanding the setback that occurred in 1983. In 1984, GDP growth was
5.9 percent; it is estimated to have been 4.9 percent in 1985 and is projected
at 5.0 percent in the 1986 Annual Program. Inflation is likely to be lower,
at 38.2 percent in 1985 as compared to 53.5 percent in 1984 (both measured on
a December/December basis), and is projected to decline to 25 percent in 1986;
the budget deficit has been reduced substantially from 4.9 percent of GDP in
1984 to 2.3 percent in 1985. and is targeted to decline to 1.4 percent in
1986. The Government is fully committed to continue these policies.
Scope of Financial Sector Adjustment
4.       The Government proposes to address a wide range of issues in the
financial sector as actions in various areas are closely interlinked. The
principal issues lie in the areas of interest rates and selective credit
policies, the functioning of the commercial banking system, the development of
capital markets, and introduction of new financial services such as export
credit and insurance. The progress that has been achieved in the principal
areas during the last few years, and the steps the Government proposes to
take, are described more fully in the following paragraphs.

ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 10
Interest Rates and Credit Flows
5.       The Government's long-term objactive, in keeping with the objective
of reducing the role of the state in the economy, is to allow market forces to
determine the level and structure of interest rates. However, there are a
number of constraints which make it difficult to move imnediately to full
liberalization of interest rates, including the volatility of international
interest rates, the lack of sufficient depth in the inter-bank money market
and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector. The Government has
already taken an important step toward liberalization of interest rates by
starting a system of weekly auctions of treasury bonds since the middle of
1985, in which the yields are determined freely according to availability of
funds in the banking system. The Government's next objective would be to
encourage the development of a secondary market in Government securities which
would offer opportunities for shorter-term placement of funds.
6.       The Government is committed to maintain, and has maintained, positive
real rates on term deposits since the beginning of 1984. In setting deposit
rates, the Central Bank has also progressively provided higher yields on
longer maturity deposits to lengthen the average maturity of the deposit
resources in the banking system. The Central Bank will continue to review
trends in domestic as well as international credit markets, in conjunction
with the Government's inflation control program. Once inflationary
expectations have been lowered sufficiently, it is the Government's intention
to liberalize deposit rates so that they are determined by market forces.
7.       In the area of lending, the Government recognizes that interest rates
remain high in real terms and tend to hinder investments. The Government's
objectives are to (i) reduce the difference between the interest rates on
preferential and non-preferential credits, (ii) reduce the flow of
preferential credit, and (iii) encourage the availability of medium and long
term credit for the productive sectors of economy. Substantial progress has
already been achieved in reducing the difference between the interest rates
on preferential and non-preferential credits during the past two years.
Interest rates on preferential credits available through the Central Bank's
rediscount facility have been raised by an average of about 17 percentage
points since the end of 1983, and banks are permitted to charge their normal
interest rate on the non-rediscounted part of a loan, thus raising the total
cost to the borrower of a typical blended loan package to real positive rates
for most categories of preferential credits. As a result of the substantial
rationalization of the rediscount facility in the past two years, there exist
basically only five categories of rediscount rates at present, as compared to
more than 30 categories three years ago. The total flow of credit through the
various rediscount windows has also been reduced sharply. The combination of
reduced flows and higher interest rates has resulted in a decline in the
proportion of preferential credit to the productive sectors of the economy to
only about 13 percent of total credit as of September 30, 1985. The
Government's intention is to maintain the progress in rationalization of
rediscount rates, with the objective of providing uniform treatment for all
investment credits supported by the facility.



- 51 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 10
8.            The Government remains cLmmitted to achieving positive real
levels on preferential credits to the productive sectors of the economy by the
end of 1986. The Government proposes to ensure that these interest rates
remain at positive levels thereafter by periodically reviewing and adjusting
the rates. As a result of periodic adjustment, the Government plans to reduce
and eliminate the implied subsidies on preferential credits to the productive
sectors.
9.            In order to stimulate privace investment, the Government intends
to encourage the development of a resilient system of medium and long term
lending. This will require the strengthenir.g of the capability of the
commercial banks to appraise investment projects, and placing the resource
availability to the development banks on a sound footing.  Commercial banks
a'ready have the freedom to set and adjusL Lheir lending rates in the light of
market conditions. The Government also intends to pursue the introduction of
interest rate mechanisms on medium and long term rediscounted loans designed
to reduce the interest rate risk to both borrowers and lenders in an
environment of fluctuating inflation.
10.           In 1984, the Government introduced a scheme to protect borrowers
of long term foreign currency loans for investment purposes from foreign
currency risk, and thus to encourage investment.  This sc:eme, which is
intended to be a temporary expedient until the investment climate improves, is
under the Government's constant review. An examination of the need for the
continuation of the scheme will be carried out before the end of 1986, taking
into account the prevailing rate of inflation, the cost of financing from
other sources and the level of private sector investment.
11.           As a further measure to encourage the flow of credit from the
banking system to the private sector, the Government is introducing a
withholding tax on the income from holdings of Government bonds. This is
expected to bring the return, on an after-tax basis, of bond holdings closer
to the return on loans to the private s6ector, and thus encourage the use of
the commercial banks' loanable funds for lending to the private sector.
The Banking System
12.           The Government's long-term objective is to enhance Turkey's
growth prospects by improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the
financial sector, and particularly of its most important component, the
commercial banking system. These objectives are proposed to be achieved by
fostering increased competition to reduce intermediation margins,
strengthening the role of the Central Bank in offsite monitoring of commercial
banks, improving transparency in the functioning of banks by the introduction
of standardized accounting and by the introduction of independent external
audit ef banks. The banking law which was introduced in 1983 has already
brought about improvements in the functioning of the banks. The law was
further revised in 1985. The Government has licensed more foreign banks to
open branches in Turkey. The number of foreign banks has grown from six in
1980 to 16 in mid-1985, thus encouraging competition among banks. The number
of foreign banks is expected to increase further.



- 52 -
ANNEX IV
Page 5 of 10
13.      The accounting system required in the banks has been completely
standardized following a major study carried out with the assistance of
consultants. Extensive discussions have been held hith the banks, and the new
system is to be followed from January 1, 1986. Urder the new system of
accounts, banks will be required to provide regular reports to the Banking
General Directorate of the Treasury, the Central Bank, and the Board of Sworn
Bank Examiners. These reports are designed to render the accounts of the
banks much more transparent and will enable the Government to monitor the
banks' performance more effectively and in a timely fashion.
14.      The introduction of the new accounting system and the Government's
objective of improving the efficiency of the banks has brought with it the
need to revise the system of bank supervision. The Government has decided
that the responsibility for the offsite monitoring of commercial banks would
be with the Central Bank. For this purpose, a monitoring and surveillance
department is being set up in the Central Bank. The Board of Sworn Bank
Examiners, which is responsible for the audit of banks, is also in the process
o' revising its audit methods to give greater emphasis to the setting up of
management control systems in the banks rather than the detailed scrutiny of
individual transactions. The Government would welcome technical assistance to
train staff of these agencies to fulfill their increased responsibilities.
15.      Simultaneously with the introduction of standardized accounting in
the banks, the Government has announced that bank financial statements will be
required to be audited by independent external auditors commencing from 1987.
The Government is in the process of formulating criteria for the appointment
of auditors in time for implementation of this requirement.
16.      The capital adequacy of banks is being addressed by the Government
through provisions requiring higher minimum capitalization under the new
banking law. The capital structure of banks has been affected in recent years
by low profitability and by the bad and doubtful loans carried on their
books. With the liberalization of lending rates, banks have b-en able, in
1984-85, to increase their profits and to build up reserves. The standardized
e^-ounting system will also enable an accurate assessment to be made of the
ex.ent of non-performing loans in the portfolios of banks. Ir. the near
future, the Government intends to take additional measures to enable banks to
set aside adequate provisions, such as permitting them to deduct provisions
for non-performing loans from their taxable profits.
Capital Market Development
17.      The development of the manufacturing and non-financial services
sector in Turkey has in most cases been more dynamic than the development of
its financial instruments.  The term-to-imaturity of credit available in the
capital markets and the type of access to financial services available to many
firms are now seen to be a constraint to healthy growth of the corporate
sector. The part of the financial sector through which these problems are to
be addressed is the capital market. An enhanced role for this market would
help to make risk-reward relationships more transparent. It would also permit
firms to adjust their financial structure to lessen some of their debt burden,
assist entrepreneurs seeking to raise funds and permit greater private
participation in capital gains produced by economic growth.

ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 10
18.     The Government has introduced measures to improve the regulatory
framework within which the capital market functions in the capital narket law
which was issued in 1982. Further measures the Government intends to
introduce will be aimed at improving the quality and quantity of the
information regarding corporate finances available to prospective investors in
che market. In approximately the same time-frame as that intended for the
introduction of external audit in the banking system, external audit of
corporati3ns 4.a'iing securities in the market will be introduced.  In parallel
with the aLtroductlon of audit, the issue of commercial paper will be
liberalized to enable corporations to meet their short-term requirements
direc6ly from savers through the capital market.
19.     The Government is committed to the use of financial incentives to
promote the widening of shareholding in Turkey, in recognition of the social
benefits that result from increased shareholding by the public. Steps already
taken in this direction include removal of the ceiling of TL 3.0 million on
tax exempt income on equity holdings of individuals. Encouragement is also
being provided to corporations to issue additional capital to widen their
equity base by exempting premiums on issue of fresh shares from taxation.
20.     Tax concessions which would provide an incentive to corporations to
issue shares to the public are also under the consideration of the Government,
although this step will have to be taken concurrently with the introduction of
external audit of the corporations issuing the shares and also keeping in view
the likely impact on Government revenues.
21.     The inter-bank money market has grown rapidly in Turkey in response
to the reduction in the financial trarAsactions tax from 15 percent in 1982 to
3 percent in 1984. The Government intends to support the growth of the
inter-bank market, which would enable banks to employ their short term
liquidity and improve efficiency in resource utilization. To this end, the
Government is seeking legislative approval to further reduce the financial
transactions tax.
Development of the Accounting Profession
22.     As the liberalization of the banking system and the development of
the capital market on a healthy basis will require provision of reliable
financial information to the public as well as the Government, the Government
has introduced legislation to set up a Board of Sworn Financial Advisers which
would set standards for auditors, educational and training requirements, and
criteria for admission to the accounting and audit profession. The Board is
expected to be set up, subject to passage of the legislation in the Grand
National Assembly, by mid-1986.
Medium-Term Measures
23.      In addition to the above measures which the Government is already in
the process of implementing, it is also intended that additional measures to
diversify the range of services offered by the financial sector will be

studied by the Government. These relate among others to the setting up of an
export credit insurance scheme, as well as the provision of medium and long
terD credit to promote exports of capital goods. As the capital market
develops, the Government also intends to take up the question of encouraging
