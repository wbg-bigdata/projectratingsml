FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republic of Turkey.
Beneficiaries;         The Undersecretariat of the Treasury and Foreign Trade,
the Central Bank, the Capital Market Board, the Board of
Sworn Bank Examiners, the Board of Sworn Financial
Advisors and the commercial banks.
Amount:                US$300 million eq-iivalent.
Terms:                 Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
Description:           The proposed loan would support the Government's
financial sector adjustment program during the two-year
period 1986-88. The principal objectives of the program
are to establish an efficient and flexible system of
resource mobilization and allocation, which would
respond rapidly to market forces and would offer a wide
variety of financial instrument to both borrowers and
savers. The principal measures to be taken would
include: (i) the reduction of subsidies on preferential
credit and achievement of positive real interest rates
on preferential credit to the productive sectors;
(ii) standardization of accounts and introduction of
external audit of commercial banks, along with
strengthening of bank supervision; (iii) development of
the capital market through reform of the regulatory
framework including introduction of external audit of
corporations; and (iv) development and introduction of
new financial services. Simultaneously, the
institutional capacities of the major agencies in the
sector adjustment process would be strengthened by
provision of technical assistance at a total foreign
exchange cost oi $3.0 million.
The loan would finance all imports with the exception of
items financed by other sources, military or
para-military items, luxury goods and nuclear reactors.



- iA-
Benefits and Risks:   The reforms agreed under the loan will help to create a
more efficient financial sector and thus enhance growth,
both by increasing savings and by channelling them to
more productive investments. In particular, by
developing a greater variety of financial instruments,
the reforms would contribute to a revival of private
investment. The main risks arise due to uncertainties
in the control of inflation, as-the persistence of high
levels of inflation is a major constraint to the
reduction of the prevailing high interest rates and
consequent corporate financial distress.  The other main
risks relate to the prospects for the rapid development
of the capital markets, and the degree of resistance
that might be encoutered in the introduction of external
audit of banks and corporations. These risks are
considered manageable in view of the progress already
made and the Government's commitment to the reform
program.
Estimated
Disbursement;         The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in two
tranches$ $200 million equivalent soon after
effectiveness, and $100 million after a performance
review expected to be carried out in July 1987.



CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a loan of $300 million to support the process
of financial sector reform in Turkey. The Fifth-Five Year Development Plan
(1985-89) charts a course for the economy wiich aims to consolidate the stabi-
lization and adjustment program begun in the wake of the economic crisis in
January 1980, and to return the economy to steady growth. Reliance on market
forces and an increased outward orientation for the economy are the central
themes of the Government's policy. The process of liberalization and adjust-
ment in the real sectors of the economy needs to be supported by eorresponding
liberalization of the financial system.
1.02     The proposed loan originated from the Bank's extensive economic and
sector work program in Turkey over the last five years. One of the important
tasks undertaken during 1982-83 was a survey of the financial sector of Turkey
(Special Economic Report -- Policies for the Financial Sector -- Report
No. 4459-TU, dated September 21, 1983). The report clearly indicated the need
for reform and restructuring of the financial sector. The urgency of action is
also underlined by the deteriorating portfolio quality of financial insti-
tutions and by the serious distortions evident in the resource allocation pro-
cess, partly caused by the lack of an efficient financial sector.
A. The Importance of Financial Sector Reform
1.03     The financial system is crucial to economic development because of its
key role in mobilizing and allocating resources, as well as in stabilizing the
economy. Recent experience has shown that the role and performance of the
financial system are intertwined with the state of the macro-economy and cor-
porate financial health, that negative real interest rates reduce domestic
resource mobilization and encourage excessive dependence on foreign capital,
and that excessive reliance on directed credit leads to inefficient resource
allocation. Buildiug a sound and efficient financial system involves much more
than creating and nurturing individual institutions. It requires a balanced
approach involving: development of appropriate financial sector policies;
promotion, in a competitive environment, of a range of financial institutions
and intermediaries capable of delivering equity and debt finance as well as
various financial services at reasonable costs; and creation of an institu-
tional infrastructure for financial information, regulation and supervision.
Finally, recent experience has confirmed that for financial sector reform to
yield its full benefits, parallel changes should be made in macro-ec3nomic and
trade policies.
1.04     Development of the financial system is closely dependent on the
policies followed for management of the overall ecc,-my. During the period
of economic and financial instability in the early .980s, countries such as
Turkey, with relatively open trade and capital markets, were especially hard
hit. Some of these countries had allowed their economies to become overheated
during the 1970s. High and fluctuating inflation, combined with delays in
interest rate adjustments, produced highly negative real rates as interest



-2-
rates remained fixed at nominal levels that were substantiaily below inflation
levels. This adversely affected mobilization of domestic savings. When low
cost foreign funds to finance budget deficits were no longer available, they
were forced to take drastic stabilization measures. The financial systems of
some of these countries actually contracted as a result and have therefore not
acquired the depth necessary to perform their functions effectively.
1.05     Conversely, the existence of a well developed financial system makes
the task of management of the macro economy and the achievement of sustained
growth rates easier. The financial sector is a service sector which affects
all productive sectors of the economy. The contribution of the finaacial
sector to the econoay depends on the quality and quantity of the services it
produces and the efficiency with which they are produced. The financiai sector
fosters capital accumulation by providing assets which are attractive ia terms
of yield, risk and maturity.  It also plays an important role in improving
allocation of capital by pooling the savings of surplus entities to finance
large investment projects. Finally, the financial sector enables term trans-
formation of maturities, by matching the preference of savers for short-term
investments with the longer term needs of investors for investment finance.
An efficient financial sector thus enhances growth, both by increasing the
financial savings ratio and by channelling savings to financing higher yielding
investments.
B. The Objectives of Financial Sector Reform
1.06     The objectives of financial sector reform are:  (i) to deepen the
financial system by channelling an increasing proportion of capital accumu-
lation through the formal financial system, in order to improve the allocation
of savings in the economy; (ii) to expand the consolidation of relatively small
pools of private savings into institutional hands to permit the allocation of
these funds to large productive investments; and (iii) to improve term trans-
formation by converting a larger proportion of short-term financial surpluses
into longer-term resources needed to finance capital investments. These objec-
tives can be translated, in systemic terms, as seeking the establishment, over
the medium term, of an efficient and flexible system of resource mobilization
and allocation, which would grow in real terms to meet the needs of Turkey's
modernizing economy and which would respond rapidly to market forces, would
offer a wide variety of instruments to both borrowers and savers yielding
positive returns in real terms, and make resources available at positive real
rates.
C. Role of the Bank Group
1.07     Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the Bank's
operational discussion with the Government has been the structural adjustment
lending (SAL) program, which was completed in June 1984. Significant progress
has been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by
no means over. Recent economic developments have underlined the need for a
continuation of the stabilization program without giving up the goals of sec-
toral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank lending in the post-SAL period



-3-
would be on striking an appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment lending
designed in part to be quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in
the major sectors, and carefully formulated project lending focussing on high
priority projects principally in the agriculture, energy, industry and
transport sectors.
1.08     The Bank Group has been involved in the Turkish financial sector
through projects to support industrial development, agricultural credit ope-
rations, and technical assistance to the Capital Market Board through IFC.
Joint ventures in merchant banking and manufacturing projects have also been
supported by IFC. The Bank group has had continuing dialogue with the
Government regarding measures to be implemented as a part of financial sector
adjustment.  As a result, the Government has already given effect to many of
the recommendation made in the report of the Financial Sector Survey. The
proposed loan would be an outcome of the close dialogue-and help to place the
sector adjustment program on a sound medium-term footing.
CHAPTER II
THE MACRO-ECONOMIC SETTING
2.01     Turkey's structural adjustment program has brought about major reforms
in the macro-economic environment, particularly in exchange rates, the trade
regime, the incentives framework, the taxation system, pricing policies, the
state enterprise sector, and the planning framework. Most of the reforms were
aimed at accomplishing two central medium-term objectives - opening up Turkey's
economy to market forces and pressures and achieving an outward orientation.
The macro-policy-framework put in place since 1980 mainly affects the real
sectors of the economy, principally agriculture, industry and energy, but it
also affects in a major way how the financial sector operates. The purpose of
this chapter is to review the main results of the adjustment program, the
issues that now appear important in the macro-economic setting, and to assess
the prospects for macro-economic developments as the background for the
financial sector adjustment program.
A. The Economic Adjustment Program: 1980-1986
2.02     Despite the fairly tight monetary and fiscal policies followed by the
Government as part of the stabilization program, Turkey's GDP has grown at an
ar.nual average rate of 4.7 percent in real terms during 1980-84. The highest
growith was zecorded in 1984 (5.8 percent), while in 1985 the economy grew by a
more moderate 4.9 percent. The main engine of growth has been the impressive
growth in exports at an average annual rate of 25 percent over the period
1981-85. Domestic demand on the other hand has been constrained throughout
most of this period. Export growth has been particularly evident in the manu-
facturing sector, where value-added grew by 9.3 percent in 1984 and 6.6 percent
in 1985. It also benefitted the agricultural sector where output grew by
positive 3.0 and 2.3 percent in 1984 and 1985 respectively, following a decline
in 1983. Exports are dominated by private sector producers who nave made con-
siderable strides in improving product quality and in producing and delivering
goods in a timely manner. Production bottlenecks have been considerably alle-
viated as a result of a substantial increase in electricity production, and
better availability of other inputs due to import liberalization.



-4-
2.03     The stabilization program involves consolidation of this process,
particularly in the industrial and financial sectors.  Liberalizatior of the
economy has been sequenced appropriately starting with the introduction of an
active exchange rate policy, followed by coordinated actions relating to the
public enterprise sector and the relaxation of price controls, import restric-
tions and investment licensing. The financial sector is new being liberalized
following the reforms in the real sectors. Already few restrictions exist
regarding movements in items affecting the capital account. Turkish citizens
are now able to hold foreign-exchange denominated deposits and to remit capital
abroad fairly easily. This is linked to the continued application of a
realistic flexible exchange rate policy based on the daily determination of the
exchange rate by the Central Bank against a basket of currencies of Turkey's
major trading partne"a. This key factor in Turkey's export drive aims at
making the Turkish Lira fully convertible in the near future. While not an end
itself, convertibility of the Lira would represent proof of the successful
liberalization of the Turkish economy in general and of the financial sector
in particular. Hence, it would enhance the image of Turkey in international
credit markets. In the last five years Turkey's standing has already improved
considerably as demonstrated by the fact that since 1983, foreign commercial
borrowings exceeded loans from official sources.
B. Issues in the Macro-Economic Setting
2.04     Despite the impressive results achieved under the adjustment program,
there are two issues in the macro-economic setting which have substantial
impact on the health of the financial sector. These are: (i) control of
inflation, and (ii) sustaining the export drive, through increase in manufac-
turing investment in the private sector. The prospects for the resolution of
these issues are discussed below.
1. Inflation Control
2.05     Turkey's persistent, though declining, high inflation rate still
remains the main problem. In 1984 the inflation rate reached 50 percent, up
from 31 percent in 1983. By March 1985 it had reached 60 percent. However,
since April 1985 there has been a steady decline in the inflation rate, with
the year-on-year change in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) hovering around 36
to 38 percent in most monchs. The inflation rate for the year 1985 was about
43 percent, influenced by the substantial SEE price increases in the first
quarter. However, measured on a month-over-month basis, the inflation rate
appears lower: the December 1985/December 1984 WPI increase was 38.3 percent.
Price behaviour in the first quarter of 1986 confirms the picture that the
inflation rate is declining. The March 1986/March 1985 WPI increase was 29.3
percent, and it seems reasonable to expect this trend to continue and result
in an inflation rate under 30 percent by end of 1986. Four factors can be
identified as being among the root causes of the high rate of inflation in
1984-85: (i) prices of imported goods and inputs pushed upwards by the
creeping devaluation of the Turkish Lira; (ii) sizeable "catch-up" increases
in prices of products of State Economic Enterprises (SEE), including in energy
and transportation; (iii) pressures on domestic food prices in particular, due
to the greater proportion of agricultural output exported; and (iv) intro-
duction of the value-added-tax put some pressures on prices. Some of these



-5-
inflationary pressures are not currently present to the same degree,-but even
at a reduced level, an inflation rate of 30 percent poses very considerable
stress on the financial system, as it results in high interest rates, leading
to deterioration in loan portfolio quality and consequent reduction in profi-
tability of financial institutions. The difficulties being experienced in
control of inflation in Turkey can be viewed from the twin aspects of
management of the budget deficit and control of growth in money supply as
discussed below.
2.06     The Budget Deficit.  The budget deficit rose -rom 2.1 percent of GNP
in 1982 to 3.3 percent in 1983 and 5.0 percent in 1984. The Government moved
in 1985 to restore fiscal balance. Originally, it hoped to reduce the deficit
to TL 250 billion, as compared to TL 930 billion in 1984. However, the out-
turn for 1985 was a deficit of about TL 530 billion which represents about 2.3
percent of the 1985 estimated GNP. The main measures used to achieve this
improvement were the strengthening of tax collections and the implementation
of some new taxes, the most important of which is the value-added-tax (VAT).
In 1985, the VAT netted about TL 1,070 billion of revenues, comopared to a
target of TL 760 billion. Also, Government current and capital expenditures
were curtailed, including limiting wage increases to about 35 percent on
average. It appears that these is still substantial capacity irt the country
to increase revenues further. In fact, the ratio of budgetary revenues to GDP
was about 15.4 percent in 1984, which is low for a country of Turkey's level of
development. Budgetary revenues would have appeared higher if certain taxes
and levies which were allocated to two new extra-budgetary funds (the Mass
Housing Fund and the Public Participation Fund) had been included in budgetary
revenues, which would have raised the ratio of budgetary revenues to GNP in
1984 to about 16.4 percent.
2.07     The persistent budget deficit has had a marked effect on the financial
sector, felt principally through the Government's program of public borrowing
to finance the deficit. In 1985, the Government issued TL 1,200 billion of
Treasury bills and bonds. Most of the instruments were under one-year maturity
and some of the debt instruments were for refinancing maturing debt. In May
1985, the Gciqrnment began to issue these bills by public auction, on a regular
weekly basis. On an average, about TL 30 billion of bills have been auctioned
every week at a market determined yield of about 50-53 percent. While this
development is welcome from the point of view of requiring the Government to
pay a market yield on its borrowings, it could lead to the Government's
crowding-out private borrowers from the market. The interest earned on the
Treasury bills is tax-free, thus the nominal yield of 50 percent represents a
tax-adjusted yield of at least about 65-75 percent, depending on the tax
position of the financial institution holding the bonds. It appears that
financial institutions, which are the major participants in the auctions,
clearly prefer to subscribe to such risk-free bonds rather than lend to corpo-
rations and smaller firms, given that the return on loans to private borrowers
is not much higher, on a tax-adjusted basis. The emphasis of the Governmean
measures is therefore on reduction of the deficit by reduction of expenditures
and revenue increases, rather than increase in debt financing. As a part of
the monitoring program agreed with the Government (para 2.14), the Bank will
continue to monitor progress by the Government in reducing its fiscal deficit.



6
2.08     Growth of Honey Supply.  A second element hampering inflation control
has been the rapid growth of money supply. In fact consistent management of
the money supply has proven difficult for Turkey's policy-makers, partly
because of budget deficits, partly because the inadequacy of available monetary
policy instruments made it difficult to control monetary aggregates, and partly
because of the build-up of foreign exchange deposits in recent years which
cannot be sterilized easily. In 1984 broad money (M2) defined as cash plus
demand and time deposits grew by 57 percent, while broad money defined as M2
pltis foreign exchange deposits (M2X) grew by 73 percent. These increases
were well above the authorities' targets of 51 and 59 percent respectively.
The Central Bank has made considerable effort3 to maintain control of the
growth of monetary aggregates by setting limits on the growth of net domestic
assets of the Central lank and on the growth of reserve money.  In addition,
the success of the effort required that the reserve money multiplier remained
at about 2.3. However, during 1984 commercial banks sold large amounts of
foreign exchange to the Central Bank which increased the amount of reserve
money, while the reserve money multiplier rose as the public increased deposits
at commercial banks. In response, the authorities took several steps during
1984-85 to tighten monetary control. They (i) lowered the Central Bank buying
rate for foreign exchange, thus discouraging the sale of foreign currency by
commercial banks to the Central Bank; (ii) introduced compulsory reserve requ.-
rements for foreign exchange deposits; (iii) raised the liquidity reserve
requirement on commercial banks from 10 to 15 percent of their deposit base;
(iv) absorbed part of the liquidity in the system by issue of large volumes of
Treasury bonds (about TL1,200 billion) mainly to financial institutions; and
(v) curtailed the rediscounts of selective credits. Despite these efforts the
reserve money rmultiplier still rose to nearly 2.5 and the growth of money
supply remained high, as shown below;

-7-
2.09     The main reason for high rates of growth in broad money appears to be
the Central Bank's inability to curtail the growth of reserve money as a result
of large increases in Central Dank credit to the public sector. In particular:
(i) Central Bank advances to the Treasury, to refinance publicly held Treasury
bonds; (ii) Central Bank credit to the Treasury to consolidate the debt of SEEs
to the Central Bank; and (iii) Central Bank credit to the Soil Producte Office
(TMO) to finance agricultural purchases. Another reason for the rise in the
reserve money multiplier was the gradual reduction in the level of compulsory
reserve deposits required from commercial banks (the reserve ratio) from 25 to
19 percent of deposits. To offset the impact of the lower reserve ratio the
Central Bank steadily decreased the interest paid on reserve deposits from an
annual rate of about 25 percent in early 1985 to 5 percent as of December 1985,
and finally stopped payment of interest on reserve deposits from January 1,
1986, which helped to slow the injection of liquidity into the system. Inspite
of all these efforts, the high growth of M2 during 1985 posed a considerable
liquidity overhang as of December 1985. Considering the above, it does seem
that: (i) monetary growth was higher than the dictates of inflation control
warranted; and (ii) a tighter monetary program will be needed in 1986 and
probably in 1987 as well. The Government's policies are taking account of
these concerns, which will be monitored closely by the Bank as discussed in
para 2.14. These conclusions support the assessment that the financial sector
will continue to function under difficult, though improving circumstances
during 1986-87.
2. The Export Drive
2.10     Export sustainability is the key to the success of Turkey's develop-
ment strategy. The growth of exports projected for the period 1985-90 (8.6
percent) is consistent with the trade policies undertaken by the Government.
However, other conditions will be necessary to sustain export growth, inclu-
ding: (i) the continuation of favorable demand conditions for Turkey's exports,
particularly in the Middle East; 1/ and (ii) the undertaking of required in-
vestments in export industries that are approaching full capacity utilization.
The private sector is expected to play a key role in supporting export growth
and employment. The Fifth Plan calls for a significant increase in private
fixed investment during the 1986-89 period (about 10 percent on average per
annum), as compared to the dismal growth of -6 percent per annum recorded
during the 1979-83 period. The trend has since been reversed in 1984 when
private fixed investment grew by 7.1 percent, and in 1985 when it is estimated
to have grown also by 7.1 percent. Nevertheless, the Fifth Plan target appears
formidable and its attainment will critically depend on the reform of the
financial sector and on stabilizing inflation. Sustained actions are needed
in the financial sector to reduce the current high real interest rates for
aon-preferential borrowing (currently 30 percent p.a.), reduce the high cost of
financial intermediation, address the high level of non-performing loans,
1/ To take account of the recent decrease in oil prices, growth of Turkey's
exports to the Middle East has been scaled down in the Bank's medium-term
projections, described in paras 2.12-2.13, although projected growth in
exports to OECD countries is likely to offset this to some extent.



-8-
increase the availability of medium- and long-term industrial lending parti-
cularly by the commercial baAks, and to develop new financial services and
instruments to meet the needs of Turkish exporters. Under the loan, the
Government has therefore agreed to introduce new financial services, such as
medium- and long-term export credit and export credit insurance to sustain the
export drive.
2.11     If the level of investment in the private manufacturing sector were
not to pick up the slack in the demand for credit, the result would be more
modest growth of the financial system. On the other hand, the financial system
could benefit, at least temporarily, from a relatively slow growth in demand
for long-term investment resources, as available funds could be employed in
higher-yielding, short-term trade credit. Over the medium-term, however, the
lack of growth if the borrower base will inevitably affect the growth of the-
financial system. The lending and economic/sector work of the Bank over the
next five years would focus on assisting Turkey to revitalize the investment
climate and its exports.
C. The Outlook for 1986 and Beyond
2.12     The Bank's medium-term projections indicate the need for a conti-
nuation of the stabilization program well into 1987, implying a lower GNP
growth rate than the average 6 percent planned for the initial years of the
Five-Year Plan. Indeed, it may not be realistic to aim for GNP growth of
above 6 percent until the second half of the Plan period. This approach is in
line with Government thinking, as reflected in the revised program implemented
in 1985 and in the revised 1986 program. The reviced 1985 program and the
proposed 1986 program were reviewed by the Bank, and the 1986 proposals have
been incorporated into the Bank's medium-term projections for Turkey which are
summarized in the table below. The projections highlight the concern that
Turkey's creditworthiness could be put at risk if the Government were to relax
stabilization policies thus undermining the foundation for sustainable growth.
2.13     The difficulties the authorities have experienced in achieving fiscal
balance, and controlling monetary expansion, suggest that no matter how suc-
cessful liberalization policies are in improving the functioning of the finan-
cial system, the achievement of both high economic growth and disinflation
aimed at in the Plan may be overly optimistic. Thus, the Bank projections
indicate a lower GDP growth than the 6 percent contained in the plan, with a
target of 5.7 per annum on average, based on a low of 5.3 percent per annum
during 1986-87 and a high rate of 6.0 percent per annum during 19d8-90.
Inflation is assumed to decline to 30 percent in 1986, at a more slow pace
than the Government predicts, unless more drastic steps are taken. However,
an inflation target of 18 percent for 1990 appears feasible. The implications
for the financial sector of this assessment are: (a) a slower growth in time
deposits compared to 1984-85 due to the need to curb the growth of broad money
(M2) and, (b) a slowing down of the Government's borrowing program as a
result of the reduction of the budget deficit. The consequences of these
developments could be towards lower interest rates in general. On the other
hand, maintenance of a tight monetary policy and curtailment of domestic
demand as part of the inflation control program could maintain an upward
pressure on lending rates, though not necessarily at the current high real
levels.



-9.,
2.14     As a part of its ongoing economic work, the Bank will monitor the
developments in the macro-economy on a regular basis, and satisfactory per-
formance of the macro-economy will be a major prerequisite for the release of
the second tranche of the loan. The principal indicators which will be moni-
tored will be those which relate to: (i) inflation control (Budget deficit/
GNP, growth of money supply; (ii) balance of payments (BOP deficit, growth of
exports and debt service ratio); (iii) public investment (ratio of public
sector/private sector investment, SEE profits/GNP, public sector borrowing
requirements/GNP); and (iv) the growth of private investment, especially-in
the manufacturing sector. The targets against which the indicators will be
monitored will be those derived from the Bank's projection in the table below.

CHAPTER III2
THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
3.01     The structure and performance of Turkey's financial sector has been
markedly affected by two major developments during the last six years, These
are: (i) the liberalization and subsequent rise in deposit rates, and (ii) the
growth of Government borrowing. The rise in deposit rates to positive real
levels has deepened the financial sector and also brought about major changes
in the composition of money supply. These changes have in turn affected the
cost and the manner in which the Government has financed the budget deficit.
The Government's recourse to borrowing at market rates, as opposed to borrowing
from the Central Bank to finance the budget deficit has also brought about
changes in the functioning of the financial system.  These developments are
described in this chapter, along with the issues now requiring attention, and
the manner in which they are proposed to be addressed under the reform program.
A. Structure, Depth and Growth
1. Structure
3.02     The financial system of Turkey consists of (a) the Central Bank and
the commercial banks; (b) the development banks; (c) the social security
system; (d) insurance companies and credit cooperatives; and (e) the securities
market. Although, Government incentives and the sale of Government bonds have
encouraged the development of a more active securities market in the past few
years, commercial banks still dominate the financial system. In the early
1980s, commercial banks accounted for about 65 percent of the total domestic
resources mobilized by the financial system, the Central Bank for 20 percent,
the social security system for 10 percent and other institutions for 5 percent.
The social security system has become less significant, as its share in the
financial system declined steeply from 23 percent in the early 1970s to less
than 10 percent in 1983 as a consequence of erosion by high inflation of the
real value of its outstanding assets. Domestic bonds issued by the development
banks (DYB, TSKB, Desiyab, etc.) accounted for a small proportion of the total
domestic assets in the Turkish financial system as shown in the following
table.

- 11 - 
3.03     Total domestic resources of the financial system declined rapidly
from 54 percent of GDP in 1970 to 40 percent in 1981 as the return on financial
assets became highly negative in the late 1970s due to low deposit rates under
conditions of high inflation (see Chapter IV). The liberalization of deposit
interest rates in July 1980, (see below) however, restored returns to positive
levels and helped to raise the value of total financial assets to 48.7 percent
of GDP in 1985. The interest rate reform benefitted mainly the banking sector
whose share of total resources in the financial system increased to 69.2 per-
cent in 1985.
2. Death of the Financial Sector
3.04     As stated at the outset, a major objective of financial sector reform
is to deepen the financial system by bringing the bulk of capital accumulation
into the formal financial system, thus to improve resource allocation.  The
K2/GDP ratio is indicative of the absolute size of the banking system in-
cluding the Central Bank, and of the stock of liquidity available. This ratio
is generally between 30-35 percent in middle income countries. In the case of
Turkey, frequent changes in the Government's interest rate policy have affected
the ability of banks and other institutions to mobilize domestic resources.
Consequently, the depth of the Turkish financial system, as measured by the
M2/GDP ratio, has fluctuated widely over the past 15 years as shown in the
following table.

a/ Quarterly geometric averages.
Source: Mision estimates.
3.05     The substantial rise in the M2/GDP ratio in 1981-82 was due to the
effective lifting of ceiling on deposit rates in July 1980. Deposit interest
rates rose substantially and have remained generally at positive levels in real
terms thereafter (see paras 4.02 - 4.05). In response to the interest rate
reform, M2 grew on average by 58 percent per annum in the period 1981-83,
while inflation averaged 33 percent per annum. The financial depth achieved as
a result of the interest rate reform brought the M2/GDP ratio from 15.8 per-
cent in 1980 to 22.9 percent in 1985, thought it failed to bring the M2/GDP
ratio back to its 1972-73 level of 27.2 percent. It should be noted however
that the M2 figures exclude holdings of Government bonds outside the banking



- 12 -
sector as well as foreign currency deposits by residents. The latter have
grown vety rapidly in recent months and reached nearly US$2.0 billion by the
end of 1985 representing approximately 2.8 percent of GDP. Taking into account
foreign currency deposits And Government bonds held outside the banking system,
the size of the financial system is probably about 26-27 percent of GDP at
present. This is still rather low for a country at Turkey's stage of economic
development but it represents a considerable improvement over the of 1980.
3. Growth and Shares of Credit
3.06     Total credit extended by the financial sector -  including the Central
Bank, deposit money banks and investment and development banks -- has grown
from TL 796 billion in 1979 to TL 5,851 billion in September 1985, excluding
holdings of Government bonds by commercial banks (see Annexes 2, 3 & 4). This
45 percent p.a. increase in nominal terms has been characterized by very subs-
tantial fluctuations in real terms. During 1980 the volume of credit out-
standing fell by 19.2 percent in real terms, and has slowly increased there-
after. The sharp fall in 1980 has resulted in a decline in credit in real
terms from TL 796 billion in 1979 to TL 606 billion in September 1985 (in 1979
prices), a decline at a compounded annual rate of 4.6 percent. The sharpest
decline has been in direct credit extended by the Central Bank to the Govern-
ment, as the Government has resorted increasingly to financing the budget
deficit by issue of bonds which are purchased mostly by commercial banks,
rather than by borrowing from the Central Bank. Consequently, holdings of
Government bonds by commercial banks increased from only Ti 32.3 billion in
1979 to Ti 1,080 billion in 1985. If commercial bank bond holdings are
included in credit, total credit extended by the financial system would have
declined at a smaller rate of 2.4 percent in real terms. The rising volumes
of Government bond issues which have been purchased by commercial banks have
been partially substituting for credits to the private sector. While fears of
crowding out the private sector may be excessive, the following table shows
that the share of the private sector in total domestic credit declined in
1984-85 following a steady increase since 1980.

B. Impact of Interest Rate Reforms
3.07     In addition to the effect on the structure, depth and growth of the
financial system, the liberalization of interest rates have also produced
other changes, including (i) changes in the composition of money supply, (ii)
shortening of deposit maturity, (iii) changes in the financing of the budget
deficits, and (iv) changes in the role of the Central Bank. These changes are
discussed below.
1. Changes in the Composition of Money Supply
3.08     The composition-of money supply has changed during 1980-85 because of
the large differentials in the yields offered on the various types of financial
instruments. Interest bearing time and savings deposits (M2-Md)increased
rapidly from 2.6 percent of GDP in 1980 to 6.7 percent in 1981 and 13.0 percent
in 1984. There was also a shift within money supply from non-interest or low
interest bearing instruments (i.e. currency and demand deposits) to interest
bearing time and savings deposits. As a consequence, the ratio of M1 fell,
as a percentage of GDP, from 17.3 percent in 1979 to 9.9 percent in 1984.

Source; Mission estimates.
3.09     In aggregate, sight, time and savings deposits have increased their
share of monetary assets from nearly 72 percent in 1979 to about 88 percent
in 1985. On the other hand, currency issued by the Central Bank has declined
from 28.3 percent to 15.0 percent. This change in the composition of money
supply has increased the relative importance of commercial banks within the
financial system. Until 1980, the share of non-interest (currency) or low-
interest (sight deposits) bearing instruments in total money supply was more
than 80 percent, an extremely high proportion for a country at Turkey's stage
of development. By 1985, however, they accounted for 36 percent only, wbile
time and savings deposits had risen from 15 percent to 64 percent. The reason
for this dramatic change is the large differential in the comparative yields of
these financial instruments. Since 1981, time and savings deposits have been
yielding nominal interest rates of approximately 50 percent p.a. The rapid
fall in the share of currency within money supply reflected the high oppor-
tunity cost of holding zero-yielding cash balances compared to a 50 percent
yield on time and savings deposits. Holdings of sight deposits have declined
in relative terms for the same reason. The interest rate on sight deposits has
been kept at a very low level of 5 percent which made these holdings barely
more attractive than currency. As a consequence their share of money supply
has been cut in half from 56.6 percent in 1979 to 21.4 percent in 1985.

2. Changes in Deposit Cost and Maturity
3.10     The drastic changes in the composition of financial assets have
increased the average cost of bank deposits rapidly. As low cost sight
deposits declined as a proportion of bank deposits, the increasing share of
time deposits carrying higher interest rates has pushed up the average interest
cost of bank deposits from about 30 percent in 1982 to over 40 percent in 1985.
a rate close to the rate of inflation. These cost increases have put pressures
on banks to improve their efficiency. Many uneconomic brancties, principally in
rural areas, which were able to operate profitably because cneap sight deposits
offset their high administrative costs, became unprofitable when the average
interest cost of deposits increased drastically.  In response to these develop-
ments, commercial banks have begun to stronger efficiency measures, including
closing down their least profitable branches. This is a positive development
that should result in reduction of intermediation costs. The rising interest
cost of bank deposits ha.s also caused a significant increase in the lending
rate of banks. Similarly, the opportunity cost to the banks of the compulsory
liquidity and reserve requirements imposed by the Central Bank has been rising
as the cost of mobilizing deposit rose. In order to mitigate the impact of
these requirements on the lending rates of commercial bataks, the Central Bank
has gradually reduced the level of reserve requirements, which will decline to
15 percent of deposits by September 1986.
3.11     In the past few years, these has been a rapid shortening of the
average maturity of all types of bank deposits from 8.8 months in 1979 to 3.4
months by the end of 1984. Excluding demand deposits, the average maturity of
time deposits has declined from 32.6 months in 1979 to 6.1 months in 1984.
This development resulted from the combination of high and volatile inflation
since 1980 with a system of fixed rather than floating deposit rates. In a
context of uncertainty as to the course of inflation, depositors have become
extremely reluctant to commit funds for more than short periods of time. In
addition, the effective compounded yield set by the Government on 12 month
deposits has been less than on 3 or 6 month deposits reflecting the
expectation that inflation will decline. The increasingly short maturity of
bank deposits puts a serious constraint on the ability of banks to lend
Turkish Lira funds on a long-term basis. This would only be possible if banks
were able to adjust the rate they charge on long-term loans to reflect the
average maturity of deposits, that is, if they moved to a system of floating
rates indexed to the average cost of commercial bank deposits. The Government
is not in a position to force the banks to do so, as banks are free to set
their lending rates, except in respect of loans rediscounted with the Central
Bank. Furthermore, at present, the Government is reluctant to introduce a
system of fully floating or variable rates in respect of rediscounted loans as
it may induce inflationary expectations. The Government has however
recognized the difficulties caused in financing of investments in the absence
of medium- and long-term lending and has agreed to design and introduce
interest rate mecha- nisms on such loans designed to reduce the interest rate
risk to both borrowers and lenders and thus to encourage medium- and long-term
lending.

3. Changes in the Financingi of the Budget Deficit
3.12     The sources of financing of the Government's budget deficit have
changed as a result of the change in the composition of monetary assets. As
currency issued by the Central Bank (which earns no interest), declined as a
proportion of M2 and also as a proportion of GDP from 5.8 percent in 1979 to
3.8 percent in I984, the ability of the Central Bank to expand its assets
without fueling inflation declined as well. Even a partial monetization of
the public sector deficit was bound to have some inflationary impact. This
consideration led the Government to increase its reliance on bond issues
principally to commercial banks as a means of financing the budget deficit.
While the issue of such bonds could have a favorable impact on the inflation
control program, as it withdraws liquidity from the system, the lags of such
liquidity contraction in 1985 has meant that its impact is beginning to be felt
only recently.  It is expected that during the next few years, a secondary
market for Government securities will be developed, with the Central Bank
undertaking open iuarket operations. This development would create an instru-
ment of monetary control which would improve inflation control.
4. Changes in the Role of the Central Bank
3.13     The interest rate reform of the early 1980s has also had consequences
which went far beyond the change in the composition of financial assets. The
changing composition of financial assets in Turkey has caused structural
changes in the role of the Central Bank relative to commercial banks within
the financial system. In order to curtail its intervertion in the economy, the
Central Bank has drastically cut its credits to public sector enterprises and
to other financial institutions, mainly the commercial banks through its redis-
counting schemes (see Chapter IV). The net increase in Central Bank claims
over the 1984-85 period has been largely due to increase in claims on the
Government for financing the budget deficit. In response to the decline in
the ratio of currency to GDP and the reduction in compulsory reserve
requirements, the Central Bank has cut the volume of its credit to public
sector enterprises also, along with reduction in rediscounting of credits by
commercial banks. In practice, the net flow of resources from the Central
Bank to commercial banks has become negative as repayments of Central Bank
advances exceeded the level of new rediscounts. Outstanding Central Bank
rediscounts to banks were cut in half in nominal terms between 1983 and 1984.
This reduction in Central Bank credit to the commercial banks has been highly
beneficial as the reduction in the proportion of such credit, generally
consisting of preferential credit at subsidized interest rates has meant an
increase in noni-preferential credit at market rates. The reduction in the
volume of Central Bank credit and reserve requirements will allow the banks to
reduce the high seal interest rates on non-preferential credit.
C. Issues in the Financial Sector
3.14     The issues in the financial sector which are being addressed in
connection with the proposed project relate to the twin objectives of
financial sector reform: improved resource mobilization and, improved
resource allocation. Progress in meeting these objectives requires that
measures be taken to address issues in the areas of (a) financial policies,
(b) financial instruments, and (c) financial institutions.



- 16 -
(a) Financial Policies
3.15     The major policy issues that appear to require resolution are:
(i) fiscal policy (reduction of fiscal deficit, inflation and crowding out of
the private sector); (ii) monetary policy (reserve and liquidity requirements
resulting in high lending rates); (iii) lending interest rates (high inter-
mediation margins and high cost of credit); and (iv) selective credit policies
(reduction of selective credits and subsidies on credit to improve resource
allocation).
(b) Financial Instruments
3.16     The major objective of future reforms should be to develop availabi-
lity of instruments for both short-term working capital and for long-term
investment resources. This requires adoption of measures to msrge growth of
(i) treasury bills, and (ii) commercial paper at the short end of the maturity
structure and (i) corporate bonds, (ii) corporate equities, and (iii) treasury
bonds at the longer end of maturity.
Cc) Financial Institutions
3.17     Considerable strengthening of financial institutions is required,
and there is also a need for new institutions and services. These objectives
require strengthening the banking system by: (i) improving supervision; (ii)
standardizing accounting and audit; and (iii) staff training. Secondly, the
money and capital markets have to be developed by: (i) improving the regu-
latory framework; (ii) improving financial disclosure requirements; and (iii)
deepening the interbank market.
3.18     The relationship of these issues with the overall objective of
financial sector adjustment and finally with the role of the financial sector
in the macro-economy is complex and very close. The chart opposite depicts
these issues within the overall framework of financial sector adjustment.
D.  The Medium-Term Adjustment Program
3.19     These overall objectives listed above are necessarily ambitious, and
can only be reached over the medium-term. The Government has committed itself
to implement the reform program within a medium term framework described in its
Statement of Financial Sector Policies-1986, which is annexed to this report
(Annex 1). While the expected results of the mediumrterm reform program can
only be delineated in indicative terms, Turkey's financial system is expected
to exhibit characteristics increasingly similar to those of the financial sys-
tems in other middle income modernizing economies, and to develop in the fol-
lowing directions: (a) financial depth, measured by the percentage of M2 to
GDP, would increase from the present 20-25 percent to 30-35 percent; (b) the
intermediation margins of commercial banks would decline to about 3-5 percent
of assets from the present level of 7-10 percent; (c) the share of long-term
instruments in financing of investments would increase to about 7-10 percent
from the present level of 3-4 percent; and (d) the issues of corporate bonds
would increase by about 50 percent (because of the low base level of such
issues at present), equity issues by about 15 percent and the volume of trading
in the interbank market by about 30 percent, all in real terms. Progress in
these directions-would be monitored with the help of key financial sector indi-
cators listed in Annex 5.

3.20     The proposed loan would achieve major progress towards the needed
reform objectives by supportins; critical actions which lie in the core area of
interest rates, selective credit policies, accounting and audit of commercial
banks, and audit of corporat ons with publicly issued securities. Under the
loan, the institutional capacities of the Treasury, the Central Bank, the
Capital Markets Board, the Commercial Banks and supervisory agencies would be
upgraded by provision of technical assist..nce. Finally, the proposed loan
would support actions to introduce new financial services such as medium-term
export credit and export cretdit insurance which would increase in importance
over the medium-term. The loan would thus touch upon and address issues
covering the major elements of the financial systems. The linkage between
sector reform objectives, sector issues and reform measures to be implemented
under the loan is shown in Annen 6.
3.21-   In sum, in the proposed loan is in support of a systematic reform
program which, when implemented, would accelerate the transformation of the
Turkish financial system from a tightly regulated, fragmented and generally
non-competitive system into a market oriented and flexible system. A wide
ranging set of measures, which the Government is committed to implement, have
been designed to ensure that the reform process is comprehensive and self-
sustaining. The full listing of the reform measures agreed with the Govern-
ment is shown in the Attachment to the Statement of Financial Sector Policies
(Annex 1, Attachment II).
CHAPTER IV
FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR STRUCTURAL CHANGE
4.01     Apart from causing changes in the structure of the assets of the
financial sector, the liberalization of the deposit rates have also affected
lending rates and the effective cost of credit. In an environment of high and
fluctuating inflation, the maintenance of positive deposit rates in real terms,
together with fairly high reserve and liquidity requirements has produced an
effective cost of borrowed funds which is perhaps unsustainably high.  The
impact of these high costs on the corporate sector and on the portfolios of
financial institution is dealt with in a subsequent chapter. The purpose of
this chapter is to set the framework within which sector policies -- i.e. those
dealing with: (i) deposit rates; (ii) lending rates; (iii) selective credit;
and (iv) preferential credit -- are formulated. The changes that have occurred
in this policy area, and the policy changes envisaged under the sector adjust-
ment program supported by the proposed loan, are then set out.
A. Interest Rates
1. Deposit Rates
4.02     Until 1980, Turkey followed a policy of fully-managed interest rates.
Deposit and lending rates were determined by the Government. Effective July 1,
1980, interest rate ceilings on bank deposits and loans were abolished, except
for a ceiling of 5 percent on sight deposits. Subsequently, deposit rates
reached highly positive levels in real terms as competition for deposits in-



- 19 -
creased among banks and money brokers. In response to excessive competition
and the collapse of a major non-bank financial intermediary (see Chapter VI),
the Government reinstated deposit interest rate ceilings in January 1983, but
these ceilings were set at positive real levels. In December 1983, lending
rates changed by financial institutions on non-preferential credits were freed.
The Central Bank was empowered to review and adjust if necessary, the ceiling
on deposit rates at least quarterly. Since then, deposit rates have been
maintained at positive real levels except on sight deposits.
4.03     The Government's decision to maintain ceilings over deposit rates was
motivated by a lack of confidence in the ability of banks to operate in a free
market environment. The financial crisis of 1982 was largely a resulL of sys-
temic inefficiencies. Since then, measures have been adopted to improve the
efficiency and to increase competition within the commercial banking sector.
The Government has encouraged the establishment of. new financial institutions
and the creation of new financial instruments. The Government's ultimate
objective is to liberalize all deposit rates fully, once the financial system
has improved its efficiency and robustness. At the present time however, the
effective cost of deposit resources is largely determined by Government deci-
sions on maximum permissible deposits yields and other regulatory requirements
such as compulsory reserves and liquidity requirements. With respect to
foreign currency deposits by Turkish residents, banks have been authorized to
determine yields freely.
4.04     Since 1983, interest rates on 3, 6 and 12-month deposits have ranged
between 45 percent and 53 percent.  At times, shorter maturities paid higher
yields, but since July 1985 the 6 and 12-month deposits have the highest
yields. The yield structure on bank deposits has been kept unchanged since
August 1, 1985. 1/ The following table shows the nominal yield on the various
maturities and the net of tax yield to depositors taking into account the 10
percent withholding tax on interest income. Comparison with the December 1984
- December 1985 rate of inflation (WPI) of 38 percent shows that real after
tax yields were significantly negative on sight deposits (-24.2 percent) but
generally positive for time deposits with real yields reaching 12.1 percent
for 6 month maturities.
l/ With effect from March 1, 1986, the nominal interest rate ceilings on
3-month and 6-month deposits were reduced by 1 and 2 percentage points
respectively. More recently, from May 1, 1986 nominal interest rate
ceilings on 3, 6 and 12-month deposits have all been reduced by 3
percentage points. In addition, the interest rate ceiling on sight
deposit has been raised to about 12 percent and with a further rise to
about 24 percent to take effect on August 1, 1986. These changes are
designed to establish a more appropriate yield-curve and deposit
structure, thus improving deposit mobilization.

4.05     While real net-of-tax yield of 12 percent may seem excessive, it is
very difficult for the banks to offer lower net-of-tax yields on Turkish Lira
time deposits below 9 percent real since foreign cur:ency deposits effectively
yield that return, if not more. At lower deposit rates, the banking system may
not be able to mobilize the domestic resources needed to maintain the growth
of the economy while financing the current levels of Government deficits.
Nominal yields on deposits of comparable maturity in US dollars and Deutsche-
marks were about 7 percent and 4 percent respectively in 1985. Taking into
account the depreciation of the Turkish Lira, against the US dollar and the
Deutschemark, effective yields including foreign exchange gains on dollar and
DM deposits reached 39 percent and 72 percent respectively. Thus, it was most
profitable for Turkish depositors to invest in DM deposits in 1985. Overall,
it seems that the 50 percent nominal yield on 6-12 months TL deposits fits
midway between effective yields on DM and US dollar deposits, and is at an
appropriate level in terms of domestic resource mobilization concerns and
alternative opportunities available to savers.
2. Lending Rates
4.06     When lending rates were regulated by the Government, it was common
practice for the banks to require eompensating deposit balances as a means of
raising effective lending rates. By and large, this practice has been
discontinued due in part to greater competition and, more importantly, to the
deregulation of lending rates. At present, lending rates charged by
commercial banks on short-term credit range between 53 and 64 percent. A
nominal rate of 60 percent represents an effective rate of about 75 percent
after quarterly compounding of interest payments. Lending rates for
medium-term investnent credit differ considerably according to purpose and
source.  Key lending rates by sector are shown in the following table.
4.07     These lending rates do not represent the final cost to the borrower
in all cases.  The financial transactions tax, bank commisions and contri-
butions to the Resource Utilization Support Fund (see para 4.16) which are
added to the base interest rate in several of the above categories of credit
raise the effective costs by about 6 percentage points. Most of the rates
applicable to medium- and long-term loans are fixed for the life of the
loans. The rates applicable to long-term housing loans (usually 15 years) are



- 21 -
varied according to the size of the housing unit. The smaller units (below 80
sq. m) being financed at interest rates nearer the lower end of the 15-40
percent interest rate range. The Government is reluctant to raise housing
credit interest rate at present because it regards provision of mass housing
at affordable costs as an important part of its effort to alleviate the social
costs of its adjustment program. As part of the Bank's economic and sector
work, a study has been undertaken of housing finance, which is expected to be
discussed with the Government later this year.
4.08     An analysis of interest rates weighted by the volume of credit out-
standing in the relevant category of credit is provided in Annex 7. The volume
weighted interest rate has risen from 36 percent as of December 31, 1982 to 42
percent by end of 1983 and further to over 51 percent by September 1985. An
analysis of the variance of the interest rates from the average of 51 percent
shows that the coefficient of variance has slowly declined, indicating that
interest rates are clustering around this level. Based on the annual average
inflation rate of 47 percent up to Sept. 1985, the average interest rate in
Turkey was 4 percent in real terms. As inflation declined to an annual average
rate of 43 percent by end of 1985, the real interest rate on credit rose to a
substantially positive level of 8 percent.

4.09     As of the end of September 1985, two-thirds of the credit outstanding
was at the highest interest rate of 61 percent.  In addition, interest is
generally charged at quarterly intervals. The effect of quarterly compounding
raises the effective cost to about 75 percent, i.e. a real interest rate of
over 40 percent. However, the real rate of 40 percent p.a. charged on
short-term credits does not represent the average cost of borrowed funds in
the corporate sector. The average cost of borrowed funds has indeed been
rising in the past few years but is mitigated by some lower rates on
preferential credits, as well as by the lower cost of short-term foreign
currency borrowings. In 1985, the effective cost of a LIBOR based dollar
borrowing was approximately 50 percent, which was significantly less than the
80 percent to 90 percent cost-of TL loans. The very high cost of Turkish Lira
borrowings has significantly reduced demand for domestic credit. Banks have
responded to this by investing liquid Ttrkish Lira assets in Government
bonds. The proportion of foreign cur' cy denominated loans extended by
domestic banks has also been rising as foreign currency deposits were
growing. The resort to short-term foreign currency denominated borrowing
poses considerable risks that short-term foreign currency debt might increase
unmanageably. The Government has therefore imposed a 3 percent surcharge on
non-export related foreign currency borrowing to curb this tendency.
B. Determinants of High Cost of Credit
4.10     There are two main reasons for the extremely high level of non-
preferential commercial banks lending rates. First, banks can only lend 66
percent of the deposit resources they mobilize due to compulsory liquidity and
reserve requirements of 15 percent and 19 percent of the deposit base res-
pectively. As a consequence the effective cost of the net loanable resources
of banks is about 1.5 times the cost of deposits, with earnings on the liqui-
dity deposits offsetting only part of this added cost. The second reason
behind high lending rates is that banks, instead of lending, have the option of
investing their loanable funds in virtually tax-free Government bonds whose net
yield is equivalent to a before tax yield of about 70 percent p.a.
4.11     In February 1986, the weighted average cost of bank deposits (sight
and time) was about 47 percent including mobilization coste. Net of yield on
reserve and liquidity requirements, the cost of loanable resources (deposits
minus reserve and liquidity deposits held in the Central Bank) was approxima-
tely 57 percent p.a. as shown in the following table (see Annex 8 for details).
The yield on reserve deposits has been sharply reduced by the Central Bank as
apart of its monetary program, and payment of interest on reserve deposits has
been stopped from January 1986. The planned reduction in the level of reserve
deposits from 19 percent to 15 percent by September 1986 will result in some
reduction of the cost of loanable funds in the next few months as shown below.

4.12     The cost effect of reserve and liquidity requirements is even more
dramatic when considering time deposits alone. In this case, the "all-in" cost
of deposits would be about 62 percent p.a.. Net of yield on liquidity deposits
(9.0 percent), the net cost of loanable deposits is estimated at 80 percent p.a
(see Annex 9). In other words, banks need to charge a lending rate of at least
56 percent to break even on a weighted average basis (combining sight and time
deposits). Based on the marginal cost of time deposits, the marginal lending
rate must be at least 80 percent p.a. to ensure break even.
4.13     The Government is aware of the cost pressures discussed above, which
keep non-preferential lending rates at a high level. Three types of measures
have been agreed to create downward pressure on lending rates. First, reserve
requirements will be gradually reduced from 20 percent in late 1985 to 15 per-
cent in September 1986. The constraint in this area is that a tight monetary
policy implies that the Central Bank cannot afford to lower the reserve
requirements any further, since this affects the money multiplier and there-
fore the liquidity injected into the economy. The second measure is to in-
crease the attractiveness of lending to the private sector by increasing the
taxation on income of corporations (including banks) arising from Government
bond holdings. The Government obtained the authority to levy a withholding
tax of up to 10 percent of interest income, It introduced a 3 percent
withholding tax on interest income from holdings of Government bonds, but
discontinued the tax temporarily due to some technical difficulties.  The
Government intends to reintroduce the tax as soon as the technical issues have
been resolved. Higher taxes on income from holdings of Government bonds would
make it comparatively more attractive for banks to make loans to the private
sector rather than invest their liquidity in Government bonds. Thirdly, the
Government has reduced the flow of rediscounted preferential credit (see
below) from the Central Bank, with the notable exception of medium-term
investment credits. This exception is designed to help maintain investment in



- 24 -
the productive sectors which would otherwise be completely stifled by real
lending rates of 35 percent or more. On medium-term rediscountable credits,
the effective uominal cost is approximately 40 percent per annum at the
present time. This level is appropriate given the need to maintain positive
real-lending rates while keeping borrowing costs significantly below market
rates on short-term commercial credits.
C. Selective Credit Policies
1.  Rediscounting of Credit
4.14     Turkey, in common with many developing countries, maintains a formal
system of selective credits to encourage the development of higher priority
sectors, such as agriculture, small scale industry and exports. However, in
Turkey there are now no mandatory controls instructing banks to lend any given
amount or proportion of their deposits to priority sectors. Rather, Turkey has
relied on the Central Bank's rediscount facility to support the selective
credit system, and to influence lending. The Government's policy regarding
interest rates, as reaffirmed under the proposed loan, is to achieve positive
interest rates for all selective credit to the productive sectors before the
end of 1986. This has been reconfirmed during negotiations.
4.15     The current structure of rediscount rates are detailed in Annex 8,
which range from 28 percent for small scale industries, 28 percent for agri-
culture and 52 percent for the "general rate". The list appears to be very
extensive, but in reality, after substantial rationalization of the scheme by
the Central Bank in the past two years, there exist only five categories com-
pared to more than 30 categories three years ago.
Central Bank Rediscount Rates on Loans
(As of January 1, 1986)
Rediscount Rate
Credit Category                              (in percent)
(i)    General Rate                                        52.0
(ii)    Agricultural Sales Cooperatives                     46.5
(iii)   Industrial investment credit                        33.0
(iv)    Agricultural Credit Cooperatives                    28.0
(v)    Small Scale Industry and Artisans                   28.0
Source: Central Bank.
4.16     The actual cost to the borrowers is higher than the rediscount rates
listed above. The lending bank's commissions (1 to 2 percentage points), the



- 25 -
contributions to the Resource Utilization Support Fund (RUSF), 1/ and in some
cases, the 3 percent financial transactions tax are added to the rediscount
rate. These "add-ons" result in a final cost of a rediscounted loan which
ranges between 30 percent for agricultural credit coops. and 61 percent for
general credit (see Annex 10). Even then the rates on agriculture credit
rediscounts cannot be said to constitute lending at negative real rates, since
the Central Bank only rediscounts a part of the loan amount, typically between
50 and 70 percent. The lending institution (commercial or development bank)
is free to charge its own interest rate on the non-rediscounted part of the
loan, which is typically around 65 percent. Thus the blended cost of a loan
package can vary between 37 and 63 percent, depending upon the terms of the
lending bank (see Annex 11 for details).
4.17     Due to the need to meet the limits to growth of net domestic assets of
the Central Bank, in accordance with the targets of the Government's monetary
program, the rediscount windows have been closed at various times, thus
reducing the stock of rediscounted credit outstanding gradually. Substantial
decreases in the flow of such credit over several quarters of 1984 and 1985
has now resulted in significant decline in the proportion of the stock of
rediscounted credit in total credit, as shown below. The fact that redis-
counted credit, which accounts for the bulk of preferential credit, amounts to
only 5.2 percent of total credit outstanding as of September 1985 demonstrates
the change that has occurred in selective credit policy over the last four
years.

17  The Resource Utilization Support Fund (RUSF) was introduced in December
1984 as a scheme to finance capital grants to investors as an incentive
for investment. Grants ranging from 7 to 20 percent of the capital costs
of a project considered to be of high priority are paid. The RUSF replaced
the Interest Rate Rebate Fund (IRRF) which was a cross subsidization scheme
used to lower the interest cost on certain types of credit. Under the
IRRF, borrowers had to pay contributions at a rate of 10 percent of the
base interest rate.  Thus, a 50 percent interest rate would become 55 per-
cent. The proceeds of the IRRF were allocated to subsidizing certain
credits -- agriculture, small industry, and FERIS loans in 1984. During
1981-84 the IRRF was in balance, i.e. contributions matched subsidies. In
1984 the Government allocated TL 35 billion to the IRRF for future ope-
rations which was transferred to the RUSF.

2. Foreign Exchange Risk
4.18     During the last five years, borrowers of loans denominated in foreign
currencies and who carried the foreign currency risk in respect of the loans
have suffered large losses due to the devaluations of the Lira.  As a result,
they became reluctant to borrow foreign currency loans, especially those with
medium and long maturities. This naturally affected the investment climate.
In response. the Government introduced a Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme
(FERIS) in 1984. Under this scheme, the foreign currency liability of a bor-
rower, who takes a mediumr- or long-term loan with a maturity of eight years or
longer for investment purposes, is converted into a TL liability at the
exchange rate prevailing on the date the loan is signed. The borrower then
repays the loan in TL and pays interest at a fixed rate, currently 35 percent,
(representing an effective rate of 42 percent after adding other changes),
which is substantially higher than the interest rate applicable to foreign
currency loans in nominal terms. The extra interest income is placed in the
FERIS fund, which repays the foreign lender in -foreign currency. Thus, the
foreign currency risk is transferred from the borrower to the FERIS fund in
exchange for the borrower paying a higher nominal interest rate on the TL
denominated liability. Any profit or loss resulting from the operation of
FERIS accrues to the FERIS fund, which is in effect guaranteed by the Govern-
ment. The FERIS interest rate, which is adjusted every six months is fixed so
as to keep the FERIS fund in approximate balance over the life of the loans.
4.19     The Bank has generally discouraged the continued resort to a fixed
rate foreign exchange risk coverage scheme, as this runs counter to the
principles of economic liberalization which drive the Governments' program.
Given the very limited prospect for private investment without such a scheme,
the Government has indicated that it would not be prepared to eliminate the
scheme until investor confidence, and a more stable inflation environment, was
restored. In the circumstances, the Bank recommended and the Government has
agreed, that the scheme should be designed to be self-financing, non-
discriminatory, and catalytic.
4.20     The climate tor private sector investment in Turkey is still not very
favorable. Private manufacturing investment is estimated to have declined by
about 5 percent in real terms during 1985. The level of applications for
investment approvals received by S0 remains very sluggish. The Government
believes that FERIS should be continued during 1986. The framework under which
the scheme now operates is largely similar to the original 1984 framework, but
the need to make the scheme self-financing has been recognized by raising the
interest rate from 26 percent to 35 percent, which results in an effective
cost of 38-42 percent, and by extending the application of the current higher
interest rate to undisbursed balances of loans signed in 1984-85. The Govern-
ment has also confirmed that -the scheme would'be discontinued as soon as the
private investment climate has revived, and has agreed to review the need for
its continuance before the end of 1986. This review will take into account
the prevailing rate of inflation, the cost of foreign currency borrowing from
other sources available to prospective investors, and the level of private
sector investment. The possibility of i-stroducing a floating rate option
under the scheme to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in a fixed rate
long term loan scheme, will be explored.



- 27 -
D. Preferential Credit
4.21     Preferential credit is defined as credit carrying interest rates below
the prevailing inflation rates. An estimate of the flow of preferential credit
extended to the productive sectors of the economy can be used to throw light on
the level of subsidy (financial and economic) in the system, and the trend in
the volume of such credit can indicate the movement of the financial system
towards market orientation. In order to measure the extent of preferential
credit in the financial system, the inflation index most relevant to use is the
change in the Wholesale Price Index over a 12 month period, i.e. the month-
over-month index. The WPI change December 1985/December 1984 was 38.3 percent,
which is used as the threshold level. All credit outstanding as of September
1985 extended at interest rates below this level is considered to be preferen-
tial. For comparison of the cost of a particular category of credit with the
-threshold level of 38.3 percent for 1985, the-final Coat -- not the rediscount
interest rate -- is used, as that represents the cost to the borrower. Fol-
lowing this methodology, the proportion of preferential credit outstanding to
the productive sectors of the economy (i.e. agriculture industry, mining,
tourism and trade) is estimated to have declined from 41.6 percent to 13.5 per-
cent during the last two years, as seen from the table below (see Annex 12).
This represents a very substantial shift to a less subsidized and therefore
more market determined credit system.

E. Reference Rate for Selective Credit
4.22     While the movement towards adjusting rediscount rates and reducing the
level of preferential credit to the productive sectors of the economy is very
substantial, the practice of adjusting rediscount rates for selective credit
on an ad-hoc basis implies that adjustments would normally lag behind changes
in the inflation rate, resulting in fluctuating real rates. Whenever the
inflation rate rises, the implied subsidy increases, unless adjustments in the
rediscount rates and other preferential credit rates (such as the interest rate
on agricultural credit extended directly by the Agriculture Bank-T.C.Z.B.) are
made, which has proved to be a cumbersome administrative process. To address



- 28 -
this problem, an appropriately formulated reference rate would help provide the
-basis for adjustments of selective credit rates.- Under such a system, the
structure of selective credit rates would be adjusted regularly on the basis of
market signals.  The development of such a system requires, as a precondition,
the existence of an interbank money market with adequate depth for determi-
nation of the cost of money at a given time. Using this rate as a basis, a
program to converge selective credit rates towards the market-determined rate
can be formulated. An important consideration in the introduction of such a
system is the need to preserve the degree of flexibility necessary to the
authorities in management of the monetary program under conditions of
fluctuating inflation. Discussions on this proposals are on-going with the
Government. Under the loan, a reference rate will be developed in order to
help the Government to monitor and adjust preferential interest rates.
CHAPTER V
STRENGTHENING THE BANKING SYSTEM
5.01     As noted earlier, the Turkish financial sector is dominated by the
banking system. A major element of the financial sector reform should there-
fore be to improve the efficiency of the banking system. The environment in
which the banks traditionally operated in Turkey was protected, non-competitive
and generally designed to ensure profitable operations of banks by restricting
the opening of branches of foreign banks and by keeping deposits rates low. In
the last six years, the environment has changed markedly. There are now 19
foreign banks which provide vigorous competition to local banks in providing
trade finance and other services. Increase in cost of deposits has reduced the
profitability and increased pressures to improve efficiency of the large retail
banks with a wide branch network. At the same time, the regulatory framework
in which the banks operate is changing in order to provide adequate protection
to depositors, which is necessary to maintain confidence and ensure deepening
of the financial system. Standardization of bank accounting and reporting
requirements have been introduced from January 1, 1986. Bank financial state-
ments will have to be externally audited commencing from the financial year
1987. Major changes are being made in the role of the Central Bank in
surveillance of banks, and the antiquated methods followed by the Board of
Sworn Bank Examiners are to be revised.
5.02     At the same time, the strain of the economic adjustment program on
the corporate sector has had an effect on the portfolio quality of commercial
banks. As overdue debt payments have mounted, the overburdened system of
collection through the courts has slowed down further, causing long delays in
loan collection. Commercial banks are passing through a very critical period,
simultaneously facing increased competitive pressures, closer scrutiny and
portfolio problems. The proposed adjustment program contains a number of
measures to improve the efficiency of Turkish banks by encouraging competition,
strengthening the supervisory system and by assisting the establishment of a
training institute to train bank staff in modern banking techniques. This
chapter reviews the roles of the Central Bank in the financial system, and that
of the Board of Sworn Bank Auditors which shares the responsibility for super-
vision of Banks with the Central Bank. The changes occurring within the com-
mercial Banks and the problems of portfolio quality and collection are also
analyzed.



- 29 -
A. Role of the Central Bank
5.03     A central feature of the Government's policies vis-a-vis the financial
sector is that the Central Bank should concentrate on implementing the
traditional role of a Central Bank and not that of a development bank, as has
been the tendency in the past. The Government now wishes to reduce Central
Bank intervention in credit allocation through the array of selective credit
schemes used very extensively in Turkey in the past. The intention is to have
the Central Bank (which was given the role of implementing such schemes) cease
to be the refinancier of special credit schemes, and to concentrate on: (i)
the formulation and implementation of appropri-ate monetary policies; and (ii)
the supervision of the banking sector.
1.  Conduct of Monetary Policy
5.04     The conduct of monetary policy requires a clear program regarding the
goals of monetary control, as well as the use of appropriate monetary instru-
ments to implement this policy, including such classical instruments as the
setting and enforcement of liquidity and reserve requirements, overall
direction of interest rates through such means as the discount rate and the
interbank deposit rate, and influencing growth (or contraction) of money supply
through open market transactions. In Turkey at present, goals of the economic
stabilization program call for a tight monetary policy to combat inflation and
consistent, steady growth rates in money supply to restore economic growth on
a stable path. During the last twelve months in particular, the Central Bank
has moved energetically to gain effective control over monetary developments.
Thus, reserve requirements for commercial banks are now being monitored at
shorter intervals (weekly instead of the previous monthly interval). As noted
in Chapter IV, the interest rate on reserve deposits maintained by commercial
banks with the Central Bank has been gradually reduced. From January 1, 1986,
interest is no longer paid on reserve deposits. As the payment of such
interest by the Central Bank to the commercial banks constituted a substantial
injection of liquidity into the system, this action will lead to a tighter
monetary policy. During 1986 t-he Central Bank will be monitoring the growth of
reserve money, the movement of the money multiplier, as well as the broader
monetary aggregates (M2 and M2X) more closely.
5.05     The Central Bank's role in interest rate policy is exercised princi-
pally through its membership on the Money and Credit Council of which it also
acts as the secretariat. The composition of the Council consists, inter alia,
of the Deputy Prime Minister (Chairman), the Undersecretaries of the Treasury
and Foreign Trade and the State Planning Organization, and the Governor of the
Central Bank. As the economy moves towards freely determined market interest
rates for deposits, the role of the Money and Credit Council will diminish in
importance. The Council also exercises a direct role in setting lending rates
for preferential credit, principally by setting the rediscount interest rates
and the rediscount proportions applicable to the various credit schemes.
5.06     The Central Bank also plans in the near future to start open market
operations, though in order to engage in buying or sel ng of Government
securities in significant amounts, the Central Bank's    ued capital will have
to be substantially expanded from its present level of ii. 25.0 billion.
Finally the Central Bank has started acting as an intermediary in the
interbank market from March 1986, which would provide it another instrument
for influencing the liquidity level in the banking system.



- 30 -
2. Supervision of Banks
5.07     Historically, the Central Bank had played a minor role in the super-
vision of banks. Its primary responsibilities included monitoring liquidity
and reserve requirements and gathering information from the banks through its
modest reporting mechanisms. This information included a statement of con-
dition, a profit and loss statement, and selected memoranda items from which a
handful of ratios were calculated. When concerns were identified, the Board of
Sworn Bank Examiners and the Banking Directorate within the Under-secretariat
of Treasury and Foreign Trade were notified so that they might undertake appro-
priate action.  The Central Bank effort included not more than five individuals
who were-responsible for data collection, data processing, analysis, and other
related duties. In keeping with the Government's intention of redefining the
Central Bank's responsibilities, the Banking Law of April 25, 1985 envisages a
greater role for the Central Bank in the off-site surveillance of banks. This
is a necessary measure to induce public confidence in the banking system.
Unlike in the case of other industries, a bank failure imposes costs not only
on the owners, but also on the depositors, and also disrupts the payments
mechanism, which is the direct responsibility of the Central Bank. Therefore,
in order to strengthen the ability of the Central Bank to supervise the banking
system, important changes have been agreed to be introduced. These are
(i) standardization of accounts of banks, (ii) changes in treatment of non-
performing loans, and (iii) introduction of external audit.
5.08     Standardization of Accounts.  As part of the changes enacted by this
law, banks are required to maintain their accounts, annual balance sheets, and
profit and loss statements according to a uniform chart of accounts. The
Central Bank played a pivotal role in establishing this standardized system of
accounts.- The Uniform Chart of Accounts, as it is known, has been introduced
from January 1, 1986. The chart of accounts when fully implemented will
address several major deficiencies in the existing system of bank supervision.
The Uniform Chart of Accounts, for the first time, establishes a body of defi-
nitions and rules for the classification of accounts. This will ensure a
reasonable basis for the presentation and comparison of financial results.
5.09     Treatment of Non-Performing Loans.  A critical adjunct to the Uniform
Chart of Accounts is the Decree Law on Non-Performing Assets dated December 11,
1985. Under the earlier system, non-performing assets, other than those in
litigation, were determined subjectively by banks without regard to delinquency
status or other criteria. Further, banks could continue to accrue interest
into income for such non-performing assets. Provisions were made to loss
reserves on the basis of the bank's profitability, and bad debts were written-
off at the sole discretion of management. Now, with the passage of the Decree
Law, non-performing status for loans other than current accounts is to be
determined on the basis of delinquency. Upon reaching non-performing status,
the accrual of interest must be discontinued and mandatory minimum provision6s
are to be made to loan loss reserves, thus establishing a linkage between port-
folio quality and the reserve for loan losses which does not exist under the
present system. In Turkey, the current account (or overdraft limit) is widely
used as a vehicle for medium-term financing and for other forms of short-term
credit better suited to other lending instruments. Current account lending
contains an inherent weakness in that the lender is unable to control the



- 31 -
timing and use of drawings against the account. A problem borrower can main-
tain the appearance of performing on his current account by additional drawings
to pay interest and this conceal the true nature of his finances. For current
accounts, the Decree Law on Non-Performing Assets is less specific concerning
the criteria triggering default. Essentially, a declaration of default
remains at the discretion of management.
5.10     External Audit of Banks.  Closely linked to the Uniform Chart of
Accounts is the requirement contained in the Banking Law that annual balance
sheets and profit and loss statements be certified by external auditors. It
has been agreed that the Central Bank will define the criteria by which the
acceptability of auditors will be determined. These criteria are expected to
include certain minimum qualifications related to education, work experience,
and professional reputation. The audits to certify banks' financial statements
are to commence from 1987.
5.11     Off-site Surveillance.  Clearly, the Central Bank's objective in stan-
dardizing accounts and accounting procedures and introducing external audit is
to strengthen the quality of financial reporting by banks and to enable
effective off-site surveillance. To this end, the Central Bank will require
the submission of nearly 50 periodic reports, most quarterly, for the purpose
of supervising each bank's activities. These reports will provide a substan-
tive base of detailed information for analysis and will be used to generate a
standard package of analytical information for each bank. Ratios will be cal-
culated for four primary areas: capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability
and efficiency, and liquidity. Where banks of similar size, lines of business,
and characteristics exist, peer groups and percentile rankings will be esta-
blished for comparative purposes. Transactions involving related entities,
insiders, large borrowers, major firms and large depositors will be monitored.
Based on an analysis of all information, each bank will be assigned a rating as
part of a uniform rating system. The performance of off-site surveillance and
early warning analysis is a critical part of the Central Bank's emerging role
in the system of bank supervision in Turkey. The Central Bank is therefore
committing additional resources for bank supervision including staff and micro-
computers, and the setting up a Division of Bank Surveillance. This division
is to be staffed with approximately ten analysts at inception but may increase
in number as does the Central Bank's role in the supervisory process. The
Central Bank will require technical assistance in bank supervision, and in
upgrading its internal training effort. A technical assistance program with a
total foreign exchange cost of $484,000 has been formulated for this purpose
to be implemented with funding out of the proceed of the proposed loan (see
Annex 16 for details).
B. The Board of Sworn Bank Examiners
5.12     The Board of Sworn Bank Examiners was established by a separate law in
1958 and is the principal bank supervisory body charged with implementing the
provisions of the Banking Law and other laws concerning banking operations.
This responsibility has been carried out through onsite examinations as dis-
tinguished from off-site surveillance, which is the responsibility of the
Central Bank. Examinations are required once during a two-year period although
problem banks and branches are examined more often. The examination process is



- 32 -
designed to determine compliance with law and the financial condition of the
bank. To accomplish this, the Sworn Bank Examiners perform a detailed analysis
of financial transactions and reconstruct a balance sheet which emphasizes the
bank's liquidity. Results are compiled in an examination report which is
formally communicated to the bank. Summary findings are divided into several
categories: general comments, analyais of balance sheet accounts, analysis of
revenues and expenses, financial statistics anid ratios, and violations of law,
accounting principles, and other banking practices.
5.13     The current examination process provides a snapshot of a bank's
condition at a particular moment in time. It is however more important to
anticipate and prevent problems in a dynamic environment and contain risks
within certain optimal parameters. This can be accomplished by focusing on a
"stop down' approach which encourages bank management to adopt the systems,
policies, procedures, and controls which are necessary to appropriately admi-
nister the affairs of the bank on an informed and controlled basis, i.e., with
the help of management information systems. Management information systems in-
clude written policies, procedures, internal controls, audit activities, and
quality control systems, such as an effective program of loan review. By
encouragiug the development of such systems, the bank examiner's role becomes
one of (i) determining that the policy element of the system provides adequate
guidance to management concerning the optimal level of risk and the future
direction of the bank; and, (ii) testing the other elements of the system which
are designed to ensure compliance with policies and procedures and minimize
risk. If any part of the system is determined to be inadequate, the examiner
is obliged to perform more detailed analysis. However, if the system is
determined to be functioning properly, the examiner may forgo detailed
analysis and devote more time to other aspects of the examination. With the
establishment of foreign banks in Turkey many foreign and large local banks
are establishing management information systems along these lines. The
current examination procedures and capabilities of the examiners, however do
not enable the implementation of on site examinations in this manner.
5.14     As a part of the program supported by the loan, the Board of Sworn
Bank Examiners will undertake two actions to implement this concept of onsite
examination. Firstly, the examination manual presently in use will be revised
with the assistance of consultants financed under the loan. Second, a tech-
nical assistance program will be implemented in cooperation with the Office of
The Comptroller of the Currency in the United States for training of bank
examiners, and essential office equipment including computers and related
software will be acquired. The cost of the program as described in Annex 17
is estimated to be $255,000 in foreign currency, which is proposed to be funded
out of the proposed loan.
C. The Commercial Banks: Structure and Performance
5.15     The impact of the reform of the Turkish financial system has been
particularly strong on commercial banks. Entry of new banks has increased
competition, assets have grown rapidly, new financial instruments (e.g.
repurchase agreements and interbank credits), have been introduced and, more
generally, efficiency of intermediation has improved. At the end of 1985,
there were 50 commercial banks operating in Turkey. The twelve public sector
banks accounted for 52 percent of total assets as against 44 percent for the 19



- 33 -
private banks and 4 percent for the group of foreign banks. The number of
foreign banks licensed to operate in Turkey has grown considerably in recent
years as the Government sought to encourage greater competition and the intro-
duction of modern techniques in banking. In practice, however, the foreign
banks concentrate their efforts on a relatively limited clientele of two to
three hundred of the better firms operating in Turkey, and they specialize in
trade finance rather than working capital or project finance. Annexes 13, 14
and 15, provide summarized financial statements of public sector, private
sector and foreign commercial banks in Turkey, which are used in the following
analysis. Some of the main issues facing commercial banks are discussed below.
1.  Interlocking Ownerships                                                -
5.16     Interlocking ownerships between commercial banks and major industrial
conglomerates hlas been commonly recognized as a factor inhibiting competition
among banks in providing services to the corporate sector in Turkey. The
Turkish banks have also been slow in responding to foreign competition. Few
of them have set up the kind of corporate finance services oftered by foreign
banks. Banks affiliated with industrial conglomerates have tried to reduce
competitive pressures by lending to firms within the group. However, the
increasing export orientation of large industrial groups is giving them access
to relatively inexpensive sources of credit from foreign and, increasingly,
from domestic banks specializing in foreign trade finance. Affiliated banks
have therefore had to reduce their margins to their own firms in order to
remain competitive. As a consequence of these competitive forces, as far as
allocation of credit is concerned, the problems caused by the interlocking
ownership of banks and firms are becoming less severe. Furthermore, the
drastic reduction in the share of preferential credit to total credit makes it
less imperative to secure control of banks in order to ensure access to cheap
credit. However, allocation of credit is a relatively minor issue relating to
the interlocking ownership of Turkish banks and corporations. The major pro-
blem is the reluctance of banks to stop extending credit to associated cor-
porations that are no longer creditworthy, or to enforce repayment of existing
loans. The new Banking Law has introduced important safeguards to ensure that
this problem is not further worsened. It has imposed restrictions on the ope-
rations of banks including inter alia, a 20:1 debt/equity ratio limit, a limit
on the maximum exposure to any single customer equal to 10 percent of the
bank's net worth, a limit on the bank's exposure to officials of the bank and
their relatives, and to companies in which the bank has an equity investment.
The next major step would be to introduce limits on the proportion of shares
of a oompany, except of a related financial operation such as a leasing
company, that can be held by banks. The Government has agreed to explore this
course under the loan, though its timing is uncertain as it might have to be
preceded by adequate growth of the equities market.
2. Capital Adequacy
5.17     More stringent capitalization requirements are contained in the new
Banking Law to improve the soundness of the banks and their ability to weather
unexpected loan losses. The deterioration of the equity position of banks was
particularly visible in the late 1970s with paid in capital declining from 3
percent of total assets to 2.5 percent in 1980. Thereafter, the debt/equity
ratios of banks improved substantially from 38.9:1 in 1980 to 15.2:1 in 1984.
This was an-improvement achieved in spite of a six-fold increase in banks'
deposits during that period.



- 34 -
5.18     Despite the increasing capitalization of Turkish banks, paid-in
capital was little more than 6 percent of total assets in 1984. Overdues are
officially estimated at 2.8 percent of assets but are probably higher given the
inconsistency of classification crite::ia among the various institutions. It
seems, however, that the portfolio quality of banks has somewhat improved in
recent years and that banks are increasingly able and willing to set aside
provisions for bad debts subject to adequacy of profits. Provisions have been
raised from 0.3 percent of assets in the late 1970s to an average of 0.6 per-
cent in the period 1981-84 by the private banks. At the same time, the profi-
tability of batiks increased significantly from 1.2 percent of assets in 1983
to 2.3 percent in 1984. Nevertheless, the financial situation of the banks
will continue to be closely monitored by the Central Bank and the Government
to minimize the risk of a major banking crisis, which could jeopardize the
liberalization of the financial system. The systems and technical assistance
provided under the proposed loan will assist in this regard.
3. Large Retail versus Small Urban Banks
5.19     While the overall profitability and soundness of the commercial banks
have improved, performance has been uneven at the individual bank level. Major
banks with a national network of branches have tended to perform less well than
some of the fast growing small urban-based banks. The primary reason for the
differing performance levels of these two groups of banks is the rising costs
of branch banking. The two largest commercial banks accounted for about 45
percent of total bank assets in 1984. They operated one third of the 6,250
bank branches and their staff accounted for 44 percent of total bank employees.
Their profits, however, were only 21 percent of total bank profits while their
overdues represented 62 percent of total overdues.
5.20     Branch banking has become less profitable as depositors shifted from
low yielding sight deposits to higher yielding time deposits. It had been
profitable for banks to operate branches for which the ratio of administrative
and personnel expenses to deposits mobilized was high so long as the proportion
of low-cost household sight deposits was high. However, the shift to time
deposits (see para. 3.08) has raised the average cost of bank deposits drama-
tically without a corresponding increase in average interest income from loans.
The interest spread of banks ' v thus declined by 5 percentage points from 1980
to 1984. Some of the medium sized banks are now responding to these develop-
ments by closing down unprofitable branches. The largest banks, however, are
still reluctant to do so. It would be appropriate for the Government to
encourage an orderly program of closing uneconomic bank branches to reduce the
phenomenon of overbranching which characterizes the Turkish banking system.
With an average population of 7,300 per branch, Turkey has bank branches far
in excess of countries with similar per capita incce'es, which typically have
one bank branch per 20,000 persons.
5.21     The increasing cost of branch banking favors the emergence of smaller,
urban based commercial banks which concentrate their activities on providing
services to the corporate sector. Among the 19 private banks (excluding
foreign bank branches), it is possible to differentiate between a group of six
large retail banks with total assets exceeding TL 200 billion, each and 13
smaller banks. While deposits accounted for 72 percent of the assets of large



- 35 -
banks in 1984, the proportion was only 42 percent for smaller banks which re-
lied more heavily on borrowed funds. In larger banks corporate deposits, which
are cheaper on average than household deposits, represented only about 25 per-
cent of total deposits, with households contributing as much as 65 percent. In
the smaller banks, corporate deposits were relatively more important (45 per-
cent of total deposits) with household deposits representing less than 41 per-
cent of total deposits. While lending activities provided about 81 percent of
the total gross income of large banks, it accounted for 69 percent of income in
smaller banks. Small banks rely more heavily on fees and commissions derived
primarily from financing foreign trade activities. Theo- activities helped
raise the net profits of smaller banks to 4.8 percent of assets in 1984 comr
pared to 1.4 percent for large banks.
4.  Intermediation Costs and Margins
5.22     The margin of intermediation needed to cover the operating costs and
profits of Turkish banks has decreased in recent years but remains very high.
Expressed as a percentage of total assets, the margin of private banks in-
creased steadily from 6.2 percent in 1977 to 10.5 percent in 1980 mainly on
account of increased administrative costs (inclusive of personnel expenses)
which rose from 4.4 percent of assets to 7.6 percent during that period.
During the next three years, administrative costs declined steadily to 4.7 per-
cent of assets in 1983. The gross margin of intermediation of private banks
therefore declined from 10.5 percent in 1980 to 6.9 percent in 1983. In 1984,
it increased significantly to 8.8 percent of assets due in part to adminis-
trative expenses reaching 5.3 percent of assets, but more importantly due to
an increase of net profits from 1.2 percent of assets in 1983 to 2.3 percent
in 1984.
5.23     The ratio of administrative expenses to total bank assets  n Turkey
is high by comparison with banks in other countries. Variation in that ratio
over time reflect more than the relative inefficiency of commercial banks in
Turkey. During the 1977-84 period, the administrative costs of banks grew at
approximately the same rate as the domestic inflation rate. On the other hand,
the assets and deposits of banks grew less rapidly than the inflation rate
until 1980, thus causing a deterioration in the ratio of administrative costs
to total assets. From 1981, however, assets and deposits have grown much more
rapidly than inflation and this led to a significant improvement in the ratio
of administrative costs to total assets.

- 36 -
5.24     The decline in the inflation adjusted value of bank assets and-
deposits in the late 1970s was the result of increasingly negative real deposit
rates as discussed earlier. Conversely, the rapid expansion of bank assets and
deposits in the early 1980s reflects the change in the Government's interest
rate policy with the introduction of significantly positive real rates of
interest on time and savings deposits. The rising administrative costs ratio
up to 1980, followed by a rapid decline therefore reflects variations in the
real value of Bank assets rather than gains or losses in administrative effi-
ciency. As noted in paras 5.32 - 5.38, under the loan, technical assistance
will be provided to help commercial banks to train their staff to improve the
efficiency of the banking system. The high intermediation margin of banks is
striking, since the average interest cost of bank deposits was slightly below
30 percent in 1984, while the average interest earnings of banks on their loans
portfolio was 58 percent-and fees and commissions raised total bank income on
the loan portfolio to 73 percent. However, due to liquidity and reserve
requirements, loans represented only 57 percent of total bank deposits ia 1984.
Based an average deposit cost of 37 percent, the effective interest cost of
loans was over 53 percent (see Annex 7), leaving banks with an interest margin
between the interest earnings and interest costs of loans of only about 5 per-
cent. In fact, this margin was insufficient to cover administrative costs
which, expressed as a percentage of loans were 12.9 percent. However, fees and
commissions allowed banks to show adequate profits. Apart from administrative
costs and reserve and liquidity requirements, another factor pushing up inter-
mediation costs is the relatively large proportion of non-performing loans.
Non-performing loans could be estimated at 10 to 20 percent of the total bank
portfolio based on recorded arrears of 7.4 percent of total loans at end-1984.
5.25     The intermediation costs of Turkish banks are still abnormally high
and ought to be reduced by half to match the efficiency of banks in other
developing countries. As indicated above, banks may have few alternatives but
to close some of their most inefficient branches to reduce their administrative
costs ratios, but progress in this area is likely to be very slow as it
involves significant social costs. Computerization of bank operations is also
likely to help reduce the burden of administrative expenses.
5. Deposit Insurance
5.26     A critical measure necessary to foster confidence in the banking
system, and to deepen the financial sector, is the improvement in the deposit
insurance scheme which was introduced in 1983. The scheme at present provides
coverage of principal amounts upto TL 3.0 million. It has been agreed that
the ceiling will be raised periodically to maintain the level of coverage in
real terms.
D.  The Courts and Collection Procedures
5.27     In the protected environment for the industrial sector which existed
prior to 1980, the banks' losses from bad debts were insignificant. The
gradual removal of the tariff barriers since 1980 caused a dramatic change in
the industrial climate. These changes, combined with real interest rates of
up to 35 percent, devaluation, and reduced demand in the domestic market,
decreased profitability in the industrial sector. The financial problems of
the industrial sector inevitably had their effect on the banking sector in the
form of non-performing loans.



- 37 -
5.28     Confronted by the choice of whether to declare a borrower in default
or to roll-over the loan, banks at the beginning opted for the latter in a
large number of cases. The fiscal and financial regulations did not encourage
banks to declare loans in default as investment incentives on such loans were
cancelled and loans discounted with the Central Bank had to be called and
repaid immediately. Furthermore, banks were not allowed to deduct provisions
for bad debts for tax purposes unless strict conditions were met. Loans were
therefore rescheduled and interest accrued was capitalized. But with the
prevailing high level of real interest rates, this position was not sustainable
for long. As their portfolios problems grew and their liquidity position
deteriorated, the banks had to resort to the courts to recover their overdue
accounts.
5.29     In Turkey, as in most countries, the recovery of overdue debts through
the courts is a-time consuming-affair.  To realize the security in the case of
overdue accounts, it was necessary to secure a court order from the commercial
court and have this order implemented by the court's execution officer. These
procedures usually required numerous court appearances. With the economic dif-
ficulties of the last five years, the number of cases before the court for
recovery of debts increased dramatically. There was a delay of three to four
months between each court hearing on a case which resulted in delays of three
to five years before cases were finally resolved and the property sold to meet
overdue debts. Problems were also being experienced with the operation of the
bankruptcy law. Under the law, a Bankruptcy Administration Committee, respon-
sible for the administration of the bankrupt estate, was elected by a poll of
creditors atteuding the bankruptcy meeting without regard to the amount owed.
At times these meetings were packed with fictitious creditors who elected admi-
nistrators sympathetic to the bankrupt. In many cases the banks were not
represented at creditors meeting as the debtors did not list the banks as
creditors in their report to the court. The elected Administration Committee
refused to take appropriate action to wind up the estate and acted as a facade
behind which the debtor continued to control the estate. The total effect of
these problems with court procedures and bankruptcy administration was that the
collection of overdue debts was virtually unenforceable.
5.30     The Bankers' Association established a commission to review the
situation. The commission submitted a draft bill to the Government in 1984
to amend the Law of Procedure and the Execution and Bankruptcy Law. The
Government accepted the need for action and revisions to the Banking Law,the
Law of Procedure, and Execution and Bankruptcy Law were enacted in February
and May 1985 respectively. A summary of the major amendments is as follows:
(i)    statements submitted by the banks to clients will be deemed prima
facie evidence of debt unless debtors submit a notarized objection
within 30 days of receipt;
(ii)    foreclosure on mortgaged property taken as security for overdraft
facilities will be authorized and certain procedural grounds used by
debtors to delay this process will be removed;
(iii)   a debtor applying for bankruptcy must present a declaration of assets
to the court together with a notarized statement that he has notified
his bank-of his bankruptcy application if the bank is a creditor; and



- 38 -
(iv)    two of the three members of the bankruptcy administration committee
will be appointed based on amounts of receivables and appointment of
the third member will be on the basis of a poll of creditors.
5.31     It will take some time yet to enable the appeals against some of the
legal changes to be completed to permit 8 final evaluation of the effects of
the amendments. Problems in collecting overdue accounts through legal action
will continue to be experienced, however, due to the major increase in the
number of cases before the courts, inadequate staffing of the courts and court
offices, and the many procedural requirements under Turkish Law.  This is a
matter which will require continuous review.
E. The Proposed Banking Institute
5.32     The improvements desired in the commercial banking system necessitate
the introduction of modern banking methods and technology, upgrading and
internationalizing the skills of the existing personnel, and recruitment and
training of new talent. These needs are of such a magnitude that they can be
best addressed by establishing a central training institute which would serve
the entire banking industry. A central training institute would have two very
important advantages. Firstly, it would offer substantial economies of scale.
Secondly and most importantly, the magnitude of the training staff needs will
be reduced to a manageable scale. Accordingly, the Central Bank has taken the
initiative through the Turkish Banks Association, to set up a banking institute
or training school as described below (see Annex 18 for details).
5.33     The proposed banker's training school will have the following
objectives:
-i)    upgrade and internationalize skills in the core banking functions of
credit/marketing, operations/technology, and treasury.
(ii)    introduce the most recent techniques and technologies in banking and
financial markets.
(iii)   upgrade English language skills in the banking system.
(iv)    upgrade training materials and instruction within the Turkish banks.
5.34     The proposed banking school is modelled after the Citibank Training
Center in Athens. The curriculum will be designed by Citibank and some minor
changes will be made to meet the specific needs of the Turkish banking sector.
The official language of the school is to be English. The school will be resi-
dential and it will own its facilities. Citibank will manage the school during
the first five years under a management contract. Citibank's costs will be
fully reimbursed by the bank's association. Citibank will not change any
separate management fees. Although the legal framework has not been worked out
completely yet, the school will be technically owned by the Turkish Banks'
Association through a subsidiary.



- 39 -
5.35     The initial capital expenditures for buildings and grounds will be
provided by the Turkish Banks Association. The Banks' Association will use its
accumulated funds which-are earmarked for educational purposes. In the event
that these funds are insufficient, the Banks' Association will levy fees on
its members to make up the difference. The recurrent costs will be met from
tuition fees from the core programs and seminar participation fees.
5.36     Surveys were undertaken to determine the types of courseb for which
there was the most urgent need in Turkey. Bank consultants were involved in
the conduct of these surveys. The most urgent needs established by the Surveys
are for three core programs which are being offered at the Citibank Training
Center at present: (i) the Core Credit Program, (ii) The Core Bank Operations
Program, and (iii) the Core Treasury Program. In addition, seminars on topics
of interest to senior officers of banks will be offered on subjects such as
international funding, market and industry analysis, technology management,
country risk analysis etc.
5.37     Under the terms of the proposed management contract, Citibank will
provide the director of the school, as well as the teaching staff and coordi-
nators for the core programs, provide teaching materials used in similar
Citibank training programs without copyright charges, and generally manage the
school. The execution of the management contract will be required before the
funds earmarked for this component can be disbursed from the loan.
5.38     Under the proposed loan, an amount of $882,000 will be provide to
finance the foreign exchange component of the capital cost of setting up the
school. The amount will cover the cost of teaching equipment including per-
sonal computers and audio visual equipment, copying and printing equipment,
computer software etc. These goods will be procured by the Government and
leased to the institute on a rent-free basis. The goods will remain the
property of the Government. The establishment of the school will be a
condition for disbursement of this component of the technical assistance
program. Detailed budget estimates for the capital costs and the recurrent
costs of the school are shown in Annex 18, Attachment 3.
CHAPTER VI
DEVELOPING THE MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS
6.01     Money and capital markets have traditionally been a weak link in the
Turkish financial sector. Their growth has been hampered by an inadequate
institutional and regulatory environment and, more recently, by high inflation.
Under these circumstances these markets have been characterized by low activity
level, segmentation, high intermediation costs and occasional speculative
bursts. Recently, however there has been increasing appreciation of the
potential benefits of well organized financial markets. Consequently, their
development has been accorded high priority by the Government, as witnessed by
the institutional and regulatory improvements that are taking place. This
chapter deals with this relatively undeveloped component of the financial sys-
tem by analyzing its segments accordinz to maturity of principal instruments,
as defined in Turkey. Therefore, money markets, which deal with instruments
with maturities of less than two years are distinguished from capital markets,



- 40 -
defined in Turkey to mean markets dealing in instruments with a maturity of
more than two years. Efforts of the main regulatory agency -- the Capital
Market Board to restore confidence after a major collapse in 1982, and changes
in its approach which now appear necessary are discussed in the context of the
sector adjustment program.
A. Money Markets
6.02     Money markets in Turkey encompass instruments as varied as interbank
deposits, CDs, Treasury Bills, commercial paper and bankers' acceptances.
These instruments require a common approach due to their common characteris-
tics, such as their liquidity and their implications for the operation of the
banking system and the conduct of monetary policy.
6.03       A large but completely unregulated market for a variety of private
paper had emerged in Turkey in the late 1970s as a result of the regulated
deposit interest rate structure which produced highly negative real rates in
the high inflation period of the late 1970s. As savings consequently moved
out of bank deposits, smaller banks experiencing liquidity problems devised
ways to circumvent deposit rate ceilings by issuing CDs through brokers at
discounts. These brokers would resell the CDs to the public at par, adding to
the interest by issuing parallel promissory notes in their own names. The
difference between the brokers' buying and selling prices was lent, usually at
very high interest rates, to marginal businesses desperate for cash. The
brokers thus acted as bankers, borrowing and lending money in their own names,
but without being subject to reserve or liquidity requirements or controls.
In the absence of an organized secondary market, liquidity for all the CDs and
other instruments (corporate bonds, stripped bond coupons, IOUs etc.) was
provided only by the brokers' own sight repurchase guarantees. Initially this
line of business proved highly profitable and hundreds of brokerage houses
sprang up, while negotiable CDs, first issued in 1980, reached 10 percent of
bank deposits in 1981. The system collapsed in 1981-82 as brokers could not
collect the loans they had made, and in the absence of a lender of last resort,
could not honor repurchase guarantees. These events have profoundly affected
the attitudes of the authorities towards the money markets and influence the
regulatory framework set up in response to the crisis.
1. Interbank Markets
6.04     The drying up of the market for negotiable CDs in the wake of the
collapse left smaller commercial banks with no alternative but to borrow from
larger and more liquid banks. The interbank market has therefore begun to
develop slowing during the last three years. The growth of the market has been
characterized by considerable fluctuations. Annual turnover in the interbank
market is reported to be still quite low, not exceeding US$2.0 billion. The
market is also highly fragmented, transaction costs are as high as 4-5 percent
and yields vary greatly even for deposits of comparable risk and maturity.
6.05     The most active participants in the interbank market are the foreign
banks operating in Turkey. Some banks are on both sides of the market, being
borrowers or lenders according to their liquidity situation; however there
seems to be a general unidirectional pattern to the interbank market, with



- 41 -
funds flowing from the larger banks with extensive branch networks to foreign
or smaller banks in need of funds. Transactions in the interbank market are
often arranged directly by senior officers of banks as many banks do not have
a specialized treasury function. However, this is gradually changing as the
local banks emulate the treasury techniques of the foreign banks.
6.06     In order to develop the potential of the interbank market fully, the
Government is taking a number of actions. These include the reduction of the
financial transactions tax from its level of 3 percent to 1 percent, which is
helpful, though a complete repeal of the financial transactions tax on inter-
bank deposits-ought to be enacted as soon as possible. The enforcement of the
reserve and liquidity requirements on commercial banks on a weekly basis by the
Central Bank should also provide an impetus to the interbank market. The
Government is also reviewing Article 11 of the Corporate Tax Law, which has
been interpreted by the tax authorities as subjecting the foreign banks to a
withholding tax of 25 percent of the income from interbank deposits thus
creating an impediment to their active participation in the interbank market.
Further, the Central Bank is considering monitoring of reserve and liquidity
requirements of banks on a weekly average basis instead of at the end of the
week, which would give banks greater flexibility to operate in the interbank
market. More importantly, the Central bank has recently entered the inter-
bank market itself, to overcome the traditional reluctance of Turkish banks to
deal directly with each other and as a tool for control of liquidity in the
system.
2. Treasury Securities
6.07     After years of reliance on inflationary financing of deficits by
recourse to the Central Bank, the Government began to issue securities priced
at competitive rates in 1984. Initially these securities were sold "on tap"
through the Central Bank and T.C.Z.B. Due to the attractive yields offered,
it has been possible to place these securities increasingly with non-captive
investors, as shown by the decreasing share of purchases by banks, from 81.4
percent of total issues in 1983 to 45.1 percent in 1984, and by the increasing
share of households from 9.8 percent in 1983 to 21.0 percent in 1984. In May
1985, a market pricing mechanism was introduced through weekly auctions of
six-month, one-year, and two-year securities. Volume of Government bonds out-
standing has thereafter increased rapidly from TL 886 billion as of December
1984, to TL 1,526 billion as of December 1985.
6.08     The introduction of regular weekly auctions of Government securities
is one of the most significant developments in the securities market in recent
years in Turkey, as it provides a market pricing mechanism for a highly
standardized and risk free instrument. The efficiency of the system can be
increased further by (i) allowing settlement at least two days after the
auction, instead of on the same day as at present, to enable distribution by
underwriters; (ii) by offering a range of maturities, three, six, twelve and
twenty four months to suit investor preference.
6.09     The secondary market for Government securities has grown in volume
from TL 35 billion in 1984, wnien trading of any consequence started, to TL 410
billion in 1985. Commercial banks account for 85 percent of the trading, and



- 42 -
ten licensed firms for the rest. Trading is largely on a retail basis, between
financial institutions and their clients, rather than between financial insti-
tutions on a wholesale basis. Trading spreads are reported to be extremely
high, and liquidity limited. Some banks are reported to sell securities to
customers with a repurchase guarantee at spreads of up to 25 percent. This
imperfect but growing secondary market should offer opportunities for intro-
ducing open market operations by the Central Bank as an effective tooL for
monetary policy purposes also.
6.10     Technological. improvements, particularly in telecommunications and in
clearing and settlement of transactions, are essential for the development of
a money market. One factor which restricts the payments system's ability to
handle large volumes of transactions is the present lack of daylight overdraft
privileges. If banks were granted daylight overdraft privileges by the Central
Bank within limits related to a multiple of each bank's capital, depending on
its financial conditions, this constraint could be removed. As a longer term
goal, the introduction of a state-of-the-art electronic clearing and transfer
system could be considered.
B. Capital Markets: Institutional and Regulatory Framework
6.11     Development of sound markets for equities and longer term debt
instruments is essential for improving the efficiency of the Turkish financial
system. It should be recognized that, despite recent improvements, the insti-
tutional framework--particularly the scarcity of reliable corporate financial
information--and the current inflationary environment, are not conducive to
rapid development of the Turkish capital markets. Priority should be given to
improving the institutional framework and the quality of financial information.
After this is achieved to a satisfactory degree, a range of measures to improve
supply of, and demand for, securities can be adopted. Pending these improve-
ments, and stabilization of macro-economic conditions, it is envisaged that
markets for longer term securities will develop more slowly than markets for
short-term Government and bank instruments.
1. The Capital Market Board
6,12     The Capital Market Board (CMB) has main responsibility for the
regulation and supervision of the primary and secondary markets for securities.
Its main duties include:
(a)    Supervision of corporations which have made public offerings of
securities or have at least 100 shareholders.
(b)    Supervision and regulation of investment companies, mutual funds and
securities market intermediaries, including securities firms
and--limited to their securities operations-banks.
(c)    Review and approval of all public offering of corporate securities
and negotiable instruments, with the exception of bank instruments.



- 43 '
6.13     CMB has adopted the view that only instruments previously typified in
the Law or in official regulations qualify for approval. Accordingly, the
Board interprets its role as including the design and development of new finan-
cial papers, a role which could more appropriately be fulfilled by the market.
The Board "approves" public offerings, depending not just on the applicant's
compliance with financial disclosure and other legal requirements, but also on
a judgment on the investment merits of securities. This approach of the Board
is risky, because: (i) it creates an indirect CMB responsibility -- at least a
moral one -- for losses suffered by investors who bought "approved" issues;
(ii) by encouraging investors to rely on the Board's judgment on the merits and
safety of securities, it may hamper the development of an independent market
capability to appraise and price securities; (iii) from a practical point of
view, a thorough screening of all new issues would require a huge CMB staff.
The fact that CMB's review is currently based on unaudited data adds to the
above reasons for concern.
6.14     Considering its short existence, CMB does have a creditable record of
restoring some order and confidence to the securities markets. These positive
results, however, have often been achieved by imposing restrictions on permis-
sible instruments and on the operations of intermediaries which, while suitable
to the emergency situation in which CMB began its activity, might constrain the
future development of the market. The Government intends to reduce CMB inter-
ference with market forces in such areas as detailed regulation and specifi-
cation of permissible securities and related activities -- including minimum
and maximum maturities, underwriting fees, and pricing. The Board would in
future concentrate on enforcing disclosure and audit requirements for secu-
rities issuers, with a view to ultimately permitting investors and interme-
diaries to assess the quality of securities on the basis of reliable
information. Under the loan it has been agreed that independent auditing of
companies registering for public offerings or seeking listing in the new Stock
Exchange will be introduced from 1987, in accordance with the same time frame
as introduced for banks.
6.15     The need for training is substantial for both private aud public
sector entities operating in the capital markets. GMB has a well established
training program for its entry and mid-level personnel, which is funded by OECD
and implemented at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Under
the proposed loan, it is proposed to supplement the OECD program by funding the
acquisition of teaching equipment for a training center at CMB, and to provide
training fellowships for CMB staff, and for advisory services of consultants at
a foreign exchange cost of $275,000 (see Annex 19 for details). Beneficiaries
of the training facilities will also include personnel of the securities
trading firms.
2. Intermediaries and Institutional Investors
6.16     Intermediation in the primary and secondary markets for longer term
securities is carried out by ten licensed securities firms and a limited
number of commercial banks. There is some specialization by instruments,
with securities firms dominating corporate bond underwriting and trading,
and commercial banks being more active in public sector securities. The
small equity market is about evenly split between securities firms and banks.



- 44 -
6.17     Securities firms have the advantage of more specialized expertise, but
their contribution to the financial markets is limited by (a) their being often
related to large business groups, in whose securities they se- ialize;
(b) legal limitations prohibiting them from entering repurchase agreements,
trading bank instruments and managing mutual funds; (c) scarcity of capital
and lack of a liquidity mechanism. The CMB has appropriately encouraged the
establishment of independent firms, four of which have been recently licensed.
The next step should be to establish strict solvency and liquidity ratios, as
well as disclosure and reporting standards, and audit requirements. A
flexible mechanism to accommodate the daily liquidity needs of securities
firms should be established through a reform of the Central Bank's Securities
Fund, whose financing is currently available only in distress situations.
6.18     Commercial and development banks are currently allowed a broader range
of capital market activities than securities firms, broad enough to classify
them as potential universal banks. In practice, most Turkish banks hold equity
investments in affiliate companies, but have not been active in turning over
these holdings and in promoting securities markets. Recently, however, more
commercial banks have started securities departments, and a few are now invol-
ved in limited underwriting and trading of corporate equities and bonds, in
addition to a relatively large activity in public sector securities. Encou-
raging banks to progressively divest their relatively large portfolios of
equities of nou-financial firms, which amount to about 1/3 of the net worth of
the banking system, would considerably contribute to increasing the supply of
equities in the open markets.
6.19     The Turkish insurance industry has suffered from years of high in-
flation which have undermined demand for insurance products.  Life insurance
in force in 1983 was only about 0.7 percent of GNP in Turkey, as compared to 7
percent in Thailand, 36 percent in Korea, 156 percent in the USA, 300 percent
in Japan. Total assets of the Turkish insurance industry amounted to only
TL 114 billion in 1983. Of these, securities accounted for 31.6 percent (6.8
percent equities and 24.8 percent bonds, mostly government bonds). Further-
more, portfolio management by insurance firms has often been oriented towards
investment in affiliated or otherwise related companies, which probably
accounts for an overall unsatisfactory return on earning assets. However, the
introduction in 1985 of tax deductibility of insurance premia has led to subs-
tantial increases in the assets managed by insurance companies, with corres-
ponding increases in their securities investments. A new insurance law under
preparation, providing for higher capital requirements for insurance companies
and a more marked separation of their activities from those of other financial
institutions, should also contribute to the development of the industry.
6.20     Social Security entities include four public sector and about sixty
(mostly bank-related) private pension funds. Their total assets exceeded
TL 900 billion at end of 1984, with only 14 percent of assets invested in secu-
rities, mostly low-yield bonds of the State Investment Bank, which the Social
Security System is required to purchase.  Equity holdings of private pension
funds are mostly in related companies, and control-oriented. Under the loan,
a review of the investment guidelines of the Social Security System to orient
them increasingly towards suitable, long-term corporate bonds and equities --
but limited to those on which adequate financial information exists -- will be
carried out.

6.22     Corporate Equities.  In the past three years, public offerings of
equities have substantially exceeded, in real terms, the levels achieved in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. This was partly due to a more favorable market
environment, stimulated by a 1983 Asset Revaluation Law which, causing expec-
tations of stock dividends, contributed to higher share prices. Other factors
believed to have encouraged new share issues are the decline, after 1982, of
the corporate bond market which, although partly reversed in 1985, has deprived
corporations of an attractive financing tool; and the dividend payout require-
ments introduced by the CMB which, limiting the ability of corporations to
retain earnings, have forced them to resort increasingly to new offerings of
equities in 1985. The Government took a number of steps to favor the develop-
ment of the equity market. These include: (a) complete repeal of taxation of
dividends; (b) repeal of taxation of the premium of newly issued shares over
par value; and (c) opening of a new Istanbul Stock Exchange. These measures
should contribute to creating an environment more conducive to the development
of equity markets. However, this is likely to be a slow process, as several
constraints remain, which affect both the supply of, and the demand for
securities in the open markets.
6.23     On the supply side, the main constraints relate to the relative cost
of equity versus debt financing, and to concentration of equity ownership.
Despite extremely high interest rates in both nominal and real terms, the tax
deductibility of interest costs contributes to making the after-tax cost of
debt financing substantially lower than the cost of equity. This is particu-
larly evident in the periods of high inflation, when the deduction of the
nominal -- as opposed to real -- interest paid results in a tax deduction of a
part of the principal as well. The reduction of inflation should therefore
reduce the disparity between the costs of borrowing and of equity financing,
thus boosting equity issues. Another potentially major development which might
increase the supply of securities to the open market is the Government's plan
for selective privatization of SEEs. While the privatization program has not
yet begun, the size of the SEEs capital base suggests that even a partial



- 46 -
privatization could increase supply significantly.  A wider distribution of
equity ownership could be achieved by placing limits on the proportion of
shares of a company that can be held by a bank and encouraging the opening up
of larger closely held companies. To this end, the tax exemptions for divi-
dends and capital gains should, in the future, be limited to equities of "open"
corporations.
6.24     On the demand side, the gradual decline in the inflation rate would
improve the attractiveness of equity holding from the saver's point of view
also. After the favorable tax reforms introduced in 1985, there should be no
need for further tax incentives for investment in equities. The main inter-
ventions should be to introduce compulsory external audit of widely held corpo-
rations, since lack of transparency in corporate accounts and of consolidated
group financial statements have reportedly facilitated practices such as
shifting of profits, which have discouraged the public from investing in
shares.
6.25     Corporate Bonds.  The corporate bond market grew very fast in the late
1970s, as a tool for both borrowers and investors to bypass the high interme-
diation costs of the banking system. Bond issues have however declined after
1980, partly because of the collapse in 1981-82 of many bond dealers and partly
because of increasing competition from time deposits and Government paper, now
carrying mote attractive yields than in the past. This trend has been partly
reversed in 1985, due to the relaxation of restrictions on the coupon rates
that could be offered, which previously limited the competitiveness of bonds.
Consequently, new issues increased from TL 16.0 billion in 1983 to TL 32.0 bil-
lion in 1985. All bonds issued thus far have either been straight unsecured
debentures or, more rarely, guaranteed by banks. Mortgage instruments, colla-
teralized by real estate. equipment or other real assets, have not been issued
in Turkey, though they should be suitable to a market in which inadequate
financial information adds to the riskiness of unsecured instruments.
6.26     By CMB regulation, minimum and maximum maturities of corporate bonds
are set at two and seven years. In practice, most recent issues have had 2-3
year maturities, with the two year minimum maturity being a serious constraint,
especially in the absence of a sufficiently liquid secondary market. Issuing
prices and coupon yields are set by the Central Bank according to a formula
which determines a minimum and maximum yield to maturity. This formula had
seriously restricted the competitiveness of bonds in 1983-84 but its relaxation
in 1985 has permitted a better adaptation of bond yields to market conditions.
All-in cost to issuers of bonds have recently averaged 66-68 percent, well
below the cost of bank loans, while net yields to individual investors have
been 56-58 percent. If allowed to better adapt to market conditions, particu-
larly through repeal of maturity restrictions, bonds could be an attractive
instruments to borrowers and investors alike. Under the proposed loan, it has
been agreed that the detailed controls exercised by CMB in review and approval
of corporate bond issues will be relaxed.
6.27     Government revenue sharing instruments, essentially tax free and with
maturities of 3-5 years, have been first issued in 1984-85 to finance major
infrastructural projects. This sharing in a project's revenues, rather than



- 47 -
paying interest, makes them particularly attractive to orthodox Islamic inves-
tors. CMB is studying the introduction of similar instruments for the private
sector. These instruments would be particularly useful to meet funding needs
of leasing companies, some of which are being established in a regulatory
environment which has been improved by the enactment of leasing legislation in
1985.
2. Secondary Markets
6.28     In the past, the lack of efficient secondary capital markets and thus
of liquidity has limited the potential for developing longer term financial
instruments in TurKey. Trading in corporate equities and bonds has mostly
occurred over-the-counter, with the old and obsolete Istanbul Stock Exchange
being practically inactive. Even in the over-the-counter market, however,
transaction volume has been extremely low, amounting in January-November 1985-
to TL 2.5 billion for shares, TL 46.1 billion for corporate bonds and TlI 74.5
billion for revenue sharing bonds. Furthermore, the market has been charac-
terized by fragmentation, lack of transparency and high intermediation costs,
with trading spreads as high as 10-20 percent for equities. In the bond
markets, dealers have mostly confined themselves to making markets in the secu-
rities they had underwritten, trading only with their own clients and never
with other dealers.
6.29     The opening of the new Istanbul Stock Exchange, at the beginning of
1985, should contribute to improved transparency and efficiency of both the
equity and bond markets. The system of dealers/market-makers adopted by the
new exchange as opposed to the old one based on agents - should provide listed
securities with a certain degree of liquidity through market-making services.
CHAPTER VII
DEVELOPING THE ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT PROFESSIONS
7.01.    The existence of a well developed accounting and audit profession,
applying internationally accepted accounting standards is practically a pre-
condition for the development of a modern financial system. However, there is
as yet no professional organization for accountants in Turkey. The accounting
function in the central and local Governments, State Economic Enterprises (SEE)
and medium and large-scale private industrial and commercial firms is usually
controlled by university graduates from the business, economic and law facul-
ties. Numerous attempts have been made in the past to establish standards for
the accounting profession in Turkey, but were blocked by interests now active
in accounting and auditing professions. This chapter reviews the situation of
the accounting and audit professions, the effect of poor accounting standards
and the development of the profession under the proposed adjustment program,
now that a legal enactment to establish a body for the development of the
accounting profession has been finally enacted in December 1985.
A. The Present Situation
7.02     Accounting.  The Government accounting systems are in need of improve-
ments.  Following a study by the IMF in 1978, a comprehensive Government ac-
counting scheme was proposed for the modernization of the system. The scheme



- 48 -
has not been implemented as successive Governments have been too busy coping
with more pressing financial and economic matters. The local Government
accounting systems also have major deficiencies and are urgently in need of
modernization. Similarly, most SEEs have financial accounting systems designed
to produce financial reports required by Government budgeting regulations,
rather than to provide financial information to analyze the operations of the
enterprise meaningfully. Costing and management accounting in SEEs is practi-
cally nonexistent at present. In some of the private Turkish holding companies
and larger manufacturing companies, modern financial and management accounting
systems have been developed and are operating satisfactorily. These cases,
however, are the exception. In private industry in general, accounting is
limited to control of assets and liabilities and to the production of annual
income statements and balance sheets, mainly to meet the requirement of the tax
laws. The accounting standards used in these accounts are those required by
the tax code aud not in accordance with generally accepted accounting princi-
ples. The accounts are usually finalized well after the end of the fiscal
year. Management accounting is generally limited to ad-hoc costing for pricing
purposes.
7.03     Auditing.  Within the Ministry of Finance, there are three groups of
auditors with about 400 staff consisting of Finance Inspectors, Tax Auditors
and Sworn Bank Examiners. The Finance Inspectors are mainly responsible for
auditing the accounts of Government departments; Tax Auditors are responsible
for auditing tax returns; and Sworn Bank Examiners undertake on-site audit of
state, commercial and development banks to ensure compliance with Government
and Central Bank regulations. In addition, the High Control Board attached to
the Prime Minister's Office, with a staff of about 180 auditors, is responsible
for auditing SEEs. The public sector auditors are competent, but their number
is limited; the result is that audits are not completed within a reasonable
time-frame and that their examination is often, by necessity, cursory. Empha-
sis is largely on compliance with Government regulations, and there is not
much analysis of the financial management and performance of the entity being
audited.
7.04     Private companies with a wide shareholder base are required under the
Commercial Code to appoint auditors to inspect their books of accounts, report
any irregularity to management and certify the company's accounts. No profes-
sional qtralification is required for persons appointed as auditors. A number
of the international accounting firms have associated firms operating in
Turkey. These firms have two or three partners who have qualified abroad but
the major part of their staff consist of recent university graduates without
auditing experience. A substantial part of these firms' audit practice con-
sists of auditing subsidiaries or associated companies of international firms.
In recent years there has been an increase in demand for their audit services
from Turkish industrialists and banks which wish to borrow abroad. There are
also a number of Turkish accountants providing services to industry, but the
major emphasis of their work is related to the completion of accounts for tax
purposes.



^ 49 -
B.  Needs for Development of the Profession
7.05     Modernization of the central and local Government accounting systems
is urgently required to improve Government's budgetary control. Improvements
in SEE accounting systems, particularly in the field of management accounting
and costing, are an essential requirement of the Government's SEE reform stra-
tegy. A modern costing system is also important for establishing pricing
structures for SEEs' products, deciding on product mix and in reaching "make or
buy" decisions, etc. A competent audit of SEEs covering financial management
and performance in addition to the audit of accounts is important to provide an
independent evaluation to the Government on the operational efficiency of these
enterprises.
7.06     Major improvement in the accounting systems, with particular emphasis
on management accounting, costing and auditing, are also required in the pri-
vate industrial and commercial sectors. Turkish industry, which up to 1980 was
heavily protected, has been gradually undergoing restructuring. A rapid in-
crease in industrial productivity is essential to enable these firms to be com-
petitive in the new economic environment. A reliable management accounting
system is an important factor in achieving this objective. In addition, given
the current high intermediation costs of the banking system, there is an urgent
need to develop the securities markets in Turkey. The lack of adequate
accounting standards, independent qualified auditors and disclosure require-
ments has been one of the major factors in severely limiting the development of
an equity and bond market for financing industrial development.
7.07     Better accounting standards are also essential to enable the Govern-
ment to levy and collect tax. Public auditing would reduce the burden on tax
inspectors in reviewing the tax returns of well organized industries as the
inspectors could rely on a sample check of each accounting firms' returns to
evaluate their work. This reduction in work load would enable inspectors to
direct their attention to other areas particularly the commercial and profes-
sional sectors where tax evasion is endemic. With the recent introduction of
a value-added tax, the upgrading of accounting and audit procedures has become
urgent to ensure adequate collection of this tax.
C. Proposed Council for Sworn Financial Advisors
7.08     The Government of Turkey has made numerous efforts during the past
three decades to enact a law for the control and development of the accounting
profession to improve accounting and auditing practices in Turkey. Legislation
has been submitted to Parliament several times but failed to secure approval
due to opposition from various groups protecting their own parochial interests.
In December 1985, however, an act was passed setting up the legal framework for
an Council for " Sworn Financial Advisors" (SFA). The term "Sworn Financial
Advisor" was used in the law as the Turkish term for accountant is now gene-
rally used to refer to bookkeepers. Under the law, the Government is
authorized to appoint an initial 20-member council for a 3-year period to be
responsible for the development and control of the accounting profession.
Under the loan, it has been agreed that the council would be appointed at the
earliest, in any event prior to tranche release review, with appropriate com-
position. The primary objective of the law is to increase the collection of



- 50 -
tax by improving the standard of accounting. The mandate of the council, how-
ever, is broad enough to enable it to undertake a general development of the
accounting and audit profession. The law, (i) sets forth in general terms the
scope of work of SFAs; (ii) authorizes the tax authorities to accept as
audited, tax returns certified by SFAs while reserving the tax authorities
right to reexamine these returns; and (iii) empowers the Council of Ministers
to issue decrees setting forth regulations for the organization, adminis-
tration and control of Chambers of Sworn Financial Advisors.
7.09     To enable the council to develop proposals for the establishment of a
professional organization and for the development of the professional, tech-
nical assistance will be funded under the proposed loan in the following
fields:
(i)    design of the organiiation's legal charter, by-laws and establishment
of an appropriate administration;
(ii)    assessment of the potential number of accountants required during the
next ten years and appropriate accounting streams (e.g. public
auditors, financial accountants, management accountants and public
service accountants);
(iii)   establishment of educational standards for admisaions of student
members, selection of appropriate professional subjects for each
stream of accounting, establishment of appropriate curriculums;
(iv)    organization of professional examinations, establishment of practical
experience requirements for admission of mature and student candidates
to full membership.
(v)    preparation of generally accepted accounting and auditing standards
for Turkey; and
(vi)    organization of seminars to promote the accounting profession in
Turkey.
7.10     In addition, finance will be provided under the loan to cover the
foreign exchange cost of the council's office equipment, travel and subsis-
tence allowances for members of the council and the establishment of a library.
Annex 20 summarizes the technical assistance program for the council.
CHAPTER VIII
THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Rationale and Objectives
8.01     The proposed loan has originated from the Bank's economic and sector
work in Turkey during the last five years particularly concerning issues in
the financial sector. The role of the financial sector in Turkey's develop-
ment, its performance and prospects, and the policy and institutional con-
straints which inhibit its development have been under continuous discussion



- 51 -
between the Bank and the Government since 1983.  As a result of this close dia-
logue, the Government has already undertaken several important reform measures.
These includes: (i) liberalization of deposit rates; (ii) reduction in the
extent of selective credit; (iii) a gradual rise in selective credit interest
rates; (iv) reduction in financial transactions tax; (v) reduction in reserve
and liquidity requirements; (vi) substantial overhaul of banking legislation;
and (vii) establishment of the Capital Market Board. These measures, while
important, will not complete the process of financial sector reform. It has
always been recognized that the process of financial sector reform would have
to continue for several years for the impact of the reform measures to be
evident at the institutional level. The proposed loan would be in support of
a multi-year program of further policy and institutional measures as set out
in the Letter of Financial Sector Policies.
B. Loan Components
8.02     The proposed loan of $300 million will be made to the Government at
the Bank's normal variable interest rate. The loan has two components: (a) the
sector policies reform component, and (b) the technical assistance component.
(a)    Sector Policies Reform Components:  This component of $297.0 million
is in support of the new policy actions envisaged in the financial sector
during 1986 and during the medium-term, as committed by the Government in the
Statement of Financial Sector Policies. The major objectives of the sector
policies reform program are to:
Ci)    improve the efficiency of the resource mobilization and allocation
process through support for creating an appropriate interest rate
structure and adjustment mechanisms;
(ii)    reduce the extent of implied subsidies on selective credit to
productive sectors;
(iii)   rationalize the tax treatment of financial instruments;
(iv)    strengthen the capacity of the Central Bank to monitor the operation
of banks;
(v)    support the introduction of standardized accounting and external
audit of banks;
(vi)    encourage measures to reduce the intermediation costs of commercial
banks;
(vii)   strengthen the institutional framework for the development,
supervision and regulation of primary and secondary securities
markets;
(viii)  assist the development and functioning of interbank and money markets;
(ix)    stimulate the development of the equity markets;



- 52 -
(x)    support the development of the accounting and audit professions; and
(xi)    initiate the introduction of new financial services.
(b)    Technical Assistance Component:
8.03     This component of $3.0 million, will benefit six agencies involved in
the implementation of financial sector reforms -- the Treasury, the Central
Bank, the Board of Sworn Bank Examiners, the Capital Market Board, the
Proposed Council for Sworn Financial Advisors, and the commercial banks. The
overall program includes the provision of about 55 staff months of consultancy
services. Recruitment of consultants will be as per Bank guidelines. In
addition, office equipment and training of selected staff of the beneficiary
institutions at suitable institutions abroad will be financed. The technical
assistance programs for the beneficiary agencies are detailed in Annexes
16-20.  An overview of the costs is provided in Annex 21.   Implementation
schedules are shown in Annex 22.    About 65 percent of the foreign exchange
costs will be funded under this loan component. The local currency costs as
well as the remaining foreign exchange costs will be borne by the beneficiary
agencies. A summary of the foreign exchange costs which will be funded out of
proposed loan is shown below:

C. Utilization
8.04     The proposed loan would finance about 1.3 percent of Turkey's total
merchandise imports over the disbursement period (Sept-1986 to Sept-1988). The
proposed loan would finance all goods to be imported into Turkey except for
goods financed by other sources and a specific list of excluded items such as
military or para-military items and luxury goods such as tobacco, precious
stones and jewelry, gold, and nuclear reactors and parts.
D.  Procurement, Disbursement and Administration
8.05     The Undersecretariat for Treasury and Foreign Trade and the Central
Bank will have primary responsibility for administering the proposed loan.



- 53 -
Procurement of goods costing $10 million or more will be through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Certain commonly traded commodities may be purchased through price quotations
from organized international commodity markets. All contracts of lesser value
would be awarded through normal trade channels on the basis of normal procure-
ment procedures of the public and private sector firms concerned. Procurement
of computer hardware/software will be on the basis of obtaining at least three
price quotations from eligible suppliers as per Bank guidelines or through
direct negotiations with the original manufacturer where compatibility with
existing equipment is necessary. Firms in Turkey have adequate choice of
international suppliers to ensure reasonable availability and price.
8.06     Consultancy services to be obtained for the various technical assist-
ance components will be obtained as per the Bank's Guidelines for Recruitment
of CQnsultants, except in the case of the Bankers' Training Institute, for
which a management contract (which is not being financed by the Bank) with
Citibank is expected to be concluded shortly. Procurement of other items such
as office equipment will be as per the procurement procedure above.
8.07     To simplify disbursement, only invoices with a minimum value of
$50,000 equivalent would be eligible for disbursement.  The loan would be
disbursed against only foreign expenditures. In order to permit a smooth flow
of imports, retroactive financing of upto $30 million has been provided for.
In order to ensure that Turkey will have ready access to foreign exchange, a
special account would be established in the Central Bank of Turkey to which
the World Bank would make an initial deposit of up to $45 million. Payment
requests would be made against full documentation except for those against
contracts valued up to $100,000 equivalent relating to the technical
assistance of the project, and contracts valued up to $3,000,000 equivalent
for the policy component, where statements of expenditure (SOEs) would be
authorized. The special account would be replenished against withdrawal
applications at monthly intervals or as appropriate when the undisbursed
balance of the account falls below $25 million. The closing date for
disbursement will be September 30, 1989. It is expected that the entire
amount of Bank financing for the technical assistance component will be
disbursed by this date.
E. Monitoring and Tranche Release
8.08     Monitoring of performance involves essentially three complementary
and inter-related activities. Monitoring of the implementation of the
Government's macro-economic program which is an ongoing activity as a part of
the Bank's economic dialogue and reporting arrangements; monitoring the
implementation of the financial sector adjustment program as a whole; and the
monitoring of progress on specific agreed reform actions as a condition of
tranche release. The spzcific conditions proposed for release of the second
tranche of $100 million will be achievement of satisf.. tory progress on the
following:
(a)    Actions to ensure adequate progress in implementing the 1986 economic
program including inflation control and adoption of a 1987 economic
program, compatible in terms of its strategy and its targets, with
the Government's adjustment program (para 2.14);



- 54 -
(b)    Achievement of positive real. interest rates, determined according to
a methodology satisfactory to the Bank, on preferential credit to the
productive sectors i.e. agriculture, industry, mining, trade,
transport and tourism (para 4.14);
(c)   -Satisfactory completion of the review to determine the need for
continuation of and form of FERIS (para 4.20);
(d)    Introduction of compulsGry external audit of the annual financial
statements of commercial banks commencing from the fiscal year 1987
(para 5.10);
(e)    Introduction of compulsory external audit of annual financial
statements of corporations issuing securities by public issue, or
seeking listing of their securities on the Istanbul Stock Exchange
commencing from the fiscal year 1987 (para 6.14);
(f)    Appointment of Council for Sworn Financial Advisors with appropriate
composition and conclusion of satisfactory arrangements for technical
assistance for the council (para 7.08);
(g)    Actions to revise the examination manual used by the Board of the
Sworn Bank Auditors (para 5.14);
(h)    Actions to carry out a study and to prepare an implementation program
for setting up a system of export credit and insurance (para 2.10).
Disbursement for the technical assistance component would not be
subject to the tranche release conditions.
F. Justification and Risks
1. Justification
8.09     A more efficient financial sector will increase the Governments'
ability to manage the economy and further the success of the economic adjust-
ment program by increasing resource mobilization and improving resource
allocation mechanisms. Increased efficiency of the financial sector will thus
enhance growth, both by increasing savings and by channelling them to higher
yielding investments. In particular, by developing a greater variety of finan-
cial instruments, financial sector reform will enable financing of investments
more economically, thus contributing to a revival of private investment. The
improvement in the supervision and surveillance of the banking system by the
Central Bank and the Board of Sworn Bank Examiners will increase confidence in
the Banking system, which should induce its further growth.
8.10     The loan will also address the development of the accounting and audit
professions, which is one of the most glaring gaps in the financial system in
Turkey. The development of the profession and improved accounting systems will
in the long-run improve the Government's budgetary control, improve monitoring
of SEE performance and tax collection. In the private sector, efforts at
productivity improvement and restructuring will be facilitated. Finally, the
development of the money and capital markets, which is a major objective in the
sector reform programs, will be helped.



- 55 -
2. Risks
8.11     The reforms sought in the sector policies related to interest rates
and selective credit policies could be rendered more difficult by failure in
attaining macro-economic policy objectives; most critical among which is the
reduction of inflation. The outlook for inflation, which acts as a major
impediment to stable growth in the financial sector, is more positive than at
any time in the last two years. Since the reemergence of high inflation in
1984, policies have been followed to curtail inflationary pressures, and they
appear to be working. During the course of 1986 and 1987 it will become clear
whether stabilization has finally taken a firm hold and inflationary expecta-
tions are defeated. Until then, uncertaircy about the impact of inflation on
the financial sector will, by necessityv  continue to prevail.
8.12     Improvements in the functioning of the banking system have a higher
probability of being realized, as the pressure of competition from new banks
will provide a considerable impetus. The progress made in setting up the
Central Bank's surveillance department, the thoroughness of the consultants'
study in setting out the procedures, and the positive response of the banks' to
the new procedures and mechanisms, indicate a low risk in this area. However,
the financial health of the corporate sector is critical to improvements in
the banking systems. This aspect is also linked to progress in control of
inflation) as corporation distress will be further worsened by high real
interest rates, and in turn affect the viability of banks.
8.13     Risks in regard to the capital market program relates to the limited
impact which the development program can achieve while inflation is high and
the return which equity holders can obtain is unlikely to match the interest
rates on fixed-term deposits. However, progress to date is encouraging in that
there a strong, though somewhat thin demand for equities and the corporate
bond market is growing rapidly. While the resistance to the introduction of
compulsory external audit is to be expected, there is a growing awareness of
the necessity of properly audited accounts as Turkish firms are entering into
joint ventures with foreign companies. The above risks, though considerable,
do not appear to be of a magnitude which could jeopardize the continuation of
the financial sector adjustment program undertaken by the Government.
CHAPTER IX
RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01     The Government has committed itself to carrying out the following
actions as recorded in the Statement of Financial Sector Policies:
(i)    Positive rates on preferential credits to productive sectors would be
achieved by end of 1986 as already stated under SAL IV, and would be
maintained thereafter (para 4.14).
(ii)    A reference rate mechanism would be developed in order to help the
Government to monitor and adjust preferential credit interest rates,
thereby reducing and eliminating the implied subsidies on
preferential credit (para 4.22).



- 56 -
(iii)   Interest rates mechanisms especially for medium and long term
rediscounted loans designed to reduce interest rate risk to both
borrowers and lenders would be introduced (para 3.11).

to the end of 1986 (para 4.20).
(v)    Reserve requirements for banks would be progressively reduced to 15.
percent, thus decreasing the marginal cost of loanable funds in the
banking system (para 4.11).
(vi)    Taxation of income from holdings of Government bonds would be
introduced to decrease the after-tax return to banks and other
financial institutional holders, thus inducing the use of funds for
lending (para 4.13).
(vii)   Surcharge on non-export related borrowing in foreign currency would
be introduced to control undue increase in short-term foreign
liabilities of the private sector and to bring foreign currency
borrowing costs more in line with local costs (para 4.09).
(viii)  Standardization of accounts of commercial banks would be enforced
from 1986 (para 5.08).
(ix)    Legal enactment to set up the Board of Sworn Financial Advisors would
be completed and Audit Commission with appropriate composition to be
set up (para 7.08).
(x)    Independent external audit of banks would be enforced from 1987.
List of acceptable auditors to be prepared and issued by June 1987
(para 5.10).
(xi)    The capability of the Central Bank to monitor the operations of
commercial banks on an off-site basis would be strengthened by
setting up an adequately staffed surveillance department (para 5.11).
(xii)   Commercial banks would be permitted to deduct provisions for doubtful
debts, subject to limits to be set by the Government (para 5.09).
(xiii)  The examination manual used by the Board of SBEs would be revised to

maximum and minimum maturities etc. would be relaxed in the case of
corporations with audited accounts (pars 6.14).



- 57 -
(xvi)   issue of commercial paper and short term promissory notes would be
encouraged to provide an alternative means of raising resources for
corporation. Supply of equities in the market would be stimulated by
providing tax incentives to corporations to offer equities to the
public subject to their accounts being audited (paras 6.22, 6.26).
(xvii)  Demand for equities would be stimulated by reviewing the investment
policies of institutional investors (para 6.20).
(xviii) Demand for equity holding by individuals would be stimulated by
exempting dividend income and capital gains from personal taxation
(para 6.22).
(xix)   Financial transactions tax on interbank transactions would be reduced
or abolished (para 6.06).
(xx)    Withholding tax on interbank deposits held by foreign banks would be
reviewed with a view to its being reduced or eliminated (para 6.06).

Mr. A. W. Clausen
President
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Developmeat
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C.
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Clausen:
The Turkish Government has now completed the sixth year of the
Government's program for restructuring the economy. The adjustment program
has helped Turkey to expand exports and to improve its external balance.
Under the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan, the Government will continue to
encourage liberalization of the economy, develop industry along lines of
comparative advantage and promote growth of exports. We have also beguu to
widen the adjustment process by emphasizing policy and institutional reforms
at the sectoral level.
The Government has given a high priority to reforms in the financial
sector, within a medium-term framework covering the next five years. The
attached Statement of Financial Sector Policies describes the main elements in
the Government's program for financial sector reform relating to sector
policies, the banking system and the development of capital markets. It
encompasses policy and institutional measures either under way or those to be
undertaken in 1986 and 1987. The Government is committed to carry out the
financial sector reform program as described in the attachments. As always,
the Government would welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters with the
World Bank. I am writing to you at this time to request a Finaucial Sector
Adjustment Loan in the amount of $300 million to assist in the financing of
the Government's program of financial sector reform.
Yours sincerely,
/s/ Kaya Erdem
Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of State

Attachment I
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES - 1986
Introduction
1.       The Government recognizes that an important determinant of the
success of the economic reform program begun in January 1980 will be the
effectiveness of changes being introduced in the financial system under the
reform program, and especially during the last two years. Efficient
functioning of the financial system is very closely linked with macro-economic
policies followed by the Government to address the major issues in the
readjustment program.  The overall objective of the Government is to establish
over the medium term an efficient and flexible system of resource mobilization
and allocation, which would respond rapidly to market forces and would offer a
wide variety of instruments to both savers and borrowers, make resources
available efficiently at positive real rates, and continue to grow in real
terms.
Macro-Economic Perspective
2.       The Government will pursue an economic system in which market forces
operate freely. The main function of the state in economic development should
be regulatory, helping to remove obstacles to the growth of productivity. The
direct activities of the state should be confined to the development of
infrastructure that serves the nation as a whole.
3.       Financial sector reform can only be carried forward within a
framework of sound fiscal and monetary policies. In the context of the
economic reform program, the Government has pursued monetary and fiscal
policies aimed at curbing the budget deficit, controlling inflation and
maintaining export growth. These policies have produced substantial results,
notwithstanding the setback that occurred in 1983. In 1984, GDP growth was
5.9 percent; it is estimated to have been 4.9 percent in 1985 and is projected
at 5.0 percent in the 1986 Annual Program. Inflation is likely to be lower,
at 38.2 percent in 1985 as compared to 53.5 percent in 1984 (both measured on
a December/December basis), and is projected to decline to 25 percent in 1986;
the budget deficit has been reduced substantially from 4.9 percent of GDP in
1984 to 2.3 percent in 1985, and is targeted to decline to 1.4 percent in
1986. The Government is fully committed to continue these policies.
Scope of Financial Sector Adjustment
4.       The Government proposes to address a wide range of issues in the
financial sector as actions in various areas are closely interlinked. The
principal issues lie in the areas of interest rates and selective credit
policies, the functioning of the commercial banking system, the development of
capital markets, and introduction of new financial services such as export
credit and insurance. The progress that has been achieved in the principal
areas during the last few years, and the steps the Government proposes to
take, are described more fully in the following paragraphs.



- 60 -
Annex 1
Page 3 of 10
Interest Rates and Credit Flows
5.       The Government's long-term objective, in keeping with the objective
of reducing the role of the state in the economy, is to allow market forces to
determine the level and structure of interest rates. HIowever, there are a
number of constraints which make it difficult to move immediately to full
liberalization of interest rates, including the volatility of international
interest rates, the lack of sufficient depth in the inter-bank money market
and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector. The Government has
already taken an important step toward liberalization of interest rates by
starting a system of weekly auctions of treasury bonds since the middle of
1985, in which the yields are determined freely according to availability of
funds ir -he banking system.  The Government's next objective would be to
encourage the development of a secondary market in Government securities which
would offer opportunities for shorter-term placement of funds.
6.       The Government is committed to maintain, and has maintained, positive
real rates on term deposits since the beginning of 1984. In setting deposit
rates, the Central Bank has also progressively provided higher yields on
longer maturity deposits to lengthen the average maturity of the deposit
resources in the banking system. The Central Bank will continue to review
trends in domestic as well as international credit markets, in conjunction
with the Government's inflation control program. Once inflationary
expectatic ts have been lowered sufficiently, it is the Government's intention
to liberalize deposit rates so that they are determined by market forces.
7.       In the area of lending, the Government recognizes that interest rates
remain high in real terms and tend to hinder investments. The Government's
objectives are to (i) reduce the difference between the interest rates on
preferential and non-preferential credits, (ii) reduce the flow of
preferential credit, and (iii) encourage the availability of medium and long
term credit for the productive sectors of economy. Substantial progress has
already been achieved in reducing the difference between the interest rates
on preferential and non-preferential credits during the past two years.
Interest rates on preferential credits available through the Central Bank's
rediscount facility have been raised by an average of about 17 percentage
points since the end of 1983, and banks are permitted to charge their normal
interest rate on the non-rediscounted part of a loan, thus raising the total
cost to the borrower of a typical blended loan package to real positive rates
for most categories of preferential credits. As a result of the substantial
rationalization of the rediscount facility in the past two years, there exist
basically only five categ ries of rediscount rates at present, as compared to
more than 30 categories three years ago. The total flow of credit through the
various rediscount windows has also been reduced sharply. The combination of
reduced flows and higher interest rates has resulted in a decline in the
proportion of preferential credit to the productive sectors of the economy to
only about 13 percent of total credit as of September 30, 1985. The
Government's intention is to maintain the progress in rationalization of
rediscount rates, with the objective of providing uniform treatment for all
investment credits supported by the facility.



- 61 -
Annex 1
Page 4 of 10
8.       The Government remains committed to achieving positive real levels on
preferential credits to the productive sectors of the economy by the end of
1986. The Government proposes to ensure that these interest rates remain at
positive levels thereafter by periodically reviewing and adjusting the rates.
As a result of periodic adjustment, the Government plans to reduce and
eliminate the implied subsidies on preferential credits to the productive
sectors.
9.       In order to stimulate private investment, the Government intends to
encourage the development of a resilient system of medium and long term
lending. This will require the strengthening of the capability of the
commercial banks to appraise investment projects, and placing the resource
availability to the development banks on a sound footing. Commercial banks
already have the freedom to set and adjust their lending rates in the light of
market conditions. The Government also intends to pursue the introduction of
interest rate mechanisms on medium and long term rediscounted loans designed
to reduce the interest rate risk to both borrowers and lenders in an
environment of fluctuating inflation.
10.      In 1984, the Government introduced a scheme to protect borrowers of
long term foreign currency loans for investment purposes from foreign currency
risk, and thus to encourage investment. This scheme, which is intended to be
a temporary expedient until the investment climate improves, is under the
Government's constant review. An examination of the need for the continuation
of the scheme will be carried out before the end of 1986, taking into account
the prevailing rate of inflation, the cost of financing from other sources and
the level of private sector investment.
11.      As a further measure to encourage the flow of credit from the banking
system to the private sector, the Government is introducing a withholding tax
on the income from holdings of Government bonds. This is expected to bring
the return, on an after-tax basis, of bond holdings closer to the return on
loans to the private sector, and thus encourage the use of the commercial
banks' loanable funds for lending to the private sector.
The Banking System
12.      The Government's long-term objective is to enhance Turkey's growth
prospects by improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the financial
sector, and particularly of its most important component, the commercial
banking system. These objectives are proposed to be achieved by fostering
increased competition to reduce intermediation margins, strengthening the role
of the Central Bank in offsite monitoring of commercial banks, improving
transparency in the functioning of banks by the introduction of standardized
accounting and by the introduction of independent external audit of banks.
The banking law which was introduced in 1983 has already brought about
improvements in the functioning of the banks. The law was further revised in
1985. The Government has licensed more foreign banks to open branches in
Turkey. The number of foreign banks has grown from six in 1980 to 16 in
mid-1985, thus encouraging competition among banks. The number of foreign
banks is expected to increase further.



62 -
Annex 1
Page 5 of 10
13.      The accounting system required in the banks has been completely
standardized following a major study carried out with the assistance of
consultants. Extensive discussions have been held with the banks, and the new
system is to be followed from January 1, 1986. Under the new system of
accounts, banks will be required to provide regular reports to the Banking
General Directorate of the Treasury, the Central Bank, and the Board of Sworn
Bank Examiners. These reports are designed to render the accounts of the
banks much more transparent and will enable the Government to monitor the
banks' performance more effectively and in a timely fashion.
14.      The introduction of the new accounting system and the Government's
objective of improving the efficiency of the banks has brought with it the
need to revise the system of bank supervision. The Government has decided
that the responsibility for the offsite monitoring of commercial banks would
be with the Central Bank. For this purpose, a monitoring and surveillance
department is being set up in the Central Bank. The Board of Sworn Bank
Examiners, which is responsible for the audit of banks, is also in the process
of revising its audit methods to give greater emphasis to the setting up of
management control systems in the banks rather than the detailed scrutiny of
individual transactions. The Government would welcome technical assistance to
train staff of these agencies to fulfill their increased responsibilities.
15.      Simultaneously with the introduction of standardized accounting in
the banks, the Government has announced that bank financial statements will be
required to be audited by independent external auditors commencing from 1987.
Tne Government is in the process of formulating criteria for the appointment
of auditors in time for implementation of this requirement.
16.      The capital adequacy of banks is being addressed by the Government
through provisions requiring higher minimum capitalization under the new
banking law. The capital structure of banks has been affected in recent years
by low profitability and by the bad and doubtful loans carried on their
books. With the liberalization of lending rates, banks have been able, in
1984-85, to increase their profits and to build up reserves. The standardized
accounting system will also enable an accurate assessment to be made of the
extent of non-performing loans in the portfolios of banks. In the near
future, the Government intends to take additional measures to enable banks to
set aside adequate provisions, such as permitting them to deduct provisions
for non-performing loans from their taxable profits.
Capital Market Development
17.      The development of the manrfacturing and non-financial services
sector in Turkey has in most cases been more dynamic than the development of
its financial instruments. The term-to-maturity of credit available in the
capital markets and the type of access to financial services available to many
firms are new seen to be a constraint to healthy growth of the corporate
sector. The part of the financial sector through which these problems are to
be addressed is the capital market. Anl enhanced role for this market would
help to make risk-reward relationships more transparent. It would also permit
firms to adjust their financial structure to lessen some of their debt burden,
assist entrepreneurs seeking to raise funds and permit greater private
participation in capital gains produced by economic growth.

18.      The Government has introduced measures to improve the regulatory
framework within which the capital market functions in the capital market law
which was issued in 1982.  Further measures the Government intends to
introduce will be aimed at improving the quality and quantity of the
information regarding corporate finances available to prospective investors in
the market. In approximately the same time-frame as that intended for the
introduction of external audit in the banking system, external audit of
corporations issuing securities in the market will be introduced. In parallel
with the introduction of audit, the issue of commercial paper will be
liberalized to enable corporations to meet their short-term requirements
directly from savers through the capital market.
19.      The Government is committed to the use of financial incentives to
promote the widening of shareholding in Turkey, in recognition of the social
benefits that result from increased shareholding by the public. Steps already
taken in this direction include removal of the ceiling of TL 3.0 million on
tax exempt income on equity holdings of individuals. Encouragement is also
being provided to corporations to issue additional capital to widen their
equity base by exempting premiums on issue of fresh shares from taxation.
20.      Tax concessions which would provide an incentive to corporations to
issue shares to the public are also under the consideration of the Government,
although this step will have to be taken concurrently with the introduction of
external audit of the corporations issuing the shares and also keeping in view
the likely impact on Government revenues.
21.      The inter-bank money market has grown rapidly in Turkey in response
to the reduction in the financial transactions tax from 15 percent in 1982 to
3 percent in 1984. The Government intends to support the growth of the
inter-bank market, which would enable banks to employ their short term
liquidity and improve efficiency in resource utilization.  To this end, the
Government is seeking legislative approval to further reduce the financiaa.
transactions tax.
Development of the Accounting Profession
22.      As the liberalization of the banking system and the development of
the capital market on a healthy basis will require provision of reliable
financial information to the public as well as the Government, the Government
has introduced legislation to set up . Board of Sworn Financial Advisers which
would set standards for auditors, educational and training requirements, and
criteria for admission to the accounting and audit profession. The Board is
expected to be set up, subject to passage of the legislation in the Grand
National Assembly, by mid-1986.
Medium-Term Measures
23.      In addition to the above measures which the Government is already in
the process of implementing, it is also intended that additional measures to
diversify the range of services offered by the financial sector will be

studied by the Government. These relate among others to tk.e setting up ot an
export credit insurance scheme, as well as the provision of medium and long
term credit to promote exports of capital goods. As the r4pital market
develops, the Government also intends to take up the question of enco.raging
the banks to sell off most of their equity holdings in corporations, and thus
widen corporate ownerships further. The Government would welcome technical
assistance from the World Bank in these areas.
Conclusion
24.      The Government would welcome an opportunity to discuss the above
adjustment measures and progress in their implementation with the Worl' Bank
before the release of the second tranche of the loan.  In the attachment to
this Statement, the specific policy measures the Government intends to carry
out in support of its program for financial sector reform are identified.

Definition of Positive Lending Interest Rates
and Preferential Credit
The most desirable course would -be to measure the flow of preferential
credit in the economy. However, it is generally difficult to measure the flow
of credit on an ex-post basis. The approach adopted here will be to measure
credit outstanding once every year which was originally extended at prefer-
ential rates, as the best possible measure.
I.      SHORT-TERM LOANS
(a)    Rediscounted Loan:  The Central Bank loan rediscount interest rate
applicable to the category of credit will be the starting point.
Commissions charged by the lending bank, applicable taxes, and
contributions (if any) to the Resource Utilization Support Fund (RUSF) will be
added to the applicable rediscount rate to obtain the final cost of the loan
funds to the borrower.
This final cost will be compared to the WPI change during the 12
months preceding the calculation. All credit which carries an effective cost
lower than the change in the WPI will be considered to be preferential credit.
(b)    Loans made out of commercial banks' own resources:  The method used
will be the same, except that the starting point of the calculation will be
the lending rate charged by the commercial bank.
II.      MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM LOANS
The method to be used for determining whether a particular category of
medium/long term credit is preferential or not comprises three steps:
(i) development of an index, composed of the change in the WPI during the
previous 12 months, and the projected change in the WPI during the next 12
months, both weighted equally; (ii) calculation of the effective cost of the
credit to the borrower, and (iii) comparison of the effective cost with the
index.
(i)    The index will be developed in the following manner:  The Government
will communicate its target rate of inflation for the year at the beginning of
the year to the Bank. The target should take the actual rate of inflation
(measured by the change in the WPI during the past 12 months) into account.
The target will be reviewed by the Bank, and the accepted figure will be
assigned a weight of 50%. The actual inflation also measured by the change in
the WPI during the preceding 12 months, will also be weighted 50% and added to
the first figure. The sum will be the index used to determine whether a
particular category of credit is preferential or not.

Page 3 of 3
(ii}    The effective cost of various categories of taedium- atid long-terum
credits will be calculated in the same manner as for short-term credits
(described above).
(iii)   The effective cost of each category of credit will be compared with
the index as developed once every year. All credit outstanding which has an
effective cost less than the index will be considered to be preferential
credit.

/I Preferential credit  asur  the aont of credit lent to the borrowr at a final cost nbich
is less than the prevailing inflation rate. Thus, all credit lent at a cost of
less than 36.6 prent (the Sept.-on-Sept. inflation rate) is considered to be
preferential as of Septeder 1985. The inflation rate  in 1193 and 1984 were 31.4 pret
and 50.4 percent respectively (annual average rates). Thus, all credits lent at below thme
respetive rates in 113 and 1984 is considered to have been preferential in tho   yers.

TURKEY
FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
FOR
THE CENTRAL BANK
1.       Background
The recent economic reforms and changes in the conduct of the
monetary policy have had a dramatic effect on the Central Bank and the banking
system.  The Central Bank has accomplished a great deal in its liberalization
programs in the financial markets and has an ambitious agenda for the next few
years. Some of the major projects which will be implemented soon are:
a.    Establishment of bank a supervision system.
b.    Development of an interbank market.
c.    Establishment of open market operations.
d.    Development of orderly money markets.
e.    Improvement in the clearing, settlement, and transfer systems.
Implementation of the above projects requires the availability of
skilled professionals in the Central Bank as well as at the Treasury and in
the private sector. Modern bank supervision methods are not well known in
Turkey. The Central Bank needs to improve the knowhow and skills of the staff
of its newly created Department of Bank Supervision. Furthermore, the
existing training program should be strengthened in order to provide much
needed training in money markets not only for its own staff but also for other
government and private organization.
2.       Concept for Training Program
There should be two components in assisting the Central Bank with its
training needs. The first component involves technical assistance to develop
skills in the area of bank supervision.  The second component involves
strengthening the current training programs.
2.1      The Bank Supervision Training Program.
The technical assistance in bank supervision should be coordinated
with the Board of Sworn Bank Auditors (BSBA), and the Banking Division of the
Treasury, since the Central Bank shares the responsibility for bank



- 85 -                      Annex 16
Page 2 of 4
supervision with these two agencies. The Central Bank has the experience and
facilities to organize the required training program. The Central Bank,
therefore, should assume the leadership role to develop training programs in
bank supervision area.
Bank examiner education is a continuous process. Educational
opportunities for most members of the bank supervisory agencies abroad are
limited to introductory seminars, infrequent seminars, and on-the-job
training. Training programs and development programs designed to enable
banking supervisors to maintain or improve their skills and stay abreast of
the latest changes in banking are not routinely available.
A program of continuous education should be developed for examiners,
financial analysts, and other supervisory staff members. The most pressing
needs in the Turkish banking sector are in the following areas: (i) new
concepts of supervision; (1) credit analysis; (iii) asset/liability
management; and (iv) financial analysis.
The knowledge to develop training methods in these areas is not
currently available in Turkey. The Central Bank needs a fulltime advisor for
a year who is currently a banking supervisor with excellent communication
skills to provide help in training and other aspects of bank supervision. The
respousibilities of this advisor would include:
(a)    Development of a program of continuous education for examiners with
special emphasis on training in new concepts of bank supervision,
credit analysis, asset/liability management, and financial analysis.
(b)    Guidance in the development of examination tools such as written
examination procedures and internal control questionnaires.
(c)    Advisory services to the Board of Sworn Bank Auditors, the Banking
Division of the Treasury, and the Central Bank in matters of bank
supervision.
An appropriate source for technical assistance in this area is the
U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The training programs in bank supervision should be supplemented by
fellowships to study at the OCC, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board in the U.S.
2.2      Strengthening the Central Bank Training Programs
The current training programs at the Central Bank are primarily
geared to its own personnel. The Directorate of Research at the Central Bank
has the experience to become the nucleus of a training center offering
training programs to the participants in the money markets as Capital Markets



86-                        Annex 16
Page 3 of 4
Board has become for capital markets. There are a large number of public and
private institutions in need of-such training.  Most have staff sizes that are
too small to justify separate training efforts. Strengthening the existing
training programs at the Central Bank results in substantial economies of
scale and cost savings by preventing duplication of training efforts in other
agencies.
The training programs at the Central Bank should include the
following subjects.
I.    Monetary Economics and Policy
a. Setting Monetary Policy
b.  Instruments of Monetary Policy
- interest rates
- open market operations
II.    Fiscal Policy and Financial Markets
a. Fiscal Policy
b. Alternatives for Financing the Government Debt
III.    Money markets;  Organization, Structure and Functions
a. Interbank Market
b.  Government Securities Market
c. Money Market Instruments and Determination of their Price
The above courses should be considered as a whole and they should be delivered
in a sequence of well coordinated seminars.
To deliver the courses above the Central Bank should:
(i) invite experts from abroad and (ii) hire a short-term consultant to
develop the curriculum outline above and to help identifying the proper
experts abroad.
As the proposed Banking Institute become operational, the Central
Bank should coordinate its course offerings with the Institute. Most Central
Bank abroad, particularly the Federal Reserve System, could help the Central
Bank to organize joint training programs. Most public organizations require
only travel and subsistence expenses to engage in this type of cooperation.
Furthermore, the Central Bank could also request cooperation from
correspondent banks.
The schedule and duration of seminars described in para 2.1 and 2.2
are given in Figure 1.
2.3      Beneficiary Organizations
Program described in para 2.1 and 2.2 should be open to all public
and private organizations. The following institutions, however, should be
given priority in admission.

(i)    Treasury
(ii)    The Board of Sworn Bank Auditors
(iii)   The Capital Markets Board
3.       Technical Needs of the Central Bank
The Central Bank needs a consultant on a short-term basis with
expertise in technology and computer application in commercial banks. The new
bank supervision procedures require the Central Bank to gather a. great deal of
data from commercial banks. The consultant should provide help to develop an
efficient automated information processing system.  Another area which needs
help from a consultant is the determination of proper technology in computer
applications to commercial banking sector. The need is approximately two
manmonths in 1986 and 1987.
4.       Training Program Cost Estimates
(a)    Capital Expenditures
The cost for teaching equipment and aids to supplement the current
facilities of the Central Bank is estimated at $108,000. This amount
includes personal computers, audio visual equipment, computer
software, and printing equipment.
(b)    Recurrent Expenditures
The recurrent expenditures consist of the following items
li) Program for Bank Supervision: Seminar expenses for foreign
faculty estimated at $36,000 salary plus benefits and travel
expenses for a consultant from the Comptroller of the Currency at
$42,000 in foreign currency and 3.2 million TL in local currency,
fellowships for two staff members per year at $67,200.
(ii) To Supplement Ongoing Programs: seminar expenses estimated at
$66,000; salary and travel expenses for a consultant to design
curriculum at one manmonth in 1986 and 1987 totalling $15,000 in
foreign currency 41.40 million TL in local currency.
(iii)  Technical Assistance:  salary and travel expenses estimated at
$28,000 for two manmonths in 1986 and 1987.  Local currency
component for consultancy expenses is estimated at 8,200
million TL.
Itemized budget is shown in figure 2 and the corresponding time estimated for
foreign faculty and consultants are shown in Figure 1.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
FOR
THE BOARD OF SWORN BANK AUDITORS
1.       Background
The Board of Sworn Bank Auditors (BSBA) is responsible for
supervising the banking system along with the Central Bank and with the
Banking Department within the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade.
The new Banking Law, dated April 25, 1985 and the amendments to the Central
Bank Law extend the responsibilities of these agencies to supervise the
banking system. In order to strengthen the system of bank supervision in
Turkey, modern concepts of bank management and of bank supervision should be
taught to the agencies responsible for bank supervision. Technical assistance
needs to be provided to the BSBA in order to improve the knowledge and skills
of Sworn Bank Auditors. This concept emphasizes a "top-down" approach
Incorporating the establishment of management control systems for banks.
2.       Concept and Program Administration
2.1      Concept
The knowhow to develop a program of continuous examiner education is
not currently available in Turkey. Therefore, the most expedient approach to
train the members of the BSBA is to cooperate with the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Washington, D.C. The OCC has the most
advanced training materials and skilled personnel in this subject. The joint
training program with the OCC should have two components. The first component
invt3lves sending members of the BSBA to the training programs of the OCC and
tle Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The second component
invnlven coordinating joint training seminars with the OCC and the Central
bank in Ankara.  The details of the second component are described in Annex 14.
,*1.2    Program Administration
The OCC offers a variety of courses on bank supervision at different
tinten and in different cities in the U.S. Sending students to these programs
stiptireo very close coordination with the International Relations and
Vieanrial Evaluation Division of the OCC.  The OCC typically needs two months
}siid tiwe to make room for services.  It is essential, therefore, that the
1t0;hA oppowint a training coordinator for scheduling nomination of qualified
PI-plicOtita, and other aspects of the program.



- 92 -                       Annex 17
Page 2 of 3
Courses offered by the OCC require substantial student participation
in classes. It is, therefore, crucial that all sworn bank auditors involved
in the program receive intensive English language training and become familiar
before taking the OCC courses in the U.S. The BSBA should establish an
objective criterion to evaluate the English language proficiency of the
candidates such as receiving a score of at least 500 on the TOEFL examination.
The foilowing courses are proposed based on the current catalog of
courses provided by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.
District Asset/Liability Management Seminar
District Credit Analysis School
Basic International Banking School
Intermediate International Banking School
Foreign Exchange/International Treasury Seminar
Bank Dealer Examination Techniques
Problem Bank Seminar
Discount Brokerage, Securities Lending, and
Repurchase Agreements
Futures and Forwards Seminar
Collateral
Large Dollar Wire Transfer
Agricultural Credit - Self Study
Construct-on/Real Estate Credit - Self Study
Energy Credit - Self Study
These courses will be supplemented with practical on-the-job exposure
as available.
The OCC program will be limited to six participants per year from the
BSBA.
3.       Consultancy Needs
The period in which the bank supervision system is to be set up is
short.  The proposed system is ambitious and the available knowledge is not
readily available in Turkey. The BSBA and the Central Bank need a technical
advisor who will help these agencies regarding various aspects of bank
supervision. The responsibilities of the consultant and the relevant budget
are explained in Annex 14.
4.       Program Costs
(a)    Capital Expenditures
The BSBA needs office equipment to be effective in executing its new
responsibilities. The equipment needs include personal computers (3
units), typing and printing equipment and computer software. The
cost is estimated at $51,000.

(b)    Fellowships
Six participants per year are expected to attend the OCC training
program in the U.S. The cost is estimated at $102,000 per year in
1986 and 1987. The amount includes travel and subsistence expenses
in the U.S.

TURKEY
FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
FOR
THE BANKING INSTITUTE
1.       Background
The Turkish banking industry is in the process of transforming itself
from an inefficient banking system to a modern and a competitive structure.
The process started in response to the economic liberalization programs
started in 1980 and has been accelerated by the entry of the foreign
commercial banks into the Turkish financial markets.
Operational efficiency in the Turkish banking system has been
traditionally low by any international standard. Furthermore, the
liberalization program and drive to open the Turkish economy into
international markets has brought new responsibilities and challenges that
cannot adequately be met with the existing knowhow and personnel skills in the
banking sector. Desired improvements in this sector necessitate the
introduction of modern banking methods and technology, upgrading and
internationalizing skills of existing personnel, and recruitment of new talent.
The need to upgrade the skills of new and existing personnel can be
best addressed by establishing a central training institute which would serve
the entire banking industry. A central training institute has two very
important advantages. Firstly, it would offer substantial economies of
scale. Secondly, training staff needs will be reduced to a manageable scale.
The available pool of potential trainers in Turkey is not large enough for
individual banks to establish their own training programs.
The proposed training institute or banking school will have the
following objectives:
1.    Upgrade and internationalize banking skills in the core functions of
credit/marketing, operations/technolt.gy, and treasury.
2.    Introduce the most recent developments and techniques in banking and
financial markets.
3.    Upgrade English language skills in the banking system.
4.    Upgrade training materials and instruction within Turkish banks.



-96-                        Annex l8
Page 2 of 7
The above objectives reflect the key areas for assistance to the
Turkish banking system. It is clear that a substantial teansfer of knowhow
and teaching talent from abroad is needed to achieve these objectives.
2.       Concept
The proposed banking school will be modelled after the Citibank
Training Center (MEADS) in Athens. The curriculum is designed by Citibank and
some minor changes will be made to meet the specific needs of the Turkish
banking sector. The official language of the school will be English. The
school will be residential and will own its facilities. In addition to
achieving the objectives stated in para 1, the institute would again to become
the preeminent banking school not only in Turkey but also in the Middle East.
Citibank will manage the school during the first five years without
charging management fees. Citibank's responsibilities under the management
contract are summarized in para 7. Although the legal framework has not been
worked out, the school will be owned by the Turkish Bankers Association
through a subsidiary.
The initial capital expenditures for buildings and grounds will be
provided by the Turkish Bankers Association.  The Bankers Association will use
itg accumulated funds which are earmarked for educational purposes. In the
event these funds are not sufficient, the Bankers Institute will levy fees on
its member to make up the difference. The operating expenses, however, will
be met from the tuition revenues generated by the core programs and fees from
the seminars.
3.       Need Analysis
Two surveys were taken to determine the demand for the-types of
training programs needed most urgently in the Turkish banking sector. The
first survey was conducted in July 1985 by a series of interviews with bank
presidents and officials who are responsible for internal training and
personnel 4dministration. The second survey was conducted by questionnaires
which were sent to bank general directors in October 1985. The second survey
was followed up by direct interviews in January 1986. The banks covered in
the survey employ more than three quarters of the 150,000 personnel employed
in the entire banking system.
Survey results indicate a substantial need to upgrade the skill level
in the Turkish banking industry. For example, less than 20 percent of the
employees hold unversity degrees and less than 4 percent speak a foreign
language. With the current pool of employees who are proficient in English
and with those who are entering the industry, under the most pessimistic
scenario, 150 students are expected to take the core programs in the first
year. Under more optimistic scenario, the enrollment may go as high as 450
students per year. The demand for special seminars is also expected to be
high.



-    -7          ~         Annex 18
Page 3 of 7
4.       Facilities
The banking school will be located in a building which is currently a
hotel in Dragos. There are 63 bedrooms on the top three floor of the hotel.
Rooms on the top two floors are large enough to accomodate 2 persons per
room. It is possible to house up to 105 students comfortably at any given
time. The capacity of the school can be increased by purchasing buildings
nearby.
There are no classroom facilities. Substantial reconstruction and
renovation work is needed to convert the current building to an adequate
teaching facility. The estimated cost for purchase and renovation is 3,040
million TL. It will be financed by the Turkish Bankers Association. The
foreign exchange component of the capital expenditures is estimated at
*882,000. The foreign exchange funds will be used to acquire state of the art
teaching equipment and computer facilities.
S.       Recurrent Costs
The foreign exchange component of the recurrent expenditures is
estimated at $825,000 for the first year and $756,000 for the second year.
The foreign exchange component covers the salaries plus benefits and moving
expenses for four teachers/administrators from Citibank, travel expenses for
four foreign members of the advisoLy board, and travel expenses and fees for
seminar instructors. The expected number of seminars is ten in the first year
and twenty in the second year.
Expenditures in local currency are estimated 313.4 million TL in the
first year and 446.8 million TL in the second year. These figures cover the
administrative expenses, salaries of the nine national teachers, local
subsistance expenses for advisory board and seminar instructors. Residential
expenses for room and board are not included in the estimates.
Recurrent expenditures both in foreign and local currency will be
financed from tuition revenues and seminar fees. The tuition revenues and
fees are not expected to cover all recurrent expenses in the first year. The
Bankers Association will finance the difference which will be amortized over a
reasonable period.
6.       Course Contents
6.1      Core Program
The banking school will offer three long-term core courses for entry
level personnel and short seminars on specialized topics designed for officers
and senior managers.
The core course contents and duration of the core programs are as
follows:

seminars in the first year and about 20 in the second year. Seminar expenses
will be financed from participation fees. The initial seminar subjects are
shown below. New seminar subjects will be added as needed.

7.       Program Management  Organization, and Delivery
7.1      Management and Organization.  The proposed institute will be
incorporated locally and owned by the Bankers Association. Management of the
institute is contracted to Citibank N.A., New York. Citibank agrees to mant.ZG
the institute on a not-for-profit basis.
The management contract gives the right and responsibilities to
manage all the academic and administrative affairs of the institute.
Under the management contract Citibank will:
a     provide the director as well as the teaching sraff and coordinators
for core programs and seminars;
b     develop the curriculum for the core programs and seminars;
c     provide the teaching materials which are used in similar Citibank
programs. Citibank will make the teaching materials available to the
institute without copyright charges.
d.    maintain the standards of excellence for the teaching staff,
curriculum, students and the overall management of the school.
The institute will have 10 local instructors. Half of them will ha-e
long-term (1-2 years) assignments. The other half will have short-term
assignments. The goal of the institute is to attract the local instructors
from the top 10 percent of the participating banks.



- 100 -                       Annex 18
Page 6 of 7
The director of the institute will have complete authority to manage
the institute.  Educational programs will be administered by three directors:
core credit program director, core operations/technology and treasury program
director, and seminars directors. A fourth director will be appointed to
manage support staff and all facilities. The four directors will report
directly to the director. The director will report to the Board of Trustees
of the Institute. The Board of Trustees represent the Turkish Bankers
Association and will be the ultimate policy making body of the Institute. The
Board will review the curriculum and other activities of the institute and
provide feedback on its performance.
The chairman of the Bankers Association will be the Chairman of the
Board of Trustees.  Other members of the Board should be distinguished
bankers, businessman and academicians from Turkey and abroad. Distinguished
Board members from the U.S. and other countries would provide credibility and
visibility in the international banking community. Furthermore, these board
members can provide help in identifying qualified leading staff from abroad.
The Board will have nine members including the chairman. The number can be
increased later if necessary.
The Organization chart of the school is shown in Figure 1.
7.2      Delivery and Evaluation
The program will use a highly active medium of instruction.
Classroom instruction will be participatory by using case studies, group
discussions and simulation games.
All programs, except some short seminars will be residential.
The medium of instruction will be English. Students would be
expected to be fluent in English. Language proficiency will be an important
criterion of admission to the program. For senior management seminars,
however, interpreter services will be made available. The institute will have
latnguage programs. These programs will be designed to improve the business
language and communication skills of students rather than to remedy their
language inadequacy.
8.       Project Implementation
The hiring of the director and teaching staff is expected to be
finalized in the first half of 1986. Renovation of the facilities is expected
to be completed by the end of 1986. September is a reasonable target to start
classes with a student body of 50 for the Core Credit Programs.
A five year project plan for courses and major decisions under the
Citibank Management Contract is shown in Figure 2. The school is expected-to
reach an steady student population of 250 trainees per year with 10 core
programs average and 20 seminars in the second year.

Page 7 of 7
A Plan to offer a Turkish counterpart of the program is also under
consideration. Since the target population for training in Turkish is much
-larger, the resource requirements in terms of facilities and teachers are also
proportionally greater. It is prudent to postpone the decision to offer a
Turkish program to the end of 1987 when more information will be available to
evaluate the success of the English Program. The estimates in this report do
not include the costs of a parallel Turkish program.
9.       Financins Plan
The detailed cost componente of the proposed banking institute are
shown in Figure 3. A summary of applications and sources of funds is shown
below:
1986                      1987

Capital Expenditures      696,000    2,580,000      186,000      360,000
B. Sources of Funds
Turkish Bankers Asso.                2,580,000
Contribution from Gov't. 696,000                    186,000      360,000
The financial operations of the school will be self-financing. Recurrent
expenditures will paid out of tuition revenues and seminar participation
fees. A loss of 561.2 million TL is expected in the first year. The loss
will be financed by the Turkish Bankers' Association as a loan. In subsequent
years, however, the school is expected to make a modest profit. Profits will
be used to pay off the operatin.g losses incurred in the first year and
curriculum development expenses.

TURKEY
FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAK
FOR
THE CAPITAL MARKETS BOARD
1.       Background
Capital markets are the smallest segment of the Turkish financial
system. Although there are encouraging signs of increased activity with the
newly established Istanbul Stock Exchange, the magnitude of funds raised and
traded in the Turkish capital markets is still very small in comparison to the
rest of the financial system. Development of capital markets is essential in
order to provide long-term risk capital for the sustained growth of the
Turkish economy.
Healthy development of capital markets and prevention of the repeat
of past mistakes that resulted in costly financial crises in late 70's require
substantial improvement over the current state of knowhow and skills of the
participants in the capital markets in Turkey. The need for training is
substantial in both public and private sectors.
The staff of most public and private organizations dealing in capital
markets, with the exception of Capital Markets Board (CMB), are usually too
small to undertake major training activities. A major part of current
training needs in the Turkish capital markets can be effectively and
economically addressed by strengthening the existing training programs of the
CMB and extending these programs to all public and private organizations.
Initially, the current training activities can be consolidated in the
Research and Development Department of the CMB. Eventually, as the volume of
training activities increases, an autonomous Training Center can be
established under the auspices of the CMB and with the support of other
organizations operating in the capital markets.
2.       Current training activities at the Capital Market Board.
The CMB has a well established training program for its entry and
middle level personnel. The current program is funded by the OECD and managed
by-the Rodney L. White Center for Financial Research at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania. The program for entry level personnel
consists of four weeks of classroom instruction on the campus of the
University of Pennsylvania and four weeks of visits and on the job training at
major stock exchanges, major Wall Street brokerage and investment banking
houses, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the National Association
of Securities Dealers.



- 108 -                     Annex 19
Page 2 of 5
The CMB, joint with the OECD, also organizes an. annual conference on
topical issues to educate the general public as well as the high level
officials in both public and private sectors. The participants so far have
been a group of distinguished academicians, Government officials and
practioners from all around the world. The OECD-CMB conference has been a
useful educational experience for many public officials who have been exposed
to number of important issues for the first time. Conferences also receive
very wide press coverage.
All these programs are considered as one of the most successful
educational projects of the OECD in Turkey.
3.       Concept for the proposed Training Center at the CMB
The  proposed training center will offer an extension of the
Wharton-OECD Program. The objectives of the proposed training center are:
(i)    to upgrade the knowledge and skills in the Turkish capital markets
for entry level personnel and senior management;
(ii)    to upgrade accounting skills in firms regulated by the CMB.
(iii)   to develop training materials for the securities industry.
In 1986, the training program will be administrated by the Rodney L.
White Center for Financial Research at the Wharton School jointly with the
Research and Development Department of the CMB. In 1987, the Research and
Development Department will establish a separate training center within the
same department. Since the number of potential trainees in capital markets
are small, there is no need for dedicated teaching facilities. The CMB will
rent floor space in Ankara to convert into classrooms and will rent seminar
facilities for courses to be delivered in Istanbul. The staffing needs are
also minimal for the Center. Current personnel in the Research and
Development will assume responsibility for managing the Training Center.
3.1      Training Program Components
The proposed training center will coordinate and organize the
following training activities:
(i)    Accounting Courses;
The Capital markets law in Turkey defines a publicly owned
corporation in very broad terms. All corporations with publicly
issued securities and also those with more than 100 shareholders are
classified as publicly held (open) corporations and they are by law
subject to the regulation by the CMB. Financial reporting skills in
many of these small corporations are well below any acceptable
minimum.  The CMB will design accounting courses to remedy these
deficiencies and promote uniform financial reporting standards in
these small corporations. Teaching staff and the funding for this
program will be provided by the CMB.



- 109 -                     Annex 19
Page a of 5
(ii)    Courses in securities markets:
The center will provide courses in securities markets for the entry
level personnel of the CMB and other public and private
organizations. This part of the program entails transferring the
course work of the Wharton - OECD program to Turkey. Courses will be
taught mostly by a foreign faculty. This component of the program
will be funded by the OECD.
(iii)   Fellowships to Study Abroad:
The OECD currently funds two fellowships programs at the CMB.
Comprising two month fellowships for junior staff to the Wharton-OECD
program in the U.S. and four month fellowships for expert staff to
the US and other European countries. In 1987, when the Wharton-OECD
program is moved to Turkey, junior staff fellowships will be
shortened to 4-6 weeks. The four or six week fellowships will
substitute for the second part of the Wharton-OECD program. Those
who successfully complete the course work and are proficient in
English will be eligible for this program.
The two OECD fellowships programs need to be supplemented in two
ways. First, the four month fellowship program should be extended to
eight months to allow expert staff to take courses for two semesters
at the Wharton School. The courses at the Wharton School are very
cost effective and efficient medium for expert staff to get in depth
training in their functional areas.  The cost of supplementing the
OECD fellowships will be limited to the incremental increase in
subsistence expenses only. The total need is about 12 manmonths for
3 candidates in 1986 and 1987. Second, the new fellowships should be
established for shorter, but, more frequent trips abroad to study and
survey special areas. The area in which the CMB needs the most help
is in observing computer applications and management information
systems in similar agencies abroad. The need in this category is 2
and 4 manmonths for 1986 and 1987.
The schedule of course programs and their duration are summarized on
figure 1.
(iv)    Seminars for Senior Managers:
The final component of training activities is to organize narrowly
focused short seminars on special topics in securities markets for
senior managers. The objective of the seminars is to respond on a
timely basis to new needs of the Turkish capital markets as they
evolve into new stages of development. These seminars can be
organized in conjunction with the training courses in securities
markets in (ii) above. Such timing allows the Training Center to
make use of the faculty which might be already visiting the CMB. By
inviting only a few additional instructors, these seminars can be
organized with substantial savings. The CMB can organize two
seminars in 1981 and 1987.

3.2      Beneficiary Organizations and individuals:
The programs described in para 3.1 will be open to all public and
private organizations and their personnel. Programs abroad will also be
available to interested organization. Travel expenses, however, will be
underwritten by the participants' organizations. OECD fellowships for the
entry level personnel (para 3.1 (iii)) will be open to all participants on a
competitive basis.
Staff of the following organizations would be immediate beneficiaries
of the CMB training programs.
(1)    Government Agencies
(i) Treasury
(ii) The Central Bank
(iii) Public Participation and Mass Housing funds
(iv) Other agencies which participate in Capital markets
(2)    Istanbul Stock Exchange
(3)    Banks and Securities Intermediaries which are members of the Istanbul
Sto.k Exchange
(4)    Corporations under the regulation of the CMB
4.       Technical needs of the Capital Markets Board:
the CMB is responsible for keeping records of all securities
transactions in the capital markets and financial statements of public
corporations. The CMB needs occasional technical assistance to develop a
viable management information systems within the CMB and to establish rapid
communication with the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The estimated need is two
manmonths in 1986 and 1987.
5.       Training Program Cost Estimates
a.    Capital Expenditures
The CMB will rent and refurnish classrooms facilities in Ankara and
Istanbul in order to carry out the training programs described in
para 3.1. The cost of rent and renovation is estimated at 25 million
TL in 1986 and 50 million in 1987.
Teaching equipment and aids for the training center core estimated to
cost $54,000 in 1986 and $96,000 in 1987. Teaching equipment and
aids include personal computers, audiovisual equipment, computer
software, and printing and copying equipment.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
FOR
THE DIRECTORATE OF THE TREASURY AND FOREIGN TRADE
1.       Background
The Undersecretariat of the Treasury and Foreign Trade has an
unusually wide array of duties and responsibilities. The Treasury faces new
challenges as its role goes through major change as a result of the new
alignment of its responsibilities along with Central Bank, the Ministry of
Finance and the Treasury.
The diversity of the Treasury's responsibilities makes it virtually
impossible to design a comprehensive training program. An efficient way to
address Treasury's training needs is to provide fellowships and advisory
services in areas where they to improve specific skills.
2.       Training Needs
The staff of most departments of the Treasury needs training in the
basics of capital and money markets, government securities markets, and price
theory. The Treasury should coordinate with the Capital markets Board which
will offer courses in these areas in 1986 and 1987.
There are also specific training needs of those departments in the
Division of Public Finance. Fellowships should be provided to the staff of
the following departments to study abroad to attain the desired skills.
2.1 Treasury Department
The dramatic increase in the government debt securities and debt
management necessitate training the staff of this department in:
(a)    Comparative studies of debt financing and debt management in
developed economies.
(b)    Cash management and cash flow forecasting techniques employed in
other countries.
(c)    Computer applications in debt and cash management.

2.2      Department of State Economic Enterprises
This department is responsible for the financing of state economic
enterprises. The recent Government policy is to require the state economic
enterprises to raise their own funds in capital markets rather than resorting
to Treasury financing. The staff of this department should visit several
countries which are experienced in alternative forms of financing for state
owned enterprises.
2.3      Department of External Debt management
The major goal of this department is to develop a computerized system
for the management of foreign debt. The staff should visit countries where
successful advanced debt management system are implemented.
2.4      Department of Banking
The Department of Banking shares the responsibility for bank
supervision with the Board of Sworn Bank Auditors and the Central Bank. The
staff of this department should receive training in bank supervision in a
fashion similar to the Sworn Bank Auditors.
The total need for fellowships to study the areas listed above is
eight manmonths in 1986 and ten manmonths in 1987. These fellowships should
be divided among the four departments listed in para 2.1 through 2.4.
3.       Consultancy Needs
The Treasury needs a consultant to help it to develop the
computerization of Treasury operations.  The areas where there is a reasonable
urgency are: the management of external debt where major computerization work
has been already started; cash flow management for the Treasury; and internal
debt management. Consultancy needs are approximately three months in 1986 and
1987.
4.       Equipment Needs
In order to complete the computerization of function listed in
Para 3, the Treasury should be given personal computers (6 units) and computer
software packages and peripheral equipment.
5.       Cost of Technical Assistance Programs
The cost of technical assistance to the Treasury is estimated for the
following categories at: $58,200 for computer hardware and software;
$95,000 for fellowships; (eight manmonths in 1986 and ten manmonths in 1987);
$47,200 for consultancy services including travel expenses.
