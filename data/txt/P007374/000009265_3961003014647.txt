HEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
D m LOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC O  HONDURAS FOR THE MORAZAN DAM EMERGENCY PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Republic of Honduras
for SDR 8.83 million, the equivalent of US$12.0 million, on standara IDA terms
with a maturity of 40 years to help finance the Morazin Dam Emergency Project.
The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the National Power Company
(Empresa Nacional de Energia El6ctrica - ENEE) for 20 years, including 5 years
ef grace, with interest at 7.60 percent per annum. The Interamerican
Development Bank (IDB) would be providing US$1.6 million of parallel financing
to support the purchase and installation of equipment through amendment of an
existing energy sector operation.
2.        Background.  Until recently, Honduras' energy sector faced a number
of unresolved issues, including the lack of a comprehensive energy policy and
strategy and a sound regulatory framework, d4istorted pricing policies for
electricity and petroleum products, and a financially weak and inefficient
national power company (ENEE) which placed a heavy burden on public finances
and on the country's balance of paymeut.. These issues are now being
addressed under the Government's Energy Sector Adjustment Program (ESAP),
supported by an Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC) of SDR 37.95 million
(US$50.6 million equivalent) which was approved by the Executive Directors in
October 1991. The first ESAC tranche was released in December 1991. Progress
under the ESAC has been satisfactory. The Government (GOH) has continued to
implement the agreed tariff program and ENEE has satisfactorily complied with
its obligations under the Contract Plan, particularly with respect to
financial and staff reduction targets. Release of the second ESAC tranche is
now expected for November, rather than August 1992 (as originally planned),
due to delays in initiating key studies and technical assistance activities
supported under the ESAC. Efforts are being made to accelerate these
activities. Any possible future IDA assistance to the sector would be
considered based on ESAC-supported studies, covering rural energy needs and
greater involvement by the private sector.
3.        One of the major causes of ENEE's difficult financial situation has
been its heavy debt service for the El Caj6n Dam and Hydroelectric Power Plant
(rensmed Francisco Morazin in March 1992) partially financed by the Bank
through a US$105 million Bank loan (Ln. 1805-HO) and a US$20 million
equivalent IDA credit (Cr. 989-HO) which were approved in March 1980. In
1991, the Moraz&n power plant generated 1,487 GWh, equivalent to 70Z of total
electricity generation in Honduras. The cost of construction, including
transmission lines and financing charges, amounted to US$785 million.
4.        Construction of the Morazin Dam and underground power station was
completed in 1985. The dam is a double-curvature, high (225m) concrete arch
(among the ten highest in the world) and impounds a reservoir of 5.7 million
cubic meters. The power station is located about 200 meters below the ground
on the left abutment and contains four units, each generating 73 MW. The
station is connected to the national grid by a double circuit transmission
line at 230 kV: the Northern branch to El Progreso substation (40km) and the
Southern branch to Tegucigalpa (140km) (see Map IBRD 23948).



- 2 -
5.        The dam is located about 3 km downstream of the confluence of the
Humuya and Sulaco rivers in a gorge of limestone formation covered by volcanic
rock. The limestone outcroppings at the site have four main vertical faults
running parallel to the river. Karst in the limestone occurs in the form of
cracks and large cavities of irregular shape, most of them filled with clay.
Rock permeability is related to fractures and karst. Originally, a
conventional vertical grouting curtain was designed to waterproof the dam
foundation. However, when excavation for the dam was compleced, based on a
reexamination of the geological conditions, it was concluded that the original
sealing curtain would not be appropriate. Instead, a relatively novel sealing
scheme was designed combining shallow vertical and wide horizontal grouting
zones forming a tub-shaped seal (Map 23947) at a small additional cost.
6.        In 1986, two years after the filling of the reservoir, hydrostatic
pressures at the dam foundation had increased abnormally (by about 20 meters),
indicating breaches in the impermeabilized zone. Deep drain holes were drilled
at the base of the dam and downstream of the originally treated grouting zone
which relieved the pressures but resulting seepages containing clay remained
excessive. The location of renewed higher pressures and evidence of clay in
the discha!ges pointed to erosion of zones in several areas.  A grouting
program was carried out in 1987-1989 to seal the major leaks and control the
erosion they were causing. Pressures and seepage were reduced to acceptable
levels, but a side effect, noticed first in late 1989, was the increase in
underground water seepage into the power plant from new channels.
7.        A more extensive sealing program is now urgently needed to control
pressure buildups and subsequent erosive flows in the left abutment, because
these could eventually reduce the strength of the abutments and cause the dam
to fail. Water seepage at the dam has increased dramatically over the last
year and has reached a point where, if left untreated, it could result in
serious damages to the dam's structure or even collapse. The proposed project
will assist ENEE to carry out an emergency sealing program and to improve its
monitoring of dam performance and emergency preparedness.  The design of the
sealing program was prepared by ENEE with the assistance of highly specialized
international consultants. It was reviewed by the Panel for the Secsrity of
the Dam (PSD), a group of international experts, which has been in place since
the beginning of dam construction in 1980, and international consultants
independently contracted by IDA.
8.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The Bank and
IDA have had considerable involvement in the power sector in Honduras, with
eight loans and four credits amounting to US$290.4 million equivalent. Except
for the ESAC, all operations assisted in the financing of generation and dis-
tribution projects which were completed successfully despite some delays and
cost overruns. The main conclusions of the PCR and the PPAR (SecM89-930, dated
July 13, 1989) were that the El Caj6n project had been well-prepared and
designed, completed ahead of schedule and that it had satisfactorily addressed
environmental issues. However, it was too large for its actual market, as
expected demand growth largely failed to materialize. As a result, the project
has strained the capability of ENEE and the Honduran economy to service debt,
and thereby contributed to Honduras' balance of payments difficulties.



9.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The country assistance strategy for
Honduras provides for IDA support for the GOH's macroeconomic and sectoral
adjustment efforts through policy-based lending and selected investment
projects, particularly those targeted at poverty alleviation and
rehabilitation of critical infrastructure. Consistent with this strategy, the
proposed project would assist in preventing a potential economic and
environmental disaster and in ensuring the continued availability of the
country's key source of electricity supply. Specifically, IDA involvement in
the project is important to: (i) ensure that the engineering design and
execution of the impermeabilization works are sound; (ii) provide for
additional measures to improve dam safety and monitoring; and (iii) help ENEE
establish the capacity to handle future similar situations if needed. IDA's
financial support would permit ENEE to meet other critical and immediate
investment needs while not undermining the utility's financial rehabilitation
program. Among the original financiers of the dam, only IDA and the IDB have
the necessary technical capacity to assist ENEE.
10.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project would: (i) maintain the structural
integrity of the Moraz&n dam by controlling excessive seepage and hydrostatic
pressures under the dam foundation; (ii) increase the reliability of the power
plant's auxiliary system thereby minimizing the risk of interruption of the
principal source of the country's electricity supply; and (iii) strengthen
ENEE's emergency preparedness planning and its capacity to monitor dam perfor-
mance and manage possible similar future seepage problems at the Morazin dam.
11.       Proiect Description.  The project (see Map 23947) consists of: (a)
an underground investigation program with deep rock borings (about 46,000
linear meters) and corresponding instrumentation, followed by high pressure
injection of sealants (about 14,000 metric tons) into the rock mass (84% of
total project cost); (b) impermeabilization of the power plant sump,
construction of additional drainage galleries (about 300m) to evacuate
filtrations by gravity flow, lining of inspection gallery and plugging of the
diversion tunnel (5.5Z); (c) purchase and installation of additional
electrical and mechanical equipment to substantially increase service
reliability of the auxiliary electrical system of the power plant (42); (d)
purchase and installation of new and complementary instrumentation to monitor
foundation pressures and water filtrations (2.5%); (e) about 32 man-months of
consulting services (32) to: (i) supervise the impermeabilization works; (ii)
carry out a structural and electro-mechanical safety review of the dam; and
(iii) assist in the preparation of an emergency preparedness and evacuation
plan; and (f) training of ENEE staff in underground investigations, pressure
sealing of foundations, monitoring of hydrostatic foundation pressures and
water leakages in high dams and electrical system stability, through visits to
other plants and ongoing foundation sealing programs abroad (12).
12.       The total project cost is estimated at US$17.4 million equivalent,
with a ioreign exchange component of US$9.3 million equivalent (53%). The
proposed Credit would finance 69% of total project cost. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of



4 
Bank Group operations in Honduras are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively.  To avoid any delays in correcting the water seepage which could cause
dam failure, retroactive financing of up to US$600,000, equivalent to 5Z of
Credit proceeds, is recommended for expenditures incurred since April 1, 1992.
13.  Proiect Implementation.  ENEE would be the executing agency for the
project. ENEE's technical capacity is sound based on the experience gained by
its engineering staff during the construction of the Morazfin dam and
subsequent impermeabilization works. Its financial position has also been
signific ntly strengthened as a result of the actions supported under the
ESAC. The proposed project would be implemented through a single contract for
civil works, awarded through ICB, and multiple cortracts for acquisition of
special electrical and mechanical equipment, and motorized vehicles.
Experienced ENEE engineers will supervise the works, assisted by a consulting
engineering firm, highly qualified in this specialized rield of civil
engincering. ENEE staff will also be assisted by the PSD which will carry out
quarterly reviews of the progress of the works. As part of the decen-
tralization efforts supported under the ESAC and to ensure effective dam
management, the dam and plant will be constituted as a separate operating unit
with iLdependent decision-making authority.
14. Proiect Sustainability. Upon completion of the project, all critical
pressure areas and filtration currents will be monitored closely with
additional new and existing instruments that have been thoroughly examined and
calibrated. Instrument readings at all critical locations, now read
individually, will be monitored at a central control board. Other actions
supported under the project to enhance monitoring and improve dam performance
comprise: (i) a safety review of the dam structure and electro-mechanical
equipment and preparation of an action plan to implement the review's
findings; (ii) annual reviews by the PSD; (iii) preparation by ENEE of an
emergency preparedness and evacuation plan; and (iv) a training component to
strengthen ENEE's staff skills in foundation exploration, pressure grouting,
dam monitoring and electrical system stability. As a result, the risk of a
similar problem arising and remaining undetected in the future will become
very small and ENEE's ability to deal with any increase in water filtration
will have been built up to a satisfactory level.
15.       Actions Azreed.  During negotiations agreements were reached with:
(A) the GOH to ensure that sufficient funds are provided through ENEE as
indicated in the project financing plan and as needed to complete the project;
and (B) ENEE to: (a) contract consultants to complete a safety review of the
dam's structure and electro-mechanical systems by December 31, 1992, and
submit to IDA by January 31, 1993 a plan of action to correct the problems and
deficiencies identified during the review; (b) complete execution of the first
phase of the program to increase reliability of the auxiliary electrical
system by December 31, 1992 and the entire program by March 31, 1993; (c)
maintain trained and capable staff at the dam site to monitor dam performance
and the results of the sealing works; (d) create a decentralized operating
unit for the Moraz&n power plant by September 30, 1992; (e) contract for
quarterly supervision visits by the PSD during project execution and annual
visits thereafter, and submit to IDA the PSD's report within 30 days of the



- 5 -
PSD's visit; (f) provide the GOH and IDA quarterly progress reports during the
execution of the project; and (g) complete, and put in place, an emergency
preparedness and evacuation plan to be submittsd to IDA by December 31, 1992.
16.       Conditions of effectiveness would bet (i) signing of a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Borrower and ENEE, satisfactory to IDA; and (ii)
satisfactory amendment of the IDB energy sector hybrid loan agreement to
provide IDB cofin#ncing funds.
17.       Environmental Aspects.  The proposed project is rated C and does
not pose environmental problems. On the contrary, delay or failure to carry
it out promptly and according to highest technical criteria would pose a major
environmental risk, as the structural integrity of the dam could be placed in
jeopardy. The threat of dam collapse, because of increasing seepage, would
require rapid lowering of the re.ervoir, resulting in downstream flooding and
would cause ar. increase in air polluting thermal generation to offset the drop
in hydroelectric power generation. Actions to strengthen ENEE's environmental
asseAsment capacity and establish clear safeguards for environmental protec-
tion as part ef it's investment planning are being supported under the ESAC.
18.       Proiect Benefits.  The main project benefit would be to enhance the
economic merits of the investment already made for the Moraz&n Dam and
Hydroelectric Power Plant by ensuring the safety of the dam and the
reliability of its auxiliaries, thereby extending its useful operating life.
The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 42%.
19.       Risks.  There is a remote risk that the present seepage problem may
worsen before project works are initiated. This could require emergency
lowering of the reservoir and could result in shut-down of the Moraz&n plant
with adverse economic effects. Speedy project implementation would reduce
this risk and IDA has been assisting ENEE to expedite the initiation of works.
There is also a risk that other seepage sources could appear after the
impermeabilization program has been completed. The exploratory drilling
component of the project has been designed to reduce this risk. Finally, the
impermeabilization cost could be greater than estimated. This is not
perceived as a major risk. If it were to occur, ENEE would be able to provide
the additional funds necessary to complete the program by deferring lower
priority investments, and the IDB would be prepared to consider assisting ENEE
with complementary financing.
20.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.
