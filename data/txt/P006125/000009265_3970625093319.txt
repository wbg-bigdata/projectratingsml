PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA - SMALL SCALE MINING DFVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1331-BO)
RIGRlLIGRTS
1.        This project, the Bank's third mining operation In Bolivia,
assisted the development of small scale mining by: (a) financing to the
national mining bank, Banco Winero (BAMIN), for the preparation, development
and exploitation of specific small mining subprojects through subloans
(including technical assistance to improve institutional development,
especially management control and project appraisal capability);
(b) assistance to the National Geological Service (GEOBOL) in continuing a
survey and preinvestment studies of small mines (which bad started as part of
an earlier Bank credit) and in strengthening GEOBOL's mineral analysis
capacity; and (c) technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and
'Metallurgy (MM) for policy plaaning and a cadastral survey (including the
technical assistance component of a previous Bank mining operation, Credit
455-RU, the finance component of which had been evaluated earlier) (para
2.02).
2.        The overall impact of BAMIN's subloans, which accounted for the
major portion of the Rank loan, has been satisfactory. The majority of
subborrowers utilized the loan resources efficiently to modernize and/or
expand their mining operations (para 3.10). However, because of a lack of
proper advice, technical assistance and followup, many small gold mining
operations utilized inadeouate processing and concentrating technology, which
resulted in poor recovery levels and, thus, in substantial losses of gold
reserves to the Government of Bolivia. These subprojects, located in the
remote Tipuani area, absorbed about 30Z of all subloans amounts (para 3.13).
3.       While the results at the subborrower level have met the project's
general objectives, one important obiective has not been achieved: BAMIN's
development into a more modern, efficient banking organization for Bolivia's
mining sector. BAMIN's overall performance has been weak throughout the
project cycle. High management turnover, insufficently qualified staff and
political factors have hindered its operational capabilities. Its
supervision activities and technical assistance to borrowers continue to be
inadequate (para 4.15). In addition, BAMIN's financial performance has been
poor: because of several devaluations and unsatisfactory loan collection,
its equity has been eroded substantially (paras. 4.21 - 4.25). As a result
of these combined factors, BAMIN's resource mobilization capability has not
been developed, limiting its ability to carry on efficiently and to expand
its lending operations (para 4.08). However on the positive side, there have
been slight improvements in RAMIN's organizational structure, external
auditing, accounting Procedures and technical appraisal capability even
though the originally expected standards were not reached.



4.       The technical assistance component of the loan was a continuation
of the technical asssitance (TA) under a previous wining credit to Bolivia.
In their entirety, these components were multifaceted and resulted in a
mixture of failures and successes. While a good portion of TA under Credit
455-30 was satisfactorily implemented, the TA components under Loan 1331-Bo
bad a more complex conception. Few tangible results were achieved, chiefly
because of unclear project designs, implementation responsibilities having
been too widely spread and designed targets having been too long-term
oriented. Additionally, and despite considerable Bank supervision, project
implementation was influenced by a lack of political continuity and overall
institutional weaknesses (paras. 5.01 - 5.05).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA - SMALL SCALE MINING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1331-RO)
I. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.01      This project completion report reviews Loan 1331-BO, which provided
financing to assist the development of small scale mining in Bolivia and
technical assistance (TA) to several institutions involved in the mining
sector. The report also includes a review of the TA components of Credit
455-BO.
1.02      Bank Group involvement in Bolivia's mining sector goes back to
1972, at which time the investment priorities, as set out in the Mining and
Metallurgical Sector Report (PI-14), provided a basis for a Bank lending
program. A first USS6.2 million IDA Credit (455-RO), which was made in 1974,
and which is fully disbursed, helped the Government in mining policy and
administrative areas and assisted in financing medium mining enterprises
through the private Banco Industrial S.A. (BISA). A followup sectoral
mission, which visited Bolivia in early 1976, continued and updated the
findings of the previous sector report. During the same year, two mining
credit loans were made:  a USS10.0 million loan (1290-BO) through BISA to
finance medium mines and also industry; and the loan under review (1331-BC)
of US$12 million to provide supervised credit to small mining enterprises
through the Bolivian Mining Bank (BAMIN), and to finance technical assistance
and equipment for the Ministrv of Kines and Metallurgy (NMW) and the Bolivian
Geological Service (GEOBOL).  In 1979, another IDA Credit (940-BO) for USS7.5
million was made to assist the National Mineral Exploration Fund (FNEM), in
reducing the financial risk of exploration and mining development
activities. The loan under review for small mining was thus an integral part
of a continuous assistance program for Bolivia's mining sector initiated in
the 1970s.
Economic and Sectoral Environment
1.03      Mining is one of the most important sectors in Boliviats economy
because of its significant contribution to the country's exports and to the
fiscal revenues of the Government. In 1992, mineral exnorts, excluding
hydrocarbons, were US$324 million, or 43.4% of total exports, and mining
taxes amounted to 15% of the total fiscal revenues of the Central
Government. The sector's share in GDP is rather low, 5.7% in 1982-partly
due to the inclusion of metallurgical activities %ithin the industrial
sector-and it has been falling in recent years as a result of depressed
mining conditions.



-2-
1.04      The sector's contribution to the economy normally varies with the
fluctuations of international metal prices. Over the past few years,
however, depletion of ore reserves in the existing mines, lack of development
of new reserves and discriminatory taxation -coupled with the slower growth
in industrial countries and Bolivia's overall economic instability-have
resulted in an actual decline of production of major minerals and reduced the
relative sector contribution even when prices were favorable. As a
consequence of the problems in the sector, investment has been grossly
inadequate for the appropriate development of existing mines and for new
exploration, while mining profits, instead of being reinvested, often have
been channeled to other sectors.
1.05      Mining producers in Bolivia are classified in the following three
main categories:l / (a) Corporacion Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL), operating
14 large a..d medium-sized state-owned mining complexes; (b) about 24
privately owned medium mining companies; and (c) between 2,000 and 4,000
small mines operated either privately or by cooperative arrangements.
COHIBOL's mining operations contribute to about 65Z of total mineral
production and 35% of sectoral employment; the medium mines are respons'ble
for 25-30% of the national mineral output and 9% of employment, while the
small mines contribute to 10-15% of national production and 56% of
employment.
II.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
2.01      Bank lending for Bolivia's mining has been oriented toward medium
and small mines with economic Potential and toward the building of financial
institutions which could provide supervised credit and technical assistance.
The main goal of the Rank program for the small mining sector was a gradual
transformation of small mining units with development potential into
efficient mining enterprises. The specific objective of the loan under
review was the development of preselected small mining operations through the
provision of supervised credit with complementary technical assistance. In
order to ensure availability of development credit and technical assistance
to small miners, and to induce improved sectoral policies, the project aimed
at:(a) financing and strengthening BAMIN, the selected credit intermediary;
(b) upgrading the technical capabilities of GEOBOL; and (c) providing
assistance to MMM in sectoral planning, including a cadastral survey.
2.02      Specifically, the project originally consisted of finanzing the
foreign exchange costs of three complementary components:
(a)  A credit program of US$9,000,000 equivalent to assist RAMIN
in financing feasibility studies and subloans for the
preparation, development and exploitation of small mining
projects;
(b) Assistance to GEOROL of US$1,900,0OO to:
1/ For a more detailed description of these three categories, see Annex 5.



-3-
(i)  continue the survey of small mines throtgh financing of
related equipment needs and foreign experts, and to
strengthen GEOBOL's capability for preparing
prefeasibility studies of mining projects and for
providing comprehensive technical assistance to BAMIN's
credit beneficiaries; and
(ii) strengthen its mineral analysis capacity.
(c)   A technical assistance program of US$1,100,000 composed of:
(i)  expert assistance to improve the planning capability of
M4;
(ii) equipment and expert assistance to carry out a cadastral
survey of MMM; and
(iii)  consulting services for BAMIN to improve its project
appraisal and supervision capability and its management
control system, including accounting.
2.03      The initial allocation of loan funds was slightly changed when, in
early/mid-1981, it became apparent that, due to several constraints and
difficulties faced in the implementation of the technical assistance
components,2/ it was unlikely that the amounts initially allocated for the
two TA components would be utilized fully. Consequently, taking also into
account the speedup of new subloan approvals by BAMIN at that time, the Bank
decided to agree,3/ upon the borrower's request, to reallocate US$1 million
from the technical assistance components to the credit component.
The original allocation and the amended allocation of loan funds
were as follows:

ITI.  TMPLEMENTATION OF THE CREDIT COMPONENT
Proiect Implementation
3.01      The loan Faced several initial problems which delayed startup
considerably. The loan did not become effective until ten months after Board
approval, on July 1', 1977.  The delay was mainly due to personnel changes in
the Ministry of Mines and Metallurgy (4MM). In particular, there were delays
in signing the subsidiary loan agreement (Section 6.01(b)), arranging for the
Government's payment of the first capital iustallment to RAMIN (Section
6.01(c)), and in the selection of consultants for BAMIN's Technical
Department (Section 6.01(h)), the responsibility of which rested with MMM.
The closing date had been set originally for December 31, 1980, but had to be
extended twice:  initiallv to December 31, 1981, / and finally to December
31, 1982.5/
3.02      The initially established disbursement percentages (100% of the
cost of imports, 60% o goods purchased locally and 35Z of construction
costs) were intended to result in the Bank financing, on average, 70% of the
total project costs (the estimated foreign exchange component of mining
projects) and about 80Z of BAMIN subloans. This arrangement was based on the
expectation that BAMIN would finance fewer but larger projects. Since the
average size of subp.cjects actually financed turned out to be smaller,
direct imports were appropriate only in a few cases while, in most cases,
imported goods were purchased locally. Thus, the existing loan disbursement
procedures resulted in the Rank financing about 50% of RAMIN's loans, instead
of 80%, as originally intended. Therefore, the Bank revised the disbursement
percentage, increasing it to 80% of RAMIN subloans across the board without
differentiating between local and foreign Purchases (Bank's letter of
5/16/1980).
3.03      The first suoproject was approved in November 1978, more than one
year after effectiveness. Thereafter, loan utilization improved gradually,
and, by December 1981, two years after the original closing date for
subproject submission (12/31/79), all funds were committed. Disbursements
lagged, partly because of lack of bridge financing, and also because of the
unfamiliarity of BAMIN and its small mining clients with Bank standard
requirements for disbursements and subproject appraisals.
3.04      As late as 1979, the pipeline of BAMIN subprojects was still very
weak becauoe the demand for investment credit from small miners had been
reduced becauss of political unrest and uncertainty. Consequently, few loan
requests had been received, and less than USS2 million had been committed by
the end of 1979. By that time, Bank expectations of the loan being fully
committed by the en.d of 1981-as was then envisaged--were so low that a
supervision mission tentatively recommended a partial reallocation of USS3
million from the crelit component of the loan to BISA. However, as a result

of intensified promotional efforts and BAMIN's special emphasis on gold
mining operations, the project pipeline firmed up and commitments in the
first half of 1980 increased considerably (by about US$4 million), making it
then appear feasible that BAMIN could commit the entire amount of the credit
component by the end of 1981. Consequently, the tentative previous
recommendation to reallocate funds from this component was dropped.
3.05      Subsequently, and reversing the previous trend, an increase rather
than a decrease in demand for BAMIN's subloan funds became apparent. On July
24, 1981, the Bank approved a reallocation of US$1 million from the technical
assistance components to the credit component, based upon the difficulties
faced in carrying out the technical assistance component for MM and GEOBOL
(nara. 5.03 and Annex 6), and taking into account the continuous improvement
in BAMIN's subproject pipeline. New subloans continued to be approved by
BAMIN throughout 1981, and, by the end of that year, the full amount of the
credit component has been committed.
Subprojects Financed Under the Loan
3.06        A total of 40 subloans to private, domestically owned mining
establishments were financed under the credit component, with a total cost of
about USS13 million, of which the Bank subloans financed US$9.9 million.
Twenty subprojects were small (below US$100,000), and subloans for them
totaled US$1.11 million (112 of the total loan). The other subprojects,
medium-sized, absorbed USS8.74 million of the Bank subloans (89% of the
total) and included four which amounted to US$1 million or more.
3.07      Of the total 40 subloans, 28 (or 70% of the total number) were for
financing new enterprises, while 12 (30x) financed expansions and
modernization of existing mining operations.
3.08      Fifteen subprojects were for tin mining (amounting to 57.1% of the
total approved subloan amo-unt), 16 for gold (29.5Z of total subloan amount),
and the remaining for tungsten, limestone and lead/silver. It should be
noted that BAMIN s orientation toward gold mining was not envisaged during
loan preparation. While this change of focus was instrumental in helping to
commit and disburse one third of the loan, it also caught RAMIN off guard
with regard to the policy implications which arose within this area of mining
(para. 3.13).
3.09      A complete list of the subprojects financed is presented in
Annex 4, Tables la and lb. A detailed breakdown of subprojects by enterprise
ownership, investment cost, and type of subproject is included in Annex 4,
Table 2.



-6-
Impact and Current Status of Subprojects
3.10      Based upon a sample of on-site visits to subprojects6/ (private
and cooperative organizations, i cluding small and medium mines producing
different minerals), it appeared that most investments financed under the
project were sound and have been carried out successfully. The subborrowers
have achieved their basic objectives of modernizing and/or expanding mining
activities and strengthening their overall operations.7/
3.11      A few subprojects, however, have faced difficulties such as
unforeseen technical problems and implementation lagging behind schedule.
This delaying factor has caused higher than anticipated costs and lower than
expected returns. While these problems are being gradually worked out
between BAMIN and the borrowers, the subprojects are nonetheless expected to
remain basically viable.
3.12      Although. many of the difficulties could not have been foreseen at
the time of the various subproject appraisals, some of them could have been
avoided by a more thorough subproject appraisal on the part of BANIN. It
should be noted that several of the smaller operations involved were able to
survive only because they were bought by medium mining companies.
3.13      In addition, most of the gold mining subprojects  which operate in
the form of cooperatives with up to 100 partners, utilize Inadecuate
processing and concentrating technologies, resulting in a high level of
losses (estimated by different sources as amounting to 40-502 of the
recoverable mineral amount). BAMIN had not, at the subproject appraisal
stage, provided the necessary technical advice for the selection of adequate
technology, nor has it at a later stage, provided technical assistance to
remedy the problem. Since BAMIN is, by law, the only collecting agency for
the gold mining proceeds in Bolivia, a much stronger interest in improved
recovery ratios should have been expected, which would have resulted in a
substantial increase of gold reserves to the Government.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
General
4.01      BAMIN was established in 1936, as an autonomous public institution,
to promote mining development in Bolivia. As an agency of MMM, it performs
two major functions: provision of credit and marketing of minerals, both
oriented to the small mining sector. Prior to the loan, BAMIN had a history
of inefficient operations and, in the past, its operations had often been
influenced bv political considerations, resulting in the deterioration of
its loan portfolio and its decapitalization.
6/ Twelve subprojects were visited, comprising 30% of the total number
of subborrowers, and 80X of the total subloan amounts.
7/   A separate consultant report includes an assessment of a sample of
subprojects.



-7-
4.02      In late 1972, the Government decided to rehabilitate BAMIN and
asked the Bank for assistance. Over the following three years, the Bank
maintained close contact with RAMIN's management and, as part of the project
preparation, provided it with technical and administrative advice. As a
result, several steps were taken to strengthen RAMIN's financial position and
organization. However, in spite of substantial improvements since 1973,
further financial and administrative adjustments were needed before BAMIN
could be able to establish itself as a financially sound and efficient
development credit institution. It was therefore agreed, for project
purposes, that BAMIN could start serving in a limited role as a channel for
Bank funds, mainly because, with some technical assistance, BAMIN was
expected to gradually develop satisfactory appraisal standard for mining
subprojects (Annex 6, para. 24). Considering the unique role of BAMIN in the
small mining sector and the Government's determination to strengthen BAMIN's
development banking function within the framework of the mining development
policies, the institution-building program was a key aspect of the project.
4.03      Following the Bank's involvement in the small mining sector through
this loan, BAMIN's performance began to improve slightly. Banking and
mineral warehousing functions were separated, long-term investment loans were
added to working capital and mediuw-term equipment financing, and external
audit and better appraisal standards were introduced.
4.04      However, in spite of some progress, the institution remained
undercapitalized, the loan portfolio continued to be poor, and the banking
function remained underdeveloped while BAMIN's management concentrated mainly
on buying and selling minerals through the trading department. At present,
BAMIN still needs to make substantial improvements, particularly in reducing
its loan arrears (para. 4.27), and in upgrading its financial planning and
controls (para.4.17); significant efforts toward institution-building
continue to be required.
Resources Mobilization and Operations
4.05      As a result of Loan 1331-RO, BAMIN was able to provide term lending
to the mining sector, in addition to working capital loans. Transactions
with medium-scale mining establishments have consequently increased. The
total lending orogram today includes loans for working capital, production
equipment and mining development, each with different terms and conditions.
4.06      During the period 1977-1981, BAMIN made about 2,700 loans for
b$ 715 million. Most of these loans were small, about 46% were in amounts
below $b 50,000 and only 5.2% exceeded $b 1.0 million. About 25% of the
loans were for working capital, 69% for production equipment loans, and 6%
for development project loans. About 90% of all loans were made to the small
mining subsector, including cooperatives, accounting for 92% of the total
loan amount; the remaining 8% was absorbed by 270 loans to medium miners. A
comparison within the five-year period shows that the lending pattern and
volume changed considerably, once the Bank-financed subprojects were under
way, toward larger subloans with greater emphasis on investment financing.



4.07      As of August 31, 1984, BAMIN had about US$5 million equivalent of
uncommitted resources from credits of Poland and the USSR available for new
development projects, to be utilized exclusively for the purchase of
machinery and equipment from these countries. In addition, RAMIN, together
with other participating financial intermediaries, has access to a US$35
million IDB line of credit (rediscounted through the Central Bank) available
for fixed asset and working capital financing in the mining sector.
4.08      BAMIN's inability to mobilize additional resources stems from:
(a) its poor loan recovery practices; (b) the overall deterioration of
country economic conditions, which limits the possibility of raising loans
from foreign commercial banks; (c) BAMIN's own low standing vis-a-vis
domestic financial institutions combined with a general lack of domestic term
funding; and (d) statutory limitations which do not allow BAMIN to take term
deposits from its credit and trade departments' clients.
4.09      These constraints are seriously limiting RAMIN's capability to
carry on a continuous-much less increased-lending program, and its credit
department has been practically inactive ever since Bank funds were
committed.
Management, Staffing and Organization
4.10      A reorganization process was started in 1972, upon the Rank's
recommendation, to separate the commercial activities from the banking
operations, and BAMIN was divided into two operational units, the Trading and
the Credit Departments, with capital resources being separated. In 1981, a
third operational unit was created the Finance and Administration
Department, which provides accounting and administrative services to the
other two departments.
4.11      As of December 1983, BAMIN employed a total staff of 523 (including
branches and field offices), of which only 31 were professionals. The Credit
Department has only four engineers and three economists at present. Two of
the economists handle the financial and economic snalysis of larger
subprojects, whereas small subprojects are reviewed solely by engineers who
have some background in financial analysis.
4.12      The Drofessional staff in La Paz has increased its technical
capacity, and its performance has been slowly but steadily improving over the
period of the loan. However, the department's capability to adequately carry
out the appraisal and supervision work involved in the loan operations has
been constrained by the limited number of professionals, as well as a strong
union inside BAMIN which continues to resist any outside appointments, making
it very difficult to hire new qualified staff and to manage recruitment on a
professional basis.
4.13      Management turnover has been verv high (BAMIN has had five general
managers over the past three years), with a negative impact on staff morale
ana on the continuity of personnel and administrative policies.



-9-
4.14                In summary, there have been some improvements in BAMIN's
staffing and organizational structure, but major difficiencies still persist,
and the strengthening of staffing (both quantitative and qualitative) and
managerial capability as well as managerial continuity continue to be
required.
Systems and Procedures
4.15      Appraisal and Supervision.  Considering that hardly any appraisal
work existed before, the quality of BAMIN's subproject appraisals has
gradually improved over the period of the loan. However, some appraisals are
still not fully satisfactory, sometimes failing to address relevant technical
or financial-economic issues specifically. SuDervision is being carried out
through a special division in the Credit Department. Because of inadequate
staffing and budget resources, supervision activities are seriously
constrained. Only four vehicles and five staff were available in the central
La Paz office for coordinating and partly carrying out field supervision.
This existing situation is not compatible with the large loan portfolio under
implementation, and it has resulted in cases in which some borrowers have not
been visited for more than a year, even though additional supervision staff
is available in the field offices.
4.16      Procurement and Disbursement.  BAMIN's procurement and disbursement
procedures have been satisfactory.'/ BAMIN requires its clients to obtain
quotations from at least three suppliers. Loan funds are disbursed by
issuing a check directly to the local supplier or by arranging for direct
payment abroad for equipment imported by its clients.
4.17      Financial Reporting.  As required under the loan, separate
financial statements for BAMIN's Credit and Commercial Departments have been
prepared annually.  However, such statements have basically been prepared
to mechanically fulfill a loan condition, rather than to create a needed
operational management tool which could have provided an independent
assessment and control of costs, operations, funding and profits/losses.
This type of reporting was especially recommended because the profitable
warehousing operations9/ are included in the Credit Department and its
profits offset the continuous losses incurred by lending operations. With
constant changes in managerial positions, several incumbent finance managers
indicated to supervision missions that they were unaware of a separation of
financial statements, and such information had to be prepared retroactively
(by assigning costs and revenues to the pertinent operations after the
overall statements had been prepared).
4.18      Auditing.  BAMIN's operations have been subject to external
auditing only since 1975. Different auditors have been contracted every year
because of a regulation which requires the auditing contract to be awarded to
8j Apart from tIne fact that the former manager of finance has been indicted
of wrong doing. The court case is still pending.

the lowest bidder. It would have been such more beneficial to both auditor
and BANIN if there had been more continuity in the annual auditors'
assessments and recommendations.
4.19      Loan Administration and Controls. BANIN does not have in place a
suitable system to monitor loans. Its recording and followup of overdue
loans, and the related loan recovery procedures, are inadequate. Information
on loan arrears has been incomplete and not up-to-date, and a clear arrears
position has usually not been available to management.
4.20      Only now, following continuous recommendations from several Bank
supervision missions, has BAMIN's management finally agreed to carry out a
special portfolio audit at a cost of US$91,050, financed under the loan.
Once completed, this special audit could provide the basis for a corrective
action program.
Financial Performance
4.21      Financial and Operational Status.  The following assessment is
restricted to BAMIN's Credit Department, which is financially independent
from the Trading Department, and which was responsible for channeling the
loan proceeds.
4.22      Total assets of rhe Credit Department exDanded significantly, in
dollar terms, between 1977 and 1983, having increased by 3.4 times in
relation to 1977. This increase was due to an expansion of total outstanding
loans (which augmented 2.3 times) and, more important, to an even larger
increase in the value of inventories carried by the warehouse operation
(which increased 3.9 times).  The loan increases were funded mainly by the
Bank loan, credits from Poland and the USSR for the purchase of machinery and
equipment, and increases in resources provided by or through the Central
Bank.
4.23      The debt/equity ratio varied between 3.1:1 and 3.6:1 in the period
1977-1981, well below the 4:1 limit agreed to under the loan. Equity
increased by 38Z to USS8 million at the end of 1981. In 1982, however,
due to dedollarization- policies implemented by the Government, BAMIN's
Credit Department suffered heavy currency devaluation losses (to be
capitalized over a four-year period), which had a substantial negative impact
upon equity, which was reduced to USS1.7 million. BAMIN as a whole, however,
has not incurred losses, since its consolidated balance sheet also reflected
exchange gains of the Trading Department derived from the increased valuation
of its inventories due to exchange rate changes. New loan regulations,
effective since early 1983, provide that all of BAMIN's loans will be
denominated in foreign currency or have a maintenance of value clause. Thus,
RAMIN's Credit Department will not be exposed further to any significant
foreign exchange risk in its operations since funds are lent out either in
the same currency in which they were obtained or are lent out under a
maintenance of value clause.



- 11 -
4.24      At the same time that the Credit Department's equity suffered such
negative impact, total liahilities increased significantly from US$24.0
million on December 31, 1981 to US58.4 million on December 31, 1982 and to
US$89.9 million on December 31, 1983. This increase was mainly caused by an
expansion of the use of foreign loans (IBRD, Russian and Polish credits, IDB)
and by a substantial increase in liabilities and provisions related to the
warehouse operations (for replenishment of inventories, unrealized sales and
profits and foreign exchange variations). As a consequence, and directly
linked to the eauity erosion as stated previously, the debt/equity ratio
increased to an extremely high level of 35:1 in 1982 and even further to 78:1
in 1983.Currently, there are no indications that the Government will increase
equity funds to strengthen RAMIN's eroded capital structure.
4.25      Profitability.   The Lending Operations Division of the Credit
Department had losses every year throughout the lifetime of the loan, except
in 1980.  Rowever, these losses were more than offset by profits from the
warehouse operation, which is, for accounting purposes, also included in the
Credit Department. Therefore, for the Credit Department as a whole, the
overall net profits over equity were very low, but still positive during the
period 1977-1979 (1.2%, 3.0% and 0.7%), and increased in subsequent years
(34.5% in 1980, 5.8Z in 1981, 13.4% in 1982 and 24.0% in 1983).
Loan Portfolio
4.26      Administrative costs followed an inconsistent pattern,
alternatively increasing and decreasing as a percentage of average total
assets (having varied between 1.6% and 6.1% of average total assets).
Over the 1978-1983 period, the level of arrears was very high. Principal
affected by arrears varied between 24% and 40% of total loans. Between 1978
and 1981, the affected total principal increased by 56% from US$5.1 million
to US$8.0 million. In 1982, however, it decreased to USS6.1 million,
increasing again to US$7.9 million in 1983. As of December 31, 1983, 40% of
BAMIN's loan portfolio was affected by arrears (RAHIN defines a loan as in
arrears once a borrower is overdue on three repayments). The breakdown of
arrears by credit lines indicates that, if it were not for the Bank loan with
25% in arrears, the overall ratio of arrears would have been higher than 40%
since the loan arrears of various other credit lines average about 52%. Only
the forthcoming detailed portfolio review will provide a more realistic
assessment of the actual status of the many loans ia arrears since BAMIN
itself was unable to undertake suclh a review. A detailed breakdown of loan
arrears is shown in Annex 3.
4.27      The high levels of arrears have been due to (a) recurrent problems
in the mining subsectors (e.g., high operational cost, low recovery ratios
and low international price levels for tin); (b) specific problems in some
enterprises (e.g., low demand and low historical vrices for some minerals,
transport difficulties and labor problems), and (c) poor collection and
inadequate loan supervision by BAMIN. In addition, collection is hindered by
delays in the judicial system in processing court cases and by political
pressure from strong mining unions.



- 12 -
4.28      BAMIN has never made a detailed analysis of its loan portfolio, and
it is not possible to state with accuracy the number of bad loans, nor what
should be the proper level of provisions for doubtful accounts. In addition,
the rescheduling of several loans over the past two to three years has
further prevented a clear assessment of the arrears position. After
continuous recommendations from the Bank, BAMIN has hired independent
auditors to carry out an internal portfolio review, which is to include an
analysis of all overdue loans, outstanding loan amounts affected by arrears,
and an analysis of arrears by credit line, branch office, and age. Findings
of this review will serve as a basis for determining the adequacy of
provisions for doubtful loans, the extent of loans to be written off and
other corrective actions.
V. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENTS
Introduction I0/
5.01      Even though formally divided into two projects, the TA of loan
1331-BO was a natural continuation of the TA under Credit 455-BO; the two
are, therefore, for practical purposes, evaluated as one single operation.
5.02      The overall objective of both TA components was to assist Bolivia
in the development of the small-scale mining sector and to improve the
efficiency of several public mining institutions, such as MMM, GEOBOL and
BAMIN, through the implementation of seven main TA components: (a) the
survey of small mines, (b) the strengthening of MMK, (c) a sector tax system
study, (d) a mineral resources exploration fund study, (e) a review of the
Mining Code, (f) the cadastral survey, and (g) the strengthening of BAMIN.
5.03      These TA components were implemented only partially and resulted in
a mixture of failures and successes. A good portion of the TA under Credit
455-BO was implemented satisfactorily and resulted in some successes, whereas
the more complex TA components under Loan 1331-BO proved to be a failure.
They had too many overly ambitious objectives.  Responsibilities for
implementation were only loosely defined and assigned to different agencies
under the overall coordination of MMM. The project had a successful
start but suffered from lack of political support and continuous changes in
executing personnel. Poor coordination resulted in serious
misunderstandings, overlapping of functions, and disputes among the
institutions.
5.04      Since IDA Credit 455-RO was negotiated, a total of 12 individuals
have held the office of Minister of Mining and Metallurgy, averaging more
than one change per year.
5.05      Some TA components, such as the sector tax study, the survey of
small mines, and the study which led to the creation of the National
Exploration Fund, have had a significant impact in planning the strategy for
10/ For a full description of the TA components, refer to Annex 6.

future development of the sector. Other technical assistance components
were only partially implemented. MMM and GEOBOL's original plans to hire
about 20 consultants for strengthening their capabilities were considerably
reduced in number and scope, thus limiting the success of these components.
The commitment to review and promulgate a new Mining Code was not fulfilled.
VI. CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
6.01      The overall impact of the loan has been positive as far as
subproject financing is involved. Most subprojects utilized the loan
resources well and were able to modernize and/or expand their operations.
Regarding specific subloans in the gold mining sector, the lack of technical
assistance caused most gold mining cooperatives to utilize inadequate
processing and concentrating technologies, resulting in poor recovery and
high mineral losses. In addition, inadequate pricing policies and
insufficient funding from the Central Bank during certain periods seriously
limited BAMIN's ability to purchase the gold production from the miners,
which resulted in increased sales through unofficial channels. This
situation, combined with the high level of mineral losses, had a significant
negative impact in limiting the potential benefits to the economy, in terms
of lower recorded outputs and lower additions to the gold reserves held by
the Central Rank.
6.02      The project has not achieved one other of its major objectives:
BAMIN's institutional development.  There have been a few improvements in
BAMIN's organizational structure, appraisal capability and accounting
procedures, but BAMIN has not been able to evolve into a more modern,
efficient banking organization. Its overall performance has been weak. High
management turnover led to inconsistent policies and poor staff morale. It
still has insufficient qualified staff and lacks physical resources such as
adequate central office snace and vehicles. BAMIN's supervision activities
continue to be uncoordinated, and it has not provided adequate technical
assistance to its borrowers (e.g., to improve gold recovery and minimize
losses). BAMIN's financial performance has been poor. Because of foreign
exchange losses and poor collection practices, its ecuity has eroded
substantially. In addition, its arrears position has worsened. Financial
controls are inadequate, loan administration remains deficient and monitoring
and followup action on arrears have not been carried out on a systematic
basis. Also, the envisaged separation of trading and lending operations 'a
not been fully achieved at the operational level. Finally, BAMIN's resource
mobilization capability has not been developed, limiting its ability to
carry on efficiently and to expand its lending operations. Bank supervision
missions have repeatedly raised and discussed BAMIN's deficiencies with
Government officials and BAMIN's management. However, there has been little
corrective action, and relevant policies and/or procedures have not been
changed or improved.

Lessons Learned
6.03      The project goal of gradually transforming small mining units with
development potential into efficient mining enterprises was, in retrospect,
too ambitious a task. The specific objective of developing some 20
preselected small mining operations through the provision of supervised
credit with complementary technical assistance proved to be too inflexible.
Because of loan effectiveness delays, none of the preselected mines actually
received Bank funds. Also, the separation of subproject preparation (through
GEOBOL) from actual financing and supervision (through BAMIN) was not
effective because of the lack of coordination between the two entities.
6.04      As a result of the above-stated shortcomings, a change in focus
became inevitable. Fifty percent of the loan proceeds, finally went to
rather healthy medium mining entities, which were normally clients of the
private Ranco Industrial, S.A. (RISA). The timing of the loan was such that
BISA had committed all of its Bank funds while RAMIN still had a large part
of the Bank loan uncommitted. The miners and BAMIN reluctantly agreed to
accept each other, which substantially helped to commit the loan. Setting a
strict limit to subproject size might have prevented this substantial change.
6.05      Regarding institutional development, the expectation that RAMTN
could be transformed into a sound mining bank relied heavily upon the
provision of technical assistance to that institution. However, neither
form of assistance--a long-term consultant contract and a short-term revision
of procedures contract-had any lasting effect, mostly because of the many
personnel changes throughout the time of the loan in MMM, and in BANIN
itself. Ten different ministers and seven general managers could not provide
the continuity necessary to implement the changes that were suggested.
Tn additon to the fact that no member of RAMIN's higher management had ever
had professional banking experience, the strong unions inside BAMIN, which
forbid any outside appointments above a certain level inhibited any major
change of professional attitude. If this situation had been foreseen more
realistically, stronger loan conditions might have been established, allowing
for loan suspension. Otherwise, it should have been made clear that
expectations of change were very limited and that the project would be
considered satisfactory as long as funds were channeled effectively to the
small mining sector. This alternative, however, would not have been
acceptable because aid to the small mining sector in Bolivia involves
effective supervision, provision of technical assistance and an overall
adequate sector framework as well as the effective channeling of funds.
6.06      Whenever TA components complemeLLt a project, it is essential to
coordinate the various activities involved. In the case under review, it
would probably have been best to center the responsibility for coordination
within the institution to which the major share of funds was allocated. If
ministers change ten times, however, within the course of a project, a
continuation of coordination cannot reasonably be expected.

Recommendations
6.07      Considering the weak financial and organizational situation of
BAMIN, future loans to the mining sector should preferably also include other
qualified financial intermediaries, such as BISA, as has been envisaged in a
preliminary appraisal report for a potential Fourth Mining Credit Project.
In addition to diminishing the risk factor, this approach would provide the
participating institutions with an opportunity to compete with each other.
The competitive aspect would potentially result in a more effective handling
of loan applications by the participating banks and in better arrangements
for meeting the borrowers' financial and technical assistance needs.
6.08      In order for BAMIN to be included in future lending operations, its
capital structure would have to be strengthened substantially by a Government
equity contribution. A revaluation of its assets would have to be
recommended, and additional institutional strengthening would be required.
6.09      Within the Credit Department, separate costs and income allocation
for the warehousing and lending operations should be enforced more strictly.
A more adequate accounting system and improved financial controls should be
established to permit an accurate, independent assessment for proper
management action related to the covmercial and lending operations.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA - SMALL SCALE MINING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1331-RO)
Public (Large) Mining
1.        All large mines are owned and managed by COMIBOL   Rowever, COMIBOL
is beset by serious problems resulting from excessive taxation, overcentra-
lization, difficult labor relations, high costs and low efficiency. Over the
years, under pressure from the central government and organized labor,
substantial amounts have been spent on social welfare, while essential
operational and maintenance expenditures have been neglected. Only recently
have there been some new investments in mine development and ore processing,
the latter resulting in increased recovery rates and higher concentration
despite a declining metal content of ores. In general, COMIBOL's operating
costs exceed those of the private medium mines. The government is seeking
long-term solution to COMIBOL's problems, involving unpopular political
decisions, and has requested technical and financial assistance from the
Bank. As a preliminary step, MNDP has financed a diagnostic study of COMIBOL
for which the Bank was the executing agency. However, COMIROL's management
has not yet agreed upon an action program to carry out the study's
recowmendations.
Medium Mining 1,. This subsector consists of some 24 private
companies, some with foreign interest participation. They represent the most
efficient segment of the sector, and are responsible for about 80% of the
Bolivian production (volume) of antimony, 50% of tungsten and 40% of zinc,
while their production share of tin and lead exceeds 20%.
1/ The main legal requisites for a private mining company to be classified
as a medium mining operation are the following: ti) the company should
have a minimum level of production, which in the case of tin is 5,500
fine kilos of tin in concentrates per month; (ii) it should have a
paid-in capital of at leest USS100,000; (iii) it sbould have a minimum of
one mining engineer and one accountant on a full-time basis; and (iv) it
should be registered with the Association of Medium Miners.  However, in
the absence of strict enforcement, classification as a medium miner
depends more on the individual mine owner's choice. There are perceived
advantages in being classified as a medium-miaer, such as better access
to credit and possibility of being able to export directly, instead of
being forced to sell to ENAF or to BAMIN. However, some tax advantages
and less exacting accounting requireaents encourage the marginal cases to
continue as small miners.

Annex 5

Small Mining. A small mining Inventory conducted by GEOBOL under
IDA Credit 455-BO identified 5,240 mining properties of which about 2,000 to
4,000 are in operation; the actual number depending on the level of
international metal prices. About two-thirds of small operating mines are
producing tin and the subsector is responsible for about 10-15% of mining
production.  Small mining operations vary in size from one family and
Dart-time activities to enterprises comparable in output andt employment to
smaller m-edium mines. Some small miners are organized in cooperatives, often
working under marginal conditions.
In general, small mines L)perations utilize primitive technology,
have low productivity and carry out little or no exploration. Business
records, if any, are poor. Normally, only the richest and most easily
accessible portions of deposits are exploited, often in a way which makes the
later use of more advanced techniques more difficult or impossible. The
major deficiencies of small mines are low level of technology, poor
management, and little or no capital. The problem is compounded because
small mines are widely dispersed over Bolivia's geographically difficult
terrain and because they mostlv produce tin, for which demand has not been
strong and prices low, and complex minerals which are costly to recover.
Income levels, health and safety standards in small mines are usually very
low. Some small mines can be developed and become financially viable once a
significant injection of financial resources and technical assistance is
provided. Development of such potentially efficient units calls for
sustained assistance in exploration, mine planning and development,
investment financing, and in improved processing of ore to minimize loss of
mineral values. However, many small mines are too small or have too poor ore
reserves to justify additional investment and will either disappear, be
merged into larger units or continue as subsistence family units.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA - SMALL SCALE MINING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1331-BO)
Technical Assistance Components
A.  Introduction
1.        Thia is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the technical
assistance components of the following two projects: (i) the Mining Credit
Project for which IDA Credit 455-BO in the amount of USS6.2 million was
approved in January 15, 1974; and (ii) the Small-Scale Mining nevelopment
Project for which Bank Loan 1331-BC in the amount of USS12.0 million was
approved in September 21, 1976. Even though formally divided into two
projects, the technical assistance of Loan 1331-BO was a natural
continuation of the technical assistance of Credit 455-10; therefore, they
are evaluated for practical purposes as one single operation.
2.        Closing Aates of Credit 455-B0 and Loan 1331-BO were June 30,
1981 and December 31, 1982 respectively. On July 1984, IND staff visited
Bolivia and had discussions with officials of the Ministry of Mines and
Metallurgy (MMM), the Bolivia Mining Rank (BAMIN), the Geological Survey
(GEOBOL) and other entities involved in the implementation of the TA
components. The report reflects the findings of this mission, which also
Included a consultant, Mr. A. de Urioste, as well as the review of project
files and related documents.
3.        The overall objective-was to assist Bolivia in the development of
the small mining sector and improve efficiency of Public mining
institutibns such as the MMM, GEOBOL, and PAMIN, through the implementation
of seven main T.A. components: Ci) the survey of small mines, (ii) the
strengthening of the MMM, (iii) a sector tax system study, (iv) a mineral
resources exploration fund study, (v) review of the Mining Code, (vi) the
cadastral survey, and (vii) the strengthening of BAMIN.
4.        These TA components were implemented only Partially and resulted
in a mixture of failures and successes. A good portion of the TA under
Credit 455-BO was satisfactorily implemented and resulted in some successes
whereas the TA components under Loan 1331-BC, having had a more complex
concept proved to be a failure.  They consisted of too many overly
ambitious objectives. Responsibilities for implementation were only
loosely defined and assigned to particular agencies under the overall
coordination of the MMK. The project had a successful start but suffered
from lack of support, and continuous changes in executive personnel. Poor
coordination resulted in serious misunderstandings, overlapping of
functions, and disputes even among the institutions.

Annex 6
Page 2of t8
5.        Since IDA credit 455-BO was negotiated, a total of twelve
individuals have held the office of Minister of Mining and Metallurgy, an
average of more than one per year.
6.        Some T.k. components such as the sector tax study, the survey of
small sines, and the study which led to the creation of the National
Exploration Pund, have had a significant impact in planning the strategy
for future development of the sector. Other technical assistance
components again were only partially implemented. NMM and GEOB0L's
original plans to hire about 20 consultants for strengthening of their
capabilities, were considerably reduced in number and scope, thus limiting
the success of these components. The commitment to review and promulgate a
new Mining Code was not fulfilled.
B.  Tsrgets and Goals
The following were the specific main targets and goals:
Credit 455-Bo
(i) In GEOBOL: the implementation by the Republic of Bolivia,
through GEOBOL, of a survey of small minesl' designed to take an
inventory of all small-scale mining operations in the country, to
select the mines with best potential for further development, to
provide technical and exploration assistance to mine owners. and
to determine optimal location for regional concentration plants.
(ii) In the Ministry of Mines and Metallurgy: the implementation by
the Republic of Bolivia, through the MM of the following:
the streng-t of the NMM's planning, documentation, and
supervision functions including the review of existing marketing
policies, a study of the mineral sector's tax system, a study of
the feasibility of establishing a mineral resources exploration
fund in Bolivia, and a review of the Mining Code.
Loan 1331-BO
(U) In GEOBOL: continuation of the survey of small mines, and
strengthening of GEOBOL's capability to prepare pre-feasibility
studies of small-scale mining projects.
(il) In the Ministry of Mines and Metallurgy: continuation of
the strengthening of the 1MM, and a cadastral survey of the
mining concession areas in the country.
(iii) In the Bolivia Mining Bank: assistance to BAMIN, strengthening
its project appraisal and supervision capability and improving
its management control systems.
1/ Snsll mines are defined by law as those mines with a production of less
than 5,500 kilos of tin per month.

C.  Project Cost and Disbursements
7.        A total of US$4.2 mllion was originally allocated for technical
assistance; US$1.2 million under Credit 455-30 and US$3.0 million under
Loan 1331-BO. The distribution of funds between GEOBOL and MNE was as
follows:
Original Allocation of Funds
(US$ million)
Credit    Loan
Technical Assistance to:   455-BO   1331-BO   Total
GEOBOL                0.850      1.900    2.750
EMU and BAMIN          0.350     1.100    1.450
Total       1.200      3.000    4.200
8.        At closing dates, total disbursements of Credit 455-BO and Loan
1331-BO were as follows:
Actual Disbursements
(US$ million)
Credit     Loan
455-B0   1331-BO   Total
GEOBOL         0.850      1.275    2.125
NMI            0.350      0.725    1.075
Total    1.200     2.000    3.200
There was no cancellation of funds that could be used for technical
assistance, but US$1.0 million of unused funds by GEOBOL and MMM were
transferred to BAMIN for lending.
D.  Project Implementation and Results
9.        Survey of Small Mines by GEOBOL. Early in the implementation of
this T.A. component under Credit 455-BO, the scope was found overambitious
and the necessity for more specific and realistic goals was recognized.  To
visit around 12,000-15,000 mines and mineral outcrops in a three-to-four
years period, to write a report for each visit, and to prepare
prefeasibility studies of the most promising mines was an unrealistic
target. Awareness of these facts, together with delays encountered in the
procurement of equipment and materials, problems in the contracting of
consultants, and changes in GEOBOL's personnel led to a new set of
objectives which were incorporated in the scope of the technical assistance
program under Loan 1331-BO.



31                         Annex6
Page 6 of 8
10.       The work advanced by CEOBOL under credit 455--o wms regarded by
the Bark's appraisal mission of Loan 1331-D0 as a virtually completed first
phase of the survey. An operating unit bad been established within GEODOL,
the necessary manpower was organized, most of the equipment was in
oper-'ion and a number of orefeasibility studies had been completed.
11.       Once the vroject continued under loan 1331-B0, the lack of
coordination between GEOBOL and 13A)I became the nost serious constraint
for implementation2/. BANIN which was to finance the projects uroposed by
GEOBOL, claimed they were poorlv prepared and the prefeasibility studies
too academic, mainly because of GEOBOLXs initial limited experience3f. In
addition, CFOBOL was not able to generate enough projects to keep fAHMD's
lending rhytht4/. In mid 1980 the Government decided that GEOPOL should
limit its activity to the basic survey of mines and that BA2IY should
finance the preparation of the prefeasibilitv studies done by the miners
and assist in the financing of successful prolects. As a consequence,
GEOROL transferred to BAMIW, for relending, USS625,000 of the uncommitted
balance of funds originally allocated to the survey of small mines. BRANI
considerably reduced the scope of the studies and used the funds to finance
equipment and development works for projects which were bankable, coverlng
a whole range of mining companies in the small mining sector. However, in
spite of the difficulties, there was some positive outcome of this
component, since it enabled GEOBOL to acquire experience and to train some
professionals in formulation and appraisal of mining projects 3/.
12.       Another original objective of the survey was to determine the
optimal location of regional concentrators. This objective was abandoned
due to the lack of institutional capability to administer such a program.
13.       Four consultants to assist in the areas of economic geology, mine
organization and administration, geophysics, and drilling operations were
never contracted. After long negotiations with a consulting firm a
preliminary agreement was reached at the working level. However, final
approval bv Government had been continuously delayed, because of the
government's concern about the cost and because GEOROL was receiving
assistance of two experts provided, at no coat, under a West German
Government technical assistance program. Because of the extensive delay,
the consultant decided to withdraw the vroposal5/. The unused funds
(USS375,noo) were then transferred to BAMIN for general lending purposes.
2/ This is also reflected in the comments received fron the Rorrower
(Comment 1, Attachment).
3/ As also indicated in Borrower's comment 4 (Attachnent).
4/ GEOBOL attributes the  delay in preparing feasibility studies to
factors bevond its control (Borrower's Cowment 2, Attachment) and to
the fact that mining enterprises were not in a Position to finance the
high cost of private consultants to carry out surh studies. (Borrower's
Comment 6, Attachment).
5/ This is referred to in Borrower's Cominent 3 (Attachment), which however
does not provide the background.

ViFe 75 of a
14.       At the time of the PCR mission, GEOBOL had completed a general
survey of more than 5,000 mines in the Oruro, Potosi and La Paz regions.
Full survey reports on 600 mines with economic potential have been
completed and are accessible to 1MM, interested private entrepreneurs as
well as to financial institutions such as BAHIN and the National
Exploration Fund.
Strengthening of the MMM
15.       The technical assistance to the MMM consisted of three
sub-programs:
-    to establish a documentation center and to institute a system
for miniug sector data gathering and control;
-    to strengthen the Ministry's existing project evaluation and
planning unit; and
-    to review the existing marketing policies.
16.       The Documentation Center at the MM4  was implemented and
successfully started to provide the services for which it was created.
Lack of support, budgetary limitations, and frequent changes in personnel
have resulted in that, at present, the Center has very little to offer; the
sophisticated equipment financed by the project is rarely used, the
documents received are not orderly filed, the information available is
generally outdated, subscriptions to technical magazines have, in practice,
been suspended. Important documents such as the Tax Studies and the recent
Rehabilitation Plan of COKIBOL were found missing at the time of the PCR
mission.
17.       The strengthening of the MM1's project evaluatio.- and planning
capability, under Credit 455-BO, was supposed to be 'mplemented by
contracting six foreign consultants to assist MM  in the following areas:
planning, project preparation, administration, financial analysis,
marketing, and statistics. The program was postponed and reconsidered
later in Loan 1331-BO; the consultants were not contracted. Under Loan
1331-BO, the MMM hired the consultants for strengthening planning
capability; however, severe criticisms were made regarding -ae
effectiveness of the training provided and the contract was cancelled. At
present, there are no signs of the training left and the lack of expertise
in planning and other areas is evident. Consultants for other areas were
never contracted.
Minerals Sector Tax System Study
18.       This study was aimed to determine:
-    The extent of inequities in the existing system;
-    The relative tax burden carried by the mining sector vis-a-vis
other sectors in Bolivia, and vis-a-vis mining in other
countries;
-    The practicality of instituting alternative systems; if deemed
required; and
-    A program for implementing changes in the system.



- 33 -
Annex 6
Page 6 of 8
19.       In general terms this component was implemented without major
changes and is considered a successful one. The study represents an
important contribution to a better understanding of the dining industry.
It has created an awareness Y moug policy makers about the Importance of
mining taxation, bas presented and taught an excellent methodology to
handle tax problems and provided the basis for gradual changes in the tax
system. Already some changes, such as the introduction of production costs
In the calculation of the presumed cost-6/ have been introduced; however,
lack of standard accounting systems mainly in the small mnting sector and
serious Administrative limitations is hampering the implementation of other
recommendations made, such as the indexation of the presumed cost and a
gradual change to a tax system based on net income.
Mnleral Resources Exploration Fund Study
20.       The first feasibility study for the impl~nentation of an
exploration fund, contracted with a foreign consultant, was found to be far
below the intended scope of work and therefore, of no use for
implementation. The Minifstry had to contract, at its own expense, a local
consultant to conduct a new study. This second study was completed early
in 1977 and led to the creation of the National Fund for Xining Exploration
(FUND). To support the operation of the FUND, an IDA credit (940-B0) in
the amount of US$7.5 million was approved in June 1979.
Review of the Mining Code
21.       The Government did not fulfill its commitment to review and
promulgate a new Mining Code which was a contractual condition under IDA -
Credit 455-30. It appears that high officials of the MMK. at the time of
the credit negotiations, had the intention to review the code and suggested
the contractual conditions to be included in the legal documents; later on,
the MMI, after consultation with interested parties within the public and
private mining sector, found that a review of the code was not necessary
and decided not to change it. The existing Mining Code has some
bureaucratic and administrative weaknesses but in essence is a good one and
requires no major review.
The Cadastral Survey
22.       The survey was aimed at compiling an official register of all
mining concessions in the country thus providing an important tool for
policy making and, in particular, for the introduction of a new tax
system. A well staffed technical unit was established in the MMH and
successfully initiated the program, but poor supervision by MMK, lack of
adequate budget contributions, strong opposition from mine owners and
irregularities in the administration of the cadastral unit, led to the
indefinite postponement of the program in 1982. Information was obtained
that several pieces of equipment and instruments were lost or stolen from
the unit. The survey so far completed only about 5Z of the original target
in an area which proved to be of little value for the mining industry.
6/ Bolivian tax on mineral production is based on the royalties paid on
the difference between the metal price and the -presumed cost- set by
the Government.



- 34 -
Annex 6
Page 7 of 8
23.       On the positive side, a good number of surveyors have been
trained which, under new favorable circumstances, could lead to the
continuation of this program.
Strengthening of BAMTN
24.       The principal objective of this T.A. component was to hbap the
Technical Office of BAMIN in appraising and supervising sub-loans for
mining development. The improvement of BAMIN's managerial control system
was also considered. In 1977 a foreign consultant in mineral economics was
hired under this program. Lack of receptiveness prevented the consultant
from effectively communicating and motivating the local team and his
services were cancelled.
25.       An international management consulting company performed an
extensive study of BAMIN's operations and made several recomuendations for
improvements. In practice, none of the recommendations have been
implemented. Similar to the turnover of Ministers in ME, BAMIN had on
average, one new General Manager per year.
E.   Government Participation
26.       The MHM was charged with the overall responsibility of the
project, had to assure coordination among the participting agencies,
oversee the progress of the individual project components, administer the
technical assistance contracts for its planning office, and carry out the
cadastral survey.
- -.     n~t the time of appraisal and during the initial steps of proj-_t
implementation, the country was in the middle of an exceptional period of
political stability and the Ministry was staffed with a highly motivated
team of professionals who were agressively pursuing the development of the
project. Later on, significant political changes and the departure of
highly motivated staff hampered successful project implementation. Failure
of the Government to provide the necessary funds such as those required to
complete GEOBOL's laboratory and workshops, and implement the cadastral
survey, can also be considered as reasons for the unsuccessful termination
of the various programs.
F. Bank's Role
28.          Main Bank contribution has been Ln the conception of the
technical assistance to the sector which was badly needed to assist Bolivia
in the understanding of the mining industry, in particular, the small and
medium mines subsector.
29.      On the negative side, the Bank failed to recognize the limitations
of institutions such as GEOBOL which, due to the nature of its activities
is oriented mainly to the prospecting of new ore deposits and to the
preparation of technical, geological studies. It is not prepared however,
to make full prefeasibility studies as it was expected to do.

Annex 6
Page 8 of 8
G. Lessons Learned
30.      Most important lessons learned about project design and
implemuentation can be summarized as follows:
-   Project design was not clearly defined nor widely discussed with
the borrower during the initial steps of preparation.
Responsibilities among implementation agencies were not clearly
determined resulting in complex coordination schemes for
supervision.
-   Poor implementation or cancellation of some of the T.A. comnonents
could have been avoided by concentration on short-term, clearly
designed targets within an overall medium- to long-term strategy.
-   The design of the assistance through foreign consultants, financed
by loan funds, did not take into consideration the limited
capacity and lack of receptiveness of some local entities and the
ability of the consultants to transfer their experience in an
environment with limited facilities constant political changes,
and strong resistance to foreigners7/. In this respect,
short-term consultants to assist in very specific tasks have shown
positive results while long stays to assist in long-term goals of
staff improvement and planning, have not worked out as expected.
-   The fact that GEOROL failed to produce the pre-feasibility
studies as required and that BAMTN, with a more straight forward
a-pproach, was able to disburse and finance mining projects,
indicate that the original conception was probably too academic.
-   Finally, despite the fact that the Bank put considerable human
resources into supervision, poor coordination by MMM, lack of
political and managerial continuity and institutional weaknesses,
made it difficult to implement the agreements reached during
project implementation.
ALeonIK25a;PCRBolivia
7/ GEOBOL's view, however, is that, it. its case, foreign technical
assistaiwce was used whenever consultants were available. (Borrower's
Cc nent 5, Attachment).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLrVIA - SMALL SCALE WINING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1331-BO) and (CREDIT 455-BO)
Selected Subproject Visits
Visit to Martha Project
This open pit project shows an impressive display of modern earth moving and
ore processing equipment. Rowever, it is still loosing money. Rock hardness
proved to be higher than expected, so, the huge dragline is unable to scoop
sufficient ore to the washing plant. In addition, there are problems with an
inadequate supply of water.
Although BAMIN's technical staff seemed to overplay the soundness of this
project, it was clear from our visit that the company is behind schedule and
that the break-even point is still a way ahead. In order to solve these
problems, two Caterpillars are being put to help loosen the rock and a
tailings pond is still under construction to serve the purpose of recycling
water.
There is no doubt that these problems will eventually be solved; the company
is one of the most experienced medium mining companies in Bolivia and its
financial voundness will back its obligations with BAMIN. Rowever, this is a
point in case, raising the question regarding BAMIN's ability to evaluate
these type of projects. It should be remembered that the credit was given to
Martha, when it was still in the hands of a small miner. Comsur bought 50Z
of the shares, after financing had been secured and it had to put in a
substantial amount of its own funds in order to implement the project. Fo,
the question arises, what would have happened if Coasur had not entered into
this proiect?
From my enjovable experience working with your mission in evaluating the
outcome of Projects 455-RO and 1331-BO, I reached the conclusion that BAMIN
displayed a lot of pragmatism in departing from the original small mining
project oriented philosophy of its loan program, but in doing so, it also
entered into substantial risks.
3. Visit to Cia. Minera Tianacu Ltda.
This company is one of the most aggressive mining company in the country at
present and is dynamically pursuing expansion into new ventures. Its
progressive spirit is also demonstrated by its willingness to test new
technologies in the mineral processing field.
Here again, BAldIN's loan was a sound investment and was oriented more to the
type of client than to the tvpe of project.

4. Visit to CAMBIA
I can say very little about this company and this project. The time spent in
the mine premises was too short to get better acquainted with the people
involved in this operation. At a first glance, however, it was possible to
recognized, in contrast with Hartha next door, a highly labor intensive
operation and, therefore, a richer tin deposit. I understand that this
company is doing very well and that again here, BAMIN may have taken a sound
decision.
5. Conclusions
I would dare the impression that all companies visited were solid credit
subjects and that BANIN lent them money mainly because of their
credituorthiness, and not necessaril7 because of the project's own merits.
From the documents that you gave me to study I perceived that BAMIN's
technical and financial appraisal of the prolects was rather weak.
This type of practive may be vractical, provided the sub3ect is very sound,
reliable, and offering a good proportion of collateral. However, it can be a
very risky practice with lesser credit sublects. It is interesting to note
that in any case, it is a large departure from the original target of the
loan program, that was to -help improve the small mining industry.- Or may
be, it would be better to say that such original target was not realistic, if
it had to become an end in itself, departing from sound banking practices.

Dear Sir:
I vrite to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 15. and to
expras" our partial concurrnce with the Project Completion Report (Credit
1331-40). -Nevrtheless, a few points require some clarificatioc, and I attach
the pertinent cauMmts. insofar an GEOBOL is concerned, for consideration in
-our final report.
Yours truly,

1.  The PCI metions "disputes' betwee  GEONOL and 1M.
Para. 11,
Annex 6 and W mould point out that disputes as *uch did not arise; there vas a
footnote 2 certain lack of coordination and understanding. but ths was overcome
satisfactorily.
2. The feasibility studies carried out by GEODOL were approved by the World
Para. 11, Bank since they conformed to international standards, and the delays were
Annex 6 and due to factors beyond our control.
footnote 4
3. The failure to hire consultants was due to the fact that the selected
Para. 13, consulting fim backed out after proposals had been invited.
Anx.6 suitable
modifiWi At the start of the project CEBOOL was required only to carry out basic
Para.11    studies. Later, however, It was assigned the responsibility of
Anx. 6 and performing prefeasibility and, subsequently, feasibility studies, and
footnote 3 while at the start it did not bave the necessary experienc, it now has
-ltidisciplinary teams of professionals providing it with the expertise
to formulate an4 appraise mining projects, as demonstrated by ecution
of the Kumurana Project.
5. The Report mentions the 'limited capacity and lack of receptiveness of
Para. 30,  the local entities," a remarks in GEOBOL's case at least, that is totally
Annex 6 andinconsistent vith reality, since the foreign technical assistance
footnote 7, received by GEOBOL was used extensively whenever consultants were
available to transmit their experience.
6.  GEOBOL produced 24 prefeasibility studies. The delay was at the
Para. 11  feasibility stage, originally to have been executed by private
Annex 6 andcosultants. This did not come about because of the high cost assigned
footnote 4 to this stage by the private consultants, a cost that the mining
enterprises were not in a position to finance, and the absence of a line
of preinvestment finacing.
As a positive outcome of the project, it has generated a wide range of
experiences and lessons, which have in turn enabled GEOBOL to train
professionals in the formulation and appraisal of mining projects.
