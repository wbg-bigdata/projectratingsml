CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLLC
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES DEVELQPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Central African Republic
Benefiary                 Ministry of Rural Development (MDR)
Credit AMoU:              SDR 18.8 million (US$ 25.8 million equiv.)
Terms:                    Standard IDA with 40 year maturity
Goflnancin:g               US$12.9 million (UNDP, France, Germany, Switzerland)
Proiect Description:      The main objectives of the project are:
li)   to set up permanent rural support services at a cost to
Govemment that will eventually become sustainable without
outside assistance and,
(ii)   to support the tendency among local people to organize
themselves in groups to manage village affairs.
with the ultimate goal of improving rural producers' productivity,
Incomes and living conditions, through the development of agricultural
and artisanal activities.
To achieve these objectives the project will pursue the institutional
reform initiated under previous SALs and provide technical and financial
support to the reformed institutions. Specifically, the project will
support sector management by strengthening the Rural Development
Ministry (MDR), technology development by consolidating on-going
research efforts under a National Agricultural Research Service (ICRA),
and a range of field activities by establishing a National Agricultural
Development Agency (ACDA). The latter will be bome out of several
existing fragmented rural development structures. Through these
Institutions and a large staff training and technical assistance program,
the project will promote a new participatory approach whereby rural
development programs will rely to a much greater extent than in the
past on the Initiatives, whether individual or collective, of the local
people.
The range of field activities funded by the project Include research,
extension, animal traction and agro-forestry; artisanal activities (e.g.
trade, blacksmithing, carpentry); rural infrastructure; and credit. The
project will not always directly provide all the required inputs and
services. It will set up a framework for assessing villagers' needs and
In some cases will merely act as a vehicle to facilitate their access to
relevant specialized institutions (whether public, private or NGO).

Pro:2o Qgneftts:        Project benefits are of two orders:  first, the building of stronger, better
coordinated agricultural institutions which will operate at lower casts than the
sum total of the fragmented, sometimes overlapping donor-funded Interventions
that prevailed so Tar; second, improvements in the livelihood of rural people,
made possible by project actions designed to increase agricultural productivity
and create artisanal employment. Since women provide the majority of labor
for crop maintenance and processine, the successful extension of labor saving
technologies will be of particular benefit to them by rec;ucing their workload.
Through the community participation approach, villages will become
increasingly more efficient at managing their own affairs. The educated rural
youths are expected to gain responsibility and social status as a result. Other
equally s'gnificant benefits are expected to arise from the emergence of
numerous, varied trading and artisanal activities which will stimulate exchanges
and monetize the economy in the project area; and from improved rural
infrastructure that will contribute to ease the burden on transport of goods and
people.
Prolect Risks:          The major risks with the project relate to the ability of technical staff to
appreciate and implement the new participatory rural development approach.
Considerable on-the-job training is therefore provided for. Another major
source of uncertainty is marketing which is a key factor currently limiting
production. The project places emphasis on actions designed to ease
marketing constraints (roads and tracks, traders credit, and market information)
and to identify nev- -8;3rket opportunities by establishing direct links with
importers of speciall' -nducts.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A.   .Sqctoral Overview
1.01         The Central African Republic (CAR), endowed with abundant land, a small population,
a favorable climate and adequate soils, has a good agriculture potential. It can and does produce a
wide variety of cash crops, foodcrops and livestock products and has rich forestry and wildlife
resources. Agriculture, practiced according to traditional methods, supplemented by hunting and
gathering, -. the fundamental economic activity of the country. Given the country's ample land
resources, this primitive agriculture can provide a basic food supply adequate in calories for the
country's population.
1.02         The abundance and general under exploitation of natural resources in fact conceal wide
disparities between zones. Areas of higher population densities, in the forest area around Bangui, or
in the North-West savanna area, are suffering the effects of environmental degradation. The current
methods of using natural resources, combined with the relative rapid growth of the human and
livestock populations, are creating a process of degradation that, while 31oW, will be difficult to reverse.
While the situation is not yet alarming, it is a matter of serious concern for the medium- and long-term
future.
i 03        Agriculture is overwhelmingly based on small farm units of about 2 ha (about 350,000
-arms in total), usually displaying a wide variety of crops. A farm unit commonly grows in any given
:ear, manioc, groundnuts, maize, sorgho, sesame, cowpeas and garden crops, in addition to holding
a couple of goats and a few chicken. Food is predominantly for subsistence, only 30% being
exchanged or marketed. Monetarisation is very limited, and barter, especially between farmers and
livestock owners is common.
1.04         Livestock raising is generally not integrated to crop farming. Most large animals (chiefly
zebus) are in the hands of migratory herders (about 22,000 families with an average 100-120 head
of cattle each). Livestock production systems are extensive llow density), with a tendency to semi-
sedentarism (short migrations) permitted by the relatively good rainfall and forage potential of the treed
savanna. The CAR's cattle herd has been growing rapidly since the mid-70's, chiefly through
immigration from the Sahel of herders who have been attracted by the substantial availability of grazing
and surface water, and more recently the rising quality of CAR animal health services.
1.05         Farmers spend a substantial part of their time in pursuits other than farming. Hunting,
fishing, gathering, honey and liquor making feature prominently in the daily lives of rural households.
In the CAR rural people spend less than 100 days per year on farming (compared to some 200 to 220
days in the Sahel). Competing claims for non-agricultural pursuits are thus high, though often
underestimated and marked seasonal labor shortages occur. Women contribute an important share of
farm labor, on both food and cashcrops, as well as for food processing.
1.06         Foodcrops, grown by smallholders, and livestock, raised by migratory herders,
contribute each an estimated 33% of total agricultural value added. A further 20% is derived from
hunting, and gathering. Another 5% comes from cashcrops. Cotton and tobacco grown exclusively
by smallholders, and coffee, grown by smallholders and industrial plantations are the main cash crops.
In addition two public sector estates produce sugar and palmoil. Wood products account for the
balance agricultural value added. Agriculture and forestry generate some 40% of the country's export
value.



2 -
1.07         Despite favorable natural conditions and assistance from several external donors,
agriculture In the CAR remains essentially underdeveloped. Farming is predominantly done by shifting
cultivators with only rudimentary hand tools. Animal traction and draft cultivation are unimportant.
Yi_ld are very low, which given the low rural population density, is not very surprising. Of more
concern, is the fact that yields have not markedly improved over the past thirty years. Even more
importantly, labQ productivity is low and is not improving. In the CAR, solutions to the problem of
raising farmers' productivity and incomes have eluded all donors alike.
1.08         The country's landlocked position and high transportation costs further reduce CAR's
competitiveness for export crops. Conversely, they provide natural protection from imports. In
comparison with other African countries, food imports from world markets are low. The share of
ifnports in national consumption of foodstuffs is only about 5% in calorie terms. The most serious
challenge to local production comes from neighboring countries, because of the attraction of the CFAF
(e.g. palm oil from Zaire) or subsidized exports (e.g. sugar from Gabon).
1.09         Internal trade remains underdeveloped. Long distance procurement for a city the size
of Bangui is considered low (less than 30% of local procurement comes from beyond 100 km). This
situation is explained by the small size of the Bangui market, dilapidation of the country's infrastructure
in the 70's, limitations imposed on domestic trade up to the mid-80's, and lack of support for this
sector since then. Despite recent improvements to infrastructure and freer trade flows, town-dwellers
continue to produce part of their subsistence needs or to obtain them directly through a network of
personal relationships.
B.    Institutional Framework
1.10         The institutional set-up for agricultural development is largely the result of
donors'requirenients that their projects be implemented by individual agencies in specific areas. This
has led to the creation of a multiplicity of agencies (SOCADA in the "cotton savanna', PRODEROM
in the 'food crop savanna", ADECAF in the Western coffee areas, Center-South Project in the Eastern
coffee areas and SCAT in the tobacco area, to cite only the main agricultural agencies), each one with
its general direction and cadre of technical personnel. This multiplicity of agencies with unavoidable
duplications and inadequate coordination overall, causes particular problems in a country which has
very scarce managerial, financial and technical resources, and led to relatively poor technical
achievements at high costs. In general, the provision of agricultural support function has taken into
account only a small part of the production system, as it tends to concentrate on one main cash crop,
and lacks the flexibility to meet the farmers' diverse needs. With an eye to immediate efficiency and
autonomy vis-a vis a poorly structured environment, most donors have never really considered the
possibility c,f entrusting certain activities such as input distribution and seed multiplication to private
enterprises, with the result that agencies have been burdened with too many tasks.
Sectoral Planninn and Coordination
1.11         The large number of projects, often covering similar fields but implemented by different
agencies, has seriously hampered or even totally precluded systematic technical and financial
monitoring by the central ministry, Ministry of Rural Development (MDR), that is in principle responsible
for planning, designing and monitoring field activities. This situation has worsened the difficulties of
the ministry which already had to operate on an inadequate budget and received little or no extemal
funding. As a result, sectoral policy formulation and planning has been weak or non-existent, exchange
of information among projects on common topics has been meager and lessons from development
experience have been lost.



-3-
Aoricultural Research
1.12         In the CAR, agronomic research had fallen behind that in other countries as a result of
the "Agrarian Reform' of 1970 when Bokassa, then Head of State expelled all foreign agricultural
technical personnel. It was only revived in the early 1 980's under various donor funded projects. Each
agricultural development agency set up Its own research unit, carrying out prog-'ms in existing
research stations or in project supported networks. There is a lack of coordination overall. The body
theoretically in charge of defining research policies and priorities Is the Superior Research Council
(SRC), including the ministers of the technical departments involved (including besides MDR, the
Forestry Ministry, sad the Ministry of Higher Education). But so far it has not exercised its role in
planning and resource allocation. In reality, the decisions on policies, research strategies to be applied
and resources to be allocated are taken in isolation by the management authorities of each of the
agencies or projects carrying out research. No mechanism exists to coordinate and harmonize these
interventions. This leads inevitably to some overlap of efforts and wastage of scarce human and
financial resources.
1.13         The available human resources for agricultural research are extremely limited. It has
been estimated that for crop research alone, at present about 20 researchers having adequate
academic background and previous research experience would be available in ongoing programs and/or
would be recoverable from administrative positions. Because there is no specific personnel policy for
researchers, promotion is linked with increasing administrative responsibility and the scarce human
research potential is thus further reduced. At present there is no facility for post graduate training in
the country and this has to be undertaken overseas.
1.14         The bulk of all research is along commodity lines with only one or a few disciplines
involved and often rather narrowly concentrated on one or two major crops. The research program
of PRODEROM focuses on variety tests and plant protection for cassava. The SOCADA research
focusses on genetics and plant protection programs of cotton. The research service of ADECAF works
on polyclone multilocational trials. The Center-South project started more recently has two programs,
one on coffee and one on foodcrops (groundnuts, maize, rice and cassava). This commodity-based
research has clear drawbacks as adoption of technologies is constrained by issues related to the
integration of such technologies in the farming system. In recent years, research aimed at improving
farming systems was started in SOCADA, but in a controlled environment. What is yet lacking is a
good understanding of farmers real life constraints. Little effort has been spent on analyzing existing
farming practices (crop associations, rotations, varieties, cultivation practices) and the motivations that
underlie them. Finally although research operations are mostly integrated in development agencies and
projects, there seems to be a lack of systematic linkage with and feed back from extension services
and farmers especially at the stage of the programming of research.
Agricultural Extension
1.15         Provision of agricultural extension has been equally fragmented among several projects,
sometimes overlapping. It has been limited in scope, generally confined to a narrow crop coverage that
contrasts markedly with the diversified production system of CAR farmers. With the exception of the
IFAD-financed PRODEROM, extension services have been directed at cash crops, therefore bypassing
women producers who are predominant in foodcrop production. The extension methodology has been
inefficient. In their extension role, field agents generally took a markedly dirigiste approach, particularly
in the larger projects, often limiting their work to the transmission of standardized messages that were
not well adapted to the real needs of rural producers and to the circumstances under which they
operate. The approach has been mainly technical and focussed on raising the yields of particular crops,
ignoring all too often the physical and socio-economic environment of the farm units (e.g.relative land
abundance, labor constraints, marketing bottlenecks). Generally, government technical staff at all



-4 -
iivels did not dialogue with farmers thereby failing to grasp their motivations and constraints. This
wbs due In part to working habits and in the belief that schooled government personnel know better
than illiterate farmers. It was also due to the conception of extension by Government and donors alike,
which with the benefit of hindsight appears to have been overly simplistic and technocratic, failing to
understand the complev interrelationships in the use of production factors in a constrained
environment.
1.16         Truly professional advisory service would have required a much better trained and
supervised staff. Besides lacking support from the senior echelons of the related agencies, field agents
suffered from inadequate training and, In many cases, a low basic educational level which made them
unsuited to the role of agricultural advisors. As a result of all these factors, extension staff often went
on repeating year after year the same messages to farmers, even though farmers did not generally
apply their recommendations. Even taking ;...-i account time spent on input distribution, organization
of crop marketing, and administrative fo-  A" s, the number of extension agents was not justified.
In the larger agencies (SOCADA, ADECAk ,, n ,mbers have actually been reduced in recent years with
no apparent deterioration of farming practices. It is today widely acknowledged that extension
expenditures which have been substantial overall have not been cost effective. A major overhaul of
extension services is naeded.
Livestock Extension
1.17         In 1973, faced with an almost complete collapse of the Government Livestock Service,
herders formed a private and autonomous Association of Central African Livestock Producers to
facilitate drug distribution. In parallel local herders associations were developed, and the Association
eventually O1986) became a Federation of local producer organizations (FNEC). This institution, unique
in Africa, represents the herders at national level and distributes inputs. It handles much of the
curative animal health needs. It derives its income from membership dues and profits on input sales.
1.18         Government services were revived by an IDA funded project in 1979. These evolved
into today's National Livestock Development Agency (ANDE) which is responsible for preventive
veterinary medicine, extension in rangeland use and animal husbandry, research and analysis on drug
resistance and disease outbreak, pilot activities in pastoral settlement, and sanitary border control.
Some extension responsibility is progressively being transferred to FNEC under the IDA-financed
National Livestock Development project which is on-going since 1985.
Agricultural Marketina
1.19         Food crop marketing is undertaken by the so-called "Wali gala' trade women, who
collect the products in rural areas and sell them directly on the Bangui and other urban markets. Each
transaction involves a small quantity because there is no wholesale and storage capacity at the "wali
g ^" level is practically non-existent. The financial base of these trade women is also extremely
l. ",.ed; in order to earn a sufficient income, they are obliged to have a high turnover which they do
not always achieve. They depend for their transport on private services which are confined to the
main roads. Farmers in the project area are currently not engaged in bulking their products. The
Barngui-based wali-gala have recently started to benefit from credit facilities under the VITA operated
credit component of the Enterprise Rehabilitation Project. They have also formed a wali-gala
association which aims at improving their working conditions.
1 .20        Though marketing and the circulation of domestically produced foodcrops has improved
as a result of market and price liberalization in the early 80's, marketing constraints remain important.
They are due to several factors: (i) the limited size of the urban markets, the existence of some
competition from food imports (though less than in other African countries), and the stagnating
purchasing power of urban dwellers in recent years; (ii) the high labor demand for collection, transport



-5 -
and processing of crops by farmers (lack of access tracks, costs and processing equipment); (iii) the
high marketing costs due to the poor condition of rurai roads, and the small size of rural traders and
the lack of an efficient whz lesale to retail marketing network; liv) insufficient attention being given by
research and extension to product diversification; and (v) inadequate circulation of information on the
nature and volume of available surpluses In various regions of the country.
1.21         Cashcrops by contrast are still the subject of either price regulation and direct marketing
interventions, though these have been reduced iri recent years as well. For these crops, Government
and certain donors had until recently favored ctutput purchase systems run by parastatals. Most
importantly among those are SOCADA for snallholder cotton, SCAT for smallhold 3 tobacco,
government cooperatives for farm purchase of coffee and CAISTAB, the coffee marketing board for
coffee exports. State enterprises had also been created to produce and market import substitution
crops (CENTRAPALM and SOGESCA for palmoil and sugar respectively). All these parastatals are still
in existence though most have been reduced in size and in function. Prices of cash crops are all
regulated with resulting sector deficits in recent years of low commodity prices on world markets.
Although producer prices and intermediate costs have been reduced by administrative decision and
austerity measures, all deficits could not be eliminated. The cotton and coffee sector still require state
assistance.
Rural Credit
1.22         The lack of an aaricultural and rural credit system impedes investment and development
in rural areas. The formal financial sector is not represented at the rural level. There exist two active
commercial banks: the Union Bancaire en Afrique Centrale (UBAC) and the Banque Internationale pour
l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO). A third, the Bank Populaire Maroco-Centrafricaine (BPMC), started
operations in 1991. These banks are mainly in Bangui, with only two agencies outside (Bouar and
Berberati). Financing of the agricultural sector, has been mainly for crop purchase credit by traders
and exporters. The only formal credit available to rural producers has been made by project units and
agencies (e.g SOCADA, ADECAF or ANDE) which sell certain input and equipment on credit which they
are expected to recover. Recovery rates have been very good in the case of cotton inputs by SOCADA
which has a captive market for cotton, but much less satisfactory in the case of the others. This type
of credit is normally in kind for very specific inputs, which only respond to a fraction of the very
diversified needs of rural producers. Commercial banks are not likely to extent their credit operations
into rural areas due to the very high transaction costs of small credit operations, their inherert
riskiness, and the absence of sufficient guarantees by potential borrowers.There exist informal credit
systems similar to the tontines of neighboring Cameroon. Nevertheless they appear to be less
developed than in the latter co'ntry, and to be called upon for consumption and emergency needs
more often than for productive investments.
Rural Infrastructure
1.23         About 60% of the 14,400 km of rural road network is generally in a poor state of
repair. Consequently provision of inputs and consumer goods, and collection and marketing of cotton
and other agricultural produce, is difficult and costly due to high vehicle operating costs. Some 9,000
km of these rural roads have, until recently, been under the responsibility of donor-funded agricultural
agencies such as SOCADA, ADECAF, ANDE, SCAT and a few others, including forestry companies.
The balance was under the responsibility of MDR which had no funds to carry out its rural road
program. Most of the agricultural agencies have periodically suffered from inadequate funds, which
has prevented them from adhering to a regular maintenance program. This has been the case of
SOCADA, where rural development activities have not been funded by donors since 1990. The cotton
area savanna includes a total of about 3,600 km of rural roads, of which 1,900 km are in need of
rehabilitation. Of these 3,600 km, an estimated 700 km are primary rural roads, which constit ite
essential links between the rural development zones and the regional and national road networks; the



-6-
rest being secondary and tertiary rural roads used for crop collection throughout the agricultural zones.
1.24         Since 1988, MDR has no responsibility for executing rural road programs.
Rehabilitation and maintenance of primary rural roads (1,700 km nationwide) are now the responsibility
of the Ministry of Public Works (MTP), while works on secondary and tertiary rural roads are the
responsibility of the rural development field services which are being restructured under the proposed
project. A Department of Rural Roads has been created at MTP under the Transport Sector Project
(Credit-21 26-CA). This Credit funds the preparation of a masterplan for rural roads, which will permit
investment and maintenanne expenditures of primary rural roads to be carried out on the basis of
economic and engineering criteria and regional agricultural productivity.
C.    Natural Resource Manaaement
1.25         Preservation of natural resources is a matter of relatively recent concern in the CAR,
where admittedly environmental problems are less apparent than elsewhere due to abundant natural
riches. Past policies and actions in the natural resource sector emphasized the allocation of forestry
and hunting permits and the collection of taxes from timber and safari companies. Meanwhile, with
the spread of agriculture and livestock rearing, associated bush and forest fires, and fuelwood
gathering, the tropical rainforcst of the South-Western part of the country receded rapidly around main
towns and along access roads and tracks. In the savanna, the rich native fauna, including rhinos,
elephants and giraffes, have been destroyed :n great numbers to the point where certain species are
threatened of extinction. The main causes of destruction are shift-and-burn cultivation by poor
farmers, large scale poaching by armed bands from neighboring countries, and smaller scale poaching
by nationals, sometimes with the tacit agreement of local authorities. Solutions to this type of
problems are not simple. Yet measures have to be taken to slow down the resulting rapid process of
environmental degradation if the country is to preserve one of its main long term asset. These include
tree and wildlife protection measures as well as measures to increase income from existing farmed
areas, thereby limiting the attraction of alternative earnings which hunting, gathering and migration into
new lands represent for poor farmers.
D.    The North-West and Center East Agricultural Regions
1.26         Field activities to be supported by the proposed project fall within two broad agricultural
regions, the North-West and Center East regions, which coincide with the "Cotton Area Savanna',
named after the area's main cash crop. These two regions cover six prefectures: Ouham-Pende,
Ouham, Gribingui Economique, Kemo-Gribingui, Ouaka and Basse Koto (Map 19219). Topographically,
these regions are part of an extensive rolling plateau, divided by a central northeast, southwest ridge.
Average altitude is 610 meters. Climate is intertropical with temperatures ranging between 180 and
350. The rainy season is well defined (April to October). Annual rainfall ranges from 1,300 mm to
the North to 1,700 mm in the South. Natural Vegetation is chara^terized by Soudano Guinean wooded
savannah. Soils are generally lateritic. The potentially arable land area is substantial, covering
approximately 40% of the area, including 50% of soils of mediocre quality, 45% of soils of average
to good quality and only 5% of very good soils.
1.27         Outside of cotton, there is diversity of small monetary income opportunities, including
other cash crops (tobacco & coffee In certain zones), foodcrops, mainly cassava, and also millet, com,
sesame, groundnut, squash, and paddy, small stock Including goats and pigs, beekeeping for honey,
wax and liquor, and off-farm activities including fishing, hunting, timber, woodwork, gold and diamond
mining in certain areas, and production of various indigenous beers. Specific local opportunities and
family labor constraints imply that farm households are not able to equally exploit all opportuntities and
a relative specialization at sub-regional, local and farm level exists. While all farm household tend to
have an extremely diverse production base, relative emphasis is placed on two or three main activities.
Ease of marketing determines to a large extent the importance of activities such as the sale of cassava,



-7 -
game and honey. Sales of other products locally are made possible by the relative specialization and
resulting opportunities for exchange at the local level. The diversity of income opportunities explains
for a large part the low attention given by farmers to cotton despite considerable public sector support
for this crop. Priority is normally given to foodcrops, and seasonally to off-farm opportunities.
Innovations that ease labor constraints, and technical assistance to farming households that deal with
all aspects of their production systems, including the eventual introduction of new products, are
therefore necessary components of future development programs for these areas.
11. g0QERNMENT AND BANK STRATEGY IN THE SECTOR
A.    Recent Trend in Government Sectoral Policies
2.01         During recent years, the Governrent of the CAR has taken a number of important
measures to rehabilitate the economy and reduce the often excessive charges borne by the state, while
at the same time promoting development of the private sector in the context of a market economy.
The agricultural sector has been a major target of Government adjustment efforts, with three broad
directions of changes. First, fundamental reforms of the incentive system for the production and
marketing of agricultural products have been implemented, with a view to short-term productivity gains
that will improve the sector's competitiveness. Second, new approaches have been identified to bring
more relevance to long term agricultural productivity improvem6nt programs, and institutional reforms
have been designed to bring about the resulting fundamental shift in approach. Third, the goal of
preserving the country's natural resources for future generation has been added to the Government's
policy agenda and actiun on this front has started. The following discussion concentrates on the
second point, i.e. produ-,tivity improvement and institutional restructuring which are the object of IDA
support under the proposed project.
2.02         Starting in 1988, the MDR carried out an important program of sector studies in an
attempt to reorient the country's agricultural strategy. As a follow up to this work, in mid- 1989,
Govemment invited the Donor Community to a UNDP-sponsored agriculture sector roundtable in
Bangui, at which the issue of organizing and funding agricultural support services was debated at
length. At this meeting, a consensus emerged on the need to strengthen research and extension, on
the basis of a production system approach, as it is more likely to produce innovations adapted to the
CAR farmer context than those generated by a narrower approach geared at the promotion of specific
crops. It was stressed than such an approach would require a much stronger research capacity, a high
degree of decentralization of agricultural services, with a network of multi-skilled extension agents
working in close collaboration with research and capable of progressively becoming true agricultural
advisers. At the same time, the meeting identified the need to organize producers for crop marketing
and input distribution, to develop small enterprises for agro-processing and rural services, and to
promote rural savings and credit associations. Finally, it was acknowledged that rural infrastructure
development is an important element of the rural development strategy, to facilitate trade to and from
rural areas and improve living conditions in these areas. To do all of the above while keeping
Govemment support services light and low cost, meeting participants emphasized the need to rely on
producer groups as channels for the delivery of input and services to farmers. The proposed strategy
Is thus fundamentally new In many respects, and its implementation will require new service
organizations and new skills and attitudes from. the staff.
2.03         To implement the new strategy, in 1989 Govemment embarked on a process of
institutional reforms. First, in that year, MDR completed a major reorganization with the lay-off of
about a third of its personnel, and a clearer definition of the mandates of each service. Its role was
limited to central planning and coordination, while implementatior of all development actions and the
supply of all farm support services were to be the sole responsioility of autonomous agencies under



-8-
the umbrella of the Ministry. At the same time, a decision was taken to consolidate all research
activities under the umbrella of a National Agricultural Research Institute, yet to be established. In
parallel a decision was also taken to restructure the organizations in charge of implementing rural
development programs and projects, in order to eliminate duplication of activities, create more flexible,
less cumbersome services, and harmonize extension methods around a system based approach; the
aim being to replace the existing framework made up of project funded agencies of various size and
functions and to create in each main region a  .ngle multi-disciplinary rural development service backed
up by common technical support services at central level. The reform will be initiated in the savanna
area, both in the zone currently covered by PRODEROM and that covered by SOCADA, the cotton
eaancy. Eventually, the new approach will be extended to the coffee-producing areas currently served
by ADECAF and the Center-South project.
B.    IDA's Involvement in CAR Aaricultural Sector
2.04         Since the mid-1980's, in the face of unfavorable macro-economic and sectoral
circumstances and limited opportunity for profitable investment, Bank involvement in CAR agriculture
has been concentrated on policy-based operations. Only two sectoral investment operations have been
processed in the past five years, one in livestock (National Livestock Development Project FY87) and
one in forestry (Natural Resource Management FY90). Over the same period, the Bank has been
closely associated with Govemment's efforts made to restructure the country's economy and its
agricultural sector. Three SALs (SAL 3 is on-going) and one sector adjustment credit (Cotton Sector
Adjustment Program FY88) have been approved, all designed to support the opening up of the CAR's
economy to the interplay of market forces, and the retrenchment of the over-extended public sector.
Each policy-based operation has included a substantial and increasingly deeper program of incentive
and institutional reforms for agriculture, covering the country's main sub-sectors and agencies (coffee,
cotton and foodcrops incentive policies and MDR, SOCADA and CAISTAB restructuring). From studies
through action plans to concrete measures, these sector program components pursued a progressive
liberalization of food and cashcrop markets and supported the formulation of the above described
reform of the sector's institutional policies. The p:oposed Agricultural Services Development Prc' c t
has as its main objective to translate the agreed institutional policies into actions both at the center
and in the field.
C.    Lessons of Past Lendina
2.05         Previous projects were somewhat top-down in character, and were geared to
disseminating standardized technical messages in pursuit of broad economic goals e.g. raising the
output of a major export crop or improving food self-sufficiency, while the approach tended to loose
sight of the physical and socio-economic context of farms. Technical staff were not expected to gain
an understanding of farmers circumstances, and had no tradition of working in close collaboration with
them. As a result, projects did not necessarily respond to actual farmers needs or fit their particular
circumstances. Their design too often underestimated the breadth of constraints which farmer. face,
both on-farm and off-farm, which go well beyond agronomic problems on one crop (e.g. conflicting
labor demand between export and subsistence crops, transport bottlenecks, processing constraints,
limited access to inputs and markets etc.) and the fact that the relative impact of constraints vary from
village to village.
2.06         Past development interventions have brought to light the need to adopt more flexible
rural development approaches, responsive to farmers particular circumstances and specific local
conditions. This calls for a redirection of project design and methods, in the form of multifaceted
interventions at village level, rather than integrated rural development project at regional level (Project
Area RDP) or single component projects of a national scope (National Extension Projects). The
Government recently formulated agricultural strategy and forthcoming donor supported development
interventions reflect this new understanding of the country's rural development needs.

Ill. THE PROJECT
A.    Proiect Obiectives and General Descrintion
Proiect Obiectives
3.01         The main objective of the project is to build up new agricultural service institutions
capable of implementing the above shift in sectoral strategy and rural development approach, with the
ultimate goal of improving rural producers' productivity and incomes. A secondary objective is to
reduce the sum total of public sector interventions, with the aim of bringing Government expenditures
down to a level that will eventually become sustainable without outside assistance.
3.02         To attain these two objectives, rural development programs will rely to a much greater
extent than in the past on the initiatives, whether individual or collective, of the local people. These
are expected to better respond to actual constraints and needs, support a greater number of people
at lower cost, and above all promote autonomous and self-sustainable development by rural
communities and individuals.
General Proiect Delscrition
3.03         The project is designed to complete the institutional reform initiated under previous
adjustment operations and to provide technical and financial support to the reformed institutions and
field activities. A PPF (P-539-CA) is in place to finance project preparatory activities and institutional
restructuring.
3.04         Institutional Reform.  Once the on-going process of reform is completed, the
institutional framework will consist of three autonomous agencies under the umbrella of the Rural
bevelopment Ministry (MDR) whose role will remain limited to activities of conception and coordination
of sectoral policies and investments. As illustrated in Annex 1, the three agencies under MDR will be:
(i)    a National Research Institute (ICRA) responsible for research planning and
implementation under which all existing research activities will be consolidated;
(ii)    a National Agricultural Development Agency (ACDA), with a small and highly mobile
central staff responsible for providing technical and logistical support to largely
autonomous field services. These field services will take the form of Regional
Directorates, one for eeah main ecological area; and,
(iii)   a National Livestock Development Agency (ANDE), already in existence, responsible
for providing technical back-up in animal health and husbandry techniques, to regional
agricultural services in addition to its other responsibilities in the provision of services
to transhumant livestock owners.
3.05         In a first phase, corresponding to the proposed project period three DRDAs will be
created: one in the foodcrop savanna (Center-West DRDA), with headquarters in Yaloke that will take
over the staff and infrastructure of the completed PRODEROM project, and two in the cotton area
savanna, with headquarters in PAOUA (North-West DRDA) and Bambarl (Center-East DRDA), that will
take over the rural development staff and equipment of the existing SOCADA and ACADOP. The
remainder of SOCADA, namely the industrial and commercial part of the company, has become a
cotton ginning and marketing enterprise (SOCOCA) run along commercial lines. A recently approved
CCCE grant is funding its rehabilitation.



- 10-
3.06         The proposed project will support the establishment of ICRA and ACDA (ANDE has
been established under the on-going National Livestock Development project). It will also support the
establishment of the two cotton area DRDAs (North-West and Center-East), while IFAD is funding the
foodcrop savanna DRDA (Center West). To ensure that the process of institutional reforms will be
pursued, assurances were obtained at nenotiations that the South-West and Center-South DRDAs will
be established n3o later than June 30. 1995. ACDA and its DRDAs will be responsible for promoting
the new participatory approach to the design and implementation of rural development programs.
Estipblishment of ICRA and ACDA in accordance with statutes acceotable to IDA. their readiness to
start operations. and selection of all nersonnel are conditions of credit effectiveness. Preparation of
the legal statutes for the new entities as well as preliminary restructuring steps are financed under the
PPF. Should ICRA and ACDA be dismantled or their statutes be modified adversely, credit
disbursements would be susoended.
3.07         Technical and Financial Sugoort. The project will provide technical and financial support
to the following:
{i)    Rural Development Ministry, to strengthen its capacity in sector management and
planning;
lii)    National Research Institute, including rehabilitation of existing facilities, formal and on-
the job training of research personnel, and funding of four research programs
corresponding to four of the five basic farming systems identified in the CAR (i.e.
excluding pastoral livestock systems which are funded under the on-going National
Livestock Development Project);
(iii)   National Agricultural Development Agency, including technical assistance for on-the job
staff training, vehicles, facilities and operating funds. Over the project period, this
support will go as a matter of priority to:
(a)    ACDA Headquarters located in Bangui, comprising central financial and
procurement services, a marketing support unit, and a cadre of highly
mobile senior technicians and foreign experts;
(b)   the North-West and Center-East Regional Directorates, comprising
support services and specialists housed at regional HO and a network
of field development agents throughout the region responsible for
agricultural extension and community development work;
(c)    a large training program organized by ACDA for its staff and rural
youths.
(iv)   Credit Unit, including technical assistance provided by an NGO, equipment and
operating funds, plus a line of credit for financial assistance to farmers, traders and
communities;
(v)    A rural infrastructure program, consisting mainly of rural roads, and tracks;
(vi)   Project Coordination and Administration, including provision of a Project Financial
Coordinator located at the MDR.
3.08         With the support of the training program, the staff of the new service institutions will
be taught to work closely with the village communities, for the planning and implementation of public
sector interventions at the local level. To be responsive to villagers' needs, the project will support
a wide range of activities, including the key areas of technology development and transfer (research,



- 11 -
extension, on-farm investment, animal traction, agro-forestry); transport, processing, and marketing;
the development of commercial and artisanal activities in demand in rural areas (traders, blacksmiths,
carpenters); tracks and other rural infrastructure(e.g village stores, water points); and land registration.
The project will not always directly provide all the required inputs and services. It will set up a
framework for assessing villagers' needs and in some cases will merely act as vehicle to facilitate their
access to relevant specialized institutions (whether public, private or NGO).
B.    Detailed Proiect Features and Organization
Sector Manaaement and Planning (Strenathenina of the MDR)
3.09          The main objective of this component is to strengthen the Rural Development Ministry'
capacity to carry out its mandate. Following the restructuring it underwent in 1989, its organizational
structure (Annex 2) is now adequate to play the planning and supervisory role which it was assigned.
Policy is formulated at cabinet level with input from two Departments. The Department of Planning,
Studies and Monitoring (DGPES) is in charge of preparing the sector's public investment program,
commissioning studies in support of policy and project formulation, and monitoring policy and
investment program implementation. The Department of Administrative and Agricultural Support
(DGAAA) has a double charge: first, it takes care of personnel and financial aspects of the Ministry;
second, it is in charge of coordination among various agencies and projects under the MDR, and has
a network of Regional Delegates (one in each prefecture) whose role it is to liaise with the local
administration of their region and with regional sector organizations and projects.
3.10         The project will provide key departments and services of the Ministry with their
minimum requirements in terms of facilities, office equipment, vehicles, operating funds, technical
assistance and training. The DGPES is already benefitting from a UNDP technical assistance in the area
of sector planning and from long-term TA from several donors. Project funded TA is therefore limited
to short-term consultancies to assist MDR managers in defining work programs and methodologies,
and to carry out studies in support of policy and projects formulation. One short-term consultancy (8
man-months) is provided to develop a computerized system to program and monitor public sector
expenditures in rural development and to train local personnel in its utilization. In addition, provision
is made for carrying out a number of specific studies in support of policy formulation. Producer
organization (6 man-months), and land tenure (4 man-months) are priority areas. Finally, funds are
provided for short-term training (50 man-months of MDR staff). Training, mainly in agricultural
economics, will take place in African universities or institutes. Terms of reference of the technical
assistance and the accounting MIS consultancies will be agreed with IDA before Board presentation
and the TOR for the auditor agreed before credit effectiveness.
3.11          Under the project a small adjustment will be made to the organizational chart of the
DGAAA. The number of Regional Delegates will be reduced from 16 at present to 8, i.e. a ratio of 1
for 2 prefectures. With the more coordinated approach that will be adopted for implementing rural
development activities, the need for their services as liaison and coordination agents will decrease.
Less of them will be required and their function will be redefined to include two new activities. First,
they will be in charge of implementing a simple land registration program and resolving disputes over
land issues between farmers and herders. The above land tenure study will provide the framework for
their work in this area. They are well suited to this latter role in view of their independence from both
the National Agricultural Development Agency and the National Livestock Development Agency.
Second they will be in charge of organizing an annual fair in their region. In all countries, fairs have
proven themselves useful as a meeting point for farmers and rural traders and an opportunity to learn
from one another. Funds will be made available for them to carry out this additional function. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the number of Renional Delenates will be reduced from
16 to 8 before credit effectiveness.



- 12 -
Aaricultural Research (Establishment of ICRA)
3.12         The objectives of this component are to develop an institutional framework for
agricultural research policy design, priority setting and resource allocation, and a national institution
for implementing research in a coordinated manner (ICRA); and to implement priority research programs
according to a farming system approach while strengthening linkages between research, extension and
farmers to ensure feedback into project design.
3.13         An interministerial body, the National Council for Agricultural Research (CNRA) will be
established to set research priorities, define policies and determine resource allocation in line with
Government policy. Chaired by the minister MDR, the CNRA will have as members the Forestry
Minister and the High Commissioner for Research. To ensure that agricultural research policies reflect
priorities at fiold level, the Council will include the General (and Regional Directors as needed) of ACDA,
ANDE and ICRA in an advisory capacity. It will not be involved in research programming, or defining
specific research programs. This will be the responsibility of the ICRA. ICRA will have the legal status
of an agency with management and financial autonomy. Its organizational chart is in Annex 3.
3.14         The unit of organization of research will shift from the present commodity basis (cotton
program, maize program etc.) towards a system basis. Accordingly, the research programs will
correspond to the five typical production systems of the country, i.e. in the savanna, cotton/root crops
system (guinean zone), cereal/root crops system (intermediate zone), and cotton, cereals and
leguminous crops systems (sudano-guinean zone); in the forest area, system based on coffee, bananas
and cereals; and, in the sahelo-sudanian zone, pastoral systems with a variable degree of integration
of cereal and vegetable production. Under the project, provision will be made to undertake all
programs, except the pastoral systems program (para. 3.07 lii)).
3.15         The research programs will be carried out by three departments of ICRA: the Savanna
Systems Department; the Forest Systems Department; and the Pastoral Systems Department. The
departments will be located in the regions and each department will use a main research station from
where it will operate a research centre. For the Savanna Systems Department, this will be Bambari,
for the Forest Systems Department, this will be Boukoko, and for the Pastoral Systems Department,
this will be Bouar. Linked to the Department centres will be stations which will reflect different
ecological conditions and where parts of the programs will be carried out. Centres and stations could
be used by all the programs. Where needed for further ecological differentiation, stations will use sub-
stations. The network required to carry out the priority programs is presented in Annex 4.
3.16         Definition of research activities will be based on the analysis of the major constraints
facing farmers in increasing their productivity, as identified by a multidisciplinary team (see para. 3.23-
3.24), thereby closely linking the research programs to farmers' expressed needs. In this analysis,
farmers and extension staff will be fully involved and the resulting definition of constraints and
research programming will be undertaken jointly. The approach comes to identifying technology
constraints within the economic, institutional and social framework within which the farming system
operates and this framework is explicitly taken into account when developing new or improved
technologies. Once the constraints have been identified, the dominant farming system will be
simulated under controlled conditions on research stations and thematic research will be implemented
within this simulation. More localized ecological and production systems variations will be taken into
account through on-farm trials, which will be supervised by the research stations. Only when positive
rest-ts are obtained in these trials, extension on a larger scale will be undertaken.
3.17         The project will support the human and physical investment and operating costs to set
up ICRA and to run the four research programs. It is expected that ICRA headquarters will be housed
in be'ildings previously occupied by ORSTOM  which will undergo light rehabilitation.  Some
rehabilitation of existing facilities will also be required at the main research centers of Bambari and



-13-
Boukoko, and the savanna atations of Soumbe and Poumbaidi. A land use plan for the stations farm
area will be financed, and now sub-stat;ons will be established. All locations will be supplied with
vehicle and equipment to supplement existing ones and receive an adequate operating budget. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained that key positions at ICRA. including those of General Director.
and Deoartment Directors be staffed at all times by staff whose exoerience and oualifications are
accentable to IDA.
3.18         In order to meet the requirements for research personnel, a substantial program of
technical assistance and training will be funded. Some formal training 14 man-years of post-graduate
training and 40 man-months of short-term training) will take place abroad with thesis work conducted
in the CAR. The bulk of training, however, will be on-the-job with the support of resident expatriate
researchers. Short-term training funds will be used to enable national scientists to see the excellent
in-village research that is on-going in other countries (e.g. IDESSA in COte d'lvoire. A total of 6
researchers will need to be provided by technical assistance for periods ranging from one and a half
to two years. Because of the importance of initiating a system approach, in PY1 two system
agronomists will be recruited. Two agronomists will be required in years 3 and 4. Biometrics and
documentalist assistance will be needed for 20 and 18 man-months respectively, both to set up the
systems and train those who would operate the systems after the departure of the TA. Technical
assistance will also be provided to the director-general of ICRA during a period of three years to assist
In setting up and organizing the institution.
3.19         Seed production will be carried out in units attached to the research center of Bambari
and the station of Poumbaidi. These units will be managed separately. They will be responsible for
the production of pre-base and base seeds. Multiplication will be done by selected farmers starting
in year 2 for all crops except cereals. Multiplication of cereal seeds by farmers will only start in year
4 as it is more difficult and requires training. Units will sell seeds at production cost {average
production cost at full capacity). Seed prices at all stages of multiplication will be set by ICRA on the
basis of a cost formula established jointly by ICRA and ACDA. These will be published annually by
MDR. It is expected that seed units will become self financing in PY 4. Therefore, an operating
subsidy is provided in declining amounts in PY 1 to 3. No funds are provided for equipment since a
prior FAO/UNDP project has already made available the required seed certification equipment which
has remained inoperational to this date.
Rural Develonment Field Services JACDA and its DRDAs)
1. Scope of Activities
3.20         ACDA and its Regional Directorates (one for approximately two prefectures) will carry
out all activities related to promotion of village groups, agricultural extension, and training of groups
in non agricultural activities. Their aim will be to: li) identify informal groups (and, where needed., help
organize villagers in new groups) and assist them in the planning and management of village affairs;
Iii) extend to farmers improved production and processing techniques, previously identified and adapted
with the assistance of the research service, and; (iii) support producers and farmers groups in the
identification of market opportunities and the marketing of their products. They wil' also be responsibis
for providing support to villagers in developing artisanal activities le.g. blacksmiths, bricklayers and
carpenters), in carrying out small rural works (e.g. tracks, village stores, market places), and in
organizing the maintenance of rural roads. They will finally ensure the supply at regional level of
certain inputs and equipment (tools, ploughs, carts, mills etc.) for distribution by local traders and
village groups.



- 14 -
2. Taraet Group
3.21         The iarUt group comprises all the area rural population except for the herdsmen who
are &lready catered for by the National Livestock Development Agency. A special effort will be made
to reach two disadvantaged groups: the youths and the women, who both are discriminated against
by local traditions. In the past, youths left the village for that reason. But with the country's
economic crisis, many youths, most of them literate, have returned. They constitute an invaluable
resource for village community development, although they are rarely consulted by the village elders
tor important decisions. The project will make a special effort to reach those youths who are more
likely to be innovative, to take responsibility in running groups and to start up small rural enterprises.
Women will be the natural target group of many project actions, since they play a major role in food
production, processing and small stock raising. In fact, to achieve project goals, fieid development
agents will need to secure the active participation of women. This will be achieved by recruiting
women staff in the field service.
3. Aoiroach
3.22         In order to closely fit project interventions to the local context and to elicit the direct
involvement ot the beneficiaries, the work program of the field service will be the direct product of a
collaborative effort between technical staff and the local people, instead of the more usual
identification of development constraints and their solution through socio-economic and feasibility
studies carried out by outsiders.
3.23         At regional (DRDA) level, the Senior Technical Specialists (extension, community work,
animal traction, marketing, input, agro-forestry and rural infrastructure) will constitute a multi-
disciplinary team (MDT) which will intervene in particular zones (rural development units or UDRs).
Each DRDA area of intervention will be divided into Rural Development Units (UDRs) based on their
agro-ecologic and socio-economic similarities. A dialogue will be established with the villagers of the
UDR by the MDT who will be accompanied in their village visits by the field development agents
(community development and extension workers) of the respective UDR. The MDT will call upon
expertise outside the regional directorate (e.g. ICRA, ANDE) as required by each specific UDR situation.
3.24         The aim of the dialogue will first be to identify the constraints that rural people face
and the solutions which they themselves have developed in response to these constraints (in particular
within the production system). In a second stage, farmers will be encouraged to express their needs
and their ideas on ways to improve their conditions with outside help. These needs are likely to be
varied: improved crop technologies, inputs, animal traction, roads and tracks, periodic markets etc...
Following this phase, relative priorities will be clearly established and a development program for the
respective UDRs will be formulated by the MDT. This program will take into account existing
production systems, needs expressed by the villagers, local capacities to undertake development
activities and market opportunities. It will define the specific actions required in each UDR (whether
in marketing, roads and tracks, repair and other services, credit, water supply, applied research,
agricultural techniques, artisanal activities or training). It will be discussed and amended as required
after discussion with the villagers and the field staff. This planning phase is expected to last about
six months for the first UDRs covered, declining to three months thereafter once experience with the
method has been gained.
3.25         Field development agents will continue to be involved throughout the planning process
thereby gaining an understanding of the new project working methods. This on-the-job training,
following an intensive start-up training course and complemented by bi-monthly seminars and periodic
training sessions on specific themes by subjec-: matter specialists Ipara 3.38), is seen as the most
effective way of upgrading staff skills and achieving the change of attitude and working methods



-15 -
which the project entails. The regional MDT will have in turn been trained by the mobile team of
technical specialists from ACDA HQ, which itself will be strengthened by the participation of foreign
experts familiar with the new approach and/or experienced in needed subject matters (producer
organization, extension, animal traction, marketing etc.).
4. ACDA Headauarters: Mandate and Organization
3.26         The National Agricultural Development Agency will be responsible for implementing the
agricultural and rural development strategy and programs defined by the MDR in accordance with the
policies set by Government and the Ministry. Its national headquarter in Bangui, in buildings heretofore
belonging to SOCADA, will house the General Director's office, and the Administration and Finance
Service. In addition, it will have three units: Monitor ng and Evaluation, Marketing and Training. It
will also house senior technical specialists in the key domaines of activities supported by the project:
input supply, animal traction, and community development, extension and agro-forestry. These high
level technical specialists will init.ally be provided mainly by technical assistance, and be supplemented
then replaced by trained senior nationals before or by the end of the project. They will spend most of
their time in the field. Their role will be to harmonize and coordinate the implementation of field
activities among the Regional Directorates and to provide DRDAs with technical support in all domaines
of activity. ACDA's organizational chart is in Annex 5.
3.27         Since ACDA will be newly established under the project, technical assistance in
management and organization will be provided to the General Direction (an ACDA Management Adviser
for 5 years). A major concern will be to keep ACDA headquarters light in relation to its Regional
Directorates in order to ensure effective delegation of authority to the field. To this end, assurances
were obtained at neaotiations that ACDA HO recurrent expenditures will not exceed 30% of those of
DRDAs North West and Center East combined. This ratio as well as staff number ratios will be
monitored yearly by the Project Financial Coordinator at the time of budget approval.
3.28         The Administrative and Financial Service will be headed by a national who will be
recruited from the private sector. He will be supported by one junior accountant. The chief, of director
rank, will be in charge of consolidating budgets and accounts, and providing financial management
support to the DRDAs. The Monitorina and Evaluation Unit is essential for a Field Service with a large
number of activities. The unit will need to ensure a regular gathering of information, allow a permanent
monitoring of implementation, and undertake mid-term evaluation of the results achieved compared
to the objectives set. The unit will have a chief, an analyst and a team of 8 surveyors who will be
placed in the field (2 in each prefecture). The unit will be supported by an M&E expert for 8 man-
months who will assist the national staff in: organizing a baseline socio-economic survey; designing
and testing an M&E system; establishing a multi-year M&E work program; and, assigning data
gathering responsibilities to the different services.
3.29         At project start, the Training Unit will be in charge of staff selection (para. 3.42),
conducting workshops on the new participatory approach, and translating available techniques into
training themes for diffusion by the extension service. On a more routine basis it will prepare periodic
training programs for extension workers as well as specialized training programs for support service
staff. In addition, it will oversee the implementation of specific training programs for educated youths
(both boys and girls). This service will comprise one chief in charge of staff training and one assistant
in charge of farmers training. Local personnel will be supported by a foreign adviser in the areas of
program formulation, course organization and implementation (3 man-years), and audio-visual
techniques (10 man-months).
3.30         The Marketing Unit will be in charge of market information and development. Its role
will be to improve the flow of information between producers and traders, identify outlets for
traditional or new products, and disseminate improved techniques for processing and storage. To this



- 16-
end, it will receive information on agricultural product volumes and prices from the DRDAs, and will
maintain permanent contact with traders in Bangui, developing contacts between producer groups (via
the DRDAs) with traders, agro-industries and exporters. It will carry out surveys to identify outlets for
traditional crops and opportunities for new products, including on the miational, regional and overseas
export markets. Finally, it will identify and test processing techniques and equipment, organiza their
fabrication or procurement, and eventually conduct promotional campaigns.
3.31         A study of the potential for diversification of CAR agricultural exports has already been
carried out and identified prospects for a variety of specialized, high value and/or, low volume products
whose production could be further developed. In the current situation of unfavorable world markets
for major agricultural commodities, and of low competitiveness of CAR exports, or ly high value,
specialty products for narrow segments of the market would be profitable. Examples of such products
include tropical fruit (Carombola, Passiflora, Pitanga, Guava, Passion fruit etc...), natural coloring
agents (Roucou), honey including by-products (wax, propolis), nuts, spices, essential oils and medicinal
plants. The project will finance follow up actions to this study by the marketing team with the support
of an international marketing firm in order to: set-up two way information flows (to overseas importers
about CAR products and to national exporters about international market possibilities); assist exporters
establish links with would-be importers of CAR products and develop the market image of CAR
products; and help exporters and traders set up pilot export operations for a number of selected
products for which a market has been secured. A total of 12 man-months of ccnsultancies are
provided for this purpose.
3.32         The Animal Traction Sgecialist will play a central role in view of the large unsatisfied
demand for animal traction by cotton area farmers. He will select and standardize ploughs and carts,
arrange with a local industry for the construction of carts, internationally procure ploughs and other
farming equipment, arrange its distribution to the regions, negotiate with the credit agency suitable
terms for animal traction loans to farmers, enter into an agreement with ANDE to secure animal health
services to farmers, provide technical support to the extension service, and develop training programs
for blacksmiths and wood craftsmen for the maintenance of equipment. Given the importance of
animal traction for the success of the project, the project will provide an internationally recruited
consultant experienced in the introduction of animal traction in other African countries (5 man-years).
3.33         The Inout SuoolV Sgecialist will be responsible for identifying production input and
equipment demand from farmers. He will then consolidate orders when these are not available through
normal distribution channels, for central procurement by ACDA HO, and organize the supply to the
regions using private transporters and traders. No funding is provided for these items whose purchase
can be financed under the credit component (para. 3.56). Advances by the project will be made out
of the S3ecial Account.
3.34         The Community Develooment. Extension and Agro-Forestrv Specialists will be key to
the success of the new rural development approach. These specialists will provide the technical input
into the initial and subsequent training programs; they will join the first multi-disciplinary team to work
with UDRs in the regions, thereby training on-the-job the regional MDTs; they will import techniques
and meth'ods from other countries and adapt them to CAR conditions; they will provide constant
support to field activities in their subject matters; and, they will draw lessons gained in one DRDA and
assure their transmission to other DRDAs. These internationally recruited specialists will be highly
skilled in their respective field. In project years 1 to 3, their counterparts will be at DRDA level. From
project year 4 on-ward, they will have a counterpart at ACDA level whom they will train on the job,
and prepare to take over their position by the end of the project. In all, 5 man-years each of technical
assistance are provided in community development and extension and 2 man-years in agro-forestry.
At negotiations, assurances were obtained that key posts at ACDA. includina those of the General
Director. the Financial Director. the two Regional Directors and all technical assistance aersonnel will
be staffed at all times with aersons whose experience and aualifications are acceotable to IDA.



-17-
5. DRDAs: Mandate and Oroanization
3.35         The Regional Directorates will provide assistance to villagers through their network of
field agents (sector chiefs and community development and agricultural extension agents) who will be
supported by several staff services (training, animal traction, rural infrastructure, processing and
marketing, input and equipment, and agro-forestry). These DRDA services will be cornplemented by
services provided by other units and agencies Ifrom ACDA HQ team for training and support in all
technical areas, from ICRA for research, from ANDE for livestock, from MDR delegates for land titling,
from the credit NGO for lending, and from various local NGOs and church projects for miscellaneous
productive and social services). DRDA's organizational chart is in Annex 6.
3.36         The North-West DRDA and the Center-East DRDA will take over the rural development
activities of SOCADA and ACADOP. This reform will require to settle arrears in personnel costs and
will cause the release of about 200 agents (lower field level agents). A national working group has
been established at MDR to prepare the restructuring process, including participating in staff selection.
Its work is funded under the PPF Credit (P-539-CA). UNDP will fund the services of a personnel matter
specialist to verify staff costs resulting from the restructuring (estimated at US$400,000). Staff costs
resulting from the restructuring will be funded by MCD and Switzerland.
3.37         In each DRDA, a Regional Director will be appointed. He will be supported by an
accounting service. Each year, the Regional Director will supply ACDA headquarters with its work
program and budget. Following discussion and approval, each DRDA will be responsible for program
Implementation and will be held accountable for physical and financial results. The regional accounting
offices will receive technical back up from ACDA's financial director and staff for budget preparation
and monitoring. For program implementation, each DRDA will benefit from technical support from the
pool of national specialists.
3.38         Each DRDA will have two field services, one for agricultural extension and one for
community development. The extension service will be represented at regional level (Head of the
Regional Extension Service), sector level (6 Sector Chiefs and 2 to 3 subject-matter specialists in
foodcrops, cashcrops and/or animal traction) and field level (6 to 8 extension agents per sector). The
Community Develooment Service will be represented at regional level (Head of the Regional Community
Development Service), sub-regional level (2 sub-regional CD chiefs) and field level (4 CD agents per
sector). Each service wili receive the back-up of the respective ACDA HQ adviser. In addition, CD
technical assistance will be provided under German funding in the North-West DRDA, and under MCD
funding in the Center-East DRDA (except for PY 1 which will be funded by IDA). No TA support will
be provided for extension at DRDA level, since an on-going MCD-financed pilot project already funds
two agronomists in each region with the aim of testing new agricultural techniques and methods of
extension. At neaotiations. assurances were obtained that the oilot activities will be transferred to the
resoective DRDAs no later than June 30. 1993.
3.39         Community develoament aoents will organize villagers around activities of common
interest, either economic (e.g. product processing, storing, marketing, input distribution, group
collateral for credit) or social (e.g. water point, health post). The service will not systematically
promote new groups that are to be institutionalized, but rather will support base organizations and
groups, with their largely informal character which are already found in many villages. In working
towards these objectives, community development staff will obtain the full involvement of the
communities in the UDR dialogue and planning process; provide organizatiorial and management
support to producer groups in running their affairs; and link up producer groups with DRDA services
and other specialized bodies that provide the type of inputs and assistance required by the group.
3.40         Aaricultural extension workers will provide technical assistance to farmers in response
to actual constraints and needs determined through a dialogue with the producers, and not merely



- 18-
deliver standard technical packages. They will relay technical themes formulated by the various
support services and specialized agencies in answer to producer demands (e.g. animal traction, agro-
forestry, improved crop and livestock husbandry, processing technologies) and will be supported by
technicians from those services. They will attend bi-monthly training sessions run by these specialists
on specific technical themes. They will work closely with research and will conduct farm trials to test
research results in farmers fields. They will also organize demonstration plots to train farmers in
proven techniques.
3.41         An inventory of technical themes of immediate relevance to farmers is on-going and
the MCD-financed pilot project is testing a number of these themes. It is expected that the initial focus
of extension will be on labor productivity improvement techniques, including better hand tools and
cultivation techniques, diffusion of Improved planting material, and better crop associations and
rotations. In addition, on cotton, efforts will focus on improving the use of inputs. At a more
advanced stage or sooner for progressive groups and farmers, extension will promote the increased
integration of crops and small stak, and the introduction of fodder crops and animal traction. In the
cotton areas there is considerable demand for animal traction under a shifting cultivatioeh pattern, for
both ploughing and transport. Extension will respond to this demand while research will in parallel
develop sedentary cropping patterns. Another important aspect of the extension message will concern
techniques and equipment for crop processing. Finally, in close coordination with the marketing
service, extension agents will promote diversification crops.
3.42         To achieve what is expected of them, extension workers will require a higher level of
skills than they have at present. For this reason, the new service will take over the best agents of the
previous SOCADA and ACADOP. Sector chiefs will be either engineer or experienced technicians.
Only the most experienced and aualified extension staff (technician level and above) will be recruited
for ACDA. Assurances to that effect were obtained at neaotiations.
3.43         The project will make a special effort to employ women as community development
(CD) agents and extension workers. This is necessary for project staff to establish direct collaboration
with women who perform the bulk of production and trade in food crops. Female CD and extension
agents can more easily establish a dialogue with village people of both genders than their male
colleagues. Furthermore these same women workers are better placed to appreciate the constraints
facing rural women, and the burden they carry. Finally, the presence of women on the staff of the
Government rural development service will be a recognition of the vital role of women in this country's
agriculture, and the best way of promotinp  greater share of responsibility and decision making power
for them in the context of their villages. 1 he tasks to be assigned to female staff will be no different
to those of their male colleagues and will cover the entire range of farming activities, and not be
confined to social or household problems.
3.44         Each Regional Directorate will comprise several technical sutwort services, comprised
of one senior technician and, where the workload warrants it, one assistant (Training, Animal Traction,
Marketing, Equipment and Input, Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Forestry). The Training Service will
organize all regular staff training as well as the special training programs for youths and villagers
described in paras 3.50 to 3.52. The Animal Traction Service, with one chief and 4 technicians
(stationed in the field) and one blacksmith trainer, will provide back up to extension workers in the area
of animal traction, organize related training courses, and liaise with other agencies for the supply of
complementary services to farmers and blacksmiths (credit and animal health).
3.45         The Rural Infrastructure Service will plan and supervise the rehabilitation and
maintenance of secondary and tertiary rural roads, and the construction and maintenance of tubewells,
which will be subcontracted to existing donor-funded road units or to private contractors. Tubewells
in the North-West DRDA will be provided under a parallel German-funded project. The Service will
provide organizational and technical support for the construction by villagers of tracks, village stores,



. 19-
water points etc. In order to promote the sedentarization of agriculture, starting in year 2, the service
will implement a program of destumping. A variety of destumping methods will be tested in project
year 1 to Identify the lower cost, most suitable technique. Village level infrastructure will be financed
by the grotups (in kind or cash), with or without credit, with the project contributing materials for social
infrastructure projects and subsidizing destumping (para 3.53).
3.46          The Marketing Service will be responsible for gathering price information on markets
and crop quantities via the network of field agents. It will organize periodic markets in responre to
farmers demand. It will provide marketing assistance to producer groups who organize themselves to
bulk their products for sale, putting them in contact with local traders. It wvill dissaminate improved
techniques and equipment for processing and storage and assist farmers and rural traders in obtaining
loans from the project credit unit. In all its activities the regional marketing service will be supported
by ACDA's central marketing service.
3.47          The Eauioment and Inout Servime- will receive centrally procured equipment and inputs
not easily available in the regions. These goods will be sold to farmer groups and traders, who in turn
will receive assistance in obtaining the required financing from the credit unit. Each DRDA will have
a store for input and equipment from which farmers groups and local traders will obtain needed
supplies unavailable in the area. Inputs and equipment will be sold at full cost and for cash (groups
and traders will have access to credit from a parallel source). It is expected that as demand for these
goods rises in the regions, local traders will increasingly supply the area, and the need for project
supplied inputs will dwindle.
3.48         In close coordination with research, the Aaro-Forestrv Service will help villagers
establish tree nurseries (fruit, fodder and other useful species), organize tree plantings for
environmental and productive purposes, and promote various agro-forestry packages (corridor planting,
vetiver grass etc.) for soil fertilization and conservation.
3.49          For all the required services, the groiect will provide for the costs of temporary
personnel, rehabilitation of existing buildings, minimum office facilities, vehicles and equipment,
operating costs, training and technical assistance. Mobility of field agents being essential, each
regional technical service will receive a vehicle, sector chiefs will each receive a motorcycle and
extension and CD agents will receive a motorbike. To encourage proper maintenance, motorcycles and
motorbikes will be sold to the respective staff who will receive an allowance in return.
Trainina Comoonent
1. Staff Trainina
3.50          In order to bring about a change of attitude among field service staff and cadre from
a dirigiste to a participatory mode, and to upgrade their skills, the project will provide an important
program of staff training. An initial orientation seminar will be provided to all ACDA personnel,
including two weeks for higher level staff, 3 weeks for medium level personnel, and 4 weeks for
extension and CD workers. The first category of personnel will train the second one and so on until
all levels have received initial training. Short-term assistance by consultants responsible for the design
of the project will be provided for the initial training of senior personnel. Thereafter, staff wi.l attend
one week training three times yearly on specific topics (e.g. animal traction, group management, agro-
forestry etc...). This formal training will come in addition to the on-the-job training provided bi-weekly
to field staff by senior technicians and to regional staff by ACDA national and expatriate senior
specialists. Initial staff training will be conducted at the existing, well equipped German-financed
training center (Bozoum). Thereafter, formal training will be conducted at two centers, one in each
DRDA (Poumbaidi and Bambari), which will be rehabilitated and equipped. Staff undergoing training
will receive transport and subsistence allowances.



- 20 -
2. Villagers Trainina
3.51          Villagers training will be carried out by the respective DRDA services, either directly or
through field agents. In addition, progressive farmers and group leaders will be invited to attend some
of the formal training sessions organized for staff. Training of blacksmiths, carpenters and bricklayers
will be done by existing NGOs with project funding and technical assistance as required. A project
financed specialist for blacksmiths will be hired for one year to develop a local training capacity in the
making of spare parts for cultivation equipment. Villagers will also receive technical information from
two other sources: (i} from video presentation made at village level by the audio-video team; and by
farmers visits organized by the DRDA to progressive farmers or groups, having adopted innovations
(for these visits, a bus is provided at each DRDA)
3. Youna Farmers Trainina
3.52         The project will run intensive training sessions for young literate farmers who are more
likely to be receptive to technical innovations. These schooled youths (boys and girls) have received
little experience of farming or business, and are back in the village for want of other productive
employment. They will be trained in improved agricultural methods, as well as in simple management
techniques, to help them start agricultural or related enterprises and run producer groups. Five simple
training centers will be established in existing rural facilities which will undergo light rehabilitation and
receive the required furniture and equipment. Trainees will attend 10 week sessions and will receive
a transport and subsistence allowance. Two agricultural technicians will be appointed in each centre.
DRDA specialist staff will be called upon to run courses for the centers trainers. A total of 1200 youth
are expected to be trained by the project among which about 300 young women (their smaller number
Is due to the limited number of schooled girls in rural areas). One expatriate technical adviser will be
recruited at project start for a period of two years to organize the youth training program.
Rural Infrastructure
3.53         The project will provide funding for several types of rural infrastructure investments,
including rural roads and tracks, destumping, and miscellaneous construction at viilage levels. The
program covers rehabilitation and maintenance of 500 km of primary rural roads, and 1,400 km of
secondary and tertiary rural roads; the construction of 2,200 km of tracks to link up rural transport of
crops by ox-cart; about 1,500 ha of destumping, using mechanical and manual techniques, current!y
being tested by the pilot project (para 3.41), and associated measures to prevent soil erosion; and
village level infrastructure, including stores for crops, shops and pharmacies, wells and market places.
With regard to village level infrastructure (destumping, small construction and tracks) the project will
provide technical and financial assistance as follows: in an effort to reduce shift-and-burn cultivation
which is destructive of the natural vegetation, and promote sedentary cropping, the project will
subsidize destumping and associated soil erosion control measures, up to a maximum of 50% of cost;
for collective infrastructure at village level, the project will provide plans and materials and the villagers
will supply labor; for individually owned village level infrastructure, the project will provide plans and
technical advice, the cost of materials being funded under the credit component; for village tracks, as
well as for manual maintenance of roads the project will provide tools to villagers groups, and will pay
them CFAF 10,000 per km. The village level infrastructure will be organized by the Infrastructure
Service of the respective DRDA.
3.54         Responsibility for the rural road sub-component will be split, in line with the
organizational arrangements embodied in the TSP. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the primary rural
roads will be the responsibility of the Rural Road Department of the MTP, including planning, standards
and specifications, procurement and control of the work- which will be carried out mainly by sub-
contractors (para. 3.70). The project financed program of primary rural roads will be fully consistent
with the Rural Road Masterplan, currently under preparation, and due to be ready in Septembbr 1992.



-21 -
To ensure consistency with the plan which will establish priorities based on economic criteria,
aareement has been reached at neaotiations that adoption bv Government of the Rural Road
Masterplan will be a condition of disbursement for the rural road component. Following completion
of the Masterplan, the program of primary rural roads will be integrated in the three year rolling
transport sector investment program, which is the object of yearly reviews by Government and Donors,
and permits efficient planning and budgeting of rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures.
3.55         Responsibility for the secondary and tertiary rural road sub-component will be the
responsibility of ACDA and its respective DRDAs, including planning, procurement and control of the
works. Standards and specifications will be prepared jointly with the Rural Road Department of MTP.
A rural infrastructure adviser will be provided under technical assistance at ACDA, to assist with
detailed planning, preparation of bidding documents and bid evaluation, and control of the works. A
consultant will be hired to liaise with the team in charge of the primary rural road Masterplan and to
finalize the program of secondary and tertiary rural roads, in line with the findings of the Plan.
Rural Credit INGO)
3.56         Most project activities will raise the credit demand for a variety of purposes:
a)    purchase by producers (and groups) of production, processing and transport equipment
(e.g. handtools, animal traction equipment; cassava mills, oil presses, drying mats,
wheelbarrows and carts);
b)    purchase of small stock, breeding poultry, and draft oxen;
c)    purchase of materials and tools by village craftsmen (e.g. blacksmiths, carpenters,
bricklayers);
d)    construction of crop storage facilities and village shops for inputs, consumer goods,
and essential drugs;
e)    provision of working capital for trading activities, village shops and pharmacies.
3.57         The credit component will follow the successful model developed by VITA and
supported by the micro-enterprise development component of the on-going Enterprise Rehabilitation
Project (Credit 2254-CA). The project will finance the cost of technical assistance for the credit
component (1 credit specialist for 5 years and 2 volunteers for 5 years for a total of US$500,000 and
will pass on US$170,000 to a suitable NGO on a grant basis for institutional support (minimum office
facilities, equipment and vehicles), and will make US$ 2.4 million available for on-lending to groups and
communities and young rural entrepreneurs on terms and conditions indicated below. The credit risk
will be borne by Government.
3.58         For the purposes of the rural credit component, Government will establish and maintain
a fund in a commercial bank (the Credit Fund) to receive the proceeds of the credit disbursed under
the credit component. The Credit Fund will be managed by the Credit NGO in accordance with a
management agreement that will include interalia the following:
a)    only farmers and small entrepreneurs from the DRDAs villages will be eligible
to receive loans;
b)    loans will be made for specific activities: purchase of production, processing
and transport equipment, agricultural inputs, destumping services, breeding



- 22 -
stock and draft oxen, and materials and tools for village craftsmen;
construction of storage facilities and village shops; and working capital for
shops and crop purchases;
c)    interest rates of 1 % to 4% per month depending on the duration and purpose
of the loan;
d)    maximum loan outstanding per individual borrower not to exceed $9,000;
e)    personal contribution of at least 25% of the investment cost, in cash or in kind;
f)    repayment periods of up to four years and an acceptable collateral which will
include group collateral;
g)    all funds accruing to the Credit Fund as a result of repayment of principal and
interests will be reused for the same purposes;
h)    an administration fee to be received by the NGO;
i)    decisions on loans to be taken solely by the NGO.
3.59         At nenotiations. assurances were obtained that MDR will enter into a management
agreement accentable to IDA which will include all of the above conditions. Loan conditions for young
rural entrepreneurs will be on softer terms (personal contribution reduced to a minimum of 10% and
repayment period extended to a maximum of 5 years) to take into account their inability to make a
sizeable downpayment. Interest rates of at least 12% per annum will be largely positive since local
inflation is hovering around 3% per year. To ensure that these remain positive in the future, the
agreement wiil provide for an annual review of interest rates by IDA. The management agreement will
be for a 1 0-year program and will provide that the NGO will return to Government at the termination
of the program the Pmount of US$2.4 million plus interest minus administrative fee and losses from
credit operations. Should the NGO manaaement aureement be terminated or suspended or adversely
affected. credit disbursements would be suspended.
3.60         The NGO staff implementing the credit component will collaborate with field staff who
will be responsible for identifying credit needs, helping farmers form groups that can be granted loans
and, generally, facilitating contact between producer groups and the credit institution. However, final
decision to grant a loan, and the credit recovery, will be the entire responsibility of the NGO. Seminars
and training courses for field staff will be organized by the NUO to prepare them to support farmers
and their groups in loan application.
3.61         Loans will be granted to individuals with group collateral, the group forwarding the
applications of its members to the credit institution. Group pressure is proven to be the best means
of ensuring a satisfactory repayment rate. By insisting on group responsibility, the VITA run credit
scheme is obtaining repayment rates of 98%. Group credit will be granted for certain community
activities (e.g. financing group marketing, or the purchase of equipment for collective use). All types
of groups, whether they bring together the entire village or only some of the people, will be eligible to
obtain credit provided they show social cohesion and offer group guarantees judged sufficient by the
credit office, and the activity they propose to engage in is financially viable. This attempt to structure
the rural world for credit distribution will be an important first step in the long term process of building
rural financial institutions. Based upon the experience acquired in the first project years, the mid-term
review will assess the possibility of having these groups evolve Into savings and credit associations.



- 23 -
3.62         Four credit offices will be established, two in each DRDA. Each will have a loan officer,
who will be assisted by an expatriate volunteer supplied by the NGO for five years. The activities of
these offices will be supervised by an agricultural credit officer who will be supported by a rural credit
specialist for five years. Under project financing, Government will provide the NGO staff with vehicles
and office fumiture and equipment necessary for their task.
Prqiect Coordination
3.63         Project Coordination will be the responsibility of the MDR minister. The Minister will
be assisted in his tasks by the related MDR services (DGPES) and by a financial coordintor for tll
matters related to project finance and administration. At negotiations. assurances were obtained that
a proiect financial coordinator whose experience and aualifications are acceotable to IDA will be
retained under technical assistance for the duration of the Droiect. Aooointment of the financial
coordinator Is a condition of Credit effectiveness. At project start, the financial coordinator will be
responsible for administering the compensation scheme for staff affected by the restructuring of
SOCADA and the creation of ICRA and ACDA (para 3.36). Other functions of the financial coordinator
include training MDR, ICRA, and ACDA staff concerned with project administration, review and
approval of budgets, review of procurernent documents and procedures, review of expenditures and
preparation of disbursement applications, consolidation of quarterly project progress reports, liaison
with donors on administrative matters, and administering the consultarncy budget for implementation
assistance. At neaotiations. assurances were obtained that work oroarams and budoets for the
agencies in charoe of oroiect implementation (MDR. ICRA. ACDA. MTP and NGO) will be submitted
to IDA no later than October 31 of each calendar year. All documents forwarded to IDA for review
or approval will be sent automatically to all cofinanciers.
3.64         After Board Presentation, an external firm will be selected under PPF financing to set
up th; project accounts and management information systems. Hiring of the firm is a condition of
ffeciiveness. Funds will be provided to hire a management controller (3 man-months/year) for the
entire duration of the project, and for hiring auditors to carry out the annual audits of project accounts
(para. 3.77). Auditors will be hired externally. Management control services will be hired locally from
a private auditing firm. Short-term implementation assistance (10 man-months) by outside consultants
Is also provided for to help project management deal with particular implementation issues as they
arise. In the first year of the project, these funds will serve to hire an infrastructure specialist to revise
the rural road sub-component in line with the Rural Road Masterplan (2 man-months) and a credit
specialist to assist In the drafting of the management agreement between the NGO and Government.
In addition, short-term consultants will be brought in with these funds to run a project start up seminar,
that will cover technical as well as procurement and disbursement aspects.
3.65         Supervision of this multi-component project is expected to require 20 sw in projet year
one, and 15 sw thereafter (Annex 10). It will be carried out mainly by the agronomist who is stationed
at the Bank Resident Mission in Bangui (15 sw In project year 1 an 10 sw thereafter). Additional
support from headquarters in financial aspects will need to be provided yearly (4 sw) as well as support
from the Infrastructure division (1 sw annually) to supervise the primary rural road sub-component.
Additional support for project supervision will be provided by other donors, who will participate in the
periodic formal supervision missions mounted by the Bank. UNDP, with its Resident Mission in Bangui,
will play a key role in the coordination and supervision of technical assistance. A table of key
indicators that will serve to guide the work of the supervision missions is in Annex 11.
3.66         At negotiations. assurances were obtained that a oroiect mid-term review will be carried
oui no later than September 30. 1995 and specific elements of the project on which the review will
focus have been agreed upon. The mid-term review will be carried out jointly by Govemment and
donors and will assess: {i) the pace of implementation relative to target; (ii) progress made and
problems encountered In Implementing the various project components; (iii) the effectiveness of the



- 24-
new extension and community development service; (iv) involvement of the beneficiaries in project
implementation; (v) impact of the new rural development approach on the beneficiaries; (vi) efficiency
of credit scheme; and (vii) performance of technical assistance, project management and of the M&E
system. Project success will be assessed based on the number of village level investments, whether
in agricultural production, collective infrastructure or artisanal and trade businesses.
C.      Proiect Costs and Financina
Proiect Costs
3.67            Base costs in January 1992 prices are CFAF 12.0 billion (US$42.8 million) over 5
years. Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, but excluding taxes, are
estimated at CFAF 13.2 billion (US$ 46.9 million), including CFAF 7.3 billion (US$26.2 million) in
foreign exchange (61 % of the total cost). Total costs include 3% physical contingencies for all
expenditures but salaries. Price contingencies, applied to costs inclusive of physical contingencies, are
calculated assuming: (i) a rate of inflation of 3.4% p.a. on foreign costs (in accordance with World
Bank guidelines); and (ii) rate of inflation of 3% p.a. on local costs. The estimated cost for technical
assistance, inclusive of travel and subsistence allowance, is estimated at US$10,000 per man-month
to US$12,000 per man-months. The cost of the project is summarized in the table which follows
(details are in Annex 7 and in Volume 11).

3.69            The project has been designed in such a way that, after a period of relatively intensive
support during the UDR planning phase and in the Initial implementation phase of the UDR plan,
villagers groups would progressively take charge of their own development, allowing intensive support
from the field service to move on to other villages. Hence the substantial reduction in the number of
field staff from about 350 prior to the project to about 230 with the project, despite an increase in the
number of villagers reached by the service ( from 70,000 to 125,000). This approach keeps the
recurrent costs at a reasonable level (CFAF 1.03 billion or US$3.7 million at the end of the project).
This amount covers salaries of nationals, allowances, and operating costs for ICRA, ACDA and the
North-West and Center-East DRDAs as well as MDR operating budget only. Of this, only CFAF 537
million (US$1.9 million) would represent non-salary operating costs and would be extemally financed.
While these non-salary expenditures represent core public sector programs in support of the country'
main productive sector, Govemment is not today in a position to fund those out of its own resources.
Even though adjustment is on-going to improve public sector finance, the core government recurrent
budget Is expected to require external assistance over the medium term.

Procurement
3.70            There will be no nejw construction of buildings, merely rehabilitation of existing ones.
The size of works will be small, involving about 10 contracts of US$100,000 each, for a total of US$
1 million, of which US$0.8 million would be IDA financed. These would be unlikely to attract foreign
firms. Competent local firms are available and contracts for the construction of buildings for the
project will therefore be put out to local competitive bidding (LCB) following procedures acceptable to
IDA, i.e. including local advertising, public bid opening, ciear and precise evaluation criteria, award to
lowest bidder and non-exclusion of foreign bidder who may wish to participate. The first LCB
document used will be sent to IDA for review. Construction of rural roads (US$ 10.8 million) will be
for rehabilitation (about 1,900 km), mechanical maintenance (400 km), construction of village tracks
(2,250 k1m), and manual maintenance (2,800 km). There are two large sections of roads that will
undergo heavy rehabilitation (240 km in the North West DRDA, and 330 km in the Center East DRDA).
These works will be the object of two contracts, valued at a total of US$3.6 million, which will be put
out to ICB. Light rehabilitation of rural roads, including 520 km in the North-West DRDA and 780 km
in the Center East DRDA, will involve a number of small contracts to be carried out over the five-year
project period. These smaller contracts (below US$1 million individually) amount to a total value of
US$5.8 million, of which US$2.6 million will be financed by IDA. The IDA-financed portion of those
contracts will be let under LCB. The balance of the rural roads works are very small and located in
remote areas where the contractors are not likely to participate. These will be done by force account.



* 27 -
The credit will contribute to the financing of these works up to a maximum amount of US$1.4 million
through the provision of Inputs eligible for financing. Force account works will be carried out by
existing public sector road construction units in the area, one whose equipment was financed by the
German, the other by the Japanese. Small rural infrastructure and maintenance at village level (US$0.4
million) will be done by the villagers. The progress reports (para. 3.77) will Include a section on
contracting, especially for civil works, that specifies the value of the works and the agregate amounts
(commitments and actual expenditures) for each of the above categories (ICB, LCB, force account).
They will also indicate the quantities of work completed and will therefore permit a follow-up on unit
costs of works done by contract and by force account.
3.71         All vehicles (US$1.5 million) will be procured through ICB, except for 6 vehicles
(US$0.2 million) that will be needed right away at project start that will be procured through LCB In
accordance with the same procedures as above. To the extent possible, contracts for equipment
(totalling US$1.0 million) will be grouped to constitute a sufficiently important contract for ICB.
Contracts for equipment and motorcycles with a value of US$ 100,000 or more will put out to ICB.
Contracts with a value less than US$ 100,000 but more than US$ 50,000 will be procured following
acceptable LCB procedures. Small purchases for items costing less than US$ 50,000 will be awarded
using prudent shopping procedures on the basis of pro forma invoices from three different contractors.
Small purchases for items costing less than USS 1,000 can be made of the shelf. The latter two will
apply mainly to office supplies. Prior review of bidding documents by IDA will be required for all
contracts in excess of US$ 100,000. About 40% of all contracts are expected to be subject to prior
review by IDA. Bank sample documents will be used for procurement of goods, works and
consultants.
3.72         Technical assistance and studies will be awarded to one or several firms in accordance
with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. IDA-financed technical
assistance includes 18 man-years of long term TA, 8 man-years of long term Volunteers and 62 man-
months of short-term TA for a total of US$3.7 million. The balance of technical assistance (US$5.8
million) will be provided under grants. A joint UNDP/Bank mission visited the CAR in February 1992,
and formulated detailed Terms of Reference for the technical assistance component. The credit NGO
will also be selected In accordance with the Guidelines. Experience in administering rural credit will
be a pre-requisite and knowledge of low Income African countries desirable. Short- and medium-term
loans for farmers and traders or their groups, will be made available in conformity with agreements
entered Into with the credit NGO. Credit will be for equipment, material and supplies for a variety of
farming and artisanal activities (para. 3.54). These will be procured by individual borrowers through
established commercial practices. The expenditures incurred will be monitored by the credit NGO.
Costs of training, Inclusive of the per diem allowances for those attending the courses, will be paid
directly to the beneficiaries while operating expenses will be dealt with through local procedures which
are acceptable to IDA. Operating costs Include building maintenance and utilities, vehicle maintenance
and running expenditures, housing and transport allowances, wages for temporarily hired personnel
(drivers, guards and research farm laborers), office and research laboratory supplies, and personnel
expenditures related to the restructuring of SOCADA (para. 3.42).
3.73         On-going sectoral projects, in particular the recently started Natural Resource
Management project, are suffering from occasional procurement difficulties, which are due to a lack
of training and understanding of Bank procedures. To alleviate this problem, a Seminar on Bank
Procurement (and Disbursement) Is planned to be held In Bangui, with the contribution of Bank
specialized personnel in late 1992. In addition, some of the ten man-months of Implementation
assistance provided for under the Project (para. 3.64) will go towards supporting project staff in
handling procurement matters at the start of the project.

Disbursements
3.74           The IDA Credit will be disbursed over 7 years, corresponding to the disbursement profile
of rural development projects in Africa, shortened by one year because the project contains no lumpy
investment and because efforts will be made to alleviate disbursement problems. On-going projects,
especially the newer ones, are experiencing dis.awrsement delays, due to incompletely documented
disbursement applications. To assist the responsible CAR staff, a Bank disbursement mission visited
the CAR in August 1991. The above mentioned Procurement and Disbursement Seminar is aimed at
addressing the problem in a systematic manner for all sectors. The proposed Credit disbursement
categories and relevant percentages are shown below. The closing date will be December 31, 1999.

3.75           A Special Account will be opened by the Borrower at a commercial bank prior to credit
effectiveness for IDA disbursements against project expenditures. Where payments for contracts are
to be made out of the Special Account, two copies of the contract will be furnished to IDA prior to the
first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such contract. After effectiveness and ,n the
basis of a written request from the Borrower, IDA will deposit the equivalent of US$ 700,0U0 in the
Special Account.
3.76           Disbursements will be on full documentation except for those based on statements of
expenditures (SOEs), which will be used for contracts costing less than US$20,000; and for all other
expenditures, below US$10,000. SOEs will provide clear information on description of goods, country
of origin, date and currency of payment, commercial banks involved, and beneficiaries. SOEs will be
certified by the Financial Coordinator and signed by the Minister MDR or his appointed representative
from whom specimen of signature will have been forwarded to IDA. SOEs will be subject to specific
reviews by auditors. Supporting documentafion (invoices, customs declaration and evidence of
payment) will be retained by MDR for examination by IDA missions.

Accounts. Auditina and Reporting
3.77         The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) under the supervision of the Minister MDR, will be
responsible for overall administration and financial control of the project, while the financial and
administrative service of each beneficiary agency (MDR, ICRA, ACDA, NGO) will be in charge of
keeping accounts for their respective components, in conformity with the Guidelines for Financial
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank. An annual program of activities and
budget will be submitted to IDA for review at the latest two months prior to the start of each fiscal
year (para. 3.61). The locally recruited management controller will be responsible for monitoring
budget performance as the year proceeds, and will submit written reports at least quarterly to the MDR
Minister. At neaotiations. assurances were obtained that: (a) the woiect accounts. SOEs and the
Snecial Account will be audited annually by auditors accentable to IDA: lb) the audit reports will be
submitted to IDA no later than four months after the close of each financial Year: and (c} the Proiect
Coordinator's office will submit bi-annual oroaress regorts and a report on the overall oroiect
implementation and achievements to IDA within six months of the orgiect closina date.
3.78         Two operations are experiencing serious audit delays, the Economic Management
Project and the Third Structural Adjustment Program, with overdue audits of 17 and 5 months for EMP
and 8 months for SAL3. Regional Management sent a reminder letter to the Borrower dated December
6, 1991. Government has since recruited auditors to provide the required services and audits are
underway. Audit reports are due to IDA by June 30, 1992.
IV. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
4.01         The immediate justification of the project lies in the building of stronger, better
coordinated agricultural institutions which will operate at a lower cost than the sum total of the
fragmented donor-funded agencies which prevailed so far (para. 4.02). The ultimate justification and
measure of success however are the improvements in the livelihood of rural people whose quality of
life and productive output are to be raised by project interventions (para. 4.04); and the country's
economic gains from increased agricultural and artisanal activities and a growing monetary rural
economy (para. 4.06).
Institutional Benefits
4.02         The restructuring of SOCADA, including the lay off of about 200 agents, the elimination
of certain duplication between SOCADA and ACADOP, and the doubling of the area covered by
PRODEROM staff (the latter being supported by the parallel IFAD-funded project) will all result in
greater efficiency of operations by reducing the public sector cost of providing services to farmers.
The largest economies will come from the lower ratio of field staff to farmers ( 1:500 instead of 1:200)
made possible by the adoption of the participatory rural development approach, and lower overheads
due the reduced number of agency headquarters. The annual recurrent budget of the new support
service in the heretofore SOCADA area will be 58% of the old one, with the following breakdown:
expenditures on extension, training and other field activities will be 65%, research expenditures at
78% of prior levels (though research will be expanded to cover areas not adequately covered now),
and overheads expenditures only 28 % of prior levels (details are in Annex 8).
4.03.        Emphasis on training, the release of less qualified personnel and the upgrading of
technical skills of the remaining staff, together with the reorganization of operating procedures under
the multidisciplinary team approach will establish an efficient advisory service closely in tune with, and
responsive to the evolving needs of rural communities. The close association between the extension
advi4ers and adaptive research staff during UDR discussions with communities will help to identify



- 30 -
topics for the adaptive research program. Producers, extension advisers and research staff will be in
frequent contact during training visits to sub-stations and farm trials providing ample opportunity for
two-way information flow thus ensuring that the research program will remain focused on issues of
immediate relevance to the various sectors of the target group.
Socio-Economic Benefits
4.04         Some 900,000 persons in approximately 160,000 rural households living in the North-
West and Center-East DRDAs are potential beneficiaries of the activities of the field service during the
project period. They constitute a fairly homogeneous poverty group with incomes considerably below
the national average of US$410 per capita. Household incomes are estimated to range between
170,000 CFAF (31 ,OOOCFAF or US$106 per capita) for traditional shifting cultivators, using handtools
and no inputs, to 315,000 CFAF (57,000 CFAF or USS 195 per capita) for farmers using animal
traction under a shifting cultivation pattern. The numbers of villages, groups and individual producers
gaining direct benefits from agricultural support programs (through credit for productive investment,
incorporation of improved planting materials in their farming system, adoption of modified crop and
livestock husbandry practices, and increased involvement in the market economy) is hard to predict.
It will depend upon the degree of success of the community participation approach and the ability of
the project to generate revenue earning opportunities, the latter dependent in turn on uncertain
markets.
4.05         The adaptive research program is expected to concentrate on the development of
technologies which increase returns to labour, minimize labour requirements, and reduce the time
needed for processing crop products through the introduction of appropriate, small-scale processing
equipment. Since women provide the majority of labour for foodcrop maintenance and processing, the
successful extension of such technologies is expected to be of particular benefit to women by reducing
their work load and freeing time for alternative activities. Such benefits will be supplemented by time
savings for women through project funded investments in more efficient access to markets.
4.06         The introduction of processing equipment, storage improvements and non-traditional
crops to create a greater diversity of marketing opportunities, will broaden the economic base at local
level, increase local revenues and further stimulate interest in the establishment of small businesses
to meet the expanding demand for domestic supplies and services. The promotion of artisanal
activities will respond to this growing demand for services and by stimulating exchange at the local
level between food producers and providers of services, it will set in motion a process of self-sustaining
development based on specialization and trade at the local level.
4.07         Under the modified extension and community participation programs, staff will increase
their contact with all sections of the -community including women and youths. The community will be
encouraged to publicly identify its own agents of innovation for testing newly demonstrated
technology, many of whom are likely to be women (in relation to crop storage or processing
developments) or educated youths more willing to take what may be perceived as risks by more
conservative elements in society. Such an approach, coupled with a more intensive training of the
youth, both boys and girls, is expected to generate a greater and more sustainable increase in the
adoption of alternative production techniques than the traditional approach of expecting a trickle down
effect from externally identified pilot farmers.
4.08         Through the community participation approach, and the resultant increased tendency
for group formation, communities will become increasingly efficient in planning and managing their own
affairs and articulating their needs to relevant support services, and become better placed to take
advantage of facilities such as credit and alternative market opportunities. At the same time, the
increasing demands placed on available support services in rural areas, will provide a continuing
stimulus to private entrepreneurs and Government institutions to increase and sustain their efficiency
and effectiveness.

Acricultural Production Benefit
4.09         The nature of the incremental production will be influenced by the findings of the
specific market surveys, and the feasibility of product diversification in the different project sub-areas.
Cotton, the main cashcrop of the area will be further developed in pace with productivity
improvements, both at farm and factory level. The main effort though will lie in product diversification.
A range of crops will be promoted on a larger or smaller scale depending on market opportunities and
the development potential identified in the different UDRs. This includes at least the following: cassava
(plain or processed into gari or atieke), other tubers (yams, sweet potato, taro, potatoes), rainfed rice,
groundnuts (table and possibly oil varieties), cowpeas, sesame, soya and niebe, as well as fruit, and
garden produce (including vegetable consumed by the expatriate community). Incremental meat
production (poultry, small ruminants), and bee wax and honey are also expected to increase. A share
of the incremental production would stay within the household, thus contributing to a better, more
diversified diet. The rest would be sold thereby contributing tc increase the monetary income of cash
poor rural household and monetize further the economy. Pilot export diversification projects (in tropical
fruits, essential oils and spices and semi-processed products) will provide income opportunities for
some of the more entrepreneurial farmers and local traders.
4.10         Since the project is designed to respond flexibly to site and time specific market
opportunities, the nature and amount of incremental production cannot be forecast within an
acceptable probability range. Based on past experience, it is anticipated that about half the farmers
will be receptive to innovations promoted by the extension service. Of these, a majority may be
expected to equip themselves with better handtools and to increase their productivity by planting
higher yielding lgcal selections with demonstrated tolerance to major pests and diseases. In addition
a substantial number of farmers may be expected to adopt modified crop husbandry practices in
conjunction with either traditional crops or a combination of traditional and alternative crops identified
through the adaptive research program (e.g. cowpeas, soya beans, fruit trees). Among those, cotton
farmers will make greater use of inputs as other production constraints have been lifted. About
10,000 farmers can be expected to adopt animal cultivation in addition, thereby increasing their farmed
area as well as yields, and a few among those to adopt permanent cropping. Three farm models are
presented in Annex 9 for illustrative purposes.
4.11         Future market outlets for the food crop production of the project area will depend to
a large extent on the growth of demand in urban centers, especially in Bangui. The growth rate of
urban population in CAR is estimated at about 4.5% per year. Assuming that this growth rate will be
maintained and that effective demand for food by urban consumers will grow accordingly, the Bangui
market will increase by 50% in less than ten years. This will benefit areas closest to the capital while
the more remote p;oduction areas would benefit from a more diversified economic environment at the
local level (including exchange with artisans as well as livestock producers, and exporters to
Cameroon). Other potential market outlets for additional crop production from the project area may
also include various agro-industrial units concerned with groundnut oil production (HUSACA), maize
for animal feed (FNEC), possible import substitution of rice, etc... Since national markets will remain
limited however, market surveys and pilot projects will actively investigate foreign outlets.
Environmental Benefits
4.12         The project will have an overall beneficial impact on the environment. With its
emphasis on the development of technology for sustainable increases in productivity (improved fallows,
crop rotations and closer integration of crop and livestock), the project is expected to have a positive
effect on soil fertility. Increased production from areas farmed under traditional shifting cultivation
practices will minimize the need for larger areas to be cultivated to provide for home consumption
needs. An expansion in the area cultivated by farmers adopting alternative cropping patterns and/or



- 32 -
the use of animal traction in association with the increased commercialization of agriculture, will lead
to an expansion of the area under cultivation. However, cropping in these areas involves the removal
of only few trees per ha. Cropping in the few gallery forests existing in these areas will be prohibited.
Enforcement does not pose great difficulties in view of the abundance of empty land suitable for
cropping. Agro-forestry activities, including the planting of trees around farmers fields and villages will
more than offset tree removal as a result of the expanding cultivated areas. Finally, soil improvement
grasses, bushes and trees will be promoted.
4.13         The major risks associated with the project relate to the willingness of communities to
invest In crop and livestock production, and the degree to which technical staff appreciate and can
implement the new approach. Therefore the success of the program relies upon three major criteria:
-     the creation of an economic environment which would encourage producers to invest
labour in crop/livestock production to generate sustainable production and productivity
increases;
-     the capacity of staff to work with communities, analyze the problems of the productive
sector environment, and respond to the technical demands arising from field
investigations; and
-     the continuing capacity of the support services to privide the financial means (credit)
and technical support for farmers to invest.
The project will have to focus on each of these aspects simultaneously and appreciate their
interrelationships as they influence production at farm and community levels; hence the importance
of the multidisciplinary approach as the basic framework for the project.
4.14         With a few isolated exceptions, marketing of produce is a major factor currently limiting
production. Even with improved market links, the scope for increased production of traditional
products is limited, both by the scale of national demand and the competitive effects of imports from
neighboring countries. The marketing service and the adaptive research program are therefore
expected to give priority to identifying alternative products derived from traditional crops and to
illustrate the potential of crop diversification; and the field staff, through their closer involvement with
communities, will have to give equal priority to demonstrating the attractiveness of alternative
products.
4.15         A further risk element is the continued ability of Government to provide adequate
finance for extension and adaptive research from its own resources once donor support ceases.
Despite on-going macro-economic adjustment efforts, CAR has a substantial remaining deficit whose
resolution depends to some extent upon external factors. Even when account is taken of further
adjustment measures expected from the CAR, the existing recurrent budget will continue to require
external assistance for some time. Taking this constraint into account, the project has been designed
to reduce operating costs of state services and create the opportunity to maximize the communities'
own responsibilities for development.

Footnotes
1)     Comparison is made with SOCADA in 1988 for the following reasons:
-      SOCADA had undergone a first program of cost reduction which had
eliminated the most obvious inefficiencies and wastes;
SOCADA was still carrying out a program of development activities, which
was later reduced to the minimum required to support cotton production,
and to research.
2)     Recurrent expenditures exclude technical assistance which, being of a temporary
nature aimed at on-the-job training of nationals, is considered as an investment.
3)     Rural development expenditures include extension, training, animal traction and
other support (e.g. marketing in the case of ACDA).
4)     Annual recurrent expenditures of DRDA North-West (CFAF 193 million) and DRDA
Center-East (CFAF 185 million).
5)     2/3 of ICRA's expenditures (CFAF 337 million) are included under the assumption
that 2/3 of ICRA's work program is relevant to the cotton area savanna.
6)     only 2/3 of ACDA's annual recurrent expenditures (CFAF 139 million) are Included
since, over the project period, ACDA will provide support to a third DRDA (Center-
West), funded under the parallel IFAD financed project.
