F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document [PAD])
The project assisted the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in the implementation of its
Strategic Investment Plan (SIP), 2003-2010, for the Health, Nutrition & Population
Support Program (HNPSP) with support from a large group of Development Partners
(DPs) through a Sector-wide Approach (SWAp). The main purpose of the SIP was to
increase the availability and utilization of user-centered, effective, efficient, equitable,
affordable and accessible quality services be it the Essential Services Package, improved
hospital services, nutritional services or other selected services. To achieve these
objectives, the program focused on three major reform areas: (i) Strengthening Public
Health Sector Management and Stewardship Capacity, through development of pro-poor
targeting measures as well as strengthening sector-wide governance mechanisms; (ii)
Health Sector Diversification, through the development of new delivery channels for
publicly and non-publicly financed services; and (iii) Stimulating Demand for essential
services by poor households through health advocacy and demand-side financing options.

Revised Project Development Objectives (PDO)
The PDO as described in the PAD was not changed. During the Mid-Term Review
(MTR), the Results Framework (RFW) was changed and the change was approved as part
of a Regional Vice President level restructuring in October 2009.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
In spite of being regularly affected by natural disasters and being one of the poorest and
most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh sustained high rates of
economic growth with considerable improvements in social indicators over the two
decades preceding this project. As such, the country was well on the way to achieving
many of the Health Nutrition and Population (HNP) related Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs).

Notwithstanding the achievements gained in the past years, Bangladesh faced an
unfinished agenda of systemic problems, originally identified in the Health and
Population Sector Strategy of 1997. In 1998, the strategy was translated into a five-year
program, the Health and Population Sector Program (HPSP), which had marked a shift
from multiple individual project approach to a single health Sector Wide Approach
(SWAp). While key health outcomes had improved under HPSP, albeit at a faltering rate,
the GOB‘s agenda of systemic reform could not be completed.

At the appraisal of HNPSP, key issues faced by the sector included:

      Health Inequalities. Despite improvements in health indicators, the gap in health
       conditions between the rich and the poor remained high. There remained wide
       inequity, with children in the poorest households being more than twice as likely to
       be moderately malnourished, and four times as likely to be severely malnourished as
       children from the richest households. There was a pressing need to better address the
       health rights of poor people by targeting consumption subsidies and restructuring
       allocation mechanisms based on population and poverty indices.

      The Dynamics of Public and Non Public Health Service Provision. In Bangladesh,
       total annual per capita spending on health averaged US$12, of which only US$ 4
       came from the public sector and the bulk (65%)11 was funded from household out-of-
       pocket sources. Up to a third of the public budget on health was provided by DPs
       during 1998-2003. Almost half of the households used the non-public sector for
       treatment compared to only 10% who used the public sector. The remaining used
       traditional sources of care.

      Quality Health Care. Most services were provided by the non-public sector, more
       specifically by local unregistered, traditional practitioners, largely in a poorly
       regulated environment. Developing feasible and acceptable strategies for regulating
       and enforcing regulation of quality and volume was critical for health services and
       pharmaceuticals.

   The sector was plagued by serious governance issues such as staff absenteeism,
    pilferage, extracting illegal payments from patients, and so forth.

   The Changing Epidemiology. In addition to the increasing incidence of injuries,
    accidents (drowning were the leading cause of mortality for the 1-5 year olds) and a
    growing risk of spread of Human Immuno-deficiency Virus/ Acquired Immune
    Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), Hepatitis B and C, amongst non-communicable
    diseases (NCD), cancer and cardio-vascular diseases were the leading causes of
    morbidity and mortality.

   The HNP needs of Marginalized Groups: Gender, disability, age, type of disease and
    cultural differences were the basis for discrimination, access and utilization of HNP
    services in Bangladesh. Poor women and children, especially those from tribal
    populations were being poorly served by the existing system, as were people with
    disabilities, the elderly, adolescents and HIV/AIDS patients.

Maintaining the status quo was not the solution for Bangladesh, and the Government
stated its intention to reform the HNP system through its Strategic Investment Plan (SIP),
and proposed to significantly increase the level of spending on HNP. This intention
confirmed GOB’s commitment to pro-poor health service provision and to address the
need to reappraise the essential core functions of the public sector.

Under the SIP, new areas of focus were proposed which included a comprehensive
approach to nutrition programming, introduction of demand side financing pilots,
enhanced stewardship role of the government, developing incentives for health workers,
and performance-based financing mechanisms. The SIP also laid out four broad policy
directions that would have an impact on reducing health inequalities: (a) shifting
resource allocations to poorer districts (or districts with poor health outcomes; (b)
targeting and demand side subsidies to explore alternative ways of reaching to the poor;
(c) diversification of service provision to improve the quality and coverage of HNP
services through public-private partnerships; and (d) intersectoral collaboration to create
linkages between the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and other
ministries and programs which would have direct impact on the health status of the poor.

The Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program (HNPSP) was designed to address
the above mentioned challenges and built upon the lessons learnt from the first health
sector SWAp (HPSP). Under the new HNPSP (2005-2011), seven DPs (DfID, CIDA,
EU, Sida, KfW, The Netherlands and UNFPA) contributed financing jointly with the
International Development Association (IDA), and participated in joint implementation
support activities, keeping in line with the signed Partnership Arrangement. The DPs set-
up a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) with the Bank to support the Government’s SWAp
which was disbursed as co-financing with the Bank project. The total cost of HNPSP was
US$4.3 billion (the “Program?), of which US$3.1 billion was GOB funding and US$1.2
billion in DP funding. Of the DP funding, US$687.98 million was pooled funds (the
“Project? which comprised of the MDTF of US$387.98 million and IDA credit of
US$300 million) and the remaining US$512 million was parallel funding. During the



                                            2
implementation of the program, the Bank administered the MDTF on behalf of the
pooling partners and ensured fiduciary oversight of the funds spent. The MDTF included
two portions – one executed by GOB, the other by the Bank for supervision of MDTF
and undertaking analytical and advisory activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The project was intended to assist the GOB in the implementation of its Strategic
Investment Plan (SIP) 2003-2010, for the HNPSP in cooperation with a large group of
DPs through a SWAp mechanism.

The PDO of the project, as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and in the
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs), was to “Increase the availability and
utilization of user centered, effective, efficient, equitable, affordable and accessible
quality HNP services?. The project was monitored using this PDO and was measured by
the indicators outlined in the PAD and later revised during project restructuring in 2009.
(See the ICR datasheet for details).

It should be noted that the objective of the project, as stated in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA), differed from the description of the PDO in the PAD. The DCA


                                            3
states that “The objective of the Project, which is an integral part of the HNPSP is, inter
alia to: (i) reduce infant, under-five child and maternal mortality and the proportion of
malnourished children; (ii) eliminate the gender disparity in child malnutrition and
mortality; (iii) ensure increased access to reproductive health services; (iv) lower total
fertility with a view towards achieving replacement level by 2010; (v) reduce the burden
of tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, malaria and other priority diseases; (vi) initiate a system
to control newer health threats and protect health risks by improving emergency services;
and (vii) improve the prevention and control of NCDs. These goals are consistent with
the overall objectives of the HNPSP, as presented in the PAD, and were monitored by the
overall HNPSP indicators, as presented in Annex 9 of this ICR.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
During the restructuring of the project in 2009 at the Regional Vice President level, one
PDO indicator (Proportion of total MOHFW expenditure allocated to the 25% poorest
districts) was replaced by “Proportion of MOHFW expenditure at the Upazila level and
below?. This change better reflected MOHFW’s regular monitoring and was a more
realistic way of measuring the pro-poor resource allocation. Another PDO indicator
(Utilization rate of Essential Service Delivery [ESD] of the two lowest income quintiles)
was modified to better reflect improvements in two specific essential health services
related to maternal health (i.e. skilled assistance during delivery and antenatal care
(ANC) by medically trained provider), as follows: “Utilization rate of ESD of the two
lowest income quintiles: (a) Delivery attended by skilled personnel, and (b) ANC
coverage by medically trained provider?. In addition, during restructuring, two
intermediate outcome (IO) indicators were deleted and three IO indicators were added to
ensure better monitoring and better alignment with the project components and to better
measure the PDO. Likewise, during restructuring, the GOB’s Results Framework was
also changed to reduce the number of indicators from the original 62 to 30 indicators. See
Section below on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) for a detailed outline of these
changes.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The entire population of Bangladesh was to benefit from this project, with a special focus
on the vulnerable population groups, e.g. the poor, women, children and the elderly.

1.5 Original Components
The project had three components, which were closely interlinked. While the first
component focused on objectives for service delivery in the classical primary health care
domain and achieving the HNP MDG, the second was to develop policies and strategies
to the changing disease burden due to urbanization and aging of the population. The third
component was to address major policy reforms and strategies in order to achieve better
equity and efficiency in the HNP sector. Disaggregated component costs were not
specified.

Component 1: Accelerating achievement of HNP-related MDG and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) goals. The component was intended to support the delivery of a



                                            4
package of essential services. The ESD would focus on (a) reduction of maternal
mortality; (b) reduction of neonatal mortality; (c) reduction in childhood morbidity and
mortality; (d) improvement in the nutritional status particularly of adolescent girls,
pregnant and lactating women and children; (e) reducing fertility to replacement level;
and (f) reducing the burden of TB and malaria and preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS.

Component 2: Meeting emerging HNP sector challenges. This component was intended
to support the development of policies and strategies for emerging challenges, with a
focus on: (a) reduction of injuries and implementing improvements in emergency
services; (b) prevention and control of major NCDs; (c) urban health service
development; and (d) improvement of the HNP response to disasters.

Component 3: Advancing HNP sector modernization. This component was intended to
address the following health, nutrition and population (HNP) reforms:

Public health sector management and stewardship capacity: Improving sector
management would focus on improving institutional and personal skills for (i) better
planning and monitoring; (ii) improved budget management through a medium term
budgetary framework (MTBF) process; (iii) reform management; (iv) improved aid
management; (v) development of proper contract documents and management of
contracts with private and non-government organization (NGO) providers; (vi)
information management; and (vii) development of alternative financing mechanisms.
Major targets were established and agreed upon in order to implement a step-wise
delegation of responsibility to promote decentralization and local level planning (LLP).

Health sector diversification: In order to diversify service provision, MOHFW would
build capabilities to become active service purchasers in partnership with NGOs and
private providers. The pattern of service provision would be adjusted over time by the
increasing use of contracts and commissions for NGOs to provide primary and secondary
care in areas where they had a comparative advantage, and for private providers to offer
secondary and tertiary services for poor people where they could do so cost-effectively
and at high quality.

Stimulating demand for HNP services: This was to be achieved through: (i) improving
the sector’s image and greater attention to effective communication, education and
information strategies for key health problems; and (ii) expansion of demand-side
financing. MOHFW initiated a pilot with technical support provided from the World
Health Organization (WHO), of a voucher scheme to enable poor pregnant women to
purchase maternal health services initially in 21 Upazilas and which was further
expanded to 53 Upazilas during the life of HNPSP. Further piloting of other demand-side
financing schemes, such as health insurance, were planned with the aim of scaling up
following independent evaluation.

1.7 Other significant changes

The HNPSP was restructured three times, as follows:

October 2009 (Regional Vice President Level):
 One PDO indicator was revised to improve measurement, implying a less specific but
   more realistic way of measuring pro-poor resource allocation, and in line with regular
   MOHFW monitoring. Another PDO indicator was made more specific for improved
   measurement. Also, the intermediate results indicator (for Component 2) indicating
   an increase from 5% to 10% in share of govt. expenditure allocated to MOHFW was
   removed as it was outside the authority of MOHFW. Lastly, other IO indicators were
   modified to enable better measurement of the PDO (see Section 1.3).
 Reduction of the resource envelope for those program activities that were lagging in
   implementation under component 3 of the Project, mainly under the aim of
   “diversification 12 ? because of lack of progress by GOB to contract out services
   despite the presence of a large non-government and private entities in the health
   sector.
 The Closing Date was extended by one year to 2011 to ensure the full utilization of
   remaining resources.

Overall, the restructuring was timely and contributed to the success of the program.

2010 (Country Director Level):
 To accommodate changes in the grant amounts from donors (DfID, KfW and CIDA).

2011 (Country Director Level):
 To accommodate an increase in grant amount and reallocation of funds between
   categories.

Supplementing the restructuring there was an agreement at the Annual Program Review
(APR) 2009, that funding would be reallocated towards pro-poor activities (e.g. essential
drugs).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project preparation: The preparation of the HNPSP was informed by a thorough
background analysis and building on GOB’s HNP Strategic Investment Plan (SIP, 2003-
2010) and was linked to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), with PDO and
component objectives very relevant to the priorities of the country. The preparation


12
  In the PAD, diversification is described as increasing use of contracts and commissions for NGOs to
provide primary and secondary care in areas where they had a comparative advantage, and for private
providers to offer secondary and tertiary services for poor people where they could do so cost-effectively
and at high quality


                                                     6
specifically incorporated lessons learned from the previous support, the Health &
Population Sector Program (HPSP) such as (a) clearly identifying the role of DPs and the
Government with the GOB leading the program; (b) aligning technical assistance (TA)
with policy documents; (c) carefully considering the political economy of reform; and (d)
having demand-side strategies complement supply-side interventions.

The preparation involved all major stakeholders, including the 16 members of the DP
Consortium, civil society organizations (CSOs) and Bangladesh Medical Association
(BMA). The risk assessment correctly identified most of the major risks, although the
risk of “commitment for the proposed sectoral reforms? may have been rated too low.

The problem of low GOB financing of the health sector was identified in the PAD, and
the HNPSP, therefore, included a target of doubling MOHFW’s share of the GOB budget
(from 5 to 10%). This was a very ambitious target and the identified risk of “GOB
financing does not meet required spending level? was, therefore, appropriately classified
as Substantial.

Project design: The choice of the lending instrument, the Sector Investment and
Maintenance Loan (SIM), and the choice of the Sector-wide Approach (SWAp) was very
appropriate given the nature, size and scope of the support envisioned and requested by
GOB. A number of factors influenced the SWAp design that was developed, and the
decisions as to how Bank and trust fund (pooled) financing would be disbursed, i.e. on a
specific set of activities rather than supporting a time slice of the MOHFW program13.
Also, expanding the scope of the project to cover all of MOHFW budget items was not
considered feasible as it would have significantly increased the burden for the Bank in
terms of providing fiduciary oversight given the capacity constraints of MOHFW.
HNPSP, therefore, was a “hybrid between a project and a sector-wide program?14. While
this approach was justified by the specific circumstances prevailing at the time of
appraisal, the choice of a broader SWAp (i.e. financing a time slice of the MOHFW
program rather than financing a specific set of activities) may have been a more ideal
foundation for more far-reaching sector dialogue, both with respect to sector reforms,
ongoing resource allocations and priorities within the sector.

2.2 Implementation
General. HNPSP implementation really gathered momentum after the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) in early-2008, following rather slow progress in the first two years. This
was reflected in the downgrading of project ratings to Moderately Unsatisfactory in the
ISR in mid-2007 after it became clear that there were real impediments to
implementation which needed to be resolved. The delay in project start-up was due to
unresolved audit observations from the previous program (HPSP). Also, the slow

implementation progress was due to the fact that sector programs such as HNPSP rely on
adequate government leadership, which was not sufficiently strong (according to 2006
and 2007 APRs, and the Implementation, Monitoring & Evaluation Division [IMED]
Evaluation), particularly during the first two years. Further, a critical TA body e.g. the
Program Support Office (PSO) which was supposed to serve as the Program
Implementation Unit, was not in place until the MTR in 2008. Indeed, in 2007, some
DPs were contemplating whether to continue financing of the program which prompted
the GOB and the DPs to jointly agree on six critical actions to be prioritized by the
Ministry. This created new momentum, including increased government leadership,
facilitated by the active engagement of the World Bank Country Office and British High
Commission. Subsequently, implementation picked up momentum and four out of the six
actions were achieved within a period of six months. Limited progress was achieved in
the other two of the six action areas (putting Management Support Agency [MSA] in
place and setting up a procurement tracking system in the Directorate General of Family
Planning [DGFP]) as noted by the half-year stock take in November 2007. The program
was restructured following the MTR (although formally recorded only in 2009) and by
early-2008, the project rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in the ISR and
then to Satisfactory in 2011. The Quality Assurance Review (QAG) in 2008 also rated
the project as Moderately Satisfactory. At the end of project implementation in June
2011 (while the project formally closed in December 2011), most of the key targets were
achieved as described in Section 3 and in the ICR Datasheet. The GOB and DPs put in a
concerted effort to achieve the program targets despite the challenge of the program’s
size and scope.

The program was guided by a series of high quality independent Annual Program
Reviews. The APR had two parts – assessment by an independent team which submitted
a full APR report, and then based on the report, the GOB and DPs jointly agreed on
Action Plans which were recorded in the Aide Memoire. Not all the recommendations
provided by the independent team were implementable due to various constraints in the
government systems and, therefore, were not included in the Action Plan. This APR
mechanism functioned well. The IMED Evaluation15 notes that “the APRs became the
main source of dynamism in performance evaluation and establishing the future course of
action for the year?.

The following were some of the key issues which affected implementation either in a
positive or negative way as well as some elements of the program which require a brief
description to set project implementation within a broader context. While many of the
issues described below were indeed major challenges, the overall implementation of the
program turned out to be much more successful than indicated by the sum of these
challenges. This is important to note, particularly given the large size of the program and
the inherent and historically difficult environment of working in Bangladesh.

Political context. Bangladesh witnessed frequent (2006, 2008 and 2009) changes of
government during the implementation period, leading to changes in national priorities as
well as transfer of staff in key positions. One of the major effects of these changes was
that the diversification process (i.e. outsourcing NGOs and private providers, as described
in section 1.5) could not be implemented as originally planned. Consequently, when the
program was restructured, the overall budget was reduced by the unspent funds in this
area. Another example of this was that the original commitment to the PSO, MSA and
Performance Monitoring Agency (PMA) was no longer there (discussed in details in the
section on “other institutional issues?). Furthermore, the frequent shift of Line Directors
(LDs) (often only in position for less than a year), responsible for the operational plans16
(OP), also emerged as a factor causing systemic inefficiencies. The attempt in the latter
half of HNPSP to keep LDs for the major OPs in place for 2-3 years was only partly
successful, as many LDs either retired or got promoted.

Decentralization. Although a decentralization policy was approved in 2009, the health
system in Bangladesh remained very centralized. It is widely agreed (PAD, MTR, APRs)
that in order to improve service delivery at the primary level, delegation of authority over
planning and budget at the upazila level had to be increased. Consequently, in terms of
improving service delivery, the lack of progress on decentralization was problematic. In
order to circumvent the slow progress of overall decentralization reform and to move
towards functional integration of health and family welfare, an Upazila Health System
(UHS) was suggested by the APR 2009, and also endorsed in the 2009 Aide Memoire to
be piloted and subsequently implemented in the follow-on sector program.

Budgeting & planning. The division of the health sector in a health and a family
planning directorate, a division that extends from the center to the lowest institutional
level of the service delivery system, (except the Community Clinics), impeded integrated
budgeting and planning of health services at all levels. At the central level, integrated
budgeting and planning was impeded because the development and revenue budgets were
planned in different units, resulting in an “absence of synchronization between the
revenue and development budgets of MOHFW? (IMED Evaluation). In addition, the
structure of the two budgets was different: the revenue budget was allocated to
facilities/institutions, while the development budget was allocated to programs. This
problem was and remains pervasive in the GOB system and is not specific to the
MoHFW. The Program Implementation Plan (PIP) of HNPSP identified a large number
of OPs (38) for implementation of the program. The difficulties of integration between
the silo-like OPs were identified as an important problem (MTR 2008), and IMED 2012
documented the inefficiencies that this led to, one example being constructed facilities
not utilized to full capacity due to lack of coordination between the procurement of
equipments and allocation of manpower.


16
  Operational plan is defined as the primary implementation structure of the MOHFW’s Health SWAp.
There were 38 OPs distributed across the Directorate General of Health Services, Directorate General of
Family Planning and the MOHFW and other agencies. Each OP reflected a priority area of the MOHFW’s
Health SWAp and was led by a Line Director with a functional administrative structure including staff,
budget and infrastructure.


                                                   9
New institutions & TA (PSO, MSA & PMA): As part of the HNPSP, some new
institutions were planned: the PSO and the MSA were created in 2007 and 2008
respectively. However, their effectiveness could be challenged, as there was “a huge
disconnect between these agencies and the Ministry whom they were supposed to
support? (as noted in the 2009 APR). The PMA was never established, but its function
was integrated into the existing structures by hiring consultants. At the program design
stage, there was ownership of these new structures at the top level management of
MOHFW. With the change of government, the level of ownership also changed,
exemplified by MOHFW not fulfilling the legal covenant of PSO/MSA for several years.
Instead of showing flexibility, DPs insisted on having PSO/MSA/PMA despite the
MOHFW’s reluctance. MOHFW took so long (nearly two years) to evaluate the bidders’
proposals for PSO/MSA that good quality firms withdrew their proposal, and/or
shortlisted firms were no longer in a position to field the staff indicated in their proposals.
These delays also meant that firms that were awarded the contracts for PSO/MSA could
not send experts as originally proposed and, therefore, the quality of the TA suffered and
the TA institutions could not deliver as per expectations. This led the GOB to discontinue
the contracts for PSO and MSA in 2010.

NGO contracting. The diversification, particularly in terms of contracting of NGOs, did
not progress as originally planned. This was mainly due to the shift in GOB’s political
preference as the new Government did not want to contract out essential public health
service delivery, like nutrition, to the private sector. NGOs were contracted out for
nutrition, TB and HIV services as a part of the diversification agenda. However, lack of
capacity and planning at the implementer’s level were two other issues that impeded the
greater involvement of the non-government sector in the service delivery. For example,
the National Nutrition Program (NNP) under HNPSP was plagued by regular
interruptions in service delivery due to the government’s delays in contracting the NGOs
as service providers. Furthermore, the performance of some NGOs was questionable as
documented in periodic performance reviews of NNP.

Goods and Civil Works. The HNPSP financed capital investments, i.e. equipment and
civil works, as well as procurement of goods such as essential drugs and vaccines,
funding areas of major importance to the delivery of quality services. Capital investments
and procurement of commodities ended up constituting 71% of the pooled funding
expenditures (out of which 3% for civil works). These were major contributions to
improving service delivery.

Performance Based Financing (PBF). Twenty five percent of pooled funding was
allocated for PBF based on fulfillment of agreed upon specific indicators. The indicators
were agreed on with the government every year and the funds were provided when the
indicator target were achieved. This modality was initially not very successful in terms of
achieving the targets set, and in the first years the amount set aside for PBF was not
disbursed. One reason could have been that the incentives provided by the PBF may not
have been adequate, as the funds received for achieving the PBF target were not directly
allocated to the level which was responsible for achieving the target. Nevertheless, due to
the reallocation of the budget (in 2009), the GOB did not eventually lose any funding as a



                                              10
consequence of noncompliance with the targets for obtaining the PBF associated funding.
The MTR gave a quite harsh assessment of PBF, calling it “an example of old fashioned
conditionality?, and “inconsistent with Paris Declaration principles?. While there is a
certain truth to this, particularly as the first tranche was associated with establishing the
PSO and MSA, there are also clear benefits in enhancing the focus on results by financial
incentives. During the last two years, the PBF targets were met and the mechanism was
well understood and it turned out to be useful as it enabled the MOHFW to use funds on
priority activities, thereby serving as a valuable source of flexible funding. Eventually,
the PBF did deliver results, and important lessons were learned regarding this new
modality in development assistance.

HNPSP Coordination. The HNP Coordination Committee and HNP Forum led by
MOHFW, including DPs, assessed project progress and discussed implementation and
policy issues. The DPs were organized in a HNP Consortium with a Chair, who spoke on
behalf of the DPs as much as possible. MOHFW held Coordination Meetings (Secretary
and the Director Generals of DGHS and DGFP) reviewing mainly the OPs, in principle
monthly, but in practice less frequently. Monitoring was highly centralized leaving little
discretion to lower level management (e.g. Divisional and Upazila).

In addition Task Groups were established - following the recommendation of the first
APR - to assist MOHFW in monitoring implementation progress of priority areas. The
regularity and effectiveness of meetings varied; but it seems this modality was functional.
The IMED Evaluation of HNPSP concluded that “neither of the fora 17 engaged in
systematic policy review because there was little demand/need for policy discussions
from either the Ministry or the DPs?. It should be noted that broader policy dialogue may
not have been part of their terms of reference. Overall, the coordination provided good
guidance on a number of implementation issues, but less so on higher level policy issues.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The HNPSP was monitored using two sets of indicators – one for the full sector
program with 62 indicators (PAD Annex 3A, p.34-39), which was revised during the
MTR to a list of 30 indicators; and the other for the pooled fund, which was drawn from
the broader Results Framework and included 10 key project indicators. This subset of
indicators (PAD Annex 3A, p.33) was revised during the MTR and was used for
reporting in the Bank’s ISR.

The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) PDO was referred to in Annex 4 of the PAD
with a different set of 8 indicators (6 of which are of impact level indicators). Most but
not all of the DCA PDO indicators were also part of the broader sector Results
Framework (RF). An update of the status of indicators in the broader RF, including a
number of those listed in Annex 4 of the PAD, is provided in the ICR Annex 9.

As discussed earlier, one of the original PDO indicators “Proportion of total MOHFW
expenditure allocated to the 25% poorest districts? could not be monitored and, therefore
due to unavailability of data and up until the MTR the same level has been reported. This
indicator, therefore, was changed to “Percentage of MOHFW at the upazila level and
below? during the RVP level restructuring approved in October 2009. It was done in
consultation with MOHFW and DPs on the basis of available data reported in the Public
Expenditure Review (PER), conducted by the Health Economics Unit (HEU) of the
MOHFW with the support from Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).
However, the PER was not published as regularly as planned during 2009-2011, and data
relating to the revised PDO was available only up to fiscal year (FY) 2008/09 (the report
was published in 2011). Changes to other indicators have been discussed already in
Section 1.3 and 1.7 of the ICR. The ICR Datasheet reflects both original and revised
targets and includes comments for each indicator.

The HNPSP included establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) in MOHFW
and improving the overall Management Information System (MIS). Several means of
measuring output and outcome indicators (including inequality) were introduced. Most
important were the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) and the
Utilization of Essential Services Delivery (UESD) Survey. The sector program was to be
reviewed annually by an independent team of experts during APR.

Relying on periodic cross-sectional surveys like BDHS and UESD only enables to
monitor the RFW indicators with a lag of nearly two years, as the surveys use a 3 to 5
years’ recall period. For this reason, the indicator updates at the end of the program date
usually refer to a much earlier time than the completion date.

Implementation. The project indicators were regularly monitored as part of the APRs and
were reported in the aide memoires. The broader Results Framework indicators were
monitored (to the extent data were available) in the first three years. These were annexed
to the aide memoire, but following the revision of the list in 2008 during the MTR, they
were no longer part of the aide memoire, and evidence of their use for monitoring
HNPSP was not found. However, the Annual Program Implementation Report (APIR)
continued to update the revised RFW with 30 indicators.

There were a number of challenges with the use of the overall MIS for the sector,
including problems with coverage, data quality and fragmentation. Specifically, the
problems included bifurcation of routine data systems between the Directorate General of
Health Services (DGHS) and the DGFP; private sector providers, who provide a major
share of services not accounted for in the routine system; and heavy dependence on cross-
sectional surveys for regular monitoring of program activities. The Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit was established but not fully staffed and mainly run by Gesellschaft für
Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) staff and short-term consultants to deliver APIR,
and with unclear institutional home.




                                            12
Utilization. The APRs pointed to a low level of use of data for decision making on all
levels. It was pointed out during the ICR review, however, that the APRs contributed
substantially to identifying and analyzing issues and improving sector dialogue.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. MOHFW complied with the Bank's safeguards requirements and policies. A
Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) Guideline was developed, and implementation
of the HCWM plan was rolled out involving a partnership with the Ministry of Local
Government as well as private organizations. The DGHS took the lead in implementing
the HCWM plan at the health facilities.

There were no adverse impacts of the project on the indigenous people who mostly reside
in Chittagong Hill Tracts. As part of the sector program, the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) implemented a package of health services in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
Limited progress, however, was made in implementation of the Tribal Health Plan. A
Tribal Health Plan Implementation Committee and a separate Task Force for
implementation of the Plan was set-up, but neither the Committee nor the Task Force met
regularly. A mapping exercise of service availability and an ethnographic study were
initiated but not completed.

At the design stage of HNPSP, it was not envisaged that the project would finance civil
works. Following the MTR, it was agreed that the project would finance some civil works
in pro-poor areas keeping in line with the Bank’s social safeguards and environmental
policies. An environment management plan (EMP) was prepared during appraisal of
HNPSP. The Bank worked with the Government to ensure that the civil works financed
out of the pooled funds met social safeguards and environmental policies of the Bank.

The final ISR rated overall safeguard compliance as Moderately Satisfactory.

Financial Management (FM). During program implementation, MOHFW made
considerable progress in Public Financial Management (PFM). The FM Assessment of
HNPSP indicated that the PFM system in MOHFW, like all other sectors in Bangladesh,
was not streamlined enough to manage public funds effectively.

A TA support provided by DFID to the Financial Management and Audit Unit (FMAU)
focused on regular and timely preparation of Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and
did not include any component for FM systems strengthening which could have enabled
funds to be channeled through the GOB system.

The Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) was introduced in order to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure. MOHFW and the DPs reached an
agreement on single sector accounts and reporting (FMRs), auditing, M&E systems under
the Program. The quarterly FMRs were mostly submitted on time. MOHFW is the first
Ministry in Bangladesh that outsourced its internal audit function to ensure effective
periodic monitoring of financial and operational activities in the sector. Between fiscal



                                           13
years (FY) 2006 and 2011, the World Bank identified 36 audit observations (worth USD
68.14 million) as material and substantive from the observations raised by the Foreign
Aided Projects Audit Directorate (FAPAD) auditors. Although MOHFW has resolved all
of them, the pace of resolving these issues was slow.

MOHFW organized regular Financial Management Task Group (FMTG) meetings that
gave an overview of progress on sectoral financial management, including performance
of preparation of FMRs, implementation of APR action plans, resolution of both internal
and external audit observations, capacity development and training of staff.

There were weaknesses during project implementation relating to the weak internal
control environment and high staff turnover. While, these challenges did not adversely
affect project implementation as necessary mitigation measures to improve the internal
control environment were planned at project preparation and some additional measures
were put in place during implementation which, however, did not aim at long term
capacity building. The mitigation measures included TA for preparing FMRs;
outsourcing internal audits; training of staff; developing action plan as well as arranging
tri-partite meetings to follow-up on audit observations.

The final ISR rating for FM was Moderately Satisfactory.

Procurement. Performance of three procuring entities Central Medical Stores Depot
(CMSD), DGFP, and Health Engineering Department (HED) was satisfactory even
though there were some delays in completing the procurement cycles. The other two
entities (NNP and National AIDS/STD Program (NASP) struggled with preparing quality
procurement documents and hence needed a lot of support. Modest progress was noted
in strengthening procurement capacity. On the positive side, computerized procurement
tracking systems were put in place in one procuring entity (under DGFP), and
procurement desk officers were provided with training throughout the project period.
However, challenges remained and these included high staff turn-over, lack of capacity in
dealing with complaints, and delays in conducting procurement audits.

Often, the Bank was accused of having very cumbersome and slow procedures. However,
the reasons for delays had a lot to do with issues of low quality documents prepared by
the procuring entities and weak capacity. Although some capacity building did take place,
no comprehensive support to improve MOHFW capacity in this area nor in the FM area
was included in HNPSP which is regrettable. Nevertheless, in spite of these limitations
and capacity constraints, MOHFW was able to ensure supplies of commodities as evident
from the fact that there were no stock outs of family planning commodities in the last two
years of HNPSP, for example. The final ISR rating for Procurement was Moderately
Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

With the one year extension of HNPSP (to end in 2011) and the reallocation of budget
included in the restructurings, a smooth transition to the next phase (Health Sector



                                            14
Development Program – HSDP – approved by the Bank in May 2011) of support was
ensured. The HSDP comprises: Improving Health Programs (Component 1A) including
essential services (nutrition and NCDs); Improving Service Provision (Component 1B)
including the Upazila Health System, hospital management and urban health; and
Strengthening Health Systems (Component 2) including governance, planning &
management, human resources (HR), financing, Health Information System (HIS),
quality assurance (QA), drug administration & regulation, procurement and supply chain,
and construction & maintenance. Given this scope and focus of HSDP, no significant
transition issues are envisaged.

In terms of performance indicators to monitor the longer term impact, most if not all of
the 12 project indicators are regularly monitored in Bangladesh. In addition, the HSDP
contains a broader Results Framework that will also ensure continued monitoring of
relevant key sector indicators. The exception may be in the area of NCDs where
indicators for follow up are not described.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: The PDO as well as the underlying three component objectives
(Intermediate Results) were highly relevant in terms of health outcomes and systemic
issues identified at appraisal. The objectives and project design were also highly relevant
vis-à-vis the GOB’s strategies and the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
The objectives were very broad, which is expected given the size and scope of HNPSP.
The relevance of objectives is rated as High.

Relevance of Design: The design, in terms of a sector approach with GOB implementing
the HNPSP and TA largely integrated within MOHFW (e.g. no separate project
implementation unit), components, sub-components and implementation arrangements
were consistent with the stated objectives at outset. However, key actors in GOB outside
the MOHFW did not seem to be fully on board with a major assumption underpinning the
HNPSP, namely a doubling of the share of GOB budget going to MOHFW, and as a
consequence this specific indicator and target was eventually dropped, following the
MTR.

There were a number of constraints and relevant concerns that made a more limited
SWAp design (i.e. financing a specific set of activities rather than a time slice of the
MOHFW program) an appropriate solution. These are described in more detail under
Section 2.1.

The clear focus on service delivery was important and very appropriate. The underlying
systemic problems in the sector particularly relating to HR and decentralization issues
continued to impede the efficient delivery of services over the life of the project. While it
should be noted that many issues like HR, governance, public finance, decentralization,
urban health, etc. are beyond the health sector and can only be addressed by government




                                             15
wide reforms, thereby falling outside the control of HNPSP, there is a question as to how
much this constraint should have been better anticipated in the project design stage.

The establishment of contracted out TA agencies/units, i.e., PSO, MSA and PMA,
created problems as described in section 2.2 and was abandoned during the later part of
HNPSP.

The use of a MDTF combined with IDA to form pooled fund for the sector was a very
efficient and practical way of aligning different DP funding for implementing the GOB’s
health SWAp.

In sum, the project design is deemed to be appropriate in the complex context of
Bangladesh, and hence the rating of design is Substantial.

Relevance of implementation: Implementation arrangements comprised several fora to
discuss issues, both between GOB and DPs as well as between DPs supported by an
efficient independent review mechanism. Changing circumstances were well reflected
both in a revised focus from year to year as well as in the restructurings. Also, the
changes made following the MTR reflected the revised priorities and ensured better
ability to track and evaluate the program. Other adjustments in budgets and allocations
were also very appropriate and timely. The relevance of implementation is rated
Substantial.

Overall rating of relevance is Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

During the implementation of HNPSP, Bangladesh made impressive progress on most of
the health outcomes and the country is now on track to achieve MDGs 4 and 5. The
maternal mortality ratio (MMR) declined by 40% from 322 in 2001 to 194 maternal
deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010 and under five child mortality rates (U5MR)
declined by 26% from 88 per 1,000 live births in 2004 to 65 in 2010. Total fertility rate
(TFR) declined from 3.0 in 2004 to 2.5 children per woman in 2010 and the contraceptive
prevalence rate (CPR) for modern methods increased by 10% over 2004 and 2010 (from
47% to 54%).

Out of the three PDO indicators of the project RFW, one indicator “% of MOHFW
expenditure at the Upazila level and below? showed a positive trend although data is
available only up to FY 2008/09. The overall achievement of PDO and IO indicators is
satisfactory as reflected in the ICR Datasheet, particularly considering that some data for
results are referring to a point in time before the completion of HNPSP, and that many (7
of 12) indicators have exceeded the target (up to 131% achievement).

The main thrust of the PDO statement centered on availability, utilization and
accessibility of quality HNP services. Achievements relating to the availability and
utilization of services can be drawn from progress in the following indicators:



                                              16
    TB Case Detection Rate (97% of the target achieved)
    % children (under 1yr) fully immunized (84% achieved)
    % Children 1–5 receiving Vitamin A supplements in last 6 months (113% achieved)

Achievements relating to the accessibility of services can be drawn from progress in the
following indicators:
 % of women targeted by voucher scheme delivered by skilled birth attendants (SBAs)
    (at facility or home) (107% achieved)
 MOHFW expenditure on medical and surgical requisites at districts and below (fully
    achieved)
 Utilization rate of ESD of the two lowest income quintiles in terms of
         a) delivery attended by skilled personnel (130% achieved)
         b) ANC coverage by medically trained provider (fully achieved)

The following table summarizes the achievements towards PDO and IO targets before
and after restructuring of HNPSP. Actual achievements in the overall program’s results
framework are provided in Annex 9.

It is important to note that the pooled funds contributed to a slice of the sector program
and, therefore, the success of the project relied on a number of factors, both within and
outside the pooled fund, including funding from other sources (e.g. GOB revenue and DP
earmarked funding). The specific causality in terms of achievement of targets is,
therefore, difficult to measure, due to the nature of such broad-based support. It must be
noted, however, that given the very large amount of the MOHFW’s revenue funding
allocated to salaries, with little flexibility in the short term, the contribution of the pooled
funding appears much more substantial in terms of the proportion of key inputs it
financed, e.g. drugs, and new initiatives. Therefore, it is fair to assume that the HNPSP
has contributed significantly to the very positive achievements in the sector. Furthermore,
it is more relevant to consider the HNPSP as a partnership between the GOB and the DPs
with HNPSP co-financing the Bangladesh HNP sector and to assess whether this
partnership achieved what it had set out to do in the sector as a whole. In other words,
rather than looking at the possible specific impact (attribution) of the pool funds (IDA
plus MDTF), consistent with the agreements made under International Health
Partnership 22 and the Paris Declaration 23 the issue is whether HNPSP supported an
overall successful program. On the basis of program achievements with respect to key
health sector indicators, as outlined above, it is clear that HNPSP was part of a largely
successful GOB effort albeit more could have been done in some key areas as discussed
earlier in the implementation section of the ICR.

In sum, on balance, the achievement of the Development Objectives is rated Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
Revisiting the assumptions for the PAD’s cost efficiency analysis indicates that Net
Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) presumably are quite good,
probably even better than expected (see Annex 3).

The primary health care interventions that have been the emphasis of the HNPSP are
generally considered very cost-effective, e.g. immunization, antenatal care, SBAs,
vitamin A supplementation, nutrition services, contraception and treatment of childhood
infections. The HNPSP’s poverty focus (see 3.5a) has also directed funding towards those
in most needs and with the highest disease burden.

One source of inefficiency was that there were 38 OPs, resulting in limited coordination,
overlaps and lack of synergy between the activities of the MoHFW, as has been well
documented by the IMED Evaluation as well as the Public Expenditure & Institutional
Review.

One issue pertaining to efficiency is the overall funding of the public sector. A public
sector funding level of US$ 4-5/capita/year (even with the addition of private and out-of-
pocket spending to total health expenditure of US$ 16/capita/year), is generally
considered grossly inadequate to deliver comprehensive basic services. Given the results

of the sector in terms of more vertical approaches, it seems that performance can be
increased even with such a low level of funding. Achieving what is generally accepted as
very good results in key areas such as maternal and child mortality with limited funding
can be considered effective24. But the problem remains that it is likely that efficiency of
other more complex services, to which HNPSP can be assumed to contribute as well, is
quite low given the severe under-financing of the sector.

Achievement of efficiency is rated Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Combining the ratings for project relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(the combined rating is Substantial), the rating for achievement of Development
Objectives (Satisfactory), and the rating for Efficiency (Substantial), the Overall
Outcome Rating is: Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
HNPSP investments have been pro-poor as evident by the fact that the poor actually
increased their share of service utilization during HNPSP period (e.g. utilization of ANC
and SBAs increased for the lowest two quintiles). In addition, HNPSP focused on the
rural areas, nutrition services were expanded to poor Upazilas, and areas selected for civil
works were based on poverty and health indicators.

With a strong focus on maternal and child health (MCH) services, the female population
has benefitted (e.g. the MMR was reduced), contributing to better gender balance in
health service delivery.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Facilities to deliver basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care (EmOC) services
including maternal and child welfare centers (MCWCs), were established under HNPSP.
Besides, some of the health facilities at the Upazila level that cater to the needs of poor
people were upgraded from 31 to 50 bed with the associated equipment, drugs and health
personnel. Progress is also noted in areas, such as the establishment of an M&E unit,
modest improvements in procurement and FM capacities, expanding hospital autonomy,
improved budget management, some improvements in HR management (was included in
PBF) but not substantial, and improved disaster preparedness. The HNPSP was more
focused on service delivery.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None documented.

   As also pointed out by the 2010 Bangladesh Public Expenditure & Institutional Review (Vol. II): “While
expenditures on health are low, high value is obtained from those expenditures compared to other countries
in the region?

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No beneficiary survey was done as part of the ICR. However, the IMED evaluation
contained a survey of service recipients, which among other findings showed that
majority of the beneficiaries were satisfied with the health services provided at the
government health facilities and around 80% of the beneficiaries reported that the
government health services have improved during HNPSP compared to pre-HNPSP
period. Focus group discussions at Upazila level were also conducted revealing a quite
positive impression of HNPSP.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The lack of management and stewardship capacity constitutes a risk to further
development of the sector, but the risk may be less in terms of maintaining the current
level of achievement. This risk is further mitigated by the follow-on operation, HSDP,
which comprises a health systems strengthening component.

The general under-financing of the sector constitutes a barrier to progress much beyond
what has already been achieved. However, given Bangladesh’s sustained good
performance in some areas, particularly in relation to vertical and less complex
interventions, sustaining the current level of achievement is assessed to be fairly likely.

Risk to Development Outcome is rated Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The Bank team did a thorough job during project preparation, as evidenced, for example,
by the Concept Note Review, the Quality Enhancement Review (QER) Report and the
PAD. Many relevant issues were raised that seem to have improved the quality of the
project design and the final documentation. Lessons from implementing the previous
SWAp (HPSP, 1998 to 2003) were incorporated while designing HNPSP and risks at
appraisal were adequately assessed. The Bank, jointly with the Government, led the task
of bringing together the DPs and harmonizing and aligning their support as much as
possible in line with the Government’s program and priorities, thereby providing
substantial flexible financing for the GOB’s HNP SIP. The design of the project was
rather complex with three components and five disbursement categories. The PDO that
was chosen for the pooled fund was the same as the overall objective of the SIP, even
while the description of the PDO in the PAD and the legal agreement were different. This,
however, did not lead to a substantive difference in terms of evaluation because they both
broadly reflected the goals of the SIP. However, it must be noted that the two PDO
Indicators that were chosen focused too narrowly on the equity (or poverty-related)
aspects of the PDO, which was only one of several dimensions of HNP services
incorporated in the PDO. The two PDO Indicators also proved to be difficult to measure
in practice, which is why these were changed during the 2009 restructuring. The Results



                                            20
Framework is presented in two parts in the PAD, one for the pooled fund and the other
for the full sector program; but no explicit descriptions are provided which is likely to be
a source of confusion for those not involved with the program. The PAD also contains
some inconsistencies in terms of the DP financing figures presented in the datasheet and
the annex. On balance, while major effort was made by the Bank team, more could have
been done to improve the project indicators and documentation, as well as measures to
address fiduciary capacity issues. This was also a finding by the Quality at Entry Review
which was carried out by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) which gave an
overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory for project preparation.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision
General supervision of HNPSP was comprehensive and thorough, and addressed the
relevant issues including development impact, as well as fiduciary and safeguards aspects.
Particularly, the independent APRs contributed very constructively to identifying major
problems and suggesting appropriate solutions. As indicated earlier, program
implementation and, therefore, disbursements were slow in the first two years. In 2007,
six critical actions were prioritized by the Ministry, facilitated by the Bank team and the
British High Commission. Implementation picked up within a period of six months. At
the mid-term in 2008/2009, the Bank team proactively restructured the project and
program implementation gained further momentum. The quality of supervision remained
satisfactory in the last three years of the program. In retrospect, the Bank team could
have downgraded the ratings of the project slightly earlier than in 2007, after two years of
implementation. Instead, the Bank team worked hard to address the issues hoping that
there would be improvements earlier on. Once it became clear that more substantial
changes were needed, the Bank team was proactive in pursuing restructuring.

Bank Task Team Leaders (TTLs) turn-over was high, with four TTLs during the
implementation of HNPSP. Given the Bank’s role as managing not only the IDA
contribution but also the MDTF in a very large operation, it would have been better to
have the TTL resident in Bangladesh (which was the case with a number of the TTLs) to
be able to stay involved in implementation monitoring on a daily basis. However, it
should be noted that locally based Bank staff were very closely involved in project
monitoring and had very collaborative relationship with the implementing agency and the
DPs, and in the final year of the program implementation a national staff served as a TTL
of HNPSP. The Bank team regularly provided updates to the pool funders on various
aspects of the project including financials and implementation progress. The Bank
managed a heavy workload relating to reviewing annually 38 OPs, procurement and
financial management documents/reports, ensuring due diligence as well as providing
procurement training to the Government counterparts.             Generally, the Bank’s
administration of the MDTF was of good quality and the required fiduciary oversight was
provided by the Bank team. The Bank team also provided implementation support to the
Government on a daily basis. Regular visits were undertaken at field facilities and
program areas to oversee NGO-implemented activities (particularly nutrition and HIV)
and civil works sites (for ensuring social safeguards and environmental guidelines). The



                                            21
Bank team also played a critical role in updating and revising the results framework as
well as agreeing on and monitoring the Performance Based Financing (PBF) indicators.

Considering the successful management of the complex and crucial pooled funding
arrangement, the rating for supervision is Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Government ownership and commitment should be ensured given that the HNPSP
supported the GOB HNP sector SIP. During implementation, there was considerable
progress in the service delivery aspects but limited progress in some of the reform areas
particularly in advancing HNP sector modernization.

The political economy played a major role in setting priorities and strategies. Democratic
elections resulted in changes in government which naturally also resulted in changes to
some policy priorities. This should, however, not be seen as lack of commitment.
Considering that health sector remained a priority area for the Government and there has
been sustained commitment in the sector, the rating is: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
MOHFW was implementing its SIP for HNPSP under severe constraints in terms of
capacity, the systems in place, and within a very constrained overall financing envelope
(US$ 4 per capita, around 6% of total GOB budget). In addition, the influence of many
different political and other interest-groups created a very complex environment for
implementing the HNPSP. These issues were known and the difficulties in successfully
implementing all planned initiatives should be seen against this background. As
previously noted, MOHFW leadership was not very strong in the first two years of
program implementation but improved significantly in the later part (see also Annex 6:
IMED Evaluation). All legal covenants were eventually complied with and substantial
progress in program implementation was achieved despite the above mentioned
constraints. Overall, MOHFW achieved very good results, as described in previous
sections, overcoming difficulties, many of which were beyond its control. Consequently,
the rating is: Satisfactory

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Combining the rates for government and implementing agency performance, and
considering that HNPSP’s focus was more on improving service delivery (MOHFW
responsibility) than advancing sector reform (to a large extend GOB responsibility) gives
a rating of: Satisfactory




                                           22
6. Lessons Learned

   Sector-wide programs like HNPSP, which includes funding from various sources
    necessitates an effective dialogue between government and DPs on the sectoral plan,
    budgets and priorities as these DP support complement the GOB financing. Given the
    circumstances during the design phase of HNPSP, a SWAp was the most feasible
    approach for aligning with GOB systems and having a single set of sector priorities.
    However, with the view to the next project it is essential to build in measures to
    overcome the issues that had prevented a more full-fledged SWAp whereby all of the
    parallel projects would have been under the SWAp umbrella. Under the new sector
    program, HSDP, the parallel projects have been reflected in OPs (which was not the
    case under HNPSP).

   Ensuring commitment and maintaining policy dialogue with key ministries beyond
    the health ministry, e.g. Ministry of Finance (MOF) and ministries responsible for
    decentralization and civil service reform is very important for achieving
    improvements in health. It necessitates a very good partnership and a sensitive
    approach to fully understand the complexities of government commitment, including
    ensuring the commitment and incentives for the lower levels of government.

   Understanding the political economy, not least for complex countries like Bangladesh,
    is important. More flexibility from DPs to adapt to changing national priorities will
    help resolve any disagreements that may arise while implementing the project.

   Performance based funding is challenging, both in terms of identifying appropriate
    indicators and targets, and also in terms of understanding whether the incentives it
    provides can be expected to yield the desired results. The overall incentive structure
    of the system, and not least the specific incentives of the unit responsible for
    achieving the target, need to be thoroughly analyzed.

   Establishing new entities within a government system, with rules and regulations
    different from those of government, is very difficult. Such initiatives should not only
    be discussed and agreed upon at the highest level of the Government but also with the
    actual implementers to ensure buy-in from all levels of the Government and that
    proposed reforms are feasible.

   For large sector programs like HNPSP, which rely on Government’s FM system,
    specific systems strengthening component would have mitigated some of the issues
    emanating from weak fiduciary capacity.

   The results framework should include indicators that are directly linked to the project,
    are within the purview of the implementing agency and are measurable. If there are
    multiple sets of indicators, as in the case of HNPSP, it should be clearly stated in the
    PAD which set is used for monitoring what.




                                            23
   In order to ensure proper M&E of the sector-wide programs like HNPSP,
    restructuring of RFW indicators should be made as early as possible (if required) with
    the aim to monitor a final set of indicators on regular basis during the program
    duration.

   For critical RFW indicators, relying on other DP-driven projects/initiatives to collect
    data is not advisable.

   For large SWAps, and particularly in circumstances such as in Bangladesh, it would
    be advisable that Task Team Managers are locally based in order to provide
    maximum support to Government and to ensure coordination with other partners.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

    1. The draft ICR of HNPSP has well identified the successes and weaknesses of the
       HNPSP. MOHFW is in agreement with the ICR rating as “Satisfactory?, and this is
       in line with the End-line evaluation of HNPSP by IMED, Ministry of Planning.
    2. For seven out of the twelve indicators, achievement was more than 100%, which
       contributed to increase in availability and utilization of essential healthcare
       services.
    3. HNPSP implementation has brought in some efficiency gains, which have been
       identified well in the ICR. These include on-time submission of FMRs,
       outsourcing of internal audit functions (as the first Ministry in GOB), and pro-poor
       investments. The MOHFW is aware of the weaknesses of HNPSP as identified in
       the ICR, viz. weaknesses in fiduciary management capacity, under-spending of
       allocated finds, etc., and the new health sector program has been designed to
       address these issues.
    4. Regarding ICR’s observations on delay in contracting a) PSO/MSA and b) NGOs
       for nutrition services, there were valid reasons for the delay in contracting
       PSO/MSA and questionable performance of a number of NGOs resulted in delay
       in contracting NGOs to provide nutrition services.

(b) Cofinanciers

Comments made by KfW:
The report gives an interesting overview on the program implementation. We share the
same points of view in many respects. The report describes the project implementation
from the WB perspective. However, the donor arrangements and the cooperation between
all development partners (pooling and non-pooling funders) could have been analysed
more in detail. It seems that the revision of PDO indicators and outcome indicators in
2009 translates the lowering of the expectations concerning the program results. If this
had not been done, the assessment would have been not so good. Further details provided
in Annex 7.




                                            24
Comments made by DfID:
The report provides a relatively balanced narration of the implementation environment,
strengths and constraints of the last SWAp. However, preparation of this report nearly a
year after the completion of HNPSP may limit its usefulness. Progress on indicators were
generated by the Government information systems. The lack of third party verification or
triangulation of data and results continues to be a concern deepened by the recognition of
overall ‘weak internal controls…’ and limited progress in M&E in the sector. The report
states that Bangladesh is on track to achieve MDGs 4 & 5 according to the BDHS and
BMMS results, but it remains unclear how much is attributable to the public sector
through the SWAP. This is in part because of the considerable private sector health
provision in Bangladesh, some of this by public providers themselves, goes largely
unmentioned.Further details provided in Annex 7.

Comments made by Sida:
Although there have been significant achievements in the health sector but the experience
of HNPSP shows that weakness remain. It is clear that coordination between DPs and the
Government, as well as among the DPs must be revitalized in order to increase alignment
and harmonization. Systemic problems include overly centralized health system, weak
governance structure and regulatory framework, inefficient allocation of public resources,
lack of regulation of the private sector, and a shortage of human resources for health.
Progress in the health sector reform is very low and need to be fully owned by GOB and
supported by adequate technical assistance. Further details provided in Annex 7.

Comments made by Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands:
The ICR is fine and informative.

Annex 2. Outputs by Components

1. Accelerating   Bangladesh has seen an accelerated reduction in infant and child
achievement of    mortality rates (MDG4) as well as impressive decline in MMR
HNP-related MDG   (MDG5) about 40% in 10 years. Accelerated progress is being
and PRSP goals    achieved with regards to MDGs 4, 5 and 6, owing to successful
                  public health interventions. However there has been limited
                  progress in MDG 1. This requires essential service delivery
                  targeted to the poor, particularly women in the areas of
                  reproductive health, ante and post natal care, delivery by SBAs,
                  nutrition counseling and micronutrient supplementation. Fertility
                  decline in Bangladesh has resumed after a decade-long plateau
                  and has reached 2.3. There has also been substantial progress in
                  increasing contraceptive prevalence which has increased from
                  47.3 percent in 2004 to 54.1 percent in 2010 for modern methods.

                  Between 2004 and 2010, impressive gains have been made in the
                  coverage of vertical programs: 82 percentage of children under 2
                  receive all basic vaccinations in 2010 up from 73.1 percent in
                  2004; 82.6 percentage of children 9-59 months given vitamin A
                  supplements in 2010; and, 82.7 percentage of children under 5
                  with symptoms of acute respiratory infection sought care from a
                  trained provider in 2010, up from 74.6 percentage in 2004. The
                  progress in vitamin A supplementation and full immunization
                  coverage have been equitable with less than 10% difference
                  between the poorest and the richest wealth quintiles.

                  The challenge is to increase utilization of essential health service
                  deliveries attended by skilled personnel. In 2010 it was 26
                  percentage compared to 15.7 in 2004; percentage of antenatal
                  coverage by medically trained provider was 56 percentage in 2010
                  compared to 50.5 percentage in 2004.

                  A number of public health interventions have shown good
                  progress, achieving or exceeding their targets. TB control, one of
                  the most successful public health partnership programs, has
                  already achieved 2010 targets of a 70% detection rate and an 85%
                  cure rate, the latter due to the 100% coverage of Directly
                  Observed Treatment-Short-course (DOTS) at the District level.
                  The National Malaria Control Program also achieved the 50%
                  reduction of malaria specific mortality target in 2008.

                  MOHFW has finalized a National Health Policy that sets out the
                  priorities of the Government and aligns it with the goals set out in
                  the Second National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction
                  (NSAPR II).

2. Meeting          Over the last several years, Bangladesh has been witnessing
emerging HNP        several natural calamities, new and emerging diseases and an
sector challenges   increasing incidence of NCDs. Among the many aspects covered
                    under this component, avian influenza and emergency
                    preparedness are areas that have clearly progressed well. The
                    country seems well prepared for emergencies relating to natural
                    disasters. There are standard operating procedures in place for
                    mass casualty management and disaster mitigation for field level
                    health personnel. The program has well-functioning teams to
                    respond during emergencies. Although these systems are in place,
                    the quality of any response may be hampered by the often fairly
                    low level of institutional capacity and service quality in the health
                    sector.

                    For prevention and control of major NCDs, some limited progress
                    has been made. Under reduction of injuries and implementing
                    improvements in emergency services, four one-stop crisis centers
                    to address violence against women, were established during the
                    project period in four divisional Medical College Hospitals.
                    Further, the manual that guides management of violence was
                    updated in 2007 and training initiated for health service personnel.
                    There are, however, limitations regarding appropriately trained
                    personnel which constrain the availability of some services.

                    Limited progress has been made in the area of urban health
                    services development. The Ministry of Local Government, Rural
                    Development and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC) has contracted out
                    NGOs to implement services in the urban areas while MOHFW
                    provides the required commodities such as contraceptives and TB
                    drugs. Besides, MOLGRDC in coordination with the MOHFW is
                    in the final stage of development of a strategy for Urban Health
                    Services.

                    MOHFW has made important strides in developing policies and
                    strategies for emerging challenges. These include development
                    and endorsement of: The National Health Policy; b) Strategic Plan
                    for Surveillance and Prevention of NCDs 2011-2016; and c)
                    National Cancer Control Strategy and Plan of Action 2009-2015.
3. Advancing        The demand-side financing (DSF) pilot, a maternal health voucher
HNP sector          scheme for pregnant women, in 33 upazilas under this component
modernization       has been successful in increasing skilled delivery and substantially
                    increasing safe motherhood practices in the pilot areas. Major
                    policy decisions/agreements on decentralization and hospital
                    autonomy were not reached due to the changing political situation.
                    Building on the concept of LLP, district-specific work plan were
                    prepared and implemented by making resources available to



                                         28
increase permanent and long-term contraceptive use in lagging
divisions of Chittagong and Sylhet.

There has been limited progress in implementation of this
component. This may be due in part to the setting of over
ambitious expectations that did not sufficiently take into account
political economy considerations.

Health sector diversification aimed at harnessing national
capacity for provision of HNP services by setting up mechanisms
for greater involvement of non-public providers. Progress in this
component was aimed to the expansion of the NNP area based
community nutrition program to 63 new upazilas and transfer of
management of HIV/AIDS NGO contracting from UNICEF to
the Management Support Agency(MSA).

Some additional achievements:
 A regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals was established
 MOHFW have also initiated a process to develop National
   Health Care Financing Strategy.
 The proportion of districts with Disease Surveillance Reports
   increased substantially.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Annex 3A: General sector considerations

Total health expenditure (THE): According to the third round of the Bangladesh
National Health Accounts 1997-2007 (BNHA 1997-2007) per capita THE was US$ 16 in
2007 (Purchasing Power Parity US$ 46). The public sector accounted for one fourth of
the per capita health spending that remained under 1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
throughout the period.

The total health expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP was 3% in 2003 which rose
to 3.4 percent in 200726, showing a slow but steady increase over time (Figure A3.1). Per
capita health expenditure increased at a higher rate than per capita GDP. Rising THE is
explained by rise in households out-of pocket payment at the time of service delivery.

Government health expenditure: The HNPSP RFW set a target to increase MOHFW
budget to 10% of total national/government budget by 2010. During the implementation
of the Project, the share of health budget has remained under 7% (Table A3.1) except in
2007/08. In case of revised MOHFW budget the share crossed 7% only in 2006-07.

However, a closer examination of the MOHFW budget and expenditure reveals that it is
not lack of commitment or under financing rather under spending is an issue which
leads to fluctuation in allocation to MOHFW (PER 2007/08 and 2008/09, HEU,

government wide problem (PER 2006/07, HEU, MOHFW, 2010, page 3).

Composition of expenditure: The composition of expenditure is analyzed in terms of
two broad categories: i) capital versus recurrent expenditures; and ii) salary versus non-
salary recurrent expenditure.

Capital expenditure remained around 20% during the project period but reached the peak
in 2005/06 (Table A3.2) As shown in the table, the share of MOHFW spending for
capital expenditure has been fluctuating.

It is to be noted that major share of total MOHFW spending is meant for salaries.
Therefore, it is important to examine how HNPSP money was spent. The following table
shows that 68% of HNPSP pooled fund was spent on goods and equipment which
includes contraceptives, drugs and medicines and medical equipment.

Absorptive capacity. There is a chronic under spending of MOHFW development
budget. During 2003/04-2005/06 (covered by the Contingency Plan between HPSP and
HNPSP) unspent portion of the development budget halved from 28% to 14% (Table
A3.5). However, since 2005/06 it has been fluctuating. The Program aimed to resolve the
constraints that led to under-spending of the allocated budget. Several steps were taken to
expedite fund release.

Annex 3B: HNPSP

HNPSP Expenditure by quarter
During the first two years of HNPSP, expenditure was low due to slow implementation of
program activities as discussed earlier while towards the end expenditure increased with
accelerated implementation of the program. Table (A3.6) shows disbursement pattern
throughout the program period by quarter. In almost every year, expenditure increased in
the last quarter while in the first two quarters, expenditures tended to be low. This may be
due to the fact that there were delays in release of funds to the cost centers.

Economic rationale at Appraisal

A formal cost-benefit analysis was included in the PAD. Such analysis is known to be
difficult and is prone to methodological problems including uncertain assumptions.
Another way at looking at this issue is more qualitative as described below.

During the preparation of HNPSP, it was suggested that the program will allocate
increased resources to the poorest Upazilas. During implementation, this indicator was
revised to increase resource allocation to all Upazilas as there were difficulties in
measuring this indicator. The program also focused on reaching the poor and underserved
and investing in known cost effective interventions (e.g. immunization, behavior change
communication on nutrition and NCDs).

The HNPSP also set out to address governance issues that could have reduced wastage
and improved efficiency. Many of these identified at Appraisal had to do with financial
management, yet increasing GOB capacity in FM system strengthening was not included
in the HNPSP.

Furthermore, with a very high level of out of pocket (OOP) expenditure combined with
the market failures in the health sector, improving government stewardship of the sector,




                                            33
as intended, was economically sound. The planned pilots on Demand Side Financing had
the potential of increasing utilization of cost-effective services, which was delivered on.

Implementation implication for efficiency

Most of the economic rationale was maintained throughout HNPSP. And overall the
HNPSP fared well in terms of achieving its goals, including increasing service uptake by
the poor, and sustaining a high proportion of funding spent at the Upazila level (>50%). It
also maintained a focus on poverty and equity, for example when it was decided to fund
civil works these were prioritized towards poor/underserved areas.

Other areas related to efficiency were less successful: diversification was achieved to a
minimal degree. Capacities in financial management and procurement were weak and
during the program implementation capacities were built on procurement and preparation
of timely FMRs. The structure of the HNPSP with its many silo like OPs where
investments often were not sufficiently coordinated caused a number of inefficiencies (as
e.g. documented by the IMED Evaluation).

Financial analysis

The overall HNPSP (pooled funding, i.e. IDA and MDTF) performed well with a much
larger disbursement from the MDTF than originally envisaged, see disbursement profile
below.

Sustainability

Funding in the sector was US$ 4-5/capita/year to deliver comprehensive basic services.
Given the results of the sector in terms of more vertical approaches, the performance
could have been improved more with higher levels of funding. Given that the pooled fund
financed a fairly big share of MOHFW revised development budget (56%), sustainability
in the short term would have suffered, if a similar program had not followed HNPSP. In
the longer term GOB should easily be able to sustain a very basic primary health care
focused health system, given the economic growth of 6% and the fact that with the low
proportion of GOB funding going to the health sector, GOB could increase the proportion
it allocates for health if this was considered a political priority.

Cost-Benefit Analysis

The PAD calculated an NPV of US$ 610 million (5 year) and US$ 2,975 million (10
year) and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 21% and 51% for 5 and 10 year horizons.
These calculations are based on the assumptions listed in the table below.

been a very worthwhile investment.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

No beneficiary survey was done as part of the ICR. However, the IMED evaluation
(IMED evaluation, pp. 139-145) contained a survey of service recipients at the facility
level and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) at upazila level, a summary of which is
provided below.

Main findings from the interviews with service recipients:

A total of 490 exit clients and beneficiaries of the catchment areas of District Hospitals,
Maternal and Child Welfare Centers (MCWC), Upazila Health Complexes (UHC) and
Union Health & Family Welfare Centers (UH&FWC) were randomly selected for
interview in order to assess the utilization of health and family planning services
provided by the respective health facilities. Among the patients interviewed, 87%
indicated that they have visited the health centers in the last six months, and the main
services sought in the health facilities were treatment for common disease, various
illnesses affecting children, emergency health care, complications during delivery and
side effects of family planning methods. 89% of the patients reported that they were
provided service by MBBS doctors at the facility and the rest by para-professionals or
Family Welfare Visitors (FWV).

The mean waiting time of the patients was 31 minutes and 49% of the patient reported
that privacy was maintained during examination. 90% of the patients reported the service
providers’ behavior as satisfactory/fairly satisfactory, while 3% reported service
providers’ behavior as very unsatisfactory. Majority of the patients suggested that in
order to improve the health services in the public facilities, it is important to ensure
supply of essential medicine, regular availability of the physicians at the facilities,
placement of MBBS doctors, and availability of equipments. Around 80% of the patients
indicated that the services provided from the government health facilities has improved
over time.

Main findings from focus group discussions (FGD) at upazila level:
Seven FGD meetings were conducted at the upazila level. The groups comprised of male
and female patients in selected health facility, Chairperson as well as members of the
Upazila Parishad (i.e. local government body), private physicians, teachers, community
youth leaders, and farmers. All the groups opined that HNPSP was implemented well,
which resulted in marked improvement in a) quality of health services through UHC, b)
availability of doctors, nurses and equipments, and c) supply of essential drugs to the
patients especially to the women, children and the poor.

The groups also identified that there should be more attempts to take the health services
to the door-steps of the poor people and the health workers should be equipped with all
required facilities. Adequate supervision should also be ensured.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

As outlined in the Executive Summary & Chapter 5: “Strengths and Weaknesses of
HNPSP? from IMED Evaluation.

Summary of IMED Evaluation:

1. The Report presents the End-line Evaluation of HNPSP as per the terms of reference
   (TOR) prepared by the Evaluation Sector of IMED. HNPSP is the second sector-wide
   program of the MOHFW and continued from 2003 to 2011. The implementation of
   the Program involved three separate governments: (1) from 2003 to end-2006, (2)
   from 2007 to end-2008, and (3) from 2009 to June 2011. Implementation picked up
   from 2007 after the APR diagnosed HNPSP as a patient needing intensive care under
   the threat of becoming terminally sick. This prompted even the-then Chief Adviser's
   Office (of the care-taker government) to establish monthly monitoring of the Program.
   The MTR of HNPSP was done in 2008 followed by revision of the PIP and that of all
   the 38 OPs for the remaining period. In view of the expenditure patterns, it was
   decided to extend the HNPSP for an additional year i.e. upto June 2011, (sec. 1.1).

2. In line with its terms of reference, the End-line Evaluation attempts to assess how far
   HNPSP has been able to achieve its declared goals and targets, to identify its
   strength and weaknesses and to offer recommendations for 'more pragmatic and
   effective implementation of the Program' (sec 1.4).

3. Both quantitative and qualitative data have been used in preparing the Report. Annual
   Performance Review (APR) reports and a considerable number of periodic national
   surveys and occasional reports provided the secondary material which has been
   supplemented by the findings of a quantitative survey, focus group discussions (FGD)
   and intensive qualitative interviews with the stakeholders. The findings of the field
   survey and interviews are placed at Part III of the Report (sec. 1.5). These are in
   broad agreement with, and supportive of, the findings of the national level surveys
   and affirm quite high level of user's satisfaction with HNPSP services.

4. Part II of the Report contains studies on a number of OPs prepared by 4 Consultants
   covering some of the major OPs dealing with (a) services delivery and with (b) the
   services delivery support systems. The service delivery OPs include 3 from DGFP:
   Clinical Contraception Service Delivery Program, Family Planning Field Services
   Delivery Program and the OP on Maternal, Child and Reproductive Health Services
   Delivery Program. 2 OPs from DGHS have been covered: OPs on Essential Services
   Delivery and Improved Hospital Services Management. In addition 1 OP on Nutrition
   has been included, so that 6 OPs related to service delivery have been covered.

   The following OPs on Service Delivery Support System have been covered by the
   Consultants: 3 OPs on human resource management along with the investments on
   capacity development, spread over a large number of OPs and 3 OPs on PFM and 2



                                           40
   on Procurement (Chapter 9). These Reports are also accompanied by an Executive
   Summary.

5. The Report presents an assessment of the major impact indicators (Ch.4 and Annex-
   D) which shows considerable improvements in health outcomes both for the
   achievement of MDG and PRS goals: reduction of maternal and child mortality,
   reduction of malnutrition and total fertility rate (TFR), improvements in: CPR, Vit-A
   supplementation, women receiving ANC & PNC, delivery at health facility,
   assistance by medically trained provider during delivery and the nutritional status of
   women and children etc. TB case detection and cure rate was higher than targeted,
   while HIV/AIDS had remained low in coverage. The poor performed better thereby
   reducing the gap with those in the highest quintile, though the remaining gap is still
   very substantial.

6. It is however not possible to apportion these improvements to health sector
   interventions or specifically to HNPSP alone. A number of socio-economic factors
   seem to have influenced the outcome (sec 1.3). Moreover, the HNPSP represented
   only a part of the resources being invested in the health sector: it did not include the
   non-public sector; neither did it include all the resources of the MOHFW. In fact, it
   did not even include all the development budget interventions of the Ministry: e.g. 11
   development projects in Annual Development Program (ADP) (2010-2011) including
   the project on Revitalization of the Community Clinics were outside its purview. In
   view of its limited boundary, it will be unrealistic to assign the national health
   outcomes to effects of HNPSP. However there is an international recognition that
   Bangladesh must have been doing something right to achieve the improvements in
   health status.

7. The Report has specifically focused on the structure of implementation and co-
   ordination in HNPSP (sec. 3.1), with coverage of its monitoring mechanism (sec. 3.2).
   The planning, processing and approval of OP, the role of the LD and the various
   monitoring mechanisms like APR, APIR, Stakeholders Consultation, the monthly co-
   ordination meetings etc. have been highlighted with notes on lessons learnt and
   suggestions (section 3.2.4).

8. Strength and weaknesses of HNPSP-both structural and operational-have been
   identified (Ch. 5) with recommendations linked to the weaknesses (Chapter 6). The
   four Reports on the OPs at Part II also include analysis of weakness and strength with
   recommendations for those OPs.

Strengths and Weaknesses of HNPSP (As in IMED Evaluation)

HNPSP is the second program of MOHFW using a SWAp, as mentioned in section 1.1 of
the introductory chapter of this Report. Some of its strengths and weaknesses can be
traced to its inheritance. These appear to fall into 2 broad categories: structural and
operational. Below are some of them, which are not exhaustive but may be representative.




                                            41
1. Strength of HNPSP:
      a) Structural- In spite of reservations about certain operational aspects of the
      Program, the planners and policy formulators of MOHFW recognize the usefulness
      of the SWAp, however limited and constrained it is in coverage of health services
      delivery in the sector. They emphasize on the fact that the SWAp allowed them to
      concentrate on specified objectives, develop programs to match those objectives, fix
      targets for achieving improvements and marshal needed financial resources to
      support the various activities for achieving the targets. Moreover, this helped
      MOHFW to be in the driving seat while allowing the DPs a broader role in the total
      process of planning and implementation of the Program. The SWAp had bestowed
      upon MOHFW the responsibility of taking a holistic view of the health sector and
      had raised expectations about the Ministry's stewardship role for both the public and
      non-public sectors through setting service standards, accreditation and quality
      control etc. This had led to increased awareness and ownership of the Program by
      MOHFW.

     b) Operational-
       1. At the operational level, HNPSP provided flexibility to adjust to new
       challenges, e.g. the Avian flu or the health risks posed by cyclone Aila etc. and to
       develop fully funded program activities to meet those emergencies. Moreover,
       Inter-OP fund adjustments could be made based on annual review / assessments to
       improve utilization, even though it was felt that there was scope for improving
       upon the flexibility in HNPSP operation.

       2. HNPSP practiced a 'soft' SWAp which allowed it to mix sector and project
       resources to overcome or side-step constraints of accessing 'pooled' funds as
       needed. This was used as an option by MOHFW to avoid or to reduce shortfall in
       procurement planning, or to address needs which the established processes were
       failing to respond to, or to pilot new interventions / approaches.

       3. Major health indicators like maternal mortality, child and infant mortality,
       population growth rate, CPR (Table 4.1), immunization rate, TB case detection
       and cure rate or even the sero-surveillance rate for HIV/AIDS etc. showed
       remarkable performance during the program period. See Annex- D for the
       achievement of benchmark indicators. Impressive improvements in health
       outcomes have been consistently reported by variety of surveys, reports and
       studies. It is however common knowledge that a host of conducive socio-
       economic factors influenced the positive health outcomes (see section 1.3) and it
       would be difficult to apportion the responsibility to only the health interventions.
       Yet there is an increasing awareness in international circles that Bangladesh and
       MOHFW must have been doing something right to take forward and sustain the
       positive trends. There is no better evidence than these to affirm the success of the
       policy and programs being followed by MOHFW.

       4. During the long HNPSP period, the performance of service delivery- both
       MNCH and public health- improved, after initial slow take-off. Utilization of



                                            42
       facilities at District and levels below increased without increase in financial
       investment, indicating achievement of efficiency gains. Access of the poor to
       utilization of public services also improved steadily, even though it remained
       considerably lower than that of the highest quintile.

       5. Fiduciary risk management consistently improved over time within the
       constraints of MOHFW's financial management structure.

2. Weakness and Constraints of HNPSP

Some of the constraints and weaknesses of HNPSP followed from its structure-the way
in which the Program was designed or its activities were structured, while quite a
substantial number of the weaknesses appear to be of operational nature- the way in
which the program and the activities were implemented.

2.1 Structural weakness and constraints

1.   The Program design of HNPSP was both complex and rigid. The 4 major
     components described at section 2.2 indicate the vastness of its scope and ambition.
     The beginning of a policy shift from MOHFW being a 'provider' of health services
     to a 'purchaser' was skillfully built into the Program, with provision of institutional
     support in the form of 3 private sector agencies assisting MOHFW to take the
     necessary steps. The burden of these 'reforms' weighed heavily on the scarce
     managerial resources of MOHFW, made more challenging by the political
     transitions which took place in end-2006 and again in early 2009. The MTR in 2008
     recognized this design-aspect as a major draw-back of HNPSP and suggested re-
     designing the Program with emphasis on the service delivery system and a
     strengthened support system (to include HR, procurement, M&E and financial
     management etc.) The suggestion was not acted upon and the constraints posed by
     the mentioned aspects of the Program's design remained to the end.

2.   Procurement and funds release posed serious points of contention and
     misunderstanding between MOHFW implementers and the fund manager, the
     World Bank, throughout the HNPSP period. The dissatisfaction often reached the
     planners and policy formulators in MOHFW and this became quite voluble when
     the new government took charge in 2009. Delays in procurement processing and in
     logistic supply as well as the fund's release conditionalities (involving 3 categories
     of payments, the annual conditionalities around release of performance based
     financing and the quarterly fund release system through reconciled FMRs etc.)
     adversely affected the progress of implementation of the Program. Limited steps
     could be taken by MOHFW and the World Bank to reduce the difficulties but both
     were hobbled by their built-in institutional inadequacies.

     The procedural rigidities connected with delays in procurement and funds release
     could be traced mainly to the type of loan which Bangladesh (ERD) negotiated with
     the World Bank- an investment loan which reflected perception of higher level of



                                            43
     fiduciary risk, as opposed to say, policy lending. PFM system of Bangladesh is the
     responsibility of the MOF and the issues connected with perception of fiduciary
     risks are beyond the scope of MOHFW. The fact, however, remains that HNPSP
     was implemented within the rigidities imposed by the investment loan and suffered
     procedural delays and considerable management challenges in smooth
     implementation of the Program.

3.   The structural divide between the Revenue and Development aspects of budget in
     the governmental financial system had serious implications for planning and
     implementation of HNPSP. For example, shortage of needed (health) human
     resource due to difficulties in creation of posts or in filling up vacancies- both of
     which are functions of Revenue budget created shortfall in service delivery as a
     constant feature of HNPSP. Systems were not set up to trigger the creation of posts
     or the filling of vacancies in the revenue set-up of the Ministry to tie-up with the
     creation or upgrading of additional physical facilities (for hospital or medical
     training etc.) through HNPSP OPs. This explains existence of newly built physical
     facilities failing to provide the planned services due to acute shortage of needed
     manpower e.g. doctors, nurses or technicians with specific skills. Development
     expenditure through OPs was thus robbed of creating improved service impact due
     to absence of synchronization between the Revenue and Development budgets of
     MOHFW.

4.   Additional structural rigidity was introduced by the way in which each of the 38 OP
     was designed as separate units independent of each other. This led to misuse and
     misallocation of resources as has been pointed out in sub-sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.
     Thus, for example, investments through OP on physical facilities were made
     without providing those with supply of equipments through OP on Improved
     Hospital Management Services. This was made worse by the absence of
     coordinated steps for supply of needed human resource on the Revenue side. MTR
     2008 and APR 2009 drew attention to the constraints created by the structure of
     stand-alone OPs and their 'tunnel' visions.

5.   The uncompromising bifurcation of services between the two Directorates-of
     Health and Family Planning-from the centre to the lowest service delivery points at
     the field level - led to duplication and avoidable wastage of financial and human
     resources. Both the MTR 2008 and APR 2009 commented on the negative effects
     of the bifurcated services and urged upon improved co-ordination in the absence of
     any realistic possibility of providing integrated services. Unfortunately, those who
     were MOHFW policy formulators during the planning of HNPSP supported and
     contributed to the bifurcation of the services. It is a negative legacy with which
     subsequent health programs will also have to grapple with.

2.2 Operational Weakness and Constraints

The operational weakness and constraints could be traced mainly to the ways in which
OPs were planned, processed and implemented, the management’s performance: in



                                           44
procurement, placement and retention of HR, supervision and monitoring of
implementation, MOHFW's stewardship role, quality of service, and governance etc.

   1) OPs - planning, processing and implementation:
      a. OP Planning: OPs were the main instruments for the content and
         implementation of HNPSP. Unfortunately, these were centrally planned,
         without any input from or interaction with the field-level implementers. The
         top-down planning was accompanied by top-down implementation, without
         being responsive to the needs or suggestions originating from the actual
         implementers of the programme-activities. There was no scope for learning
         from experience. This approach, for example, used a traditional facility-based
         resource allocation formula which failed to take into account the specific area-
         based needs or the needs of poverty stricken areas. Studies were made with
         suggestion to develop more rational resource allocation formula, e.g. based on
         population and poverty, but these remained as academic exercise only. Similar
         was the fate of studies undertaken with HNPSP funds for the
         operationalisation of district plans or LLP, which failed even to generate a
         small-scale pilot.

      b. OP Processing: The OPs were hastily prepared, processed and approved
         (Sections 3.1.1-3.1.3), each OP as self-sufficient stand-alone unit unconnected
         with each other. The ill-effects of such an approach have been pointed out in
         Section 3.1 and commented upon especially in MTR 2008 and APR 2009.

   2) LD - most important manager:
      The LD was a key manager of HNPSP. He also provided the basic input for
      planning and revising the OP. However, he didn’t have the training, exposure or
      institutional support needed to effectively play his role as planner or manager of
      implementation. Not even the dozen LDs, each of whom handled over 50 crore
      taka worth of programmes under their OPs, had any specialised support for fund
      management, disbursement, accounting or reporting. They were not given even a
      preliminary orientation to the scope or contents of HNPSP or what constituted a
      SWAp. To complicate matters, there were quick turn-over of LDs often: there
      were stark examples of 5 LDs within a year for an OP! The choice of a LD was
      not based on merit but on seniority, where only an officer of the level of a
      Director in the Directorates was given the responsibility. As a result, quite often,
      officers became LDs at the fag end of their career when learning new things or
      being enterprising or imaginative would be very exceptional. The quality of
      leadership from the most important manager of implementation of HNPSP, i.e.
      LD, suffered due to deficiency in management support system as well as due to
      poorly prepared individual leadership. The same holds true of the LDs in the
      Ministry as well.

   3) Management Performance:




                                           45
The management's performance in procurement, placement and retention of HR,
monitoring and supervision of implementation in the field, ensuring quality of
service and good governance etc. left scope for considerable improvement.

a. Procurement: Deficiency in procurement planning, processing and tracking
   was reasons for complaints and frustrations of most LDs and implementers,
   especially against centralised procurement. More unfortunate and counter-
   productive was the fact that there were many instances where procured
   equipments or drugs were allocated to places or institutions which had no use
   for them either because they did not need those or because the required
   technical staff/resources for their operation were not made available. A survey
   of procured equipments by the World Bank found considerable wastage of
   HNPSP resources due to uncoordinated central procurement. (Bangladesh
   Equipment Survey, 2008, WB)

b. Placement and Retention of HR: Given the fact that there is overall shortage
   of health service providers in the public sector- doctors, nurses and
   technicians, there is a pressing need to make judicious and equitable use of
   this critical input for ensuring promised service delivery. In spite of the
   widespread recognition of this need, the MOHFW management failed to
   evolve a system for national placement and retention of service providers. The
   rural and hard-to-reach areas continued to remain at the receiving end, while
   the absence of appropriate skill-mix deprived the people of services for which
   investments had been made e.g. emergency obstetric care services. MOHFW
   made attempts from time to time to address the problem, but these were
   neither consistent nor driven by legal or ideological compulsion.

c. Monitoring and Supervision of Implementation: Like planning, monitoring of
   implementation in HNPSP was concentrated at the Centre, with little
   opportunity or responsibility to the other tiers of MOHFW structure like the
   Division, District or Upazila managers. MIS data originating from the ward
   level (by the Health Assistant/ Family Welfare Assistant) travelled upward all
   the way to the Directorate HQ (of DGHS and DGFP) where these got
   aggregated, but the field implementers had little scope to utilise them in
   programme monitoring. Neither were these used at the monthly co-ordination
   and review meetings held at the level of Secretary MOHFW or of the DGs at
   the 2 Directorates. At the field level, there were no systemic requirements for
   regular and periodic supervision. As a result, no Supervision Manual or
   guideline was developed. Monitoring was restricted to one-way reporting
   from the field to higher levels, with little systematic feedback from those
   levels or from the LD or the DGs. The Ministry's M&E Cell had little role to
   play in analysing the MIS data, the field reports or the monthly IMED reports
   sent by the Planning Wing of MOHFW. Neither did IMED prepare or discuss
   Monitoring Report on HNPSP with MOHFW. Monitoring and Supervision
   remained a neglected activity in HNPSP.




                                    46
   d. Quality of Service and Good Governance: Quality of service and good
      governance suffered partly due to absence of an established regime of field-
      level monitoring and supervision. It was also partly a result of absence of
      quality-culture. The OP on quality assurance did develop Quality Manuals in
      the form of Standard Operating Procedures for different health facilities and
      conducted training workshops to orient and train the service providers at some
      districts and upazilas. However, these were not implemented and put into
      practice. While the top managers did not possibly feel it important and urgent
      enough for introduction, there was no community pressure or demand from
      the public representatives associated with the Management Committees of
      those facilities. The community's voice had little institutional role in HNPSP
      for improving service quality or poor governance e.g. absenteeism, informed
      payments, non-receipt of available service or mistreatment, etc.

4) MOHFW's stewardship role:
   MOHFW is not merely the public service provider but also the regulator for all
   service providers: public, private, NGOs etc. The private sector's role has been
   gradually expanding in providing medical education (for doctors, nurses,
   technicians, etc.), hospital and clinical services and in drug production etc. So has
   been the NGO's role in piloting new technology, new medicine, new service
   delivery methods and targeting the disadvantaged people or hard-to-reach areas
   etc. The quick expansion of the non-public sector has raised issues about
   standards and quality and the need for the Government to ensure that the public
   receives an assured and dependable service. MOHFW exercises its role as
   regulator through enactment of laws and through institutions specifically created
   to administer those laws e.g. BMDC, BNC and SMF for registration of doctors,
   nurses and paramedics respectively. The expanding non-public sector is making
   demands on the capacity and resources of the regulators, for which they are not
   adequately equipped and resourced. Accreditation and standard-setting are crucial
   for ensuring quality for the private and the public sector as well. MOHFW had
   failed to take major steps during HNPSP period to convince that it took its
   stewardship role of the health sector as seriously as needed.

5) Response to New Challenges:
   Increasing and rapid urbanisation together with improving income are posing
   serious health challenges in the form of the NCDs like hypertension, diabetes, etc.
   while drawing attention to inadequate public service provisions for the expanding
   number of urban dwellers. HNPSP identified both as important areas of concern
   but failed to take adequate steps to address these. The OP on NCD was inadequate
   in leadership, programmes and implementation while MOHFW failed to take
   meaningful steps to establish an urban health strategy or engage the Ministry of
   Local Government for joint initiatives in addressing the challenges of urban
   health.

6) Absence of Strong Leadership of HNPSP:




                                        47
The SWAp expects strong leadership from the Government while the DPs provide
support- both financial and technical for the successful implementation of the
sector programme. The Annual Programme Reviews lamented the absence of
ownership of HNPSP by the senior leaders of MOHFW particularly during the
APRs of 2006 and 2007. Things improved since then but no follow-up action was
taken by MOHFW on recommendations by the APRs for branding HNPSP or
developing a communication strategy for its recognition by the service providers
and recipients. Instead of the MOHFW leadership, the APRs became the main
source of dynamism in performance evaluation and establishing the future course
of action for the year. Similarly, the Task Groups for different functions (see sub-
section 3.2.3.3) failed to yield optimum service in the absence of adequately
prepared government leadership.
MOHFW felt diffident in taking up and resolving problems HNPSP was facing
regarding release of funds, procurement processing, sudden personnel changes,
uncertain reporting by parallel funders and similar other issues involving other
Ministries of the Government (like M/O Finance, M/O Establishment, etc.) and
those involving the World Bank or the DPs. The need of SWAP for different
dispensation separate from a project was not systematically made at inter-
ministerial levels by MOHFW.

Annex 7. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

KfW (reproduced verbatim):
General remarks:
    The draft report gives an interesting overview on the program implementation.
        We share the same points of view in many respects. However, we have a few
        remarks on the draft.
    The report concludes that most implementation activities focused on the delivery
        of medical services and that there were not many activities in favour of health
        systems reform or for health policy development. Apparently, there was a lack of
        real policy dialogue among others also between donor and MoHFW. In the
        “lessons learnt? the importance of political dialogue and system reforms are again
        emphasized. However, in the document we miss an analysis on the hindering
        factors and how they could be overcome.
    There are a number of institutional reform areas in the health sector in Bangladesh.
        Health services could gain a lot of efficiency if the institutional problems would
        be overcome. In the draft report, you find some indications of some of them but
        the report does not go very far when discussing those very critical issues of
        institutional modernization.
    The draft report describes the project implementation from the WB perspective.
        However, the donor arrangements and the cooperation between all development
        partners (pooling and non-pooling funders) could have been analysed more in
        detail.
    It seems that the revision of PDO indicators and outcome indicators in 2009
        translates the lowering of the expectations concerning the program results. If one
        had not done this, the assessment would have been not so good.
    On page 9 of the draft, the revenue and development budgets are described.
        However, the risks involved with that budget presentation is not clearly spelt out
        including the untimely release of the revenue budget information. We consider the
        timely presentation also of the revenue budget as an essential element of
        transparency. If we want to assess the performance of MoHFW, we need to know
        whether they have been able to mobilize their own resources in time. If those
        budgets are structured in, different ways both are spent by the MoHFW.
    As for the procurement issue (page 14), a few problems are pointed out
        concerning the tender documents. We also want to know whether the procurement
        entities have prepared needs assessments and whether those needs assessment
        were checked.
Specific remarks:
    The list of abbreviations is incomplete. I could not find the following
        abbreviations: CSO, DO, MSA, MS, and SIM.
    On page 8 they talk about six critical actions taken by the GOB and DPs. Those
        actions are not disclosed in that text section. I suggest indicating them.

                                           49
DfID (reproduced verbatim):
    The report provides a relatively balanced narration of the implementation
       environment, strengths and constraints of the last SWAp. However as an internal
       World Bank assessment of progress and received nearly a year after the
       completion of the last sector programme in June 2011, this may have limited
       practical usefulness.
    What is striking in the report is that significant statistical progress seems to have
       taken place in all of the key indicators during the last sector programme yet the
       data comes largely from Government’s own systems. For example, progress on
       indicators like “percentage of Districts with disease surveillance systems?, “TB
       cure rates? are generated by the Government information systems while public
       expenditure reviews are done by the Health Economics Unit of the MoHFW itself.
       The lack of third party verification or triangulation of data and results
       continues to be a concern deepened by the recognition of overall ‘weak internal
       controls…’ and limited progress in M&E in the sector.
    A second concern is that 71% of pooled funds were expended on capital
       investment, yet there is no system for performance or operational audits (only
       financial audits are conducted).
    Although there were (and continue to be) Annual Performance Reviews that
       include independent reviewers, the report states: “not all recommendations
       provided by the independent team (APR) were implemented due to various
       constraints in the Government system….?. However the constraints were not
       explained.
    Finally, the report states that Bangladesh is on track to achieve MDGs 4 & 5
       according to the BDHS and BMMS results, but it remains unclear how much is
       attributable to the public sector through the SWAP. This is in part because of the
       considerable private sector health provision in Bangladesh, some of this by public
       providers themselves, goes largely unmentioned.

Sida (reproduced verbatim):
    Although there have been significant achievements in the health sector but the
       experience of the second health sector programme, HNPSP, shows that
       weaknesses remain.
    The result framework shows many of the targets are not achieved or achieved
       partially despite of changing initially set targets. Disparities between poor and
       not-so-poor have increased at the sub-regional level, and inequity in access to
       quality social services remains a challenge.
    Gradual decline of health budget is another area of concern. MOHFW’s total
       budget is a proxy for the total HNPSP budget and it reflects government’s priority
       and political will. This budget is increasing in nominal terms, more than 10
       percent per year since 2008/2009. But inflation is 10.5 percent that indicates real
       increases are less impressive.
    Systemic problems include overly centralized health system, weak governance
       structure and regulatory framework, inefficient allocation of public resources,
       lack of regulation of the private sector, and a shortage of human resources for
       health. Progress in the health sector reform is very low and need to be fully owned


                                           50
    by GOB and supported by adequate technical assistance. Policy dialogue needs to
    be more inclusive.
   The funding modality of HNPSP took a cautious approach to fiduciary risks. It is
    in principle similar to the financing mechanisms used in very difficult
    environments and provides a relatively high degree of assurance that donor funds
    will be properly and effectively used. However, the modality risks achieving less
    significant improvements in Bangladesh’s PFM systems, imposing higher
    transaction costs on GoB and reducing sustainability compared with a more
    aligned support. Sweden and like-minded donors will encourage GoB system
    improvement during the programme and if possible greater alignment.
   The experience of the previous sector programme makes it clear that donor
    government coordination and coordination among donors must be revitalized, in
    particular to increase alignment and harmonization. A significant share of support
    to the health sector is provided through parallel mechanisms, not necessarily
    consistent with the sector programme, on budget, or even on plan. Sida considers
    this an area of improvement. Global health and GAVI funds were outside the
    sector policy dialogue, although they are on budget. Civil society is not truly
    involved in sector coordination mechanisms.
