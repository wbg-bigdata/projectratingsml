2.      The Project is progressing well towards achieving its Project Development
Objectives. The Project is now in its final phase of implementation. Some of the
highlights of results are as follows: with regards to coverage, the trend of 6 year olds in
1st grade living in rural areas and who did not attend preschool continues to decline,
reaching a low of 5,292 children in 2011. This compares very favorably to figures for
2009 (8,154) and to the baseline of 2004 (15,861), and even surpasses the end of Project
goal of 7,921 children. Second, the transition rate from 6th grade to 7th grade continues to
increase to 89.60 percent in 2011 (from 88.5 percent in 2009), as does the transition rate
from 7th grade to 8th grade, from 77.8 percent (2004) to 85 percent (2011). In terms of
efficiency, promotion rates have also improved to 90.3 percent in 2011 (from a baseline
in 2004 of 85.3 percent).

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance: i) increased unit costs in
infrastructure activities; ii) unanticipated consultant services related to the production of
pedagogical materials; and iii) increased operating costs linked to the teacher training
program (now reaching 8,000 teachers in 20 provinces), and the financial transfers to
schools (“Planes de Mejora?) implemented in 2,033 schools. This reallocation is based
on final estimates for expenditures for the Project.
