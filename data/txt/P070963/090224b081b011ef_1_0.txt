                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With about 9 months left to closing, the Project is now in its final phase of implementation. This ISR presents updated data from the 2011 school year (unless otherwise noted), the
                         most recent year for which data is available. Some of the highlights of results are as follows: with regards to coverage, the trend of 6 year olds in 1st grade living in rural areas and
                         who did not attend preschool continues to decline, reaching a low of 5,292 children in 2011. This compares very favorably to figures for 2009 (8,154) and since the baseline of 2004

                         promotion rates have also improved to 90.3 percent in 2011 (from a baseline in 2004 of 85.3).
