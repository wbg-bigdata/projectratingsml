                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      The major changes to the Project and rationale are the following:

     a) Proceeds have been reallocated largely because of (i) the need to support carrying
        out student learning assessment on an enhanced sample of rural schools and the
        provision of feedback to the schools and operating costs (Part B of the Project),
        and (ii) the need to fund additional consultants supporting the provincial and
        national governments to implement the Project because it is being extended.
     b) The Results Framework - including indicators, baseline, and targets - has been
        extensively revised to be consistent with the legal changes that have taken place
        since Board approval of the Project and with updated available statistics, to
        increase clarity and reduce repetition.
     c) The closing date has been extended from October 31, 2011 until December 31,
        2013 to allow the Government sufficient time to finalize all Project activities.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Project was approved by the Board on December 15, 2005 and became
effective on December 14, 2006. It has two components: Component A Improving
quality and coverage of rural education, which has three sub-components: (A1)
Improving operating conditions of rural schools, (A2) Expanding coverage and
improving student promotion flow, and (A3) Strengthening line departments at the
provincial levels; and Component B Enhancing stewardship capacity of national
government, which has two sub-components: (B1) Strengthening line departments at the
national level and (B2) Monitoring and evaluation.

3.       Under Component A, about 16,822 rural schools have been organized into
clusters to help them cope with geographic isolation (usually ten rural schools that are
close to each other are grouped to jointly conduct teacher, student, and community
activities; the clusters are designed as a mechanism to deal with a common set of
problems such as education planning, training and resource management). The clustered
schools have been provided with didactic materials and teaching equipment, including
distance education learning materials. Approximately 443 infrastructure sub-projects are
currently pending approval or are under implementation. Schools in 7 provinces have
received AR$2,000 each to implement about 185 approved local educational
development projects (these are educational projects developed by students and teachers,
proposed by the schools, and selected on a competitive basis by the provinces). A total of
AR$10.3 million was allocated to 10,300 rural clustered schools in 2009 for school
maintenance (AR$1,000/school), and another AR$38.1 million to 14,049 rural clustered
schools in 2010 (AR$2,000/school). A third allocation of AR$2,000/school is being
implemented in 2011 to all rural clustered schools supported by the Project. The teacher
training activities financed by the Project, to ensure that teachers in rural areas have a
domain of appropriate multi-grade teaching techniques, are progressing well, albeit at a
different pace in different provinces.

4.      Under Component B, the Project has financed the strengthening of the monitoring
and evaluation capacity of the Ministry of Educations at the national and provincial level.
The National Ministry of Education (NME) has recently completed a standardized
learning assessment in the 3rd and 6th grades in a sample of urban and rural schools,
partially funded by loan proceeds.

5.      The implementation of the Project is carried out through existing management
structures, at both the national and provincial level. The physical and financial
implementation of the Project has been slow because of the varying capacity of execution
at the provincial level. The provinces have their own fiduciary processes, which are
different for each of Argentina’s twenty-three provinces, to the procedures agreed in the
Legal Agreement. This requires close collaboration, on both technical and fiduciary
aspects, between the NME and the provinces, and training to provincial teams associated
with the Project on fiduciary procedures. The Project has solved most if not all the
pressure points affecting Project execution. The nation has reached agreement with the
provinces to speed up Project implementation and the Project is progressing towards
achieving its Project Development Objective (PDO).

6.      In December 2006, a National Education Law (Law No 22,026) that changed the
operating environment in the education sector was approved by Congress. The law
increased the length of compulsory education from 9 to 13 years, and restored the system
of primary followed by secondary education. Under the law, provinces can restructure
their education system from a mandatory basic education (grade 1-9) to a system of
kindergarten plus 6 or 7 years of primary followed by 6 or 5 years of secondary
education. The law calls on the Ministry to enact agreements with the provinces to: i)
establish education goals, ii) agree on the level of resources needed to reach those goals,
and iii) agree on the evaluation mechanisms to assess the proper use of resources. It also
introduces complementary policies such as flexible hours and tutoring.

C.   PROPOSED CHANGES

Project Development Objectives Outcome Indicators

7.      Of the eight Project Development Objectives Indicators included on pages 6 and 7
of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), five have been revised and three have been
dropped. Two new PDO indicators have been introduced. Largely to increase clarity and
reduce repetition, revisions have also been made to the 12 original intermediate results
indicators included on page 33 of the PAD (middle column). In this restructuring they
are dropped and replaced by five new intermediate results indicators being monitored
through the end of the Project. The baseline and targets for the PDO outcome indicators
and intermediate results indicators have been revised following updated data available
from the Ministry of Education. (See Annex 1: Results Framework and Monitoring).
8.     PDO Indicators. The PDO indicators have been revised as follows:

     A. Coverage

Indicator One (indicator revised; baseline and target revised). The indicator
measuring coverage of preschool has been revised to align the indicator to the way in
which the Ministry has been estimating and monitoring the data. The baseline has been
corrected based on an adjusted series provided by the National Unit for Information and
Measuring Education Quality (DINIECE). The target has been accordingly revised.

       •   Original Indicator from PAD: “Reduce by half the difference in the access
           of 6 year old children in 1st grade as compared to 5 year old children in Pre-
           School in rural areas in Argentina?.

       -   Baseline in PAD:          9,000 students in 2004.
       -   Target in PAD:            4,500 students at Project end.

       •   Revised Indicator: “Reduce by half the number of 6 year old children in 1st
           grade who did not attend Preschool, in rural areas in Argentina.?

       -   Baseline corrected:       15,861 in 2004.
       -   Target revised:           7,921 students at Project end.

Indicator Two (indicator unchanged; baseline revised, and target unchanged). The
indicator measures the transition from primary to secondary education in Argentina. The
baseline was corrected based on an adjusted series provided by DINIECE. The target
remains as planned.

       •   Original Indicator from PAD: “Increase the access of students completing
           the 7th grade to the 8th grade of schooling, in rural areas in Argentina?.

       -   Baseline in PAD:          73 percent in 2004.
       -   Baseline corrected:       77.8 percent in 2004.

Indicator Three (new). This indicator will monitor primary school completion. Some
provinces have 7 years of primary education and 5 years of secondary education; while
others follow 6 years of primary education and 6 years of secondary education.

       •   New Indicator: “Increase the access of students completing the 6th grade to
           the 7th grade of schooling in rural areas in Argentina.?

       -   Baseline:                 91.6 percent in 2004.
       -   Target:                   93 percent at Project end.
   B. Efficiency

Indicator Four (indicator revised; baseline and target revised). The indicator
measuring promotion from the first cycle of primary education (grades 1 to 3) to the
second cycle of primary (grades 4 to 6) is replaced by the promotion rate from grades 1 to
6. This change is made to better reflect the Project objective of increasing education
achievement in both primary education and secondary education. The baseline is based
on an adjusted series provided by DINIECE. Target is revised accordingly.

       •   Original Indicator from PAD: “Improve promotion rate in EGB1 (grades 1
           to 3) in rural areas in Argentina from 76 percent to 85 percent?.

       •   Revised Indicator: “Improve average promotion rates in grades 1 to 6 in rural
           areas in Argentina?.

       -   Baseline:                 85.3 percent in 2004.
       -   Target:                   91 percent at Project end.

Former Indicator B2 (dropped). The indicator measuring the over-age enrollment in
grades 4 to 6 in rural areas has been dropped. The new education law 22,026 and other
complementary policies such as extra tutoring and flexible school hours were also
intended to bring children that had previously dropped out back to school. In practice,
this may have led to stability in the overage student population even when Project
activities were designed to decrease it. To help address the inefficiencies caused by over-
age students, and consistent with Project objectives, the Government recently introduced
a national policy aimed at reducing, over time, over-age students.

   C. Quality

Former Indicator C1 (dropped). The indicator measuring student learning gains in
grade 3 as measured by the National Student Assessment is dropped. Due to data
processing lags and delays in implementation of activities, there would only be one data
point (2010) taken, rendering comparability of performance over time in schools difficult.

Former Indicator C2 (dropped). For the same reason as above the indicator measuring
student learning gains in grade 6, as measured by the National Student Assessment, is
dropped.

Indicator Five (new). This indicator will monitor the improvement in quality of
instruction through a measure of the number of schools with teachers that have completed
additional intensive training.

       •   New Indicator: “Number of rural schools with at least one teacher graduate
           from the diploma program in math and Spanish.?

       -   Baseline:                 0.
       -   Target:                   3000.
   D. Governance

Indicator Six (indicator unchanged; baseline and target set). The PAD indicator
remains unchanged. However, it requires setting a baseline and a target which were not
indicated in the PAD.

       •   Original Indicator from PAD: “Number of bilateral agreements between
           national and provincial Governments in satisfactory execution.?

       -   Baseline:                 0.
       -   Target:                   23.

Indicator Seven (unchanged; baseline and target set). The PAD indicator remains
unchanged. However, it requires setting a target which was not indicated in the PAD.

       •   Original Indicator from PAD: “Annual plans regarding the compilation,
           analysis, dissemination and use of educational statistics in satisfactory
           execution.?

       -   Baseline:                No system in place.
       -   Target:                  System in operation and updated based on current
                                  available information.

9.     Intermediate Results Indicators. The intermediate results indicators have been
revised as follows:

   A. Component A: Improving Quality and Coverage of Rural Education

The following intermediate result indicators have been added:

Intermediate Result Indicator One (new): “Percentage of secondary rural schools that
receive ICT equipment as a share of total secondary rural schools participating in school
clusters.?

       -   Baseline:                 0 percent.
       -   Target:                   100 percent.

Intermediate Result Indicator Two (new): “Percentage of rural schools that receive
Institutional Libraries as a share of rural schools participating in school clusters.?

       -   Baseline:                 0 percent.
       -   Target:                   100 percent.

Intermediate Result Indicator Three (new): “Number of infrastructure projects
completed with PROMER funding?.
       -   Baseline:                 0 civil works.
       -   Target:                   At least 700 civil works.

These replace the intermediate results indicators below that have been dropped:

Former Indicator 1 (dropped). The indicator has been dropped as it is repetitive with
PDO outcome indicator One.

Former Indicator 2 (dropped). The indicator has been dropped as it is repetitive with
indicators Two and Three.

Former Indicator 3 (dropped). The indicator measuring improvement of internal
enrollment flux between grades 1 to 3 (former first cycle of primary) and within grades 4
to 6 (second cycle of primary) since these cycles have been replaced and are no longer
being monitored.

Former Indicator 4 (dropped). The intermediate result indicator related to overage is
deleted, for the same reasons justifying elimination of former PDO indicator B2.

Former Indicator 5 (dropped). The indicator measuring the improvement in student
achievement is dropped as it is not expected that the Project will have any short/medium
term impact on student learning.


   B. Component B: Enhancing Stewardship Capacity of national Government

The following intermediate result indicators have been added:

Indicator Four (new). A new indicator has been introduced to reflect that the
Standardized National Assessment Tests (ONE) sample, mainly an urban sample, has
been extended to include a statistically representative measurement of students learning
in rural schools in grades 3 and in grade 6. This is a key indicator which will allow
measuring student learning and its associated factors in rural areas.

       •   New Indicator: “Standardized National Assessment Test (ONE) sample
           extended and especially designed to assess student learning in grades 3 and in
           grade 6 in rural schools in 2007, 2010, and 2013?.

       -   Baseline:         No standardized national assessment test results for a
                              representative sample in rural areas.
       -   Target:           ONE conducted with an extended sample of rural schools
                            in years 2007, 2010, and 2013. Report with the comparative
                             performance 2007 and 2010 fed back to the provinces for
                             educational policy decisions.
Indicator Five (new): “Percentage of rural schools surveyed for the National Educative
Map?.

       -   Baseline:                  0 percent (2004).
       -   Target:                    100 percent.

Indicator Six (new): “Implementation of a web-based system to access the information
and results of the rural schools census?.

       -   Baseline:                  No system in place.
       -   Target:                    System designed and implemented.

These replace the intermediate results indicators below that have been dropped:

Former Indicator 6 (dropped). The indicator measuring timely availability of
educational statistics to be used for Project monitoring has been dropped as it is repetitive
with PDO Seven.

Former Indicators 7 and 8 (dropped). These indicators measuring the existence of
ONE with sample extended and specially designed to assess student learning in grades 3
and in grade 6 in rural schools has been dropped as it is repetitive with new indicator
Four.

Former Indicator 9 (dropped). The indicator measuring feedback of educational
statistics to schools has been dropped as it is repetitive with PDO indicator Seven.

Former Indicator 10 (dropped). The indicator measuring capacity building of
provincial Jurisdictions regarding compilation and use of educational statistics has been
dropped as it is repetitive with PDO indicator Seven.

Former Indicator 11 (dropped). The indicator measuring implementation of impact
evaluation studies and dissemination through seminars has been dropped as the
Government is assessing the design for impact evaluation of Project components.

Former Indicator 12 (dropped). The indicator measuring the strengthened capacity of
line units at the national and provincial levels has been dropped as the Government has
not been able to set quality standards regarding different administrative procedures
connected with fiduciary matters.
Financing

10.      Project costs. The cost of Component A (Improving Quality and Coverage in
Rural Education) is decreasing as the Ministry of Education has a more accurate estimate
of the cost of the goods, works, consultants and other services, training and operating
costs needed to implement the remaining activities. The cost of Component B (Enhancing
Stewardship Capacity of the Ministry of Education) is increasing as the Project supported
carrying out student learning assessments on an enhanced sample of rural schools and the
provision of feedback to such schools in the years 2006 and 2010. In addition, consultants
costs needed to support the provincial and national governments to implement Project
activities and components have increased since the Project’s implementation period is
being extended.

13.      Closing date. The closing date has been extended to December 31, 2013. This
extension is necessary to give the Government time to (i) achieve the PDO; (ii)
consolidate the teacher training activities to ensure sustainability of the rural modality;
(iii) analyze and disseminate preliminary findings of a learning assessment of 3rd and 6th
grades recently taken on a sample of urban and rural schools whose results will be
available by the fourth quarter of 2011; (iv) successfully implement the IPP of the
project; and (v) complete civil works currently under execution. The Government has
prepared an action plan to ensure completion of the Project by the extended closing date.
D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Economic and financial analysis

14.     Summary. This section presents an update of the economic analysis included in
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Report No: 33215-AR. It incorporates the longer
duration of the Project, recent labor market and education efficiency indicators, and
updated education costs. The analysis finds that the Project continues to be profitable
with a solid Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 11 percent. This revised IRR is lower than
the original 14.3 IRR reported in the PAD, but it is above the prevailing long term
interest rate.


15.     Detailed Analysis. The revised IRR of 11 percent is the result of internal
efficiency gains, increases in education attainment, and increases in government cost of
education due to the Project.


16.     Internal efficiency gains: The original economic analysis assumed an investment
per student of US$281, which would generate reductions in repetition rates and dropout
rates of 30 percent in grades 1 to 9.1 As the Project has taken longer to implement than
originally planned, the investment per student is reduced to US$198 (a reduction of 30
percent in investment per student). The lower investment per student diminishes the
impacts of the Project because less money is available to promote and/or retain students
in schools. The revised economic analysis reduces the expected impact of the Project on
repetition and dropout rates to 21 percent (a 30 percent reduction of the original expected
impacts included in the PAD).


17.     Increases in education attainment: Even though the impacts of the Project are
concentrated in primary and secondary education, the higher rate of survival at school has
consequences that span into tertiary education. Given the assumptions of the PAD, the
expected years of education per beneficiary increases by 0.9 years of schooling
(approximately 7 percent). Figure 1 presents the expected evolution of school attendance
of students under the Project.

    This economic analysis assumes the Project efficiency improvements span to grade 12.

                            Changes in School Attendance




18.    Given the current patterns of salary by year of education, estimates indicate an
increase in expected lifelong earnings of approximately US$2,500 due to increased
education attainment.

Safeguards

19.     The Project continues to be in full compliance with Bank safeguards. With
regards to the Indigenous People’s Development Plan, implementation is proceeding on
schedule. In September 2010, the Federal Education Council (Consejo Federal de
Educacion) approved legal resolution CFE 119/10 which defines the main aspects of
Intercultural Bilingual Education (IBE) for the nation. The resolution requires actions
from the Provinces to install, consolidate and strengthen IBE at the Province level, for
which the Bank is providing technical assistance in the context of Project supervision.
