Onlendisu Termss   Government to onlend to BIWTA (US$35.5 million) and BrWTC
(US$11.4 million) for 25 years, including a 5 years grace period
on principal, at an interest rate of 11.5 percent per annum, and
these loans would inclade both the proceeds of the IDA credit
and the Government's contribution. The remaining proceeds of
the credit would be provided as a grant to DOS.
Project
Descrigtion:        The project would improve inland water transport operations and
the effectiveness  of  sector agencies  through:    improving
waterway safety and environmental controls; improving inland
water  transport  infrastructure;  $mproving  capital  asset
utilization; reducing inland water freight transport costs;
improving the finances and operations of BIWTA and BIWTC; and
improving institutional capacity for planning and policy
formulation, and for the training of inland vessel operators.
The project would consist of: (a) an institution-building
component which would enhance the capacities of (i) DOS to
implement safety and pollution control regulations, including
environmental monitoring of dredging, and to train inland vessel
operators, (ii' BIWTA to improve its planning function and
operations, and (iii) BIWTC to restructure its fleet,
organization, personnel, and finances; (b) a vessel safety
improvement component which would include (i) implementation of
minimum navigation standards for day and night navigation on
Class I and II waterways, and (ii) upgrading of high frequency
communications systems and establishment of 24-hour distress
frequency monitoring at Chittagong, Dhaka and Mongla; (c) an
inland ports component to provide 100 launch landing pontoons
in rural areas; (d) a waterways development component which
would include (i) dredging to improve waterway access to she
northeast and to Baghabari Port in the northwest, (ii)
hydrographic survey equipment, and (iii) support equipment to
improve productivity of BIWTA's existing dredging fleet; and (e)
a country boat component to provide extension services to the
country boat sector.

Benefits
and Risks3          Benefits of the project ore expected froms (a) reduction* in
vessel casualties; (b) reductions in the unit costs of dredging;
(c) reductions in waterway transport costs on routes improved
by dredging and by allowing night navigation on additional
routes; (d) savings in vessel and passenger time and cargo
losses; and (e) improved environmental monitoring of operations.
Delays in project implementation, particularly with regard to
institutional and operational improvement action plans, are the
main project risks.  To address this, IDA will require the
establishment of a Project Monitoring Unit within the Ministry
of Shipping to secure 1,igh level oversight of project
implementation.

THIRD INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01     Bangladesh, for the most part, is comprised of a flat alluvial plain
crisscrossed by .. large number of rivers and water courses including some of the
world's largest rivers such as the Ganges/Padma, the Brahmaputra,Jamuna and the
Meghna. The country being extremely flat and low-lying, all three modes of
surface transport, road, railway and inland wtter transport (IWT) play
significant roles in the transport of both passengers and cargo. This is evident
from Table 1.1 below, which presents recent data for transport output and the
shares of the three surface transport modes. The relative roles of the transport
modes are evolving, with road transport expanding at the expense of railways, and
inland water transport reasserting its inherent cost advantages through increased
mechanization.  IDA has embarked on a major review of the transport sector,
to assess recent developments, and to improve coordination of sector Investments.
The following summarizes some key characteristics, problems and the current
situation for each of the three main transport modes.

Sourcess See Annex 1, Table 1.
A. The Three Surface Truasport Mdes
1.02     Road transport is the most dynamic area of transport development.  The
paved road network has expanded from a mere 600 km in 1947 to around 6,600 km
today. Freight volume carried by road transport has increased by over 50 percent
during the 19809 from around 11 million tons in 1981 to over 17 million tons in
1988. Similarly, passenger volumes have also increased from arnund 130 million
passengers in 1981 to over 210 million passengers in 1988. The market share of
road transport in the higher value commodities, particularly those whose
distribution is not controlled by the Government, has been increasing at the
expense of the railways. The primary reasons for the success of road transport
have been improvements in the road network and the better quality of service
provided by the largely private trucking industry. However, road transport is
likely to be constrained by the high cost of developing and maintaining an
extensive highway network in Bangladesh.   The numerous and shifting river

Program (UNDP) and being carried out by the World Bank as executing agency.



-2-
courses, periodic flooding and lack of construction materials result in high
investment costs for permanent river crossings and embankments, and high
operating costs due to the need for ferries.
1.03     Inland waterways are a critical component of the Bangladesh transport
system in view of the floods which regularly affect the country and disrupt the
other two surface transport modes. The inland waterway network comprises over
8,300 km of navigable waterways during the monsoon season; this reduces to about
5,200 km during the dry season. More than half of the country's total land area
is situated within a distance of 10 km of a navigable waterway. This network of
waterways carries about a third of- _ne total freight tonnage and a large
proportion of the passengers transpoi .4d within the country. A major problem
affecting inland water transport is the shrinking of the navigable network due
to both siltation and reduction in the amount of water available during the dry
season. The inland waterway system includes some eight major ports and numerous
(over 100) lesser ports. Operations at these ports are impaired by inadequate
facilities for mooring and unloading vessels, lack of facilities for storage, and
siltation in approach channels; the problems are compounded by the unpredictable
nature of the rivers which often change course, erode embankments, and in general
pose risks for investments in fixed riverfront infrastructure. A more detailed
discussion of the IWT system is provided in Chapter It.
1.04     Bangladesh Railways (BR) operates a network of around 2,800 roufe km of
which some 900 route km are broad gauge located in the western p&rn . the
country. The remainder of the network is meter-gauge. Th.'s inherent weakness
in the rail network stems from partition of the original network created by the
British in India; the concept then was to establish a core broad gauge network
with a meter gauge network on the periphery. In 1947, what is now Bangladesh
inherited a part of the core broad gauge netwoxk; however, these broad gauge
lines were cut off from their main ttaffic generating centers including the Port
of Calcutta. In addition to this mix of gauges, the rail network suffers from
the difficulties of the trans-Jamuna ferry crossings (at Bahadurabad and
Jagannathganj), closures due to floods, and poor mwanagement. Traffic on the
railways has declined substantially during the 19806, from 90 million passengers
and around 3 million tons of freight in 1981 to about 50 million passengers and
about 2.4 million tons of freight today. The most important issue at present
with regard to BR is the high level of direct and indirect subsidies provided by
the Government; BR revenues currently cover less than 70 percent of its operating
costs. The situation has been worsening, with BR share of traffic declining and
its costs increasing, and it is unclear what can be done to reverse this trend.
The single biggest question regarding future transport strategy relates to the
future role of the railways.
B. Sector OrMnitation
1.05     Development responsibility for the transport sector is divided between
the Ministry of Coummunications (railways and main road network), the Ministry of
Shippitg (inland water transport, ports and shipping), and the Ministry of Local
Government (rural roads). Coordination of sector development strategy has, to
the extent this actually takes place, been exercised by the Infrastructure
Division of the Planning Codmission. Private sector involvement in transport in
Bangladesh is extensive with the exception of two areast rail transport and the
vehicular ferries. The latter are operated by two public agencies, the Roads and
Highways Department (RHD) for the smaller vehicle ferries numbering around 70,



-3.
and the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation which is responsible for
three major ferry operations (Aricba-Daulatdia-Nagarbari, the Sirajganj Ferry and
the Mawa Ferry). In road transport, the public sector Bangladesh Road Transport
Corporation carries less than 10 percent of total traffic.  The Government owned
BIWTC's role in inland water transport amounts to 24 percent of the freight
market and 9 percent of the passenger market. It is generally accepted that the
private sector involved in transport in Bangladesh has been competitive and
dynamic, but suffers from an inability to undertake large investments.
C. Sector Financing
1.06     Resources flowing to transport and their allocation among transport
modes, have undergone some major changes during the 1980s (details are provided
in Annex 1, Table 10). Development expenditures for transport fell substantially
in mid-decade and have only partially recovered either as a percentage of total
development expenditures or in absolute terms (In 1988189 transport development
expenditures were 76 percent of 1980/81 levels in real terms).  During this
period, the main shifts within the transport sector were in favor of roads, the
share of which increased from around 35 percent to over 45 percent. Development
expenditures in the transport sector are increasingly dependent on external
assistance.   Project aid as a proportion of total development expenditures
increased from around 35 percent in 1980-81 to over 65 percent in 1988-89.
Recurrent expenditures for transport, however, have increased considerably; in
line with the rise in total recurrent expenditures. The allocation of recurrent
expenditures among modes shifted in favor of roads recently (from around 25
percent in 1985/86 to 33 percent in 1987/88), and this is partially the result
of IDA's Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Credit 1827-BD) which
required a substantial increase in maintenance allocations for the road sector.
D. IDA'. Sector Role and Assistance Strateagy
1.07     Since the creation of Bangladesh, IDA has maintained a continuing
presence in the transport sector in Bangladesh, concentrating primarily in the
areas of highway development, rural road infrastructure and the inland water
transport sector. The Association's dialogue with the Government on transport
sector issues has been extensive, particularly in respect of the proposed Jamuna
Multipurpose Bridge Project now being processed.   IDA and the Government of
Bangladesh (GOB' have also embarked on a UNDP-funded Transport Sector Study (para
1.01), which among other things, will serve to strengthen the Government's
capacity for planning and coordination of transport investments through the
establisbment of an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for Transport (IMSCT).
The IMSCT would provide a means for the Government to formulate transport sector
policies/objectives for each transport subsector that are consistent with overall
development objectives.
Previous IDA Operations
1.08     In the inland water transport sector, IDA has financed two relatively
minor operations. The Inland Water Transport Rehabilitation Project (Credit 424-
BD, approved August 1973, PPAR No. 4026, June 1982) financed spare parts and
equipment needed for rehabilitation of some vessels and modifications and repair
of the offshore oil terminal at Chittagong. The project was completed but with
-considerable delay. The delay was mainly the result of procurement difficulties.

The Second Inland Water Transport (Credit 735-BD, approved July 1977, PPAR No.
5778, June 1985) was primarily intended to prepare a medium-term investment
program for the sector. Various studies carried out under the second project
contzibuted to the preparation of this proposed project.
1.09     In the transport sector generally, IDA has financed the Fertilizer
Transport Project (Credit 1096-BD, approved January 1981, closed FY87) which
included components for BIWTA, BR, and the Chittagong Port Authority. The rail
component faced the greatest difficulty primarily in the area of procurement.
IDA is also assisting in the development of Bangladesh's main seaport at
Chittagong (Credit 1247-BD, approved May 1982, ongoing) and this project too has
been characterized by delays in procurement and contractor difficulties. In the
roads subsector, following two major highway operations which constructed
segments of the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway (Credits 408-BD and 964-BD, approved
June 1973 and May 1982, respectively, combined PPAR No. 7954, June 1989), several
other projects were not pursued because of disagreements concerning Government's
commitment to maintenance of the road network. In 1984, the Governaent requested
IDA to assist with rehabilitation of the road network, and the Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Pv%lect (Credit 1827-BD, June 1987, ongoing) was
initiated to rehabilitate or carry out ajor maintenance on about 660 km of roads
in the 16 new zilas of the Northwest Division, prepare a road master plan, and
develop an action plan to strengthen the  -'ostruction industry.  IDA is also
financing the Rural Roads and Markets Improve *nt and Maintenance Project (Credit
1940-BD, June 1988, ongoing). Two agriculture Rural Development Projects (Credit
631-BD, May 1976, closed FY84, and Credit 1384-BD, June 1983, closed FY90) also
cont.ined rural roads components.   IDA is p-, ,essing the proposed Jamuna
Multipurpose Bridge Project, which would be the ? it fixed crossing between the
eastern and western halves of the country, on the -b&sis of a UNDP-financed World
Bank-executed feasibility study (November 1989), and is also preparing a Second
Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project.
1.10     Several IDA operations have assisted Bangladesh to rebuild after natural
disasters and have included components for the transport sector. The Coastal
Area Rehabilitation and Cyclone Protection Project (Credit ?39-BD of FY73)
followed the 1970 cyclone, and the Flood Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1587-BD,
of FY85) responded to the floods of 1984.   The Second Flood Rehabilitation
Project (Credit 1876-BD of FY88) rehabilitated 1987 flood damages. It included
replac,ment of navigational aids, repair of jetties and a tugboat. Following the
1988 flood, which was even more severe than the 1987 flood, IDA approved the
Third Flood Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2048-BD of FY89) which included about
US$14 million for the IWT sector.   These emergency projects have generally
disbursed satisfactorily.
ProJect Sustainability
1.11     Previous experience in Bangladesh indicates that sustainability of
physical investments is fairly good, when viewed from the limited perspective of
economic return on investments, and this is despite considerable delays in
implementation.   The most difficult areas have been technical assistance
components and institutional development. In both areas, projects have faced
considerable difficulties in implementation, and when implemented, in utilizing
tne results.  Problems primarily arose in procurement of professional ser-tces
which always require time consuming high level decisions.   In retrospect,
implementation problems might have been better addressed through a permanent



-5-
project zoordination unit at the ministry level, particularly when a project
involves multiple agencies.
Rational, for IDA Involveuent
1.12     Since IDA's two projects in the 1970s,  IWT agencies have relied
extensively on fragmented support from various bilateral donors whose relatively
constrained resources have naturally restricted the scope and durat.on of their
activities. As a result, no comprehensive effort has evolved to develop the
inland waterways of Bangladesh. Dredging operations, for instance, have actually
declined to about half the levels achieved in the early- to mid-19809.  The
proposed project is included in the draft Country Strategy Paper for Bangladesh
and in the Government's Three-Year Rolling Plan (Priority Investment Program) for
FY91-93. IDA's involvement in this project, and in the process of developing the
core investment rprogram for IWT, will address some of the more immediate needs,
including policy reform and institutional strengthening, in this important
transport subsector.
II. INLAND WATER TRANSPORT
2.01     Recent forecasts for 1995 of IWT modal share are presented in Annex 1,
Table 1, and these range from 15 percent to 24 percent of passenger and 30
percent to 37 percent of freight transport demand. Clearly, IWT will continue
to play a significant role in both passenger and freight movements. Applying the
lowest forecasts for both total transport output and lIWT mode share produces IWT
output levels in 1995 which are higher than at present: IWT passenger-kilometers
increase from around 5.6 billion pass-km to at least 6.3 billion pass-km in 1995
(i.e., 2 percent growth p.a.); and IWT ton-kilometers increase from around 1.7
billion ton-km to at least 2.2 billion ton-km over the same period (i.e., 5
percent growth p.a.).
2.02     IWT tends to play a larger role in the south and southwest of Bangladesh
as would be expected given the estuarine nature of this part of the country. The
south and southwest are also among the poorer regions of the country and are the
areas most subject to natural disasters from floods and cyclones, and therefore
the least friendly environment for the other transport modes. The map attached
(IBRD Map No. 22359) she, - the distribution of passenger and commodity flows
indicating that a large proportion of transport needs in the south and southwest
are met by IWT. The following sections summarize the role and performance of the
IWT system and details are provided in Annex 1.
2.03     The IWT system in Bangladesh is both extensive and well-connected with
the rest of the transport system. This is clear from comparisons with a country
such as China which is one of the more intensive users of MT  in Asia (Annex 1,
Table 2). In terms of traffic intensity, Bangladesh's inland waterway network
generates about 2.3 million passenger-kilometers and 670 thousand ton-kilometers
per route-kilometer of waterway, whh.le for China, equivalent figures are 140,000
passenger-kilometers and 1.9 million ton-kilometers per route-kilometer. The
important difference is the much higher reliance on waterways for passenger
transport in Bangladesh than in China. The density of inland ports and terminals
is much higher on the Bangladesh waterways with approximately 6 berthing
facilities per 100 route-kilometers versus on average 1 facility per 100 route-
kilometers in China. The density of passenger facilities on Bangladesh waterways
is also high at around 60 per 100 route-kilometers.



-6-
A. Performace of Inlad Water Transport
2.04     Despite this  favorable environment  for waterway development,  the
performance of inland water transport in Bangladesh is poor by almost any measure
of system performance. Annex 1 (Table 3) provides comparators for Bangladesh and
the Chaugjiang (Yangtze) waterway system in China on a few key productivity
measuces.  The data highlight the low level of utilization of IWT assett in
Bangladesh. Low levels of capital asset utilization in the cargo sector (ton-
kmlton of capacity) primarily rssults from the existence of a substantial -urplus
in the inland cargo fleet. This situation has developed partly as a result of
misguided investment incentives in the past, but also as a result of inadequate
enforcement of construction and vessel condition requirements. It is estimated
that cargo vessels in the inland fleet now spend on average around 200 days per
year awaiting repairs, awaiting berth space ox idle. It is estimated that the
nonproductive time of these vessels could progressively be reduced to around 120
days per year on average. In waterway maintenance operations, &.redging output
(cubic meters per dredge per year) of the Baagl%desh Inland Water Transport
Authority (BIWTo) dredge fleet is around a third of that achieved under  .imilar
conditions elsewhere. Partly, this is due to an excess of dredge capacity, and
partly to inadequate operating procedures and funding.
2.05     Perhaps the most critical area of poor performance of the Bangladesh
inland water transport sector relates to vessel safety.  Over the five-year
period 1984-88 for v,ich data is available, there were 56 major passenger vessel
accidents, which is a rate of almost one such incident per month. About 40
percent of accidents are caused by overloading of vessels resulting in capsizing.
These overloading accidents, which are entirely preventable (as much of it
results from poor policy, e.g., low tariffs), are extremely costly in loss of
lives.   Another 40 percent of accidents are collisions which are caused by
inadequacies in navigational marks and incqmpetency of vessel creus. Only 20
percent of the accidents were caused by natural phenomena. Data on overall
fatalities are unreliable, however considering that each vessel carries on
average about 150 passengers, the total loss of life in these accidents could be
well over 1,000 each year.
D. Institutional Frmework
2.06     The MW'.nistry of Shipping (KOS) is responsible for all Government
functions  in  the  inland water  transport  sector.    It  discharges  these
responsibilities through three agencies namely the Bangladesh Inland Water
Transport Authority (BIWTA), the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation
(BIWTC), and the Department of Shipping (DOS). The first two are autonomous
entities which are expected to be self-financing.   BIWTA is responsible for
maintaining all waterway infrastructure including channels, inland ports and
other public facilities. BIWTC operates a fleet of vessels engaged in ferry
services, inland and coastal cargo services, and inland and coastal passenger
services. DOS is responsible for most regulatory and training functions, though
in some areas, its mandate appears to overlap with that of BIWTA.
2.07     Institutional capacity in the IWT sector appears to have weakened in the
mid- to late-1980s.   Planning and data collection activities, which are an
important element of BIWTA's activities,, do not receive adequate attention.
Training capabilities, especially of deck personnel who are critical to safe
vessel operation, also need to be enhanced. Currently, BIWTA is mandated to



regulate both passenger and freight tariffs through establiabment of maximum and
minimum tariffs. In practice, only a single tariff is established (called the
maximum tariff) and a minimum charge (minimum charge irrespective of distance)
is set.  As a result, tariffs in the sector are fixed at low levels thereby
encouraging operators to overload vessels. Both BIWTA and BIWC suffer from low
operational efficiency, high cost of operations and poor revenue generation.
These weaknesses would be addressed under the proposed project.
C. Development Objectives and Strategy
2.08     Government, in collaboration with donor agencies working in the InT
sector, has set out short- to medium-term development objectives for IWT under
the Fourth Five-Year Plan (FY91-FY95).   The objectives and the Government's
strategy for attaining these are:
2.09     Improve Vessel Safety:  The Government's major emphasis in Improving
vessel safety is the prevention of overloading, and in general, the enforcement
of safety regulations.   This will also require improved passenger tariff
regulation that is less restrictive and encourages investment in passenger
transport capacity. Secondly, Government intends to provide better training for
inland vessel operators and improved safety systems on the waterways, including
night navigation aids on heavily trafficked routes, raiio comuunication among
vessels and to shore stations, proper charting and marking of waterways, and safe
passenger landing facilities.
2.10     Ensure Adequate Inland Passenger Transport Capacitys  Government will
seek to improve the current overloading situation by addressing both sides of the
capacity equation: demand and supply.   Tariffs for passenger transport are
currently set at low levels, and are to be progressively deregulated which would
result in some price increases.   This is expected to both reduce passenger
transport demand and attract additional investment in vessels thereby increasing
fleet capacity.
2.11     Improve Capital Asset Utilization: Enforcement of regulations would
force many operators to scrap or otherwise remove obsolete cargo vessels from the
active fleet. This will simultaneously improve the productivity of the remaining
fleet and enhance its physical condition. Provision of improved shore facilities
will also improve fleet utilization.   In waterway maintenance oparations,
utilization of dredging assets will be improved through improvements in
operational practices (e.g. three shift working), consolidation of dredging
responsibilities under a single Drodging Unit within BIWA, and through provision
of adequate operating funds tied to productivity enhancements.
2.12     Reduce Freight Transport Costs on IWT:  Reductions in freight transport
costs wili be achieved primarily through fleet reductions and producti'tty
enhancements outlined above. Additional cost savings are available through
improvements in channel conditions and at inland ports on the main IWT routes
(Dhaka to Chittagong, Dhaka to Khulna/Mongla, and Dhaka to Chattak in the
northeast). These routes account for around 80 percent of output in the formal
IWT sector. The Government will seek to improve navigation (particularly night
navigation) and channel conditions on these routes to allow the use of more
efficient tonnage (larger vessels). For shippers to receive the benefit of these
.aprovements, the Government will also deregu',ate freight tariffs in the sector.



-8-
2.13     Encourage Development of Country Boat Sector:   Country boats in
Bangladesh perform almost as well and sometimes better than the 'modern'
mechanized inland fleet (Annex 1, Table 3), and considev' g their very
significant role in the rural areas of Bangladesh particularly with regard
employment of the rural poor, the Government is encouraging their increased
participation in inland water transport.  Currently, there are around 20,000
larger country boats (above 5.5 tons capacity) engaged in cargo transport, and
around 160,000 smaller boats used for passenger an    rgo transport.  At least
10 percent of this fleet is now mechanized with the productivity (ton-km output)
enhancements from mect-.Z'-7.ation ranging from a factor of 2.0 to 2.5.  While
transport cost saving, f ros %iechanization are not substantial, mechanized vessels
provide more reliab   be. ice and increased safety due to their improved
maneuverability and X-i-e   For these reasons, the Government would encourage
improvements in this sector. The Government's strategy includes measures such
as providing infrastructure and facilities for technical extension services.
2.14     Improve Finances of BIWTC:  Improving the financial viability of BIWTC
is a key objective of the Government. This can be achieved by rationalization
of its operations (particularly in the cargo sector which suffers by far the
largest losses) and reduced staffing, to be accomplished through L program of
early retirement, and redeployment of surplus staff to other functional
responsibilities within BIWTC or to other agencies involved in inland water
transport, e.g., to DOS for vessel inspections.
2.15     Improve Institutional Capacitys  The Government recognizes that the
planning and policy formulation function at BIWTA needs to be strengthened
through expanding its staffing and through creation of an additional Member of
the Board responsible for planning and operations. Environmental and safety
issues will be better addressed through establishment of an Inland Ship Safety
Administration within DOS. Training capabilities will be consolidated under DOS,
and will be strengthened through upgrading of the Inland Deck Personnel Training
Center.
D. Public Expenditure for IWland Water Transport
2.16     The share of water transport in overall public expenditures (Annex 1,
Table 10) appears to have remained fairly steady at around 30 percent of
transport development expenditures and around 10-12 percent of transport-related
revenue budget expenditures. Development budget allocations for water transport
are, however, misleading because they include allocations for the development of
the main seaports of Chittagong and Mongla. Adjusting for this, the inland water
transport sector allocation in the development budget reduces to less than 10
percent, which corresponds with the allocation in the revenue budget (the
seaports produce operating surpluses and are not dependent on the revenue
budget).
2.17     Within the context of projected resource constraints, the Government has
prepared a prioritized investment program for the IWT sector, with a view to
ensuring that core elements receive priority attention. Investment needs of the
IWT sector have been identified for five areas of the inland water transport
secto-:   (a) vessel safety (US$11 million); (b) waterway development (US$22
million); (c) inland ports and passenger facilities (US$43 million); (d) inland
fleets (US$67 million); and (e) institutional development (US$10 million),
totalling US$153 million. This total level of public investment is much higher



-9-
than the expected availability of domestic and external resources during the
Fourth Plan period. The overall program has therefore been ranked into a core
program (US$55 million) and Priority I investments (US$62 million) and Priority
II investments (US$35 million).  The Priority Investment Program is shown in
Annex 2, and details are in the project files.
2.18     Based on the above core program, Priority I development expenditures,
and estimated maintenance expenditures for IWT, less increased revenues from
increases in BIWTA and BIWTC tariffs, projections for total Fourth Plan outlays
for the IWT sector have been prepared. Table 2.1 relates these projections to
overall projections for the Annual Development Plan (ADP) and the Revenue Budget
over the Fourth Plan period.  The projections for ADP and the Revenue Budget
assume a 3.5 percent growth in these budgets from planned FY91 levels, and this
is in line with IDA estimates of future GDP growth. On the assumption that IWT
receives 1.2 percent of overall allocations (10 percent of transport allocations,
and transport receives 12 percent of the total which corresponds to historic
levels), the projected outlays are well within historic levels for both the
development budget and the revenue budget.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01     The proposed Third Inland Water Transport Project (IWT-11) comprises
various components intended to address some of the key problems the Government
faces in the IWT sector, and would support the core program of the Government's
Priority Investment Program for the sector. The projict focuses primarily on
development of the waterway system in the south-west and north-east of Bangladesh
as shown in the attached map (IBRD Map No. 22007).



-10-
A. ProJect Origin
3.02     The project grew out of a realization that IWT was critical to the
country especially during floods, that safety standards were poor, that the
infrastructure was rapidly deteriorating as a result of past neglect, and that
a number of policies and practices in the sector were exacerbating the situation.
As part of preparation, a Master Plan for the IWT sector has been prepared with
technical assistance from the Netherlands.  In addition, IDA has executed a
number of studies funded by the United States Trade and Development Program in
1989 on vessel safety, dredging, navigation aids, hydrographic surveys, training
and institutional development. IDA has also executed a study of the BIWTC fleet
funded by the United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry Trust Fund. Based
on these, the Government has formulated the Priority Investment Program (PIP) for
the IWT sector which will constitute the Fourth Five-Year Plan (4FYP, 1991-1995)
for this sector. In addition, project preparation has emphasized preparation and
agreement on a number of policy papers and development strategies which underpin
the project concept. These include: a Strategic Plan for BIWTC, an Operations
Improvement Action Plan for BIWTA, Institutional Development Action Plans for
DOS, BIWTA and BIWTC, and Financial Recovery Action Plans for BIWTA and BIWTC.
B. ObJectives
3.03     By financing the core program for IWT, the project would seek to ensure
that the Government can address the essential elements of its development
strategy.   The objectives of this development strategy ares   (a) improving
waterway safety and environmental controls; (b) increasing inland passenger
transport capacity; (c) improving capital asset utilization; (d) reducing inland
water freight transport costs; (e) improving country boat operations; (f)
improving the finances of BIWTA and BIWTC; and (g) improving institutional
capacity for planning, policy formulation and training of inland vessel
operators.
C. Project Description
3.04     The various components of the project have been grouped into five parts,
as follows:
Part A: DredginM (BIWTA - US$3.0 million)
3.05     Selected waterways would be deepened as needed to ensure that 1.8 meters
of water are available at all seasons. Dredging works totalling 10 million mO
would be carried out by force account at a rate of about 2 million m9/year using
BIWTA's dredges as followss (a) 2 million m9 at the Ajmiriganj section of the
Meghna-Kushiyara River; (b) 1.3 million ma at the Baulai section of the Kangsa
River; (c) 1.7 million ma in the Titas River; and (d) 5 million mP for
rehabilitation of certain patches of Class I and Class II waterways,V including
access to Baghabari Port. The project would finance part of the cost of dredging
21 'Class I Waterway" means a waterway with a minimum navigable depth of 12
feet; and 'Class II Waterway' means a waterway with a minimum navigable
depth of 6 feet.



-11-
operations  based  on  fuel  and  repair expenses.    IDA has  considered  the
international aspects of this component, in particular, dredging on the Meghna
River. Although this is an international waterway, the works proposed under this
project would not adversely affect the quantity and quality of water flows to any
riparian countries. Similarly, the works would not be adversely affected by the
use of water that riparian countries might make.
Part B: Aids to Navigation (BIWTA - US$6.8 million)
3.06     Aids to navigation on about 1,200 km of Class I and Class II waterways
will be upgraded to secure day and night navigation by rehabilitating existing
equipment and providing new floating and shore lights, buoys, beacons, etc., as
well as replacement of about 75 percent of acetylene powered lights with solar
powered lights. This would mainly involve procurement and installation of about
400 shore lights, 50 lighted buoys and 100 unlighted buoys. Waterways to be
upgraded are:  (a) all Class I and Class II waterways; (b) proposed Class II
waterway from Bhairabazar to Chattak;  (c) waterway approaches to Mongla and
Chittagong seaports; and (d) Aricha-Daulatdia-Nagarbari, Bhuapur-Sirajganj, and
Mawa ferry routes.
Part C: Inland Pontoon Facilities (BIWTA - US$7.5 million)
3.07     Presently, there are about 1,400 landing stations at which launches
handle passengers and cargo.   Of these, only about 230 have pontoons to
facilitate passenger and cargo movements. An additional 100 pontoons, including
five spare pontoons to replace those being maintained or repaired, and their
access bridges would be provided under the project at selected locations
conforming to the pontoon location criteria agreed with Government (Annex 3).
Part D: Equipment (US$19.1 million)
3.08     The project includes numerous smaller components as follows:   (a)
procurement of equipment for rehabilitation of 5 BIWTA 18-inch cutter suction
dredgers including fuel monitoring systems (Annex 4, para 2); (b) procurement of
spare parts (Annex 4, para 3) and floating support equipment for BIWTA's dredgers
(Annex 4, para 4); (c) purchase and installation of equipment to upgrade BIWTA
and BIWTC's High Frequency (HF) telecommunication system (Annex 4, para 12 and
Annex 5, para 34) and establishment of distress frequency monitoring at Dhaka,
Mongla and Chittagong (Annex 4, para 13); (d) purchase of inland survey work
boats and accommodation barges for BIWTA survey crews (Annex 4, para 19); (e)
procurement and installation of an electronic position fixing system to replace
BIWTA's existing Decca system (Annex 4, para 19); (f) rehabilitation of selected
BIWTC vessels within the overall parameters established for the BIWTC fleet in
the Strategic Plan (Annex 5, para 31); (g) procurement of miscellaneous equipment
and facilities for BIWTC including fuel monitoring systems (Annex 5, para 34);
(h) purchase of 6 speed boats to DOS for safety patrols (Annex 6, para 17); (i)
purchase of equipment for strengthening the DOS Inland Deck Personnel Training
Center (Annex 6, para 19); (j) purchase of equipment for DOS for environmental
control (Annex 7); and (k) purchase of equipment and facilities for country boat
owners associations to be established by BIVTA (Annex 8).
Part Es Technical Assistance (US$6.5 million)
3.09     The following technical assistance components woild also be financed
under the project:  (a) implementation of BIWTA Operationu Improvement Action



-12-
Plar. (Annex 4); (b) management consultancy to implement the agreed BIWTC
Strategic Plan (Annex 5); (c) project design and coordination support for the
Project Monitoring Unit of MOS (paras 3.17 and 3.18); (d) establishment of Inland
Ship Safety Administration within DOS (Annex 6, pares 15-18); (e) preparation for
DOS of an environmental mapping of the waterways (Annex 7, para 2) and
development of implementing regulations for environmental protection of inland
waterways (Annex 7, para 4); and (f) assistance to DOS to develop the Inland Deck
Personnel Training Center (Annex 6, para 19). Total work months of technical
assistance required is estimated at about 410.
D. Cost Estimates
3.10     The total cost of the project,  including contingencies,  taxes and
customs duties is estimated at US$64.2 million equivalent, of which US$47.2
million equivalent (73.5 percent) is the estimated foreign cost component. Taxes
and duties would amount to US$8.8 million equivalent. A summary of the cost
estimate is given below and details are in Annex 9.

3.11     Cost estimates for civil works and equipment reflect July 1990 prices
and the current exchange  rate of US$1 - Tk 34.22.   Thev are based on
international prices for similar works and equipment as well as recently executed
works in Bangladesh. Estimates for technical assistance are based on an average
of US$10,000 per work-month (expatriate technical assistance is estimated at
US$12,0001work-month and local consultants are estimated at US$2,000 per work-
month). Physical contingencies of 10 percent on average have been added. Price
contingencies are 4.9 percent annually from 1990 to 1995, 4.3 percent for 1996
and 3.7 percent for 1997 to 1999. The above project components and cost estimate
have been discussed and agreed upon with the Government and were confirmed at
negotiations. Approval by the Government of the proiect proformas for carrying
out the proiect will be a condition of effectiveness of this IDA Credit.
E. Financing and Disbursement
3.12     The IDA Credit of US$45 million equivalent would finance:   (a) all
foreign exchange costs of the project except for those technical assistance
components which would be financed by a grant of US$5 million equivalent from the
Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA), and the environmental control
components, which would be financed by a grant of US$0.7 million equivalent
provided by the Japan Grant Facility (JGF); and (b) 43 percent of the local costs
excluding taxes and customs duties. IDA, FINNIDA and JGF contributions would
thus cover 79 percent of the total project cost. The Government would provide
the balance of the local costs (US$4.7 million equivalent) and BIWTA, BIWTC, and
DOS will finance their respective shares of taxes and customs duties (totalling
US$8.8 million equivalent) out of their own budgets. Effectiveness of the grant
agreement between the Government of Banaladesh and Finland and the Japanese grant
agreement will be conditions of effectiveness of this IDA Credit. The financing
plan, including taxes and customs duties, would be as shown in Table 3.2t

3.13     In order to enable BIWTA and BIWTC to finance their respective
components of the project, the Government will onlend to them US$35.5 million and
US$11.4 million equivalent, respectively, each for 25 years including five years

of grace, at 11.5 percent p.a. The execution of the subsidiary loan sgreements
with the above two organizations will be conditions of Credit effectiveness.
Agreement was reached with the Goveranent that it will include the funds for DOS
components in its regular budget allocation in accordance with the agreed proiect
implementation schedule.   The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the
Borrower.
3.14     Disbursement of the IDA Credit proceeds will be on the following basis:
(a)  Dredgirg (para 3.05): 30 percent of the total cost.   Using BIWTA
experience and adjusting for anticipated increases in efficiency, the
approximate cost of dredging 10 million m3 is US$10 million of which
US$3.0 million is for fuel and repairs. The Design and Coordination
Consultant will thus release US$0.30 for each cubic meter certified as
dredged to cover the cost of fuel and repairs. Agreement was reached
that the Government will establish an organizational unit for dredging
within BIWTA prior to use of any of the funds provided for dredging
under the Credit. This is a condition of disbursement.
(b) Navigation Aids and Inland Pontoons (para 3.06 and 3.07): 75 percent
of the total cost.
(c) Equipment (para 3.08): 100 percent of foreign expend&.ture, 100 percent
of local ex-factory expenditure, and 78 percent for other items
procured locally, except for the environmental cortrol component which
would be financed by the JGF.   Agreement was  reached that the
Government would satisfactorily complete a study of alternative
electronic position fixing systems, in accordance with terms of
reference satisfactory to the Association, prior to use of any of the
Credit proceeds for the procurement of such a system.   This is a
condition of disbursement.
(d) Technical Assistance (para 3.09 (f)]: 100 percent of the total cost.
Agreement was reached that the Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre
(DPTC) would be transferred from BIWTA to DOS prior to use of any of
the Credit proceeds for technical assistance to DPTC.   This is a
condition of disbursement.
Withdrawal applications to IDA would be fully documented with contract documents
for works, goods and services each costing US$50,000 or more. Reimbursement for
expenditures related to dredging works under force account and contracts each
less than US$50,000 will be made against certified Statements of Expenditure
(SOE). Documentation supporting SOEs need not be submitted to IDA but would be
retained in each project agency and the Project Monitoring Unit and made
available for review by IDA representatives on request. In order to facilitate
disbursements, a Special Account in US Dollars would be established in the
Central Bank of Bangladesh on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The
initial deposit would be US$1.8 million equivalent representing an estimated
average of four months of project expenditures. The Special Account will be used
exclusively for IDA's share of financing. Disbursements from the Special Account
will be for actual expenditures and these expenditures are to be authorized by
the Project Coordinator as head of the Project Monitoring Unit (para 3.17).
3.15     The proposed project would be the first comprehensive Bank Group
operation in the inland water transport subsector in Bangladesh. Consequently,



-15-
historical disbursement data from previous transport sector operations has been
used to project disbursements. An eight-year disbursement schedule is proposed
on this basis. The estimated schedule of Credit disbursement is given in Annex
10.  The project completion date is December 31, 1998, and the project would
close June 30, 1999.
F. Project ImPlementation
3.16     Tender documents for the main components have been reviewed by the
Govertment and IDA, and prequalification of contractors is scheduled for July
1991, tendering for October 1991, contract awards for March 1992, and project
completion for late 1998. The schedule of project implementation is detailed in
Annex 11, and was discussed and agreed at negotiations.
Project Monitoring Unit
3.17     The Government has established a Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) within
MOS which will be responsible for coordinating project implementation. A Project
Coordinator, who will report directly to the Secretary,  MOS, has also been
appointed.   The PMU includes three full-time Deputy Project Coordinators
appointed in consultation with the beneficiary agencies, BIWTA, BIWTC and DOS,
each responsible for implementation of their respective project components. Each
of the three agencies will also appoint a Project Director within the respective
agency.   In addition,  the PMU will be staffed with an adequate number of
qualified full-time staff to coordinate implementation of the project, undertake
procurement actions, oversee implementation of action plans (para 4.08), handle
withdrawal applications and prepare progress reports. The PMU will be supported
in its work by the Design and Coordination Consultant.
Design and Coordination Consultant
3.18     Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations that MOS
will appoint Design and Coordination Consultants (financed by FINNIDA) to be
responsible for coordinating various aspects of the project, for implementing the
BIWTA Institutional Development Action Plan and Inland Ship Safety Administration
components of the project and for assisting the Project Coordinator in reviewing
designs and tender documents, organizing tender evaluations, ensuring timely
letting of contracts, monitoring progress and costs, and in controlling the
project budget.   Detailed Terms of Reference for the Project Design and
Coordination Consultants were discussed and agreed, and are attached as Annex 12.
The consultants would be engaged under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Appointment of the Project Design and Coordination Consultant will be a condition
of Credit effectiveness.
BIVTC Mana8ement Consultant
3.19     The GOB delegation confirmed that the BIWTC will engage a Management
Consultant (financed by FINNIDA) to assist BIWTC management in the implementation
of the BIWTC Strategic Plan.   Detailed Terms of Reference for the BIWTC
Management Consultant were discuased and agreed, and are attached as Annex 13.
BIWTC Management Consultants will be engaged using the same procedure as that for
the Design and Coordination Consultants. Appointment of the BIWTC ManaRement
Consultant will be a condition of Credit effectiveness.



- 16-
Implementation of Physical CoMponents
3.20     All physical components of the project would be implemented under the
supervision of the Design and Coordination Consultants. The consultant would
certify satisfactory installation and testing of equipment.   In the case of
dredging works, the consultant would c_rtify pre- and post-dredging surveys and
would authorize withdrawal requests of Credit proceeds at the rate of US$0.30 per
cubic meter dredged.   For the inland pontoons component,  the Design and
Coordination Consultant would review pontoon sites proposed in respect of the
agreed  "Criteria  for Pontoon Locations* (Annex  3).   In  supervising the
navigational aids component, the consultant would ensure that the contractor's
designs for marking of individual waterways are adequate from a safety point of
view, meet relevant international standards, and are cost effec ive.
Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre
3.21     The Government confirmed during negetiations the high priority it
attaches to strengthening the Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre (DPTC), and
the need for expert assistance in designing and establishing a revised training
program which would be responsive to the needs of the sector.  However, the
Government would like to explore the possibility of grant financing for this
component. If grant financing is secured by Credit effectiveness, the portion
of the Credit allocated to this component would be appropriately reallocated.
A decision on engaging the International Labor Office (ILO) to provide expert
services will be made simultaneously with resolution of the grant assistance
question; engagement of ILO for providing such services would be acceptable to
IDA in view of ILO's extensive experience in this field and previous involvement
in the DPTC.
Mid-Term Review of the ProJect
3.22     Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations that a
review of the project will be carried out within two years of the date of Credit
effectiveness but no later than June 30, 1993. This review will be based on the
variouis target indicators agreed and set out in Annex 14-- "Project Monitoring and
Supervision Indicators." These indicators will be revised during the review to
reflect actual accomplishments and revised targets will be established to cover
the period to the end of the project. In preparation for this review, the Design
and Coordination Consultant would draft briefing papers on each of the project
components and the agreed action plans for circulation to the Government and
donors. These briefing papers would cover the degree of achievement on various
performance targets (Annex 14), implementation status, problems encountered, and
proposals for any changes in project scope, costs and timetables.
G. Supervision and monitoring
3.23     The project would require 20 professional weeks of IDA supervision
during each of the first two years, 30 weeks in year three (during the mid-term
review), and 15 weeks per year thereafter.  The total requirement, including
preparation of the Project Completion Report, would come to about 145 staff
weeks.   This supervision input would be required to review procurement and
payments in respect of a large number of small contracts and to ensure sufficient
attention to the early project experience so as to minimize the need for any
further restructuring following readjustments made at the mid-term review.

3.25     Dredging would be carried out by BIWTA under force account not to exceed
an aggregate of US$3.8 million. Aids to navigation and inland pontoons estimated
at US$21.0 million would be the subject of two single responsibility turnkey
contracts covering supply of materials and equipment, construction, installation,
testing and 12 months maintenance. These contracts would b% awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA's Guidelines
for Procurement. Individual packages valued in excess of US$200,000 equivalent
up to a total of US$24.4 million of the equipment would be procured by ICB under
several contracts depending upon the type of equipment to be purchased and
manufacturers specialization. Each of these contracts would cover provision of
equipment, installation and testing. Civil works not exceeding the equivalent
of US$50,000 each, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1,000,000
equivalent, may be procured on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA, provided, however,
that dredging works under Part A of the project may be carried out through force
account.   Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or less per
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of US$2,000,000,
may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding,
advertised locally, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA. Items or
groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000 per
contract, '!p to an aggregate amount not to exceed that  equivalent of
US$5,000,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison



-18-
of price quotations solicited from a list of suppliers from at least three
different countries ellgible under the Guidelines in accordance with procedures
acceptable to IDA. Procurement documentation and decisions relating to packages
valued in excess of US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to prior review by
IDA, and it is estimated that contracts for 80 percent of the total Credit amount
would be subject to such review.   Prequalification of contractors would be
carried out for the contracts covering aids to navigation and pontoons.
Qualifying domestic contractors for such works will receive a preference in the
bid evaluation of 7.5 percent of the total contract cost.   Bids offering
domestically manufactured goods and equipment will receive a preference in the
bid evaluation of the value of the applicable import duty or 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price, whichever is lower. The above arrangements as outlined in paras
3.24 and 3.25 were discuss d and agreed upon during negotiations.
I. Reporting
3.26     Responsibilities of the PMU, including the requirement for reporting are
given in Annex 15, and these were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.
Reporting on the project will be reviewed periodically and adjustments made as
necessary.  Upon completion of the project, the three beneficiary agencies,
BIWTA, BIWTC and DOS, will each prepare their respective parts of the Project
Completion Report with the assistance of the PMU. The Government will retain the
PMU for a period of one year after the date of closing of the Credit.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DBVELOPMWT
4.01     As part of project implementation, each of the three GOB agencies
(BIWTA, BIWTC and DOS) will undertake specific actions to improve their
effectiveness. This section summarizes these institutional development actions,
and details are provided in Annex 6. Organizational arrangements of OS for the
IWT sector are shown in Chart 1.
A. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority
4.02     BIWTA has the primary mission of developing the water transport system;
its mandate however includes elements that are regulatory in nature. The
Authority is managed by a Board consisting of a Chairman and five members, two
of whom are full-time with functional responsibility for eugineering and finance.
BIWTA has a sanctioned staff strength of 3,978 and a posted strength of 3,125,
and is generally believed to be understaffed for the extent of its
responsibilities. The organization structure of BIWTA is as shown in Chart 2.
4.03     Institutional weaknesses identified in BIWTA's current structure and
operations  include:    weak  implementation  of  regulatory  responsibilities
particularly in tariff regulation; lack of authority and capacity within the
planning function; fragmentation of responsibility in dredging operations; and
a nearly defunct training capability at the Inland Deck Personnel Training
Centre. Under the pro'ect, BIWTA would undertake a number of actions to rectify
institutional weaknesses. These include: transfer of all regulatory functions
in the area of vessel certification to DOSt consolidation of all dredging
activities under a single organization unit having control over the full



-19-
Government budget allocation for BIWTA dredgir;, operations; transfer of the
Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre to DOS; expansion of staff through
recruitment of about 600 surplus staff from BIWTC; and enhancement of the
planning function by appointment of a new Member of the Board for Planning and
Operations. Transfer of the Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre to DOS will
be a condition of disbursement for this component [Part E (f) of the project].
Establishment of the Dredging Unit within BIWTA would be a condition of
disbursement of Part A (dredging) of the project (para 3.14). The Government
will also deregulate all IWT freight tariffs, and evidence of eere&ulation of IWT
freight tariffs would be a condition of Credit effectiveness of the project.
B. Banzladesh Inland Water Transport Corpc,ration
4.04     BIWTC operates a fleet of over 400 vessels on the coastal and inland
waterways. BIWTC is managed by a Board of Directors (appointed by MOS), which
consists of the Chairman and three members. The Corporation employs 5,900 staff
organized into four major departments: Maintenance and Operations, Commercial,
Finance and Administration. The Corporation is expected to be self-financing but
has been incurring substantial deficits over the years. In FY89, it incurred a
deficit of Taka 68 million on revenues of Taka 342 million. A majority (90
percent) of the losses are accounted for by the cargo sector, which suffers from
excess fleet capacity, poor operational performance, and substantial cargo
losses.
4.05     Under the project, BIWTC would implement a strategic plan (Annex 5) to
restore it to financial viability over the Fourth Plan period. The plan calls
for reducing the fleet from over 400 vessels to under 150 vessels, with a large
proportion of the reductions being in the cargo sector. The Corporation would
also establish five profit centers: coastal passenger, inland passenger, coastal
and inland cargo, ferry services and a ship repair profit center. This will
allow separation of the financial performance of each of these business units,
and enable appropriate disposition of each in the future. Management Consultants
appointed under the project would recommend for each profit center either
retention within the Corporation, privatization or liquidation. It is expected
that the coastal passenger operations would be retained as this is a public
service obligation of the Government and BIWTC would be psovided a direct subsidy
for operating the coastal passenger services. In line vlih the fleet reduction,
BIWTC would reduce  its  staffing to around 3,700  staff.   This would be
accomplished through a combination of early retirements (about 1,000 staff) and
redeployments to BIWTA and DOS (about 1,200 itaff). BIVTC would also takeover
from BIWTA the Barisal Workshops, which would become a part of the BIWTC ship
repair profit center.
C. Department of ShippiLn
4.06     DOS is a relatively new organization and though iPs mandate calls for
it to be the primary regulatory body overseeing inland water transport, many
regulatory functions continue to be exercised by BIWTA.   It is headed by a
Director General of Shipping who reports to the Secretary, MOS.  Since its
inception ir 1976, DOS has made substantial progress in the areas of safety
regulation, maritime pollution and manpower training. Its activities in the IW
sector however require considerable strerthening.



-20-
4.07     Under the project, DOS would takeover a number of activities from BIWTA.
These includes vessel design approval and certification, and the training of
inland vessel crews. The institutional d0velopment action plan for DOS calls for
the establishment of an Inland Ship SatLty Administration (ISSA). ISSA would
have responsibility over both vessel safety and environmental protection of the
waterways. DOS would take over the Ialand Deck Personnel Training Centre (DPTC)
from BIWTA.   In order for DOS to fulfill its expanded responsibilities,
particularly for enforcing safety regulations on the waterways, its staff
strength would gradually be increased by about 600 staff who would be recruited
from the surplus staff at BIWTC.   An understanding was reached with the
Government that DOS would receive an increased budget to reflect the increased
cost of its safety related activities (Annex 14).
D. IMplementation of Agreed Action Plans
4.08     The following action plans, which were prepared by GOB and discussed
with IDA, were agreed at negotiations, and will be implemented by the Government,
BIWTA, and BIWTC. These are:
(a)  BINTA Operations Imx rovement Action Plan (Annex 4) which requires
measures to improve dredging output from about 2 million cubic meters
per year to 6 million cubic meters by 1995, maintenance of navigation
aids and hydrographic survey operations;
(b) BIWTC Strategic Plan (Annex 5, Part F) which includes restructuring of
the fleet from over 400 vessels to under 150 vessels and rehabilitation
of selected vessels, implementation of tariff increases for ferry and
passenger services, and phasing out of cargo operations;
(c) BIWTA Institutional Development Action Plan (Annex 6, para 7) which
includes restructuring the organization for dredging, deregulation of
freight tariffs, redeployment of staff from BIWTC, increased ea4hasis
on planning, and transfer of training functions to DOS;
(d) BIWTC Institutional Development Action Plan (Annex 6, para 12) which
includes establishment of five profit centers and reductions in staff
through redeployment and early retirement; and
(e) DOS Institutional Development Action Plan (Annex 6, para 14-19) which
includes consolidation of training functions for the maritime sector in
DOS, and establishment of an Inland Ship Safety Administration
responsible for saVety and environmental controls.
These action plans are based on recommendations of consultant studies, which were
conducted in preparation of the project (Annex 19). These studies include: (a)
the BIWTC Fleet Development and Rationalization Study, which formed the basis for
the BIWTC Strategic Plan; and (b) several studies funded by the United States
Trade and Development Program, which formed the basis for the institutional
development action plans, and BIWTA's operational improvement action plan.' The
Project Monitoring Unit (para 3.17) will be responsible for monitoring the
implementation of these action plans and for assessing the success of specific
actions in achieving desired objectives (Annex 15). Progress reports on each
action plan would be prepared by each agency and consolidated by the PMU for
review by the Government and donors.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
5.01     This  section  evaluates  the  financial  performance  and  financial
management of BIWTA and BIWTC, and recommends changes in tariffs, and financial
and operating policies which would help improve their overall performance.
A. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority
5.02     BIWTA has always been financed by a combination of Govern.ent budget
allocations, and its own revenues from conservancy and pilotage, inland ports and
canal tolls. To date, there has been no explicit policy regarding cost recovery
or  financial  targets  for  BIWTA.    Government  believes  BIWTA's  financial
performance has been unsatisfactory, and would like to see financial reforms
implemented.   The recommended measures and financial targets comprise an
integrated financial recovery plan (Annex 16, para 12).  The plan is desiV.ed to
encourage financial discipline and sufficient liquidity for operational and
investment requirements.   The paragraphs below provide a summary of BTWTA's
financial performance, and details are in Annex 16.
5.03     Past Financial Performance.  Table 5.1 below sumharizes the audited
accounts of BIWTA for the period 1984 to 1988. BIWTA's financial performAnce is
characterized byt   (a) low tariffs and an erratic revenue performance; (b)
accumulating long-term debt; (c) apparent excess liquidity, as evidenced by its
current ratio; and (d) poor billing collections. It is necessary to establish
separate responsibility centers for revenue and regulatory activities in order
to account consistently for each.  The net loss in 1988 dropped to Tk 5.3
million, from Tk 48.3 million in the previous year. The annual loss is, however,
understated throughout the period, because interest charged does not reflect true
interest expense. BIWTA's balance sheet shows accumulating long-term debt, which
is not being serviced regularly. As of June 30, 1988, this debt amounted to Tk
883.3 million. Under the proposed project, GOB has agreed to reschedule the
total outstanding long-term debt (as of July 1, 1990) over a period of 20 years?
with an effective interest rate of 9 percent p.a. as a condition of credit
effectiveness for the project.  The high current ratio does not reflect the
correct liquidity position because of excessive stocks of inventory, some -f
which are unusable.   BIVTA would revalue all stocks, and sell obsolete and
mismatched stocks by FY93. Accounts receivable include arrears that have been
outstanding for a long time and are unlikely to be collected. BIWTA would write
off some arrears, enforce collection of those that can be collected, and thereby
reduce the level of accounts receivable to about four months of revenue by FY94.
These and other actions have been included in a financial recovery action plan
(Annex 16, para 12) which was discussed and agreed with the Government at
negotiations, and will be reviewed annually by IDA and BIWTA.

5.04     BIWTA Tariffs and Revenues. The projections below depend critically on
increased tariffs and recurrent Government allocations for nonrevenue services.
On tariffs, BIWTA's sources of revenue consist of (a) port charges; (b)
conservancy fees; (c) pilotage fees; (d) canal charges; and (e) dredging charges.
A description of these tolls and charges is found at Annex 16, Table 4. These
tolls and charges have not been revised recently, and they do not reflect the
cost of providing services. DIWTA recognizes the need to increase its revenues
and is committed to increase them to cover costs of operation and debt service
(Annex 16, Table 3). BIWTA will be expected to progressively increase tariffs
to cover full cost of operations of its revenue earning services plus the greater
of depreciation or debt service. To this end, IDA sought in increase of 30
percent in BIWTA tolls and charges as a condition of Board Presentation of the
project and this has been accomplished. Hereafter, BIWTA will revise tariffs
annually to generate sufficient revenue to cover the costs of all revenue earning
operations including operating costs and depreciation or debt service by 1995.
These annual reviews are estimated to result in a tariff increase of about 25
percent in FY92, declining to about 4 percent in FY94. BIWTA is not expected to
cover the costs of its nonrevenue earning services. At present, allocations do
not cover the cost of services. Agreement was reached at negotiations, that the
Government will exchange views with IDA annually on the financial projections f r
BIWTA including measures to enhance tariffs and allocations for nonrevenue
earnang services and implement such increases to ensure that BIWTA meets its cost
recovery obiectives.
5.05     Financial Proiections.  Projected financial statements are included at
Annex 16, and are summarized in Table !.2 below. BIWTA's objective over the
project period will be to cover the costs of revenue-earning operations from its
own revenue by 1995. The level of recurrent Government allocations to BIVTA has
been insufficient to effectively develop and maintain the waterways. Government



-23-
allocations will increase to reflect increased dredging operations. It is also
expected that operational cost reductions will be achieved through the
implementation of a fuel monitoring system under the project.   With these
expected policy actions, BIWTA can achieve a marginal profitability of about Tk
15.8 million by the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

5.06     BIWTC's stated financial objectives are to operate commercially ensuring
that revenues generated from its services are sufficient to cover all operating
expenses including the greater of depreciation or debt service, and contribute
to about 10 percent of its annual capital investment costs. BIWTC's financial
projections indicate that, if it implements needed reforms, it should be able to
achieve deficit free operations by the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1995.
Details of the financial evaluation of BIWTC are provided in Annex 17, and the
following paragraphs provide a summary.
5.07     Past Financial Performance.  BIWTC's past performance was assessed on
the basis of audited financial statements covering the period FY84 to FY88, and
is given in Annex 17. Table 5.3 below provides a summary of key finmacial data
for this period. The average annual growth in revenue over the five-year period
was two percent; cargo revenues declined continuously, wbile ferry revenues
increased significantly. Expenses have risen largely due to Government wage
increases. Net losses increased from Tk 4.9 million in 1984 to Tk 53.1 million
in 1988. Over 90 percent of these losses were in the cargo sector, and only the
ferry sector made profits.

5.08     BIWTC's balance sheet is characterized bys (a) a low debt to equity
ratio; (b) outstanding interest on debt; (c) a high level of accounts receivable
(most of it uncollectible); and (d) a high level of stocks and inventories of
which 50 percent are obsolete.   The low debt to equity ratio results from
conversion of some debt into equity in 1985 and inclusion in reserves of a 1988
borrowing from GOB (in anticipation of a conversion into equity). As of June 30,
1989, outstanding principal was Tk 708.7 million while the outstanding interest
was Tk 176.2 million. At negotiations, IDA reached agreement with the Government
to reschedule the total outstanding long-term debt (as of July 1, 1990) over 20
years besinning in FY92 at an effective 9 percent rate of interest which is an
average rate for the out anding loans. Agreement was also reached to have
BIWTC's overdue interest converted into Government equity. These aRreements are
conditions of Credit effectiveness for the project.
5.09     Under the proposed project, BIWTC would implement an action plan to
reduce the level of its accounts receivable to about four months of revenue by
the end of FY94. Additionally, IDA would seek assurances that BIWTC will carry
out a detailed inventory valuation and verification of all stocks and spares on
a basis satisfactory to IDA, and will sell off or dispose all obsolete, damaged
and mismatched stocks. During negotiations, assurances were received that these
actions would be completed by end 1993.
5.10     BIWTC TAriffs.  BIWTC's passenger and freight tariffs are established
by BIWTA, as the regulatory agency responsible for IWT operations. Although
tariffs are supposed to be revised periodically, this is not always the case, and
current tariffs do not reflect the cost of providing services. In October 1989,
BIWTC increased ferry tariffs by 30 percent. This increase was a step in the
right direction, but further increases are needed if BIWTC is to reach its
financial objective.   During negotiations,  IDA sought agreement with the
Government to revise and implement tariff increases (Table 5.4 below) as follows:
(a) proposed tariffs regrouping in the ferry sector resulting in an effective
increase of 15 percent; and (b) a 25 percent increase in the passenger sector for
all classes  of passengers.    These  increases were  a condition of Board
Presentation of the project and have been fulfilled. Agreement was also reached



-25-
at negotiations that the Government and IDA will exchange views on BIWiC's annual
financial proiections (includinR subsidies for coastal operations) and that
tariffs will be progressively increased to cover the full cost of operations and
the greater of debt service or depreciation plus a 10 percent contribution to
investment by 1995. These annual tariff reviews are estimated to result in a
tariff increase of about 10 percent in FY92 declining to 5 percent by FY95 (Annex
14).

out above; (b) the implementation of a fuel monitoring eystem whiclh will cut fuel
costs by about 15 percent; and (c) implementation of the staff retrenchment
program, which will reduce staff costs by about 20 percent.

5.12     Financial Management.   Budgetary control, particularly on recurrent
expenditure is poor, and actual expenditures are usually considerably higher than
budgeted figures. Under the project, the management consultants proposed as part
of the strategic plan (para 3.19) would have the resoonsibility of assisting
BIWTC prepare annual work programs and accompanying budgets, and also train
accounting and planning staff. BIWTC maintains an audit division, which reports
to the Member Finance. This structure needs to change to have the audit division
report directly to the Chairman, to ensure autonomy of the audit function. A
financial recovery action plan for BIWSC (Annex 17, para 13) was discussed and
agreed during negotiations, and the targets and performance outlined in the
action plan will be reviewed annually by IDA and BIWTC.
C. Accounts and Audit*
5.13     DOS, BIWTA and BIWTC would maintain separate accounts of project
receipts and expenditures. These accounts and Statements of Expenditures (SOB)
for which Credit disbursements will be made, would be audited annually by the
Comptroller and Auditor General, GOB. The audit report would contain a separate
opinion by the auditors that all disbursements made on the basis of SOEs were for
works and services, including dredging, which were required for the project, and
that the SOEs can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.   The
accounts and reports of these audits would t1e submitted to IDA within nine months
of the end of the fiscal year. The books and accounts of BIWTA and BrWTC would
be audited annually 'y independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The auditors'
reports would be submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of the fiscal
years of BIWTA and BIWTC.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01     Economic  evaluation  of  the  project  is  based  on  the  following
improvements to the inland water transport system:
(a) day and night navigational aids to be provided on five main
navigational routes (totalling approximately 1,200 route kilometers)
will improve navigation on stretches of waterway totalling around 725
kilometers and reduce the need for pilots and associated vessel delays;
(b) dredging works to improve least available depth (LAD) along three
inland river routes (Kushiyara, Kangsa and Titas Rivers) from 0.9 m to
1.8 m will reduce transport costs, and dredge operations improvements
will reduce the unit cost of dredging from Taka 28/cu m to Taka 21/cu
m; and
(c) improvements in berthing facilities at 100 rural locations for launches
to load and unload passengers and cargo will reduct delays to vessels
and passengers, and damage to cargo.
The above system improvements correspond to three groups of investments financed
under the projectt navigation aids, dredging and rural pontoons, which account
for 71 percent of total project costs. Details of the analyses are in Annex 18.



-27-
A. Iconuoic Cost Estmates
6.02     For this analysis, all inputs and outputs have been evaluated in
constant June 1990 economic prices. Financial costs were converted to economic
costs by shadow pricing major cost components and by applying aggregate
conversion factors estimated for Bangladesh to the remaining components. Price
contingencies,  taxes and duties are excluded.   Conversion factors used for
various cost categories were:   (a) for fuel - 0.85; skilled labor - 0.89;
unskilled labor - 0.7; and (b) for other domestic items the standard conversion
factor of 0.80.
B. Bstimation of Benefits
6.03     The Aid8-to-Navigation component of the project would generate benefits
through reductions in (a) average vessel delays awaiting pilots, and (b) voyage
times due to improved speeds enroute.  The savings realized are the avoided
operating costs of the vessels through elimination of these delays.   Non-
quantified benefits would include improved safety and reductions in vessel
damage/losses resulting from improved channel markings. The benefits accrue to
both passenger and cargo vessels, though the value of these savings differ based
on the average vessel sizes used on various routes and operations. Details on
the computation of benefits are presented in Annex 18, Tables 2 to 4.
6.04     Dredging improvements included in the project achieve benefits through:
(a) reductions in the unit (economic) cost of dredging from Taka 28/cu m to Taka
2l1cu m; and (b) reductions in cargo and passenger transport costs from Taka
1.39/ton-km and Taka 0.32/pass-km, to Taka 0.90/ton-km and Taka 0.27/pass-km on
the three routes (Kushiyara, Kangsa and Titas River) where the Least Available
Depth is increased from 0.9 m to 1.8 m. Details of the evaluation are provided
in Annex 18, Tables 5-8. These river routes are important transport arteries for
stone materials used for construction in Bangladesh (the lack of adequate stone
supplies in most areas is a major constraint for the construction sector
throughout the country). Improved channel depth on these routes will reduce the
cost of construction in much of Bangladesh.
6.05     Rural launch landing pontoons to be financed under the project will
result in improved accessibility to the rural areas of Bangladesh.   The
quantifiable benefits stem primarily from savings ins  (a) vessel time; (b)
passenger time; (c) handling cost of cargo; and (d) reduced damage to cargo.
Without the project these rural areas are being served by vessels which cannot
come alongside the shore, and passengers and cargo must be ferried to and from
the vessels by small country craft.   This results in significant delays to
passengers and damage to cargo. Details of the evaluation are in Annex 18,
Tables 9-10.
6.06     Benefit estimates are conservative in that no estimates are made of
traffic generated on account of cost reductions. Most importantly, however,
there is no quantification of safety improvements and reduced loss of life and
property from IWT accidents.

C. Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivity AnaliY.
6.07     For each of the above three components  (and their subcomponents)
economic rates of return (ERR) and their net present values (NPV) at a 12 percent
discount rate, were computed and details are provided in Annex 18. Sensitivity
analyses was carried out for a 15 percent reduction in benefits, a 15 percent
increase in costs, and for a combination of the two with a one year delay in
benefits. Results obtained are summarized in Table 6.1 below.

/a Combined effect of 15 percent decrease in benefits, 15 percent increase in
costs and a one year delay in benefits.
6.08     For the overall package of investments to be financed under this
project, the rate of return has been calculated based on the benefits quantified
for t%e above mentioned three components, but with the costs including all of the
technical assistance and other components for which benefits have not been
quantified (Annex 18, Table 11). This resulted in an ERR of 15.7 percent and a
NPV (at a 12 percent discount rate) of Taka 344 million.
6.09     The sensitivity analyses presented in Table 6.1 above indicates that
even with the combined effects of a one year delay, a 15 percent decline in
benefits and a 15 percent increase in costs, the project components obtain fairly
high  rates  of return.    Investments  proposed are well  diversified,  both
geographically and functionally, and therefore the overall benefit stream is
likely to have lower risk. Also, the project is unlikely to suffer from extended
implementation delays due to the simple nature of most of the physical
components.   The economic justification of these investments is therefore
reasonably robust.
D.  Environmental Assessmzat
6.10     An environmental assessment of the IWT sector (financed under the
Netherlands Trust Fund) was undertaken by IDA in the preparation of this project.
Protection of the environment is presently governed by the Environment Pollution
Control (EPC) Ordinance of 1977.   The Department of Environment Pollution
Control, under the newly created Ministry of the Environment, acts as the
regulatory agency. A "Marine Pollution Ordinance' has been drafted by DOS and



-29-
has been passed as an Act of Parliament.   The latter ordinance primarily
addresses pollution in the coastal waters and seaports of Bangladesh. Whereas
the EPC Ordinance of 1977 is intended to cover inland waterways, no implementing
regulations have been developed as yet covering specific activities such as
dredging, construction of structures affecting waterways and other waterway
development actions.
6.11     Among the key findings of the environmental assessment carried out by
IDA, the following are most noteworthy: (a) no testing is carried out of dredge
materials prior to disposal; (b) there is no data on possible contaminated *hot
spots" in the bottom sediments near industrial plants; and (c) there are no
emergency plans established to deal with incidents involving hazardous cargoes.
6.12     Under this project, a number of actions are to be taken to address the
above deficiencies. First, an environmental map of the waterway system is to be
created identifying specific environmentally sensitive areL. and activities.
Such a mapping and the upkeep of the associated Geographic Information System
would enable quick environmental assessments of proposed waterway activities.
Second, simple test facilities for dredge materialslbottom sediments will be
provided and personnel will be trained in the use of this equipment. Third,
technical assistance will be provided to DOS to develop implementing regulations
for the protection of inland waters.   Annex 7 provides details  on the
environmental actions under the project.
6.13     Potential environmental risks associated with the physical interventions
under the project are considered negligible. Dredging operations contemplated
are generally far removed from industrial plants where sediments may be
contaminated, with the exception of dredging that may be carried out in the
Buriganga River. For the latter diked (contained) disposal of dredge materials
will be employed if testing reveals the need to do so. The environmental aspects
of dredging will be improved under the project since for the first time,
Bangladesh will undertake dredge materials testing for all dredging works.  In
most cases, it is expected that in-stream disposal will be acceptable in view of
the general lack of contaminated sediments and the high ambient turbidities in
Bangladesh's rivers. Inland pontoons financed under the project are unlikely to
create significant dislocations in rural areas as these pontoon locations are
already serving as landing stages for inland vessels. The project, however, does
require BIWTA to ensure that selected locations provide adequate facilities to
prevent adverse impacts on adjacent populations and land-use patterns (Annex 3,
Criteria for Location of Pontoons).
B. Special Considerations
6.14     The project will have some implications for elements of the Bank's
programs of special emphasis. Poverty alleviation in the water transport sector
primarily requires improving the condition of country boat operators.  These
boats employ many landless rural poor. The project would assist them through
establishment of facilities and extension services to improve their access to
technology and capital (Annex 8). The project also places a major emphasis on
improving the infrastructure available to country boat operators by financing 100
pontoons to be located in rural areas as landing stages for country boats and
launches. This would benefit the rural poor indirectly by lowering transport
costs, increasing mobility, reducing prices of purchased commodities and raising
farmgate prices of agricultural outputs. With respect to resource mobilization,



-30-
the project will include a number of actions to increase Government revenues in
the water transport sector, and to reduce the deficits of BIWTC. These include
increases in the tariffs for the use of BIWTA facilities, BIWTC ferries and
passenger vessels, and rationalization of BIWTC operations. The project also
indirectly impacts on the condition of women in Bangladesh. Post data indicates
that a disproportionate number of the fatalities on the waterways are women and
children who are trapped under-deck when vessels capsize. Through its emphasis
on safety on the waterways, the project should significantly reduce casualties
among water transport passengers.  The project also creates the conditions
necessary for future privatization of parts of BIWTC operations. By separating
pure public service obligations (coastal passenger services) from other
operations, and further segregating profitable sectors (ferry services) from
lossmaking operations (cargo), the Government will be well situated to
appropriately dispose off those operations where it no longer needs to be
involved.
1. Project Risks
6.15     The  most  significant  risks  faced  by  the  proiect  lie  in  the
implementation of the various technical assistance components and action plans
for improvements in operational efficiency, financial performance and for
institutional change.   Whereas there is strong Government commitment for
undertaking these actions at present, with the inevitable rotation of key
officials, implementation will require persistence on the part of project
personnel and the various Government agencies involved. These risks are managed
through provision of appropriate technical assistance which has been put in place
as conditions of Credit effectiveness.   In order to minimize the risk of
implementation delays, the Project Monitoring Unit has been made responsible for
taie action plans in addition to the usual responsibility for monitoring
implementation of physical investments. A detailed set of project monitoring
Indicators (Annex 14) has also been prepared to assist the Government and IDA
supervision missions to closely monitor implementation.

THIRD INLAND vTmR TRANSPORT PROJCT
Inland Water Transport Sector
1.       This Annex sets out the current status and development needs of the
inland water transport (IWT) sector in the context of preparations for the Fourth
Five Year Plan  (4FYP,  1991-1995)  of the Government of Bangladesh  (GOB).
Observations made here are primarily based on a number of studies2
(a)  Bangladesh  Inland Water  Transport  Master  Plan  (BIWTMAS)  - DHV
Consultants, The Netherlands and BETS Ltd., Bangladesh, November 19883
(b)  Reports prepared by Water Resources Congress as consultants to the

Navigation, November 1989; and
ic) BITWC Pleat Rationalization and Development Study, by University of
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne as consultants to IDA, April 1989.
This paper also benefitted from various analyses carried out by GOB and IDA
staff.
2.       The importance of inland water transport for Bangladesh is evident from
Table 1 which shows current and projected modal shares of road, water and rail
transport.   Even though there is considerable uncertainty attached to the
forecasts, it is clear that inland water transport will continue to play a
significant role in both passenger ari freight movements. Taking the lowest
forecasts for both total transport output and IWT mode share produces IWT output
levels in 1995 which are higher than at presents IV? passenger-kilometers will
increase from around 5.6 bxllion pass-km to 6.3 billion pass-km in 1995; and TWT
ton-kilometers will increase from around 1.7 billion ton-km to 2.2 billion ton-km
over the same period. A few additional observations are noteworthy.

First, the share of IWT in passenger transport in Bangladesh is very high
compared to other countries, reflecting the essentially riverine geography of
Bangladesh. Second, IVT transport flows in Bangladesh are dominated by passenger
movements which is the reverse of the situation in most countries. Both of these
observations indicate that passenger transport is a major function of the inland
waterways, and hence IWT development should specifically consider the needs of
passengers.
A. Performance of the IRT Sector
3.       In order to assess the relative performnce of the IWT sector in
Bangladesh, it is useful to examine comparative data from other countries. Since
data was available for the Peoples' Republic of China, Table 2 provides Chinese
comparators which were selected to avoid significant distortions due to the very
different absolute magnitudes involved in any comparison between China and
Bangladesh. Once again, the importance of passenger transport for Bangladesh is
evident, with a traffic intensity of an order of magnitude greater than that
found on China's waterways. Also, interesting is the relatively high density of
ports on Bangladeshi waterways (6.7 per 100 route km vs. 1.0 in China), which
indicates that Bangladesh's waterway system is comparatively well integrated with
the rest of the transport system and hence can play a strong role in economic
development. 'Whereas no comparative data was available on passenger facilities,
the density of such facilities (58 per 100 route kms) in Bangladesh indicates
again the good access that exists to the waterway system--approximately one
passenger landing per 4 kilometers on each river bank.

4.       Inspite of this favorable environment for waterway development, the
performance of inland water transport in Bangladesh is poor by almost any measure
of system performance.   Table 3 provides comparators for Bangladesh and the
Changjiang (Yangtze) waterway system in China on a few key productivity measures.

Sources: op cit.
The data highlights the extremely low rates of utilization of capital assets in
Bangladesh. While the low output levels for fleet capacity as well as installed
horsepower are partially explained by the lower volumes of ereight flows (in
comparison with China), the difference is so large that it can only be explained
by a very large surplus of tonnage in the cargo sector of IWT. This is borne out
by other analysesl/ which indicate for instance that the Bangladesh Inland
Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) could very comfortably carry the total annual
cargo that it now does with one third of its existing fleet. Also, of interest
is the substantial improvements available from introduction of never
technologies.   The ratio of capacity to installed horsepower is around 3-4
tons/HP on the Changjiang whereas in Bangladesh, with a similar if not more
favorable (lower current velocities) river system, the equivalent figure is 1 to
2 tons/HP. Introduction of newer vessel technologies will however depend on the
market for IWT services, and a prior concern must be rationalization of the
existing fleet to eliminate inefficient vessels. This will also improve the fuel
consumption performance of the existing "modern* cargo fleet which now performs
not much better than the much smaller mechanized country boats. Such elimination
of inefficient tonnage would be based on strict enforcement of vessel
classification rules and safety requirements.
5.       In view of the above, it is no surprise that water transport costs in
Bangladesh present potentially large opportunities for reduction. Table 4 below
sheds some light on this with respect to freight transportation costs. It is
interesting to note the similarities between inland water transport costs in
India and Bangladesh.   The former alsn has neglected development of the

6.       The financial performance of the two sector agencies involved in the
inland water transport sector has been poor; however, BIVTA's financial situation
has improved remarkably. Both BIWTA and BIWTC depend on substantial allocations
from the Government for continued operations.   Key financial data for both
agencies are presented in Table 5.

The situation for both agencies would, however, be much worse if their financial
statements fully reflected the interest charges on existing debt obligations.
Financial viability of both of these organizations is feasible if steps can be
taken to improve operational efficiency in the utilization of assets and
personnel, reduce revenue leakages and pilferage, and enhance revenues through
appropriate  pricing  of  services.    There  is  also  a need  for  financial
restructuring in order to enable them to service their debt in the future.
7.       Perhaps the most critical area of poor performance of the Bangladesh
inland water transport sector relates to vessel safety. Passenger vessel
casualties for the period January 1981 to December 1985 were compiled based on
data provided by the Department of Shipping, Government of Bangladesh. Over this
five year period, there were 47 passenger vessel disasters, involving 62 vessels.
These disasters do not include numerous country boat casualties that go
unreported. Summary data on casualties are presented in Table 6. Overloading
accidents (40 percent of the total) are clearly preventable. Of the remaining,
improved safety systems should be able to at least halve the casualty rate.
Collisions occur as a result of inadequate channel markings and lack of trained
vessel crews; note that only four of these 47 incidents involved a country boat.
Loss of lives are not reported here because the data is unreliable with
substantial underreporting.   However, when one considers that each of these
vessels carry in excess of 150 passengers, it is not difficult to imagine that
these 62 casualties have resulted in loss of lives probably numbering in the
thousands.

8.       Waterway maintenance  has  also  deteriorated  in  the  recent past.
Quantities dredged by the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) and
the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) dredge fleets have reduced
significantly as shown in Table 7 below.   In 1986-87, the total quantities
dredged were less than 60 percent of the level achieved in 1984-85, and the
situation had only improved slightly in 1987188 when the dredged quantities
increased to about 75 percent of the level achieved in 1984185.

9.       Utilization rates of dredge equipment is also very low in comparison
with the potential capacity of the equipment. As a result of reduced working (16
hours per day, 6 days per week) and nonavailability of inputs such as fuel and
spare parts, dredges in Bangladesh typically perform at around 40 percent of
their potential capacity. Comparisons between estimated weekly dredging output
of comparable equipment in the US versus in Bangladesh are provided in Table 8
below.

10.           Hydrographic surveys of the waterways carried out by BIWTA have
also fallen substantially below requirements. Based on the data for three fiscal
years 1985-86 to 1987-88, the total hydrographic survey output has been less than
half of targetted requirements. The reasons for this have been inadequacies in
the availability of hydrographic survey boats and degradation in the performance
of the DECCA electronic position fixing system.

S. Sector FinanciAn
11.           Table 10 shows the evolution of the Annual Development Plan (ADP)
and recurrent budgets over the 19809 for total public expenditures and for the
transport sector, and the shares of the three transport modes. Some of the more
significant changes that have occurred in the recent past includet in 1983184,
the share of the road sector in the development budget increased from a
historical level of around 35 percent to over 45 percent, while the share of rail
declined from around 35 percent to less than 25 percent. More recently the share
of rail appears to have declined even further.  In 1986-87, the maintenance
budget allocation for roads was increased from historical levels of around 20-25
percent to around 35 percent.   This is partially the result of IDA's Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Credit 1827-BD), which required a
substantial increase in maintenance allocations for the road sector. The share
of inland water transport has remained relatively stable and has not, in general,
reflected the relative importance of this mode in overall transport supply--this
is discussed in greater detail in Chapter II.

Criteria for Launch Pontoon Locations
Locations selected for siting of pontoons should fulfill the following
conditionst
(a) on the shoreside the pontoon must be within 1 km of, at a minimum, a
public road, and provision must be made for connecting the site to the
road network with a public road;
(b)  on the shoreside, the pontoon site must include at least 1,000 sq m of
public access land without any encroachments other than structures and
facilities required for the normal handling of passengers and cargo
over the pontoon;
(c)  the site must be an existing landing station for launches, and traffic
at the selected landing station must now exceed 40,000 passengers or
20,000 tons of cargo per annum or the sum of these two numbers should
at least total 40,000;
(d) two pontoons shall be sited at least 5 kms apart whenever there is land
communication available between the two sites;
(e) pontoons shall be located on waterways having year round navigational
access by vessels drawing four (4) feet of water;
(f)  pontoons shall be located at sites where the shoreline at Low Low Wate:
(LLW), is less than 20 m from the pontoon; and
(g) no pontoon shall be located where it is likely to pose a hazard to
navigation.
Most foreshore land is already owned by BIWTA and therefore it is not expected
that resettlement will be an issue in selecting pontoon sites.

BIWA Operations I prove"ent Action Plan
A. Dredging
Introduction
1.       Dredging of the waterways in Bangladesh is mainly the responsibility of
BIWA. Dredging operations are adversely affected by the following factors:
(a)  Inadequate annu*l dredging budget allocation.   Budgeted funds are
inadequate to properly operate and maintain the present fleet of
dredgers, much less any addition to the fleet or expansion of work.
(b) The current work week consists of six worn-ing days per week and one or
two eight-hour. shifts per day. No oper tion or maintenance work is
accomplished on the third shift or on t'  seventh day.
(c) All dredging operations lack in attendant plant, including floating
derricks, dredge tender boats, anchor barges, and tugs resulting in
slow mobilization of equipment, poor movement between jobs and reduced
dredging efficiency once dredging operations have commenced.
(d) The poor condition, or the complete lack, of monitoring instrumentation
normally used by dredge operators to maximize production, as well as
the lack of trained workers and supervisors at the job site.
In view of the foregoing GOB and BIW!A undertook to implement the following
Action Plan by June 1993.
Rehabilitation of Dredges
2.       The existing fleet of 18' cutter suction dredges will be deployed as
follows:
(a) 3 of the oldest dredges will be designated for standby status; and
(b) 5 dredges will be refurbished with new instrumentation and all 5 will
be mobilized during the 4 months of maximum maintenance dredging work
load.   After the peak load demand,  scheduled maintenance will be
carried out on one dredge at a time leaving 4 dredges to work during
the off peak period. The repair and improvement of instrumentation
includess
(i)   installing new suction vacuum and discharge pressure gauges to
the main pump, complete with service water or pneumatic reverse
flush blowdown clean-out systems. The gauges should be mounted
at or near the operators's console in the lever room, with repeat



-43-
Annex 4
Pogo 2 of 7
or duplicate gauges in the engine room at or near the engineer's
station. The operating valves for the clean-out systems are to
be located in the lever room adjacent to the operator's console;
(ii) installing suction vacuum and discharge pressure recording gauges
in the lever room on the opposite side of the clean-out system
from the gauges at the operator's console.   These recording
instruments must be furnished in locking-type cabinets complete
with a one year's supply of smoked vacuum and pressire recording
charts and spray-type fixes; and
(iii) installing shoreside and shipside fuel monitoring system to
control and improve efficiency in fuel consumption and usage.
Procurement of Spare Parts
3.       A complete inventory of spares will be prepared by the end of the first
year. No procurement of spare parts will be made until a complete inventory of
existing spares is performed, with the obsolete spares identified and disposed.
Spare parts will be purchased by soliciting international tenders and disbursed
as needed to perform capital work.
Procurement of DredBe Support Equipment
4.       BIWTA will procure the following items of dredge support equipments
(a) Four 40-foot Dredge Tender boats equipped to perform light towing of
dredge plant; and
(b) Four Floating Stiff Leg Ten (10) ton capacity derricks equipped to
handle dredge pipe.
Detailed technical specifications of both of the above items are in the project
files.
Dredge Operating Schedule
5.       Starting July 1991 three dredges will be manned to operate 3 shifts of
8 hours each, 6 days per week. Remaining 2 dredges will operate 2 shifts of 8
hours each, 6 days per week. At the end of one year this method will be reviewed
with the objective of going to the third shift on all dredges as qualified
personnel become available. A bonus system will be instituted to provide an
incentive to exceed a base rate production of 35,000 cubic meters per week per
dredge.
Disposal of Dredged Materials
6.       All dredged materials will be tested prior to disposal.   Dredged
materials may be deposited overboard, except in designated environmentally
sensitive areas. However, any Buriganga River sediments, adjacent to the Port
of Dhaka would be contained within a diked disposal area.

Disbursemnt of Fuel Cost of Dredgins Works
7.       Total BIWTA dredging to be supported under this project is forecast at
2 million mP/year of which 1.0 million e8 is capital dredging.   Using BIWTA
experience and adjusting for anticipated increases in efficiency; the approximate
variable cost of dredging 10 million in', exclusive of labor cost is estimated as
follows:

a/ Market price US$1/gallon.
The design and coordination consultant will release US$0.30, to cover the cost
of fuel and repairs, for each cubic meter certified as dredged.
Training of Dredge Operators
8.       BTWTA will carry out a program for personnel training that includes:
(a) On-the-job training of the present number of levermen operators to
sharpen and improve their operating skills.   A selected cadre of
engineers from management should be included in this initial training
program.
(b)  Establish permanent training classes for operating personnel.   The
initial instructors for these classes are to be the same personnel who
provide and install the new instrumentation and who conduct the
training of the existing operating levermen. They should establish a
curriculum and schedule for the training classes to provide correct
training of new and existing employees of BIVTA in all phases of
hydraulic dredging. The courses must emphasize on-the-job training on
dredges and some theory in hydraulics to help them better understand
the principles of hydraulics and hydraulic dredging.
(c) Since the present operating levermen are semi-literate, the training
courses must be designed to present the information in a form that can
be easily understood by the key operating personnel presently employed
on the dredging equipment.

B. Aid to Navlgation
Introduction
9.       BIWTA is responsible for establishing, operating, developing,  and
maintaining the aids to navigation systems in all Bangladesh waterways, except
for the Ports of Chittagong and Mongla. The Conservancy and Pilotage Department
of BIWTA maintains the aids to navigation on all inland waterways with two buoy
tenders (one presently out of service) and through seven field offices, with a
collateral duty to mark the channel. This latter activity is accomplished by
contracting for the services of nonmechanized country boats and embarking markmen
from the field office to mark the contour of the channel with bamboo poles. In
order to improve and develop the aids to navigation system, GOB and BIWTA
undertook to implement the following Action Plan by June 1993.
Replace Acetylene Lights
10.            The aids to navigation system presently incorporates acetylene and
electric (solar powered) lights from five manufacturers in four different
countries.   This leads to confusion with installation, spare parts control,
inventories, and ordering of spare parts. In order to provide a more reliable
and manageable aids to navigation system, about 75 percent of lighting equipment
for minor lights (buoys and shore lights) will be converted to electric (solar
powered) lighting systems from one manufacturer.
Buoy Tenders
11.            The following rehabilitation and improvement will be completed:
(a) dry-dock and repair the buoy tender, Malancha;
(b) dry-dock and repair the buoy tender, Pathfinder, as required, and
replace its motor generator sets and distribution panels;
(c)  develop a vessel operating schedule for dockside maintenance and dry-
docking on regular basis and institute a diesel engine maintenance
program; and
(d) institute internal inspection programs for all buoy tenders, with
reports made to and corrections monitored by the Mechanical and Marine
Engineering Department.
Telecommunications
12.            Additional HF radio sets will be acquired immediately to enhance
the existing HF systems. Thirty HP transceiver sets along with other accessories
and spares should be purchased for BIWTA.

Distress Radlo Frequencies
13.            Monitoring of the international distress frequency should be
expanded to include three locations at Chittagong, Mongla and Dhaka, where they
can be monitored 24 hours a day.  The responsibility for monitoring shot-d be
transferred to the Inland Ship Safety Administration under the Department of
Shipping. Definitive procedures for reporting emergencies should be established
to ensure expeditious processing of emrgency messages.
Inventory Control System
14.            A computerized inventory control system for all aide-to-navigation
and telecommunications equipment, both in the field and on ships and in various
stores, will be established.
C. Nydrographic Survey Operation
Introduction
15.            The annual workload of the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport
Authority (BIWTA) Hydrographic Department cannot be accomplished at present in
view of constraints placed on it mainly as a result of equipment deficiencies.
Critical factors to be considered in the improvement of the hydrographic survey
operations are the transfer of survey vessel assignment to the Hydrographic
Department, and acquisition of additional vessels and modern survey equipment.
16.            The efficient utilization of hydrographic survey capability is
currently being hampered by a lack of suitable vessels. The survey vessels are
operated by the Conservancy and Pilotage Department and because of the shortage
of pilot boats, the survey vessels must be used in support of pilotage
activities. GOB agreed that survey boats be assigned to, and operated by, the
Iydrographic Department.
17.            Survey effort is severely hampered by lack of adequate vessel
positioning instrumentation.   The DECCA system now in use is obsolete, in
constant need of repair, and incapable of producing the accuracy required for
hydrographic surveys.
18.            Control of the survey operation should remain in Dhaka to
facilitate communication among the Hydrographic Department and other Government
agencies and members of the private sector who are users of the information
provided by the Department. Three branch survey o_fices of the Hydrographic
Department, reporting to the central office in Dhaka, should be established for
the South (Barisal), the Southwest (Khulna) and the Northeast (Ihairabazar) and
should each be assigned one acconuodation barge (see para 19).

Equiip.mt ImproweAmnts
19.            Operational improvement is dependent upon improvement in survey
instrumentation and vessels.   The DECCA system should be replaced by modern
survey instrumentation. Comprehensive operational and maintenance training must
be provided to realize the full potential of the equipment. In addition, the
survey fleet is inadequate to accomplish the responsibilities of the Hydrographic
Department.  The following recommendations will resolve these problems:
(a)  an improved electronic  positioning system should be provided  in
1992/1993 to replace the existing DECCA system which has deteriorated
to the point where its usefulness for navigation and hydrographic
survey purposes is negligible. The new system will not be tendered
until a study of alternative position fixing systems has been carried
out and an adequate number of Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellites have been placed in orbit and are operational so as to allow
at least 20 hours per day coverage of all parts of Bangladesh,
whichever occurs earlier;
(b)  the preponderance of the boats designated as hydrographic survey boats
were built in 1966 and are frequently down for repair. These boats
should be removed from the survey fleet;
Cc) the coastal survey vessel, Sandhani, should be thoroughly reconditioned
and assigned to the Hydrographic Department;
(d) in addition to the three Dutch survey launches currently under
construction, six smaller inland survey workboats (10 m length overall)
should be procured and assigned to the Hydrographic Department;
(e) three accommodation barges (20 m length overall) should be constructed
to provide quarters and office facilities for survey crews to preclude
excessive traveling time to remote work areas; and
(f) maintenance of the survey fleet should remain the responsibility of the
Mechanical and Marine Engineering Department. To prevtent unwarranted
down time, a scheduled maintenance plan for each boat should be
developed prior to end of 1991 by the Mechanical and Marine Engineering
Department, coordinated with the Hydrographic Department, and strictly
adhered to.
Technical specifications for the electronic position fixing system, hydrographic
survey workboats and accommodation barges are in the project file.
Projected Improvement Goals
20.            The average workload for B VTA, Hydrographic Department for the
last three years is used as baseline data for the projected improvement goals and

BANGLADESH
INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
BanglaJesh Inland Water Transport Corporation
BIlIC Strategic Plan
1.       BIWTC was created in 1972 through the amalgamation of 10 inland
vessel fleets which had been abandoned at the time of Bangladesh's liberation.
The mandate of BITWC has been to operate this government-owned fleet, no
specific strategic objective having been established. Mounting losses
incurred by BIWTC has resulted in GOB questioning both the rationale for
BIWTC, and the need for providing increasing subsidies to it. Over the years
BIWTC has, nevertheless, developed certain key public services which are not
provided by private vessel operators such as coastal passenger services to
offshore islands and the main ferry services. The corporation also par-
ticipates in other market segments where it is in direct competition with
private operators, and in these BIWTC seeks to moderate the market, and
provide the government with a minimum capability to transport essential
commodities in the event of emergencies.
2.       This strategic plan is based on various in depth analyses of the
BIWTC fleet and of private vessel fleets which provide -land water
transportation services in Bangladesh. Specific analyses which support this
strategic plan include:
(a) BIWTC Fleet Development and Rationalization Study--prepared by
consultants from the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K.
(b)   Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Master Plan, Chapter 6 (The Water
Transport Fleet) - prepared by DlV Consulting Engineers, the
Netherlands.
(c)   Cost-Benefit Effectiveness of BIVfC Fleet - prepared by the Institute
of Cost and Management Accountants, Bangladesh.
In addition, this strategic plan benefitted from numerous in-house analyses
carried out by the staff of BIWTC. The strategic objectives identified and
addressed in this plan are set out below.
A. Strategic Obiectives
3.       BIWTC's long-term objective will be to:
"Become a financially viable organization, and to concentrate
its activities in those sectors of inland water transport where
the Government needs to remain involved, i.e., the ferry
sector and the coastal passenger sector. The cargo sector in
which BIWTC now incurs a majority of its losses will be
gradually phased out."



-50-                   amex 5
Page 2 of 12
In support of the above long-term objective, the medium-term objective to be
accomplished during the Fourth Plan period (1991-1995) is stated as follows:
'For each distinct market segment in which BIWSC operates,
establish autonomous profit centres which seek to become
financially viable over the next three years, with the
exception of thi coastal passenger service where government is
required to provide non-economic (social) services, and for
this BIWTC should seek to achieve at a minimum a working ratio
of 1.0, i.e., its revenues including direct government
subsidies should cover operating costs."
The profit centres referred to above are identified as follows: Coastal
Passenger Services; Inland Passenger Services; Cargo Services (Bay Crossing
and Inland); Ferries; and Repair Yards. Profit centres which do not achieve
the above medium-term objective, will be divested by BIWTC in fiscal year
1994.
B. Perfornnce of Market Ses ats
4.       BIMTC operates the largest fleet of vessels in the inland water
transport sector. Out of a total of approximately 2,100 mechanized cargo
vessels with a load capacity of around 410,000 m.t., the BIWTC cargo fleet
accounts for around 400 vessels (of which only 160 are truly operational) and
these have a load capacity of around 75,500 m.t. In the passenger sector,
there are a total of around 1,450 mechanized passenger vessels with a total
capacity of around 155,000 passengers. BIWTC's passenger fleet accounts for
around 43 vessels with a capacity for around 8,300 passengers. Overall, the
BITC fleet represents, on a tonnage or capacity basis, around 20 percent of
the total fleet in the cargo sector and around S percent of the passenger
sector. The above do not however include BIWTC's ferry operations where BIWTC
and the Roads and Highways Department ferry fleets constitute a virtual public
sector monopoly. The following paragraphs discuss the situation in each of
BIVTC's major market segments:
(a) Coastal Passenmer Services
5.       These are primarily passenger services provided by the Government to
inhabitants of the offshore islands. Very little cargo is carried and a lack
of shore facilities on the islands precludes carriage of significant amounts
of cargo by the large mechanized vessels (smaller country boats provide cargo
services).  Two major routes on      a these services operate are: (a) Chit-
tagong-Hatiya-Sandwip-Barisal (Zl kn)t and (b) Chittagong-Uatiya (145 km).
On these two routes three very old vessels are used (A. Matin, A. Ahmed,
M. Haque) and on average these vessels suffer around 225 dayslyear off-hire
due to technical problems. In addition three other coastal vessels (Hatiya,
Nanpura, Bhola) provide services on lesser routes such as the Kumira-
Guptachara and Chittagong-Kutubdia routes. These vessels too are very old and
suffer from extremely low utilization and service on the routes operated by
these vessels tends to be extremely unreliable. Four nevwr vessels - Kajal,
Kutubdia, Rangabali and Moheshkhali - are nominally assigned to this service.
However, their high cost of operation prevents their use and they have largely
been out of operation. The coastal passenger service contributes about 4
percent to total revenue. The sector incurs continuous losses as shown in
Table 1.

Loss                  (13.6)  (9.0)  (15.7)  (16.6)  (15.9)
Revenue from this sector is not even adequate to cover direct operating costs,
and net losses have, in most cases, exceeded the revenue generated. Since
this is a socially justifiable sector with no private sector operations,
continued operation would be justifiable with direct subsidy from the
Government. Improvements in service performance is necessary and would
require replacement of the vessels currently being utilized on these routes.
New coastal passenger vessels should have a capacity of around 750 passengers
and 100 tons of cargo and the fleet should be able to provide daily service.
(b)   Inland Passenger Services
6.       Revenue from this sector reached a peak in 198586, and has dropped
considerably since then. In 1988, the sector contributed only 5.3 percent of
total revenue of BIVTC (see Table 2). As in the coastal passenger service,
revenue from this sector does not cover direct operating expenses, and losses
have doubled between 1984 and 1988.

7.       The Dhaka to Rhulna Rocket Service is the main inland passenger
service provided by BIVTC. Of the eight vessels used on the rocket service,
only Gasi and Tern appear to have a reasonable level of utilization.
Madhumati and S. Belayet were off-hire for over 300 days in the past year,
E#en Gazi and Tern had around 130 days off-hire. The other four vessels
(Kiwi, Lepcha, Mahsud and Emdadul) are hardly ever in service.



-52-                  Annex S
Page 4 of 12
8.       Analysis of the Rocket service indicates that six of the eight ves-
sels are candidates for scrapping. Re-engining of Gazi and Tern may be
considered. However, the condition of the hull for these vessels is so poor
that this may not be worthwhile. In view of the serious lack of capacity in
the inland passenger sector, and the very large number of accidents caused by
overloading of passenger vessels, the Government should consider replacing the
BIWTC fleet with 3 inland passenger vessels to operate on the main trunkroute
Dhaka-Barisal-Khulna. Financial viability on this route can be achieved by
(a) raising tariffs by 50 percent above current levels; and (b) improving the
operational performance of the vessels in this service.
(c) Day Crossing Carso Services
9.       The bay crossing cargo sector contributes about 42 percent to the
total revenue of BIWTC. This sector, which includes tankers for petroleum
products, coasters for bulk cargo, and bay crossing tug barges has the
potential for operating profitably, (see Table 3). This sector made marginal
profits in 1984 and 1985, and minor losses from 1986 to 1988. It was,
however, able to cover cash operating costs in these years (i.e., all costs
except depreciation). With some improvements in productivity levels (e.g.,
lower turnaround time) and operational efficiency (fuel efficiency), this
sector could make a reasonable surplus.

10.      Tankers.  Twelve tankers each of deadweight capacity 900-1,000 m.t.
make up the BIWTC tanker fleet. Primarily these vessels are used for carrying
petroleum products from Chittagong to points inland. The analysis indicates
that fleet productivity could be improved by a factor of 2 to 4 times current
levels. Presently, BITRC tankers spend 150 to 170 days per year (on average)
out of operation, and when in operation spend around 6 idle days per voyage
waiting for cargo or to unload cargo. With reasonable productivity, the work
of this fleet could be accomplished with just 7 tankers.
1!.      Coasters.  This is a potentially profitable sector for BIWTC.
Typic-lly, these 18 vessels carry bulk cargo from Chittagong to inland
destinations such as Dhaka.  The fleet appears to bave a ,-  sonable level of
productivity with the exception of around 7 vessels which have a high level of
days off hire (about twice that of the rest of the fleet). The analysis



-53-                  Anne: 5
Page S of 12
indicates that twelve of these vessels are currently profitable for BTWTC,
though their operational performance could be improved.  The remaining vessels
(Bagabati, Hisla, Kasalong, Kocha, Soraiya, Tazul Islam and C-1066) are to be
disposed off.
12.      Bay Crossing Tug-Barges.  Performance of this fleet of 35 barges and
6 tugs is extremely poor. Typically each barge makes 4 to 5 loaded trips per
year, whereas 12 loaded trips per annum would be the minimum acceptable level
of utilization. Each tug makes on the average only 13 round trips per year
compared with coasters which make on average 20 round trips per year. Four
tugs with, at the most, 16 barges should be adequate for the work of this
fleet. Therefore, it is recommended that two tugs (Sadaft and BT-238), and 19
bay-crossing barges be disposed of.
(d)   Inland Cargo Services
13.      Revenue from the inland cargo sector dropped from Tk 27.9 million in
1983184 to Tk 14.9 million in 1987/88, while total costs increased from Tk 63
million to Tk 83.0 million. Losses at the end of the year from this sector
were Tk 68.1 million, i.e., 89 percent of total BIVTC losses, although it
contributed only 5 percent of total revenue (see Table 4).

Profit/Loss           (35.1)  (46.0)  (66.3)  (54.6)  (68.1)
14.      Self Propelled Barges.  Eight self-propelled barges are operated by
BIWTC, and of these 3 are very new vessels (the Annataris built in 1984). The
older five vessels are of 1930 vintage or older. Presently, all of these
vessels suffer from extremely low productivity. On a typical voyage they
spend around 16 days waiting for loading/discharge to comence. In addition,
the typical older vessels spends 180 days per year out of operation
(corresponding figures for the Annataris is 65 days).   It is therefore
recommended that the five older vessels be disposed of.
15.      Inland Tug-Barges.  BZVTC's inland tug-barge operation is probably
the worst of all of the fleet segments. It is estimated that out of just
under 200 barges involved in this operation, only 90 are actually earning
revenues. Further, among the 90 odd revenue earning barges, performance is so
poor that it is estimated that the operationally best 16 barges could carry
all of the cargo now being carried. The following sumnarizes the operational
performance:



-54-Atx 
Annex 5
Page 6 of 12
- 16 best (newer) barges mke 6 to 7 tripslyear;
- 32 medium condition barges make 3 to 4 tripslyear;
- 45 older barges make 1 to 2 trips per year; and
- the remaining barges are idle.
Around 40 inland tugs are utilized by this fleet of barges, and it is es-
timated that a fleet of 10 tugs and 40 barges would be adequate to the current
needs, and hence should suffice to fulfill the Government's minimum
requirements.
(e) Ferry Services
16.      Ferries contribute 44 percent of the revenues of BIWTC (up from 34
percent in 1983/84, see Table 5), and of this the Aricha ferries (Aricha-
Nagarbari, Aricha-Daulatdia) alone account for over 90 percent of ferry
earnings. The other important ferry is the Bhuapur-Sirajganj ferry. In
general, the ferry operations generate a positive surplus. However, if
interest payments and depreciation are considered, the newer ferries are not
breaking even.

17.      The analysis indicates that the Dhaka class ferries suffer from high
fuel consumption and these 4 vessels may be disposed of. Also, the
performance of these vessels, Sitalakhya, Karnafully, Gorai and Gumti indicate
that they are candidates for scrapping. The strong demand in this sector and
difficulty in recovering full cost on the never ferries, suggest that the
Government may consider investment in additional ferries if this is
accompanied by a substantial increase in tariffs.
(f) Repair Yards
18.      BIVTC operates repair yards in Ihulna, Narayanganj, and Dhaka.
Although details of the operations of these repair yards are not known, they
are mostly in a state of disrepair, and do not provide adequate facilities for
rehabilitation of DITC's vessels. The current operation of the repair yards
is that they are treated as an overhead of vessel operations, whereby their
costs are allocated to the other sectors arbitrarily on the basis of the other
operating costs. There is, therefore, no financial statements on the
operations of the repair yards.



-55-                 Annex 5
Page 7 of 12
C.  Prosed Scrappin8 Progra
19.      The Government has embarked on a scrapping program which will
eliminate vessels in poor condition from the BIWTC fleet. In selecting the
vessels to be disposed off, the emphasis has been on the condition of the
vessel, rather than on its economic performance. It is estimated that around
160 vessels will be scrapped reducing the current fleet from over 400 vessels
to around 300 vessels. Since this vessel disposal program is determined
primarily by the condition of the vessels, the remaining fleet exhibits
certain imbalances and also may not be optimal from the view point of JIWTC
operational requirements. A further rationalization of the fleet (see below),
particularly the inland cargo fleet, will be called for in the near future.
This will aim at balancing the fleet and also gradually eliminating those
operations where BIWTC stands to lose money.
D. Financial Perforance of IWTC
(a)   Profitability
20.      The financial performance of BIWTC has been deteriorating steadily.
From a deficit (after interest and depreciation) of about 4.9 million Taka In
1983184, the deficit in 1987/88 stood at 56.6 million Taka. Further, if
interest charges on existing obligations had fully reflected interest due, the
deficit on 1987/88 would have exceeded 80 million Taka. At the end of FY88,
accumulated losses amounted to 218 million Taka. From draft unaudited
statements, it is expected that for the year 1988189, the deficit will more
than double to around 120 million Taka, thus increasing accumulated losses to
more than 330 million Taka. This sharp increase In the deficit is largely
attributed to increases in depreciation charges on newly acquired vessels and
increases in staff costs.
(b) Liquidity and Revenue Collection
21.      Although the current ratio seems favorable, BIWTC's liquidity
position is characterized by large amounts of outstanding accounts
receivables, some of which have been outstanding since 1977. As of June 1988,
outstanding receivables amounted to 171 million Taka. Table 6, which shows
the average collection period, demonstrates the seriousnes of the situation.
The average collection period would be higher if revenue from the cash market
segments, i.e., ferries , passenger services, is excluded from the analysis.
Out of the total receivablee in 1987/88, about 88 million Taka (or 51.3
percent) is owed by other public institutions and Government departments.
BIWTC's current liabilities are characterized by large amounts of accumulated
interest ((176.2 million Taka) payable on both government and foreign debt.
Payment of these amounts (including the debt itself) by BIWTC seems unlikely
with the current financial situation.

(c)  Capital Structure
22.      BIWTC's capital structure consists of Government grants, equity and
long-term debt. The ratio of long-term debt to total capital has been low,
due to a Government decision to convert some debt into equity in 1984185. The
size of long-term term debt, has, however, been accumulating over the years,
with little or no repayments made. In the current position, BMTC is unable
to take up any new debt to finance capital investments, unless the Government
intervenes. Any future investment will therefore require substantial
restructuring of the existing capital structure, involving rescheduling of
some portions of existing debt to enable BIWTC to undertake more investments.
U. Future linacial Perforuauce
23.      At its current level of operations, BIlST is likely to remain a drain
on Government resources, unless substantial improvements are made in its
financial structure, operations, and policy objectives. Further investments
in new equipment and/or vessels, without accompanying improvements will result
in increased losses, and insolvency in a matter of a few years as illustrated
by the analysis of two scenarios presented below.
Case Is Continue to operate BIWTC as at present. This analysis assumes that
BIVTC will continue to operate all cargo, passenger and ferry sectors. The
only new investments in this analysis are the ferries which are
already committed under a grant from DANIDA. The investment cost for these
ferries has been estimated at US$15 million (approximately Taka 657.0
million). Existing debt is assumed to be rescheduled over twenty years,
beginning from FY90. The analysis also assumes the implementation of the
scrapping program, which has already been agreed upon. Outstanding interest
payable Ls assumed to be converted into equity in 1989/90. The financial
projections for this scenario shows net losses increasing to Tk 169.2 million
by the end of financial year 1997/98, and cash losses accumulating to Tk 1.2
billion. BIVTC will be insolvent by 1995.
Case MIl Achieve better financial and operational performance through tariff
increases, cost reductions, fleet restructuring, surplus labour reductions,
and improved fuel efficiency. This analysis assumes that BIVTC will implement
tariff increases on the ferry and passenger sector, in two phases over a four



-57-               jawsko  5
Page 9 of 12
year period. These fare increases are justifiable since passenger fares have
not been adjusted since 1982. (Ferry tariffs were adjusted by 10 percent in
1988, despite a decision to increase them by 50 percent). This analysis
further assumes an investment of US$60 million (Tk 1.9 billion), over the next
five years. It should be noted that the investment of US$60 million is the
most that BIWTC could undertake with the proposed changes. Any investments
higher than this amount would increase BIWTC's debt service liability to
unmanageable proportions. BIWTC's existing debt is also rescheduled over
twenty years, and outstanding interest payable is converted into equity.   The
performance of BIWTC under this scenario shows profits beginning in 1993194,
and BIWTC being able to service both existing and future debt obligations.
F.  Strategic Plan
24.      To become financially viable over the next five years, BIWTC will
need to introduce important changes in its operations, finance, organization
and manpower. The following paragraphs set out key elements of the strategic
plan.
(a) Organizational Restructuring
25.      It is recommended that BIWTC establish five autonomous profit
centres, each of which is capable of operating independently. These will
consist of the profit centres referred to in previous sections, i.e., Coastal
Passenger Services; Inland Passenger Services; Cargo Services (both bay
crossing and inland); Ferry Services; and Repair Yards. Each of these will
have adequate staff to manage its operations, and will be expected to become
financially viable within three years. This restructuring will assist in
ensuring transparency within each profit centre's operations, and will avoid
unintended cross-subsidization. The repair yards are also expected to operate
as a profit centre, to which each of the others (and outside fleet operators)
may contract their repair work based on competitive bidding. This will
ensure that the others are not charged an arbitrary overhead cost for repairs,
regardless of whether they had repairs done or not. For coastal passenger
services where the government is required to provide non-economic services,
the direct subsidies will be needed at a level of about Taka 10 million per
annum at current prices. If financial viability is not achieved in certain
profit centres, these will be divested in FY94. Technical assistance under
the IWT III project will be provided to each of the profit centres in the form
of a team of Management Consultants for a period of 4 years. The Management
Consultants will be assisted by BIWTC counterpart personnel, who will be
trained to assume responsibility at the end of the management assistance
programme. These managers will assist in staffing, operations, financial
management, fleet development, and staff training.
(b) Financial Restructuring
26.      This will consist of a capital restructuring, a rationalization of
the magnitude of BIWTC's accounts receivables and improvement of its revenue
collection procedures.



-58-
Paso 10 of 12
27.      Cagital Restructuring.  As of June 1988, total outstanding debt owed
by BIVTC including outstanding interest amounted to 899.1 million Taka. It is
obvious that BUMTC is unable to repay the amount in its present condition. If
new investments are undertaken, chis debt service liability, including debt
service liability for the new investments, will put BIWTC into further
financial difficulties. It is therefore agreed that the Government approve
rescheduling bIWTC's existing debt over a period of 20 years, beginning from
1991/92 with an effective interest rate of 9 percent p.a., and converting
outstanding debt and interest payable to equity so as to adjust for any
difference in the interest rate established from the present weighted average
interest rate of 9 percent on existing debt. Coupled with other improvements
and changes, BIWTC should be able to service existing debt, and future debt of
about US$60 million.
28.      Accounts Receivables and Revenue Collections.  The collection of
outstanding accounts receivable is a major problem for BIWTC, which had
outstanding accounts receivables of Tk 197.9 million as of end 1988. BIWTC
does not have an internal mechanism to enforce collection from government
ministries and agencies (which make up about 50 percent of total accounts
receivables). For commercial arrears, there has been no effort on the part of
IWTC to develop a debt collection program of any kind.
29.      The central issue has been claims for shortages of cargo carried for
Government departments. More than half of BIWTC's accounts receivables
represent these claims, and clients have suspended payment, until the claims
are resolved. It is recommended that the concerned Government departments,
together with BIWTC, review the contracts under which the cargo is carried to
revise 6 v provisions that unfairly burdens either party.   A procedure should
also then be developed to collect debts due from other government departments.
For any debt that cannot be reconciled, BIWTC should write it off in FY92.
30.      For private sector commercial receivables, BIWTC should first set up
an effective program for prompt invoicing and collection of accounts
receivables, and also develop a written policy covering the basis for the
granting and repayment of credit, including terms of repayment, security, etc.
For existing debt, BIWTC should reconcile all outstanding accounts, and
resolve any discrepancies. Collection methods for these should include
rescheduling of some long outstanding receivables over an agreed fixed
payments schedule. BIWTC should also prohibit use of its facilities if the
agreed repayment schedule is not being followed, unless cash payment is
possible.
(c)   Fleet Restructuring and Rehabilitation
31.      As indicated earlier, with the exception of the ferry and passenger
sectors, BIWTC can carry ouL its present role with a substantially reduced
fleet of vessels. Table 7 sets out a fleet restructuring plan for the years
FY91-95. The proposed restructuring program reduces fleet size in line with
(productive) requirements in each market segment. Selected vessels from among
the vessels to be retained, will be designated for rehabilitation. The vessel
rehabilitation program will be allocated a total budget of US$3.5 million.
The Management Consultants appointed under the project will develop an optimal
fleet rehabilitation program within the limits imposed by the available
budget.

(d)  Monvoer Rationalization
32.      BIWTC's fleet restructuring programme outlined in the table above
will result in surplus manpower of about 2,200 people. 1,200 surplus staff
should be reassigned to duties in other organizations in the IfT sector.
Department of Shipping and BIWTA are understaffed and each could absorb about
600 surplus BIWTC personnel. About 1,000 of this surplus staff (those with
less than 5 years remaining service) will be given the option of early
retirement with full benefits over a period of 5 years. It is proposed that
the cash (about Tk 100 million) will result in a cost saving of about 30
percent on the total wage costs of BIWTC.

(e)   Coastal Services Subu.LdI
33.      The cost of public service obligation is estimated at Tk 10 million
(para 25 above) will be given by GOB to BIWTC as payment for providing coastal
services, starting in 7Y91192. In subsequent years, the amount would be
adjusted to reflect inflation and any changes in the level of service
provided.
(f)   Facilities ImPovemnt
34.      To improve operational efficiency of the various profit centres
miscellaneous equipment will have to be procured, and improvements made to
existing facilities of BIWTC; this would include fuel monitoring systems,
telecommunications equipment (30 HP transceivers), vehicle recovery cranes for
ferry operations and cargo weighing scales. There is also a need to improve
BIWTC's office facilities, and these would be included in the proposed
project. The total budget for facilities development would be US$2.8 million
equivalent and the Management Consultants appointed under the project would
develop a list of facilities development needs that fits within this budget.
(g)   Tariffs
35.      A tariff increase of 70 percent on the ferries and 50 percent in the
passenger sector, implemented in stages over the period FY91 to FY95 with an
initial increase of 45 percent in the ferry sector and 25 percent in the
passenger sector, except deck class passengers where the increase would be 10
percent, to be implemented by March 1991. BIMTC will be allowed to compete
freely with private operators in the cargo sector.

THIRD INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Institutional Development Action Plan.
1.       Institutional development actions recommended here are based on the
recommendations of four reports produced in preparation for this project.
(a) Bangladesh - Third Inland Water Transport Project, Analysis of Waterway
Institutions; Water Resources Congress, Arlington, Virginia, May 1989.
(b) Bangladesh - Third Inland Water Transport Project, Report of the
Special Task Group on Organization Planning; Water Resources Congress,
Arlington, Virginia, December 1989.
(c) Bangladesh - Third Inland Water Transport Project, Report of the
Special Task Group on Training; Water Resources Congress, Arlington,
Virginia, December 1989.
(d) ILO mission report on "Training Component for the Third Inland Water
Transport Project," by J.Z. Fikus (ILO, Geneva) and 0. Schouten (ILO,
Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok), November 1989.
The above reports are available in the project files. Recommended actions and
programs are also based on detailed reviews by IDA missions and on discussions
with the Government on institutional development needs and possibilities.
2.       The Ministry of Shipping (OS) of GOB is responsible for all Government
functions  in  the  inland water  transport  sector.    It  discharges  these
responsibilities through three agencies, namely, the Bangladesh Inland Water
Transport Authority (BIWTA), Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation
(BIWTC), and the Department of Shipping (DOS). The first two are autonomous
entities which are expected to be 3elf-financing.   BIWTA is responsible for
maintaining all waterway infrastructure including channels, inland ports avad
other public facilities.  BIWTC operates a fleet of vessels providing ferry
services, inland and coastal cargo services, and inland and coastal passenger
services. DOS is responsible for most of the regulatory and training functions,
though in some areas, its mandate appears to overlap with that of BIWTA.
A. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority
3.       BIWTA's board consists of a Chairman, effectively the chief executive,
and five other Board members, including the Members of Engineering and Finance
Departments who are full time members. The Board is appointed by the Government,
(through the Ministry of Shipping) and is responsible for approval of staff
appointments,  salaries,  development and revenue budgets.   The Ministry of
Shipping's involvement in BIWTA's daily operations and the concentration of
decision making at the highest levels of management are impediments to efficient



-62-
AnneX 6
Pag 2 of 7
operation.    The  BIWTA  chairman  also heads  an  advisory  committee whose
responsibilities include advising users of the waterways (both private and
public) on all matters relating to the development, maintenance and operation of
inland water transport in Bangladesh in particular, dredging activities.
4.       BIWTA's organization structure consists of eleven departments of which
the operational departments are: (a) Ports and Traffic, (b) Marine Engineering,
(c) Conservancy and Pilotage and (d) Hydrography Department. These departments
are responsible for waterways maintenance, conservancy, shoreside facilities
development, dredging and controlling the activities of public and private sector
vessel operators. The others are support departments, including Administrative,
Accounting and Finance, and the Secretariat.
5.       As of January 31, 1990, BIWTA had a sanctioned staff of 3,978 of which
approximately 3,125 positions were  filled.   Out of the total sanctioned
positions, 3,367 were in the operational departments, while the remaining were
in Finance, the Secretariat and the Dock Personnel Training Center. Like other
public agencies in Bangladesh, the organization structure of BIWTA was set up by
the Enam Committee, which was commissioned to assess the staffing levels of
public agencies. BIWTA feels that although the sanctioned staff levels seem
adequate, there are serious staff shortages in some areas, especially in the
Conservancy and Pilotage (C & P) Department. With the increase in waterway
traffic over the years, and with the deterioration of ehannel conditions, the C
& P Department is overwhelmed and needs additional people. There is also lack
of management skills at all levels in most departments, especially in planning,
finance and accounting departments.   Therefore, BIWTA manpower needs to be
increased, particularly in the C & P Department. There is also a need to improve
managerial and technical skills of senior staff through appropriate training
programs.
Inatitutional Weaknesses
6.       Institutional weaknesses identified in the current BIWTA organization
are as follows:
(a) Responsibility for dredging operations is fragmented among the Chief
Engineer, the Chief Mechanical and Marine Engineer, and Conservancy and
Pilotage Department. This results in an inadequacy in the chain of
command and leads to operational inefficiencies.
(b) Tariff making authority of BIWTA is weak, and enforcement capability is
practically non-existent.
(c) Directorate of Conservancy and Pilotage is understaffed and therefore
finding difficulty in meeting its obligations; out of a total
sanctioned strength of 1,583, the Directorate is short 230 staff.
(d) Planning Directorate similarly is very understaffed and needs to double
in size from 33 staff to around 65 staff.
(e) Design approval for inland vessels is presently carried out by the
staff of the Chief Mechanical and Marine Enjineer, and it is felt this
responsibility would be better fulfilled by the Department of Shipping



-63-
Amnix 6
Pap 3 of 7
which is responsible for inspections, certification and registration of
vessels.
(f) The Barisal Workshops of BIWTA are barely operational and all of the
staff there are likely to become redundant.
(g) The Deck Personnel Training Centre which is presently under BIWTA could
be better integrated into the Government's overall training apparatus
if this too were placed under the Department of Shipping.
Based on the above observations, an action plan has been developed, and this is
set out in the following paragraph.
BIWAT Institutional Development Action Plan
7.       GO. will undertake the following actions with respect to BIWTA:
(a) Establish a Dredging Unit reporting to the Hember Engineering -
dredging staff presently assigned to the Chief Engineer, Chief
Mechanical and Marine Engineer, and to the Conservancy and Pilotage
Department, should be transferred to this unit;
(b) Terminate all activities relating to the setting of cargo tariffs for
IVT. Cargo tariffs will be deregulated by the Ministry of Shipping.
(c) Absorb at least 600 staff from BIWTC to mate up the overall shortfall
of staff from sanctioned strength and to reduce the surplus presently
existing in BIWTC (see para 12 below)--of these, 230 staff are to be
assigned to the Directorate of Conservancy and Pilotage,  and an
additional 30 staff are to be assigned to the Directorate of Planning
(the latter should be recruited from BIWTC's Comuercial Department),
any conflict with regard to specific staff will be resolved by the
Secretary, MOS, or his designate;
(d) Transfer the Barisal Workshops to BIWTC where it will become a part of
BIWTC's ship repair profit centre;
(e) Transfer all inland vessel design approval responsibilities together
with associated staff resources to the Department of Shipping, upon the
establishment of the new 'Inland Ship Safety Administration;,
(f) BIWTA will appoint a member for planning and operations to its Board of
Directors; and
(g) Transfer the Deck Personnel Training Centre to DOS.
All of the above actions are to be completed prior to the mid-term review of the
project which would be carried out by June 1993.

B. Bangladesh Inland Water Tranport Corporation
8.       The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) was created
under Presidential order No. 28 of March 1972, mainly to take over the operations
of inland water transport services in Bangladesh, after the war with Pakistan.
At the time, there were about 10 private sector inland water transport
corporations, abandoned by Pakistani and foreign owners, which were nationalized
by the Government of Bangladesh.  BIWTC thus became responsible for a wide
variety of water transport operations ranging from cargo tanker services, inland
tug and barge operations, passenger services on inland waterways and between
mainland ports and offshore islands; and ferry services across major inland
waterways. Details of BIWTC operations are in Annex 5.
9.       BIWTC has four major departments reporting to the Chairman, each headed
by a director.   These departments are, namely:   Finance; Administration;
Maintenance and Operations; and Commerce, Sales and Services.  The existing
organization is not well structured and should be streamlined and rationalized,
particularly in the Maintenance and Operations Department, and the Commerce,
Sales and Service Department, where responsibilities overlap. As an example,
operational staff are under the Maintenance and Operation Department while fleet
scheduling is controlled by Commerce Sales and Services Department. As a result,
day to day operations require tie joint authvirtw.ation of both departments, which
causes delays, loss of running time and other operating problems. In addition,
the lines of responsibility in the Directorate of Commerce, Sales and Services
for zone managers are ambiguous, as they have to report to separate headquarters
managers. It is also common to find zone managers responsible for a full mix of
services, e.g., ferry, inland cargo, passenger services, which clouds
responsibility, and reduces accountability.. These issues are being addressed
under the project through the organizational restructurinb of the Strategic Plan,
with the formation of profit centers for ,ach service.
10.      As of March 1989, total sanctioned staff of BIWTC was 7,792 while the
posted strength was 5,932. The distribution of these staff among the various
departments was as followst Administration - 240; Finance - 393, Maintenance and
Operations - 6,484 and Commerce Sales and Services - 675. This staff level was
proposed by a committee sanctioned by GOB to assess the minimum staffing needs
of all public corporations. Discussions with BIWTC management indicate that the
staffing level and structure do not reflect its staff needs, and that generally
BIWTC is overstaffed.   In addition, the quality of planning/budgeting, and
accounting staff (with a few exceptions) is poor, and need strengthening. BTWTC
does not have a formal training program. Training has usually been funded on an
ad hoc basis by bilateral technical assistance. Under the proposed project, a
staff retrenchment program will be implemented involving the redeployment of some
staff to other institutions in the IUT sector [see para 12 (b)].
Institutional Weaknesses
11.      Institutional weaknesses identified in the current BIWTC organization
are:
(J, Whereas certain parts of the organization are profitable, others incur
large losses and the current structure does not permit adequate
transparency in the performance of these various subsidiary units; and



-65-
Annex 6
Page 8 of 7
(b) Fleet rationalization envisaged in the BIWTC Strategic Plan (Annex 5)
will result in very large redundancies in staff and BIWTC will need to
find ways to reduce its overall strength from around 5,930 at present
to around 3,730 in 1995, f.e., a reduction of around 2,200 staff.
Based on the above, and in support of the Strategic Plan (Annex 5), a number of
actions are recommended and these are detailed in the following paragraph.
BIVTC - Institutional Dfvelownt Action Plan
12.      GOB will undertake the following actions with respect to BIWTC:
(a)  Appoint a management consultant to reorganize the corporation,  in
accordance with the BIWTC Strategic Plan, into five profit centres--
coastal passenger services, inland passenger services,  coastal and
inland cargo services, ferry services and repair yards, BIWTC assets
and staff, including commercial staff, will be distributed among these
profit centers;
(b) The BIWTC Management Consultants (BMC) will develop, within six months
of appointment, a BIWTC manpower rationalization plan which they will
then implement. The plan will include the following clementa:
-   Give option of early retirement with benefits to all staff, who
have less than 5 years of service remaining (approximately 1,000
staff)--the compeasation is to be funded from the proceeds of
vessels sold for scrap;
- BIWTA will be allowed to recruit 600 staff from the remaining BIWTC
staff;
- DOS will be allowed to recruit 600 BIWTC staff; and
(c) BIWTC will takeover the Barisal workshops of BIWTA as part of its ship
repair profit center.
All of the above actions are to be completed prior to the mid-term review of the
project which will be carried out by June 1993.
C. Department of ShiPPinp
13.      DOS came into existence in the year 1976 as a department of the Ministry
of Shipping. Its mandate in relation to inland water transport, as distinct from
oceangoing/merchant shipping, is summarized as follows:
(a) Administration of the Inland Shipping Ordinance (ISO), 1976 and rules
thereunder, includings
(i)     registration and survey of ships and issue of certificate of

courts.
(b) Regulation of routes and cargo in respect of private sector ships; and
(c)  Implementation of Maritime Zone's Act and Rules thereunder.
In addition, DOS is charged with a number of minor functions, in some of which
its mandate overlaps that of BIWTA. DOS is a relatively young organization and
has yet to develop the institutional capabilities needed to fulfil its role.
DOS Instituti.sI. Develojseut Action Plan
14.      DOS needs to significantly expand its activities to bring about
improvements in the regulatory framework and related enforcement mechanisms in
the IWT sector. The following actions are to be undertakens
(a)  Establish an Inland Ship Safety Administration as set out in paragraphs
20 to 24 below--this entity should be staffed with personnel selected
from BrITC's existing staff;
(b) Take over the Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre from BIWTA; and
(c) Initiate a study and other actions on environmental controls for IV? as
set out in Annex 7.
All of the above actions are to be completed prior to the mid-term review of the
project which will be carried out by June 1993.
15.      The Inland Shio Safety Administration (ISSA) will be headed by a
Director, Inland Ship Safety Administration. The Director, ISSA, will report
directly to the Director General of Shipping, DOS. The ISSA will be mandated to
perform the following functions:
(a)  Enforce  safety  regulations with  respect to operations of  inland
vessels;
(b)  approve the design and construction of inland vessels, issue safety
construction certificates, and carry out periodic inspection of vessels
and renew safety certificates in accordance with the provi.ions of
applicable regulations; and
(c)  protect thie inland waterways from environmental degradation caused by
the development or operations of inland water transport.



Annex 6
Page 7 of 7
16.      DOS will recruit about 600 surplus staff from BIVTC to fulfill its
responsibilities under para 20 (a) above. These staff will be deployed at rural
launch stations and inland ports. They will be responsible for reporting cases
of overloading to the Director, ISSA for action by DG Shipping through the Marine
Court. In support of this activity, DOS will establish a total of five marine
courts located at Dhaka, Chittagong, Barisal, Khulna and Narayanganj, and DOS
will appoint at least six special officers for ,arine safety. Six 16-foot speed
boats will be procured for ISSA.
17.      All inland vessel design approval responsibility will be transferred
from BIWTA to ISSA together with any personnel employed in BIHTA solely for this
purpose. DOS will also be authorized to employ 20 additional vessel inspectors
and 8 surveyors to perform the functions set out in paragraph 20 (b).
18.      ISSA will be the executing agency for the environmental actions under
this project (see Annex 7).
Deck Personnel Trainung Centre
19.      Under the Credit, equipment will be procured to upgrade the facilities
of the Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre (DPTC), work will be undertaken to
enhance the curriculum and teaching methods, and steps will be taken to address
the issues in the inland water transport sector now affecting employment of
trained personnel of the centre.   Details of equipment to be procured and
technical assistance to be provided for upgrading DPTC were discussed with
Government and are available in the project file (Annex 19, Item 15). All of the
above would be carried out in agreement between GOB and the Association.

THIRD INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJDCT
Environmuetal Actions
1.       Environmental actions to be undertaken in the project are designed to
improve the capacity of the Government to minimize the environmental impacts of
inland water transport (IWT) on Bangladesh's waterways. They are comprised of
three activitiest
(a)  Environmental  mapping  of  the  waterways  to  identify  sensitive
resourceslactivities that may be affected by IWT development or
operations;
(b) Establishment of facilities for the testing of dredge materials in
order to ensure their safe disposal; and
(c) Assistance in the design of implementing regulations for the protection
of inland waterways from impact of ITW development or operations.
This component is to be executed by the Department of Shipping of the Ministry
of Shipping.
Environmental MaPPig
2.       The   environmental   mapping   will   identify   the   following
resourceslactivJities along and upon the waterwayss
(a) Major fisheries and fish spawning areas;
(b) Industries which may cause pollution of bottom sediments;
(c) Major sewer discharges from urban areas;
(d) Major points of inland water transport activities such as ports,
pontoons, oil loading or discharge terminals, industrial terminals and
storage facilities for fertilizer or other hazardous cargo; and
(e) Major population centers located along the waterways.
A Geographic Information System will be used to store data on all of the above
in a computerized data base.
Dredge Materials Testing
3.       A fully equipped laboratory for chemical testing of dredge materials
i111 be established. Personnel will be trained in the use of the laboratory
equipment. Procedures will be established for testing of bottom sediments prior
to commencement of dredging operations.   Laboratory staff will approve the
proposed disposal method for dredge materials based on the results of the testing
carried out.

Regulations for Environmental Protection of Inland Waterways
4.       Consultants will review the provisions of the Environmental Pollution
Control Act, the Marine Pollution Ordinance and the Inland Shipping Ordinance.
Based on the provisions of these pieces of legislation, the consultants will
3view the regulatory framework established in Bangladesh for protection of the
inland waters from impacts of waterway development and water transport
operations.  Consultants will recommend necessary regulations and associated
implementation mechanisms to cover any deficiencies identified in the existing
regulatory framework. In particular, the consultants will examine the need for
controls over discharges from inland vessels, and the feasibility of establishing
facilities for the reception of vessel wastes.   The consultants should also
examine the adequacy of emergency response plans (and capacity) of the Government
to respond to incidents involving hazardous materials transported on the
waterways.

THIRD ILAD WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Extension Facilities for the Country Joat Sector
1.       Country boats in Bangladesh perform almost as well and sometimes better
than the "modern mechanized inland fleet, and considering their very significant
role in the rural areas of Bangladesh, the Government wishes to encourage their
increased participation in inland water transport. Presently, there are around
20,000 larger country boats (above 5.5 tons capacity) engaged in cargo transport,
and around 160,000 smaller boats used for passenger and cargo transport. At
least 10 percent of this fleet is now mechanized with the productivity (ton-km
output) enhancements from mechanization ranging from a factor of 2 to 2.5.
Whereas, transport cost savings from mechanization are not very substantial, from
the viewpoint of the waterway system, mechanized vessels increase safety due to
their improved maneuverability, speed and reduction in overall numbers, and for
this reason, it is the Government's stated policy to encourage mechanization and
modernization in this sector. The Government's strategy will include a number
of measures including providing infrastructure and facilitates for technical
extension services to encourage incorporation of minimal safety features such as
running lights on mechanized boats, and adoption of appropriate fuel saving
technologies such as sail-assist mechanization.
Eztension Services
2.       Presently, the Government has no capacity for extending assistance to
the country boat sector. Under the project, it is envisaged that BIWTA will
establish facilities at various locations in order to service the needs of rural
country boat operators. Areas in which BIWTA would provide extension services
includes
(a) technical assistance in the selection of appropriate mechanization
technology and incorporation of safety features, and in the maintenance
of boat engines and propulsion systems;
(b) technical assistance in the securing of credit to finance now boats or
for mechanization of existing craft; and
(c) technical assistance for the establishment of boat owners'
associations.
The Boat Owners' Associations established by BIWTA, would advise Government
agencies such as BIWTA and DOS on issues that affect the development of the
country boat sector.
Iacilities to be Developed
3.       Under the project, BIUTA would build and staff 10 Country Boat Extension
Facilities at appropriate locations in areas where there are a significant
concentration-of country boats. The facilities would be equipped as follow:s



-71-
Pape 2 of I
(a)  one building measuring approximately 100 sq m;
(b) three demonstration boats fitted with engines and propulsion systems;
(c) 100 sets of propulsion systems available for lease to members of the
country boat association; and
(d)  miscellaneous   equipment   as  needed   for  demonstration/training
activities.
Each facility will be funded from the proceeds of the credit with US$150,000
equivalent to be used for any of items (a) through (d) above. The credit funds
will not be used for acquiring land.
Iaaaamant of the Facility
4.       BIWTA will designate one officer from its staff to manage each facility.
Additional staff may be recruited by the Country Boat Association from its own
resources which would include members dues and surpluses generated from the lease
of equipment. Leasing rates will be based on interest rates of coaercial banks,
and will be set at levels adequate to cover the cost of operating the extension
facility and of replacing the leased equipment.

DANSLADESH
THIRD INLAND WATR TRANSPORT PROJWCT
Tern of Reference for Project Des   nd Coordination Consultant
A. Introduction
1.        The 1988 flood demonstrated the critical importance of the inland
water transport (IW) system as part of Bangladesh's regular transport network
and its emergency infrastructure. The ITW system has, however, been accorded a
much lower priority than other transport modes in spite of the fact that it
carries over a third of total freight movements and around 20 percent of
passenger movements. The Government is now rethinking its strategy in light of
experience during the flood.when IWT proved to be the only reliable means of
delivering emergency assistance. More generally, the IWT represents a valuable
transport asset, the utilization of which has been less than optimal due to: (a)
inadequate development and maintenance of navigation channels; (b) inefficiencies
in the operations of inland fleets; and (c) inadequacies in the training and
planning capacity of institutions responsible for development of IV?. Probably,
one of the most critical areas of IWT requiring attention is safety on the
waterways. Over the last 10 years, there has been numerous passenger vessel
accidents resulting in loss of lives numbering in the thousands. A Master Plan
for the IWT sector has been finalized with Dutch technical assistance.   In
addition, the International Development Association (IDA) has been executing a
number of studies funded under the U.S. Trade and Devel pment Program in 1989 on
vessel safety, dredging, navigation aids, hydrographic surveys, training and
institutional development.
D. The Project
Project Objectives
2.        By financing core investments for the IWT sector, the project would
seek to ensure that the Government can address the essential elements of its
development strategy.  The objectives of this development strategy ares  (a)
improving waterway safety and environmental controls; (b) increasing inland
passenger transport capacity; (c) improving capital asset utilization; (d)
reducing inland water freight transport costs; (e) improving country boat
operations; (f) improving the finances of BIWTA and BIWTC; and (g) improving
institutional capacity for planning, policy formulation and training of inland
vessel operators.
Project Description
3.        The various components of the project have been grouped into five
parts, as follows:



-76-
Amex 12
Pga 2 of 12
Part A: Dredging (BIWTA - US$3.0 million)
4.        Selected waterways would be deepened as needed to ensure that 1.8
meters of water are available at all seasons.   Dredging works totalling 10
million ue would be carried out by force account at a rate of 2 million telyear
using BIWTA's dredges as followst (a) 2 million mn at the Ajmiriganj section of
the Meghna-Kushiyara River; (b) 1.3 million m  at the Baulai section of the
Kangsa Rirer; (c) 1.7 million ms in the Titas River; and (d) 5 million m8 fc-
rehabilitation of certain patches of Class I and Class II waterways,. including,
access to Baghabari Port. The project would finance part of the cost of dredging
operations  based  on  fuel  and repair expenses.    IDA has  considered  the
international aspects of this component, in particular, dredging on the Meghna
River. Although this is an international waterway, the works proposed under this
project would not adversely affect the quantity and quality of water flows to any
riparian countries. Similarly, the works would not be adversely affected by the
use of water that riparian countries might make.
Part B: Aids to Navigation (BIWTA - US$6.8 million)
5.        Aids to navigation on about 1,200 km of Class I and Class II waterways
will be upgraded to secure day and night navigation by rehabilitating existing
equipment and providing new floating and shore lights, buoys, beacons, etc., as
well as replacement of about 75 percent of acetylene powered   pghts with solar
powered lights. This would mainly involve procurement and iustail.tion of about
400 shore lights, S0 lighted buoys and 100 unlighted buoys. Waterways to be
upgraded are:  (a) all Class I and Class II waterways; (b) proposed Class II
waterway from Bhairabazar to Chattak; (c) waterway approaches to Mongla and
Chittagong seaports; and (d) Aricha-Daulatwia-Nagarbari, Bhuapur-Sirajganj, and
Mawa ferry routes.
Part C: Inland Pontoon Facilities (BIWTA - US$7.5 million)
6.        Presently, there are about 1,400 landing stations at which launches
handle passengers and cargo.   Of these, only about 230 have pontoons to
facilitate passenger and cargo movements. An additional l00 pontoons, including
five spare pontoons to replace those being maintained or repaired, and their
access bridges would be provided under the project at selected locations
conforming to the pontoon location criteria agreed with Government.
Part D: Equipment (US$19.1 million)
7.        The project includes numerous smaller components as followss   (a)
procurement of equipment 'or rehabilitation of 5 BIWTA 18-inch cutter suction
dredgers including fuel monitoring systems; (b) procurement of spare parts and
floating support equipment for BIWTA's dredgers; (c) purchase and installation
of equipment to upgrade BIWTA and BIWTC's High Frequency (HF) telecommunication
system and establishment of distress frequency monitoring at Dhaka, Mongla and
Chittagong; (d) purchase of inland survey work boats and accormodation barges for
"Class I Waterway" means a waterway with a minimum navigable depth of
12 feet; and "Class II Waterway" means a waterway with a minimum
navigable depth of 6 feet.

BIWTA survey crews; (e) procurement and installation of an electronic position
fixing system to replace BIWTA's existing Decca system; (f) rehabilitation of
selected BIWTC vessels within the overall parameters established for the BIVWC
fleet in the Strategic Plan; (g) procurement of miscellaneous equipment and
facilities for BIWTC including fuel moni*oring systems; (h) purchase of 6 speed
boats to DOS for safety patrols; (i) pur%.hase of equipment for strengthening the
DOS Inland Deck Personnel Training Center; (j) purchase of equipment for DOS for
environmental control; and (k) purchase of equipment and facilities for country
boat owners associations to be established by BIWTA.
Part E: Technical Assistance (US$6.5 million)
8.        The following technical assistance components would also be financed
under the project: (a) implementation of BIWTA Operations Improvement Action
Plan; (b) management consultancy to implement the agreed BIWTC Strategic Plan;
(c) project design and coordination support for the Project Monitoring Unit of
MOS; (d) establishment of Inland Ship Safety Administration within DOS; (e)
preparation for DOS of an environmental mapping of the waterways and development
of implementing regulations for environmental protection of inland waterways; and
(f) assistance to DOS to develop the Inland Deck Personnel Training Center.
Total work months of technical assistance required is estimated at about 410.

minimum, the remaining staff are to be tdentifitd In a surplus staff
pool assigned to the parent corporation. Present BDIMC Headquarters
staff will be reassigned to each of the profit centers, and the



-88-
Annex 13
Page 2 of 4
Headquarters of the parent BIWTC will be assigned no more than 100 of
these staff whose funetion will include coordination of the activities
of the five profit centers. The consultants will assist in developing
and managing an early retirement scheme whereby the proceeds of the
vessel disposal program are utilized for early retirement of staff
with less than five years of remaining service, and will assist in
negotiating a reasonable severance package for those taking early
retirement.  In addition, the consultants will help coordinate the
transfer of approximately 600 staff, to BIUTA and 600 staff to the
Department of Shipping.
(d)  Organizing   and  Assisting   in   Implementation   of   the   Fleet
Rationalization Program
In accordance with the strategic plan, the conaultants will assist
BIWTC management in progressively disposing of vessels to reach a
fleet size of under 150 vessels by June 1995. These vessel disposals
will be accomplished via a combination of sales to private vessel
operatots or scrapping. Sales to private operators could include a
financing plan whereby BITWC agrees to finance private operators who
would acquire the vessels upon payment of a minimum down payment which
is above the scrap value of the asset.
(e)  Preparing and Assisting in Implementation of Tariff Adjustments
The consultants will advise BIWTC management on the optimum structure
and level of tariffs, so as to progressively achieve at a minimum the
tariff increases (over September 1989 tariffs) agreed between the
Government and IDA for the Fourth Plan period (i.e., by June 1995).
These agreed tariff increases are based on BIWTC's cost structure as
at September 1989, and any significant changes in the input prices
(for labor, fuel, etc.) should be adjusted for.  In designing the
tariff, the objective will be to make each profit center competitive
and in general financially viable; in the case of coastal passenger
services, the tariff established would also consider the direct
subsidy provided by GOB for this social service.
(f) Coordinating Fourth Five Year Plan Investments
It is estimated that BIWTC will undertake investments worth
approximately US$60 million over the Fourth Plan period.   These
investments would be financed by varlous bilateral and multilateral
agencies, and are expected to include investments ins  two Ro/Ro
ferries, three inland passeniger vessels, two coastal passenger
vessels, and miscellaneous capital expenditures for rehabilitation of
existing vessels, procurement of miscellaneous equipment and spares,
and implementation of improved telecommunications systems and fuel
consumption monitoring systems. The consultants shall assist BIWTC
management  in  coordinating  the  smooth  implementation  of  these
investments, and in providing technical advice on the selection of
appropriate equipment and vessels.
In addition to the above ongoing responsibilities, the management consultants
shall, at the end of 18 months from their appointment, prepare a report on each
of the 5 profit centers. The report will assess future prospects for each profit

center, and will recommend a strategy for the future disposition of that profit
center (either retention by BIWTC, or divestment of its assets, or
privatization), and will prepare a plan of action for implementing the
recommended strategy. Upon approval by BIWTC of a recommended strategy, the MC
shall assist BIWTC in implementing the strategy over the remaining term of their
contract.
D. Responsibilities of the 6overgmnut
4.        BIWTC,  will make available  for the sole use of the Management
Consultant and their personnel adequate office space (including furniture and all
operation and maintenance services for these olfices). BIWTC will not provide
housing for the consultants personnel or their families; these should be arranged
and paid for by the consultants.
5.        BIWTC will provide, from the conmencement of work, all available
relevant information and data, and will assign the following three technical
counterparts to the Management Consultantes
(a)  Planning  officer  competent  in all  aspects  of BIW'C commercial
operations and planning systems, including manpower and fleet
planning;
(b) Engineer/Naval Architect officer competent ir. all aspects of BUTC
fleet maintenance and operations; and
(c) Financial officer competent in all aspects of BIWTC financial
operations.
The above counterpart technical staff will work closely with the management
consultants on a day-to-day basis and should be officers with the requisite
authority to make decisions in their respective areas of competence.
Exemption of Taxes, Duties, Etc.
6.        The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) undertakes to exempt the MC from
or bear the costs of any taxes, duties, fees, levies or other impositions imposed
under its laws and regulations, nationally or locally, on the MC and their
personnel who are not citizens of Bangladesh, for payuents such personnel may
have to make in connection with the execution of their services including:
(a) income earned in Bangladesh for work on the project;
(b) equipment, materials, books and supplies brought by the MC into
Bangladesh for the purposes of execution of work on the project and
which, at the termination of the services on the project shall be
taken out of the country; and
(c) personal property brought into Bangladesh and which will be
repatriated upon the departure of such personnel.

THIRD INLAUND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Bangladesh Inland WVter Transport AuthorLty
Fiuancial Perfotmance
1.       BIWTA operates as a semi-autonomous organization under the Ministry of
Shipping, and is 100 percent owned by the Government. As of June 30, 1989, its
net worth, which consists of Government equity, foreign grants and various
reserves was Tk 1,013.2 million.  The audited accounts of BIWTA are shown in
Tables 1 to 3 of this annex for the financial years ending June 30, 1984 to 1988.
^.       BIWTA's income and expenditure accounts for the years 1984 to 1988 are
shown in Table 1. Revenue performance has been erratic over the five years, with
an increase between 1984 and 1985 (352), followed by a significant drop in 1986,
after which it stagnated, only to increase by 28 percent in 1988, to 1985 levels.
The increase in revenue in 1988 is attributed to recovery in port and dredging
revenue, which increased by 49 percent and 88 percent, respectively, after the
drop in 1986 and 1987. As a result (also due to increased government grant
allocation in 1988), the annual net loss dropped from Tk 48.3 million in 1987 to
Tk 5.3 million in 1988.  BIWTA's expenses increased faster than revenue between
1984 and 1986.  however, the significant growth in revenue between 1986 and 1988
reversed this trend, so that over the five year period, the average growth in
revenue matched the growth in expenses. Most of the increase in expenses were
from staff costs and related expenses. The annual loss was however, understated
during the period. BIWTA had ignored debt servicing, and the GOB had not made
any efforts to enforce interest (and principal repayment) from BIWTA.   If
interest is estimated on the basis of existing standard loan terms, annual
interest charges would be around Tk 40 million instead of Tk 2.1 million for
1988. The situation is complicated further by GOB's practice of withholding
annual development budget allocations to BIWTA (and other public agencies)
apparently to offset outstanding interest and debt obligations from the agencies.
The financial statements therefore cannot reflect a true picture of BIWTA's
financial position. Such practices encourage debt service defaults, and affect
the implementation of the annual development program investments.
3.       BIWTA's Revenues and Collection: The major sources of revenue for BIWTA
consist of (a) port charges; (b) conservancy fees; (c) pilotage fees; 'd) canal
charges; and (e) dredging charges.   Port charges consist mainly of berthing
charges for veesels, landing and shipping charges on goods, terminal charges,
lease and license of launch stations, etc. Conservancy fees are charges realized
by BIWTA for providing inland water services such as aids to navigation, river
training works, etc. Conservancy fees are assessed annually on the basis of
estimated vessel capacity and are payable in quarterly installments. Pilotage
fees are charged for pilotage services provided to vessel owners, while canal
charges are charged to vessel owners for the maintenance and upkeep of the
canals. Dredging charges, on the basis of which BIWTA receives an allocation
from the Government, are fixed on the basis of BIWTA's cost of dredging, and
sometimes include a mark up. Usually, BIWTA's cost of dredging is based on
volumes of dredging estimated for the following year. Ti se tolls and charges



-96-
Annex 16
Page 2 of 10
have not been revised for a number of years, and currently do not reflect the
unit cost of providing these services. An immediate tariff increase is therefore
necessary, followed by periodic reviews and revisions to enable BIWTA generate
sufficient revenue to cover operating, maintenance and administrative costs of
providing the revenue generatung services. Under the propoeed project, IDA will
seek an initial tariff increase of 30 percent on all operations, which would be
a condition of Board presentation. Table 4 of this annex shows the existing and
proposed tariff charges on some of BIWTA's servi4es.
4.       Revenue collection has been poor and BIWTA's procedures for collection
are unsatisfactory. Port charges, like berthing, terminal and other fees are
supposed to be collected in cash at the terminal. However, BIWTA allows certain
public agencies and some private operators, credit terms, and payment is always
delayed or ignored altogether. This also applies to conservancy charges, which
are supposed to be paid quarterly. BIWTA has no policy to enforce payment from
these operators and arrears have been accumulating. At June 30, 1988, accounts
receivables were Tk 124.3 million (63 percent of revenue).  Recently, BIWTA
established measures to reduce the level of arrears, which include a cash coupon
system for pilotage fees, and a requirement that vessel operators should clear
any outstanding arrears to BIWTA before they can have their vessels inspected.
This is expected to improve revenue collection substantially, and will result in
a significant reduction in arrears. Under the proposed project, these measures
will be enhanced and BIWTA will be required to reduce the level of arrears to
about three months of revenue.
S.       BIWTA's balance sheets for the financial years ended June 30, 1984 to
1988 are shown in Table 3. The balance sheet shows a modest growth in assets,
of about 5 percent between 1984 and 1988.  These assets have been primarily
financed by a combination of Government and foreign loans and grants. Some of
the loans have been converted into equity; and the debt to equity ratio is
satisfactory. This is because the annual development budget allocations by GOB
for development programs are in this case, treated as additions to equity.
However, the level of long-term debt (which, at June 30, 1989 was Tk 883.8
million), is cause for concern, if BIWTA is to repay its existing debt and
undertake new debt. BIWTA has not made any effort to service any of the loans.
IDA will seek agreement with GOB and BIWTA to reschedule existing debt over a
period of 20 years, beginning in the Fourth Five-Year Plan (FY91), at 9 percent
rate. This requirement will be a condition of the Board presentation of the
proposed project.
6.       BIWTA's excessive current ratio does not reflect the correct liquidity
situation. This is because BIWTA has accumulated stocks of inventory, some of
which are now obsolete, or unusable. Discussions with BITWA officials indicated
that the company does not have a policy for the maintenance of adequate stocks
and spares, and has not carried out a physical verification of the stocks
available, so that the values in the balance sheet do not necessarily reflect the
actual value of the stocks. As part of the financial recovery action plan, BIVTA
will revalue its stocks'of inventories, and sell off all obsolete and nonusable
stocks by PY93. In addition, BIWTA's accounts receivable include some amounts
that have been outstanding for several years, and recovery is now unlikely.
About 50 percent of these are owed by other public agencies or government
departments. This problem prevails in most public agencies in Bangladesh, and
requires a coordinated effort by the Ministry of Finance to offset the

receivables of one agency against another agency's payables.   As discussed
earlier (para 4), BIWTA will be required to reduce the level of arrears through
writing off uncollectible arrears by enhancement of collection methods, with the
objective of reducing accounts receivables to about three months of revenue by
FY93.
A.  Accounting and Control
7.       BIWTA's accounting system and control procedures are generally poor.
Some of the deficiencies include noncompliance with accounting standards, delays
in updating of monthly accounts and completion of annual accounts, and poor
receivables, inventory and fixed asset accounting. In 1982, an accounting and
finance review of BIWTA was conducted with IDA assistance to provide TWTA with
appropriate accounting procedures, manuals, and the organizational changes
required for an improved commercial accounting system. However, progress in
implementation of the recomuanded changes has been limited and deficiencies and
weaknesscos still exist. The review also developed an internal audit manual on
the basis of a revised accounting system, which, does not seem to be followed.
8.       The auditors have constantly spelled out the deficiencies in the notes
to the audit statements. Some of the most common are:
(a)  that  the  balance  sheet  is  drawn  each  year  without  physical
verifications of fixed assets, stores and spares; as a result, the
balance sheet does not present a true picture of the financial position
of BIWTA:
(b) the accounts are not maintained consistently every year;
(c) some transactions in the accounts lack supporting documents or records;
(d) the accounts receivable are not prepared on the basis of the ageing of
the accounts and are classified into general subsectors; as a result,
it is impossible to ascertain and follow up individual arrears for
collection.
9.       Discussions with BIVTA have indicated that the recommendations of the
accounting and finance review were not fully implemented because of lack of
senior skilled and trained staff in the accounting department, due to a
Government freeze on recruitment in public agencies. At present, BIWTA is making
efforts at implementing accounting reforms, and under the proposed project, GOB
will agree to the employment of more staff, with the implementation of the
Operational Improvement Action Plan.
B. Budgeting wad Audits
10.      As is required for all public agencies, BIWTA must submit an annual
budget to GOB for its approval. The budget includes the revenue and expenditure
estimates based on the operations of BIWTA in the first six months of the current
year.  Due to the lack of a well trained planning staff and an improved data
base, the budgeting procedure does not provide management with the financial



-98-
Amnex If
Page 4 of 10
management criteria to judge its performance and take corrective action,, which
has contributed to its past inability to achieve satisfactory operating and
financial performance.
11.      As required by the Government, BIWTA's accounts are audited annually by
a team of external chartered accountants. Delays in the completion of accounts
have always affected the timeliness of the audit and sometimes the audit reports
are issued over a year after the end of the financial year. The audit reports
contain adequate detail and notes on the accounts, have always pointed out
general deficiencies of BIWTA's accounting system.
C. Financial Recovery Action Plan
12.      As part of a program to improve its performance, BIVTA is committed to
undertake a series of measures to reverse the deteriorating trend of the past few
years. These measures have the backing of GOB, and some of them have already
been implemented, e.g., the coupon system for pilotage services, and the
requirement that vessel operators should pay arrears before their annual vessel
inspections. It is clear that these actions will have a positive impact on
BIWTA's revenues, and a sustained effort is required to introduce long-lasting
efforts.  To summarize, BIWTA will implement the following actions in a ianner
satisfactory to IDA and review its financial projections with IDA annuallyt
(a) revise tariffs by 30 percent on all operati us initially, and
thereafter annually review its tariff structure and implement increases
to ensure that revenue from operations progressively covers full cost
of operation and maintenance including debt services and depreciation
by 1995, after taking into account Government budget allocations for
nonrevenue earning operations;
(b) review budget allocations for nonrevenue earning operations (dredging
and hydrographic survey) and agree amounts consistent with work plans;
(c) implement an action plan to write off uncollectible arrears, and
measures to improve revenue collection and reduce the level of its
accounts receivables to about four months of revenue by the end of
FY93;
(d) to crrry out a valuation of all stock and spares by end of FY92, and
sell off or otherwise dispose all obsolete, damaged and mismatched
stocks by end of FY93;
(e) create separate accounts for revenue and nonrevenue earning activities,
have its accounts audited by independent auditors i.e., professional
chartered accounting firm, in accordance with Article 4.01 (b) (i) of
the Development Credit Agreement; and to furnish copies of the audited
statements (to consist of balance sheet, income statements, sources and
uses of funds statements) as soon as available, but not later than six
months of the end of each fiscal year; and

(f) GOB will reschedule oututanding long-term debt over a period of 20
years beginning in FY90191 with interest payable at an interest rate
not exceeding 11.5 percent, and converting outstanding debt and
interest payable to equity so as to adjust for any difference in the
interest rate established from the present weighted average interest
rate of 9 percent rate on existing debt.
D. Flnancial Projections
13.      Based on the implementation of the above Financial Recovery Action Plan,
projections  have  been prepared  for BIWTA's  finantial  performance.    The
assumptions used in making the projections are summarized below, and the
projections are presented in Tables I to 3.
K. AesUptilons for Financ.ol Projections
14.      Revenuest   Increases in Government grants are assumed to reflect
increased operations for dredging, aids to navigation, and hydrographic survey.
The estimates were provided by VRC consultants, who assisted in preparation of
the project. Port traffic is assumed to increase by 8 percent p.a., while C &
P, Canal, and other revenue is expected to increase by 7 percent, 7.5 percent and
5 percent,  respectively.   This is based on the historical growth of the
respective revenue sources.
15.      Tariffss  It is assumed that BIWTA will implement a tariff increase of
about 30 percent on all revenue sources in the FY91, and thereafter from time to
time, to initially cover full costs of revenue earning operations, and eventually
to partly cover nonrevenue earning operations.
16.      Working Expenses reflect increased operatioAal activity for dredging.
hydrographic survey and aids-to-navigation. The figures are based on estimates
provided by WRC consultants.
17.      Salaries and wages are assumed to increase by 10 percent annually except
in FY91, when they increase by 24 percent and 21 percent, respectively. This is
to reflect the employment of 600 more staff as outlined in BIWMA institutional
action plan.
18.      Administration expenses are assumed to escalate by 10 percent.
19.      Depreciation is on a straight line basis with rates ranging from 5
percent to 20 percent for different groups of assets. This approximates to about
4 percent of average gross fixed assets in operations.
20.      Interest charges are based on interest rates of 9 percent p.*. for
existing debt, which is assumed to be rescheduled over 20 years, and 11.5 percent
p.a. for new debt.



-100-
Annex 16
Paoe 6 of 10
Balance Sheet
21.      Gross fixed assets and work-in-progress are based on historical costs.
It is assumed that 60 percent of additions to fixed assets are added to work-in-
progress, and the rest is added to gross fixed assets.
22.      Development assets are develo:% .t dredging work, which is treated as
a non-depreciable asset.
23.      Accounts payables are assumed to be reduced from 6 months of revenue to
about three months of revenue by FY93.
24.      Stocks and inventories are assumed to be 12 percent of gross fixed
assets in operations.
25.      Prepayments and advances and other receivables are assumed to increase
by 5 percent.
26.      Foreign Loans from FY91 onwards represent new debt.  It is assumed that
all existing foreign and government loans will be rescheduled and BTWTA W. be
responsible to GOB for debt service. As a result, all existing debt is shown in
the projections as government debt.
27.      Accounts receivables are assumed to be 2 1/2 months of non-cash expenses
(e.g., fuels and oils, operating supplies, etc.)
28.      Other liabilities are assumed to increase by 15 percent.
Sources and Application of Funds
29.      BIWTA's capital investment costs are based on project estimates to be
undertaken during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, and incorporate the bank's
escalation factors for foreign and local components.
30.      Debt service obligations reflect BTWTA's obligations to meet principal
repayments on both existing and future debt. Existing debt is assumed to be
rescheduled over 20 years beginning FY91.

Financial Performance
1.       BIWTC was set up with an authorized share capital of Tk 450 million.
The original issued share capital included the Government's contribution of Tk
9.9 million to the East Pakistan Shipping Corporation, which preceded BIWC. The
Government of Bangladesh is the only shareholder of BITC. As of June 1989,
share capital amounted to Tk 412.3 million, which represents the original issued
share capital, and capitalized annual development programse allocations to BIWTC
to finance its capital investment programmes. Equity capital was increased in
1984 through a conversion of Tk 179.3 million of government loans into equity.

2.       Table 1 shows audited income and expenditure accounts of BIWTC from 1984
to 1988.  The financial statements show that BIWTC's operating results have
deteriorated over the period. Total revenues declined between 1985 and 1987 due
to a decline in freight traffic and although they increased in 1988, they had
still not recovered to 1985 levels. Over the five year period, the average
annual growth in total revenue was about 2 percent. Cargo revenues over the five
year period declined continuously, while ferry revenues increased significantly.
Total expenditures over the same period increased by 27 percent (an average
annual growth of about 7 percent) and the net deficit increased from Tk 4.9
million in 1984 to Tk 53.1 million in 1988, and accumulated losses amounted to
Tk 213.4 million. BIWTC's interest expenses shown in the income statements do
not reflect actual interest due on its debt, so that the deficit is understated.
As an example, in 1988, interest charged was only 3 percent of its outstanding
debt; average interest rate charged on similar debt in Bangladesh is between 9
percent-11.5 percent. Based on standard repayment terms on government debt, and
actual amounts of government loans outstanding, the resulting net loss would be
as follows:
1984      1985      1986       1987      1988
Operating Hargin                  0.5       1.2      (31.7)    (46.7)    (43.9)
Interest                         32.1      32.8       33.2      33.5      34.1
Deficit                         (27.1)    (31.6)    (64.9)    (80.2)    (77.2)

Annex 17

Iv addition, the interest expense shown in the income statement is only a book
entry, and actual payments are not made so that interest (and principal) payments
for foreign loans are made by GOB when and as they bec    due.  The Government
has agreed to reschedule this debt and capitalize the cstanding interest.
3.       BIVTC's structure of expenses, indicates that direct fleet expenses are
on average 77 percent of t .^ expenses.  Of the direct fleet expenses, about 30
percent constitute operLor,a. staff costs.  Together with other salaries and
staff expenses, total at '. :ofts for BIWTC constitute over 35 percent of total
working expenses, which ise t-gh by normal standards.
4.       On a sectoral basis, BIWTC's cargo sector contributes to over 90 percent
of BIWTC's losses.   These losses are partly offset by profito in the ferry
sector. The passenger sector also makes losses. The operating losses in the
passenger services include losses incurred in the operation of uneconomic routes
to the offshore islands. Losses in the passenger sector are also a result of low
tariffs, and high operating and maintenance costs due to the age of the fleet.
Profitability in this sector could therefore improve if passenger and ferry
tariffs were enhanced, if the passenger fleet was streamlined, adequate subsidies
were given for operation of t-he uneconomic routes, and if efficiency of
operations was improved. Subsidies in the cargo/freight operation, on the other
hand, are not justifiable due to low capacity utilization arising from
competition from the private sector. As part of the strategic plan for BIWTC,
agreement will be reached to streamline the cargo sector operations to the
minimum (see Annex 5) and revisions of all tariffs will be sought under the
project.
5.       BIWTC's balance sheets for the yeaps 1984 to 1988 are attached at
Table 3. The balance sheets show that BrWTC's assets increased in nominal terms
from Tk 1,339 million in 1984 to Tk 2,013 million in 1988 (an increase of about
50 percent).   These assets have not been revalued in a long time, and the
balances in the statements may not reflect actual replacement values. Equity
capital and reserves increased by about 103 percent over the five year period.
This huge increase is due to two reasones  (a) GOB converted some debt into
equity in 1985, (b) BIWTC borrowed from the Government in 1988 to finance two
ferries, and this amount has not been added to existing debt, but instead has
been added to reserves, apparently in anticipation of a further conversion of
debt into equity. BIWTC's long term debt to equity ratio is low, partly due to
the conversion of Government loans into equity in 1984/85 which was designed to
reduce BIWTC's total indebtedness and improve the capital structure.
Rescheduling of the existing debt will still be required under the proposed
financial recovery program, to enable BIWTC to take more investments on a loan
basis.
6.       BIVTC's liquidity situation has deteriorated considerably, with the
current ratio dropping from 2.01:1 in 1984 to 1.57 in 1988. The actual liquidity
maybe worse for two reasons: First, the accounts receivable, which average about
12 percent of total net assets (considered high by normal stand&rds), contain
substantial receivables that have been outstanding for a long time (in some cases
over ten years old), with very little hope of recovery. Second, the stores and
inventories also contain some stocks of goods that are obsolete and therefore
have no usable or resale value. Some of these stock4 were taken over from the
nationalized companies in 1972, and their actual value is not known. Discussions



-107-
Amnex 17
Pago 3 of 10
with BIWTC officials indicate that actual usable storeo and spares as of June
1988 were about 50 percent of the value indicated in the accounts. Under the
Financial Recovery Action Plan, these matters are being addressed by BIWTC
through enhanced arrear recoveries, and revaluation of the inventories.
7.       BIWTC' s current liabilities include accumulated interest payable on both
Government and foreign loans, most of which has been outstanding for a long time.
As of June 30, 1988, this amount stood at Tk 176.2 million and constituted 24
percent of outstanding loans. In addition, local and foreign debts hove been
outstanding for a long time with no repayment; as at June 30, 1988, the total
outstanding debt was Tk 708.7 million. Correction of this situation is the
responsibility of GOB as well as BIWTC, since lack of enforcement procedures by
GOB has led to accumulation of this debt. BIWTC's management claim that there
has been no onlending agreement with GOB on the repayment of foreign debt, and
that some of the debts are actually grants. Under the proposed project, IDA will
reach agreement with GOB to have the outstanding debt rescheduled over 20 years,
beginning in FY 1991, at 9 percent interest rate. This lower interest rate, (the
existing rate is 11.5 percent) is to reflect an averaging with the lower interest
rates of earlier loans. IDA will also require an agreement with BIVTC and GOB
to convert the outstanding interest into equity.
B. Accounting and Control
8.       BIVTC's finance department consists of the accounting and internal audit
divisions, and is headed by the Member Finance.   The Finance department is
responsible for the preparation of: (a) accounting records; (b) bills and
invoices; (c) operational or revenue budgets for submission to the Ministry of
Finance; and (d) annual financial statements. The- Member Finance, who reports
to the Chairman of BIWTC, has limited autonomy to formulate and implement
financial decisions.
9.       BIWTC's accounting system is weak.  Its shortcomings includes (a) poor
record keeping, which include lack of a complete fixed assets record; (b) lack
of control over accounts receivable; and (c) delays in the preparation and
submission of financial statements for audits. As a result, BIWTC's accounts do
not consistently yield a clear timely picture of its financial situation. Like
most public entities in Bangladesh, BIWTC has insufficient trained accounting and
financial staff. This is further exacerbated by lack of coordination between the
accounting and operations departments, which impedes the timely preparation of
meaningful accounts, budgets and development plans. During the negotiations of
IDA Credit 735-BD (Second Inland Water Transport Project), it was agreed that to
improve BIWTC's financial structure and operations, a review of its accounting
procedures and systems should be conducted, to identify its deficiencies and come
up with appropriate recommendations. The study was to provide BIWTC with an
effective accounting system and operating procedures, on the job training for its
accounting staff, and to define appropriate methods of firnscing its activities.
Among other recommendations, the consultants prepared an accounting manual for
BIWTC's accounting unit. Implementation of the recommendations has been slow and
unsatisfactory, and many of the shortcomings identified in the study still exist.



-108-
Annes 17
Page 4 of 10
These accounting deficiencies are in the area of revenue and accounts receivable
accounting debt service liability, fized asset register maintenance, and account
reconciliation.
10.      As part  of a financial  recovery program and the organizational
restructuring in the Strategic Plan to be implemented by management consultants,
BIWTC will conduct a full review of all these outstanding issues to ensure that
proper values are attached to all the assets, liabilities, and stocks, design a
policy actien to recover outstanding amounts, and a system to avoid future
accumulation of receivables, improve control of accounting activities, and
provide more training to accounting and financial staff.
C. Budget and Audits
11.     BRIWTC is required to submit annually a budget to GOB for approval, which
forms the financial plan for the following year.   This budget includes the
revenue and recurrent expenditure estimates and capital expenditure estimates.
The budgets are prepared on the basis of actual results of the first six months
of the current year, and projected for the whole year.   Lack of appropriate
timely information for financial decision making affects the quality of the
annual budget, in that it does not reflect expected medium term changes in
operating conditions. Also, the planning process needs to be improved to cover
a five year period, based on realistic medium term traffic levels, and financial
forecasts, to provide a basis for managerial decision making. Budgetary control
is also poor, and actual expenditures are usually substantially higher than
budgeted figures.
12.      BIWTC maintains an internal audit division, comprising twenty-five staff
members who conduct financial and management audits. The effectiveness of this
unit is, however, not satisfactory, since reporting procedures are not clear,
accounting policies and standards are not enforced and systems of budgetary
control are not in place. Currently, the audit division reports to the Member
Finance. This structure needs to be changed to have the internal audit division
report directly to the chairman to ensure that it operates with complete
autonomy. BIWTC's accounts are audited by two firms of chartered accountants,
who issue a joint audit report. The audit report is acceptable and contains
detail and supporting information on the financial statements. However, despite
the fact that some of BIWTC's accounting units have been computerized, the audit
reports are always delayed.
D. Financial Recovery Action Plan
13.      BIWTC's financial performance needs improvement, and this will require
the implementation of measures, which when taken together form a Financial
Recovery Action Plan. Transforming BIWTC into a commercially viable corporation
will require a commitment and concerted effort of all parties involved over the
next five year plan. IDA bas been asked to support this effort, and the proposed
project represents the first step towards this effort, and have assisted BIWTC
in preparing the Strategic Plan, and the actions which form the Financial
Recovery Action Plan. Actions under the latter would includes



-109-
Amez 17
Page 5 of 10
(a) improved revenue collection by raising ferry tariffs and passenger
tariffs annually to generate sufficient funds to cover its cash
operating and maintenance expenses, including debt service charges, and
contribute no less than 10 percent towards annual capital expenditure
by FY95;
(b) reduce operating costs by reduction on staff levels, and implementation
of a fuel monitoring system by FY93;
(c) reduce accounts receivables to about three months of revenue by the end
of FY93 by implementing a plan to write off uncollectible arrears, and
improve collection efforts;
(d) revalue and verify all existing stocks and spares on a basis
satisfactory to IDA by end FY92, and sell off or otherwise dispose all
obsolete, damaged or mismatched stocks by end FY93;
Ce) not to incur any new long-term debt unless the debt service payments on
current at1d new debt is covered 1.2 times by cash generated by BIWTC's
operations, including only direct Government payments for the coastal-
passenger services;
(f) the Internal Audit Department will report directly to the Chairman;
(g) BIWTC accounts will be audited by indepent auditors, i.e., professional
chartered accounting firm, in accordance with Article 4.01 (b) ti) of
the Development Credit Agreement, copies of audit statements (to
consist of balance sheets, income statements, sources and uses of funds
statements) will be furnished to IDA as soon as available, but not
later than nine months of the end of each fiscal year; and
vi) GOB will reschedule outstanding long-term debt over a period of 20
years beginning in FY90/91 with interest payable at an interest rate
not exceeding 11.5 percent, and converting outstanding debt and
interest payable to equity so as to adjust for any difference in the
interest rate established from the present weighted average interest
rate of 9 percent rate on existing debt.
S. Financial ProJections
14.      Based on the implementation of the above Financial Recovery Action Plan,
projections  have  been  prepared  for  BIWTC's  financial  performance.    The
assumptions used in making the projections are summarized below, and the
projections are presented in Tables 1 to 3.
F. a.ssumptions for Financial Projections
15.      General:  The financial projections are in constan- 1989 terms, and an
exchange rate (and relative price) stability is assumed.  The exchange rate
assumed is Tk 34.22 - US$1.00. Only the main financial statements (lncome and
Expenditure, Sources and Uses of Funds, and Balance Sheet) are presented.



-110-
A=ex 17
a8ge 6 of 10
Additional tables are available in the project file, and they provide details of
assumptions regarding operational expenses, tariffs and revenue, etc. The main
assumptions are explained below.
16.      Revenues:  The revenues are based on actual operating results for 1989,
and are projected using estimates of traffic growth, based on historical
experience. It is assumed that traffic growth i. the ferry sector operations
will be 8 percent p.a., until 1995/96 when th.s growth drops to 6 percent (due
to the diversion of some traffic to the Jamuna Bridge).   Passenger sector
operations are expected to grow at 3 percent p.a., and no increase is expected
in the cargo sector operations. It is further assumed that BIWTC will implement
tariff enhancements of about 15 percent in the ferry sector in 1989/90 (from the
ferry tariff regrouping) and 25 percent in the passenger sector. Thereafter,
BIWTC will revise tariff periodically to achieve a positive rate of return on
assets by the end of FY 1995.
Operating Costs
17.      Fuel and oil expenses are assumed to increase by 8 percent, except in
FY91 and FY92, when the fuel monitoring system is to be implemented, resulting
in a reduced fuel expense.
18.      Direct salary expenses are assumed to decline by 35 percent between 1991
and 1995, due to the implementation of the staff retrenchement program, after
which they increase by 10 percent annually.
19.      Repairs and maintenance costs are assumed to increase by 10 percent in
FY91, and then 20 percent in FY92 and FY93, and 10 percent thereafter. The
higher increase in PY92 and FY93 recognizes the fact that in the past, repairs
and maintenance has been understated.   Other salaries have been assumed to
increase by 10 percent annually.
20.      Administration and overheads have been assumed to increase by 5 percent
annually.
21.      Depreciation:   This is calculated on a straight line basis, with
different depreciation rates for different groups of assets. on average, this
approximates to about 4 percent of the value of gross fixed assets.   This
percentage has been maintained in these projections.
22.      Interest Charges:  The interest rate on existing debt (which is to be
rescheduled over twenty years), has been assumed to be 9 percent p.a., to reflect
an averaging of lower interest rates on earlier loans, and the existing rates on
more recent loans. Interest rate on new loans is assumed to be 11.5 percent
which is the current GOB lending rate to public organizations.
Balance Sheet Projections
23.      Gross fixed assets and work-in-progress are based on the historical
costs, and it is assumed that 30 percent of new additions to assets are added to
work-in-progress, while 70 percent is included as gross fixed Rssets.
24.      Investments are assumed to increase by 10 pe;cent



-111-
Annez 17
P5se 7 of 10
25.      Accounts receivables are assumed to decrease from 6 months of revenue
to about three months of revenue by FY93. Inventories are assumed to be 7.5
percent of average gross fixed assets in operation.
26.      Interest payable on loans is assumed to be converted into equity
in 199i..
27.      Accounts payable are assumed to escalate by 7.5 percent.
Sources and Applications of Funds
28.      BIWTC's capital investment costs for the period include investments for
the projects, and other investments under the Fourth Five-Year Plan, which have
been agreed under the BIWTC Strategic Plan. Further capital investments shown
in the projections, beyond the five year plan period are estimates.
29.      Debt-service obligations reflect obligations for both existing and new
debt. All new debt is assumed to be payable over twenty years, with five years
of grace. Existing debt is rescheduled over twenty years, with no grace period.

BARGLADESU
THIRD INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJCCT
Sconomic Evaluation
1.       The economic evaluation presented here covers the major components of
the project for which the benefits are quantifiable. They comprise investments
in navigational improvements, dredging improvements and rural launch pontoons,
i.e., approximately US$38 million (including price and physical contingencies)
out of total project costs of US$54 million. Major components for which economic
evaluation is not carried out are:   telecommunications improvements (US$1.4
million); electronic position fixing system (US$4.1 million); rehabilitation and
miscellaneous equipment for BIWTC vessels (US$7.7 million); technical assistance
and equipment for the Inland Deck Personnel Training Centre (US$4.1 million);
establishment for facilities of country boat owners association (US$1.5 million);
and some of the technical assistance components (totalling US$4.1 million) for
program management, environmental controls, safety administration, and management
assistance for BIVTC.
A. ITH Passenger and Freight Traffic
2.       IWT traffic flows tend to be concentrated in the southwestern and
northeastern parts of Bangladesh where the availability of land transport modes
tend to be more difficult. Estimates of the present volumes of road, rail and
IWT traffic over the main transport network are shown in the map attached (IBRD
Map No. 22359).   These flows are estimated using the Bangladesh Transport
Modelling System (BTMS) which has been calibrated using recent data for modal
split. Future traffic on the network has been projected using variouaE -roWth
rates based on historical experience and anticipated development along specific
routes. In general, freight volumes are expected to grow at 3 percent per annum,
while passenger traffic is expected to grow at 4 percent per annum. However, on
specific routes, where davelopment potential is high, the growth rates have been
increased to 5 percent per annum; these routes are Dhik, to Chattak in the
northeast, and Chittagong to Cox's Bazaar in the southeast. The Dbaka to Chattak
route serves an area which is not well connected to Dhaka by road and rail
transport, and is also the -oute upon which the country relies for its main
domestic supply of stone for construction. Chittagong to Cox's Bazaar presently
has relatively little traffic and the expectation is that this part of the
country will experience faster growth in the future.
B. ProJect Economic Costs
3.       Financial cost estimates have been converted to economic costs by shadow
pricing, and by excluding price contingencies, taxes and duties. Conversion
factors used for shadow pricing various cost categories are as followis (a) for
labor, the conversion factors used are 0.70 for unskilled labor and 0.89 for
skilled labor; (b) for diesel fuel, the conversion factor used is 0.85; and (c)
for all other costs, the standard c6nversion factor, estimated in other Bank
studies, of 0.80 has been used. Table 1 presents the calculation of economic
costs for each of the major components of the project. The followiug sections
present the economic evaluations for each of the major components of the project.

C. Aids to Navigation Component
4.       Navigational improvements are to be implemented on five IWT routes. All
of these are either Class I, Class II, or Coastal routes (see map IBRD 22007).
The routes ares (a) Dhaka to Chittagong (Class I); (b) Dhaka to Khulna (Class
I); (c) Dhaka to Chattak (Class II); (d) Dhaka to Baghabari (Class TI)s and (e)
Chittagong to Cox's Bazaar (Coastal). On each route, the project would upgrade
the aids-to-navigation system to ensure full day and night navigation.
Altogether these routes comprise a total waterway network of upproximately 1,200
km., and of these the project would improve navigation on approximately 725
route-km. Total freight tratfic on these routes is approximately 3.8 million
tons per annum with an average lead of approximately 200 km. Passenger traffic
on these routes totals approximately 2 billion pass-km -er annum. Details of the
input parameters for each route are provided in Table 2.
Without the ProJect
5.       Quantifiable  improvements  resulting  from  the  aids-to-navigation
component of the project are reductions in the vessel voyage times through higher
speeds en route, as well as through reduction in sailing delays resulting from
a lower reliance on pilots. Average voyage times for each route and sailing
delays have been estimated and are presented in Table 2;
With the Project
6.       Based on the increased speeds en route, reductions in the voyage time
are estimated and these range from reductions of 10 percent on most routes to 33
percent for routes which now have little night navigation capability. Sailing
delays due to pilot availability is assumed. to be reduced (Dhaka-Chattak) from
around 6 hours on average to around 5 hours. These are conservative estimates,
due to the unreliability of available data, and in fact it is expected that
voyage times will in general improve much more than suggested by the above
numbers.
EconomLc Evaluation and Risks
7.       Benefits resulting from the navigational improvements are presented in
Table 3.   These benefits stem entirely from vessel operating cost savings
resulting from reductions in the voyage days on each route. The savings are
based on average vessel operating costs per day on each route, and these depend
on the type of vessel (passenger or cargo) and the average vessel size. The
vessel operating costs range from Taka 3,000 per day for the smaller passenger
vessels carrying 150 passengers, to Taka 5,000 per day fvr the larger cargo
vessels carrying 750 tons on the Class I routes.Y
8.       It is assumed that the project is implemented over a 3-year period with
benefits on two routes beginning in the second year, on another two routes in the
third year and on the last route in the fourth year. Maintenance costs per annum
are assumed to be 12 percent of the investment costs.  The Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) is estimated to be around 31.7 percent, with a net present value

Consultants, November 1988.

(NPV) at a 12 percent discount rate of Taka 315 million. Sensitivity analyses
carried out with a 15 percent increase in cost, a 15 percent reduction in
benefits and a one year delay in benefits combined re3ulted in an ER of 16.5
percent and a NPV of Taka 88.7 milWon.  Details of the evaluations carried out
are presented in Table 4.
D. Dre4dins Works and Uquip ent
9.       The dredging component of the project includes both equipment to improve
the efficiency of dredging as well as dredging of critical waterway routes to
improve the least available depth (LAD). Dredging equipment to be procured under
the project include dredge tenders, derricks, survey workboats with accommodation
barges, dredge instrumentation and other miscellaneous equipment to improve
dredging efficiency. Dredging works include development dredging of about 5
million cubic meters to improve LAD on three specific waterwayst the Meghna-
Kushiyara; the Titas; and the Kangsa. In addition, about 5 million cubic meters
of maintenance dredging would be carried out to improve access to critical inland
terminals and facilities such as Baghabari Port, the Aricha-Nagarbari-Daulatdia
Ferry terminals and Barisal Port.
Without the Project
10.            Presently, BIWTA dredging operations are inefficient and cost
approximately Taka 34 per cubic meter.  The inefficiencies result from low
utilization of capital assets (dredges operated on two shift basis), lack of
adequate equipment for pipe handling, surveyr and other supporting functions, and
inadequate monitoring of fuel use. Along the rivers which are planned to be
improved navigationally, the LAD is presently 0.9 m which prevents vessels from
operating in a fully loaded condition.
With the ProJect
11.            Dredging costs in constant 1990 Taka are expected to reduce from
Taka 34 per cubic meter to around Taka 25 per cubic meter. The computation of
these cost reductions, and their conversion to economic costs, is shown in Table
5. The table shows also the breakdown of dredging costs between various cost
categories. Computation of transport cost savings due to increase in the LAD on
the three routes for which development dredging is proposed is shown in Table 6.
The savings stem from more efficient use of vessels on these routes, which result
in reductions in the average costs per ton-km or passenger-km. In improving LAD
from 0. 9 m to 1. 8 m, the transport costs for freight are estimated to reduce from
Taka 1.39 per ton-km to Taka 0.90 per ton-kmYV  Similarly,  the cost of
passenger transport also reduces from Taka 0.32 per pass-km to Taka 0.27 per
pass-km. All of these transport costs are estimated in economic cost terms in
constant 1990 Taka.
Evaluation of lenefits and Risks
2/ Cost reductions in freight are primarily from substantial scale economics vf
vessels of 500 tons capacity compared wita vessels of 200 tons. Passenger
savings result from somewhat larger veseel- and reductions in diversions due
to shallow channels.

12.            The dredging works are a& uned to be completed over a four-year
period,  and benefits begin to accrue from the second year.   Operational
improvements and dredge fleet rehabilitation is assumed to take place over a
four-year period, however, the benefits from some of these improvements are
available In the second year. Table 7 presents the computation of the benefits.
13.            Benefits from reduction in the cost of dredging is considered to
apply to both the maintenance dredging works of 5 million cubic mieters (which
would be umdertaken even without the project) and to the development dredging.
The latter is based on the fact that the development dredging is economically
justified at the higher cost of dredging (without improvements). These dredging
cost improvements are also applied to future levels of capital dredging since it
is expected that once these improvements have been achieved they will be
sustained in the future.
14.            Rates of return and present value computations are presented in
Table 8. It is noted that the ERR for Dredge Operations Improvements is low (7.6
percent), whereas the ERR for dredging works is high (ERR 53 percent), and the
combined ERR for the dredging component is an acceptable 23 percent. The NPV for
the dredging component is estimated at Taka 279 million. The ERR with a combined
one year delay in benefits, 15 percent reduction in benefits and 15 percent
increase in cost is 12.5 percent and the NPV reduces to Taka 12.3 million. The
low ERR for the Dredge Operations Improvement component *5 due to its including
substantial amounts for hydrographic survey and for training and technical
assistance. The hydrographic survey investments will yield additional benefits,
outside of dredging, owing to this activity being a support function affecting
all waterway uses.   The technical assistance also will yield additional
(unquantifiable) benefits, because improvements in dredging methods are expected
to eventually influence all dredging in Bangladesh, of which BIWTA dredging is
only a small portion (Bangladesh Water Development Board and the Port Authorities
also carry out dredging, and account for 60 percent of total dredge volukes),
B. Rural Launch Pontoons
15.            This component includes construction and installation of 100 nos.
steel pontoons to be located primarily in the North-East and South-West of
Bangladesh. The geographical disposition of these pontoons are shown in the map
attached (IBRD Map 22007). Each of the locations is presently a landing stage
for motor launches and, country boats transporting passengers and cargo in the
rural areas. On average, these landing stages handle about 40,000 passengters and
about 13,000 tons of cargo per annum. In siting launch pontoons, the S.overnment
will select sites that meet the agreed criteria (Annex 3).
Without the ProJect
16.            Presently, launch landings not provided with pontoon facilities
are accessed with considerable difficulty.   This results, in delays to the
vessels, passengers and cargo, and also results in a higher handling cost and
damage to cargo.   It is estimated that a launch discharging and embarking
passengers without use of a pontoon incurs a delay of about 20 minutes on Average
due to the need to use small country boats to ferry passengers to the shore.
Cargo discharge on bare slopes results in damage of about 5 percent based on
recent estimates. 'Cargo handling costs on bare slopes is estimated at Taka 20

per ton.
With the Proiect
17.            Provision of pontoons is likely to result in a reduction in launch
berthing times on average from 20 minutes to 10 minutes, cargo handling cost from
Taka 20/ton to Taka lS/ton, and cargo damage from 5 percent on average to 4
percent. This will result in substantial savings in vessel time, passenger time
and cargo losses.
Dconomic Evaluation and Risks
18.            Benefits from reductions in vessel berthing time are evaluated as
the sum of vessel time savings and passenger time savings. Vessel time savings
are based on an average value of vessel time estimated to be Taka 3,000 per day.
Passenger time savings are based on an average load factor of 50 percent (i.e.,
the launch is assumed on average to be half full), and average launch capaAity
of 100 passengers, and a value of passenger time of Taka 7 per hour. Cargo
damage savings are estimated based on an average value of Taka 4,500 per ton of
cargo. The last is an extremely low value, and this reflects the likelihood that
more care is taken in handling higher value cargo and therefore the losses are
most likely concentrated in lower value bulk couvsodities.   Details of the
analysis carried out is presented in Table 9.
19.            Benefits are assumed to accrue  in   line with the pontoon
deployment schedule shown in Table 9. Maintenance costs are assumed to be 5
percent of the investment cost, however, it is expected that a major maintenance
expenditure will need to be incurred in year 1S, and this will entail expenditure
of 15 percent of initial investment. The ERR over a 20-year horizon is estimated
at 26 percent, with an NPV (at a 12 percent discount rate) of Taka 311 million
on an initial investment of about Taka 360 million. Sensitivity analyses carried
out indicate that with a combined one year delay in benefits, 15 percent increase
in costs and a 15 percent reduction in benefits, the ERR drops to 15.1 percent
and the NPV drops to Taka 78.9 million. Details are provided in Table 10.
F.  Overall Prolect Evaluation
20.            For the above three major components, combined rates of return and
present value computations were carried out. The base case ERR for the three
project components combined is estimated to be 26 5 percent, with an NPV of Taka
853 million. Sensitivity analysis carried out indicated an ERR of 14.6 percent
with a combined one year delay in benefits, 15 percent increase in costs and 15
percent reduction in benefits. In addition, the rate of return for the overall
project was computed including in the costs of all of the technical assistance
and other components for which benefits have not been quantified. The results
of the economic evaluation are summarized below and details are in Table 11.
