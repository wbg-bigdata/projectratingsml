Environmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Calcutta is one of the most important high-
density corridors in the country. The existing highway is a two - lane carriageway with traffic
bottlenecks and various highway deficiencies. To cater to the existing high volume of traffic, there is
an urgent need for capacity augmentation of this highway.
The Government of India (Gol), acting through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a part
of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MRTH) is improving the Agra - Dhanbad portion of
the NH-2 with assistance from the World Bank. To facilitate the project preparation, the corridor
stretch has been divided into five packages. International consultants have been appointed for the
planning and design of each of these five packages, each about 200km long. Each contract package
has been further divided into several contract packages.
The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangetic Plain in northern India and traverses through the
states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. As part of the Delhi-Calcutta segment of the
Golden Quadrilateral, the Delhi-Agra section (210km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda - Calcutta
section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 4-laned with assistance from the
ADB. For project preparation, the Agra-Barwa Adda section was divided into 16 contract packages.
Eight of the 16 contract packages were selected for Third National Highway Project (TNHP) (Table 1-
1), depending on the project preparedness, progress on land acquisition and utility relocation. Of the
remaining eight packages, seven are proposed to be taken up under the Grand Trunk Road Project
(GTRP). The Allahabad bypass (Contract Package III-B) has not been included as part of TNHP or
GTRP, will be taken up subsequently for construction by NHAI with funding from the WB.

Environmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Package-IA traverses through flat terrain of rich agricultural belt in the Gangetic Plains. The Contract
Package IA extends from km 199.660 of NH2 at Agra (the end of the existing bridge on river Yamuna)
to km 250.500 just after crossing the Thana Mathesana road. Two important towns Tundla (km
222.000) and Firozabad (km 235.000 to 242.000) fall within this package. The other important
villages are Etmadpur (km 217.000), Raja ka Tal (km 233.000) and Thana Mathesana (km 248.000).
The carriageway on the existing highway is uniformly 7m with completely absent or very narrow
paved shoulder width varying from 0.5 to 1.5m.
The very high traffic volumes (as high as 1,25,000 PCUs by 2015 AD) along the initial 22 km of the
corridor, has necessitated the provision of a 6-lane highway between Agra and Tundla. Thereafter,
a divided four-lane carriageway has been proposed for the remaining length of the highway. Rigid
Cement concrete pavements have been proposed for the additional lanes in the project. The
proposed improvements planned as part of the GTRP are presented in Table A.1.

Environmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
1.3 MAJOR FINDINGS OF THE EA
1.3.1 AIR
The NH-2 from km 199.6 to km 255 passes through the Taj Trapezium', an area in which actions
have been recommended to lessen the possibility of damage to TajMahal. The contract package IA
lies entirely in the Taj Trapezium Zone, an area of special importance in the cultural heritage of India
and even the world. The standards for sensitive areas are therefore made applicable for this corridor.
The results from the model indicate than by 2015 A.D., area enclosed within 100m on either side will
exceed the prescribed limits for SPM. CO concentrations exceed the 1000 pglm3 threshold in 2015
A.D. at all locations within 25 m of the centerline and at even 100m from the centerline by 2025 A.D.
The concentration of NO, (as NO2) also exceeds the stipulated 30 pg/im3 by 2015 A.D. at 100 m from
the centerline except for the last 3 km of the package. The highest concentrations are found at the
western end of the corridor near Agra (km 199.6-203) and at Tundla (km 222).
1.3.2 WATER: HYDROLOGY AND DRAINAGE
Yamuna is the western end of the corridor, which continues eastwards several kilometres south of the
NH-2 along the entire length of the package. The general drainage of the area is norlhwest to
southeast.
The problem of drainage is more pronounced along the settlements, as Firozabad, where people
have built barriers along the road to prevent flooding from road run-off. In the absence of any outlet
for the draining of the water collected, water logging along the sides of the highway is an issue that
needs to be addressed. Otherwise, the entire corridor falls in the flat flood plains of the Yamuna. The
design stage has taken care of the drainage across the section as part of good engineering practice.
The provision of adequately sized cross Drainage structures will improve drainage in the vicinity of
the road.
Rigid pavements have been proposed for the additional two lanes proposed for the project.
1.3.3 LAND
The NH-2 in this package traverses over the highly fertile Indo-Gangetic plain. With provision of two
bypasses at Jharna Nala and Raja ka tal, the acquisition of land will be a significant issue since these
tracts of productive soil will be put out of use permanently. 18.0 ha of productive agricultural land
needs to be acquired for these 2 bypasses and 51.17ha of agricultural land to be taken up for
widening along the existing alignment.
The erosion of soils will not be a significant issue since the terrain is plain and the soil is alluvial.
A total area of 10 400 square kilometres covering parts of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in the shape of a Trapezium has
been identified as the zone of influence for the protection of Taj Mahal from pollution sources especially Air Pollution. The
region is home for over forty Protected monuments, three of which are listed as World Heritage Site (WHS) namely the Taj
Mahal, Agra fort and Fatepur Sikri. The major centres covered under the Trapezium are:
*    Mathura and Vrindavan towards its northwest corner;
Firozabad at its south east comer;
*    Kaldec National Park, Bharatpur in the west direction; and
*    Agra as the epicentre of the area.

Environmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
Borrow areas for the project has been proposed mostly on non-productive lands. Redevelopment of
these areas after the borrowing needs to be adequately addressed in the project.
1.3.4 NOISE
Along package 1 A the noise levels are now between 50 and 70 dB (A). It is predicted that the levels
will rise to as high as 88 dB (A) in 2025 A.D. Even the lowest values will be around 64 dB (A) - only 1
dB (A) less than the day time limit for commercial areas. The highest noise levels are at the beginning
of the corridor, on the outskirts of Agra. The largest increases in noise levels are at Firozabad where
the levels rise by 15 dB (A) above the present by 2025 A.D. The smallest increases are predicted for
the Reserved Forest just outside Agra.
1.3.5 FLORA
Between km.204.000 to km.206.000, the corridor passes through Agra Reserved forest just east of
Agra between km 204.000 and km 206.000. The forest is degraded due to human influence and a
400-500 m long stretch between km 204 and 204.6 is used for dumping garbage from Agra. The
improved road could further exacerbate the situation if no remedial steps are taken. Except for this
stretch, land on either side is agricultural or rural/residential. No endangered flora species has been
reported along the highway. The impact of removal of trees however should be a concern, especially
in the first 22 km where 6-laning has been proposed. A total of 7900 trees within the existing RoW
need to be felled for the project.
1.3.6 FAUNA
The historical human influence and the continuous human habitation along the G. T. Road has meant
that there is very little faunal presence except for domestic animals along the highway, especially in
Uttar Pradesh. Even the Agra Reserved forest does not support any significant faunal species. Some
water bodies abutting the highway, do serve as a temporary/permanent habitat for the migratory or
even resident avifauna.
1.3.7 HUMAN USE VALUES
The dominant land use along the highway is agricultural. The major crops grown are wheat, maize,
gram. sugarcane and barley. 71.63 ha of land needs to be acquired out of which 69.67 ha will be
agricultural land. A number of public buildings such as schools, hospitals abut the road. The proposed
widening and strengthening will affect road-side amenities and some locations will be more
vulnerable than before. It is envisaged that the agricultural land along the highway will get converted
to industrial/commercial use to realise the value of the improved connectivity of the area. Increased
vehicular speed mean that the fringe areas of the road are at increased risk from speeding vehicles.
1.3.8 INDUCED/RIBBON DEVELOPMENT
Agra - Past trends indicate a radial pattern of growth along the radiating roads. Expansion towards
the east is restricted due to the presence of physical barrier, the River Yamuna.
Firozabad - The existing NH2 was once a bypass to the city. It acts as a congested city road now.
The area between the erstwhile bypass and the previous road is densely populated. Future growth is
also envisaged along NH2 itself.

1.3.9 CULTURAL PROPERTIES
The entire corridor falls within the Taj Trapezium zone. The Taj Mahal is located about 1 Okm from the
start of the alignment, and there is no adverse impact due to the project anticipated.
There are two sites designated as "Protected Monuments" protected by the Archaeological Survey of
India along Package I-A, namely: Rambagh (km 199.6) and Budhiya ka Taal (km.216.6) . No direct
adverse impacts on these archaeological properties are likely due to the project as they are beyond
the range of being impacted by construction and allied activities. However, in the case of Rambagh,
there was a possibility of the damage to the structures' foundation due to piling for the flyover at the
very beginning of the package. Degradation of the structure due to pollution, risks of collision and
possibility of over-use dominate the concerns related with these and other properties. Adequate
enhancement! Mitigation plans need to be developed for these properties.
Apart from these two protected monuments, there are several small structures along the corridor of
local significance. The detailed drawings of the measures suggested and the associated Bills of
Quantities form a part of this EMP.
1.3.10  QUALITY OFLIFEVALUES
The project is expected to bring in substantial improvement in connectivity along the corridor.
Presently, the traffic conditions are characterised by mixed traffic with bullock carts and high-speed
truck jostling for space on the highway. These combinations create hazardous conditions for all the
road users. With segregation of local and through traffic, by the provision of service lanes, flyovers,
etc. the project will have a beneficial effect on road safety. However, real safety concerns have been
raised with reference to the children using the highway to get to the numerous schools and other
educational institutions that have direct access opening on to the NH-2.
1.3.11 RESETTLEMENT
A total of 1215 families will be affected of whom 643 will be displaced. The entitlement framework of
the GTRP provides for distinct entitlements and assistance for each category of the displaced
families/ persons. For details refer the Consolidated RAP Report and the RAP for Package I-A.

Environrmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES PROPOSED
A description of the various management measures during the various stages of the project is
provided in the following sections.
1.5.1 PRE-CONSTRUCTION STAGE
During the pre-construction stage, the management measures required will include, the clearance of
the RoW, transplantation of the candidate trees identified, the measures for protecting/replacing
community resources such as hand pumps and other utilities likely to be impacted. Their
enhancement shall also be completed before construction actually starts so that the community can
start using these while the construction activity begins.
1.5.2 CONSTRUCTION STAGE
This will be the most intense stage for the environmental management plan. In addition to the
monitoring of the construction activity itself to ensure that the environment is not adversely impacted
beyond permissible limits, the enhancement of cultural properties, mitigation and enhancement
measures for waterbodies will go on simultaneously as the construction progresses.
In addition the need for a balanced evaluation and planning for risks associated with construction
activities related to roads such as accidental spillages and consequent damage to the surrounding
environment in terms of loss of flora and fauna, agricultural crop or worse fertile land, continues to
grow in importance. Other possible locations where a risk assessment2. might be useful include the
locations of Hot Mix plants (spillage of fuel, bitumen etc) and labour-camp sites.
1.5.3 OPERATION STAGE
The operation stage will essentially entail monitoring activity along the corridor. The monitoring for
pollutants specified in the Monitoring Plan will serve the two purposes. In addition to checking the
efficacy of the protection/mitigation/enhancement measures implemented, this will help verify or
refute the predictions made as a part of the impact assessment3. Thus, it will complete a very
important feedback loop for the NHAI.
The measures adopted and/or to be adopted during the different stages of the project have been
detailed in Table 3.
While risk management here deals exclusively with the physical environment, the Resettlement Action Plan addresses
equally real risks on the socio-economic aspects. Contingency Planning may be adopted to set aside resources for the
events for which there is no way of predicting severity and probability of occurrence with any great degree of
confidence. Normally fixed proportion of the emergency response resource allocation is kept always on stand-by to
counter such a situation.
The inputs from this and other projects of similar nature will help improve the quality of the environmental management
plans in subsequent projects or modify any future activities along this highway too. Risk Management during the
operation phase of the project almost exclusively deals with the accidents vehicles carrying fuel or other hazardous
materials. At this stage too, a dispassionate weighing up of the seventy and probability is a must to ensure that neither
too many nor too few resources such as personnel, vehicles or communication facilities are available to tackle the
situation whenever it arises.

Environmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
1.6 REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS
The Monitoring and Evaluation of the management measures envisaged are critical activities in
implementation of the Project. Monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain whether activities are
going according to the plans. It provides the necessary feedback for project management to keep the
program on schedule. The rationale for a reporting system is based on accountability to ensure that the
measures proposed as part of the Environmental Management Plan get implemented in the project.
The reporting system will operate linearly with the contractor who is at the lowest rung of the
implementation system reporting to the Supervision Consultant, who in turn shall report to the PIU. All
reporting by the contractor and Supervision Consultant shall be on a quarterly basis. The PIU shall be
responsible for preparing targets for each of the identified EMAP activities. All subsequent reporting by
the contractor shall be monitored as per these targets set by the PIU before the contractors move on to
the site. The reporting by the Contractor will be a monthly report like report of progress on construction
and will form the basis for monitoring by the PIU, either by its own Manager (Env.) or the Environmental
Specialist hired by the Supervision Consultant.
1.6.1 PRE-CONSTRUCTION STAGE
The reporting from the PIU to the Corporate headquarters of the NHAI will be one of the arrangements
relating with setting targets at the beginning of this stage of the Project. These activities need to be
completed before the site can actually be handed over to the Contractor for the commencement of
construction. The PIU will report on the following items in the pre-construction stage:
*  Tree Transplantation
*  Tree Felling
*  Relocation of Utilities
*  Cultural Property Relocation
*  Bus Stop Relocation
*  Relocation of Community resources -wells and hand pumps
1.6.2 CONSTRUCTION STAGE
The construction period is a very crucial stage of a road project as it entails carrying out multiple
activities. which are all, synchronised and dependant on each other and performance of one activity is
bound to affect the other. The EMAP need not only to ensure reporting on mandatory items such as
quarrying and borrowing but should also ensure reporting on safety and health indicators at all work
sites. The reporting system should so as to keep a check on use of child labour by contractors. The
objective of reporting during the construction is not only progressive and compliance monitoring of the
construction of the road but also a check on concerned environmental issues.
The reporting by the PIU to NHAI (Central) for this stage comprises of
*  Construction Stage Targets for Enhancement and Mitigation (One time reporting)
*  Construction Stage Targets for Landscaping (One time reporting)
*  Construction Stage Targets for Pollution Monitoring (One time reporting)
*  Summary Reporting for Enhancement and Mitigation works.( Quarterly reporting)
* Quarterly Summary Reporting for Landscaping Works. (Quarterly reporting)
* Summary Reporting for Pollution monitoring. (Quarterly Reporting)
The reporting by the Contractor to the PIU shall be on the following items

1.8.2  ADDITIONAL TRAINING AS PART OF GTRP
The training programme proposed in the TNHP has been retained to build a continuum for the
advanced training being proposed as part of the GTRP.
The following training needs have been identified as part of GTRP
* Intensive training on pollution monitoring, ecosystem impacts etc.
*  Policy / Strategy level training for the officers at the Environmental Unit at the NHAI Head
quarters
l Training of NHAI staff to best practices in the field of highway implementation and maintenance
at institutions as TRRL,U.K and FHWA, USA.
*  Refresher courses for environmental management issues like drainage, wildlife protection etc
To carry out the follow-up activity after each training, the training should include a circulation of a brief
written note, or a presentation to the Environment Wing of the NHAI followed by a discussion on the
merits of the course.
1.8.3 LOGISTICAL SUPPORT REQUIRED
The environment cell at the PIU will require a vehicle to inspect works on site. Normally, a four-wheeler
with enough seating for two officers and a driver with space for equipment for measurement will be
needed at each PIU. A four wheel-drive vehicle will be the preferred choice. The vehicle need not be
dedicated for the environmental cell but such an arrangement would be better than sharing PIU's other
vehicles. In addition, the PIU is better of having its own monitoring equipment viz. noise meter, hand-
held gas sensors, etc. in addition the environmental cell at each PIU should be connected to the
Documentation Unit at CNHAI by NHAI-wide LAN (VVAN).
The CNHAI will need not only the e-mail facilities and connection the NHAI-wide LAN. It will also need a
scanner, which can be used with GIS based corridor management system able to handle upto A3 sized
sheets for directly transferring topographic sheets into the system. Adequate computing facilities to
allow the documentation unit to be self-sufficient are recommended. This will include the latest version
of GIS software such as ARCinfo , Mapinfo and Idrisi. All officials at the CNHAI will have their own PC,
43

Environmental Management Plan - Package I A
Grand Trunk Road Project
a common printer and an access to the Internet. In addition they should have access to one licensed
copy of the latest version of the software useful for environmental wing. These could include Caline (for
air pollution modelling from traffic pollution), Sound 32 (for traffic noise) and a fugacity-based model (for
predicting the behaviour of volatile/hazardous material that might spill on the road). A well-stocked
library with books and manuals related to environmental impacts of infrastructure in general and roads
in particular, would be an advantage. The library should subscribe to practitioners' journals along with
academic research journals to keep abreast with the latest developments in the field.
Adequate vehicles (for the Sr. Managers DGM(s) & GM) will be needed. In addition, a separate field
visit vehicle (preferably a four-wheel drive) should also be kept at the disposal of environmental cell for
surprise monitor of construction sites.
The various items that need to be procured for the Environmental Unit are listed below:
*   The environment cell at the PIU will require a vehicle to inspect works on site.
*   Own equipments for pollution monitoring viz. noise meter, hand-held gas sensors, high volume
samplers, water sampling kit etc.
*   the environmental cell at each PIU to be connected to the Documentation Unit at CNHAI by
NHAI-wide LAN (WAN).
*   Adequate computing facilities to allow the documentation unit to be self-sufficient including the
latest version of GIS software such as ARCinfo, Mapinfo and Idrisi etc
*   All officials at the CNHAI to be provided their own PC, a common printer and an access to the
Internet. In addition they should have access to one licensed copy of the latest version of the
software useful for environmental wing. These could include Caline (for air pollution modelling
from traffic pollution), Sound 32 (for traffic noise) and a fugacity-based model (for predicting the
behaviour of volatile/hazardous material that might spill on the road).
*   A  well-stocked  library  with  books  and  manuals  related  to  environmental impacts  of
infrastructure in general and roads in particular, would be an advantage.

1.9.4 NOISE LEVELS MONITORING
The measurements for monitoring noise levels would be carried out at all designated locations in
accordance to the Ambient Noise Standards formulated by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in
1989 (refer Table 1-7) Sound pressure levels would be monitored on twenty-four hour basis. Noise
should be recorded at a "A" weighted frequency using a X slow time response mode' of the measuring
instrument. The location, duration and the noise pollution parameters to be monitored and the
responsible institutional arrangements are detailed in the Environmental Monitoring Plan (Table: 1-8)

transplantation
BACKGROUND
"Transplanting consists in lifting plants bodily from their positions, removing them from more desirable
or agreeable places & replanting them in new & better soil."
3 Season for planting & transplanting shrubs or Trees
*  The best season for planting or transplanting shrubs & trees vanes in different parts of our
country.
*  Hot weather is generally avoided, as the risk of plants not establishing is great.
*  In places where rainfall is moderate, the beginning of rainy season is the best suited time for
transplanting.
*  Plants which are natives of cold countries & which grow vigorously in the cold season such as
Rose, do better when planted out during close of Rainy season.
*  In severely cold places like in northern parts of India, the operations are best carried on
during the end of the dormant season about the end of February.
- All Robust plants may be planted or transplanted during any part of the year, with proper
attention being given to several details of the operations.
THE TRANSPLANTING SUCCESS:
Transplanting involves to some extent at least a disturbance of plant's root system. There is a
loosening of its attachment to the soil & progressive activities are arrested for the time being. Thus
transplanting is a rather violent operation, considering the standpoint of the plant. And is required to
he done with great care to be successful. Care is therefore to be taken that the plants recover from
the set-beck as rapidly as possible. Certain conditions are necessary for rapid recovery of plants to
active growth. Some of these are dependent upon the nature & structure of the plants themselves &
some on the prevailing weather & climatic conditions.
*  Soft-wooded plants transplant better than hardwood plants.
*  Plants in dormant state transplant better than those in active growth.
*  Young plants established sooner than old ones. (Refer article Transplanting Shocks: Large
tree vs. Small Trees)
*  All plants transplant better with a mass of original soil intact around its roots, which should be
disturbed as little as possible.
*  As the roots, till they establish themselves in fresh soil, will be unfit to absorb the full supply of
moisture needed by the plant, exhalation from the leaves & shoots of the plant is to be kept as
low as possible.

*  Cool & cloudy weather are chosen for transplanting operations.
*  Evening are better suited than morning or afternoon, as plant refresh themselves during the
cool hours of the night.
*  To overcome the dangers of transplanting the soil is well prepared & kept moist, not allowing
it to run dry; part of the top of the plant is removed usually to minimise loss of water by
transpiration.
*  Some time shade is provided till the plants are established.
*  Overhead watering by means of spray during the hot hours or occasionally when the leaves
wilt, refreshes the plant to a great extent.
*  The stems & branches of transplanted trees are wrapped with straw which is kept moist by
spraying water on it to remove loss of the water by the plant as much as possible.
*  If the soil is bad below, it is replaced with a mixture of three parts of manure, two parts of.
black fertile earth or Loam, and one part of sand for better growth of trees.
  If the soil is fairly good, only manure is mixed with it, in case soil is heavy sand and manure is
added to it.
*  Transplanting of fully-grown trees can only be successfully done with the help of machinery,
such as the tree lifter, and hence it is rarely attempted in private gardens.
*  Success rate of trees having truck diameter less than 1' would be 90% Success rate of trees
having trunk diameter above 1' to 2' would be 60% Success rate of trees above 2' trunk
diameter can only guaranteed for specific species, in specific transplanting season provided
that the surrounding conditions like soil & weather of the relocated tree are also taken into
consideration.
e  Transporting or shifting of trees on trailer away from the existing location reduces the chances
of success as the trees take more time to set in new conditions, transport may damage root
system & trees are required to be cut down in size to make shifting possible through the road.
*  A tree regains its original shape with in 4 to 10 years depending on the trunk diameter. Thumb
rule is 6" tree regains it original shape in 6 x 12 months.
*  Maintenance or Watering of trees is done till one or two monsoons -We advice maintenance
till the 1st monsoon after transplanting in area where monsoon is good or moderate.
METHODOLOGY
Transplanting of young trees and shrubs is done in the following manner:
1.     The plants have to be lifted with as many roots as possible and replaced in fresh soil with
the least possible delay.
2.     For this purpose a trench 45 to 60 cms in width which is wide enough for working
conveniently is opened out in a circle at a suitable distance away from stem, This
operation is generally called as "Side trenching", which may vary from 4'to 10' according
to the size of the tree or shrub, the soil is gradually removed in the trench approaching
the centre of the circle as it descends, thus securing the ball of earth in the shap &

inverted cone. Care is taken not to injure the roots that cross the trench; these are clean
sawed or cut with secateaurs, if small enough at the outer edge of the trench.
3.     The tap root is also severed. With long crowbars the ball of earth holding the roots is
gently lifted and loosened from its attachment with the rest of the soil.
4.     When the trench is sufficiently deep, the diameter of the ball of earth may be reduced to a
convenient size with a fork, leaving the protruding roots uninjured.
5.     The rootball are continuously kept moist to keep tree active in new root growth &
sprouting.
6.    If one is definite of success, the transplanting may be made safer thus: The ball of earth
may be got ready in two stages, The roots may be severed on one-half of the circle in the
trench & this portion is close down with light soil is known as "root treatment". After
another week or fortnight, the roots sufficiently recovered from the shock of cuts & can be
safely lifted & transplanted.
7.     All the roots with jagged cuts or bruises on them are clean cut back to healthy parts as
bruises and bad cuts may bring on decay, which may spread to the plant, killing it.
8.     While it is well known that roots supply all of a plant's water it is less well known that 95 -
99% of a plant's water is rapidly lost as evaporation from the leaves. Therefore leaf
surface of the Tree is reduced to limit transpiration, it is called "defoliage of tree"; the
tree is cut back, if necessary, to concentrate the sap at the roots for formation of new
roots to establish the tree.
9.     "Heading in" or cutting the top is most desirable in many species. If the tree has several
strong branches starting from this leader, each a smaller branches may be cut back to
half a dozen or more buds, -according to the tree; if there are only few branches, they
may be reduced by one-thirds of their length maintaining its natural shape. The heading
in done because first to keep balance between root system & the canopy (System
underground & above ground should be same to reduce stress on either of it.)
10.    The cut surfaces are all covered with a paste "Waxing" mixture of water soaking &
insecticide liquid to prevent evaporation & to prevent fungus & insect attacks.
11.    The tree is then bodily lifted taking care not to break the ball of and not to bruise the bark
of the stem in the operation. This is called "Transplanting of Trees"
12.   If the ball of earth may happen to be too large to prevent the earth from slipping away, it
is tied with sacking or straw.
13.    Replanting is done to the same original depth if not 3 to 5 cms deeper. It is not safe to
place any fresh manure in contact with the roots.
14.   If by chance the earth breaks away from the roots, these are immediately smeared well
with a thin paste of 2/3 clay and 1/3 fresh cow dung and water and soaking spray of a
fungicide is desirable.
15.    The entire plant is then lowered into the hole prepared for it, which is wide enough to take
in all roots when spread out.

16.    Sand or fine soil is worked in between the roots and the hole filled with good soil which is
pressed down layer by layer.
17.    After the tree is planted, if necessary, it is to be supported by being tied to a stout long
stake, firmly fixed to the ground close to the trunk & protected from cattle by a tree guard.
18.    The stem  may be advantageously wrapped round with moist straw to limit loss of
moisture from the tree,
19.    The tree is then copiously watered soon after planting, so that the entire ball of earth &
the new soil under it, are well moistened.
20.    After such liberal watering, it may not be necessary to water again for another three days
or so. But the tree may be refreshed by spraying on it clear water. It might be provided
with shade if the sun is severe.
21.    The ground around the stem is watered freely every week or so, in the absence of rain.
Too much water is not however to be applied, forming puddles at the bottom of hole in
which the tree is planted.
22.    Throughout summer, the transplanted tree should get its regular water supply, the soil
being soaked through at each watering & not merely sprinkled on the surface.
23.    As the surface layer of earth is drying up each time after watering, it may be stirred to
depth of 2 to 10 cms, forming mulch. This retards loss of moisture from the soil by
evaporation & the tree is enabled to get the full benefit of the water supplied.
It is advisable to carry out all above operations in consultation with & under supervision of
experienced horticulturists as soil strata, weather conditions, the plant characteristic & root systems
may differ from place to place, Thus requiring modification in the transplanting operations.
TRANSPLANTING PROCEDURE CHECKLIST
1. Avoid mechanical damage and dehydration during transport.
2. Avoid planting when weather is hot, dry, and windy, especially with plant material
in full leaf.
3. Make sure planting pit is at least twice as wide as root ball.
4. Remove all wire, rope, twine, etc. from root ball.
5. Prune the tree or shrub.
6. Use a light, well-drained backfill material with plenty of organic matter.
7. Make sure the tree or shrub is planted high, 2 to 4 cms below surrounding grade.
8. Water the plant, using a hose as a probe to eliminate air pockets.
9. Mulch the planting area 3 to 5 inches deep.
10. Wrap tree trunks with tree wrap. Remove the following spring.
11. Stake and guy trees. Remove the guys after one year.
12. Water the plant carefully throughout its first growing season.
