Yemen:
Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Environmental Impact Assessment: Executive Summary
1. The Project Scope and Introduction
Tius document summanses the environmental impact assessment, environmental management plan and
social studces done for selected water and sewer mvestments planned for the City of Sana'a The
portion of these investments to be financed by IDA, under the proposed Sana'a Water Supply and
Samtatiorn Project, have been categonsed by the World Bank as a Category "B" project for the
purposes of thls assessment
2. The Project Description and Setting
The GOY has a comprehensive strategy for the development of water and wastewater services in the
City of Sana'a These are specified m the "Sana'a Water Supply and Samtation Services
Development Progranmmne, Draft Final Report, October 1998" The most immedcate of the planned
mvestments under the Development Programme are generally referred to as "Sana'a 1" and include the
items discussed below and whlch will be financed with the assistance of IDA's Sana'a Water Supply
and Samtation Project Investments that will follow Sana'a I are usually referred to as the "Long-
Term Programmre"
Investments under the Development Programme will proceed m at least two phases, startng with
Sana'a 1, which consists mamly of the Akamah Sewage component and the Hasabah Water Supply
Rehabilhtation component Sewer mvestments under the Long-Term Program for the city mnclude
mvestments m the Safiyah East, Saba'een, and Sawad Hanash areas ofthe city.
The Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan descnbed m this volume
covers. (i) Sana'a 1 (financed by IDA under the proposed Sana'a Water Supply and Saintation
Project), and (u) the three areas descnbed in the previous paragraph for the Long-Term Progranmne
IDA's Sana'a Water Supply and Samtaton Project would consist of the followmg components Water

Sana'a I and the Long-Term Progranme are set m the City of Sana'a, in established and built up
areas All the proposed civil works will take place in dedicated utility rights-of-ways.
Akamah
The Akainah Project area covers some 145 hectares and will house around 47,500 people at a relatively
high residential density, (in the context of Sana'a) of around 280 persons per hectare (pph). It typically
compnses low quality housing developments but also contains two mam commercia streets.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
The system is designed as a separate system, i.e. for sewerage only, not a combined storm drainage and
sewerage system. Some 3,000 houses will be connected to a new sewer via about 30 kms of 150 mm
uPVC pipes running from private inspection chambers to a collection chamber then to the nearest
manhole or sewer line. An additional 2,000 households may be connected to the new sewer network
after the close of IDA's project. The project will potentially remove 2,900 cesspits in the Akamah area.
It also includes construction of about 4 kms of sewer trunk main ranging in diameter from 600 to 900
mm.
Hasabah:
The 325 hectare Hasabah area is one of the more densely populated areas in Sana'a, but is projected to
have a density in the year 2000 of only 147 pph. The ultimate density of 200 pph is projected to be
reached by year 2005. No further population infill can be accommodated. The total population to be
served is therefore estimated at 65,000.
This component of the project comprises the rehabilitation or replacement of large portions of the water
network in the Hasabah area. The project envisages about 27 kilometers of pipe to be replaced,
including portions of the primary, secondary and tertiary network. Some 20,000 house connections will
be added in the area during the analysis period and about 6,000 existing house connections and meters
will be replaced.
3. The Environmental Review and Assessment
The Environmental Review and Assessment
The proposed IDA project has been reviewed, screened, and designated for Category B consistent with
the provisions of the World Bank Group's Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E, "Environmental
Assessment". There are no major environmental issues involved. Further, there are no land
acquisition, involuntary resettlement, indigenous people or cultural heritage issues. The Project has no
effect on international waterways. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Management Plan
was prepared by the Borrower with the assistance of international consultants and comprises three
elements:
* Project Description and Statement of Baseline Conditions
* Impact Statement
• Environmental Management Plan
In the EIA, extensive use is made of two household and commercial establishment surveys undertaken
as part of project preparation activities (summaries included in the Project File).
Major Environmental Issues and Mitigation Measures
The project has three main environmental issues, none of which are considered major or which will
cause irreparable harm to the enviromnent after the application of the proposed mitigation measure.
These issues are: (i) cesspit removal, and disposal of cesspit sewage during the initial months of
construction; (ii) the disposition of dried sewage sludge; and (iii) the handling of chemicals used to
flush rehabilitated or new water lines.
Cesspit Ranoval and DisDosal of Sewa=e:
Descnption: Before the new wastewater treatment plant is operational in December 1999, a maximum
of 600 cesspits will need to be destroyed during the initial phase of civil works under Sana'a 1. This
Y9701                                    -2-                                 March 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services          Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
represents about 90 m3 per day of wastewater, for a maximum of about 9,000 m3 for the four months.
This sewage will be trucked to the existing pond wastewvater treatment plant for disposal. This existing
plant is often over-loaded and, therefore, not achieving design standards for treatment. However, this
waste will only contribute a maximum additional load of 1.5% of design capacity of 6,000 m3. Given
the desire to remove raw sewage from the crowded Akamah residential and commercial neighbourhood
as soon as possible, it is considered the better alternative to remove the sewage and carry it to the
existing pond treatment plant than to wait for the opening of the new wastewater treatment facility.
This is especially the case in light of the modest sewage quantities involved and the planned mitigation
program described below.
Mitigation: Prior to construction, community leaders will be advised of the details of work in their
area. Measures to prevent casual public access to the site will be undertaken, with particular emphasis
on children. Open pits in the construction areas will be covered at night in such a way that they cannot
be casually uncovered. During the first four months of the project, liquid wastes will be transported to,
and disposed into, the existing pond WWTP. Given that this treatment plant is already operating at or
over capacity during peak hours, wastes will be transferred in off-peak hours. Site supervisors will be
present at both the construction and treatment plant to register vehicles, and to ensure that unauthorised
dump sites are not used. Monitoring of coliform levels in the ponds will be undertaken to ensure that
health in the area of the WWTP is not being endangered. Aeration devises may be used, if feasible, to
improve treatment effectiveness.
After the initial four-month period, i.e., by December 1999, the new WWTP is expected to be
operational. It will easily handle all wastes from the destruction of the remaining approximately 2,300
cesspits. Operating specifications and capacities of the new plant are included as an Appendix C to the
EIA.
Dried Sewage Sludze:
Description: The new wastewater treatment plant will produce about 32 tons per day of sludge with a
30 percent moisture content. The plant site has a storage area that will accommodate approximately 15
months of accumulation. The government currently has no policy on the use of dried sludge and has
not identified a final dumping site or other disposition measures.
Miigation: Dried sludge from the existing WWTP is being sold to local farmers, who compost it, and
there is enough demand to dispose of 80,00 tons per year. However, a fomial wastewater and sludge
reuse policy will be developed with assistance from IDA as part of the Project (see Environmental
Mitigation component of the Project).
Disposal of Hazardous Chemicals:
Description: The use of small amounts of hazardous chemicals will be used as part of the normal
cleaning procedure during the final stages of the water system rehabilitation component. The Project
involves the installation or rehabilitation of 27 kilometres of pipe, ranging in size from 80mm to
600mm, and the amount of chemicals necessary for flushing is expected to be modest. Pipes will be
flushed with water containing 40-50 ppm chlorine gas over a 24-hour period.
Mitigation: The contractor will be resposible for training workers on the handling of such chemicals,
and providing suitable safety gear. Spill prevention and counter-control rneasures for hazardous
chemicals will be specified in a contingency plan (included in the EIA Appendix). Spills of hazardous
materials will be promptly cleaned up and chemically treated. Workers handling these spills will wear
overalls and gloves in addition to any other protective equipment that may be needed. Wastewater
containing hazardous chemicals will be routed to the new wastewater treatment plant and the feed rate

of hazardous chemicals limited to levels that can be handled by the plant. No flushing of new water
lines will be undertaken before the new WWTP is operational. Hazardous chemical treatment training
will be provided to wastewater treatment plant staff. Finally, compliance with the proposed provisions
will be monitored by an Environment and Safety Officer (ESO) in the PMU.
Secondary Environmental Issues and Mitigation Measures
Emplovee Health and Safetv:
Soil in project areas will be sampled to test for contamination. In the case of minimal risk, simple
mitigation measures will consist of wearing appropriate clothing, and education of workers. In the case
of more severe contamination, waste material will be excavated and taken to an appropriate NWSA and
EPC approved site.
Public Safetv:
A number of public health and safety measures are addressed to limit risk of an accident involving the
public. These would include erecting appropriate fences and walkways to permit safe passage of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic in and around the site. On-site inspectors will supervise heavy
equipment use.
Public Health:
As part of the public infonnation campaign, the population shall be advised as to the nature and extent
of the works proposed. Capacities of local hospitals and clinics will be assessed and, if deemed
necessary, a project clinic will be established in project areas without easy access to existing facilities.
Collectio Stora-ge and Disuosal of Household Wastewater:
The contractor will establish a special unit to specifically handle this task. This unit will dispose of the
wastewater in a manner that prevents spillage of wastewater. All such wastes will be transported to the
inlet sump of the WWTP, and will not be handled by any workers outside of the designated unit.
Abatement of Noise and Air Pollution:
A detailed plan for the control of noise pollution is included in the EA. The measures to be undertaken
will include proper maintenance of equipment, erection of screens, use of muffling devices to minimise
both dust and noise pollution, and strict monitoring of vehicular traffic used in project works. Noise and
dust levels will be kept within recommended World Bank and Yemeni standards.
Public Consultation Process:
Despite the fact that this type of category '1B" environmental project does not require a public
consultation program, the Govermnent of Yemen has nevertheless implemented an extensive program of
public awareness and consultation. This program comprises three components: (i) public meetings; (ii)
newspaper and television articles and programs; and (iii) household surveys. Each of these are
summarised below:
Public Meetings: To date there have been 3 public meetings about the project. The first was on 26 July
1997, and the latest took place on 20 February 1999. Another meeting is scheduled before the start of
construction, and at least semi-annual meetings are planned during th csuctio odpeig4 Q-
average, these public meetings are attended by about 30 to 35 people living in the affected

neighbourhoods. Topics discussed typically include the deterioration of sewerage conditions, the
duration of construction, and the number of households served.
Newspaper and Television Coveraze: To date, there have been 5 newspaper articles about the project.
The first appeared on 22 May 1998, and the most recent was on 16 November 1998. In general, the
articles discuss sewerage problems, what the project will do to alleviate these problems, and reports on
the status of the project. On 25 October 1997, the PMU Director for the Project, among others, were
on a live television show discussing potential impacts of the projects' works, and answering questions
on how to facilitate the construction process.
Household Surveys: Characteristics of the two household surveys undertaken prior to the start of the
project are summarised in the following table:
Table E. 1: Description of Completed Household Surveys

Results of the surveys show that households consider street flooding from cesspit overflow to be the
most important enviromnental consideration in their neighbourhoods. Household respondents also
expressed a strong preference for a conventional water bome sewer system as the remedy for this
situation. The Project plans a follow-up survey in the Akamah area halfway through its
implernentation penod, which is estimated to be one year after the sewage network has been completed.
Overall Cost of the Project's Environmental Program
A sumnmary of the Project's environmental issues, mitigation program, and associated costs is
summarised in Table E.2. For Sana'a 1, the cost is expected to be around $230,000. This includes the
salary of the ESO, the cost of all mitigation measures and monitoring, the cost of a new standby
generator for the old wastewater treatment plant, and the cost of a sludge and wastewater re-use study.
Overall mitigation costs are expected to be around $350,000.
Conclusions
The overall impact of the Project is to significantly improve environmental conditions at every phase of
the project cycle, but particularly in the Akamah area. Until completion of the new WWTP,
environmnental impacts from the disposal of cesspit sewage at the existing WWTP are epected to be
minimal, and any adverse impact is outweighed by the immnediate improvemnents in the Akamah area.
The environmental review concludes that the proposed project will generate overwhelmingly positive
environmental, social and economic impacts. With its migation measures, the project does not present
negative environmental consequences. Detailed discussion of all items, including the complete
mitigation plan and item-by-item costs, are included in the EIA.

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1      PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
This Report has been prepared for the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project (SWSS),
Contract Addendum No. 1. The addendum for this IDA supported sub-project was signed
between NWSA and Dar Al-Handasah Consultants (Shair and Partners) in March 1998 and
the project commenced in March 1998
This project is done in Sana'a, in established and built up areas. The project will proceed in
two main phases, starting with Sana'a 1, which consists mainly of the Akamah Sewage Project
and the Hasabah Water Supply Rehabilitation Project. Sana'a 1 is part of the much larger
Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project (SWSS). The second phase, commonly referred
to as the Long-Term Program, includes the Safiyah East Sewage Project, the Saba'een
Sewage Project, and the Sawad Hanash Sewage Project.
1.2      REPORT SCOPE
This document comprises the Environmental Impact Assessment for the defined works. It is
prepared under the guidelines provided by the WB in their OD 4.01 for a Category B Project.
The project category being defined in the addendum.
This report therefore comprises three basic elements:
-     Project Description and Statement of Baseline Conditions
-     Imnpact Statement
-     Environmental Manageiment Plan (EMP)
AUl the civil works take place in dedicated utility rights-of-ways. All projects within the Long-
Term Program are accommodated in the EIA though there is a clear emphasis on the Sana'a 1
projects.
Extensive use is made of the surveys undertaken as part of the SAWAS and Sana'a Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (SWSS) projects and the World Bank's survey' (ESS) of the
affected communities, to attempt to quantify project envirornental costs and benefits.
1.3       REPORT STRUCTURE
The structure of the report reflects the Scope of the works undertaken defined above. It
contains six firther sections as described below.
The legislative and institutional frameworks for the project and the environmental sector as a
whole are summarised in Section 2.

Section 3 provides a general description of the projects including a brief overview of project
objectives and need. Existing environmental conditions including a review of socio-economic
conditions are summarised in Section 4.
Project Impacts, both positive and negative are outlined in Section 5.
The remaining Sections, 6 and 7 comprise the EMP. Section 6 contains the Mitigation Plan
developed in direct response to ameliorate the significant negative impacts outlined in the
previous section. Section 7 describes the proposed Project Monitoring works.
The final Section contains the proposals for EMP Implementation. These include:
-     Programme Responsibilities and Implementation Structure
-     Reporting Schedules
-     An Implementation Schedule
-     EMP cost estimates

2.       ENVIRONMENTAL APPRAISAL FRAMEWORK
2.1      INTRODUCTION
This Section provides an outline of the existing framework for the execution of Environmental
Appraisal works in Yemen.
Section 2.2 deals with the institutional framework for EAs. Specifically, the identification of
agencies, governmental and non-governmental, that have responsibilities relating to the
preparation, supervision and management of EAs and, or, that may contribute to the review
process. This is followed by three further Sections, 2.3, to 2.5 that outline, respectively, the
legislative, policy, and financial frameworks supporting the defined institutional structure.
The final, Section 2.6, outlines other projects and programmes in Yemen, which contain
Environmental, Water, and/or Sanitation components.
2.2      INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
2.2.1     Governmental Organisations
A.        Primary Authority
Prior to 1995 primary responsibility for environmental matters in Yemen resided with the State
Ministry of Environmental Affairs, although an Environmental Protection Council (EPC) was
established in 1990 under Prime Ministerial decree 94. This council was reformed by the Prime
Minister's decree (No. 28) of 1995, to perform the tasks outlined in Table 2.1.
After 1995, and as a result of the reforms brought about by the enaction of the Environmental
Protection Law (Law No. 26 of 1995), (EPL), the EPC became the government agency with
primary responsibility for environrental matters.
Under Article 5 of the EPL the EPC is required to
undertake the preparation of the general national policy for environment protection and its
control and shall carry out in co-ordination with concerned bodies to execute such policy
after approval of the cabinet. Each concerned body shall adhere and be obliged to implement
the decisions, resolutions and recommendations that are issued by the counciL
Accordingly, the EPC has, primarily, an oversight and management function with many
responsibilities remaining with existing authorities. To facilitate this oversight role, the EPC is
established as one of three entities under the direct control of the Cabinet and its annual
budget is part of the budget of the Council of Ministers.
EPC Structure
The EPC itself comprises the 11 members identified in Table 2.2.
Y9701                                 -2.1-                            March 1999

The present structure and allocation of responsibility within the EPC is proposed to change to
the new structure shown in Figure 2.1. It is understood that this new structure is now before
Cabinet for final approval.
The Technical Secretariat of the EPC was formed in 1992 to undertake the tasks defined
under the Prime Minister's decree, No. 34. In effect, the administering of the EIA process and
any other requirements and procedures included in the EIA legislation. This involves not only
the drafting of EIA guidelines, standards and regulations but also the implementation of the
EIA Process.
EPC Operations
Despite the problems that have beset the country since the establishment of the EPC and the
obvious constraints that this would impose on the operation of new government agency, as
Table 2.3 indicates, the EPC has a number of achievements to record.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Ser.vices            Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
Notwithstanding, at this time, EPC, is still in the early stages of capacity building in all areas,
the development of human resources, the definition and establishment of standards and the
development of EIA policies and guidelines. It is being supported in this by an assistance
programme sponsored by the Dutch Government.
Working Groups composed of EPC focal teams, expatriate and local consultants, and other
governmental organisations have been formed under this assistance programme. The activities
of the Working Groups are the following:
* Planning and Co-ordination
* Environmental Legislation
* Data Information Management
* Environmental Awareness and Education
* Water Resources Protection
* Urban and Industrial Environment
* Land Resources Protection
* Natural Habitats.
B.    Other Competent Authorities
Given the above and the nature of the EIA process, (especially in the setting of standards) it is
inevitable, during this transitional phase that many of the key environmental responsibilities in
Yemen still reside with other 'competent authorities'. The situation with regard to water
supply sanitation and public health is however perhaps more complicated than most as
indicated in Table 2.4.

The project proponent, NWSA has, at this time, no dedicated environmental management or
plamning capacity at either their Head Office or the Sana'a Branch Office.
2.2.2      Research Institutions-
The principal governmental structure is supported by a limited number of research
organisations, primarily at the Universities of Sana'a and Aden.

The Dutch government is particularly active in this area providing support to the University of
Sana'a in two key areas that are of direct relevance to this project:
-      S lupport for the Centre for Empirical Research and Women's Studies;
-      Strengthening of the Department of Civil Engineering in the fields of sanitation, and
water and environmental engineering.
The International Institute for Infrastructure, Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering (IHE),
Delft has provided, since 1989, the technical and financial assistance to the strengthening of
the latter programme in the Department of Civil Engineering by providing capacity building
measures in both the academic and applied fields.
Two phases of the programme are completed and the third phase is in progress.  A water
quality monitoring laboratory equipped with latest and technically advanced apparatuses has
been established under this programme to monitor the quality of the water supplied and the
influent and effluent of the WWTP.
2.2.3      NGOs and CBOs
As the list in Table 2.5 indicates, there are a large number of Yemeni NGOs that could, in
theory, have a role to play in the development and implementation of a sector environmental
strategy.

Unfortunately, the reality is that few if any of these pre existing 'environmental' national
NGOs can be considered truly effective at present, or potentially, as principal players in the
implementation of a sector strategy in the future. There are a number of reasons for this.
First, and most importantly, many of the NGOs are in fact quasi-government agencies and
therefore can not, and are not, viewed as independent bodies by the population. The 1963
YAR Law No. 1 13 still provides the legal framework for the establishment, organisation,
registration of organisations and clubs of a cultural, social and charitable nature.
While the right of citizens to form NGOs is recognised in the constitution of Yemen4, the
stipulations of Law 11 are restrictive in a number of ways. Two specific examples provided
below illustrate how potentially pervasive government control of an organisation could be.
Law No. 11 specifies:
-     that NGOs must have a board of directors, a general assembly and election procedures,
but also specifies that the meetings of the general assembly beginning from the day of
foundation must be monitored by a representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs
(MOILSA today) who must sign the minutes.
-     that MOILSA has the right to take control of, or abort the society whenever this is
deemed necessary.
In the former case MOILSA may also abolish a society or freeze its activities merely through
an administrative decision to reject or not response to an application for, or renewal of a
license or simply by failing to dispatch a representative to a meeting.
Though the law clearly provides the opportunity for government interference in NGO
activities, it need not necessarily do so. However, the unevenness and seemingly arbitrary
application of lawss, either by design or accident implies that this is not the case. Many
agencies function effectively believing that they can only do so through government patronage,
thereby breeding public distrust.
2.3    LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
2.3.1      General Framework
The EPL is now the framework environmental legislation for Yemen. In general terms it
provides for the controlling of actions or activities described as being 'unsafe to the
environment'. Specific provisions in that act that may relate directly to this project are
identified in Table 2.6.
3 A Draft NGO law is under study by MOLSA. It is understood that this draft has been prepared with little
or no input from NGOs themselves and that it effectively establishes tighter control over the activities of
NGOs than the exwsting Law. It is considered unlikely therefore that any of the dscussion provided will be
made redundant by the promulgation of a decree establishing the new law.
4 Articles 5, 6, 7, 14, 27, 32, 34, and 41 of the Amended Constitution of September 22th 1994
S For example in the case of licensing: Licensing periods often vary and may depend on the influence of the
founders, some NGOs operate without a license, some are not required to apply for license renewal.

Beyond these specific provisions of the EPL a plethora of other laws and regulations dealing
with the environment exist. The principal pieces of legislation and their areas of jurisdiction are
outlined in Table 2.7. A more extensive list is provided as Appendix A.
2.3.2       EA Legislation and Guidelines
As noted earlier the EPL contains provisions for the enacting of legislation on the requirement
for an EIA in project development. The relevant bylaw has been drafted and approved by the
EPC and is now before the Cabinet. It is understood from discussions with EPC officials that
this draft legislation does no include any measures that vary significantly from the initial
documentation prepared with the assistance of Euroconsult in 1996.

A similar situation prevails with respect to standards and guidelines. The EPC has released
draft standards for Wastewater Quality and Air Quality (see Appendix B) but a comprehensive
set of standards is not yet available. In their place international standards, primarily those of
the World Health Organisation (WHO), are used.

2.4    POLICY FRAMEWORK
The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)6 has been prepared with the support of the
UNDP and World Bank and was published in 1996.The principal elements of the NEAP as
they affect the Water Supply and Sanitation Sectors are summarised in Table 2.8.
While the NEAP does not have any legal, it provides the policy framework for the actions of
the EPC. As such, it provides guidance on the application or otherwise of the available
legislation though, in Yemen, as in most countries, the existing body of legislation (prior to the
EPL) was probably sufficient to provide adequate protection to the environment had there
been an effective policy framework for its application.

Waste Management                Wastewater management

Source: NEAP, 1996
2.5    FINANCING FRAMEWORK
Article 92 of the EPL (1995) stipulates that an Environmental Protection Fund (YEP) is
established to receive all moneys allocated by the GOY to protect the enviromnent. This fund
has now been established and is managed on a day to day basis by the Chairman of the EPC,
or more usually his delegated authority.
Table 2.9 summarises the overall structure of the YEP, its potential sources of revenue,
eligible beneficiaries and eligible projects
It is not a function of this study to assess the adequacy or otherwise of the funds allocated to
the YEP, or the effectiveness of their use. Suffice to say that discussion with the EPC and
others active in the environmental arena imply that the funds available are generally insufficient
for EPC to effectively perform the actions with which it is tasked in the EPL.
6 The EPL Article 5 (2) requires the EPC to prepare a National Environmental Action Plan; the official
organ of the state and shall undertake the preparation of the general national policyfor environment
protection and its control.
The NEAP is thus considered to be established element of the Environmental Framework.

2.6    CONCURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT FRAMEWORK
In addition to the specific works of the EPC there are a number of other projects and
programmes ongoing that have some potential relevance to the environmental appraisal of this
project. Those supported by extemal assistance (Government and Non Government) are listed
in Table 2.10.

3.        PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
3.1       INTRODUCTION
This section contains summary descriptions of the five (5) project components considered
under this EA.
These are:
* Akamiah Sewage Project
* Safiyah East Sewage Project
* Saba'een Sewage Project
* Sawad Hanash Sewage Project
* Hasabah Water Supply
In total some 395 hectares of the city is proposed to be sewered under the Long-term
Program, and some 325 hectares connected to the water supply network. The areas concerned
were located on Figure 1.1.
The following sections 3.2 and 3.3 provide the rationale for the projects, their need, objectives
and anticipated benefits. This is provided separately for the Sanitation and Water Supply
projects.
Sections 3.4 to 3.8 describe the projects individually. These sections include a brief outline of
physical project components and processes and the relationship between project components
and elements of existing systems on which they may be dependent.
The detail provided below in the project descriptions varies considerably and reflects the
extent of project development thus far.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
All sites are connected to the water supply system (albeit receiving supplies only periodically),
but existing public health and environmental conditions are extremely poor, with raw sewage
frequently running along streets and ponding at low points. In some of the more extreme cases
sewage enters private houses and mosques.
The source of the problem is the percolation pits, normally located in the middle of the street,
to which each building is conmected. These rarely function properly as a result of the clogging
of soil pores and a past lack of cleaning and now overflow on a regular, if not continuous
basis. Vacuum trucks may be used to withdraw some of the septic sewage, but this is
expensive and is an option rarely exercised. In addition, lack of regulation and enforcement
results in unacceptable disposal practices by the operators, which simply transfer the problem
elsewhere.
When asked to rank their concerns over sanitation respondents the 520 households involved in
the ESS surveys (carried out in the Akamah and neighbouring Sawad Hanash Areas) clearly
identified three major sanitation issues:
Street flooding (with) Sewage:         45% of first choice
- Cost incurred in cleaning cesspits:  30% of first choices
High incidence of water related disease:    52% of second choices
The proposed projects are intended to alleviate these problems by:
-     demolishing and making safe all of the percolation pits; and
-     the construction of a sewerage system connecting the area to the existing public
network.
3.2.2     DesiLn Criteria
(i)    General
Attempts were made to identify national specifications or standards related to pipes, fittings,
valves and accessories and discussions on the matter were held with offices of the Yemen
Organisation for Standardisation, Meteorology and Quality Control.
It is apparent that national standards covering these areas have not yet been developed.
International standards, BS and 10-States, have therefore been adopted as appropriate.
The design criteria for the project (and for all other Sewage related project components unless
otherwise specified) are as outlined in Table 3.1.
(ii)   Pipe Material
Pipe materials were selected on the basis of a number of criteria:
* Resistance against chemical attack, intemally from the sewage and externally from the soil
conditions.
* Smoothness of inner wall surface.

* Mechanical strength and resistance to backfill and traffic load with least additional
protection.
* Local availability; Regionally or locally manufactured or available in the local market or,
neighbouring countries.
* Ease of use; Pipe weight, range of length available as standard.
* Cost.

(iii) Manholes
Manholes will be provided for inspection and maintenance at junctions, drops, changes in pipe
diameters, directions and gradient, and at regular intervals to facilitate cleaning. They will be
either pre-cast circular rings or cast in situ for large sewers. Inner walls and benching will be
protected with tar epoxy lining.
Drop manholes will be provided for sewer diameters equal or smaller than 600 mm where the
difference in inverts of the inlet and outlet pipes exceeds 0.6 m. For larger diameter sewers,
drop manholes will be determined by pipe and fitting dimensions. Table 3.2 presents the type,
dimensions and spacing of manholes.

3.3       SANITATION PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
3.3.1     Akamah Seweraue Network Proiect: Sana'a 1
The Akamah Project area covers some 145 hectares and will house around 34,000 people at a
relatively high residential density, (in the context of Sana'a) of around 280 pph. It typically
comprises low quality housing developments but also contains two main commercial streets.
The network will serve a population of about 41,000 inhabitants by 2005 and thereafter. The
basic network layout is shown on Figure 3.2.
(i)    Project Components
The proposed project comprises two contract components:
(a)     Area Collection Network
This comprises a gravity sewer network for an area of approximately 145 ha. The system is
designed as a separate system, i.e. for sewerage only, not a combined storm drainage and
sewerage system. Some 1,060 house connections will be provided via 150 mm uPVC pipes
running from private inspection chambers to a collection chamber then to the nearest manhole
or sewer line. A house connection comprises 3 connections to individual inspection chambers
as per Figure 3.3, therefore about 3,180 households will be added to the sewer network.
The proposed collection network comprises:
-     28,000m of 200-400mm pipes,
-     2,150m of 500 - 600mm uPVC pipes
-     820 manholes.
-     1,060 house connections

According to the SWSS, some 88% of households are now connected to the NWSA network
and receive water on average once every 4.5 to 5.0 days.
By these parameters the area is relatively well served. However these figures disguise the true
situation. The distribution system comprises ad hoc networks of small diameter pipes
operating at very low pressures. Thus while water may be available it is only in very limited
quantities. This is reflected most clearly in the relative expenditure by residents of Hasabah on
tankered water estimated in the SWSS survey, Table 3.7.

Moreover hydraulic analysis undertaken in the preparation of the Development Plan indicates
that the existing network could not provide minimum water requirements2 to much of the area
even if water supplies were to be available in significantly increased quantities.
The area has recently been sewered in a project funded by NWSA. Under present conditions
this system will not function efficiently. There will be insufficient flow.
Design Parameters
The Hasabah area is one of the more densely populated areas in Sana'a but is projected to
have a density in the year 2000 of only 147 people per hectare. The ultimate density of 200
people per hectare is projected to be reached by year 2005. No further population infill is to be
accommodated. The total population to be served is therefore estimated at 65,000.
A supply provision equivalent to a domestic consumption rate of B0 I/c/d is targeted for this
area in the Sector Development Plan (SDP). Community (non-domestic) consumption is set at
33 percent of total consumption, equivalent to 40 I/cld in this case. Accordingly, total
domestic and community water consumption is projected to reach 120 l/c/d by the year 2020.
Available records of unaccounted for water (the margin between water produced and water
sold) were collected from NWSA, Sana'a Branch. These are listed below, as a percentage of
water consumed (produced):
Year                       1992     1993     1994     1995      1996     1
Unaccounted for water    | 41.2%   | 33.3%    34.5%    32.0%/ | 33.3%
2 The minimum water requirement is defined at 35 l/cld by the draft Cabinet Resolution on Water Sector
Reform and adopted in the Development Programme as the minimum option

These system losses are expected to decrease in the future following the rehabilitation of the
distribution network and as a result of the anticipated leak detection programmes and related
measures proposed in the SDP. The target maximum loss is set at 20% in the SDP.
Therefore, with a basic consumption rate of 801Vc/d, a 33% allowance for non domestic
consumption and a further 20% for losses, the design per capita consumption rate is 150 l/c/d.
On this basis, total water consumption in Hasabah is expected to be around 3.2 MCMly.
Design Criteria
(i)    General
Attempts were made to identify national specifications or standards related to pipes, fittings,
valves and accessories and discussions on the matter were held with offices of the Yemen
Organisation for Standardisation, Meteorology and Quality Control.
It was determined that national standards covering these areas have not yet been developed.
International standards (BS) have therefore been adopted as appropriate.
The design criteria for the project are as outlined in Table 3.8.
(ii)   Pipe Material
The following materials assessed for suitability for use under the projected physical and
hydraulic conditions of the Hasabah Water Supply Project and found satisfactory: Ductile Iron
(D.I.), uPVC, and for small diameter pipes Polyethylene (PE) and Galvanised Mild Steel
(G.M.S.).
Further assessment based on the following criteria led to the selection of Ductile Iron (D.I.)
Class K9 for pipe diameters greater than 400 mm and uPVC Class PNIO for pipe diameters 80
mm to 400 mm.
x Mechanical strength and resistance to backfill and traffic load with least additional
protection.
* Local availability; Regionally or locally manufactured or available in the local market or,
neighbouring countries.
* Ease of use; Pipe weight, range of length available as standard.
* Cost (Table 3.9).
The working pressure of uPVC pipes was selected as 10 bars to allow for decrease in pipe
pressure ratings caused by water temperature. This class of pipes will withstand the allowed
maximum pressure in the network (65 m) at temperatures higher than 35 C. The measured
maximum water temperature in Sana'a public network is around 30 *C.

(iii) Fire Fighting System
The water distribution system will be designed as a combined network to cater for the
requirement of the Civil Defence in Sana'a City and the international code of practice for fire
fighting (NFPA). The fire fighting tankers (Pumpers) of the Civil Defence will obtain the water
for fire fighting from fire hydrants acting as filling points. The minimum pressure of 20.0 m
adopted at each node of the network is sufficient to fill these tankers.
The Hasabah area is considered a low risk area for the following reasons:
D Most buildings are one or two floor buildings and are not interconnected. Typically
buildings will be separated by at least Im of open space, usually considerably more.
* Building materials used are mainly stone and concrete (86% of all buildings in 1994), which
are fire resistant.
These conditions will lower the risk of fire spread and the occurrence of large fires.
Accordingly, the total fire fighting demand is calculated based on the assumption of the
occurrence of two fire events, each fire will be fought off by two fire streams for a duration of
two hours. The required water will be stored in the water storage reservoirs of the distribution
network.
Fire hydrants will be instaled on pipe diameters not less than 150 mm in order not to cause
excessive pressure losses in the water supply system.
3.4.2     Proiect Components
The Hasabah area falls within the low level pressure zone of the Sana'a water supply system.
The primary network designed in the Development Programme for the low zone is retained in
this study and the Hasabah secondary distribution network was designed accordingly.
All house connection components supply and the installation of underground works are
included under the Project scope of work. However, above ground house connections works
are excluded. These are to be carried out by NWSA.

Project works (Figure 3.8) will comprise the following:
* Excavate trenches not exceeding < 2 m depth and lay:
-  21,700 m of pipes of diameter 200 mm and less
-  2,700 m of pipes of diameter 400 and 500 mm
-  2,700 m of pipes of 800'mm diameter.
* Install various valves and accessories (see Table 3.8)
* Install valve chambers as required (approximately 25)
* Install fire hydrants (approximately 80)
* Flushing and disinfection of laid pipes
* Restoration of existing surfaces
According to NWSA Sana'a Branch, most of the existing water pipes constructed in Phase
One are either damaged or leaking and therefore they will be replaced. The pipes constructed
during Phase Two are about 15 years old and made of D.I. pipes. Most of these pipes are in
good physical condition and may be relied on for the next 25 years. Accordingly, some 7,000
metres of existing network pipes will be retained in the proposed water supply network.
3.4.3     Proiect Status
Project works completed to date are outlined in Table 3.10. Works remaining to be carried
out include:
-     construction and testing of the new water supply networks.
The Bidding Documents prepared on the basis of the preliminary design will be modified, if
required, upon the completion of the final design.

4.        BASELINE STUDIES
4.1       INTRODUCTION
This Section outlines the physical and socio-economic context for the project. Section 4.2
deals with the description of the physical environment and natural resources of the study area,
and their status. Section 4.3 provides some background data on the affected populations, size,
age, sex structure and level of education. This section also includes a brief assessment of
gender issues.
Income and expenditure pattems are reviewed briefly in Section 4.4. As with most such
reviews this is relatively brief and while it the individual data sources utilised provide for a
relatively coherent pattern internally, there are apparent discrepancies between sources.
Section 4.5 contains a description of the urban environments in which the project is set; the
urban planning framework and rates of urban growth, housing conditions, service provision,
etc. Section 4.6 deals with the specific issue of public health.
The final Section 4.7 provides a brief overview of the quality of the available data base and
highlights areas of potential significant weakness for the definition of potential impacts.
Throughout this Section data is provided at one of three levels; National, Sana'a urban area,
and Project sites as it is available.
4.2       PHYSICAL CONTEXT
4.2.1     Soils and Structural Geolo2v
Sana'a city is situated on a plain of Quaternary alluvium surrounded by mountains, mainly of
Quaternary and Tertiary Volcanics. The alluvial deposits consist of horizons of clay, loess like
silt, sand, gravel and larger particles and contain appreciable volcanic detritus. The deposits
become finer grained to the north.
The Tertiary Volcanics can be distinguished into three layers: Basalt, chaotic volcanics and
chaotic and stratoid volcanics.  The black, sometimes green-black basalt, is a dense
homogeneous basalt flow with columnar jointing. The chaotic volcanics consist of a non-
homogeneous mixture of volcanic products and alluvial deposits. The chaotic and stratoid
volcanics include more homogeneous stratoid rocks such as tuff.
The Tawilah Sandstone, a medium to fine grained fluviatile and deltaic sandstone and
conglomerate, occasionally interbedded with mudstone and siltstone layers, underlies much of
the Plain to the south of the city at depth, and outcrops to north west and north east.
While, at the regional level, the structural geology is reasonably complex, with extensive fault
systems and associated structures -present, the Sana'a basin itself is typically tensive, with the
vertical movements on the plateau minor, especially when compared to those of the
escarpment facing the Red Sea. Nevertheless, as would be expected with its proximity to the
Red Sea Rift Fault system the study area is moderately seismically active.

Soil investigations have been undertaken for the Akamah and Hasabah Areas. These were
carried out in May 1998 as indicated in Table 4. 1.
Table 4.1  Site Investigation Programme
Area                       No of Pits                  Depth of Pit
Akamiah                        14                  5.5m below ground surface
Hasabah                        12                           3m
In both cases, Standard Penetration Tests (SPT) were performned in the pits at 2.Om depth
(intervals) from the surface and bulk samples were collected for laboratory testing.
The laboratory tests included sieve analysis and determination of the Atterberg limits for the
material passing No. 4 Sieve.
The overall (standard) profile defined is as below:
Akamah                                Hasabah
Fill layer    0 - 25cm    Sand, Silt, clay, plastic  0 - 40cm  Sand, Silt, clay, plastic bags,
bags, paper, etc.                    paper, etc.

_      3 pits    Basalt                      1 pit    IBrownish weathered siltstone
The fill layer comprises a mixture of sand, silt, clay and gravel and also contains various waste
materials, pieces of paper and cloth, polythene bags, etc. Given that the fill material will have
to be removed and not reutilised in excavation works, it was not analysed further.
The alluvial deposits encountered were common to both sites. They typically comprised a
variety of soil mixtures ranging from fine silty clay to coarse gravely sand with the presence of
boulders and cobbles on some occasions. The variability of the materials encountered is typical
of alluvium, where the particle size of the soil deposits depends on their mode of deposition
and is greatly influenced by the carrying stream shape and gradient.
In both areas, the reported SPT results were highly variable. At Hasabah, the average SPT
value N was 27 with a Standard Deviation of 15 and at Akamnah the N value was 19 but with a
Standard Deviation of 13. In general, these values correlate to loose to medium dense
cohesionless soils with an angle of internal friction, + of 28 to 30 degrees. Where cohesive
soils were encountered (Akamah), the recorded N values were of stiff to very stiff clays of an
unconfined compressive strength of 1 to 4 kg/cmr. No clear relationship could be deduced
between N values and depth of test.
Groundwater was not encountered at any of the pits.
Excavation in the alluvial deposits will be relatively easy and will not warrant the use of heavy
excavating equipment such as rippers or jack hammers. The clayey materials found are stiff
enough to stand sub-vertical, without support, provided they are kept dry. However while the
cohesionless soils will also be stable with minimum slopes the variation in their relative density
and level of cementation is such that precautionary measures should be-undertaken. However,
side stability can be secured with nominal support.

The cohesionless alluvial deposits are suitable for use as backfill, after removal of the
oversized particles (exceeding 100 mm). The finer cohesive materials may also be utilised
provided they do not contain material with a plasticity index exceeding 6 percent.
The basalt is black, moderately weathered, strong to very strong. Excavation in this rock will
require the use of mechanical rippers. Protection against rock spalling shall also be required
during excavation, especially where the rock is highly weathered. The siltstone belongs to the
Tawilah Sandstone formation and actually outcrops on the surface in the vicinity of the pit.
4.2.2     Topoeraphv
The study areas are almost entirely built up and have a generally low relief. Detailed (1:1000)
topographic mapping (streets only) available for Akamah and Hasabah provides a similar
picture. At Hasabah, the maximum and minimum height (masl) vary by around 20m with
gradients usually <1% occasionally increasing to 1.5% trending broadly SW to NE. Gradients
are slightly more pronounced in Akamah (change in elevation of 27m) but are still <2%, at 1
to 1.5%. Overall the dominant, SW-NE slope trend is evident though in this particular area
localised stronger west to east trends are present.
Elsewhere, the available mapping does not allow for any assessment although the pattern
evident for Hasabah and Akamah would be expected to be repeated.
4.2.3     Climate
In 1992, the Technical Secretariat of the High Water Council (TSHWC) defined a series of
climatic zones for the Northern Part of Yemen, under which the study area is variously
described as being in the Temperate Highland Zone and the intermontane plain depending on
the nature of the classification. Rainfall is generated by three meteorological phenomena:
* The Mediterranean Effect
In the winter months, (especially in December and January) the influx of polar air that follows
the passage of a depression may trigger light rainfall. However, such events are infrequent
occurring on average every 3-5 winter seasons.
* The Red Sea Convergence Zone (RSCZ)
The RSCZ is caused by the rapid heating up of land surfaces (relative to sea warming) that
gives rise to the generation of onshore winds that are then affected by the convection effects
of the Western Highlands. As a consequence humid air masses are lifted and carried eastward
to give rise to heavy, but short and highly localised, rainstorms. The RSCZ is at its most
influential from March to May, and to less notable effect in the autumn.
* Monsoonal ITCZ
The Monsoonal ITCZ influences Yemen from July to September when warm dry air from the
Arabian (and African) land masses to the North mixes with moist southerlies from the Indian
Y9701                                 -4.3-                             March 1999

Ocean. The rain producing effects of the ITCZ are most keenly felt on the Western and
Southern Escarpments where the triggering orographic effects are most significant. The
Eastern Escarpment receives relatively little in the way of rain from the influence of the ITCZ,
though as the ITCZ moves north (before retreating south again) areas as far east and north as
the Sana'a plain may receive rainfall benefits.
Micro relief effects are significant in the Sana'a Basin which has higher land both to the west
and east.
Mean maximum monthly temperatures on the Central Highlands, while in the temperate range,
are still moderately high at 23.5 - 29.6 'C. There is however a marked diurnal range at higher
elevations often over 150 in the summer and more 18 -20 IC in winter. This pattern is reflected
on an annual basis with significant variation in the winter and summer minimums and
maximums. In winter, the absolute minimum is -6.5 'C with mean monthly minimum of
0.5 IC. The summer absolute maximum in the collected records, is 31.5 'C, however,
temperatures were recorded in summer 1998.
Evaporation rates are high totalling in excess of 2000 mm throughout the Sana'a Plain-though
again the influences of altitude and microrelief on a range of climatic data, Humidity,
Radiation, and Evapotranspiration Data are clearly evident.
Overall moisture deficits incurred in the Central Highlands are in the range 1600 - 1700 mm
per annum.
Principal climatic data for three stations in Sana'a are provided in Figure 4.1.
4.2.4     Hvdrologv
The principal surface hydrological feature in the study area is Wadi Sailah, which runs north -
south through the city.
In the past the wadi has had a multiple function, as a drainage channel, as a green space, and
as7a funnel channelling the dominant north easterly and northerly winds through the city. These
functions are now severely degraded. The findings of the Sana'a Urban ecology survey of
1995 summarised in Table 4.2 remain valid today with in most cases some further
deterioration in conditions.
Unless corrective measures are taken it would appear inevitable that the wadi will be continue
to be urbanised and developed with potentially very severe adverse affects.
From the specific hydrological perspective the present carrying capacity of the channel with
respect 10, 25, 50 or 100 year return floods is unknown. While project areas themselves may
not be directly affected by the Wadi the main sewer Interceptors taidng sewage from the city
to the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to the north of the city use the wadi as a right of
way.

No air quality surveys have been undertaken for this study and meetings held with the EPC
confirm they have yet to initiate an air quality monitoring programme in Sana'a. A monitoring
station is now available at the EPC Headquarters and is expected to be operational shortly. It
is planned, for the longer term, to establish a network of stations throughout the cify.

Despite the lack of empirical data, it is apparent that there are a number of sources of potential
nuisance and, or, a threat to public health as indicated in Table 4.3.
Of these by far the most important are the Stabilisation Ponds or Lagoons. However, while
their nuisance value is significant, there are no actual measurements of Hydrogen Sulphide
levels, or data from the Ministry of Health that permit determination of the true, as opposed to
perceived level of health threat and the size of the population potentially affected. In any case,
the new WWTP is expected to become operational in December 1999, at which point the
existing pond plant will be closed, thereby nullifying any potential health threats.

4.2.6      Noise
Discussions with the EPC have indicated that:
- no noise monitoring has been undertaken, and
*  it is the qualitative / judgmental assessment of EPC staff that noise is not a significant
concern within Yemeni culture. Indeed, the concept of noise pollution is not readily
recognised and the potential adverse impacts on health etc. are not generally understood.
Moreover, despite the age of much of the vehicle fleet and driver characteristics, the relatively
low levels of traffic; and the infrequency of flight operations from Sana'a airport dictate that
the principal sources of noise concern in most cities are muted in their effect in Sana'a.
Similarly while there are a large number of individual point sources, factories, etc. these too
are generally not a major source of concern. The most significant, in a localised context are the
motors driving private water pumps.
4.3    DEMOGRAPIHY
4.3.1      Existine Sana'a Pogulation
The latest definitive estimate of the population of Sana'a is provided by the 1994 census which
indicates a total urban population of some 954, 450, distributed as shown in Table 4.4.
As Figure 4.2 shows, overall population densities, at that time were moderately low, generally
in the range of 150 - 300 for mature neighbourhoods and only 84 pph for the approved zones
as a-whole. Only in one exceptional case did gross densities exceed 350 persons per hectare.

4.3.2     Ponulation Forecasts
Table 4.5 contains a summary of the three population growth scenarios were developed for
estimating future water consumption, reflecting high, moderate and limited growth. The
assumed growth rates under each scenario are given below:
- fHigh: 6.1 % in 1997 declining to 4.2% by 2020.
- Medium: 5.6% declining to 3.3% in 2020
- Limited and 5.1% declining to 2.4% in 2020.
As can be seen from Table 4.5, the population of Sana'a City in the year 2020 under these
scenarios will range from 2.29 to 3.47 million.

4.3.4      Ponulation Characteristics
(i)    Household Size
Household sizes in Sana'a are relatively high when compared to the National average. They
are also high in comparison with other Middle Eastern countries. For example, they are well
above those of Jordan as shown in Table 4.7. Moreover, household size in Yemen appears
also to have increased in comparison with the Census of 1984, when they were estimated at
6.32 persons, compared with 6.74 in 1994.

Source: Jordan, General Census of Population and Housing 1994, Yemen 1994 Census.
In the future, household sizes will be expected to decline broadly in line with the decline in
rates of natural population growth. However, even by the end of the plan period household
sizes will remain relatively large.
In the context of the water and sanitation sector these figures imply that the basic unit of
supply, will also remain large facilitating the development of an effective delivery system with
relatively few connections. To place this in perspective a reduction in household size from the
present Sana'a City level of 6.79 to that for Zarqa (6.28) and Amman (5.79) will reduce the
number of domestic units by 33,500 and 71,772, equivalent to some 54% and 110% of 1997
estimated household connections respectively.

(ii)   Population Structure
Analysis of the population structure of Sana'a shows that it reflects underlying trends typical
of the Region, in particular having a high ratio of young population. With 40 % to 45 %
under the age of 15 and over 50 % under 19, the values for Yemen are at the high end of
expectations. (See Table 4.8).
Table 4.8: Simplified Age / Sex Structure of Sana'a City Population (%f°)
Age          Male         Female        Total
0-15         22.34        21.03         43.37
15-40        25.73         17.01        42.74
40-59         6.57         3.86         10.43
60+          1.87          1.60         3.46
Total        56.51         43.49        100.00
Source: Census, 1994
In the short term the implications of this structure will be felt in:
* considerable pressure for the creation of jobs, with an annual entry into the Sana'a job
market of 10 000 - 15 000 persons per annum2,
* the creation of major stresses on public services, in particular the education system which
would, under conditions of universal primary education, expect 25 000 to 30 000 entrants
to the system annually to the end of the project period.
* substantial increase in the female population in reproductive cohorts.
(iii)   Households Per Structure
As the data from the SWSS provided in Tables 4.9 and 4.10 overleaf suggest, the average
number of households per structure is closer to two than one. More surprisingly the number of
households per floor appears to be relatively constant irrespective of the overall number of
floors of the building.
This is reflected in the consistently high room occupancy rates. A figure of 2.2 persons per
room is reported for Akamah and Hasabah.
4.3.5     Education
Education levels are generally low with national adult illiteracy rates among the highest in the
Region and well above the MENA average. The position is not as extreme in Sana'a. Even so,
over 40% of adult women and around 20%/ of adult males are illiterate, Table 4.11.
2 For indicative purposes this value is calculated as 80%/ of male 17 year olds and 10 % of female 21 year
olds.

4.3.6      Gender Issues
At a general level and highly simplistic level, Yemeni society draws clear distinctions between
the responsibilities of men and women:
Women: Are the dominant force in the home, and within the house. They are traditionally
responsible for cleaning the house, preparing the food and educating children. Some of the
work, washing, (cleaning, helping prepare food) may be delegated to the children, primnarily
daughters. Women may be also be restricted in their movement, being allowed to leave the
house only in the afternoon and then only to visit relatives or female friends.
Men: Are traditionally expected to represent the family outside the house. He is responsible
for obtaining the family income and usually will do the shopping. In circumstances, where
some conflict in roles may be perceived to apply, such as carrying solid waste to rubbish
containers or collecting water, children are usually delegated the task. Where no conflict is felt
to exist, women will be responsible.
The right of women to work and participate in the development process without hindrance or
discrimination was established in legislation3 in the constitutions of the YAR and the former
PDRY and since unification in the Constitution of the ROY. Despite this it is clear from the
available data (Table 4.12) that women have either been unable, or have not desired, (or both)
3 YAR clause 36: "Every citizen has the right to practice the career he or she chooses within the limits of
the law"
clause 10     "Yemeni citizens are equal in the right of labor"
clause 34     All texts organizing the employment of both sexes are appLicable to working women
without distinction ......
PDRY clause 27: "Labor is the right and duty of every capable citizen, corresponding with his or her
ability, qualification and rights without distinction based on age, sex, blood, color,
religion or language"
ROY           Labor is a right and honor: it is deemed inevitable in developing the society. Every citizen
has the right to practice the job he chooses for himself within the limits of the law. It is
unlawful to impose through compulsory means jobs on any citizen, except as stated by the
law to carry out a public service without fair wages in return

to participate fully in the workplace and that there has been little or no change in the last 10
years.

Factors that are still perceived to restrict this participation include:
*  Society perceives woman's primary role as in the home to the extent that that is where the
woman will inevitable end up. Accordingly, education is not a necessity for women, many
of whom may suffer restricted access to basic education. This is strongly reflected in the
variable literacy rates for men and women (Table 4.12 above) and in particular, at later
stages, in access to a scientific and technical education. Laws requiring compulsory
universal primary education have been in existence of laws for many years they are rarely if
ever enforced and in some cases especially in rural areas no girl only facilities are available
because of a shortage of female teachers.
* Even when educated initially, strongly perceived pre-eminence of role in the home
associated with very young first marriage and very high total fertility rates combine (Table
4.13) to reduce secondary and further education opportunities and limit female skill
development opportunities.
* Conflict with the traditional view that the man is the income earner, exacerbated by both,
the potential social stigma that may be attached to a man whose wife is either the sole or
part income, and the potential competition for some between men and women jobs.

Surveys undertaken in 1985, 1991 and more recently in 1994 do indicate positive trends
suggesting for example that the overwhelming majority of urban Heads of Household approve
of women being allowed to work.
In addition, to the general constraints imposed on participation in-the labour market, women
also appear to be disadvantaged in that where they do participate they are not fully utilised. In
general terms women tend to be employed in the public sector, often in 'reserved occupations'
where they have little opportunity to develop a professional career and or where their potential
is rarely fully realised.
Women have been successful in the broader development process only in those areas that are
culturally allocated to them, maternity care, child nutrition, illiteracy programmes etc.
Nevertheless, the successes in these areas, and especially those promoted and supported by the
General Union of Yemeni Women should not be underestimated or undervalued.
In project specific terms the following conclusions are drawn:
* Given that no land acquisition and resettlement is proposed, there will be no circumstances
in which women are deprived of their due compensation rights.
• There will be significant loss of employment and as such no particular disadvantage to
women through employment loss.
* Similarly, women are unlikely to benefit directly from reductions in workload. These
benefits are most likely to fall to children who are charged with carrying out most domestic
duties outside of the home; fetching water, disposing of waste, etc.
The primary area of benefit will be in the reduction of time and other resources spent in crisis
management as the family manager; fewer occurrences of disease, fewer sick children, reduced
health costs and greater productive time with children.
4.4    INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
4.4.1     Income
Data on household and per capita income in Sana'a City and for Yemen as a whole are scarce.
Available estimates are shown in Table 4.14. The estimate of income in Sana'a City by
SAWAS (1995) and the results of the SWSS are very similar, at YR12,500-13,000 per family
(of 6.79 persons) per month, equivalent to US$170-177 per capita/year at current (October
1997) exchange rates.

The 1992 Household Budget Survey, revised for inflation to 1995 values, give an average
income figure of about YRI 1,300 per family per month, for the whole of Yemen, or US$154
per capita/year. Allowing for a small income inflation factor for Sana'a5, this is consistent with
the other estimates. World Bank estimates of GNP for Yemen were US$250 per capitalyear in
1995 and about US$280 per capita/year for 1997/98. However, GNP includes elements of
national income additional to those accruing to households, and is therefore not directly
comparable with the other estimates shown in Table 4.14.
The SWSS results for average incomes in Sana'a City have been summarised in Table 4.15.
All households in the survey sample had income from employment or business, and 21% had
supplementary sources of income (from rents, pensions, interest, remittances, etc.). Average
earned income was YR10,833 per famnily/month, and average income from other sources was
YR2,163 per family/month, giving an overall average family income of about YR13,000 per
month, equivalent to YR156,000 per year or YR22,990 (US$177) per capitalyear. Median
household income was estimated to be in the order of YR10,500 per family/month. (about
80% of average income).

There is of course a relatively high degree of uncertainty attached to the results, as with those
of any sample survey of income, but the figures are broadly consistent with other estimates.
4.4.2     Expenditure
Data on expenditure patterns is even more difficult to obtain and reconcile with income. In
terms of Water and Sanitation services, weighted average expenditure on domestic water
supplies in the Project areas and Sana'a City in 1997 as derived from the SWSS is estimnated at
YR3,247 per family/year. In the Project areas these costs are a little lower (see Table 4.16).
Weighted average household expenditure on sanitation services (NWSA piped sewerage
system and emptying of cesspits) has been estimated at YR686 per family/year.
Internally within the SWSS, the pattern of income and expenditure seems reasonably
consistent and although there is no clear correlation between the main source of water supply
system and levels of family income there is some correlation between total consumption and
income.
incomes in Sana'a would be expected to be above the average for the country as a whole, given the higher
proportion of relatively well-paid formal employment in the City

There are however considerable differences in the results of the SWSS and the ESS, especially
in two areas:
(i)    The indirect costs/expenditure incurred in supplementing either the quantity or quality
of water available
The ESS identify a number of additional expenditures by households as follows
-     12% of households filter tap water because of fears of contamination; estimated cost
$0.13 per capita.
-     Estimated time spent fetching water; 11 minutes a day for an average 2.5 I/c
equivalent. Not costed.
-     More than 30% of households purchase water at a cost of $10.95 per capita per
annum. This compares to 12% in SWSS survey areas and range of from <10% to 25%.
-     Overall expenditures on all types of water estimated at $30per capita per annum, say
$200 per household. This compares with the SWSS results that put the unweighted
average at $158 and the absolute maximum, at $174 per household.
(ii)   Health costs
Health costs reported in the ESS are estimated at $16 per capita or around $112 per family
some 5% of total family income. These compare with estimates of $1.85 per capita, or around
0.6% of family income.
In both cases, it is important to stress, that the issue is one of the scale of the costs incurred,
and not whether they are incurred.

4.5       URBAN DEVELOPMENT
4.5.1     Urban Planning Framework
Urban Planning is the responsibility of the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban
Planning (MCHUP) and as noted in Section 3, an Urban Planning Law has been introduced
and provides for three levels of planning to take place, Regional, Master and Detailed. Thus,
while past experience of the execution of urban planning programmes has not been particularly
encouraging, the fact remains that the legislative and administrative structure is in place.
At present, no comprehensive programme of Master Planning or detailed planning is ongoing
and there appears to be no intent to re-start the GTZ and MoCHUP "Planning Assistance for
Urban Development" programme of the mid-1990s. That programme completed much of the
basic groundwork required to undertake both Master and Detailed Planning, including the
preparation of design guidelines and standards, and most of that work will still remain valid.
However, delays of more than two to three more years in re-establishing the programme or an
alternative, will require most of it to be repeated.
4.5.2     Urban Growth Pattern
As Table 4.17 shows, since 1967, urban growth in Sana'a has been explosive, expanding from
a smaUl settlement of some 6 - 700 hectares and accommodating 56000 people to the present
city accommodating nearly 1 million people and sprawling over some 11000 hectares of
approved development areas.

In 1967 the urban area was largely confned to four areas:
-     two central high density zones; the western area of the Old City including the Souk and
a second around Gaa Al-Ulufy.
-     a third central zone, around Gaa Al-Ulufy of limited density (<85pph)
-     new developments to the south and the north of the Old Town
-     the remaining part of the urban area characterised by very low densities.
By 1979, the developed areas were Rawdhah and the airport, and the Sana'a city. The
principle growth axis at this time was to the north, a process that was to be reinforced by the
recommendations of the 1978 Louis Berger/ Kampsax Plan that from a purely physical
perspective made complete sense, i.e. the mountains to the east and west should constrain
growth of the urban corridor to a predominantly north - south, axis.

However, while the basic alignment of growth has been as intended, the greater majority of the
development has occurred to the south, and on the primary road corridor to Taiz (SE), and to
a lesser extent along the following corridors:
* to the west along the Hodeidah road
* to the north-west along the Wadi Dahr road
This is in direct contrast to the specific intent of the 1978 Master Plan, where it is
recommended that expansion to the south of the city be curtailed.
4.5.3     Housina and Housing Conditions
The housing stock of Sana'a is characterised by the following:
-     Generally large houses or villas built on a single plot of land often with a garden. These
will typically be of one to three storeys (more usually one and two) and may
accommodate more than one household. Usually all households on one plot will be
from the same extended family unit.
-     Apartments; rarely of more than seven storeys in height.
-     Ushah/Sandakha; temporary or impermanent structures more often than not made from
a combination of materials, wood, zinc, hay and plastic sheet.
-     Others may include emergency housing, work housing or collective housing
(dormitories, prisons etc.)
Overall, bearing in mind the relatively low estimated per capita income the quality of the
housing stock in Sana'a city is good. There are only a few obvious examples of concentrations
of low-quality housing. However where these do occur, they tend to be located on lands
previously considered undevelopable and have their origins in a specific local or regional
event. As such the communities involved tend to be somewhat more homogenous than is
found elsewhere in the city.
The most obvious examples are the squatter settlements along the banks and increasingly
within Wadi Sailah. Aside from being unsightly and unsanitary these camps are under serious
(and as the % of hard areas in the catchment increases, increasingly serious) threat from flash
floods
Outside of these areas, and the confines of the Old City, residential developments in Sana'a are
unusually heterogeneous incorporating a wide range of land uses, building types and building
quality. Perhaps more than anything else this steams from two factors:
-     the explosive growth of the city and the its relative structural immaturity

4.5.4      Service Provision
In terms of service provision, the picture is less satisfactory. While, as Table 4.18 indicates the
proportion of households supplied with water from the public system is relatively high at 88%6
this figure disguises the inadequacy of the supply provided, described at length elsewhere. The
values for the power system are considerably better and reflect much more closely the true
level of service provision.

All areas to be sewered in the Sanitation project are served by the Public supply network
though supply provision is intermittent (usually a minimum of one day in four, but often
better) and variable between areas depending on location. The Hasabah area has recently been
sewered.
4.5.5      Physical Environment
Until the mid 1960s Sana'a was a largely traditional urban centre that had developed an urban
ecology that was largely in balance. The population estimated at around 50 000 had grown
only very slowly if at all over preceding centuries. The consumption patterns of the economic
structure (of which the population is an integral part) based on traditional technologies in
construction, transport, water supply energy provision etc. were by necessity balanced with
available regional resources and would also include significant recycling.
However, the radical political change of the mid-1960s and the period of massive population
growth and associated economic and social change that followed and persists to the present
day have all but destroyed that ecological balance.
Today, the quality of the urban environment of Sana'a is poor and under pressure from a range
of factors is continuing to deteriorate. Of principal concern are:
* Solid Waste Dumps (Dumping)
Most parts of the city are scattered with what are effectively solid waste dumpsites. Typically
such sites will result from the overfilling of containers and use of common land in particular
wadi beds (Wadi Sailah for example) as open dumps, The factors contributing to the problem
are numerous and the interrelationships between them are complex. However, Schluetter 1995
identifies four principal factors:

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
(i)    Generally poor sector management; from wrong location of containers, poor choice of
containers, inadequate maintenance of vehicles, etc.
(ii)   Lack of awareness among residents and cultural issues. Islamic tradition and teachings
promotes hygiene and the responsible use of natural resources and these are evident in
the cleanliness of individual homes and some public facilities such as mosques. The
major problems occur in public places, roads, wadi beds etc. where old traditional
management systems such as those based on the muhtasib or equivalent have been
replaced by central government or municipal agencies which clearly do not function
with the same degree of effectiveness or community support, (as reflected in the
present extremely lax attitude to disposal of waste).
(iii)   Role of urban livestock. Despite the entirely urban nature of much of life in Sana'a, a
number of herdsmen (usually women or children) persist in browsing urban areas
(mainly on the outskirts of the city and in the old town) with their sheep and goats to
replace the feedstuff of the common rangelands that have either been lost to urban
development or from which they are now excluded for one reason or another.
(iv)   Societal structure: A strong link between low quality housing areas and problematic
solid waste dumps
Sewage pools
Raw sewage pools occur throughout the city collecting in both natural depressions and man
made low points. The sewage originates from three sources:
(i)    Overflow: Percolation pit overflow is by far the most significant factor in this regard.
(ii)   Direct discharge: In specific locations the existing sewage network discharges into
open, usually natural, channels. In some cases infiltration / seepage (with resultant sub
surface and soil contamination) and natural grades will combine to prevent surface
lakes forming. Elsewhere where natural channel beds have been modified large and
small retention ponds have been created.
(iii)   Sewage System  Leakage: This is relatively minor, contributing much more
significantly to the pollution of groundwater resources.
The brief review of key factors above is not to say that other factors can be ignored. They
must not. Factors such as the Air pollution, from diesel pumps and generators, cars and
construction materials, Noise pollution, from diesel pumps and generators, cars, and Water
Wastage, all contribute to the production of a very heavily degraded urban environrent,
especially in public areas.

populations. These Consultants covered this lack of information in their limnited survey (see
below). It has not been possible therefore undertake any statistical analysis that would define
causal linkages between the characteristics of an area7 and health problems. Therefore only
qualitative conclusions can be drawn from this data. The incidence of indicator diseases in
Sana'a City and Sana'a in 1996 is shown in Table 4.19.

These results may be compared to the observations made by Dr. Lantini (Table 4.20) in the
original 1975 Italconsult Sewage Master Plan prior to the development of any centralised
water supply and sanitation systems.

In reviewing Tables 4.19 and 4.20, a number of apparent conclusionis can be drawn:
* Public Health conditions in the rural areas of Sana'a Governorate are considerably worse
than those in Urban Sana'a to the extent that the data presented would need to be further
investigated.
* The incidence of Malaria reportedly virtually unknown on the Sana'a plain! 10 years ago is
growing rapidly and if present trends persists it will represent a significant drain on national
and regional resources
* Hepatitis has now grown into a major public health threat to all members of the population.
Doctors are particularly concerned over the numbers of carriers apparently being reported
from tests carried out of blood donors.

* The major epidemic diseases, Cholera and Typhoid appear to be under control. Doctors
contacted in the preparation of this report suggest that the reporting of Typhoid is
significantly overestimated, based on the fact that results of laboratory tests report infection
at levels too low for an endemic area such as Yemen. Cholera has recently occurred in rural
areas but prompt government action prevented any serious outbreak. Nevertheless the
conditions for a major outbreak of either disease in Sana'a are in place.
* Gastro-enteritic complaints and diarrhoea remain a constant concern.
These conclusions are however not reflected in the trends in infant mortality and maternal
morbidity summarised in Table 4.21.
This apparent discrepancy may be readily explained by the improvement in child care /maternal
over the past 15 years or so, in particular the ongoing programmes of immunisation and child
care and survival9 being undertaken by the Ministry of Health with the support of international
agencies.

4.6.2     SWSS
Data derived from the SWSS on the relationships between the incidence of diarrhoea,
intestinal infections and skin diseases, and the source of families' water supply or their method
of sewage disposal, are shown in Table 4.22.
The following tentative conclusions may be drawn from the data:
* 100 % of the sampled households in three of the areas of the City suffering most from the
specified diseases (Himmyar, Taiz Street and Safiyah) have connections to the NWSA
water supply network. Between 47% and 500% of households in these areas suffered from
the specified diseases, against an average for the whole sample of 39%/o.
* The fourth- area with 100% NWSA coverage (Musayek/Old City) had a relatively low
incidence of disease, but this could be explained by the fact that this area has the highest

single rate of connections to the NWSA sewage network (50%) of any of the sampled areas
(see (iii) below).
* The three sampled areas with a high proportion of water supplies from private networks
(Saba7een, Industnial Complex and Haddah) also suffered from an above average incidence
of water-borne diseases (between 44% and 49%). This again suggests that watel supplies
are contaminated, probably due in this case to seepage of sewage from cesspits into the
aquifers from which water supplies are drawn.
* There is no very obvious correlation between the use of welt/tanker water and water-bome
disease.
* The three sampled areas with the lowest incidence of water-borne or sewage-related
diseases (Hasabah, Musayek and Tahreer) all have relatively high rates of connection to the
NWSA sewerage network (between 20% and 50%). This suggests that the presence of
piped sewerage can contribute to a lower incidence of water-borne or sewage-related
sickness and, conversely, that the present system of cesspits (soakaways) on which 72% of
households depend for sewage disposal presents a serious health hazard.

4.6.3      Summary
While much of the above text has concentrated on the estimation of the actual costs of illness
related to poor sanitation these estimates provide little real information on the potential scale
of the public health problem in Sana'a and no indication of trends.
This can be derived only from the past published data which indicates that with the exception
of infant care and maternity the public health situation in Sana'a has not improved markedly
since 1975. On the contrary, when the increased prevalence of Malaria and Hepatitis and the
size of the population that may be at risk from a major epidemic are considert. it is not
unreasonable to conclude that the wider public health has declined.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
In the final analysis perhaps the most immediate measure of the potential threat to public
health of present sanitation conditions is provided by health professionals who in the
discussions undertaken for the ESS:
-     describe the incidence of water related diseases as above average,
-     suggest the conditions for a major outbreak  of cholera are met and that it would
spread like a fire in the forest.
4.7    DATA WEAKNESSES
The principal areas of data weakness encountered in preparing this report are as follows:
* Air quality and Noise
No monitoring data for the above was found. Any future assessment of impacts will therefore
have to be based one off stochastic assessments of baseline conditions
3 Income and expenditure
Although the SWSS and ESS provide some insight in to existing patterns of income and
expenditure in relation to the sector, there will be a need in the future to assess the benefits
and costs accruing to various sector development programmes much more precisely. In
particular the degree of impact on the poorer, disadvantaged sections of the community will
need to be more closely defined. To be able to do this using a consistent data set, potentially
over an extended period of time will require a far better data set than is at present available
from one off project related surveys.
* Public Health and Economic Costs and Benefits
The comment above on income and expenditure profiles applies in a wider context to the data
required to estimate the potential costs and benefits. Of perhaps most significance here is the
inability to relate medical record data to a place of residence and work / school attendance.
While there will always be extreme difficulty from a practical and theoretical perspective to
establish causal linkages between incidence of ill health and geographic areas, such data is
often of prime importance in quantifyting the potential benefits of a project.

5.        PROJECT IMPACTS
5.1       INTRODUCTION
This Section provides an overview of defined project impacts. These are assessed as:
Typical Impacts: i.e. impacts that may be attributable to a greater or lesser extent to both
project types. These are outlined in Section 5.2.
Sections 5.3 and 5.4 identify the impacts that are either related only to Sanitation or Water
Supply Projects or which are of particular significance in either context. In all cases impacts
are defined under one of four categories:
* Pre construction
* Construction Impacts; (temporary, off site and resource consumption)
* Permanent Impacts
* Operational Impacts
Induced, or indirect impacts are relatively minor and are considered under operational impacts.
The final section, 5.5 comprises a summary of impacts. In this context, while no differentiation
is made between sanitation project components in the text, the collection system or the trunk
main, clear distinctions are made in the summary tabulations.
5.2       TYPICAL IMPACTS
5.2.1     Pre Construction
There are only two aspects of project preparation to consider.
-    confirmation of the right to access lands for survey purposes, (topographic and subsoil),
-    subsoil investigation pits.
Neither is considered likely to be a source of major impacts, provided reasonable health and
safety measures are taken in the digging of the pits (which are not likely to exceed 6.5m)
5.2.2     Construction Works (Temnorarv)
Public Safety
During the construction phase, there may be an increased risk of accidents involving local
populations, especially children. These may result from one or a combination of the following:
-     unauthorised access to a construction site.
-     an absence of control over access to construction sites,
-     conflict with construction vehicles,
-     poor site safety,
-     inadequate site management.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services        Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
By their very nature construction activities generate elevated levels of accident risk. However,
three factors suggest that the impacts from these projects may be further increased:
* it is evident that a number of construction sites in Yemen lack proper management and in
some cases are clearly dangerous and equally importantly that off site activities, such as
construction traffic, are as poorly controlled.
* widespread construction within the urban area. Extensive linear construction sites along
urban streets will expose large sections of the population, especially children who use
streets as play areas, to risk.
* the nature of the urban development is such that access routes for construction traffic will
be poor; often comprising relatively narrow streets and lanes with no pedestrian facilities,
blind corners etc.
Noise and Construction Disturbance
During site preparation and construction, noise will be generated from a number of sources
including: jack hanmmers, excavators, payloaders, generators, etc. and in many instances these
will be operating in immediate proximity to residential areas.
Certain levels of noise disturbance are unavoidable. In excess, however, they can be a nuisance
to neighbouring residents and, in extreme cases, can become a health hazard to workers and
residents. Typically, operational noise will be broad-band but intermittent, and is in a wide
range from 5OdB(A) (non-operation) to 90+dB(A) as indicated in Table 5.1.

Note: Distance between observer and machinexy
From this it is clear that without exception night operations wil exceed standards and day
operations are uniformly excessive up to 20m. It is therefore inevitable, without mitigation,
that significant disturbance will be experienced by a substantial element of the population.
Air Quality
Unmanaged air pollution, especially of particulate and gaseous emissions from construction
machinery may create nuisance and in extreme cases direct adverse health impacts or damage
to property. However while some impacts can be expected throughout Project areas, the
quantity and nature of the machinery to be used is such that these impacts need not be severe.

Construction traffic may potentially generate substantial quantities of dust in and around active
construction areas and on some of the unpaved access roads. This issue is linked to that of
heavy traffic use and access and safety on minor roads within the city.
It is also possible that off site facilities, in particular aggregate processing plants, may generate
sufficient dust to be of nuisance.
Waste Material
The alluviums in which the greater majority of the project works will be constructed will
contain horizons that are unsuited for use either as selected pipe bedding (contains material of
> 100 mm diameter) or backfill (plasticity index greater than 6%).
These materials will need to be carted away and disposed of appropriately and suitable
replacement materials brought in.
Hydrogeology
The groundwaters of the area may be affected by:
* Contamination of groundwater from minor spillage at contractor camps (septic tank and
leachate from trash and solid waste) or construction materials on site.
* Disturbances in soil physical properties may temporarily increase chances of seepages of
faecal material and other contaminants into groundwater.
* Increased potential mnixing of contaminated surface flows with those of the shallow aquifer/
water table
These imrpacts are however not expected to be significant. The construction sites will not be
deep enough to reach the groundwaters. Dewatering is therefore unlikely to be required and
mixing of waters precluded. The risk of release of hazardous materials' is minimal and the
additional load negligible in the context of that released by cesspits.
Fauna, Flora and Ecology
The wholly' urban context of the projects is likely to ensure that the threat of destruction of
habitats and associated displacement of fauna will be negligible. There are therefore
considered to be no direct impacts on the region's ecology from project works and almost
certainly no loss of biodiversity.
No hazardous materials are directly specified for use in the Bid Documents for the Sanitaton Projects.
However the water supply project will require flushing and disinfection of pipes using Calcium or Sodium
Hypochlorite or Chlorine, (see Section 5.4.2 . These materials, if spilt in bulk quantity, may have a very
short-term adverse impact on local groundwater quality, but no adverse consequences are anticipated.  r
2 There are no parks, green spaces or other possible refuge sites such as wadis that are directly affected by
Prject works.

Archaeology/Cultural Heritage
The principal heritage and cultural values of the study area lie in occasional isolated examples
of traditional architecture. However, no sites of specific scientific, cultural or heritage
significance were identified that may be directly affected by Project works3. The rich cultural
and archaeological heritage of the old city is entirely unaffected by project works.
Moreover, virtually all project activities will occur within existing rights of way that have
already been subject to development. It is considered very unlikely therefore that any buried
site will be encountered in construction.
Off Site Works
Five types of off site facility may be developed to support the project:
(i)    Project offices
Project offices may located anywhere within Sana'a in any number of available existing
buildings and will generate no adverse impacts. Temporary, site offices may be established but
these will not be large and can be easily established and provided with necessary facilities at
little or no local impact.
(ii)    Materials Stockpiles
The Bid Documents indicate that the Client will provide a site for materials stockpiles. This
site is not yet identified, but may be at the client's headquarters site in Hasabah. The materials
for stockpile at this (or other defined) site will be exclusively non-hazardous and should not
require application of any exceptional handling and storage measures.
(iii)   Pre-Fabrication Yard
Elements for over 800 manholes will need to be pre cast off site. A yard will therefore be
required to store cement, chemicals (primarily oils) for the moulds, moulds and for pre
fabrication. It will require access to adequate water supplies and immediate access to suitable
(for heavy traffic) roads.
It is possible that these works will be undertaken by a sub contractor (or the contractor) at an
existing facility. It is however equally likely that they will be carnied out at a new site.
Possible adverse iinpacts may include: soil contamination, increased accident risk from heavy
truck movements and possible modification to local water resource availability. The quantity
of water required is not excessive, but given the severe constraints on available local supplies
the actual location of the yard may interfere with water availability to surrounding properties.
3 Only the areas of Akamah and Hasaah have been subject to summy rmew in this contxt Further
reviews of the remaining areas will be required once design works are finalised.

(iv)   Equipment Maintenance and Cleaning
As with the prefabrication yard, it is possible that contractor will utilise locally available
suppliers for equipment and lease equipment as required. In such cases there will be no need
for the creation of a new maintenance yard.
However, should the contractor wish to establish a new facility, the major threat would be the
pollution of groundwater resources from  the industrial waste will be generated by the
maintenance and cleaning activities. Of particular concern is the disposal of wastewater from
the cleaning of equipment since such water will contain pollutants. At a minimum, industrial
strength detergents and oil cleaning solvents.
There will, in addition, be a potential risk of pollution from the accidental spillage of, and, or
leakage from, industrial materials stored on site. The nature and significance of the threat to
water resources cannot be determined at this stage, without full knowledge of the materials to
be stored.
(v)    Borrow Material and Aggregate Washing and Screening
Substantial quantities of borrow material and Aggregates will need to be obtained and made
suitable for use on site. This issue is discussed in greater detail in Section 5.3.2.
At all off site facilities it will be important that contractors maintain and manage sites to high
standards, that health and safety regulations are in force, that appropriate means for waste
control and disposal are applied and that all temporary project sites are cleaned up and made
good. Possible residual wastes of concern at each facility are as follows:
Waste Material  Source              Impact Type I Environment Affected
Spent oils      Maintenance yard    Imnediate temporary contamination: Shallow aquifer, Soil,
Batteries                           Long tenn persistent contamination: Soil and water,
Scrap metals                        Long term persistent: Soil and water

Surplus fill    Construction Site(s)   Variable / Unsightly, Safety concern, esp. children. Urban.
Spent oils      Mainenance Yard    Immediate temporary contamination: Shallow aquifer, Soil
Access and Construction Traffic
All points of contact between heavy construction traffic and existing traffic will be a potential
source of accidents. Three factors will contribute to this:
-  the increased number of turning movements of heavy construction traffic gaining access
to, and exiting from, the primary road
the relatively low speed of the construction traffic, and the mixing of traffic types and
speed
the possibility of damage to-the road surface from the increased level of heavy traffic
and, more likely, modification of road surface conditions by mud, chippings, surface oil
and other foreign matter.
Y9701                                                                         M 5.5r- ach 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services       Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
Access to the construction sites, which may require the use of local access roads that would
generally not be considered suitable for use by heavy vehicles will also be a potential source of
concern. Use by construction traffic of such roads may cause damage to the road surface or in
other cases to structures, delays to non-construction traffic and increased risk of accidents.
For off site facilities where some choice in siting is available, direct access to the primary net-
work should be a major criteria in location.
5.2.3     Permanent Impacts
All the project components are noteworthy for having:
* no requirement for additional land acquisition
* no requirement for property take
* no requirement for population relocation or resettlement
* no requirement for impacts on cultural heritage
All works will be carried out within existing public rights of way.
Similarly, with one minor exception (cesspit cleaning operations discussed in Section 5.3.3
below), there will be almost no productive loss, loss of employment or other loss of income
from project actions.
There is therefore no requirement for the definition of compensation rights and policies
beyond those that may be applied for damage done to property and assets during construction
work.
5.2.4     Operational Impacts
There are a few adverse or positive operational impacts common to both projects, and those
that do occur are of sufficient significance to warrant detailed attention in each Project Case
5.3       SANITATION PROJECTS
5.3.1     Pre Construction
There are no pre construction impacts additional to those defined in Section 5.2.1 above.
5.3.2     Construction Impacts (Temporary)
Five areas of activity that may generate potentially significant inpacts are reviewed below.
(i)    Cesspit Removal
In total, project components are estimated to require the closure, excavation, fill and
stabilisation of a potential maximum 7,100 cesspits (2,900 in Akamah, 1,800 in Sawad
Hanash, 1,500 in Safiyah East and 900 in Saba'een). The actual number may be as low as

Sanaa Water Supply and Sanitation Services          Sana a 1 Environmental Impact Assessment
3,500 (1,500 in Akamah). These actions will bring with them a number of potentially
significant impacts.
* The general threat to public health from the opening of a pit
Some of these pits are deep, 20 m+, (though an average of 15 m is expected) and lie within
public rights of way. Each individual pit, when opened, will therefore be a source of potential
hazard to all uses of that right of way.
It is also common in Sana'a for children to be seen playing around recently dug cesspit holes
and more especially on the mounds of excavated earth. These mounds are both unstable and
unsanitary. The specific nature of any materials to be excavated from around active pits is
unknown but they will undoubtedly pose a much greater health hazard than that excavated for
new sites, with children in particular at risk.
* Nuisance (and potential health effects) from the extreme odour of the open pits.
The nature of the works suggest that nuisance values, especially from odour (and potentially
health concerns), will be high and will be experienced by residents, land users and road users
alike.
* The removal and disposal of waste materials from cesspits.
All (non-solid) materials in existing cesspits will need to be removed and carted away to a
point of safe disposal. Operators of desludgers and other workers in the immediate environs of
the operation will be at some risk from contact with the material and thus at some health risk.
Although some 7,100 pits are expected to be cleared over the project duration the major
concern is over the waste from the 2,900 pits from the Akamah Project. (i.e. prior to
completion and operation of the new WWTP). Nevertheless, the total quantity of material
involved is expected to be quite significant, (say as a worst case 90 m3 per day for a 14-month
period, Table 5.2) and much of this material will be extremely aggressive. It will be anaerobic
and potentially very acidic. It may therefore have a strong adverse impact if disposed of
directly to existing, main or interceptor sewers, or directly to the environment.
Contract documentation requires that for the first four months of the construction period the
materials collected are transferred to the sump of the raw sewage inlet pump at the existing
treatment plant, where it is to be discharged. After this period, the new WWTP is expected to
be operational.
In these circumstances, assuming that the pits contain a volume waste of around half that in
the calculation in Table 5.2, removal would require two trucks for Akamah rising to a fleet of
five for the other contracts.
In the worst-case scenario, it is assumed that 90 mn3 per day of sewage will result in 9,000 ti3
over the four months that will be discharged into the existing WWTP, which equates to a
maximum additional load of 1.5% of design capacity of 6,000 n3. This will be released directly
into the input sump of the WWTP during off-peak hours (i.e. at night), when the plant is not
operating at full capacity.

may wish to open up new sites at as yet undetermined location(s). Should they do so a wide
range of impacts can be expected.
-     greatly elevated noise levels
-     dust emissions in processing and from stockpiles
-     water consumption
-     wastewater
-     introduction of additional heavy traffic on roads accessing the site, etc.
Provided the site(s) developed are relatively remote from residential areas and can be easily
secured these impacts are all readily manageable. Post operation the contractor will however
be required to make good the site.
Transportation of the materials could be a major problem. Assuming a 7m3 tipper truck

(ii)   The  collection, handling  and  disposal of waste  generated  by  households
disconnected from their disposal system.
This is another potentially problematic issue even though it is anticipated that no more than
three trenches will be open at any one time and that each trench will be open for a niaximum
of one hundred metres (assumed maximum distance between manholes).
Nevertheless, assuming a plot/structure frontage of 25 m and 4 households per frontage, a
system of temporary sewage collection and disposal will be required to be in place for up to 16
families, say 1 10 persons, throughout the construction period.
The volumes dealt with are quite small4, at a minimum, around 4.5 m3/day and the maximum,
9.7 m3/day but the systems must be in place and it is in the maintenance and management of
operation of those systems that the problems may lie. It will be unacceptable for any raw
domestic sewage to be discharged (or escape) in the public domain.
(iii)  Inappropriate Disposal of Waste Materials
Associated with elements of (i) and (ii) is the problem of fly dumping;. Much of the above
discussion has highlighted the scale of the wastewater, slurry and sludge evacuation
programme required and indirectly the costs (fleet operations) of that operation. Under these
circumstances there is a potential (official and unofficial) for materials to dumped at sites other
than those defined.
Such dumping, (especially of slurry and sludge) will have the potential to cause extensive
damage to virtualy any environment to which it is discharged, particularly if it is permitted for
an extended period. In all cases such dumping will pose a serious health hazard.
Strict controls wiDl therefore be required to ensure that this does not occur.
(iv)   Use of Wastewaters
Farmners are at present using a substantial quantity of waste material available from the WWTP
site, including the sludge and waters. While they use these materials in the knowledge that they
are essentially 'not healthful' neither they nor the authorities are able to determine precisely
the threats posed. Nevertheless their use is accepted practice and it must be assumed that the
risk associated with this is accepted.
However, if the cesspit waste leads to a significant change in that risk, (more heavily
contaminated materials in greater concentration) problems may occur. These may apply both
4 At a design return rate of 36.8 I/cId, (46 ]/cld @ 0.8 return factor) this equates to 4.6 m3/day in total and at
the maximum average domestic consumption rate of 110 V/c/d (for private piped networks) identified in the
SWSS, 9.7 m3/day. No allowance is made for non-domestic consumption on the assumption that we are
dealing with the direct consumption of the properties affected. In this case they are all assumed to be
residences of 4 households and with 7 persons per household.
5 Fly dumping is the illegal disposal of waste materials at a site other than that designated or approved as
suitable for receiving that material. In efect, it is the casual disposal of materials at a site of convenience
rather than an approved site.

to direct users, and potentially secondary and tertiary handlers and users of products
generated.
(v)    Soil Contamination
It is clear that the soils of much of the construction area are contaminated by wastewater. This
contamination will be manifest in two ways:
-     through alteration of the chemical make up of the soils; increased acidity or alkalinity
-     by the presence of pathogens (and nuisance odours) in the excavated material
It is understood that in both cases the contamination is not self-perpetuating. It is reversible
and the reversion process will begin inimediately the source of contamination is removed.
The chemical process will be slower.
Given the above, no long term threat to pipe integrity is expected. Similarly, there is not
expected to be a (abnormal) need to stabilise, or replace soils in the work corridors that have
been affected by exfiltrating waters.
The primary concern will therefore be to the Public Health of anyone exposed to the materials.
Although pathogens once exposed to the air and temperature would be expected to die off
within 72 hours, at most 96 hours, the issue of exposure (especially of the workforce) to
contaminated soils during these periods is of concem.
(vi)   Access and Traffic Disruption
D Property Access
Access to all properties in areas to be served by the project will be adversely affected at some
point in the construction period. In most cases these impacts will be minor, restricted both in
their severity and duration by the narrowness of the trenches required for the relatively small
diameter of the pipes being laid.
However, in cases where construction work is slated to take place in the immediate vicinity of
special sites, (schools mosques and such like,) or other Public Buildings specific access issues
will be raised.
* Traffic Disruption
For larger pipes (>500mm) these impacts will be far greater, magnified by the potential depth
of the construction works and their duration. These pipes by their nature, also tend to be laid
in main roads or secondary roads of functional importance to local and urban wide road
networks.
In these cases, potentially severe impacts on traffic circulation (delays etc.), local access and
plot access, can be expected with impacts resulting not only from a loss of road space as a
direct result of the construction site but also to construction traffic, loading and unloading,
parking etc. The areas and roads most likely to be severely affected are shown on Figure 5.1.

The quantities of trucks that may be at each site (see 5.3.2) are such however that quite
extensive waiting areas (adequate for 5 to 10 vehicles) could be needed. In most small
neighbourhood streets this will require their closure. For secondary roads there may be a need
for additional closure and diversion over relatively small distances, say 200m or less. On
primary roads, the probable scope of ongoing works will be such that it is unlikely that vehicle
waiting areas will add to required traffic control measures.
(vii) Wadi Sailah
Wadi Sailah runs north - south through Sana'a, passing in the vicinity of the existing WWTP,
Figure 5.2. It is proposed to use the wadi as an alignment for two mains utilised in the Safiyah
East and Saba'een Projects (part of the Long-term Program).
The 1978 Master Plan proposed to lay out a park along the entire (planned) urban stretch of
the Wadii but this has not happened. Further studies in 1995 and 1996 stressed the significance
of Wadi Sailah to the urban ecology of Sana'a and recommended a further project to protect it
from a variety of developmental problems. These concerns were highlighted in Section 4.2.4
and summarised in Table 4.2. The pipelines of Sections 8 and 9 (Figure 5.2) are currently
under construction under the MOPD project
Table 5.3 identifies a number of, often related, concerns that would be associated with project
works in sections 6 and 7 as shown in Figure 5.2.

5.3.3     Operations Phase
In this sub-section both negative and positive Project impacts are defined. Potential negative
impacts from the Operational Phase are reviewed under four broad headings:
* Use of Existing Lines
* Use of the Existing Treatment Plant
* Hydrogeology
* Social Impacts
Project Benefits are discussed as Direct, or Non Attributable benefits.
(i)    Use of Existing Sewer Lines
Project designs call for the connection of the new networks to elements of the existing sewer
system. Such cases are located on Figure 5.3. Project specifications do not call for the
replacement of these lengths of sewer line or for any form of works other than connection.
This is understood to result from discussions with NWSA, who consider the existing lines to
be fundamentally sound. However, there is no physical evidence available that these pipes are
sound and in the absence of inspection data and or regular maintenance records, is possible
that either:
-     Pipes in the ground are not sized as reported and are too small to accept the design
flow, or
- -   Pipes are damaged to the extent that may suffer excess leakage, or more likely,
blockage, with consequent backfiow effects and flooding.
The former case is considered most unlikely. All pipes to which the new systems are to be
connected were located from 'As Built' drawings certified by a reputable International
Engineering Consultancy.
The latter case is more likely and may occur with resulting severe, but generally localised,
flooding impacts. This is more an issue with regard to the main interceptors. The Sector
Development Plan (SDP) contains a recommendation for a project to rehabilitate thirty-five
km of interceptors, (which are only 10 to 12 years old), subject to confirmation through
CCTV inspection.
(ii)   Use of Treatment Plant
The phasing of Sector development works is such that wastewater will be collected and
transported to the existing WWTP during the first four months of the construction period.
Following this period the new WWTP will be operational.
This plant comprises six stabilisation ponds and was initially designed for an inflow of
6,000 m3 per day. -It now receives some 15,600 m3 per day. Appendix C presents a situation
analysis of the plant and a mitigation plan.
Two standby generators to supply power to the inlet pumps during periods of blackout are out
of order and are in urgent need of repair or replacement.

Assuming:
-     The IDA credit becomes effective July 1, 1999
-     Two months needed for contractor mobilisation, therefore Akamah construction starts
September 1.
-     New WWTP becomes operational December, 1999, therefore additional sewage will
be emptied into existing WWTP during four months of the 18 month construction
period.
-     Maximum of 2,900 cesspits in Akamah to be demolished (1,500 estimated), 600 of
which could potentially be demolished during the four month period.
-     15 m3 of sewage per cesspit demolished will result in 9,000 m3 over the four months,
or 90 m3/day, calculated on the basis of 25 working days per month.
-     I'otal assumed (worst case) production 9,000 m3 discharged into existing WWTP,
which equates to a maximum additional load of 1.5 % of design capacity of 6,000 m3
These wastes will be discharged directly into the inlet sump of the existing WWTP during this
initial four months of the construction phase. It is therefore expected that the impact of the
additional load will be minimal.
There is no site within the defined project areas that is known to be producing effluent that is
hazardous or which would be a source of specific concem. Accordingly adverse impacts will
be restricted to those that would typically be attributed to domestic wastewater.
Once completed the new WWTP will have ample capacity to accommodate all projected flows
(Table 5.4) and will treat waters to desired standards.

The new WWTP is designed for an average flow of 50,000 m3/day (580 lls). The peak design
flow is 1,740 I/s. The plant is designed, based on analysis of raw sewage, for the following
influent characteristics:

SS      750 mg/l
NH4      100 mgl

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
The treatment process (activated sludge) will result in the effluent having BOD better than
30 mg/ and SS better than 30 mg/I, which is within the WHO guidelines for general crop
irrigation7.
The new WWTP will produce 80 tonnes per day of dried sludge at a moisture content of 30%,
when operating at full capacity. Initially, the plant will be operating at around 40% capacity,
producing approximately 32 tonnes per day. The sludge will largely be stabilised by aerobic
digestion within the activated sludge plant and will be given further treatment by thickening
and drying on beds before storage/composting for six months in a sludge storage area. The
treatment and storage processes will render the sludge essentially free of pathogens. A review
of impact, extracted from the new WWTP Design Report and Review of Impact, is presented
in Appendix D. Dried sludge will be sold to farmers, as is the practice in the current pond
WWTP. A formal wastewater and sludge reuse study will be performed and financed as part
of the project.
(iii) Hydrogeology
Large scale leakage during project operations may promote localised raising of water tables
which could adversely affect the function of existing percolation pits in unsewered areas on the
periphery of the new systems, promoting overflow, mixing of waters and contaminating
shallow aquifer. Rising water tables may also pose a long-term threat to building foundations.
However such concerns are unlikely to be of significance. They will be highly localised and not
widespread as at present and may be readily dealt with on a case by case basis as they occur. If
systems are not maintained, some increase in intensity of impact (even over present levels)
may be experienced at localised sites of system failure.
(iv)   Social Impacts
* Migration and Social Organisation
The preparation, construction and operation of the projects is unlikely to generate adverse
impacts from in-migration to Sana'a or, specifically, to the project areas as:
-     there will be little or no requirement to import labour for the project.
-     though improved sanitary conditions may increase the attractiveness of the
areas for development they will not encourage large-scale relocation of populations
either within or to the Sana'a urban area.
* Income and Employment
With no property or productive land take the only losses in income and employment will be to
those limited number of private contractors that have been providing cesspit clearance services
to local residents. The losses incurred are estimated in the ESS (for Sawad Hanash and
Akamah) at about $90,000 per annum or $2.00 per capita.

These costs will be incurred by very few individuals. Moreover, while the projects will clearly
have a short-term impact on business they will not entirely eliminate demand.
(v)    Development Constraints
The project is unlikely to significantly alter existing patterns of development directly though it
is conceivable that modifications to land values (see Housing and Urban Development in (vi)
below) and potential future pressures on the available quantity of serviced land will stimulate a
change in the land use pattern of the improved areas.8
However, the design specifications utilised are based on existing general patterns of use and
are the product of a need to balance service provision against costs. Thus while they will
accommodate some very limited intensification of land use and hence rates of water use they
will not cope with radical changes.
Maximum estimated capacities expressed in terms of system throughput are as indicated in
Table 5.5.

The relevant authorities may therefore be required to ensure, through the application of
available regulations (or newly defined development control regulations), that land use
patterns and thus projected patterns of water consumption remain within the specified Project
design parameters. In this context, therefore the project may have some limiting effect on land
use development patterns.
s Depending on the eventual Sector Development Plan adopted it is possible that there will be differential
levels of service provided by the public water supply system. This will clearly modify relative land values
and reduce the availble quantum of fully serviced land in the future. By definition, under these policies
sewered areas will be targeted to receive the mamum target supply level of 80Vtc/d. They will therefore be
among the most attractive development areas of the city.

(vi)   Direct Project Benefits
The design horizon for the Project is year 2020. The total projected population served by the
Sanitation project is around 106,500. These populations will gain a number of directly related
benefits as follows:
* Public Health Improvements
The ESS household Survey (of Akamah and Sawad Hanash) results indicate that over 60% of
respondents believed that tap water was contaminated by sewerage and that 12% actively took
measures at cost (filtering) to counter the perceived contamination. In addition more than one
third of households boiled water on a daily basis (excluding boiling in the preparation of food
and beverages).
It is not possible to state definitively at this time whether the perception of contamination is
correct9 or, whether or not any contaminant source will be removed by the Project. However
it may be expected that after project construction, households previously concerned about
contamination will perceive the threat diminished, if not removed, and reduce or eliminate
their preventative expenditure. Clearly this is only a benefit if the water is in fact not
contaminated and households do not later regret their decision not undertake precautionary
measures.
- Income and Employment
Secondary employment opportunities generated by a growth in the local informal and formal
sectors of the economy, most notably in the commercial sectors that will stem from the
improved physical environment of affected areas and the reduction in the proportion of
household expenditure on sanitation.
At present, degraded sanitary conditions are claimed by local business owners to seriously
impact turnover. In areas prone to sewage flooding turnover is reported to decline by 60-90%
during flood events.
* Housing and Urban Development
-     Land and Property Values
Though land and property markets in Yemen are ill developed and may not be that responsive
to changes in urban environmental quality, some increase in land and property values may be
expected from Project generated relief.
Realtors interviewed in the preparation of the ESS suggest that property values may rise by
30-50% as a direct consequence of the project and undeveloped land by as much as 50-100%.
This view is to some extent supported by the householders themselves. Some 400/%o
9 Water put in the system by NWSA is clean but whether or not it is contaminated when received by
consumers is unknown. Tests on tap water collected at the timc. aE the ESS showed no significant
contamination.

considered connection to a sewage network would substantially increase property values, and
the average benefit defined by those able to give a value (63% of the 40%), averaged just over
50%.
-     Reduced Protective Expenditure
It is argued that further benefits are likely to be obtained from the reduction in household
repairs and or protective works (against sewage inflow). Approximately 25% of households in
Akamah and Sawad Hanash claimed to have spent money either protecting their property
against incursion or in repairs to damage done. The estimated total value of the works was put
at just over $200,000.
* Wastewater Tariffs
Against these benefits should be set the increase in costs for Sanitation Services. At present
NWSA charge a flat rate fee of YR 5,000 ($38.46) for household connections to the sewage
network. Tariffs to be introduced in December 1998 are as in Table 5.6.

(vii) Non Attributable Benefits
There are also likely to be a number of benefits derived beyond those directly attributable to
local populations: These will include:
* Reduced pavement damage and thus reduced VOCs and road maintenance costs;
* Tourism potential: The tourism sector in Yemen has grown rapidly in recent years and is
now worth some $50million per annum mostly in hard currencies. These would be virtually
eliminated by a major health scare, or epidemic.

5.4.2     Construction Phase
In general, the impacts of construction activities for the water supply project will be less
severe than those for the Sewage Projects. Trenches are shallower and narrower, and pipes
smaller. Impacts on road users will also be less severe with the greater majority of works
confined to local neighbourhoods. Therefore, in addition to having less overall effect, adverse
impacts will be more keenly felt by those directly benefiting from the project and will be made
the more tolerable for being so.
Perhaps most significantly there will be no requirement for cesspit clearance. A programme to
sewer the entire project area has recently been completed and all cesspits dug out and
stabilised. There is nonetheless one area of potential concern: system flushing and disinfection.
Flushing and Disinfection
The contract documents require that the contractor flush and disinfect pipe systems. They
further specify:
-     Use of one of: Calcium or Sodium Hypochlorite, or Chlorine Gas
-     Dosage rates
-     Residual concentrations of after first flush
-     Maximum residual after second flush
These requirements introduce a number of possible areas of concern.
(i)    Storage and Use of Materials
All three materials are potentially hazardous. They can
-     cause very severe external damage to all who come into contact with them
-     cause death if ingested (or inhaled )
-     cause substantial damage to all component elements of physical environments, plant
life, fauna, and especially micro-organisms
The potential threat posed by the use of these materials is summarised in Table 5.7 for each of
the stages of the use process.
A further factor that would apply to all aspects of Table 5.7 (except fly dumping) is the speed
and the adequacy of the response to an event. Prompt effective actio-n would in most cases
effectively eliminate adverse impacts and in the few remaining instances would minimise the
severity of the impacts.
(ii)   Disposal of Wastewaters
The waters utilised in this process will contain significant quantities of residual chlorine, in
concentrations of not less than Sppm after the first flushing, and not more than Ippm on the
final flush. While these waters will not pose a significant threat to human health, they will not
be suitable for consumption, and as such will need to be disposed of in a manner that precludes
local populations accessing even residual quantities.

The wastes will however be toxic to a wide variety of organisms and highly destructive to
many micro-environments, a factor that should be considered in their disposal.
(iii) Resource Use
In addition to the above flushing and disinfection (and pressure testing) would impose very
short and highly localised, but nonetheless potentially significant, water resource demands on
local networks.
5.4.3     Operations Phase
(i)    Existing System
The existing networks, both official and unofficial, in place across much of the project area
will potentially generate a number of concerns.
* Firstly, wherever possible normal" supplies to existing users will have to be maintained,
throughout the construction period.
Water supply provision from the public system in Sana'a is already poor and the cost of
alternative supply sources high (at least for guaranteed clean water) Accordingly, extended
periods of supply loss may impose substantial costs on affected households, financially,
physically and socially.
There are however no compelling reasons for such impacts to occur. Contract documents
require existing supply provision to be maintained and there is nothing in the nature of the
existing system or the development proposals that should make such it difficult for any
contractor to meet this obligation.
* Secondly, although there is a requirement for existing systems and new systems to be
isolated and although existing cesspits have been removed there is a slight risk of (cross)
contamination. Accordingly, care must be taken that elements of the existing system are not
left around after completion of the works or that some households or blocks of houses are
left unconnected.
* Thirdly, all existing consumers must be guaranteed connection to the new network. No
reduction in existing access to piped water, (whether legal or illegal) would be an
acceptable impact.
* Finally, while it is expected that the ad hoc systems will be isolated from supply, every
effort should be made to ensure that these do not simply reappear. It may be, for example,
that while many people welcome the project and the improved service it will bring, there
will be a number who do not want to pay for water.
" Normal in this context implies that the areas in question should recive their theoretical typical supply
pattern of the last few years, during construction. They should not be further disadvantaged.

(ii)   Wastewater Generation
Though there can be no doubt of the benefit from increased available water supplies to a
population they also bring about an associated increase in the quantity of wastewater
generated'2.
Though the entire project area has recently been sewered (works completed in May 1997), this
has particularly important consequences in that it will place significant additional load on
already inadequate waste disposal systems, further increasing the potential for downstream
environrental damage prior to the completion of the new WWTP (see Section 5.3.3 (ii)
above).
(iii) Cross Contamination
The recent sewering of the area will ensure that the expected rise in the level of wastewater
generation will not cause problems of cesspit overflow as is common throughout many areas
of the city at present. Accordingly, the risk of cross cont,amination will be markedly reduced
from present levels even under conditions of relatively poor maintenance assuming that the
design requirements for separation are maintained in construction.
5.5 SUMMARY OF PROJECT IMPACTS
Table 5.8 provides an overview of Project Impacts.
12 This will stem from an increase in the area covered by the supply network but also increased individual
rates of consumption. Present levels of consumption are not known buLi= believedtj.be of the order of
1,400 m3/day. Once completed the project is assumed to supply as a minimum 2,200 m3/day. Total
generation of wastewater will increase from 1,100 m3/day to 1,750 m3/day.

6.        MMTIGATION PLAN
6.1       INTRODUCTION
The remaining sections of this report, Sections 6 and 7, contain the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) for the Project.
This Section outlines the Mitigation Plan. In general terms, it comprises the three elements
outlined in Sections 6.2 to 6.4:
-     Consultation Programme (Section 6.2)
-     Measures to be adopted for the Sanitation Projects (Section 6.3). These include the
general guidelines for construction activities (on site and off site) and the specific
measures proposed in response to the impacts of concern outlined in Section 5. Given
the substantially different status of the various sanitation projects, the emphasis in this
section is on the mitigation of impacts directly associated with the Akamah Project that
may be applied in all subsequent project components'.
-     Specific mitigation requirements related to the Hasabah Water Supply Project, that are
additional to those outlined for the Sanitation Projects, Section 6.4.
Section 6.5 contains a tabular summary of the Mitigation Plan in the context of the impacts
defined in the previous section.
6.2    CONSULTATION PROGRAMME
6.2.1     Proarammes
Despite the fact that this type of category "B" environmental project does not require a public
consultation program, the Government of Yemen has nevertheless implemented an extensive
program of public awareness and consultation. This program comprises three components: (i)
public meetings; (ii) newspaper and television articles and programs; and (iii) household
surveys. Each of these is summarised below, and details are included in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
(i)    Public Meetings
To date there have been 4 public meetings about the project. The first was on July 26 1997,
and the latest took place on February 20 1999. Another meeting is scheduled before the start
of construction, and further meetings are planned during the construction period. On average,
these public meetings are attended by about 30 to 35 people living in the affected
neighbourhoods. Topics discussed typically include the deterioration of sewerage conditions,
the duration of construction, and the number of households served.
At this time, there are no characteriscs or conditions associated vwth other Sanitation project components
that would suggest additional, or special measures beyond those defined for Akamah, need be developecL

(ii)   Newspaper and Television Coverage
To date, there have been 5 newspaper articles about the project. The first appeared on May
22, 1998, and the most recent was on November 16, 1998. In general, the articles discuss
sewerage problems, what the project will do to alleviate these problems, and reports on the
status of the project. On October 25, 1997, the PITJ Director for the Project, among others,
were on a live television programme, discussing potential impacts of the projects' works, and
answering questions on how to facilitate the construction process.

Results of the surveys show that households consider street flooding from cesspit overflow to
be the most important environmental consideration in their neighbourhoods. The Project plans
a follow-up survey in the Akamah and Hasabah areas halfway through its implementation
period, which is estimated to be one year after the sewage network has been completed.
6.2.2     Affected Population Rights
This will apply in three areas:
(i)    Rights to compensation for property/assets damaged during project construction
Information will be provided on the following:
under normal circumstances, what compensation may be payable for?
the compensation procedure:
to whom a claim must be addressed
how the claim must be prepared and what is required
who will review the claim and assess its validity or otherwise
who will assess the value of the claim
where appeals against either the original findings or the claim may be lodged
which office will make initial judgement on appeal.
the legal process that may be followed if the internal project process does not provide
satisfaction.

(ii)   Rights to complain about actions taken by any party in the construction process,
including complaints about noise, dust, pollution etc.
As with compensation, communities shall be informed of the options they have available to
complain about contractor/ NWSA actions. This will include a description of:
-     to whom a complaint must be addressed.
-     who will review the complaint and what their options are.
-     the time frame in which action, if any, may be expected.
-     to which office they may make further complaint if the problem remains unresolved.
(iii) Rights to receive the services provided
It is important that all members of the community in the Project areas are entitled to the same
minimum standard of service. It will not be acceptable for some members of the community to
receive no, or less than the minimum, service.
It will be necessary therefore for specific details of project entitlements to be made available to
all members of the public. In addition it will be necessary to inform the public what
mechanisms are available to them for ensuring they receive the minimum service. As above,
i.e.
-     to whom a complaint must be addressed.
-     who will review the complaint and what their options are.
-.    the time frame in which action, if any, may be expected.
-     to which office they may make further complaint if the problem remains unresolved.
In each of the above cases the information required will be provided in written form and
verbally at Project community meetings.
Pamphlets will be provided to each affected household prior to commencement of civic works
and will be available at the Project Office. The pamphlets will be prepared by the PMU and
supervising engineer, and will give general information to affected communities. Television
and radio advertisements will also be utilised, as well as newspaper articles.
Community leaders, NGOs and others will be invited to attend Project Meetings as required
during which they will be provided with the literature and explanations of its content. These
groups will be expected to disseminate this information through all the channels open to them.
6.3       SANITATION PROJECTS
6.3.1     Pre Construction
There is no requirement for mitigation works during the Pre-construction Phase.

6.3.2     Construction On Site
(i)    General
Appendix E to this report provides broad guidelines for good construction practice that may
be included if required in potential contract negotiations. Adherence to these guidelines would
largely eliminate the majority of construction related impacts.
The following text therefore addresses only those issues that are of particular concern for the
projects assessed, or which are not usually encountered in the construction process.
(ii)   Public Safety
The major public health (and safety) concerns are addressed below. However there are a
number of measures that could be undertaken on site to limit the risk of an accident involving
the public.
-     trenches should be open for as little time as possible.
-     appropriate trench crossing facilities should be provided in sufficient number to permit
safe crossing of trenches to gain access to private properties.
appropriate alternative pedestrian routes, that separate pedestrians from road traffic,
should be provided. Where restrictions in roadway space are such that the risk of
pedestrian - vehicular conflict is significantly heightened, temporary closure of the
access may be considered.
-     use of temporary fences to isolate the deeper (>3m) trenches.
-     the use of all heavy and mobile equipment shall be strictly controlled with all drivers
and operators required to be licensed and all heavy equipment operated in strict
accordance with manufacturers guidelines or Yemeni Guidelines. Particular note shall
be made by site inspectors of incidences where equipment requiring two man crews or
driver and observers are operated by one man.
(iii) Cesspit Removal
The basic construction guidelines will need to be expanded to address the public safety
concerns at cesspit removal sites, as follows:
During operations each site shall include specific measures to prevent casual public access to
the site. This should if necessary include the provision of temporary fences or barriers. Prior to
construction community leaders should be advised of the details of the work in their area, its
extent, duration and the hazards it poses. The threat to children should be emphasised.
During periods of non operation:
-     Wherever possible pits shall not be left open at night. They should either be backfilled,
or if that is not possible an open pit shall be covered with materials that can not be
casually removed.
Y9701                                   -6.5-                              March 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
-      lPedestrian safety problems are to be minimised by excluding the public from areas of
construction activity and ensuring that adequate and safe alternative access is provided.
-     Watchmen or security personnel shall patrol each construction site containing one or
rnore open pits.
-     Specific and appropriate warning notices will be required to advise motorists of the
hazard. Physical barriers that will prevent unauthorised vehicular access to the site
should supplement this.
-     )Pumping of cesspit waste into WWTP should be undertaken during low-flow periods.
(iv)   Public Health
As noted above, prior to the initiation of the construction of the project the population shall be
advised of the nature and extent of the works proposed.
As part of that programme the Public shall be made aware of the potential additional threats to
their health that may be generated and measures available to reduce risks. They will be advised
of what to do in the event of a person falling victim to one or other threat. Options will
include:
self-treatment options, where available
where to obtain medical attention, and when.
A number of hospitals and clinics currently exist in and around the project area as seen in
Figure 6.1. The hospitals-have emergency rooms and are attended by doctors and medical
staff 24 hours a day. The clinics are open between 8 and 12 hours a day and are staffed by
qualified medical staff.
If possible, as part of the project it would be appropriate to establish a clinic (within an
existing facility) dealing with populations from affected areas. This clinic could also be cited as
the point of contact for project affected persons for obtaining health advisory services. It need
not be necessary for the clinic to be open on a permanent basis or to have a qualified doctor
available at all open times. A health professional should however be available at all times.
(v)   Employee Health and Safety
-     Soil Contamination
Prior to construction a number of test samples should be carried out to detennine the nature
and severity of the contamination of soils in which the contractors staff will work2. The soils
should be tested for:
-     Microbiological contamination (mainly pathogens)
-     Soil acidity and chemical contamination.
2 The information gathered will also help in the prepaation of the informaton materials.
Y9701                                  -6.6-                              March 1999



Sana a Water Supply and Sanitation Services          Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
Once analysed the threat to workers should be classified into one of three categories:
-     Nil
-     Minimal Risk
-     Threat to both the workforce and the pipeline.
In the case of minimal risk simple mitigation measures such as the wearing of appropriate
clothing and education of the workforce of the risk and preventative measures proposed
would be sufficient.
If a significant threat to health is identified tests should be retaken to confirm the threat and to
establish rates of die off of pathogens. It would be expected that simple exposure will be
sufficient treatment. However this will increase the number of pits open at any one time with
significant adverse impacts elsewhere.
In the case of a defined persistent threat the area in the immnediate vicinity of the pipe should
be excavated and the waste material carted off to a dump site approved by NWSA and EPA.
Approved methods of handling and disposal will be required.
(vi)   Collection, Storage and Disposal of Household Wastewater
During construction it is anticipated that up to 9 m3 per day of wastewater will be generated
by households temporarily disconnected from their cesspits (Section 5.3.2). This waste must
be collected, stored, transported to the existing WWTP and disposed of at the inlet sump of
raw sewage inlet pump. These are clear requirements of the bid documents.
Of concern here is to ensure that operations to:
-     connect the temporary system,
-     store wastewaters,
-     empty to tanker,
-     disconnect the temporary system,
-     move system, and connect to permanent system,
are carried out in a manner that prevents (or mininiises) spillage of wastewater and in the
event of spill that there are adequate means available to contain it and neutralise it.
This will require the establishment of a unit (or as many as required by the contractor to meet
his work schedule) within the construction work force specifically trained for carrying out
these works. No other workers shall be permitted to handle or use the equipment.

(vii) Removal and Disposal of Liquid Wastes
The materials from the 2,900 pits of the Akamah Project may be extremely aggressive. It will
be anaerobic and probably very acidic and will have a strong adverse impact if disposed of
directly to existing main or interceptor sewers, or directly to the environment.
For the first four months of the construction phase, this material must be taken to the existing
WWTP and placed directly into the inlet sump (Figure 6.2). The removal and disposal of the
liquid waste must be carried out during low (off peak) flow periods into the existing WWTP
to reduce the possibility of surcharging it.
Given that the emptying of cesspit waste will only increase the load on the WWTP by 1.5% of
operating capacity (Section 5.3.3), and given that any loading will be done during low-flow
periods, it is unlikely that the disposal of cesspit waste into the WWTP will have any
significant adverse impacts. However, to ensure that the operational efficiency of the WWTP
is not further (or permanently) impaired it may be necessary for some form of dilution of the
sludge and slurry prior to disposal. The efficiency of the WWTP will be monitored by the on-
site office and the ESO as part of the monitoring programme. The ESO will determine
whether or not dilution becomes necessary.
The liquid waste will be placed in the inlet sump to be lifted by electrically driven pumps. The
standby generators must, therefore, be repaired and/or replaced to remove the risk of overflow
during periods of power outages. A sum of $55,000 has been allocated to cover the
repair/replacement of one generator.
To ensure that fly tipping is minimised, site supervisors must be responsible for registering all
vehicles that leave the cohstruction site full. A counterpart supervisor at the WWTP will
register the vehicle disposing of its load. The WWT? supervisor will also be responsible for
ensuring that all wastes are disposed of corTectly.
To ensure that existing users of wastewaters and other wastes at the WWTP are not adversely
affected, there will be a requirement for NWSA to undertake an education/ information
programme advising users of the possible changes in material and its possible impacts on
public health / crops / water quality etc.
Further, it will be necessary to monitor the output of the WWTP to ensure that there is at least
some understanding of the nature of the materials being used, (See Section 7.3.1).

(viii) Fill Material Storage and Use
The quantities of fill material required to be on site at any one time will require that effective
site management be in place. For indicative purposes it is assumed that some 45 m3 per day
will be required for use on site. Given the urban nature of the site and the relative speed with
which the construction site will proceed upstream, it is recommended that contractors be
required to bring and use material, without temporary storage, on site.
Where necessary temporary storage may be permitted provided that:
-     it is for a maximum period of 5 days.
-     all existing access is maintained.
-     no residual material is left at site.
-     heaps are located at all times in areas to be temporarily acquired for construction
purposes.
-     heaps are not located within immediate proximity to any pit or operational trench. In
such cases, "immediate proximity" would be a distance that allowed for immediate
movement of material from the heap to the pit or trench, or where children playing on
the heap would be in danger of tumbling into the excavation.
(ix)   Access Management
For Akamah, a total of some 105 truck movements a day could be required to meet the
combined cesspit emptying and fill import requirements identified in (vii) and (viii) above (a
total of 155 movements at the other sites). Assuming that at any one time 5O0/o of the required
fleet is travelling and 25% is at either origin point approximately 25 trucks will be parked or
accessing the construction site.
In all cases special management measures will need to be in place to ensure access and egress
to the site is managed without damaging surrounding properties and, where required, to
maintain public access.
In most cases, in local neighbourhoods, it would be recommended that individual roads are
closed for vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement, and property access is catered for by
defined routes clearly marked on site. Where roads are not closed measures as outlined in (ii)
above will be required to protect public safety and as in section (x) below for traffic
management.
Very specific measures will be required to ensure that all access points to a site are supervised
and that drivers and operators respect the specific regulations on speed, routes etc. defined in
an approved access plan.
The approved access plan should be defined in a plan and on the ground. The document
should outline:
-     permitted access routes, by vehicle type
-     permitted times of use of routes
-     speeds on access routes
-     site control, parking and unloading areas

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
On site signs will clearly identify approved roads. All drivers shall be required to be trained on
the contents of the plan and advised of the implications of ignoring it.
In cases where construction work is slated to take place in the immediate vicinity of special
sites, (schools, mosques and the like) or other Public Buildings, specific access issues will be
raised. Minimum access provision as outlined below will be required.
Facility        Requirement             Main Concerns
Mosque          24 hour access          Safety of access during the hours of darkness
School          Access as required      Safe and secure access for children
Public Buildings  Maintaining normal    Minimising inconvenience to potential users in
I service               the event of closure
(x)   Trafric Management
Traffic inanagement plans will be required for all secondary and primary roads outlined on
Figure 5.1. For implementation purposes two plans should be submitted, for the Ring Road
and for Other Network Roads.
The plan for these roads will be based on a programme of diversions along parallel roads with
restricted access (or no access) for local residents and in the case of wider roads (i.e., 4 lanes
or more., closure of one side of the road.
The Contractor shall prepare and submit all plans to NWSA, traffic department and the local
civil defence and other authorities for approval before construction can begin.
(xi)   Abatement of Noise and Air Pollution
* Noise
The noise from construction activities will be derived primarily from the operation of
equipment. In this regard noise levels can be mitigated as follows:
(i)  the contractor will ensure that the equipment utilised in the construction of the project is
fitted with appropriate noise muffling devices that will conform to the sound level
emissions stipulated in Table 6.3 or other appropriate standards.
Equipment not covered in these regulations should, where appropriate and reasonable,
be fitted with appropriate muffling devices.
Equipment and vehicles that are excessively noisy, (in relation to the values in Table 6.4
below) either according to the statute or otherwise defined, due to poor engine
adjustment, damage to noise amelioration equipment or other inefficient operating
conditions shall not be operated.

(ii) where smaller, noisy equipment is in operation it may be placed behind screening or
within a temporary enclosure. These will provide some noise attenuation.
(iii) the contractor will ensure that plant operated intermittently is shut down, or at a
minimum, throttled down during idle periods.
In addition, general noise abatement measures, such as those below should be utilised.
-    restricting all operations involving heavy machinery and traffic to between 6 am. and
7 p.m.
-    informing the public of the expected time and duration of works that may emit
significant noise levels.
Permission to extend periods of operation may be provided by the MPWH or the relevant
municipality authority but should as a matter of principle only be approved in two cases:
an emergency
-    in cases where it can be argued that a short period of additional working will provide
significant long term benefits to communities affected by construction activity.
Extended periods (> 3 days) of overtime worldng shall not be permitted except in exceptional
cases.
* Air Pollution excluding dust abatement
In the conduct of general construction activities and the operation of other equipment, the
contractor should be required to utilise all practical methods and devices as are reasonably

-    the methods of handling cement and pozzoloid shall include means of eliminating
atmospheric discharges of dust.
-    equipment and vehicles that show excessive emissions of exhaust gases due to poor
engine adjustment or other inefficient operating conditions should not be operated.
The contractor shall comply with applicable regulations concerning the prevention of air
pollution in force in Yemen. In the conduct of construction activities and the operation of

which has a rated production capacity not exceeding 60 ton per hour.
-    standard C is applicable to all new premises or facilities.
o Dust Abatement
During the performance of the work required the contractor should be responsible for all the
labour, equipment, materials and other means necessary required, and shall carry out proper
and efficient measures, wherever and as often as necessary, to prevent dust that has originated
from his operations from damaging dwellings, or causing a nuisance or health hazard to
persons.
Specific dust suppression measures may include:
-     establishment of, and strict compliance with, speed restrictions for all vehicles
operating within the construction site, or on access roads to the site.
-     using coverings for all vehicles transporting materials likely to give off excessive dust
emissions.
-     wetting of areas and provision of wind breakers should be used for dust abatement,
where appropriate
The contractor will be held liable for any damage resulting from dust originafting from his
operations.

For the stockpile yard, assuming no storage of hazardous materials, the only requirements are
to ensure that adequate access is provided to the main road network. In this case direct access
may be:
-     via a dedicated access road from the site to the primary road -
-     direct frontage access to the primary road
-     via a secondary public road assessed as suitable for the heavy truck movements
anticipated. Suitability in this case being a function of the land uses in the area, the
width of the road, its surface and condition, lines of sight and the junction with the
primary network.
Sites located beyond these parameters should be the subject of individual review.
The prefabrication yard will require access to adequate water supplies and immnediate access
to suitable (for heavy traffic) roads. Location criteria for the yard will be as for the stockpile
yard with the addition that it should as far as is possible be located to:
-     minimise additional dust and noise nuisance values (beyond ambient levels) on
surrounding populations,
-     limit the potential impact on surrounding populations of the water storage and use
requirements. In this context, NWSA should be required to review and approve the
water sources to be used and the proposed size of any storage facilities.
The maintenance equipment yard will be the source of the most concem. It will potentially
generate a number of wastes (solid and liquid) that should be collected, stored and disposed of
in an approved manner.
To facilitate this prior to operations the contractor shall be required to list the materials to be
used at site and define the procedures to be applied for waste control and management. If
equipment is to be leased, lessors should be informed that their facilities will be subject to
inspection and audit (see Section 7.3.1).
Where possible the contractor should be encouraged to recover, treat and re use materials, in
particular lubricants.
Accidental spill and leakage of chemicals stored on site could pose a serious potential threat to
water resources and public health. Accordingy it is proposed that the contractor be required
to submit to the NWSA an inventory of the materials to be stored on site, together with a
preliminary indication of the quantities of material that may be present at any one time.
Clearly these indications of quantity will by necessity, be indicative only. NWSA should, if
necessary, consult with specialist units in government for advice on the precautionary
measures to be taken in terms of both the planning and constuction of the camp and the
required procedures for the storage and handling of such material.
They should then inform the Contractor of these requirements. It is expected that these will
include, at a minimum, specific operational requirements such as:
Y9701                                   -6.16-                             March 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services            Sana a I Environmental Impact Assessment
-      definition of any materials to be isolated from each other
-     use of proper protective clothing, equipment by employees
-     proper handling techniques
-      other safety requirements, ventilation, firefighting equipment
However, depending on the advice of the specialist agencies, it may also include specific site
design criteria, including measures to contain and isolate spills and leakages to specific areas
through the use of hard stands, internal drainage and the construction of holding tanks4.
Location criteria for the yard should be as indicated above for the stockpile yard.
Finally in all cases contractors should be obliged to prepare a plan for the restoration of any
site utilised for the project to its former status. This will be submitted to NWSA for approval.
In most cases this will simply mean the removal of all waste and temporary facilities
established at site. Some permanent structures, hard stand area for example may need to be
broken up and taken away.
(ii)   Wastewater Treatment Plant
Items (vi) and (vii) in Section 6.3.2 require the use of the existing Wastewater Treatment Plant
(WWTP) for the disposal of collected waste materials.
Specific guidelines are laid down for the disposal of this waste. It will be necessary however
for a temporary site office to be established at the plant to allow for the supervision of the
disposal. This may be staffed by staff from the engineering supervisors or by NWSA
personnel. The supervisor will be responsible for ensuring that:
-      all waste is dumped at the location required and during the periods required.
-     registering the quantity of waste discharged (license plate and volume) to allow for
monitoring of wastes.
-      equipment at the site, such as generators and pumps, are maintained and repaired as
necessary.
-     aeration devises may be used, if feasible, to improve treatment effectiveness.
Records of the waste leaving a construction site (and those discharging at the WWTP) shall be
monitored by the supervising engineer to ensure that they match.
(iii) Access and Traffic
Mitigation of the impacts likely to accrue from construction traffic should take two forms:
Access Control
Definition of approved access routes
4 In generl terms and in all matters reated to public health and safety it is prefered that the contractor
submit a CASHES Plan for approval to NWSA.
Y9701                                     - 6.17-                             March 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services          Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
Access control will require the restriction of turning movements to approved access points to
and from existing. It may also require restrictions on the timing of use, with construction
traffic prohibited, outside of specified, supervised hours.
Prior to commencement of the contract the contractor should be required to submit to the
executing authority a plan outlining:
(i)   the location of proposed camp, entry and access points, and or points of access to the
primary road network
(ii)   additional traffic control measures required, e.g., temporary traffic lights
(iii) signage proposals
(iv)   duration of use of proposed access points
Approved access routes should also be defined in a plan and on the ground. The document
should outline:
-     permitted access routes, by vehicle type
-     permitted times of use of routes
-     speeds on access routes
-     site control, parking and unloading areas
On site signs will clearly identify approved roads. All drivers shall be required to be trained on
the contents of the plan and advised of the implications of ignoring it.
If wide or abnormal loads are required to be transported to the construction site they should,
wherever possible, be transported during the early hours of the morning. Appropriate times of
transport (but not unloading etc.) would be between 2300 and 0500 hours.
6.3.4     Construction: Resource Use
Two forms of resource use are anticipated:
(i)    Water Use; On and Off site
Significant quantities of water will be utilised on site in construction. In this context, local
communities may be affected in two ways:
-     the quantity of water available from  their water sources has been reduced by
construction activities.
-     their water sources are contaminated.
Contractors should be required to bring all water on site in tankers and be allowed to fill their
tankers only at sites defined in agreement with NWSA. These may be new facilities located at
construction yards, in communities, or pre existing facilities.
This recommendation is recognised as potentially restrictive. However, such are the costs of
non-NWSA water sources and such is the potential for community concern (and resistance)
that it is considered prudent to eliminate any potential for concern.
Y9701                                    - 6.18-                             March 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services              Sana 'a I Environmental ImpactAssessment
Off site, NWSA should again be required to approve the water source proposed for use by the
Contractor in the context of existing, local patterns of use, availability of altemative supplies
(for communities or existing users) and the likely peak quantity of water required as measured
against existing consumption pattems.
In general terms the development of new sources (wells) should not be approved unless no
reasonable alternative is available or unless the well is capped and taken out of production by
project end.
(ii)    Borrow material
Borrow material will be required to be transported to site in substantial quantities. Assuming
as a minimum, that 100% of the volume of waste liquids from the cesspits that are to be
removed must be replaced, a total of some 90,000 m3 will be required to be imported to
Akamah alone. Including all projects some 230,000 m3 will need to be imported.
Four options for accessing material are reviewed below in descending order of preference
from an environmental perspective.
Option  Description                       Issues
(i)    Use of existing facilities for all sites    May be unnecessarily restrictive to contractors and costly.
(ii)    All contractors use defined site  Difficulties in setting fees.
Issues of liability if material fails standard tests.
Site management and controL
Liability for clean up and making good.
(iii)   NWSA (or others) identity site (or sites) As (ii) above
(iv)   Contractor is allowed free hand   Must be approved
The principal criteria in the above is the desire to limit the number of new borrow pits
developed on a one off project basis. Nevertheless it is recognised that aDlowing contractors a
free hand in obtaining borrow material wil result in the least cost option and least likelihood of
construction delays and claims.
Accordingly, it is assumed that at least some new sites will be opened. Sites for development
shall be approved by NWSA in consultation with other appropriate bodies as required. Issues
to be assessed will be:
-      greatly elevated noise levels
-      dust emissions in processing and from stockpiles
-      water consumption
-      wastewater disposal
-      introduction of additional heavy traffic on roads accessing the site,
-      security, etc.
Site Development and Access Plans shall be submitted along with the request for approval.

Provided the site developed is relatively remote from residential areas and can be easily
secured these impacts are all readily manageable. On completion of operations the contractor
will be required to make good the site.
Where pre-existing sites are used site owners and operators should be inforned that they will
be subject to inspection and audit in line with project requirements.
6.3.5     Operations
Four issues of concern are addressed below.
(i)    Use of Existing Sewer Lines
The project calls for existing sewer lines and mains to be utilised to transport the collected
sewage to the WWTP. While these lines are known to be of an appropriate size their condition
is not known.
As a precursor to project implementation it is proposed that all existing main and interceptor
sewer lines to be used by the projects are subject to CCTV investigation. Clearly, given the
concept nature of many of the designs, the extent of the works to be carried out is unknown.
The recomnendations therefore take two forms:
(a)   For Akamah: Preparation of contract documentation for CCTV analysis to be
undertaken for all existing mains and interceptors to be utilised by the Project. CCTV
works to include as a minimum:
1,500 metres of interceptor
2,000 metres of main
The extent of any works required will be deternined following CCTV investigations; therefore
a Provisional sum should be allocated for any works defined as essential.
(b)-  Other Projects: Preparation of contract documentation for CCTV analysis to be
undertaken for existing mains and interceptors as follows:
Intercetor r(n. m)            Mains lin. m)
Sawad Hanash                           Nld                          Ni
Safiyah East                          1,500                        Nil
Saba'een                              1,000                        Nil
However, as a result of the findings of the Akamah programme, it may be that either:
-     there is a need for a much-reduced scope of CCTV works. The findings suggest that
only the interceptors are of concern, for example, or
-     alternatively, the damage is sufficiently widespread to suggest that pipe replacement is
a preferred option.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services        Sana 'a I Environmental ImpactAssessment
(ii)  Use of Existing Treatment Plant for Disposal of Domestic Wastes
The adverse impacts of disposal to the existing WWTP are potentially significant. However,
the only complete mitigation available is to delay construction until the new WWTP is
operational. Partial mitigation (reductions in additional cesspit loading) may be achieved by
delaying construction start until there is a reasonable certainty that the WWTP will be
completed in advance of the Akamah works5.
Alternatively it may argued that public health concerns are sufficiently great in the Akamah
area that delays in project implementation could lead to significant additional health costs,
(potentially including unnecessary deaths).
In effect the argument comes down to a single issue. Is more damage caused by disposal of the
wastewaters into the existing WWTP than by a further 4 months unsanitary conditions in the
Akamah Urban Area?
It may be possible to generate a quantitative answer to this question but any such value is
unlikely to have any more validity under intensive scrutiny of the assumptions made than
qualitative measures. It is the subjective view of this report that any incremental damage done
to the environment at and downstream of the WWTP will be relatively slight in comparison to
the quantum of that already done and most importantly is unlikely to be irreversible. Though it
will take time, once the new plant is operational the environment could in theory recover.
The issue is therefore whether the public health threat is greater in Akamah in the without
project case or downstrearn of the existing WWTP in the with project case. It is the opinion of
this report that, due in large part to the minimal impact on the existing WWTP, the public
health threat is greater in Akamah, and that the installation of sewers in Akamah should
proceed as quickly as possible.
(iii)   Re-Use Of Wastewaters and Sludge
The issue here is not the health threat posed by the re-use of wastewaters but the issue of the
strategy on re-use of the collected waters. A significant proportion of the benefits claimed for
sewage projects is that with collection and treatment they facilitate re-use. The benefits
claimed increase proportionately with water scarcity and cost.
Given problems of water scarcity in Sana'a it is therefore considered not unreasonable for any
major investment project in sewage collection to be linked to a plan that details precisely how
the collected (and treated) wastewater is to be utilised. Given this, a formal wastewater and
sludge re-use policy will be developed with assistance from IDA as part of the Sana'a I
Project. This will comprise as a minimum,
* An assessment of the options available for the use of treated waters and dried sludge. These
should include as a minimum,
-     direct re-use within the frainework of a specific of an agricultural project
-     direct re-use of dried sludge as fertiliser by farmers
-     ad hoc direct use by individual uses.
5 And also the Hasabah Water Supply Project Works if possible.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services           Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
* The creation of an effective framework for the safe use of treated materials.
Specifically there is a requirement for:
-     guidelines for the handling and transport of wastewaters not carried to the WWTP by
sewer lines.
-      guidelines for the use of the these materials for non domestic purposes6
-     guidelines for the storage and disposal of such materials
-     guidelines for the production, handling, storage and sale of produce cultivated with re-
use waters and dried sludge
-     the establishment of a  monitoring  capability sufficiently effective to assure the
population that the waters are safe for re-use and that no potable or domestic waters
have been directly contaminated by re-use products
-     the definition of areas in which treated materials may be utilised subject to the
guidelines developed.
It is understood that the MoAWR, FAO and a Dutch technical assistance team have been
evaluating the opportunities and guidelines for wastewater re-use and have submitted their
findings to the EPC for approval. Discussions with the team that undertook this work indicate
that earlier discussions centred on much less stringent guidelines and that the shift towards
greater control was in large part prompted by the situation in Taiz, where it is reported that
recent extreme water shortages have led to increased use of wastewaters and a sharp rise in
the incidence of gastro-enteritic problems.
6.4    HASABAR WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
6.4.1      Pre-Construction
There is no requirement for mitigation works during the Pre-construction Phase.
6.4.2      Construction
There is only one specific area of construction activity for which additional mitigation
measures7 may be required: Flushing and Disinfection.
Flushing and Disinfection
The contract documents call for the use of Chlorine gas or a solution of Sodium (or Calcium)
hypochlorite in the flushing and cleansing of the newly constructed pipelines.
All three chemicals! are potentially very hazardous and will need to be stored, transported,
handled and disposed of with care.
6 This strategy recognises that cultural factors dictate there will be no circumstances within the time fame
under study whereby treated waters may be utilised for domestic purposes.
7 Additional to those defined for the Sanitation Project Components and in the Construction Guidelines
' It is not believed any contractor will opt for the most hazardous of the three chemicals, Chlorine. This is
expensive and is not readily available in Yemen.

Sana a Water Supply and Sanitation Services          Sana 'a I Environmental Impact .4ssessment
It is recommended therefore that a specific unit be established with responsibility for flushing
and cleansing operations:
In addition the following basic approach should be adopted.
-     Materials storage environment to be in strict accordance with manufacturers
specifications.
-     Specific hazardous materials handling and storage procedures to be established (or
reviewed) and an appropriate training programme for staff developed.
-     Access to materials strictly controlled and register kept of use and access.
-     To avoid the risk of casual public contact with the raw chemicals (either through
spillage, vandalism or negligence), materials should be mixed off site, in a controlled
environment, and transported to site in appropriate vehicles.
-     Two man tanker crew trained in the event of an accident
-     HAZOPS procedures should be designed (or reviewed) and staff trained in their use.
Regular testing of contingency planning and procedures is required.
-     All other personnel off site during flushing and disinfection operations.
Under all possible concentrations (initial concentration 5 ppm minimum residual chlorine after
first flushing, maximum residual chlorine 1 ppm after final flush) the disinfection solution
wastewater would be of sufficient concentration to cause long term damage to the WWTP
(kill off of bacteria) if discharged directly to it. Distances to the plant however, are
considerable (7 kin) and it would expected that substantial dilution will occur during the
transmission period.
It is therefore considered reasonable for such materials to be discharged directly to sewers. To
minimise potential damage to the sewers the rate of discharge should not exceed the maximum
design velocity of the sewerage system, 3m/s.
An audit of the chemical storage facility and the equipment to be utilised in injection should be
undertaken prior to first use and at random thereafter and the recommnendations of any audit
implemented prior to any further operational use of the facility if so specified.
As indicated earlier in Section 6.3.4 to minimise potential (albeit negligible) adverse impacts
on the availability of water to local communities, contractors should be required to bring all
water on site in tankers and be allowed to fill their tankers only at sites defined in agreement
with NWSA.
6.4.3     Oierations
Existing System
To ensure that supplies are maintained at a minimum at present levels the contractor should be
required to ensure that no pipe is removed or disconnected until an alternative temporary
replacement is in place.

To ensure that all existing consumers receive supplies from the new network, NWSA should
be required to undertake a programme of surveys and consultation to identify all consumers
who are to receive connections.
Once the new network is operational, NWSA should be required to remove all surface
elements of the previous networks in order to ensure that they can not simply be&re-used to
establish another new illegal connection or system that may pose a threat to the health of any
user, and which may reduce the level of service to other paying consumers.
Such action would also send a signal to potential illegal connectors of NWSA's intent to
prevent the proliferation of illegal connections, especially if there are subsequent sweeps by the
O and M division aimed at eliminating illegal connections.

7.2.1     Establishment of Environment and Safety Officer (ESO)
NWSA does not have an established schedule of responsibilities and training on matters
relating to the environment, nor does it have line responsibility to which all levels of staff owe
accountability. This has just started at the EPC with technical assistance from the Dutch
Govermnent. For this project, therefore, an Environmental Safety Officer (ESO), with a
thorough knowledge of site conditions and safety practices, should be appointed to the project
management unit (PMU). The ESO costs are shown in Table 7.4, his responsibilities are
outlined in Table 7.2 and indicative TOR for this position are included as Annex 7.1 to this
section. During this project (until the project completion report is finalised) he will be directly
responsible for ensuring the implementation of the environmental management plan. He will
also be responsible for liaising with all parties involved in the project, especially the
engineering team and environmental consultants, and advise as necessary on all environmental
matters concerning the project and in relation to the EMP.

The project ESO will report directly to the PMU Director. The ESO will be responsible for
monitoring all compliance with EMP directives. Following is a breakdown of ESO responsi-
bilities.
7.2.2     Establishment of Baseline Conditions
Baseline conditions for the programme wlll be established during the pre-construction phase
with relevant measurements taken to establish, as far as is possible, the ambient conditions.
The programme of works should ensure that the baseline conditions defined represent actual
conditions for 1998/99. Each parameter will be measured at least once a month for a three-
month period prior to work starts in each area.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services      Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
W*hile this may appear to be an obvious requirement, it is often the case that projects are
identified, developed and implemented at a pace that allows only the most rudimentary
assessment of ambient conditions to be made. In these circumstances, it is not uncommon for
serious sampling / data collection, and interpretative errors to be made that provide a false
image of the ambient environment. To ensure that this does not occur, it is proposed that
preparatory works be initiated in April 1999.
All testing will be contracted out to Sana'a University, and monitored by the ESO. Costs
associated with establishing baseline conditions are found in Table 7.5. Costs will be incurred
in YR. A more detailed breakdown of these costs can be found in Annex 7.2 to this section.
The associated ongoing monitoring programme is described in Section 7.3.1.

7.2.3     Public Meetines
As outlined in Section 6.2, a public consultation programme has already been undertaken,
including a series of public meetings. Prior to the start of construction, the ESO will organise
additional public meetings in the Akamah and Hasabah areas to inform the public of what they
might expect from upcoming construction activities.
7.2.4     Establishment of Office at Existing WWTP & Diesel Generator
Repair/Renlacement
As outlined in section 6.3.3, it will be necessary to establish an office at the existing WWTP, in
order to monitor waste materials from construction activities that will be discharged into the
treatment plant. This office will be established prior to construction activities in order that it be
fully operational when cesspit sewage starts being loaded into the treatment plant.
In addition, $55,000 will be made available for the repair/replacement of the standby diesel
generator at the existing WWTP.

7.3.1    Monitoring Programme
Physical benefits of the programme should be determined through a groundwater quality-
monitoring programme. It is claimed that project benefits may be derived from reduced
contamination of groundwater in the study area.
A monitoring programme of the ground water is being undertaken by the NWSA PMU for the
Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project and the Faculty of Engineering at the Sana'a
University. This programme needs to be expanded and modified to meet the requirements of
this monitoring programme. Initially it is proposed to identify three wells for monitoring
purposes within the (Phase 1) study area. These should be the subject of a monthly monitoring
programme starting at least 3 months4 before construction activities occur in the immediate
area of influence. This will allow pre project baseline conditions to be established. Ultimately a
network of eight wells should be established covering all the project areas as follows.
-     Akamah                    2 wells (Phase 1)
-     Sawad Hanash              I well
-     Safiyah Gharbia           1 well
-     Saba'een                  I well
-.    Safiyah Sharkia           2 wells
Hasabah                   I well (Phase 1)
These wells should be monitored for microbiological and chemical quality, and depth to water
as indicated in Table 7.7. The limited number of parameters selected is a function of the cost
of laboratory analyses.
It will be noted in Table 7.7 that five wells are defined for monitoring, with the additional two
located downstreamn of the WWTP. Clearly, the vast majority of impacts associated with these
sites will be derived from the operation of the new treatment plant. However, it is argued here
4 The programme is tied to constuction works as the new system will become opertiaal; sectiot by section
on an as and when completed basis. Given the very tight project implementation Programme outlined in
Section 3, the location of the wells may be influenced by the constrction work programme.

that ultimately a comprehensive network of groundwater monitoring sites will be required, and
that such programmes should be established as soon as is possible. Therefore, if no proposals
exist for a monitoring project (associated with the WWTP Project) they should be established
within the Framework of Sana'a 1 and the wider framework of the Sector DP.

Similar arguments apply to the wastewater effluent, however the new treatment plant will have
a well-equipped and fully staffed lab and flow measurement devices. This lab will monitor the
quantity and quality of effluent from the WWTP. The ESO will work with WWTP personnel
to ensure that their analysis is available as part of the monitoring progranmme. In this context,
there is still a justifiable need within the project framework to:
- ensure that the shock loading received at the WWTP from the concentrated sludge and
slurry extracted from the cesspits5 do not have an adverse impact on the new WWTP
treatment performance (as reflected in effluent quality).
- ensure that all such wastes are processed by the WWTP and not simply discharged,
untreated.
- ensure that the wastes discharged and re-utilised meet the standards required.
a)    Site Access
For the Construction Monitoring Programme to be effective it will be necessary, during the
course of construction and operation, for authorised agents from key agencies, (NWRA,
NWSA and EPC) to occasionally conduct inspections for the purpose of determining
S This will apply mainly to project elements constrced after Akamab.

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services       Sana a I Environmental Impact Assessment
compliance with the EMP and all applicable regulations and statutes. Access to all sites related
to the project must therefore be guaranteed.
Accordingly, the contract documents and operating agreements shall incorporate a phrase with
similar intent to that outlined below.
Any officer authorised in writing by EPC, NfWA or NWSA may at any time enter any
premises whether prescribed or otherwise, and may:
-  Examine and inspect equipment, control equipment, monitoring equipment or plant;
-  Take samples of any pollutants that are emitted, discharged or deposited or are likely to
be or are of a class or kind that are usually emitted, discharged or deposited from such
premises;
-  Examine any books, records or documents relating to the performance or use of such
equipment, control equipment, monitoring equipment or plant or relating to the emission,
discharge or deposit from such premises;
-  Photograph such premises as he considers necessary or make copies of any book, records
or documents seen in the course of such examination.
b)    Site Inspections
Objectives
Regular and frequent site inspections will be required to permit the ESO to monitor the
performance of the contractor, and at a later date system operators, with regard to compliance
with the stipulations contained in this EMP and the EIA.
Site inspections should be carried out on a regular basis but not necessarily to a structured
pattern. However during construction, as a minimum, the programme outlined in Table 7.8
should be observed.
To facilitate inspections, a checklist of items to be considered similar to that provided in
Appendix F shall be drawn up. The checklist should be distributed to all parties concerned
with construction, who should also receive a briefing by ESO prior to initiation of construction
works.

c)    Environmental Quality Monitoring
* Objectives
In addition to the site inspections it will also be necessary to monitor the physical environment
of the construction sites. This will require quantitative assessments derived from monitoring
sites:
-  to monitor alterations in existing physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the
environment.
-  to determine whether any detected changes in environmental components are caused by
the project or natural occurrences.
-  to determine the impacts of non compliance with ELA and EMP requirements by the
contractor, in particular to monitor emissions and discharges and ensure compliance with
local, national and international standards.
-  to deternine the effectiveness of the ameliorating measures.
-  to highlight areas of concern unforeseen in the EIA and EMP and provide a basis for
recommending further amelioration measures.
* Sampling Programme
(i)    Complaint based and Random Sampling
Random sampling, of both fixed sites and construction sites will be undertaken together with
measurements prompted by complaints by local residents. In general terms it is expected that
such works will be confined to dust and noise nuisance but capacity may be required for other
assessments. Clearly the nature and extent of this programme can not be determined but an
indicative random programme is drawn up below to which a 20% contingency is to be applied
for complaint based works. A summary of the proposed random sampling programme for the
Construction period is outlined in Table 7.9.
Table 7.9: Summarm of Proposed Sampling Programme Frequency: Construction
Parameter       Unit        Frequency        Duration      No. of Sites
. Dust       TSP        2 day / quarter   24 hour period     2
Noise    |    LeL        2 day / quarter   0600-2200          5
(ii)   Fixed Site Sampling
No fixed sampling programme is proposed. The project does not involve large-scale
earthworks or the opening up of new rights of way. Moreover, except for that originating
from off site facilities such as Pre-Fabrication yards and Borrow Pits, it is likely that the
disamenity suffered by populations in any one area will be for only a very limited period. At off
site facilities, random sampling, inspections (and complaints) will indicate whether further
actions need be taken.
All testing will be contracted out to Sana'a University, and monitored by the ESO. Costs
associated with the construction and operations monitoring programme are found in Table
7.10. Costs will be incurred in YR. A more detailed breakdown of these costs can be found in
Y9701                                 -7.9-                            March 1999

7.3.2     Environmental Audits
(i)    Objectives
The environmental audit process provides an assessment of the project, environmental
management activities and the effectiveness of the system in fulfilling GOY environmental
policy. In implementing the audit schemes, project areas perceived as having the highest
environmental risk are stressed. The audit programme has the responsibility to:
- examine compliance with regulatory requirements
-  examine line management systems, plant operations, monitoring practices etc.
- identify current and potential environmental problems especially during the operational
phase of the project
- check the predictions in the EIA and assure the implementations and application of
- recommended practices and procedures.
- make recommendations for the improvement of the management system of the operation.
(ii)   Frequency
At least one audit should be carried out for every major facility in operation during each
construction phase' or at a minimum of one per year, preferably during IDA supervision
missions. Qualifying facilities would include the main construction camp and any off site
processing and storage facilities.
(iii)  Implementation
All audits will be performed by the ESO, with assistance from World Bank project supervision
personnel (TOR for the environmental aspects of IDA supervision rnissions are in Appendix
G). All audits should be straightforward exercises that should take no more than one day to
6 Phase 1= Akamah and Hasabah. Phase 2 iicludes all other project components.

complete. Accordingly, an additional $1,000 will be allocated for printing and dissemination
purposes only.
7.3.3     Public Consultation
The public consultation and awareness program comprises three components: (i) public
meetings; (ii) newspaper and television articles and programs; and (iii) household surveys.
Meetings organised by the ESO will be held semi-annually before and during the construction
period, coinciding with IDA supervision missions whenever possible. Feedback elicited during
these meetings will be used by the ESO in the semi-annual Environmental Reports. In this
way, any necessary changes to the mitigation plan will be incorporated.
7.3.4     Additional Proiect Requirements
a)    NGO Involvement
It is also important that, wherever possible, the project helps develop the capacity of NGOs.
At this stage, as with all projects, it is difficult to define NGOs that could be directly supported
in the programme. It will be the responsibility of the PMU and the ESO to identify and
encourage NGO involvement.
b)    Health Clinic
As stated in 6.3.2, as part of the project it may be necessary to establish a health clinic (within
an existing facility) dealing with populations from affected areas. Clinics should be established
in cases where project construction is taking place in areas that are not readily served by local
health facilities. Determination of this need will be the responsibility of the contractor, with
guidance from the ESO. Implementation will be done by the ESO and the PMU. Potential
costs for the clinic are US$24,800; details for which can be found in Table 7.17 of Annex 7.2.
c)    Potential Additional Costs to the Contmctor
Table 7.19 in Annex 7.2 represents costs that will be directly incurred by the contractor during
project irnplementation, in order to conform to the Environmental Management Plan. Some of
these costs (such as those for water storage) may not be necessary, but project funds will be
made available for these purposes, if and when they occur.
Until the plant is decommissioned, an office at the existing WWTP wilt be maintained, in order
to ensure that wastes from project activities are discharged directly into the inlet sump of the
treatment plant, and to make sure that fly tipping doesn't occur. All trucks entering the facility
will be recorded, and logs will be checked against those taken at the construction site. The
office will ensure that all wastes will be tansferred during off-peak lfours.

7.4.1     Monitoring
The operation of the Sana'a 1 project is entirely by gravity in pipes. There are no electro-
mechanical facilities, maintenance yards or any other site developed specifically for the project.
There will therefore be no requirement for site inspections during this phase.
Post construction monitoring for the project will be maintained with the following objectives
in mind:
(i)    to  monitor alterations in existing physical, chemical, biological and social
characteristics of the environment.
(ii)   to determine whether any detected changes in environmental components are caused
by the project or natural occurrences.
(iii)   to monitor emissions and discharges at the new wastewater treatment plant and
ensure compliance with local, national and international standards.
(iv)   to determine the effectiveness of the ameliorating measures.
(v)    to provide early warning of any potentially serious problems
(vi)   to measure long term impacts
There are no potentially significant negative residual impacts identified in the EIA that may
need to be monitored. There are however a number of potential benefits claimed for the
project that may be quantifiable. The ESO will be responsible for post-construction monitoring
until IDA's project closes in September 2002. After that, NWSA will be responsible for
carrying on the monitoring program.
7.4.2     Public Consultatioh
a)    Public Meetings
As a follow-up to civil works, and as a component of the End of Project Report, the ESO will
organise a public meeting. Emphasis will be put on lessons learnt during construction.
b)    Surveys
* Methodology
Fieldwork was conducted in Sana'a in March of 1998, principally in the neighbourhoods of
Akamah and Sawad Hanash and a total of 520 households were surveyed over a 5-day period.
Z9701                                 - 712-                           March 1999



Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services         Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
Water vendors, realtors, shopowners, and local clinics were also interviewed. A total of 15
private taps were selected and sampled, and the existing treatment plant and the fields
currently irrigated with raw sewage were inspected.
* Follow-up Surveys
The Project plans follow-up surveys in both the Akamah and Hasabah areas halfway through
the Project's implementation period, which is estimated to be one year after the sewage
network has been completed. Among hypotheses to be tested, the surveys would examine the
following:
- Households take a number of defensive actions to compensate for the lack of reliability of
the water system.
- Households perceive the water coming from the water system to not be potable.
- Households take a number of preventive actions to mitigate water quality problems (e.g.
boiling water, purchasing bottled water)
- Households perceive that the major issue with water quality is contamination of faecal
nature.
-  Households would be willing to use recycled wastewater (that would meet potable
standards) for a variety of purposes, including drinking, washing, toilet flushing, and
garden irrigation.
- Significant expenditures are incurred to treat waterborne diseases.
- Households incur significant expenses to operate and maintain existing on-site sanitation
systems.
-  Households buy 50% of their water from non-NWSA sources.
- With the installation of the sewer network, property values increased by 20%.
The survey's implementation will be the responsibility of the ESO. Table 7.18, in Annex 7.2
summarises the associated costs.

As with all reports from contractors received by the ESOJPMU, the originals will be filed and
held, available for reference by any concerned party.
Semi-Annual Environmental Reports
The ESO will be responsible for the preparation of semi-annual Environmental Reports. These
reports should be produced throughout the construction period. They will be prepared
following the World Bank semi-annual supervision missions, and based in part on the findings
of the environmental audit and consultation processes. It is envisaged that each report will
have two main sections:
I)    Review of Project Performance
This will outline the performance of all agencies involved in the Project; improvement or
deterioration, as measured against previous baselines and established targets where
appropriate; and establish new performance targets.
In the latter context, it is recommended that appropriate, specific targets be employed in the
assessment process to ensure that the findings permit direct comparison with previous
performance and in the context of defined objectives. If a specific evaluation technique or
framework is not adopted, annual targets for achievement will need to be defined for the
upcoming year in the annual report.
The assessment should draw on the findings of the inspection reports, monitoring programmes
and environmental audits.
II)   Review of Project Works
This would comprise a review of all actions undertaken within the Project in the previous
period. It would include as a minimum:
-     Progress reports on project and programme implementation
-     Comparison to Baseline Indicators
-     Summary report on training programmes I workshops held etc.
-     Activity report on the awareness campaign
-     Activity report of site inspections programme
-     Activity report from the monitoring and audit programme
In general terms each report should contain:
- background to the project /programme I works
- summary statements of methodologies adopted

monitoring review report. This shall contain:
- background to the project
- the empirical findings of the monitoring programme and the site inspections
- a statement on the methodologies adopted for monitoring, the suitability of equipment
utilised, its performance, the practical and technical difficulties experienced in collecting
and analysing the data. Recommendations for future works
- a statement on suitability of resources available for monitoring and inspection and
reconmmendations for future works
- a statement on the efficiency, or otherwise, of mitigation measures proposed
- a statement on the significance of any changes identified, both physical and social, as
compared to those predicted

APPENDIX C
- Existing WWTP and Mitigation Plan



San'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services        Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Asesiment
APPENDIX C: EXISTING WWTP AND MITIGATION PLAN
History
The WWTP was designed to handle the future sewage flow collected by the sewerage
network and its extensions. The WWTP was located to the west of Sana'a Airport, but due to
difficulties pertaining to the site and since Stage I Sewerage Network was built, and a
temporary wastewater treatment facility (TWWTF) was constructed at Al-Rawdhah in 1988.
This TWVWTF has been referred to as the existing WWTP.
The TWWTF was designed as oxidation ponds with a design capacity of 6,000 m3/day and
sewage strength of 460 mg BOD/I. No flow measurement devices were installed and no flow
measurements were undertaken.
Since its construction, there has been no major improvement made to the TWW'T except
deepening the anaerobic bonds to accommodate more sludge.
Operational Practices
The use of such treatment facilities is restricted to small communities and/or flow and should
be located at least one Idlometre upstream of urban areas in the prevailing wind direction.
The city, since 1998, has expanded in the vicinity of the TWWTF. At the same time, more
sewage collection networks were built.
The new networks increased the flow entering the TWWTF without any modification to it.
This has reduced the retention time with an accompanying deterioration in the quality of the
effluent.
Storm water drainage facilities are limited in Sana'a, and where they exist do not often
function properly. It is common practice in Sana'a that citizens open the sewerage manhole
covers to let the storm water evacuate through the sanitary sewer system. The flow in such
cases is very high, and far beyond the capacity of the TWWTF. The operators close the inlet
to the facility and divert the whole flow to the conveyor downstreamn of the TWWTF.
The purpose of the diversion is multi-fold: to divert the large flow from the facility, to prevent
the ingress of mud, sand and debris into the facility and most importantly, not to over dilute
the liqueur in the pond and offset the microbiological balance.
Capacity
Flow
There are no flow measurements either at the inlet or outlet of the TWWTF. Therefore, there
are no records available on the flow patterm.
The flow was estimated in 1991 at 8,000 m3/day by Harvey F. Ludwig (Report on Appro-
priate Sewage Treatment for Sana'a, Seatec International Co., Ltd., October 1991).
Y9701                                 -C.-                             March 1999



Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services        Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Asressment
Howard Humphreys & Partners Ltd. measured the flow continuously for 10 days, at the inlet
weir to the pumping station in March 1994, and found the average flow to be 10,197 m3/day
(Design Report and Review of Impact, January 1995).
The Consultants estimate the flow to be 15,600 m3/day, based on the current (1998)
population served and per capita water consumption.
Sewage Strength
The laboratory of NWSA Sana'a Branch has taken and analysed samples of incoming sewage
at the TWWTF at various times since its commission but at irregular times and infrequently.
The average of these samples is about 490 mg BOD/1.
Harvey F. Ludwig measured the BOD of the influent in 1991 to be 500 mg/I.
Howard Humphreys & Partners Ltd. measured the sewage strength on samples collected three
times per day on four weekly occasions in March and July 1994. The average BOD of 20
samples collected under this programme was 485.5 mg/I.
The Consultants measured the sewage strength on a composite sample taken at the TWWTF
inlet in September 1997 and September 1998 and found it to be 385 mg/l and 480 mg/I
respectively.
Effluent
The BOD of the effluent as measured by the laboratory of NWSA Sana'a Branch on samples
collected by them since the TWWTF was commissioned ranged from 48.5 to 361 mg/ with an
average of 133 mg/I.
Harvey F. Ludwig measured the BOD of the effluent in 1991 and it was about 80 mg/I.
The Consultants measured the BOD of the effluent of the TWWTF inlet in September 1998
and found it to be 150 mg/I.
It is worth noting that although there was no major change in the strength of the raw sewage,
there has been appreciable change, since 1993, in the quality of the effluent as indicated in the
following table:
Influent mg BODA               Effluent mg BODA

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services     Sana 'a I Environmental Impact Assessment
Estimated Flow
The flow into the TWWTF has gradually increased since its commission, through an increase
in the number of inhabitants served and/or an increase in the per capita water consumption.
There are no records available that can assist in estimating the current flow into the TWWTF.
Flow in 1991
Harvey F. Ludwig estimated the number of equivalent connections at 13,200 with an average
of 7 persons per connection or 98,000 total served population. This gave rise to a total flow
of 8,000 m3/day or an 86 l/c/d net sewage flow.
The results of the surveys that the Consultants conducted under the Project indicate that the
average number of persons connected per one water supply house connection is 14.6. These
results also indicate that the average per capita water consumption is 65 I/d, which gives rise
to an average net sewage flow of 52 I/c/d. Based on available data, the best estimate of the
total population in 1991 is 825,000. The Consultants estimate that the population served by
the sewerage network in 1991 was 175,000, or about 12,000 connections. This population
would generate sewage flow of 9,100 m3/day.
Flow in 1994
Two basic data were measured and fixed in 1994. They were: population as per 1994 Census,
and sewage flow as per the measurement of Howard Humphreys & Partners Ltd.
Under the probable assumption that there was no increase in the population connected since
1991, a per capita net sewage flow of 58 I/d would result.
The census estinates that the portion of the population served by a sewerage system at 25
percent. The total population served in this case was estimated at about 238,600, which
results in a per capita net sewage flow of 43 Vd and 16,343 connections. The number of
connections in this case is probably exaggerated.
Flow in 1998
The Consultants estimated the population of Sana'a in 1998 at 1,196,652 people, based on the
1994 Census and population growth rate. They also estimated the population served, based
on the collected data on the expansion of the sewerage network, to be 297,600 people or
20,384 connections (14.6 persons per connection).
NWSA estimates the number of connections at 18,500, which will result in a population
served of 270,100 (14.6 persons per connection).
The generated flow is estimated to range between 11,614 m3/day (low consumption and low
population) to 15,475 m3/day (highr consumption and high population).

The population served and the estimated flows in 1991, 1994 and 1998 are summarised in the

Summary
In summary, the actual capacity of the TWWTF, the actual flow entering the facility, and the
effectiveness of the treatment are all unknown. It is clear from the little data and information
available, that the flow entering the TWWTF far exceeds it capacity, the retention time is short
and the treatment is not very effective. BOD removal has dropped from about 82 percent in
early years of facility operation to about 68 percent in recent years.
The best estimate for the average flow is about 15,500 m3/day, and an average BOD of about
480 mg/I. The BOD of the effluent is 150 mg/l on the average.
Loading from Akamah
Pit Loading
The total volume of sewage and slurry to be removed from cesspits in the Akamah area is
30,000 m3 to be removed within 14 months of actual construction operations.  This is
equivalent to about 2,145 m3 per month or about 85 m3 per day assuming 25 working days per
month. At worst about 90 m3 would be removed daily. This constitutes about 0.6 percent of
the average daily flow into the TWWTF and 1.5 percent of the design capacity. The volume
'to be collected from the cesspits in Akamah is very small compared to the flow entering the
TWWTF and its strength does not differ from that of the flow. The effect of this added
sewage is very negligible and any shock loading is therefore not anticipated.
Temporary Collection
The total potential number of cesspits to be cleared from the Akamah area is 2,900, at an
average rate of 8.28 pits per worldng day. The population of Akamah is 41,000 persons
connected to about 3,500 pits, or 11.7 persons per pit on average. The 'sewage should be
collected in temporary facilities from houses that are to be disconnected from their cesspits
and are awaiting connection to the sewage collection network. The. waste of about 50 persons
should be collected in such cases. At 52 1/c/d net wastewater return, the volume to be

Sana 'a Water Supply and Sanitation Services      Sana a I Environmental Imoact As. e.tunent
collected and removed is 2.6 m3/day. This constitutes about 0.017 percent of the average
daily flow into the TWWT.
Permanent Connection
The total population of Akamah will be connected within 14 months construction period. This
means that wastewater from about 2,930 persons per month will be collected and disposed of
through the permanent sewage collection network. The average daily flow added to the
systems would be about 150 m3/day every month. The actual construction operations are
expected to commence in August 1999. Therefore the average daily additional sewage flow at
the end of each month is expected as follows:
Month           Flow, m3/day      Month           Flow, m3/day
August 1999         150           March 2000         1,200
September 1999      300           April 2000         1,350
October 1999        450           May 2000           1,500
November 1999       600           June 2000          1,650
December 1999       750           July 2000          1,800
January 2000        900           August 2000        1,950
February 2000      1,050          September 2000     2,100
Under this condition, about 1 percent of the average daily flow into the TWWTF is perma-
nently added to the sewage collection system.
The new WWIP is scheduled to be commissioned in December 1999. By that time, about five
percent of the average daily flow into the TWWTF should have been permanently comected.
Options for Mitigation
Based on the above presentation, the options for mitigation are the following:
* collect the flow generated from the project area and from temporary collection, and the
cesspit contents, and discard to a tenporary site.
* overload the TWWTF further by the sewage collected from the project area and through
temporary collection.
* discharge the cesspit contents and from the temporary collection into the existing sewer
system.
* discharge the cesspit contents and from the temporary collection at the TWWTF during
off-peak hours.
* upgrade the TWWTF to cater for the additional loading.
* defer the project implementation.
The BOD level from samples collected from one cesspit in Akamah area is about 490 mg/I,
which is about the average BOD level of Sana'a raw sewage. The volume removed per
cesspit and dumped into the TWWTF is about 0.8 percent of the average daily flow entering
it. This is equivalent to a dilution rate of 125 times.

9.   REVIEW OF IMPACTS
This section reviews the impacts of the proposed treatment plant
relating to:
* Odour
4  Effluent re-use and disposal
* Sludge disposal
* Occupational hazards
* Power failure
* The airport
9.1   Odour
The treatment process selected, the crude sewage extended
aeration process, is inherently odour free, since incoming sewage,
which is likely to be septic, is stabilised by contact with the large
volume of aerated activated sludge present in the aeration tanks.
The proposed design additionally features returning the Retum
Activated Sludge to the inlet pumping station where it will mix
with the incoming sewage and significantly control odours at that
point.
The inlet pumping station screws will be covered to prevent the
release of any remaining odours.
The extended aeration process stabilises the surplus sludge by
aerobic means within the system and the resultant sludge is
basically odour free, although it does have a faint earthy smell
which is not unpleasant
The sludge drying beds will emit this "earthy" smell but it will not
cause objection or complaint as the nearest neighbouring
buildings are more than 500 metres from the location of the beds.
The Recca Sewage Treatment Works, Kuwait, is generally similar
to the proposed Sana'a Treatment Works, but treats highly septic
sewage without odour or complaint
There is no reason why Sana'a Sewage Treatment Plant should be
any less successful and free of odour.

9.2  Effluent Re-Use and Disposal
9.2.] Previous Studies
The subject of effluent reuse has focused much attention in the
Republic of Yemen and there are several useful previous reports
to which reference has been made namely:
- Water Supply Nvastewater and Sanitation, Final Report in 6
volumes, June 1992 by UNDP/DESD Project YEM/88/001.
- Report on Appropriate Sewage Treatnent for Sana'a, October
1991 by Harvey F Ludwig, SEATEC International Co. Ltd,
Bangkok, Thailand.
- Sana'a Sewerage and Sewage Treatment, 1976, Howard
Humphreys and Sons.
- Sana'a Sewerage System Master Plan, December 1975,
Italconsult, Rome.
9.2.2 Physical Setting
9.2.2.1 Location of Irrigation Areas
The proposed irrigation scheme area utilising treated effluent
would be most suitably located downstream of the treatment plant
site spanning either side of Waadi Saila.
9.2.2.2 Topography
The elevation of the treatment plant site is about 2181 m above
sea level. There is a smooth fall to the waadi on both east and
west sides and the waadi bed gradient is approximately 1 in 400.
The topography is generally even to slightly undulating and is
suitable for a gravity irrigation scheme from the treatment plant
outlet. There is no detailed topographical survey of the area.
9.2.2.3 Rainfall
Annual rainfall data has been obtained for Sana'a from the Civil'
Aviation and Meteorology Authority, over years 1983 to 1989.
The annual average calculates to 180 mm, the wet season being
generally between tertiary and August peaking in April. The
remaining months are dry except for light showers. The average
monthly rainfall is given in Table 9.2.1 below.
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREP.AO1                                  Page 53.



Table 9.2.1
Sana'a Average Mlonthly Rainfall (mm)
J    F    M    A    M    3    J    A    S    0    N    D    Total
4.8  7.8  26.2  61.3  18.3  9.3  15.2  28.8  4.6  0.0  0.0  3.5  179.8
In their 1975 Master Plan Italconsult estimated the mean annual
rainfall to be 300 mm between 1978 and 1974. They also
estimated the 1 in 100 year 24 hour rainfall intensity to be 97
mm.
Invariably a months rainfall can occur in one or two heavy falls
giving rise to waadi spate flow which is typical of the region. This
rainfall therefore cannot be considered as effective in the
determination of crop water requirements.
9.2.2.4 Flooding
In 1975 Italconsult undertook a study of the surface water
resources of the catchments surrounding Sana'a. They estimated
the 1 in 100 year flows entering the city from the south to be 52
m3/s.
Historic floods have been recorded in 1964, 1967, 1970, 1975 and
as recently as March 1994. Although the WVaadi Saila watercourse
through Sana'a has sufficient capacity to carry most floods,
flooding in the city was recorded in 1975 as well as 1994.
To alleviate flooding in the city Italconsult recommended that
Waadi Saila be canalised over a total distance of 8.6 km from
south of the city north to the existing treatment plant. They
estimated the cumulative total 1 in 100 year flood to be 208 m3/s
in the waadi north of the city and then recommended further
study of flood flows up to the airport and beyond.
The existing waadi capacity north of the proposed new treatnent
plant has been estimated to be 250-300 m3/s assuming an average
width of 80 metres and depth of 1.5 metre, a slope of 1 in 400
and Mannings roughness of 0.03. Farmers have already built
some bunding in the area to protect their crops against flooding.
9.2.2.5 Geology and Soils
The geology of the area comprises Quaternary Volcanics and
fluviatile deposits which overlie tertiarytrap volcanics to the south
and east and Mesozoic and Palaeocene sedimentary formations to
the north and west. The thickness of the Quaternary sediments

may be considerable.
The soils have been examined in outcrop and in trial pits. In
general the top layer ranges from 0.7 m to 3.7 m comprising a
dark brown firm to stiff clayey silt with medium sized gravel.
These soils have good infiltration rates but have sufficient clay
content to cause ponding when saturated.
Photographic evidence of existing cropping in the waadi shows
the soils to have reasonable nutrients although short of nitrogen.
It is reported that farmers use urea but there is no data on

9.2.3 Effluent Re-Use Standards
9.2.3.1 General
Re-using wastewater usually incurs some risk to human health
and the environment. These risks must be reduced to a level
acceptable to the community and weighed against the benefits of
alleviating water shortages.
The re-use of treated wastewater can only be considered where
the allocation of adequate economic and manpower resources
ensure that:
- treatment levels can be maintained;
- monitoring of water quality and health impacts continue;
- the importance of adhering to the necessary restrictions on
usage.
These requirements are essential. There is no sense in re-
exposing the population to the diseases which the very collection
and treatment of waste water is intended to prevent.
The primary consideration in the selection of treatment process
must be the efficacy of pathogen removal. Those pathogens likely
to be present in waste water must be assessed for each particular
area. It must be realised that much uncertainty still exists
regarding precise removals of various organisms and indeed
whether such organisms are good indicators of actual patiogen
content.
Reliability in performance is probably the most important factor
in any treatment process. Second to this must be operability, i.e.
the local skills, maintenance facilities and adequate funds for
running costs must be adequate to ensure efficient operation of
the wastewater supply.

The reuse of treated sewage effluent for agriculture is not a new
concept. Effluent reuse for landscape greening is common place
in many countries notably the Middle East. Several countries have
developed their own effluent treatment standards and
bacteriological limits for reuse.
9.2.3.2 Health Aspects
A WHO Scientific Group on Health Aspects of the Use of Treated
Wastewater for Agriculture and Aquaculture met in Geneva in
November 1987 and the report was published two years later
(WHO, 1989). The approach to the health effects of effluent re-
use taken by this group has been adopted as a basis for
considering the health aspects of effluent re-use in many
countries. WHO's recommended guidelines given in the report
are shown in Table 9.2.2.

9.2.3.3 Guidelines for Interpretation of Water Quality for Irrigation
It is important to understand the chemical reaction between the treated effluent
supply and the soils which are being irrigated. Wastewater contains impurities,
and therefore careful consideration must be given to the possible long term
effects on soils and plants from salinity, sodicity, nutrients and trace elements
that occur naturally or are added during domestic or industrial use. Such
effects are normally manageable if associated problems with these impurities
are understood and allowances made for them.
The guidelines presented in Table 9.2.3 have been reproduced from FAO Paper
No. 29. They are sufficient to make reliable estimates of soil and crop
responses to the use of treated effluent where the primary limitation is the
chemical constituent, such as the total dissolved salts, relative sodium content
and toxic ions.

b    EC. means electrical conductivity, a measure of the water salinity,
reported in decisiemens per centimetre (Ds/cm)-at 25 degrees
centigrade or in units millimhos per centimetre (mmho/cm).
Both are equivalent. TDS means total dissolved solids, reported
in milligrams per litre (mg/1).
SAR means sodium absorption ratio. At a given SAR, infiltration
rate increases as water salinity increases.  Conversely a low
salinity water or water with a high sodium to calcium ratio will
decrease infiltration. Evaluate the potential infiltration problem
by SAR as modified by ECU. The relationship between SAR of the
irrigation water and ESP (Exchangeable Sodium Percentage) of the
soils of equilibrium to be achieved is given in Table 2 and Figure
1 of FAO Paper No. 29, 1985.
d     For surface irrigation, most tree crops and woody plants are
sensitive to sodium and chloride; use the values shown. Most
annual crops are not sensitive; use the salinity tolerance FAO
Paper No. 29. Vlth overhead sprinkler irrigation and low
humidity (< 30 percent), sodium and chloride may be absorbed
through the leaves of sensitive crops. For crop sensitivity to
absorption, see Tables 18, 19 and 20 FAO Paper No. 29, 1985.
e     For boron tolerances, see FAO Paper No. 29, 1985.
NO3-N means nitrate nitrogen reported in terms of elemental
nitrogen (NH4-N and Organic-N should be included when waste
water is being tested).
The interpretation of the guidelines is well documented in FAO
Paper No. 29, 1985 which also includes more details on chemical
limits (particularly trace elements) for irrigation waters which are
summarised in Table 9.2.4 below.

The above table shows the constituent limits using domestic
wastewater. Industrial effluent however, could have very harmful
chemicals and generally should not be used for irrigated
agriculture. It would be necessary to ascertain the nature of the
chemicals and the degree of dilution of industrial effluent before
making a decision for reuse of such waters. At present industrial
effluent from Sana'a is believed to be insignificant.
9.2.4 Treated Effluent Supplies
9.2.4.1 Treatment Process Design
The design of the treatment plant has been described in detail in
Section 4 of this design report. The important parameters at the
plant outlet will be BOD better than 30 mgl and SS better than 30
mgl with disinfection to reduce faecal coliforms below 200 per
100 ml, which is within WHO guidelines for the irrigation of all
categories of crops given on Table 9.2.2, except in respect of
removal of Intestinal Nematodes which may not always be
achieved.
9.2.4.2 Quantities of Treated Effluent for Re-use
The new plant will be designed to an ultimate capacity of 50,000
m3/day, i.e. 580 I/s average with flows varying between a normal
daily peak of 1100 I/s down to 180 I/s using the same diurnal
flow profile as the existing plant The diurnal variation in flow
would be significant and. consideration of storage would--be
required to suit irrigation practice.
It is possible that the new plant will be built to provide a capacity
of 25,000 m3/day (290 I/s) as a first stage.
Irrigation development should accordingly be staged to suit the
phasing of the plant.
9.2.5 Agiculture
9.2.5.1 .Cropping
There are four key issues to be addressed when using treated
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREP.AO1                                   Page 61.



effluent for irrigated agriculture.
- The supply is generally constant throughout the year and
without costly storage being provided perennial crops need to
be considered in order to match consumption with supply.
- Crop selection should take into account the chemical quality of
the effluent and the potential health risks as set out in the FAO
and WHO guidelines.
- Operation and maintenance of the scheme should be 'kept
simple to ensure human contract vith the effluent is kept to a
minimum.
- Gravity methods of furrow and basin are preferable to
pressurised systems.
In addressing the above issues consideration is given to the
following perennial crops as most suitable to be irrigated.
- Trees - orchards fruit trees, citrus, nuts, eucalyptus and conifer
for woodlots (there is a shortage of firewood in Sana'a).
- Cereals - wheat barley sorghum
- Fodder - alfalfa, grasses for hay, etc.
Depending on market demands some annual cropping of
vegetables and legume crops could also be considered
intercropped between perennial crops.
9.2.5.2 Crop Water Requirements
a) Potential Evapotranspiration (Eto)
The Surface Vater Resources Final Report 1992 by UNDP gives
potential Evapotranspiration (Eto) -calculated using the Penman
method for several centres throughout the Republic of Yemen.
The annual total for Sana'a was calculated to he .2-050 mm but
no figures were available on a monthly basis.
By using data from the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority
averaged over the period of record 1983 to 1989, we have
undertaken an estimation of potential evapotranspiration on a
monthly basis using the Blaney Griddle method. The annual
total calculated to be 1791 mm. Penman gives a more accurate
estimate than Blaney-Griddle hence the monthly Blaney Griddle
values have been increased in the ratio of 2050/1791 as shown
in Table 9.2.5 below.
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREP.AOI                                   Page 62.

b) Crop Coefficients (Kc)
With reference to "Crop Water Requirements" FAO No. 24, crop
factors for the above range of perennial crops range from 0.95
to 1.05. In order to provide wide flexibility in the range of
crops to be grown it is proposed to adopt a crop factor of 1.05
throughout the year.
c) Crop Water Requirements
Based on the above Eto and Kc values and neglecting any
effective rainfall the monthly crop water requirements have been
calculated as shown in Table 9.2.6 for a gravity supply system
serving furrows or basins an overall efficiency factor of 55% has
been adopted.

9.2.5.3  Scheme Areas
Based on the peak requirement of 1.62 I/s/ha in June the plant
supply of 290 I/s in Stage I would irrigate 179 ha. But this only
occurs for one month. It is more realistic to adopt a design
module of 1.26 l/s/ha being an approximate annual average,
which would give a net irrigated area of 230 ha. The reason for
this is that there would be sufficient area to accommodate
84.333.0/Aw/3113/DESREP.Aol                                              Page 63.



fluctuations and any oversupply from the plant. Also any under
supply of 20% to perennial crops in the months of May, June and
July would be unlikely to create stress problems. Hence the Stage
I irrigation area should be designed for 230 ha (250 ha gross)
extending to an ultimate size of 460 ha (500 ha gross) when the
treatment plant reaches full capacity of 580 1/s.
9.2.5.4 Existing Farming
Effluent from the existing temporary treatnent plant has been
used by local farmers to grow a corn crop in the waadi. Local
farmers adjacent to the airport are also using wells to grow
fodder crops such as alfalfa and vegetable crops. Hence there is
already experience of irrigated agriculture in the area and
particularly effluent reuse.
It is vital that any proposed formal irrigation system using effluent
from the plant should take full account of existing farming
systems, plot sizes, crop types, irrigation methods, social attitudes
and marketing aspects.
The detailed designs of a scheme would need to take full
consideration of these social issues. It is the farmers who will be
using the effluent and for maximum sustainable benefits to be
achieved full account must be taken of farmer aspirations and
needs.
9.2.5.5 Irrigation Methods
From our reconnaissance surveys, enxsting irrigation practised in
the waadi is based on channels serving 1 to 2 ha units utilising
furrow or basin methods. The topography is most suitable for
- -     surface irrigation. It is therefore proposed that similar methods
to those being used be adopted for any new scheme. The
methods are cheap, conform to existing traditions and there is no
justification to use more costy pressurised sprinkler or drip
systems.
9.2.6 Conceptual Effluent Re-use Scheme
9.2.6.1 Conveyance System
A schematic layout of a possible Stage I scheme of 250 ha (gross)
is shown in Figure 7. Design concepts are:
- The central waadi channel should remain :untouched as the
natural drainage channel.
- Bunding should be provided either side of the waadi channel to

- The main canal from the treatment plant will have an average
capacity of 580 I/s and be approximately 200 m long. It would
bifurcate into two primary canals with a capacity of 290 I/s each
running parallel with each other down the contour along the
perimeter of the scheme. The right bank primary canal would
pass under the waadi in a syphon and embankment combination
from the bifurcator structure.
- The distance between the two parallel primary canals has been
taken as 400 m each side of the waadi channel.
- Each primary canal would be concrete lined with a control and
drop structure every 500 m.
- Primary Control Structures would serve secondary canals of
average capacity 25 I/s running down the contours and serving
20 ha blocks. Secondary canals would be unlined.
- Tertiary outlets would be provided every 40 m along secondary
canals to serve up to 2 ha units.
- All controls would be simple steel lift gates, or stop logs.
- Structures would be either reinforced concrete or block work.
- Farm access roads would be provided along all primary and
secondary canals.
The scheme has been designed on a modular basis so that
secondary blocks can be built as and when necessary in a
northerly direction, either side of the wvaadi.
9.2.6.2 Scheme Operation
The scheme is designed to operate on a continuous or rotational
flow basis. Primary and secondary-canals would maintain their
design capacity cross sections throughout to permit rotational
operation at tertiary level.
Moreover the primary canals should be designed to full capacity
to permit extension of the scheme to its ultimate size of 500 ha
(gross).
Diurnal variation of flows through the new plant must be
accommodated in storage ponds to give a controlled discharge to
the irrigation system to suite irrigation prac&iee.

To cater for variation in crop water demands over the year by
storage of effluent in low demand seasons for use in high demand
seasons would require storages of approximately 1.0 million m3
for 250 ha Stage I and double this amount when the scheme
reaches full size. To provide such storage in the waadi would
require a large area, require costly spillway works and put
agricultural land out of commission.
It is therefore considered prudent to over irrigate when supplies
exceed demand. This would be unlikely harm crops and any
surplus would recharge groundwater. The porosity of the soils
would not impede drainage but the water table would need to be
carefully monitored during the life of the scheme. High water
tables could create salinity conditions with consequent crop
failures.
9.2.6.3 Provisional Capital Costs
Based on the scheme concepts each component of the Stage I
scheme is listed in Table 9.2.7 below. Provisional quantities have
been estimated and costs derived using international contractor's
rates currently applicable for Yemen.

9.2.7 Implications of Using Treated Effluent
9.2.7.1 Nutrients and Chemical Constituents
The nutrients in reclaimed municipal wastewaters provide
fertiliser benefits to crop development but in certain instances are
in excess of plant needs and may cause problems related to
excessive vegetative growth, delayed or uneven maturity, or
reduced quality. Periodic checking is needed to estimate the
amount of nutrients being applied. These amounts should then
be included as part of the fertiliser application.  Nutrients
occurring in quantities important to agricultural management
include nitrogen and phosphorous and occasionally potassium,
zinc, boron and sulphur. The most beneficial and the most
frequendy excessive nutrient is nitrogen.
Total nitrogen includes NH4-N, NO3-N, No2N and organic N. The
nitrogen is reclaimed wastewater that reaches the field in
irrigation water is essentially equal to fertiliser nitrogen but is not
easily regulated. At each irrigation, nitrogen is applied along with
the water and fertilises the crop. This is beneficial in the early
stages of growth but much less beneficial towards maturity. In
some cases, nitrogen can be excessive, stimulates excessive
vegetative growth, and may delay maturity or reduce crop quality.
In other cases, too litde nitrogen may be present and
supplemental fertiliser nitrogen would be needed for satisfactory
crop yields. Hence it will be important to monitor nitrogen levels
at field level in order to estimate fertiliser requirements during
operation of the Scheme.
9.2.7.2 Handling of Treated Effluent for Irrigation
In general high soil moisture contents, low temperature, high soil
Ph and the presence of organic matter will tend to increase
survival time of any pathogenic organisms contained in sewage
effluent. In spite of provision of disinfection these factors make
it all the more essential that adequate safety standards are adopted
and moreover adhered to.
Crops to be irrigated can be divided into two categories: those
84.333.0/Aw/3113/DESREP.AO1                                      Page 67.



grown for forage and fodder for animal consumption and those
for human consumption. The latter can be subdivided into crops
eaten raw and those normally cooked before being eaten.
In all cases irrigation should not be permitted for at least 7 days
prior to harvesting. In the case of forage and fodder harvesting
handling is likely to be largely mechanical, thus reducing the
hazards to farm workers. Moreover, any residual bacteria in the
effluent transferred to crops is destroyed within the animals
digestive system forming a second barrier to disease transmission
to humans.
Should vegetables be considered in addition to perennial
orchards, care should be taken to ensure they are well cooked
before eaten. In addition, drying and storing many such crops
would normally remove most pathogenic risks. Vegetables eaten
raw provide the greatest danger to human health and irrigation
with sewage effluent should be avoided. If treated effluent is used
on such crops then they should preferably be irrigated only by a
non contact system such as ridged furrows but great handling
care is needed. When the scheme is established and there is a
market demand, there are good arguments for placing greater
emphasis on the cultivation of crops requiring some form of
manufacturing process before use (i.e. tomato paste/juice,
sunflower and castor). This would reduce the need for rigorous
high standards in treated effluent quality.
9.2.7.3 Effluent Quality Control
Although the design of the treated effluent is to be governed by
prescribed WHO and FAO standards the success of any scheme
will be determined by the control of the quality and quantity of
the effluent outflow within these limits. Adequate facilities and
manpower must therefore be made available to ensure quality
control is effective continuously.
9.2.7.4 Groundwater Pollution
There are a number of wells used for irrigation and potable water
purposes located adjacent to the waadi downstream of the
treatment plant site.
Up until late 1993 the effluent from the temporary treatment
plant, which is of very poor quality, flowed in the waadi past the
new treatment plant site and downstream of the site where it was
abstracted and used for irrigation. Flows in the waadi caused
pollution of the adjacent wells, mainly, it is believed, due to
inadequate lining and sealing of the upper parts of the wells
allowing polluted groundwater to seep into the wells.
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREPA01                                     Page 68.



The wells within the zone of influence of any irrigation or effluent
disposal area should be properly lined and sealed to a depth of
around 50 metres to prevent pollution, which should be carefully
monitored.
9.3   Sludge Disposal
9.3.1 Sludge Characteristics
The proposed treatment plant will produce waste solids in the
form of sludge. At the design flows of 50,000 m3/d about 80
tonnes/day of dried sludge at a moisture content of 30% will be
produced.
The sludge will be largely stabilised by aerobic digestion within
the activated sludge plant and will be given further treatment by
thickening and drying on beds before storage/composting for 6
months in a sludge storage area.
This process of treatment will render the sludge dry, inoffensive
and odour free with the appearance of loamy soil. The treatment
and storage processes will render the sludge essentially free of
pathogens.
During storage, the sludge should be placed in windro'ws
approximately 2 metres high and turned over with a tractor
shovel from time to time to encourage the composting process.
9.3.2 Land Application
The composted sludge will be suitable for land application by
manure spreader when it will h-ave the following advantages:
* Low cost fertiliser
* Soil improvement by reducing the density of the soil
* Improved moisture retention.
The sludge will typically be 30% solids having a content of 2%
nitrogen, 1% phosphorous and 0.15% potassium.
Land application of dried sludge is a well established and
successful process used worldwide. The fertiliser is of low
strength, easily applied and has reduced nitrate leaching
characteristics.
Typical application rates used in central United States of America
are around 50-70 tonnes of composted sludge per hectare.
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREP.AO1                                   Page 69.



9.3.3 Regulating Considerations
Whenever sludge is re-used it is necessary to consider regulation
and safeguards. Sludge management is currently a matter of
considerable debate throughout the world. For example, in the
United States long-standing sludge management regulations are
currently in the process of being revised. The revisions have
been under preparation, review and debate for several years.
Consensus between the regulators and those regulated has not
been easy to achieve. In Europe, European Community directives
regarding sludge management are under development.
Despite the continuing debate regarding regulation of sludge
management throughout the world, a number of general duties
are available from this experience. Regulations will generally
address the following:
*  Pathogen destruction
'. Heavy metal content
* Toxicity of extractable material
A  Vector attraction
*  General nuisances associated with management practices.
Pathogen destruction and vector attraction are generally effectively
controlled by adequate sludge stabilisation as is proposed at the
treatment plant.
The current USA regulations provide useful guidelines for initial
planning. In those regulations, a number of processes including
composting processes have been defined in national regulations
as a "Process to Significantly Reduce Pathogens (PSRP)". Sludge
that is to be applied to land must be treated with a PSRP, human
access must be controlled for 12 months, and grazing animal
access must be prevented for at least 1 month. Sludge that is to
be applied to land that is used for producing crops for human
consumption within 18 months after application must be treated
with a 'Process to Further Reduce Pathogens (PFRP)". These
processes involve elevated temperatures that are achieved either
naturally (such as composting or thermophilic aerobic digestion)
or using external heat sources (such as heat drying or heat
treatment). Other processes can be used as PFRPs if they can be
demonstrated to provide acceptable reduction of pathogens and
vector attraction.
Heavy metals content and toxicity are primarily determined by the
portion of wastewater that comes from industries and the types of
industrial dischargers. It is currently expected that few industries
will discharge to the WWTP, so the content of heavy metals and
the toxicity potential of the sludge should be minimal.
84.333.O/AW/3113/DBSREPAO1                                    Page 70.



Appropriate regulations are needed to control the introduction of
these materials into the sewerage system if beneficial use of the
sludge is to be practised. Current USA regulations and guidelines
specifically control annual application of cadmium and cumulative
application of cadmium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc.
Control of nuisance conditions requires proper selection, design
and operation of facilities used for the various steps in sludge
management   Nuisance  conditions that are  sometimes
encountered during sludge management operations include
odour, unsighdiness, e.g., due to leaking transport vehicles, iloise
and dust.  Regulations typically require that such nuisance
conditions not occur beyond the boundary of the facility used for
sludge management operations (examples of which might include
the  VWWTP boundary, the edge of a field used for agricultural
application of sludge, or the perimeter of a sludge composting
facility).
Given certain safeguards as outlined above, agricultural utilisation
of the sludge should be of mutual benefit to agriculture and the
operation of the wastewater treatment plant
9.4   Occupational Hazards
Sewage Treatment Plants present a number of occupational
hazards which can be safeguarded against by design of the
facilities and by good working practices.
Particular hazards which may be encountered include:
*  Infection
+  Asphyxiation
*  Drowning
+  Electrocution
* Chemical hazards
9.4.1 Infection
Sewage is polluted with infectious bacteria, viruses, cysts, ova and
parasites which could be harmful to the operators if basic care is
not taken.
Operators should avoid contact with the liquid by wearing gloves
and protective footwear and by rigorous attention to personal
hygiene.
A supply of protective clothing, including laundered overalls,
should be issued to all operators who should be required to wear
them whilst employed on the site.
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREP.A01                                  Page 71.



All staff should be given instruction, both verbal and wTitten, on
health and hygiene requirements on the site.
A supply of operational and maintenance protective clothing will
be included in the contract for the construction of the treatment
plant.
In general, given reasonable precautions, sewage treatment works
operators have a low incidence of infectious diseases and this is
not a high risk.
9.4.2 Asphyxiation
Asphyxiation is a high risk in sewage treatment works due to the
presence of confined spaces in which noxious gases can build up
and operators can be overcome by fumes.
Typical risk areas include manholes, chambers, pump sumps, etc.
Rigorous procedures must be established for defining confined
spaces and for entering confined spaces. These will require that
all confined spaces be identified with notices and that entry into
these can only take place after testing for injurious gases and lack
of oxygen has been carried out All entries must be made by
teams comprising at least 2 operators, one of whom remains
outside or at the surface, equipped with adequate safety
equipment.
The supply of suitable safety equipment will be included in the
construction contract.
9.4.3 Drowning
Drowning is an occupation hazard due to the presence of tanks
and channels containing deep water.  Aeration tanks are
particularly dangerous due to the reduced density of the aerated
water which causes persons to sink.
Careful design of access and guardrailing together with awareness
by the operators are the key factors in preventing drowning.
9.4.4 Electrocution
All of the treatment units are powered by electric motors and
operated using electrical control equipment. Electricity in a wet
environment is a well known hazard which could lead to
electrocution without proper safeguards.
Safeguards include the design and specification of the electrical
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREPAol                                     Page 72.



equipment to suit the environment and with specific safety
provisions together with the training of the operators in the use
of electrical equipment.
Installation and maintenance of all electrical equipmnent should be
carried out by trained electrical specialists. Unauthorised entry
to electrical equipment should be prevented by locking devices
and strict procedures.
9.4.5 Chemicals
A number of chemicals which could be used on sewage treatment
plants are hazardous and care must be taken to ensure that
operators are made aware of these and of the precautions to be
adopted.
Chlorine is likely to be the most hazardous chemical with the
biggest risk at Sana'a SIW. The chlorine store will be provided
with gas monitoring equipment, automatic alarms and a drench
shower as safety provisions, but it is essential that the operators
of the chlorination plant are given proper training in the
procedures and safety measures to be adopted with chlorine.
This especially applies to the handling of chlorine drums, both
full and empty.
Given reasonable precautions and proper procedures chlorine is
safe and efficient as has been proved in countless thousands of
installations throughout the world.
9.5   Power Failure
The consequences of prolonged power failure include:
* Overflowing of untreated sewage into the waadi
* Breakdown of the aerobic treatment process
*  Die-off of aerobic bacteria in the activated sludge leading to
poor performance on re-starting of the electrical supply.
*  Gross pollution and odour.
The electrical load at the treatment plant is significant and for this
reason full standby generation is proposed which will
automatically start up and restore supply in case of mains failure.
9.6   Airport'
The main treatment units will be some 500 m away from the line
84.333.0/AW/3113/DESREP.A01                                   P2ge 73.



of the main runway and will not have any adverse physical effect
upon operation or safety.
Odour will be controlled and the process used will not have an
impact on the airport
Small birds are likely to be attracted by the sludge drying beds
but, with the absence of polishing ponds, large birds are unlikely
to be attracted.
Street lighting and flood lighting will be designed to avoid aerial
glare.

The following guidelines are prepared for Pre construction and Construction operations.
These are preliminary guidelines and as the project develops may be subject to revision.
E.1 BUILDING DEMOLMON
No building demolition works are proposed at this stage. If during the course of his works the
contractor requires to demolish a structure he must notify NWSA in good time to allow for
the necessary procedures and authorisations to be obtained.
No structure shall be demolished without approval from NWSA.
E.2       DEFINITION OF SITE ACCESS
All access routes to and within the site will be clearly marked and where they are not existing
public rights of way, clearly demarcated within as narrow a right of way as is practical given
the anticipated vehicle use characteristics.
The aligmnent and profile of construction access roads shall be subject to the approval of
NWSA. In approving the alignment, profile and ultimately the construction of such roads
during the detailed design stage, NWSA shall consider the long term potential use of the road.
In cases where no long term life is anticipated the aligmnent and profile shall be considered
bearing in tnind the ease with which the road can be retumed to its previous use or new use.
E.3       CONSTRUCTION ACIVITIES
E.3.1     General
Work shall be carried out in such a manner that there is no damage to or interference with:
* existing watercourses or drainage systems;
X utilities;

*  public or private vehicular or pedestrian access;
other than to the extent that is necessary for them to be removed or diverted to permit the
execution of the works within the defined operational perimeter.
Any facilities disturbed or damaged directly or indirectly due to the Contractor's operations
shall be restored to the original condition. The Contractor shall discuss his restoration plans
with the owners concerned prior to the start of restoration work to obtain the agreement of
the owners concerned.

works carried out shall conform to all utility authority requirements.
After co-ordination with the utility agencies involved, field checks of utility data, and obtaining
additional data, as necessary, and before starting, a utilities work plan will be prepared. These
plans will address:
(a) Utilities proposed for temporary support in-place and subsequent restoration.
(b) Temporary relocation with subsequent permanent restoration in-place with the removal or
abandonment of the temporary facility.
(c) Permanent relocation with existing facility to be removed or abandoned in-place.
(d) Measures to ensure continuity of operation of the affected utilities in a safe manner.
(e) Procedures to maintain the affected utilities to ensure safety and unhindered function of
each utility.
(f) Whether the work will be performed by the utility authority or the Contractor.

the work to be carried out.
E.3.2.2Maintenance of Existing Access
(i)    Public Rights of Way (ROW)
Prior to performing works affecting public ROWs, a traffic management plan must be
submitted to the relevant authorities for approval. Relevant authorities in this case include but
are not necessarily limited to the Road 'owner' and in the case of public highways the Police.
As a minimum this must comprise:

These shall be developed in accordance with the conditions and restrictions imposed by the
relevant authorities and include details of:
*   Diversion routes
*   Temporary lighting, signing, guarding and traffic control arrangements
Temporary traffic arrangements and control shall be inspected and maintained regularly, both
by day and night. Lights and signs shall be kept clean and easy to read. Equipment which is
damaged, dirty, incorrectly position or not in working order shall be repaired or replaced
immediately.
(b)   Construction Traffic Control
Site managers, supervisors and workers shall be made aware of the requirements outlined in a
Traffic Control Plan. This shall contain as a minimum:
*   Details of traffic types permitted to use surfaced roads on the site and leading to the site.
In preparing this plan it should be noted that tracked vehicles shall not be permitted to use
any surfaced road unless protection against damage is provided or the surface is replaced
prior to reopening for public use.
-  Proposals for minimising the transfer of excavated and construction materials to public
roads.
As a minimum this will require that:
v ehicles leaving the site are loaded in such a manner that excavated material, mud or
debris will not be deposited on roads and dust emissions are minimised.
on exiting the site the wheels of all vehicles shall be washed in proper washing pits
with adequate drainage when necessary to avoid the deposit of mud and debris on
roads.
(c)   Details of Emergency Service Access
24-hour access to adjoining properties, will always be available for emergency services.
(d)   Plans for the Reinstatement of Public Roads and Footways
Temporary diversions, pedestrian access and lighting, signing, guarding and traffic control
equipment shall be removed immediately they are no longer required. Roads, footways and
other items affected by temporary traffic arrangements and control shall be reinstated to the
same condition as existed before the work started immediately after the relevant work is
complete.
On completion of works, and in addition to the requirements contained elsewhere, all work
areas shall be smoothed and graded in a manner to conform to the natural appearance of the
surrounding landscape.

Copies of documents containing the approved arrangements shall be kept on the site at all
times.
(ii)   Private Access
Alternative access shall be provided if interference with existing private vehicular or pedestrian
access is necessary to enable the works to be carried out. The arrangements for the alternative
access shall be agreed with the relevant authorities prior to any works being undertaken.
Unless agreed otherwise, the permanent access shall be reinstated as soon as practicable after
work is complete and the alternative access shall be removed immediately it is redundant and
ground surfaces appropriately reinstated.
E.3.3        Use of Highways and Public Rights of Way
E.3.3.lRestrictions on Use of Public Highways
Public or private rights of way will not be used for depositing or storing plant or materials,
other than such plant, materials, tools or implements as shall from time to time be required for
immediate use on sections of work. Plant, materials and temporary works shall be placed in
such a way as to cause minimum interference with the use of any right of way by the public.
Those parts of the right of way not temporarily occupied by the works must be maintained in a
clear, passable and safe state at all times.
E.3.3.2Road Cleaning
Road cleaning measures will be required to ensure that public rights of way utilised are kept in
a safe condition, that surplus oil, mud and other materials are removed on a regular basis. The
contractor will therefore be required to submit a programme of road cleaning for approval
and subsequent implementation.
In addition the Contractor shall control mud and dust 'deposits', by using water troughs at all
vehicular exit points.
E.3.3.3Access Control
Access control will require the restriction of turning movements to approved access points to
and from existing highways and, if necessary, temporary improvement to existing junction
layouts to reduce the potential for accidents. It may also require restrictions on the timing of
use, with construction traffic prohibited, outside of specified, supervised hours.
Prior to commencement of the site works the contractor shall be required to submit to NWSA
a plan oudining:
the location of proposed site, entry and access points, and or points of access to the
primary road network
additional traffic control measures required, e.g., temporary traffic lights or modified
junction layouts

laws, related to safety, security and accident prevention.
E.3.5 Noise Control
In general, the Contractor shall comply with all requirements for noise control in accordance
with the standards in force in Yemen and failing that WVB or WHO guidelines as appropriate,
and with the requirements of the local authorities. If any noise level gives rise to public
complaints, it shall be treated as a nuisance in accordance with the relevant legislation and the
Contractor shall take immediate steps to mitigate the problem.
Workmen and others present in the vicinity of noise generating sources or operations,
particularly those working in trenches or other confined areas, shall be provided with
protective devices such as ear muffs.
Construction vehicles shall be properly maintained and monitored for any loud and excessive
noise. Worldng hours shall be limited to daytime and normal working days only except with
the written consent of NWSA and the contractor should ensure that plant operated
intermittently is shut down, or at a minimum throttled down during idle periods.
E.3.6        Air Pollution
E.3.6.1 Dust abatement
(a)   Main Site
During the performance of the works the contractor shall furnish all the labour, equipment,
materials and means required, and shall carry out proper and efficient measures, wherever and
as often as necessary, to prevent dust that has originated from his operations from damaging
any crops and dwellings in the vicinity of operations.
The contractor will be held liable for any damages resulting from dust originating from his
operations.
In cases where direct abstraction from an existing water course may be required for potable or
service water requirements, the following will be the subject of approval and monitoring by
NWSA.

emissions. Water shall be lightly sprayed on exposed ground during dry and windy periods.
E.3.6.20ther Atmospheric Pollution
(i)    In operating equipment, the contractor shall utilise all practical methods and devices
as are reasonably available to control, prevent and otherwise minimise atmospheric
emissions or the discharge of air contaminants. Equipment and vehicles that show
excessive emissions of particulates due to poor engine adjustment or other inefficient
operating conditions shall not be operated unless corrective measures are taken.
(ii)    The contractors methods of handling cement and pozzoloid shall include means of
eliminating atmospheric discharges.
(iii)    Burning of materials resulting from the clearance of trees, bushes and combustible
materials shall not be permitted.
E.3.7         Prevention of Water Pollution
E.3.7.1General Construction Wastes
The contractor's construction activities shall be performed by methods that will prevent
entrance or accidental spillage, of solid matter, contaminants, debris, and other objectionable
pollutants and wastes in to underground water sources. Such pollutants and wastes include,
but are not restricted to; refuse, cement, concrete, industrial waste and aggregate tailings.
In the unlikely event of a serious spill, and / or contamination, the contractor shall notify
NWSA immediately. Any remedial works required by the executing agency shall be
undertaken by the contractor. Failure to notify NWSA of such spills will be considered a
breach of contract by the contractor.

E.3.7.2Wastewaters
(i)    Domestic wastewaters
No wastewater of a domestic nature may be directly discharged The contractor shall consult
with NWSA and agree on the number, nature and location of any temporary on site-cleansing
facilities. Once this has been agreed the contractor shall provide NWSA with a programme for
wastewater collection and disposal for approval.
In approving these programmes NWSA shall ensure that:
-     tlhe locations of facilities are such as to minimise the risk of direct discharge of
wastewaters into shallow aquifers
-     any equipment utilised for collection and disposal (if required) is of a suitable type
-     operators of such equipment are appropriately trained in its use and are suitably
protected against public health risks.
(ii)   Industrial Wastewaters
Any industrial wastewater generated on site shall be disposed of in accordance with the
requirements of the authorities.
E.3.8        Prevention of Soil Pollution
The threat of direct soil pollution from spills of potentially harmfiul materials is considered to
be relatively insignificant. However, the contractor shall be required to perform all
construction activities by methods that will prevent pollution of the soil by accidental spillage,
of solid matter, contaminants, debris, and other objectionable pollutants. If a significant
spillage does occur the contractor will remove all contaminated soil to a site specified by
NWSA for disposal and where necessary appropriate replacement material shall be laid.
E.3.9        Storaee and DisDosal of Waste Materials
E.3.9.lGeneral
All debris, spoil material, rubbish and other waste, except excavated soil and rock, shall be
cleared regularly from the site, underground areas and other structures under construction and
as directed.
E.3.9.2Refuse
An adequate number of bins, (in line with NWSA waste management procedure guidelines),
shall be provided by the Contractor for storage of inorganic waste such as building litter,
refuse, rubbish, timber, boxes, etc. For organic waste, separate covered bins of adequate
capacity shall be provided. These materials shall be collected on a regular basis and taken to a
disposal site approved by NWSA.
In addition, the contractor shall maintain and clean up all working areas and temporary
buildings on a regular basis and shall at all times keep access to the work sites free of all
debris, waste and excavated material and other obstructions.

No off site dumping of waste materials shall occur without the approval of NWSA.
E.3.10       Manaaement of Aggreeate. Fill and SPoil, Heaps
The contractor shall wherever possible ensure that all such heaps shall be of a size and stability
that will ensure that the risk of mass movement in periods of high intensity rainfall will be
minimised.
E.3.11       Site Access Routes
E.3.11.1     Construction
In the construction of site access routes the contractor shall comply with the general
construction guidelines outlined above.
E.3.11.2     Operation during construction
Movement of crews and equipment to and from the site shall be confined to marked areas and
shall be required to be performed in a manner that will prevent damage to property, productive
lands and known cultural or archaeological sites. Where unnecessary destruction, scarring or
defacing of landscape, natural vegetation or productive lands has occurred the contractor shall
be responsible for repair, replanting or otherwise correction at their own cost.
E.3.11.3     Making Good
All access routes to the site will be made good to one of the following standards:
-      !integration into the project infiastructure as a road.
-     rrevegetated within the context of the project requirements
-     made impassable and retuned to its original condition
No road shall be left as a bare surface.
E.3.12       Site Offices. Material Storaee and EquiDment Holdine Areas
In establishing site offices, equipment holding areas or material storage areas on the main, the
contractor will address the following issues.
E.3.12.1     Location
The selection of the site for the equipment holding area will require considerable care and
attention. In general terns the site should be located:
-     with easy access to existing primary roads
-     within easy access of the construction sites
-     sufficiently distant from any receptor to eliminate noise nuisance
-     sufficiently distant from any receptor to eliminate dust nuisance
-     to minimise any pollution threat to surface or groundwaters.

Sana 'a Waiter Supply and Saitation Se,vices          Sanaa I Environmental Impact Assessment
The contractor shall submit to NWSA plans for any such areas to be located within the site.
E.3.12.2     Health and Safety
The layout any facility that is intended for use as a materials storage facility or a refuelling
point must be submitted to NWSA for approval prior to construction.
Operations within these facilities will be subject to health and safety regulations. All such sites
shall also be secured to prevent casual unauthorised access.
A mandatory periodic inventory control of all fuels, lubricants and chemicals to be used will be
required.
E.3.12.3     Utilities
Such facilities may need utilities provision, especially power and water supplies. The former
shall aLmnost certainly from generators that should be place on hard stands and housed in
appropriate structures. They should also be located to minimise the potential of significant
noise nuisance.
Water supplies shall not be abstracted from shallow boreholes that may modify shallow
groundwater regimes and thereby interfere with local community supplies. NWSA shall be
required to approve proposals for any on site water supply systems.
E.4 OFF SITE WORKS
This section deals with the off site works associated with the project, specifically:
-     Construction camps utilised
-     Raw material extraction points
-     Construction sites
E.4.1        Construction CamUs
Though it is likely that the contractor's main camp(s) will be remote from the project site it
too shall be subject to the EMP. NWSA, at present enforce a strict public health and safety
regime on contractors operating on their sites. The Contractor shall be bound to apply these or
equivalent regulations on his sites. In addition the contractor shall be required to:
-     ensure that all domestic / office waste generated are appropriately disposed off,
preferably recycled.
-     recover, treat and re use materials, in particular lubricants where possible.
-     dispose of domestic wastewaters in an approved manner
-     dispose of industrial wastes-in an appropriate manner
-     submit to the NWSA an inventory of the materials to be stored on site, together with a
preliminary indication of the quantities of material that may be present at any one time.
(Clearly these indications of quantity will by necessity, be indicative only).

submit to NWSA a plan for the storage and handling of such materials. It is expected
that this will include, at a minimum, specific operational requirements such as, the
definition of any materials to be isolated from each other, details on the use of
protective clothing and equipment by employees, details of approved handling
techniques, and other safety requirements, ventilation, firefighting equipment.
have in place and operate a HAZOPs plan approved by NWSA
have in place an Emergency Response Plan approved by NWSA.
E.4.2         Sources Of Raw Materials (A!erecates)
In general terms it is considered that the impacts on the environment from raw material
extraction,. processing and transport for this project will be limited. This assertion is based on
the following assessment:
-    a review of existing sources of aggregates, indicates that the development of new
extraction sites will not be required. Moreover it is understood that the resources
available at these sites will be sufficient to meet all other regional demands in the
immediate future.
-    all existing facilities are, at present, carrying out the processes required to provide the
necessary materials for the proposed project.
-    the primary routes for the transportation of aggregates are of high quality and already
carry significant proportions of heavy goods traffic.
Accordingly, it is considered that the only significant impact will be the risk of an increase in
road accidents.
The contractor shall therefore be required to pay particular attention to ensuring that all
vehicles utilised in the transport of raw materials are well maintained, loaded appropriately and
that drivers are properly trained.
E.4.3        Construction Sites
In constructing these works, the requirements outlined in Section E.3 shall apply. Specific
measures will however be required in the following areas:
Prior to initiating work on any channel a detailed survey of local pedestrian and vehicular
movement patterns in areas traversed by the channel shall be carried out to determine the
number, location and type (pedestrian vehicular, etc.) of crossings that will be required to
ensure that any potential severance effects are mninimised. In determining the requirement for
crossing facilities NWSA shall consult extensively with affected communities and land users.

APPENDIX G:        SANA'A WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT
TOR: IDA SUPERVISION MISSIONS: ENVIRONMENTAL
ASPECTS
Background. One per year, IDA supervision missions for the Sana'a Water Supply &
Sanitation Project will include a qualified Environmental Specialist (ES) as part of the
supervision team. The ES will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) and Management Plan. While in Sana'a, he will work closely with
the Environment and Safety Officer (ESO) in the Project Management Unit (PMU) and
relevant staff of the Sana'a Resident Mission.
While on supervision mission, the ES will have the following responsibilities:
1. Environmental Audit
The first task of the ES while on mission in Sana'a will be to assist the ESO in performing the
current semi-annual Environmnental Audit. He will review the other semi-annual audit from
outside Yemen, in coordination with the IDA supervision team and the Sana'a Resident
Mission. The Environmental Audit will: (i) assess the project's environmental management
activities; and (ii) the effectiveness of the management plan in fulfiuling GOY environmental
policy. In preparing the audit, project areas perceived as having the highest environmental risk
are stressed. Specifically, the environmental audit will:
* examine compliance with regulatory requirements
* examine line management systems, plant operations, monitoring practices etc.
*  identify current and potential environmental problems especially during the operational
phase of the project
* check the predictions in the ELA and assure the implementations and application of
recommended practices and procedures
* make recommendations for improving implementation of the Management Plan
*  assess the effectiveness of implementing mitigating measures which were identified in the
Environmental Management Plan
*  assess progress on the training program at the WWTP
The ES will also review with the ESO the latest Environmental Audit completed during the
previous six months and make comments as required.
2. Public Consultation
The ES will also attend at least one public meeting about the Project while in Sana'a. These
public meetings are part on the mitigation plan's public consultation process, and are
Drganized by the ESO. They are designed to both inform the public as to the status of the
project, and to elicit feedback from members of the community who are, or may be, effected
by the project's works. It is the responsibility of the ES to ensure that the ESO has scheduled
a meeting during the time that the ES will be in Sana'a.

3. Environmental Report.
Following review of the environmental audits and public meetings, the ESO and ES will work
together to produce the current semi-annual Environment Report. It is envisaged that each
report will have two main sections:
A. Review of Project Performance
This will outline the environmental performance of all agencies involved in the Project;
improvement or deterioration, as measured against baseline indicators in the EIA and
Management Plan. In addition, and if so indicated, new targets could be established.
In the case of new targets, monitoring should permit direct comparison with previous
performance and in the context of defined objectives. If a specific evaluation technique or
framework is not adopted, annual targets for achievement will need to be defined for
subsequent semi-annual environmental reports.
The assessment should draw on the findings of the inspection reports, the enviromnental
audits, public consultation, monitoring programs and environmental audits.
B. Review of Environmental Management Plan
This would comprise a review of all actions undertaken to date within the Project having to do
with the EIA and the Environmental Management Plan. It would include as a minirmum:
-     Progress reports on project and program implementation
-     Comparison to Baseline Indicators
-     Summary report on training programs / workshops held etc.
-     Activity report on the awareness campaign
-     Activity report of site inspections program
-     Activity report from the monitoring and aucht program
As a minimum, the report should also include the following information, which will be
collected during the mitigation plan's monitoring process:

included in the report.
In general terms each report should contain:
- background to the project /program /works
- summary statements of methodologies adopted
- summaries of findings
- analysis of environmental audits
- a statement of lessons learnt
-  any new mitigation measures to be implemented
- recommendations for future works
4. Coordination with the Resident Mission
During the supervision mission, the ES will closely coordinate with the Sana'a Resident
Mission and keep the Resident Mission informed of all scheduled meetings. The ES will also
prepare an "Environmental Management Plan Implementation Summary" annex for the
mission's Memorandum of Understanding.
Before leaving Sana'a, the ES will brief the relevant person in the RM on results of the
mission and make suggestions on items to be monitored by the Resident Mission before the
ES's next visit. These items to be monitored will be contained in a schedule of tasks to be
performed and compared against milestones to monitor progress on project performance.
