A: Program and Project Development Objectives
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The development objectives of the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project are to: (i) address emergency sewer
installation and water network rehabilitation needs in Sana'a; (ii) increase the availability of urgently needed potable
water in the city; (iii) improve the efficiency of water and wastewater services in the city in a physically and
financially sustainable manner; and (iv) prepare the sector for significant private sector participation.
The achievement of these four development objectives would be measured by: (i) installation of 30 kilometers of
sewer pipes and rehabilitation of 27 kilometers of water network; (ii) an increase of approximately 500,000 m3 per
year of sewage treated; (iii) an increase in the production of potable water by 10,000 m3 per day; (iv) the Sana'a
Branch generates enough cash from revenues by the year 2001 to cover O&M costs, debt service and 5 percent of its
following year's investment program; and (v) the Government of Yemen (GOY), no later than March 31, 2002, and
subject to prior approval of the GOY's Council of Ministers and IDA, takes all measures necessary to award a
performance based management contract, a lease (afjfrmage) or a concession for the operation of the Sana'a Branch
of NWSA.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see A nnex 1).
CAS document number. 15286   Date of latest CAS discussion.: Februaty 19, 1996,
Novemnber 4, 1997 (progress report).
IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Yemen focuses on: supporting stabilization, structural reforms and social
protection measures; improving portfolio implementation and sustainability of past and future investments; and
promoting sustainable natural and human resource development. The proposed project would support the third arm
of the CAS strategy, particularly sustainable natural resource development, through more efficient use of available
water resources (including reductions in UFW), and sanitation improvements. In addition, building institutional
capacity in the National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA) to assist it to assume a regulatory function would
support the sustainability of water sector investments. The urban water sector was extensively discussed during the
last Public Expenditure Review (PER) for Yemen in November 1998. As a result of this exercise, the proposed
Sana'a Project was designated an "A" project, which is the GOY's highest priority ranking.
2. Main sector issues and Governmnent strategy.
The urban water and wastewater sector in Yemen faces three major challenges. First, the sector is not on a sound
financial footing, with only one major city covering expenses from revenues (Aden). In general, tariffs have lagged
the rise in costs (especially for energy), administrative expenses have mushroomed, customer management is
unsatisfactory, and financial discipline has been lacking. As a result, there is insufficient cash flow in the sector for
NWSA to cover debt service or provide the counterpart funding needed for new investment (both of these items have
been provided from the central budget for many years).
Second, NWSA suffers from a low managerial and technical capacity. As a result of external factors outside of its
control, salary levels for NWSA employees are at historical lows on a purchasing power basis, and now few highly
trained and qualified people remain in the organization. This has led, in recent years, to a deterioration in NWSA's
performance, documented by several key indicators including: unaccounted for water normally around 50 percent;
the number of staff per 1,000 connections typically over 10; water service coverage ratios of often only 50 percent;
or accounts receivables that are often more than six months of sales.
Finally, the upland regions of the country suffer from an increasing shortage of water. Existing groundwater is being
depleted at a rapid rate, and the exploration and identification of new resources has been plagued by a combination
of complicated hydrogeology, entrenched traditional and tribally based water rights, and the expense of developing



Yemen
Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project            Page 3                           Project Appraisal Document
the limited number of identified altematives. As a result, few concrete solutions have been formulated and the
efforts directed to the problem have been, so far, modest.
The GOY is fully aware of these problems and has fornulated an Urban Water Sector Strategy that lays out a
detailed plan for addressing the formidable challenges ahead (included as Annex 8). In general it has adopted a
decentralization approach for resolving the managerial and financial issues, and created a separate entity, the
National Water Resources Authority (NWRA), to work on the problem of water resources. Specifically, the GOY
envisages corporatism of the sector through the establishment of a series of autonomous regional water and
wastewater corporations, that are wholly state owned but that act independently on a day-to-day basis under formal
regulatory control. These regional corporations would be financially self-sufficient, based on revenues collected
from customers and long-term borrowing for capital investments. Debt service and a portion of capital investments
would be paid from revenues. The strategy calls for the establishment of the regional corporations between the years
2001 and 2007. In order to facilitate private sector involvement, the strategy also specifies that the legal framework
for their creation be in place by December 2001.
As for bulk water, NWRA is charged with identifying and developing sustainable water resources sufficient to meet
the needs of urban areas. NWRA has a centrally-provided budget. In order to try and attract private sector
investment, the GOY's strategy allows for the possibility of private sector participation in the provision of water and
wastewater services.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices.
IDA supports the GOY's overall sector strategy. There is a continuing dialogue on the degree and pace of private
sector participation. While the GOY's idea is to gradually improve the overall management and financial situation
through an extensive re-training of existing personnel, IDA is doubtful that substantive change will be achieved short
of a complete transformation in personnel and business practices. IDA also believes that the speed of private sector
introduction could be accelerated in order to avoid deepening the sector's financial problems, and to ensure technical
and financial viability of the Sana'a Branch in particular.
Within this context, IDA has explored several strategic choices. One choice is to not invest in the sector, and await
the creation of the regional corporations, improvements in management and an amelioration of the overall financial
condition. The advantage would be that IDA sends a clear signal about its expectations and conditions before it will
invest further in the sector. The drawback of this strategy is that it ignores the pressing need for water and
wastewater investment in the country's cities, plus it does not appear to be consistent with IDA's role as a
development agency.
The second altemative is to support the GOY's strategy and time schedule as presented in the Sector Strategy, and to
place an emphasis on technical assistance and the financing of emergency civil works. The biggest risk here is that
already mentioned above, i.e., that the sector's finances would continue to worsen and achieving financial self-
sustainability might happen only over the long run, if ever. In addition, 20 years of experience in Yemen's water and
wastewater sector has demonstrated that there is a real risk that the entire sector could be worse off, not better, in the
year 2007 when the strategy should have been fully implemented.
A third altemative is to recognize that Yemen needs a series of urban water sector projects to address financial and
technical issues, including in other cities besides Sana'a. Thus, under this option, IDA would stay engaged in the
sector, while at the same time strongly advocating for an immediate and substantive change in management ability,
financial performance and the degree of private sector participation. If there was a short-run expectation of such
actions, then IDA could support a limited program of civil works to address pressing environmental problems. If
change then really did take place, IDA would feel comfortable in making much larger investments and could also
consider addressing the problems in cities other than Sana'a. Future investments could be through an Adaptable
Program Credit, which would provide a vehicle for a series of operations with financing triggers based on a well-
defined sector reform strategy.



Yemen
Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project          Page 4                         Project Appraisal Document
One proven way to achieve such a substantial change in operational behavior and finances is to initiate actions to
allow the private sector to take over operation of the Sana'a Branch. Specifically, this project would propose the
implementation in Sana'a of a form of a long-term and mostly self-financing lease arrangement (a form of
affermage), a concession, or a management contract, with an experienced private sector operator or joint venture
partner. However, Yemen has very little experience with private sector participation, its first exposure being an
O&M contract in the power sector only this year.
Therefore, under the third alternative, IDA proposes a three-year Sana'a Project that adopts the following strategy:
*  The Sana'a Branch is legally established as a water and wastewater corporation by 2001, thereby breaking
the operational tie to the national water authority;
*  Operational improvements and efficiency gains are started in the Sana'a Branch through targeted civil
works, the provision of new water sources and a focused program of technical assistance;
*  The GOY, no later than March 31, 2002, and subject to prior approval of the GOY's Council of Ministers
and IDA, takes all measures necessary to award a performance based management contract, a lease
(affermage) or a concession for the operation of the Sana'a Branch of NWSA; and
*  Prepare an Adaptable Program Credit (including institutional and technical components for the cities of Al-
Mukulla, Taiz and Al-Hodeidah). The award of the affermzage, concession or management contract for the
Sana'a Branch would be a condition of IDA Board presentation for the Adaptable Program Credit.
To reduce its investment risk and provide for an exit strategy if required, IDA would limit the size of the Project to
what can be implemented in 36 months, with the major civil works contracts to be completed in the first two years.
It would also make award of the concession, management contract or the affermiage for the Sana'a Branch a
condition of any additional sector investments after this Project closes.
To operationalize this strategy, IDA has already given its no objection to the award of three of the four civil works
contracts, all of which will commence with Credit effectiveness. The fourth major contract, to be tendered during
the last half of 1999, involves borehole drilling and is not expected to take more than 18 months to complete. IDA
has also provided in the Project for the preparation of a "PSP Implementation Plan" to assist the GOY in choosing
the most appropriate form of private sector participation, and it will then finance tender documents for a concession,
management contract or affermage that will be awarded no later than March 2002.

2. Key policy and institutional reforns supported by the project.
The GOY is keen for reform of the sector, particularly given the scarcity of water in the country's upland regions. To
this end the Cabinet, in 1997, approved an Urban Water Sector Policy that: (i) outlines the sector's regulatory
framework, including the responsibilities of NWSA, NWRA, and the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW); (ii)
requires financial sustainability for the sector; (iii) provides for a range of private sector participation opportunities
for the delivery of water and sewerage services, including autonomous regional corporations run on a commercial
basis; and (iv) sets out a mechanism for demand-driven services and community participation. The policy is attached
as Annex 8.
To implement the Policy, the Govemment has taken the following steps:
*  established a financially and operationally autonomous water and wastewater utility for Sana'a;
*  has agreed to complete the legal framework to incorporate this utility by 2001;
*  provided a separate set of financial accounts and an opening balance sheet for the Sana'a Branch (see the
financial model in the Project File);
*  prepared a draft 5-year business plan for the Branch (included in the Project File).

*  defined the Branch's geographical service territory; and
*  established a separate "Executive Board" for the Sana'a Branch, and thereby separated its operational and
financial functions from NWSA Headquarters. The powers and responsibilities of the Executive Board are
modeled after those typically found in the private sector (see Annex 10) and include:
* the approval of financial statements, annual budgets, investment plans and the 5-year Business
Plan;
* the approval of tariffs proposed by the Branch, and then obtaining the Prime Minister's
endorsement for the new tariffs;
* the hiring and performance evaluation of the Branch's top management;
* the selection of the financial auditors;
* approval of the Branch's personnel policies, including salary scales; and
* review of monthly management reports.
The composition of the Executive Board includes eight members, of which two are from the private sector (including
a representative of the local consumer union). The Executive Board met for the first time in January 1999, again in
February 1999, and it is required to meet four times annually.
The GOY also has drafted, with IDA's assistance, TOR for the top five management positions in the Branch and
agreed only to hire qualified applicants for these key posts. The TOR for each position, included in the Project File,
detail the major responsibilities and contain specific performance criteria intended to quickly restore the operational
and financial health of the Branch.
On the financial side, the GOY substantially raised tariffs twice in the last 6 months (by about 136% in July 1998 and
then about 25% in January 1999) and, plans one additional increase for mid-year 1999. With these tariff increases,
the Sana'a Branch expects to cover its 1999 operations and maintenance (O&M) costs from revenues. The GOY has
also agreed that the Branch will additionally cover debt service and a portion of investment from revenues by the end
of 200 1.
3. Benefits and target population.
Benefits:
* Improved sanitary conditions to the target areas within Sana'a;
* Increased bulk water supply;
* Improved operational efficiency of the Sana'a branch of NWSA, which will result in higher revenue generation
and cost recovery; and
* Improved financial management, which will end central govemment budgetary support and provide greater
sustainability of investments.
Target Population: The project will directly benefit the target areas in the following portions of the city:
Area Name                  Investment Type               Characteristic
Akama           Trunk Main Extension, Sewer       High density, medium
Installation, cesspit removal    income
Hasabah          Water network rehabilitation, leak  High density, low income
detection

4. Institutional and implementation arrangetnents.
Executing agency: For most components, the Project's executing agency will be the Sana'a Water Supply &
Sanitation PMU. The water resources' components will be carried out by NWRA, and all sector reform related tasks
will be carried out by the Technical Secretariat for Water Supply and Sanitation Reform (Technical Secretariat)
under the MEW. However, the funds for all activities will be disbursed through the Special Accounts managed by
the PMU.
Project Coordination: The Sana'a Branch Executive Board will have overall responsibility for project coordination.
Day-to-day implementation will be carried out through the PMU, which was established in 1997. Its initial activities
were funded through a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The PMU Director is in place, as well as a part-time
accountant and full-time secretary. Once the work load increases, a management information specialist,
environmental and safety officer, bilingual support staff, and additional office equipment will be provided in order to
facilitate effective preparation, monitoring and implementation of the Project. The Project Director reports directly
to the new Sana'a Branch Executive Board. Once the Project is effective, the Project Director will also be
responsible for monitoring performance indicators during the implementation period.
Proioect oversiglht an(d polici guidance: Oversight of the Project will be the responsibility of the MEW. The
Technical Secretariat in the Ministry of Electricity and Water is responsible for sector reform oversight and policy
guidance on the reform agenda. It also has implementation responsibilities under the Project for components related
to the reform agenda. The Technical Secretariat is supported by GTZ, which also funds expatriate experts to assist
the Chairman.
Accounting,financial 1*epo*tinig anld auditing arrangemients: The PMU has established project accounts, installed
appropriate accounting/budgetary and management information systems, and it has for each year of project
implementation prepared a budget for its operational costs. It has also hired a part-time accountant (to be made full-
time when the work load so merits). A Financial Management Manual which documents the operation of the
Project's Financial Management System has been prepared. The Manual covers the following aspects: (i) flow of
funds, (ii) financial and accounting policies: (iii) accounting system and internal control mechanisms; (iv) Chart of
Accounts; (v) financial reporting (including formats of financial management reports); (vi) auditing arrangements;
(vii) budgeting; and (viii) organization and staffing for financial management functions.
The PMU and the Sana'a Branch would be subject to annual audits by independent auditors in accordance with
intemationally accepted standards. The audits would complement the semi-annual supervision reviews, which would
determine the applicability of working procedures (as detailed in the Manual of Procedures) and assess the overall
performance of the PMU. During negotiations, the GOY agreed that auditor(s) acceptable to IDA would be selected
by September 1, 1999 and maintained for the entire project period; annual audit reports would be submitted within 6
months from the end of the reporting period; financial budgets and forecasts would be submitted within 15 days
following each quarter; and the audit reports would include separate statements for the Special Account and
documents used to support reimbursements received under LACI.
Special Accounits: To facilitate disbursement against eligible expenditures, NWSA has opened a Special Account for
foreign exchange at the Central Bank, which is operated by the PMU. The GOY also agreed at negotiations to open
a local currency Special Account, to be used for the GOY's counterpart contribution, and to be funded by the GOY.
Components implemented by NWRA and the TS will use the Special Accounts operated by the PMU for
disbursements.
LACIIhnplentenzationt: This project will use the Project Management Reports (PMR)-based disbursement system
under LACI within one year from the date of effectiveness. A simplified disbursement of funds would be carried out
largely through periodic advances to the Special Account based on PMRs. These reports link eligible expenditures
with actual physical progress made under the project. The PMU has all of the necessary computer software already
installed and sample reports, compatible with IDA's PRM-based disbursement system guidelines. A time-bound
Action Plan (included in the Project File) for PRM-based disbursement system will be implemented within one year

Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project          Page 8                         Project Appraisal Document
of Credit effectiveness has been agreed with the GOY. The PMU is not expected to have more than 10 contracts
under implementation at any one time and, therefore, it is reasonably sure that it can execute the PRM-based
disbursement system without difficulty. The Resident Mission in Sana'a is also staffed with personnel trained in
PRM-based disbursement system procedures and is ready to assist the PMU as necessary.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangemnents: During negotiations, IDA agreed with the GOY on the design of interim
monitoring indicators to be used to mark progress towards preparation of the concession, affermage or management
contract. These indicators are accompanied by a dated action program. The indicators are in the Project File
attached to the minutes of Negotiations.
The PMU would be responsible for monitoring overall Project progress against agreed performance indicators
specified in Annex 1. The PMU will submit quarterly reports summarizing the utilization of project funds for IDA
review. The standardized format for the reports would be finalized during the Project Launch Workshop. They
would cover implementation status; deviations, if any, from the Implementation Plan; problems and constraints and
corrective actions being taken; and updated disbursement and commitment tables. The PMU would prepare a
detailed midtern report to serve as the basis for a Project Mid-Term Review (scheduled for February 2001). The
PMU will also prepare and submit an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to IDA within six months of the
Closing Date of the Credit.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives conlsidlered and r easons for rejection: Section A.3 contains a complete discussion of the
various project alternatives considered by IDA and the rationale for the selected strategy. More generally for the
sector, IDA's investment strategy now emphasizes projects continuing with the few components and that will
produce results in less than four years. For example, a larger project for Sana'a was originally considered with more
components and a six-year implementation period. However, past experience has shown that there are often delays
and the need for Closing Date extensions with this traditional approach. In addition, the timely availability of
counterpart funds has also been a problem, and it is considered better to limit the amounts that would be needed in
any one year by reducing the overall project size. IDA also considered an Adaptable Program Lending approach for
the sector. However, given the embryonic stage of sector reform, it was considered better to first undertake a
traditional investment credit that would prepare the institutional framework for a later APL. Finally, the project
scope, especially for civil works, was intentionally limited and front-loaded in the implementation period so that they
would be completed well before the expected Closing Date, and in order to bring relief to the project beneficiaries as
soon as possible.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in thte project design.
The initial difficulties experienced with the IDA-financed Al-Mukalla, Tarim and Taiz Water Supply Projects has
highlighted the need for a major change in the sector's organization and management, as well as in IDA's approach.
Thus, the Sana'a Project design has integrated the following features:
* a comprehensive sector strategy as a starting point;
* a realistic financial strategy, which calls for positive cash flow as a priority;
* addressing sectoral issues on a branch-by-branch basis and not at the national level;
* a local, capable and adequately financed PMU;
* a simple and straightforward design, with a few focused components and a limited implementation period; and

installation of a management contract, concession or affermage for the Sana'a Branch, which can then be used as
a model for other cities.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
* The Government prepared, and the Cabinet endorsed, a comprehensive sector reform policy;
* The GOY has shown a willingness to adopt private sector participation for the energy sector and has committed
to apply it in the urban water sector on, or before, the Project Closing Date;
* The Government requested and has spent most of a US$2.0 million PPF to: (i) prepare three civil works
packages, totaling some US$1 1.0 million (or about 38 percent of the total project), that have been awarded and
now await Credit effectiveness for mobilization, and (ii) establish the PMU;
* The GOY has repeatedly raised tariffs to better reflect costs; and
* Concerned residents of the areas where the project civil works will be completed have actively lobbied their
representatives in Parliament to support and speed up the Project.
5. Value added of IDA support in thiis project:
IDA has over 20 years of involvement in the water and sanitation sector in Yemen and, therefore, is in an
advantageous position to argue for, and assist in the preparation of, meaningful sector reform and reaching financial
soundness. Its involvement in public expenditure reviews across the Middle East has also allowed it to assist the
GOY in determining the proper priority for water and wastewater investments within a constrained budget envelope.
This experience has strengthened the case for putting the Sana'a Project, with its important sector reforms and
financial conditions, on a fast track inside the overall investment plan. In addition, IDA has a varied and active
portfolio of water and wastewater projects in the Middle East and North Africa, dealing with a wide range of
resource constraints and institutional models. It also has a Yemen Water Team that is adopting a comprehensive and
integrated approach to water resource planning and investment, from both the urban-rural and basin perspectives.
The Yemeni Government values this experience and has often requested advice from IDA on a wide range of
relevant issues. It has also asked for assistance in arranging study tours and contacts to evaluate the experience of its
Arab neighbors with various forms of private sector provision of water and wastewater services. IDA's regional
experience also brought value-added to the Project's design (e.g., an emphasis on sector reform, and the need to
devote considerable resources to the search for new water resources for the city). Finally, the proximity of the IDA
Sana'a Resident Mission will greatly assist in the Project's implementation.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments of selected topics below are in the project file, see Annex
10 for a complete listing)
1. Economnic (supported by Annex 4):
Overview. Methodology. The economic analysis looks at the Hasabah water network rehabilitation, the Akama
sewer network installation, and the Sabeen bulk water components of the project separately. It employs a cost
benefit analysis for each, using a 15 year analysis period and a 10 percent discount rate (IDA's normal hurdle rate
for water and wastewater projects). The analysis, using a with and without project methodology, estimates financial
and economic net present values, as well as financial and economic internal rates of return. Sensitivity and
Switching Values. Each analysis models risks identified in Section F of the PAD. There is also a sensitivity
analysis of the effect of cost overruns and project delays as well as items considered by the Task Team to have a
large effect on the Base Case ERR. Each analysis calculates switching values for these items. Taxes. Contractors
working on IDA contracts in Yemen are normally exempt from income taxes. Local taxes and duties are included in
the price of inputs purchased locally (e.g., cement, plastic or fiberglass pipes, etc.). However, given that most of
these items are not available locally in the quantities required, contractors will likely import these materials.
Imported items will be duty free. Taxes on items procured locally for the project will amount to very small amounts
and, therefore, are not separately estimated.

Summary of Results. Results of the Base Case analyses are shown below. Estimated economic returns are all
acceptable, varying from 20 to 33 percent. Financial results are also acceptable, acknowledging that a significant
cross-subsidy is taking place within the utility to support the emergency sewer system installation for the Akama
area. In all analyses, financial flows are converted to economic flows by estimating the effects of the shadow
exchange rate. In addition, for the Akama analysis, the increase in property values is also estimated. All Base Case
economic analysis scenarios are based on the Base Case financial model described in Annex 5, which shows that the
Sana'a Branch will cover O&M costs in 1999 and thereafter.

The financial analysis highlights an important policy issue for the future of sewer installations in the city. In the
Akama case, the investment cost per connection is about 25 times the connection charge ($880 and $35,
respectively). This fee regime is not sustainable, and only made possible in the Akama case through the projected
high tariff increases for the whole utility and the small area addressed with this Project. In effect, the rest of the city
is subsidizing the installation of the sewer network in Akama, yet virtually all the immediate benefits are captured by
Akama residents only. In the future, NWSA should insure a more equitable, sustainable and systematic sharing of
the benefits of sewer projects through much higher connection fees.
Hasabah Water Network Rehabilitation. The Base Case scenario for this component makes two main assumptions.
First, with the low amounts of water consumed from the NWSA network in the Hasabah area, the revenue generated
per cubic meter sold is an important consideration. Therefore, it is assumed that the tariff increases in the Financial
Model Base case will take place as stated there, and that the percent increase in tariffs will be the same. However,
the effect of this assumption of the analysis is subjected to a sensitivity analysis described below.
The second principal assumption is that consumption in the Hasabah area is around 50 I/c/d, made up of a
combination of NWSA-supplied and tanker-supplied water. Studies conducted during Project preparation show that
NWSA can be assumed to supply about half of this amount and private vendors the remainder. As the project is
completed over the period 1999 to 2002, the amount purchased from tankers is replaced with the lower cost NWSA-
supplied water. At the same time, the total amount of water consumed in the household will increase, reflecting
changes in the household water budget brought about by substituting lower cost NWSA water for higher cost tanker
water.
Results of the sensitivity analysis and switching values for the Hasabah component are as follows:

3     Construction costs would have to increase by how much to      51%

Akama Sewer Network Installation. In the economic analysis for this component, there are assumptions made about:
(i) the cost and frequency of cesspit emptying and construction; (ii) avoided health care costs per capita; and (iii) the
avoided costs of insuring clean water. Each assumption is based on the survey work and in most cases the values
used are more conservative than those cited (see Appendix 2 for details). Individual changes in these assumptions
have only a modest effect on the EIRR. For example, decreasing the frequency of emptying cesspits, from over once
per month to one per year, lowers the EIRR by about 5 percent. Reducing the avoided health care costs per capita by
75% also lowers the EIRR by only 5 percent.
The other major assumption for the Base Case is the degree to which property values will increase. Field work
during project preparation documented that rents and the cost per square meter of undeveloped land in Sana'a will
increase with the installation of a pipe borne sewage system. Estimates varied from 10 to 100 percent, based on
professional estimates and observed increases in recently sewered areas of the city. For the base case economic
analysis of this component, a five percent increase in property value is assumed, a figure one-half the lowest increase
cited. However, the effects of this assumption on the economic internal rate of return is subjected to sensitivity and
switching value analysis.

Sabeen Bulk Water Component. For this component, two major assumptions are made. First, the six production
boreholes are assumed to yield about 80 lps in total (an average of 13 lps each). This is a reasonable assumption
based on the fact that an existing borehole in the area has yielded 15 lps for the last three years, with no static draw
down. However, there is always a risk with well drilling that yields will be substantially less than expected. Thus,
this assumption is subjected to a sensitivity analysis as described below.



Yemen
Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project        Page 13                       Project Appraisal Document
The second major assumption is that 25% of the water from the Sabeen well field will replace vendor water currently
being purchased by consumers. This assumption is based on field observations that about half of all water consumed
in Sana'a comes from more expensive private suppliers and that many areas of the city have water in the public
network only once or twice per week. This assumption is also examined in the sensitivity analysis below.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values are summarized in the following two tables:

Implications for IDA Supervision Missions. Several items highlighted in the discussion above are key in achieving
the Base Case EIRRs. Some of these will be monitored via compliance with covenants in the Development Credit
Agreement (e.g., the financial targets), but others will need to be monitored during supervision. Therefore, IDA's
supervision missions should monitor at least the following:
1. Construction cost overruns;
2. Degree to which all consumers connect to the Akama sewer system;
3. Changes in vendor water purchased after the Hasabah civil works are completed;
4. Changes in total water consumed per capita in Hasabah;
5. Amount of water produced by the Sabeen wellfield;
6. Decrease in per capita avoided health costs in the Akama area;
7. Changes in property and rental values in Akama; and
8. Changes in sewer connection fees
Some of the monitoring work can be done in connection with the follow-up household surveys for Akama and
Hasabah, included in the "Public Consultation" line of the Environmental Management Plan. Other items can be
included in the Tariff Study and Public Awareness part of the Project's Supervision and Monitoring component. The
remaining items will have to be separately monitored (e.g., Nos. 1, 5 and 7) and should be included in the TOR for
IDA supervision missions.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
As a condition of appraisal, IDA required that the Sana'a Branch be able to cover its O&M costs on a cash basis for
1999. For the year 2001, IDA has also stipulated that the Branch generate enough cash to cover O&M, debt service

and 5 percent of the next year's investment program. To achieve the 1999 target, the Branch most recently raised
tariffs in January 1999, and plans another tariff adjustment and/or other measures during the fall of 1999. The Base
Case financial model, presented in Annex 5, illustrates that it is possible for the Sana'a Branch to meet all of IDA's
financial requirements with annual, but achievable, tariff increases starting in 1999. Financial results of the Base
Case are summarized below.

Financial Plan. At negotiations, the Government provided assurance to IDA that the Sana'a Branch would submit to
IDA, not later than June 30 of each year, its annual investment program for the succeeding year, together with its
financial plan and the tariff increase required to meet its investment and financial performance.
Financial Management System-PMU. The Project PMU was established in September 1997 by NWSA to facilitate
the implementation of the proposed project. The PMU reports to the Sana'a Executive Board and is responsible for
receipts and disbursement of the Project's funds as well as in the accounting for the proper use of these funds, in
accordance with the international accounting standards. It has installed its own computerized accounting, financial
and management information systems and has recruited a Financial Manager, who is currently on a part-time
assignment, until the Credit for the proposed project is declared effective. The organizational structure of the PMU
addresses the reporting level of the Finance Manager, internal control and audit and the need to furnish financial
information on the project's physical progress and related costs, to its management and lenders. Financial
management arrangements for the project are detailed in Annex 6 and are summarize below.
A Manual of Procedures (MOP), which documents the operation of the project's financial management system, has
been prepared in draft form. The draft MOP is still incomplete in terms of the computerized interface of the financial
with the technical operations, as well as in the description of work flow between the technical and financial areas. A
good computerized system with the facility for generating several financial reports will be developed. Key actions
which are in process, and which need to be completed, are (i) completion of the financial management system,



Yemen
Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project        Page 15                       Project Appraisal Document
including finalization and adoption of MOP, and computerization of the FMS to adopt the PMR-based disbursement
system. This is expected to be completed by December 31, 1999; (ii) appointment of a firm of private auditors
acceptable to IDA for the project. This is expected to be completed by September 1, 1999; and (iii) appointment of
Finance Manager to full-time assignment at the PMU by June 1, 1999. Disbursements from the IDA Credit would
initially be made on the traditional system (reimbursements with full documentation and against Statements of
Expenditure - SOEs, and direct payments) and would be converted to the new procedures (i.e., based on Project
Management Reports - PMRs) after the FMS is operating satisfactory. The target date for this conversion is March
31, 2000.
Financial Management System-NWSA Sana'a Branch. There is an overlap in the accounting, financial, computer,
planning and budgeting systems between the Sana'a Branch and NWSA Headquarters. The Branch enters the daily
transactions in its books and monthly provides data on revenues and operating expenses to NWSA Headquarters,
where the financial statements (income statement and balance sheet) are prepared and consolidated with all other
branches. There is no reconciliation of accounts between the Branch and the Headquarters. Cost accounting, which
is an integral part of financial accounting system and vital to tariff setting, does not exist. In order for the Branch's
financial system to operate in a transparent manner and to develop a management tool for decision making, TA will
be provided under the proposed project to: (i) clarify the separation of accounting responsibilities between the Sana'a
Branch and NWSA Headquarters: (ii) set up a cost accounting system for the Branch; (iii) design an automatic cost
adjustment tariff setting mechanism; and (iv) design computerized financial and management reports. A detailed
assessment of the Sana'a Branch's financial management system is included in the Project Files.
Fiscal Impact. The GOY has agreed to pass the proceeds of the Credit to the Sana'a Branch as a grant contribution
to equity. Thus, there will be fiscal impact from the counterpart requirement, plus the repayment of principal and
debt service. There is also a fiscal impact of the shadow exchange rate on the local portion of the civil works and the
environmental mitigation costs. The Project's fiscal impact is summarized in the following table.
Summary of the Project's Fiscal Impact
(YR 000)
Total
Fiscal Impact Source         Project
Forex Premium                  52,264
Principal                    3,500,000
* Commitment Fee + Interest    689,763
Counterpart Requirement       420,000
Total                        4,662,027
* The Commitment Fee may be waived by IDA's Board of Directors.
The Project's $25 million principal amount represents a 0.75 percent increase in the country's total debt outstanding
and disbursed. The average annual debt service over 40 years (principal repayment, commitment fee and interest) is
estimated at $748,000 and will add just under I percent to Yemen's current $84 million of debt service per year.
Total fiscal impact would average $832,000 per year over 40 years, which is not considered to impose any fiscal
burden as it represents about a quarter of one percent of the country's estimated 1997 GNP. These estimates are
based on the SDR exchange rate of 1.3587 US$ = I SDR which may change over the life of the project.
Coordination With Public Expenditure Review. This Project is specifically mentioned in the country's investment
budget and latest Public Expenditure Review. It represents about 13 percent of the $185 million "A" project
investment plan for NWSA for the coming five years. "A" projects are those given the highest funding priority in
the IDA/GOY Public Expenditure Review, most recently completed in November 1998. (The Task Team considers
that only "A" projects are likely to be implemented over the period 1999-2004, because of prevailing fiscal
constraints.)

3. Technical:
The Project uses conventional engineering designs and specifications for each of the civil works contracts and calls
for the use of standard electromechanical equipment to replace worn out items at the existing and new boreholes.
The water network and wastewater components of the project consist of laying concrete, ductile iron or UPVC pipes
and the installation of concrete manholes. There are no pumps to be installed. The approximately 6,000 water meters
to be used in the Hasabah area will be of standard designs. All design engineering work was done by a large,
experienced international consulting engineering firm, which was awarded its contract using IDA's Quality and Cost
Based Selection (QCBS) procedures. Before the civil works contracts were tendered in mid- 1998, IDA reviewed all
of the technical drawings, plus the bid and tender documents, and found them satisfactory. With the relatively
simple civil works anticipated under this Project, there are no substantial technical issues. The choice of wastewater
technology, i.e., a pipe borne sewage system conveying to a wastewater treatment plant, is the preferred choice with
the government and the residents of the Akama area. Technical approaches for the water network rehabilitation are
limited considering the GOY's intention to provide 80 I/c/d for all piped water areas in the city. The issues for the
water network rehabilitation are also minor; such as the depth of trenches, house connection pipe diameter or the
choice of pipe material for primary and secondary lines.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agency: The executing agency is the Sana'a Branch, through its Executive Board, on behalf of the
GOY. Personnel in the Sana'a Branch have ample operational experience and adequate project implementation
capacity. Therefore, for the day-to day management of the Project, a small PMU has been established that reports to
the Executive Board. NWSA will serve as a technical resource and its personnel are available to assist the PMU and
Executive Board as needed.
b. Project management: The PMU was established in September 1997 and is headed by an experienced engineer that
was competitively hired after being interviewed and cleared by IDA. The PMU has a full-time secretary and a part-
time accountant, and it may hire another full-time engineer if the work load so warrants. As soon as the Project is
effective, a part-time Safety and Environment Officer will be recruited, as well as a Information Management
Specialist. The PMU has its own office space and adequate office equipment to oversee and document project
implementation. The PMU Director reports to the newly established Sana'a Branch Executive Board, of which the
Minister of Electricity and Water is the Chairman. The Director General of NWSA and the Mayor of Sana'a are
Vice-Chairmen. This reporting mechanism should help the PMU to implement the Project quickly, principally by
assisting it to overcome the bureaucratic bottlenecks typically experienced by previous IDA projects.
5. Social.
During Project preparation, two household surveys were carried out in the city and included areas to be affected by
the planned civil works. There has also been an extensive public consultation process including neighborhood
meetings, newspaper articles and a television program devoted to the Project (see Section 7 below, Annex 9 and the
Environmental Impact Assessment in the Project File for details). The Project is not expected to have any adverse
social impacts. It does not involve resettlement of any kind, there are no indigenous people affected by the project
and there are no cultural heritage sites in the project area. All of the construction takes place in established rights of
way, in built up and formal sections of the city. The project will have a significant positive social impact in the
Akama neighborhood through an improvement in sanitary conditions and an increase in property values. The
Project will also have a positive social impact through an increase in the quantity of potable water available in
Hasabah's water network, and by saving households money through a reduction in the amount of water bought from
tankers. The environmental benefits brought about by the Project in the Akama area are expected to benefit women,
and especially children, through decreased health risks.
6. Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category     []A   [X] B  []C
There are no known major environmental issues in the project. There is no resettlement, nor are there any indigenous



Yemen
Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project          Page 17                        Project Appraisal Document
people or cultural heritage issues. The project does not affect any international waterways. The project does not
involve any relocation of buildings, and all construction is in built up areas of the city with pre-existing utility rights
of ways. Overall, the project will substantially improve environmental conditions by removing sewer cesspits,
increasing the number of sewer connections and increasing the supply of piped water. The city already has a
wastewater treatment plant, and a new, larger treatment plant is under construction with Arab and OPEC Fund
support. The additional sewers connected to the new plant under the proposed project will not exceed the new
plant's treatment capacity.
The project does present two environmental considerations for which mitigation plans have been formulated. First,
and for the first four months of construction only, the disposal of wastewater and solids from closed cesspits in the
Akama area will present a problem as the existing sewage treatment plant is over charged during most of its
operating hours. The government's mitigation plan is only dump cesspit waste at off peak hours and to monitor the
operation of the plant to insure that its operations do not worsen as a result. After the new treatment plant is
operational in December 1999, this issue will become moot.
The second issue has to do with the disposal of dried wastewater sludge from the new treatment plant. During
project implementation, the new treatment plant is expected to produce about 32 tons of sludge per day with a 30
percent moisture content. The wastewater treatment site has dried sludge storage capacity for about 15 months.
During this period the GOY must determine a sludge re-use policy and designate a final disposal method for the
sludge. The project contains about $100,000 to assist the GOY in formulating the policy, which will likely involve a
combination of selling it to interested farmers and safe disposal in an appropriate landfill.
A description of secondary environmental issues, and an outline of the project's mitigation plan, are included in
Annex 9. The complete Environmental Impact Assessment, prepared by the GOY with the assistance of
international consultants, is included in the Project File.
7. Participatowy approach.:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Under the Project, the primary beneficiaries are those households and small businesses living in areas where water
and wastewater service will be improved. For the Sana'a project, approximately 50,000 people will be added to the
piped sewer network, and another 45,000 people will have their potable water service improved. Another 12,000
household connections will be replaced and approximately $350,000 has been allocated for emergency sewer works
in areas to be defined during Project implementation.
The GOY has undertaken an extensive public awareness campaign concerning the project (see details in Annex 9
and in the Environmental Impact Assessment which is part of the Project File). Public Awareness has included
public meetings in the project areas, briefing with Members of Parliament representing the project areas, newspaper
articles, and one television program. NWSA and IDA have also undertaken two household surveys as part of project
preparation activities. As a result of these consultations, strong support for the project has been expressed, and the
choice of sewer technology endorsed. The stakeholders participating in the meetings have also had an effect on the
speed of project preparation, with the result that the initial sewer civil works contracts are ready for mobilization well
before the Project will be effective.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Other key stakeholders are those affected by the sector reforms included under the Project. These groups include
NWSA and the Technical Secretariat, some parties in the MEW, and donors active in the water sector. Among these
groups, there is already extensive consultation and collaboration on water sector issues and this is expected to
continue over the long-term. In this context, stakeholder influence over Project design was considerable. For
example, the sector policy components were discussed over several months among the Technical Secretariat, the
MEW and donors, and there is now, for all practical purposes, complete agreement among all parties on these items.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
This Project has substantial risks. The first risk is that the autonomy of the Sana'a Branch during this Project,
considered essential for improving its efficiency, would be compromised despite the creation of the independent
reporting mechanism of the Sana'a Executive Board. In this case, operational improvements would proceed slower
than expected, with consequent delays in meeting the Project's financial and operational targets.
An additional risk is that the GOY may decide that it cannot, for political or other reasons, implement the award of a
private sector operation and management contract, concession or affermage for the Sana'a Branch within the agreed
timeframe of the Project. In this case, IDA would be left with the first strategic option described above in Section
B.3.-i.e., not investing any further in the sector.

Risk Rating - H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), N (Negligible or Low Risk)
3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The inviting of a private sector operator or joint venture partner, to take over operation of Sana'a Branch. This will
very likely lead to a reduction in the Sana'a Branch work force, and the issue could become politicized.
G: Main Loan Conditions
1. Effectiveness Conditions:
The execution of the Subsidiary Grant Agreement.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
Overview. Methodology. The economic analysis looks at the Hasabah water network rehabilitation, the Akama
sewer network installation, and the Sabeen bulk water components of the project separately. It employs a cost
benefit analysis for each, using a 15 year analysis period and a 10 percent discount rate (IDA's normal hurdle rate
for water and wastewater projects). The analysis, using a with and without project methodology, estimates financial
and economic net present values, as well as financial and economic internal rates of return. Sensitivity and
Switching Values. Each analysis models risks identified in Section F of the PAD. There is a sensitivity analysis of
the effect of cost overruns and project delays as well as items considered by the Task Team to have a large effect on
the Base Case ERR. Each analysis also calculates switching values for these items. Taxes. Contractors working on
IDA contracts in Yemen are normally exempt from income taxes. Local taxes and duties are included in the price of
inputs purchased locally (e.g., cement, plastic or fiberglass pipes, etc.). However, given that most of these items are
not available locally in the quantities required, contractors will likely import these materials. Imported items will be
duty free. Taxes on items procured locally for the project will amount to very small amounts and, therefore, are not
separately estimated.
Summary of Results. Results of the Base Case analyses are shown in Table A4.1. Economic returns are all
acceptable, varying from 20 to 23 percent. Financial results are also acceptable, if one acknowledges that a
significant cross-subsidy is taking place within the utility to support the emergency sewer system installation for the
Akama area. In all analyses, financial flows are converted to economic flows by estimating the effects of the shadow
exchange rate. In addition, for the Akamak analysis, the increase in property values is also estimated. All Base
Case economic analysis scenarios are based on the Base Case financial model described in Annex 5, which shows
that the Sana'a Branch will cover O&M costs in 1999 and thereafter.

Regarding the Akama financial results, customers in this neighborhood have expressed a strong preference through
household surveys and public consultation events for a piped sewer network, even though less expensive solutions
may have also been appropriate. This choice of investment to quickly address the emergency nature of the Akama
situation, is also supported by the GOY and consistent with its desire to have built-up areas of the capital served only
by a piped sewer system. However, this expressed preference and policy decision requires higher income areas of
the city to cross-subsidize the Akama sewer system to a substantial degree (demonstrated by the negative FIRR in
the economic analysis, but a positive cash flow in the financial model described in Annex 5). Finally, as a
comparison of the financial and economic analyses reveals, households in the Akama area will experience a very
rapid and substantial increase in property values once the sewer system is installed-perhaps thereby validating their
preferred choice of investment.
The financial analysis highlights an important policy issue for the future of sewer installations in the city. In the
Akama case, the investment cost per connection is about 25 times the connection charge ($880 and $35,
respectively). This fee regime is not sustainable, and only made possible in the Akama case through the projected

high tariff increases for the whole utility and the small area addressed with this Project. In effect, the rest of the city
is subsidizing the installation of the sewer network in Akama, yet virtually all the benefits are captured by Akama
residents only. In the future, NWSA should insure a more equitable, sustainable and systematic sharing of the
benefits of sewer projects through much higher connection fees.
Fiscal Impact. The GOY has agreed to pass the proceeds of the Credit to the Sana'a Branch as a grant contribution
to equity. Thus, there will be fiscal impact from the counterpart requirement, plus the repayment of principal and
debt service. There is also a fiscal impact of the shadow exchange rate on the local portion of the civil works and the
environmental mitigation costs. The Project's fiscal impact is summarized in Table A4.2.

* The Commitment Fee may be waived by IDA's Board of Directors.
It is expected that the Credit will be repaid over 40 years with a ten year grace period. The interest rate is 0.75
percent on the disbursed balance, and a commitment fee of 0.50 may be charged on the undisbursed balance. The
Project's $25 million principal amount represents a 0.75 percent increase in the country's total debt outstanding and
disbursed. The average annual debt service over 40 years (principal repayment, commitment fee and interest) is
estimated at $748,00 and will add just over I percent to Yemen's current $84 million of debt service per year. Total
fiscal impact would average $832,000 per year over 40 years, which is not considered to impose any fiscal burden as
it represents less than one quarter of one percent of the country's estimated 1997 GNP.
Coordination With Public Expenditure Review. This Project is specifically mentioned in the country's investment
budget. It represents about 13 percent of the $185 million "A" project investment plan for NWSA for the coming
five years. "A" projects are those given the highest funding priority in the IDA/GOY Public Expenditure Review,
most recently completed in November 1998. (The Task Team considers that only "A" projects are likely to be
implemented over the period 1999-2004, because of prevailing fiscal constraints.)
Hasabah Water Network Rehabilitation. This component of the Project comprises the rehabilitation or replacement
of large portions of the water network in the Hasabah area of Sana'a. Hasabah is about 325 hectares located in
northwest Sana'a and has a population of approximately 20,000 people in 1999. The population is expected to reach
about 65,000 people by the year 2005 and then remain constant. The project envisages about 27 kilometers of pipe
to be replaced, including portions of the primary, secondary and tertiary network. Some 20,000 house connections
will be added in the area during the analysis period and about 6,000 existing house connections and meters will be
replaced.
Project benefits result from the connection of additional households to the water system which is made possible by
the larger and rehabilitated network, the reduction in UFW, and by substituting NWSA-provided water for a part of
the water currently purchased from tankers (lowering overall financial outlays for water and permitting an increase in
the total l/c/d consumed) The increase in NWSA supplied water results from a combination of reducing UFW,
construction of the Sabeen wellfield and the rehabilitation of existing wellfields and boreholes. Financial flows are
converted to economic flows by estimating the shadow exchange rate applied to locally acquired inputs for the
relevant civil works and costs of the environmental mitigation program.

Assumptions. In the analysis for the Hasabah component of the Project, there are two main assumptions. First, with
the low amounts of water consumed from the NWSA network in the Hasabah area, the revenue generated per cubic
meter sold is an important consideration. Therefore, it is assumed that the tariff increases in the Financial Model
Base case will take place as stated there, and that the percent increase in tariffs will be the same. However, the effect
of this assumption of the analysis is subjected to a sensitivity analysis described below.
The second principal assumption is that consumption in the Hasabah area is around 50 I/c/d, made up of a
combination of NWSA-supplied and tanker-supplied water (see Hasabah Feasibility Study pg. 5.5, October 1998 and
B6sch Report, pg. 35). Studies conducted during Project preparation show that NWSA can be assumed to supply
about half of this amount and private vendors the remainder (see draft Development Programme, October 1998, pg.
3.17). As the project is completed over the period 1999 to 2002, the amount purchased from tankers is replaced with
the lower cost NWSA-supplied water. The amounts replaced decrease from about 16 I/c/d in 1999 to about 9 I/c/d by
2004. At the same time, the total amount of water consumed in the household will increase, reflecting changes in the
household water budget brought about by substituting lower cost NWSA water for higher cost tanker water. The
Base Case model assumes that total water consumption goes up by about 2 percent per year for four years, going
from 50 to 54 I/c/d, and remaining stable after that. The cost of water from NWSA is priced at the lowest block of
1998 tariff. The price of water from tankers is estimated at YR300/m3, which is slightly below the average of prices
observed in the two household surveys done during project preparation (see Bosch Report, pg. 45 and Development
Programme, Appendix J, pg. 3.3) The effect of these assumed amounts is also subjected to a sensitivity analysis
described below.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values. In the sensitivity analysis, four scenarios are modeled, including two
risks identified in Section F.2. of the PAD. Two critical assumptions are also modeled for their switching values.
Results are show in Table A4.3 and A4.4.

Results of the economic analysis for the Hasabah water network rehabilitation, highlight three important issues for
the Project (especially concerning the financial flows):
1. There is a substantial cross-subsidy in the tariff, so it is critical that the foreseen tariff increases take place;

2. There has to be enough water in the public network to offset purchases from private vendors, so the
completion of the Borehole Rehabilitation and Sabeen wellfield components is very important; and
3. Construction costs should not be permitted to exceed the forecast amounts.
Akama Sewer Network Installation. The Akama area has a population of about 35,000 people and is situated on
about 145 hectares in the west part of Sana'a City. The population is expected to increase to about 48,000 by 2005
and thereafter remain constant. This component of the project involves connecting every household in the area to a
new sewer network (about 5,000 customers by 2001, rising to about 7,000 customers by 2005). It also includes the
construction of a 5.2 kilometer long sewer truck main to carry Akama sewage to the existing, and then the new,
wastewater treatment plants. Currently, all wastewater disposal in the area is done to cesspits.
Project financial benefits accrue from: (i) sewer connection fees; (ii) monthly charges for wastewater service; (iii)
foregoing of cesspit maintenance and the construction of new cesspits; (iv) avoided household health care costs; and
(v) avoided costs to insure clean water. Financial flows are converted to economic flows by: (i) estimating the
increase in property values resulting from being connected to a sewer system; and (ii) the effects of the shadow
exchange rate on locally purchased inputs to the civil works and environmental management plan.
The financial net present value for this component is negative, reflecting: (i) the high investment cost of this
wastewater disposal method; (ii) high wastewater treatment costs at the new treatment plant; and (iii) low water
consumption (implying low sewer charges). Despite its high cost, household surveys and public consultations have
confirmed that it is the preferred technology. Most likely this is because interviews undertaken with local realtors
documented the very rapid and substantial increase in rents and property values that take place after a sewer system
is installed (see Bosche report, pp. 59-60). The GOY also has made a policy decision that all built-up areas of the
country's capital city should be served by a piped sewer network.
In the economic model for this component, the average household consumes just over the lifeline amount of water
per month (10 m3), resulting in low sewer revenues. As a result, costs per m3 treated at the new treatment plant
exceed the average sewer bill in the Akama area for every year of the analysis. This is possible for the Sana'a
Branch to tolerate for two reasons: (i) there is a substantial cross-subsidy in the sewer tariff; and (ii) the Akama area
represents less than 10 percent of all Sana'a Branch customers. These two factors make it possible for the Sana'a
Branch overall to meet its O&M costs and still provide the Akama area this wastewater option.
Assumptions. In the economic analysis for this component, there are assumptions made about: (i) the cost and
frequency of cesspit emptying and construction; (ii) avoided health care costs per capita; and (iii) the avoided costs
of ensuring clean water. Each assumption is based on the survey work and in most cases the values used are more
conservative than those cited (see Appendix 2 for details). Individual changes in these assumptions have only a
modest effect on the EIRR. For example, decreasing the frequency of emptying cesspits, from over once per month
to one per year, lowers the EIRR by about 5 percent. Reducing the avoided health care costs per capita by 75% also
lowers the EIRR by only 5 percent.
The other major assumption for the Base Case is the degree to which property values will increase. Field work
during project preparation documented that rents and the cost per square meter of undeveloped land in Sana'a will
increase with the installation of a pipe borne sewage system. Estimates varied from 10 to 100 percent, based on
professional estimates and observed increases in recently sewered areas of the city. For the base case economic
analysis of this component, a five percent increase in property value is assumed, a figure one-half the lowest increase
cited. However, the effects of this assumption on the economic internal rate of return is tested below.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values. In the sensitivity analysis, only two scenarios are modeled (reflecting
that majority of the benefits flow from the increase in property values). The property value increase assumption is
also modeled for its switching value. Results are show in Table A4.5 and A4.6.

Important issues for Project implementation for this component, resulting from the economic analysis, are as follows
(especially concerning the financial flows):
1. There is a substantial cross-subsidy in the tariff, so it is critical that the foreseen tariff increases take place;
2. The projected increase in property values assumes that all households connect to the new sewer system. If
raw sewage is still present in Akama after the Project is completed, property values are not expected to
increase as much as in the Base Case; and
3. Construction costs should not be permitted to exceed the forecast amounts.
Sabeen Bulk Water Component. This component involves the drilling of one exploratory borehole and then up to six
production boreholes in the Sabeen area of Sana'a (between the Ring and 45 Meter Roads in the southern part of the
city). The exploratory well is expected to reach around 1,000 meters in depth and the production wells are expected
to range in depth from 500 to 700 meters. This component also includes the relevant equipment for the boreholes
(pumps, cabling, electrical service, etc.) plus a 400 m3 reservoir.
Benefits for this component flow from: (i) the expected yield of water, estimated to be about 80 liters per second
(Ips), which is then sold through the NWSA network; and (ii) a reduction in water bought from vendors. Financial
flows are converted to economic flows by modeling the effect of the shadow exchange rate on the local portion of
civil works.
Assumptions. For the analysis, two major assumptions are made. First, the six production boreholes are assumed to
yield about 80 lps in total (an average of 13 lps each). This is a reasonable assumption based on the fact that an
existing borehole in the area has yielded 15 lps for the last three years, with no static draw down. However, there is
always a risk with well drilling that yields will be substantially less than expected. Thus, this assumption is
subjected to a sensitivity analysis as described below.
The second major assumption is that 25% of the water from the Sabeen well field will replace vendor water currently
being purchased by consumers. This is assumption is considered realistic seeing that that about half of all water
consumed in Sana'a comes from more expensive private suppliers and that many areas of the city have water in the
public network only once or twice per week. This assumption is also examined in the sensitivity analysis below.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values. In the sensitivity analysis, three scenarios are modeled, all reflecting
risks as outlined in Section F.2, of the PAD. For the switching value analysis, the two of the most sensitive
variables in the model are examined. Results are show in Tables A4.7 and A4.8.

to result in an ENPV=O? (Base Case = 25%)                            l
Important issues for Project implementation for this component, resulting from the economic analysis, are as follows:
*  The projected tariff increases take place as scheduled; and
*  The Sabeen wellfield needs to yield about 80 Ips-no matter how many boreholes are required. In addition,
this yield is needed by the Closing Date (to isolate this component from the risks of the sector reform
agenda).
Implications for IDA Supervision Missions. Several items highlighted in the discussion above are key in achieving
the Base Case EIRRs. Some of these will be monitored via compliance with covenants in the Development Credit
Agreement (e.g., the financial targets), but others will need to be monitored during supervision. Therefore, IDA's
supervision missions should monitor at least the following:
1. Construction cost overruns;
2. Degree to which all consumers connect to the Akama sewer system;
3. Changes in vendor water purchased after the Hasabah civil works are completed;
4. Changes in total water consumed per capita in Hasabah;
5. Amount of water produced by the Sabeen wellfield;
6. Decrease in per capita avoided health costs in the Akama area;
7. Changes in property and rental values in Akama; and
8. Changes in sewer connection fees
Some of the monitoring work can be done in connection with the follow-up household surveys for Akama and
Hasabah, included in the "Public Consultation" line of the Environmental Management Plan. Other items can be
included in the Tariff Study and Public Awareness part of the Project's Supervision and Monitoring component. The
remaining items will have to be separately monitored (e.g., Nos. 1, 5 and 7) and should be included in the TOR for
IDA supervision missions.

ANNEX 5
Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation
Financial Summary
Overview: IDA has insisted that the Sana'a Branch cover its O&M costs on a cash basis, on average, for 1999.
For the year 2001, IDA has also stipulated that the Branch generate enough cash to cover O&M, debt service and
5 percent of the next year's investment program. To achieve the 1999 target, the Branch raised tariffs in
December 1998, and plans another tariff adjustment and/or other measures during late 1999. It was agreed during
negotiations that the GOY would decide on the exact measures necessary to meet the 1999 target not later than
June 1999.
The Base Case presented in this Annex as Appendix I makes the assumptions described below and illustrates that it
is possible for the Branch to meet IDA's financial requirements to the year 2004 with regular, but manageable annual
tariff increases. As shown in the summarized table below, Base Case income, before non-cash items and debt
service, ranges from YR201 million ($1.4 million) in 1999, to YR579 million ($4.1 million) in 2004.

Assumptions. Base Case financial projections are estimated on the most recent financial informationl obtained
from the Sana'a Branch. The financial model is expressed in current terms, using 1998 as the base year, with
costs calculated in early 1999, and is based on the following assumptions for local and international inflation:
Table A5.2 Inflation Rates
Inflation       1998     1999     2000      2001  l  2002  l 2003      2004

New water connections are assumed to increase at 100/month; new sewer connections to increase at about
200/month until 2001; and water supply to increase by about 11% in 2002, and 12% in 2003, as a result of
rehabilitation of existing boreholes (completed in 2002) and new boreholes brought in production from the Al-
Sabeen wellfield (completed in 2002). The unaccounted for water (UFW) is assumed to decrease by 3%, from
29% in 1999 to 26% in 2000 through 2004. The sewerage charge is based on water tariffs, that is at 70% of
water tariff in 1999, 80% in 2000, 90% in 2001-2002, and 100% in 2003-2004.
There's a minimum charge of equivalent to 5m3 to those consuming water at 0-5 m3 per month. Water tariffs are
based on the existing tariff schedule and are assumed to increase (as shown below), in order to meet the financial

covenant of covering O&M costs on a cash basis in 1999-2000; and then coverage of O&M costs, debt service (if
any) and 5% of next year's investment from 2001- 2004. For the Base Case Scenario, the needed tariffs would be as
shown in Table A5.3.

The monthly billing loss factor is estimated at 10% in 1999, 7% in 2000-2001, 5% in 2002-2003, and 3% in 2004.
The improvement is expected as a result of the improvements in the collection and meter reading system,
installation of accurate meters and timely input of data in the recently installed Oracle Financial Management
system.
NWSA Headquarters has assumed the outstanding arrears for electricity, and the electricity accounts payable has
been converted into NWSA Headquarter's equity contribution. The monthly electricity consumption is based on
1.49kWh/m3. The electricity price is expected to increase yearly by YR I/kWh, going from YR 12/kWh in 1999
to YR 18/kWh in 2004.
In conformity with GOY's Civil Service Reform Program, a yearly 10% reduction in the number of staff is
assumed, starting 1999 onwards. The yearly salary increases is estimated at about 10% in 1999, 7% in 2000-
2001, and 6.5% thereafter. There's an estimated bonus and incentives of about YR 4m in 1999, YR 5m in 2000,
YR 6 m in 2001 through 2004.
Accounts receivable in the Base Case are assumed to equal three months of sales starting in 1999 and remain at
this level. The provision for doubtful accounts is estimated at 8% of accounts receivable per year. In accordance
with the International Accounting Standards, NWSA Sana'a Branch would establish the amounts of obsolete
inventory and uncollectible accounts and obtain authorization from the Central Organization for Control and
Audits to write these off the branch's accounting books, when applicable.
The GOY has agreed that proceeds of the IDA Credit will be passed to the Sana'a Branch as a grant contribution
to equity. Government equity also represents grant contributions for capital investments in Sana'a sewerage
treatment plant, including its operations and maintenance costs (excluding electricity and consumables) for the
next 3 years, 2001-2003.

Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
A. PROCUREMENT
The Credit would finance the procurement of:
(a)    works associated with the laying of a new sewer trunk main, the laying and connection of sewers
and the rehabilitation of water system networks;
(b)    goods, consisting of office supplies and one vehicle; and
(c)    services for (i) engineering supervision of project implementation; (ii) technical assistance,
consisting of studies, short-term technical experts; (iii) training; (iv) staffing and funding the PMU.
A General Procurement notice for the Project was first published in United Nations Developmnent Business
on January 16, 1998 (page 7). The "Invitation for Prequalification" for the first three civil works contracts was
published in United Nationis Develop,nient Business on April 30, 1998. An updated General Procurement Notice will
be published in the same newspaper when the Credit is approved by IDA's Board of Directors.
The procurement arrangements and the estimated costs for the project components to be financed by IDA
are shown in Table A.
The Government and IDA have signed a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) in the amount of
US$2.0 million to cover the cost of detailed designs and civil works contracts for the initial two years of civil works
under the project. It also financed the start-up and initial work of the PMU.
Procurement under the IDA credit would be carried out in accordance with The World Bank 's Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits (revised January 1999) and Guidelines for Selection and
Emnploymzent of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (revised January 1999). The Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents (SBD) would be used for all procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and, with
modifications acceptable to IDA and in the Arabic language, for National Competitive Bidding (NCB). The
Bank's Standard Request for Proposals: Selection of Consultants (April 1998) would be used for all consulting
services selected through international competition.
Civil Works: Contracts exceeding an estimated value of US$ 1.0 million equivalent would be procured
using ICB procedures and documents, as described in the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits. Contracts below US$1.0 million would be procured using NCB procedures and documents, as
described in the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.
Goods: Packages valued above US$500,000 would be procured using ICB procedures and documents
and advertisements in Developmnent Business and at least two national newspapers. Bidders would be subject to
post-qualification in accordance with IDA's standard bidding document for Procurement of Goods (January
1995). Bids would be evaluated with IDA's standard Bid Evaluation Form Procurement of Goods and Works
(April 1996). Goods, including supplies, at estimated contract values below US$500,000 per procurement, up to
an aggregate amount of US$ 1.0 million equivalent, would be procured using NCB procedures and documents and
advertisements in at least two national newspapers. Office furniture and equipment for the PMU below
US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 100,000, would follow National Shopping/International Shopping
(NS/IS) procedures, using simplified documents and procedures for soliciting, receiving, and evaluating
competitive quotations from a minimum of three capable suppliers. Incidental goods and supplies below a cost of

US$5,000 per purchase, up to an aggregate amount of US$20,000, would be purchased directly from the nearest
available source.
Services. For consulting services above an estimated contract value of US$ 100,000 equivalent, the
selection method would be Quality and Cost-Based (QCBS). For consultancies below this threshold, the selection
would follow the Quality-Based (QBS), Consultants' Qualifications-Based (CQ) or Single-Source Selection (SS)
methods, depending on the nature of the assignment. All individual consulting assignments would be quality
based only. Agreement on the terms of reference and single source selections would precede the selection of all
consultants.
Implementation. Procurement is well advanced for several items. The first three civil works contracts
(totaling about US$11 million) have been tendered following IDA's Guidelines and IDA has given its no
objection for award. These contracts will be awarded upon credit effectiveness. Design and preparation of tender
packages for the next civil works contracts is started. The design and supervising consultants are already under
contract (procured under the PPF and according to IDA's Guidelines for the Selectioni and Emnployment of
Consultants).
Prior Review: All contracts awarded through ICB procedures would be subject to prior review by IDA,
as would all services contracts. The prior review process would also cover the first three works and goods
contracts, irrespective of the amount or purpose. All other contracts would be subject to post-review on a random
basis during supervision missions and procurement audits. All consultants' contracts would be subject to prior
review. The contract review arrangements are summarized in Table B.
Procuremnent Responsibilities: The PMU will have primary responsibility for procurement under the
project. The PMU would be assisted by the consulting engineering firm engaged under the project for
engineering design and supervision. This firm would help the PMU supervise all contracts, advise the PMU on
all procurement-related matters, endorse all payment and variation orders, and accept the commissioning of all
works, goods, and services related to the project on behalf of NWSA. The PMU project manager is responsible
to the Sana'a Executive Board for successful implementation of the project. With the support of these managerial
and advisory services, the PMU would undertake all procurement activities that require ICB and NCB procedures
and the selection of all consultants, with the exception of: (i) activities related to the design and implementation of
the sector reform plan and institutional building in the Sana'a Branch; and (ii) some activities related to the Water
Resources component. Consultant selection and other procurement activities related to these two activities would
be the responsibility of the Technical Secretariat and NWRA, respectively.
During supervision, IDA staff would continue to devote particular attention to ensuring compliance with
IDA procurement policies and procedures, involving IDA procurement specialists in this respect. IDA would
arrange for training of the PMU staff to become familiar with IDA procurement guidelines and procedures as part of
its supervision activities.
Procuremnent Planning. The initial procurement plan is shown in Table D and would be updated
periodically by the PMU for review during IDA supervision missions.

B. DISBURSEMENTS AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Overview. A Special Account for the Project would be maintained in the Central Bank of Yemen and operated by
the NWSA-PMU (PMU) of the Project. The authorized allocation of the Special Account would be S2.5 million
which represents about 4 months of estimated disbursements from the IDA Credit. The authorized allocation
would be $1.5 million until the aggregate disbursements from the IDA Credit reach the equivalent of US$5
million. The Special Account would be operated in accordance with the IDA's operational policies.
Disbursements would initially be made against Withdrawal Applications for reimbursements of expenditure with
full documentation, reimbursement of expenditures against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). and direct
payments. It was agreed at Negotiations that the PMU would operate the project financial management system
and produce quarterly Project Management Reports (PMRs) from the system: and that PMU would take
necessary steps to enable conversion of disbursements to the IDA's new PMR-based disbursement procedures as
soon as possible. The target date for this conversion would be not later than March 31, 2000. An assessment of
the project financial management system, and actions to be taken, are given below.
Assessmlenit of Finianzcial Alanagemient S! stemii. The main implementing agency, the PMU, is a non-revenue
eaming entity. It has established and is operating a computerized accounting system (using Yemen-SOFT).
IDA's appraisal of the accounting system indicates that: (i) a good accounting system has been established and is
operational, (ii) accounting books are maintained on double-entry system and are up to date; (iii) the staff has
been trained to carry out basic accounting functions: (iv) a reasonable system of intemal controls is in place: (v)
a draft Accounting Manual has been prepared which documents the various accounting systems and procedures;
and (vi) there is a plan for a good system of transaction audit (by a private audit firm) which would be an added
intemal control mechanism. Financial information from the accounting system is used to prepare various
management reports, although to a limited extent.
The PMU has initiated steps to further develop its financial management system for the project, with the
assistance of a consultant (a qualified Chartered Accountant). A draft Financial Manual of Procedures has been
prepared to document the operation of the project Financial Management System. The Financial Manual of
Procedures covers the following aspects: (i) flow of funds; (ii) financial and accounting policies; (iii) project
accounting system, information flows and intemal control mechanisms; (iv) Chart of Accounts; (v) financial
management reports and budgeting: (vi) auditing arrangements; and (vii) staffing for financial management
functions. The Financial Manual of Procedures would be periodically updated and improved based on
implementation experience.
Flowv of Funds: GOY would pass on the IDA funds to the PMU through deposits to the Special Account in the
Central Bank of Yemen. During Negotiations, it was agreed that proceeds of the IDA Credit would be passed to
NWSA at no cost, with the GOY bearing the Credit's foreign exchange risk. GOY would provide counterpart
funds for the project, also as its equity contribution, through a budgetary allocation under a Ministry of Finance
single budget item called the "Sana'a Water Supply Project". The allocation would include both the GOY's
counterpart funds and proceeds from the IDA Credit. The PMU would utilize part of the project funds for its own
expenditures, those of the Sana'a Executive Board, and for payments to the consultants and contractors for
project-related expenditures on the basis of their agreed work plans.
Finiancial and Accounting Policies: Financial and accounting policies for the project will be developed and
included in the Financial Manual of Procedures. These policies, inter alia, cover the following aspects: (i)
expenditures which would be treated as project expenditures including their classification; (ii) expenditures which
would be eligible for reimbursement from the IDA Credit; (iii) provision of advances to the PMU, and accounting
of funds provided to the PMU; and (iv) project accounting policies. These policies would be gradually expanded
and refined to include aspects such as efficient management and deployment of funds, intemal control policies,
and related items. The PMU would comply with the financial and accounting policies of the project indicated in

the Financial Manual of Procedures.
Project Accounting System: The PMU would be responsible for overall project financial management and
accounting. The PMU would maintain books of accounts for the project, prepare and disseminate financial
statements and financial management reports, and ensure timely audit of the financial statements.
Overall Project Accounting Principles. The overall principles for project accounting are outlined below:
(i) books of accounts for the project would be maintained by the PMU on double-entry bookkeeping principles.
Project accounts would be maintained using the computerized accounting system which has been developed and
is operational in the PMU;
(ii) project accounting would cover all sources of project funds (including GOY counterpart contributions), and
the utilization of all project funds. This would include payments made to, and expenditures incurred by, all
implementing agencies. All project-related transactions (whether involving cash or not) would be accounted for in
the books of accounts. Disbursements made by IDA and through the Special Account would also be included in
the project accounting system. Should there be funds received from other donors, these would be identified
separately and reflected in the project accounts and financial statements;
(iii) project-related transactions and activities would be distinguished from other activities of the PMU. This
distinction would be effected at the data-capture stage. A quarterly Trial Balance for the project capturing all
project receipts, expenditures, and other payments under the project would be prepared;
(iv) project Financial Statements and financial reports would be fully based on the project books of accounts, and
substantially generated from the financial accounting system; and
(v) physical information on key performance indicators, which can be readily linked to financial costs, would be
maintained as part of the project financial management system. Initially this would be maintained for some high
cost items which account for a significant portion of project cost, and for items for which data on physical
activities can be easily captured. These items have been identified and indicated in the Financial Manual of
Procedures. This list would be gradually expanded during implementation.
Information Flow. The Project's information flow for accounting purposes is described as follows:
(i) the PMU would generate and maintain vouchers and supporting documentation for expenditures on activities
directly managed by PMU;
(ii) the PMU would maintain books of accounts on double entry bookkeeping principles, for activities under the
project. PMU would provide a monthly summary statement of expenditure based on the books of accounts, along
with other information and documents (details given in the Financial Manual of Procedures), to enable it to account
for these expenditures;
(iii) PMU would maintain separate (distinct) books and records in respect of transactions for activities under the
project; and
(iv) this system would be reviewed in the light of implementation experience, and modified as necessary.
Intemal Controls. The project financial management system includes the following internal control mechanisms:
(i) operation of a budgeting system, and regular monitoring of actual financial performance with budgets and targets;
(ii) adoption and operation of simple, clear and transparent financial and accounting policies which would govern

financial management of and accounting for the project (as described earlier). These policies and procedures are
included in the Financial Manual of Procedures;
(iii) at the transaction level, establishment and operation of policies, procedures and systems for ensuring standard
internal controls such as checking of expenditures, appropriate documentation, levels of authorization, description of
responsibilities and duties, periodic reconciliation, physical verification, etc. These policies and procedures are
given in the draft Financial Manual of Procedures and would be reviewed and updated periodically; and
(iv) establishment and operation of a comprehensive audit mechanism with qualified external auditors, including
quarterly reviews (as described below).
Chart of Accounts. A Chart of Accounts for the project has already been prepared. The Chart of Accounts
conforms to the classification of expenditures and sources of funds indicated in the project documents (Project
Implementation Plan and Project Appraisal Document). The Chart of Accounts enables data to be captured in a
manner as to facilitate financial reporting of project expenditures by: (i) project components; (ii) expenditure
categories; and (iii) disbursement categories.
Financial Management Reports and Budgetinig. Quarterly financial management reports for the project would be
generated from the computerized financial management system. These reports would be management-oriented
(i.e., summaries rather than transactional details) and would be used for project management by PMU. The
reports would include: (i) a comparison of budgeted and actual expenditure and analysis of major variances,
including on sources and application of funds (by components, expenditure categories and PMU), and on physical
parameters and unit rates for selected key items; (ii) expenditures by disbursement categories; and (iii) forecasts
for the next 2 quarters. Formats of the reports are given in the Financial Manual of Procedures.
Auditing Arrangements. The accounts and financial statements of the project would be audited by a qualified private
accountants, acceptable to IDA, who would be the Project Auditors. The annual project financial statements audited
by the private auditors would be submitted to the IDA within 6 months of the close of GOY's fiscal year. The Terms
of Reference (TOR) and qualifications of the Chartered Accountants are included in the Financial Manual of
Procedures and have been reviewed by IDA. The cost of the audit by the firm of Chartered Accountants would be
eligible for financing from IDA's Credit. IDA's Guidelines for Selection and Employrnent of Consultants would
apply to the engagement of the Chartered Accountants.
The audit by the Project Auditor would be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the project (i.e., all sources and
utilization of funds, and expenditures incurred by the PMU). The audit will be carried out in accordance with
International Standards of Auditing. The Terms of Reference of the auditors includes both an audit of financial
transactions, and an assessment of the operation of the financial management system, including a review of intemal
control mechanisms. All implementing agencies would provide the auditor with access to project-related documents
and records, and information required by the auditor for the purposes of the audit. The audit would also cover any
cost-based consultancy or other contracts for which no supporting documentation is provided to PMU. The Project
Auditor would also carry out a review at the end of each quarter, to bring to management's attention any issues
which may be required to be addressed. This would strengthen intemal controls, and would also facilitate early
completion of the annual audit.
The Project Auditor would be appointed before the start of the project. The Auditors would initially be appointed for
one year. Depending on satisfactory performance, the contract could be extended for an additional period.
Audited Project Financial Statements (PFS) would be submitted to IDA. PFS would include: (i) a Balance Sheet, an
Income Statement, a Statement of Source and Uses of Funds and any other schedules and reports considered relevant
by the auditor or required by IDA. The annual audit would also include: (i) appropriate schedules classifying project

expenditures by components, expenditure categories, and implementing agencies; (ii) a Special Account
Reconciliation Statement; and (iii) a Statement of Withdrawals from the IDA Credit made on the basis of Statements
of Expenditure (SOEs).
Staffing: Currently the PMU's key finance and accounting staff is the Financial Manager, acting on a part-time basis
because of the low level of Project activity. The PMU will appoint the Finance Manager to a full-time basis once
the work load so merits. To augment its financial management capabilities, the PMU will also recruit an Information
Management Specialist to assist the Financial Manager.
Areas for Improvement. Overall, the financial management system documented in the Financial Manual of
Procedures is satisfactory. There is, however, scope for improvement and the following items should be
addressed during the first year of the Project and before the PMR-based disbursement procedures are
implemented: (i) presentation of financial information in a clear, simple, user-friendly and consistent form, (ii) the
use of financial reporting/financial statements as a project management tool to improve accountability; (iii)
development of internal controls by the PMU on checking and accounting of expenditures incurred by its
consultants and contractors; (iv) establishment of procedures to verify that all project-related activities are
reflected in the project accounts and financial statements; and (v) documentation the of operation of the
computerized system and controls over data integrity.
Other areas for improvement, that should be accomplished by IDA's mid-term review (scheduled for February
2001), include: (i) ensuring better linkages between physical and financial activities, including expanding the items
for which physical data is captured in the financial management system; and (ii) developing and implementing
internal service standards for all finance and accounting functions.
These, as well as other improvements, would be addressed during project implementation on a continual basis.
Readiness for Implementation and Next Steps. Financial Management System: The design of the Financial
Management System is substantially advanced. A draft Financial Manual of Procedures documenting the financial
management system has been prepared; and will be finalized shortly after review and incorporation of suggestions
from IDA and its consultants. The computerization of the FMS would be improved to meet the PMR-based
disbursement requirements. Appointment of Auditors: Draft Terms of Reference for the financial audit of the project
have been prepared; and the process of recruitment of a private auditors acceptable to IDA has begun. The auditors
are expected to be appointed by September 1, 1999.
Risks. There are two main risks relating to financial management aspects of the Project: (i) weak internal accounting
controls and procedures in the Sana'a Branch; and (ii) delays in preparation of project management reports. These
risks and the associated risk-mitigation measures are outlined below. Both these risks are considered as manageable
as long as the identified risk-mitigation measures are implemented. Accordingly, these measures will be monitored
closely as part of project supervision.
First, accounting and internal control mechanisms for expenditures in the Sana'a Branch need strengthening. The
Sana'a Branch uses a government accounting system, which is not fully satisfactory in its reporting regime,
budgetary controls and the requirement for employing qualified financial staff. This risk is mitigated by the
following factors: (i) all Project expenditures are made by the PMU; (ii) establishment of implementation
procedures for all Project components, including a Project Implementation Memorandum of Understanding
between the PMU, NWRA and TS (the MOUs to be drafted and agreed at Project Launch); (iii) an annual audit of
all Project expenditures by the project auditor; (iv) a quarterly review by the project auditor; and (v) provision to
modify these arrangements based on implementation experience.

Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project      Page 57                                     Project Appraisal Document
The second risk is that preparation of the project management reports would be delayed and that the quality of the
reports may be variable or unsatisfactory, especially given that PMU has not previously prepared project financial
statements. The risk-mitigation factors here are: (i) design of a comprehensive financial management system; (ii)
computerization of the financial management system; (iii) appointment of a full-time and qualified financial
manager; and (iv) pending the establishment of Project Management Reports (PMRs), disbursements will be made
on the traditional reimbursement basis. (Disbursements will be converted to the PMR-based method, after the
financial management system is satisfactorily operated.)
Conceming implementation of the mitigation measures for both risks, IDA supervision missions will closely monitor
the progress of PMU staff in their installation and use of the new systems (including PMRs), and will provide
assistance to the PMU and Sana'a Branch as, and when, needed.

Summary of Environmental Assessment
The Environmental Review and Assessment
The proposed project has been reviewed, screened, and designated for Category B consistent with the
provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E, "Environmental Assessment". There are no major
environmental issues involved. Further, there are no land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, indigenous
people or cultural heritage issues. The Project has no effect on international waterways. The Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared by the Borrower with the assistance of international consultants and is
available in the Project File, the Public Information Center, and the PMU and consulting engineer offices in
Sana'a, as well as NWSA Headquarters. It comprises three elements:
* Project Description and Statement of Baseline Conditions
*  Impact Statement
- Environmental Management Plan
In the EIA, extensive use is made of two household and commercial establishment surveys undertaken as part of
project preparation activities (summaries included in the Project File).
Major Environmental Issues and Mitigation Measures
The project has three main environmental issues, none of which are considered major or which will cause
irreparable harm to the environment after the application of the proposed mitigation measure. These issues are:
(i) cesspit removal, and disposal of cesspit sewage during the initial months of construction; (ii) the disposition of
dried sewage sludge; and (iii) the handling of chemicals used to flush rehabilitated or new water lines.
Cesspit Removal and Disposal of Sewage:
Description. Before the new wastewater treatment plant is operational in December 1999, a maximum of 600
cesspits will need to be destroyed. This represents about 90 m3 per day of wastewater, or a maximum of about
9,000 m3 for the four months. This sewage will be trucked to the existing pond wastewater treatment plant for
disposal. This existing plant is often over-loaded and, therefore, not achieving design standards for treatment.
Given the desire to remove raw sewage from the crowded Akama residential and commercial neighborhood as
soon as possible, it is considered the better alternative to remove the sewage and carry it to the existing pond
treatment plant than to wait for the opening of the new wastewater treatment facility. This is especially the case
in light of the modest sewage quantities involved and the planned mitigation program described below.
Mitigation. Prior to construction, community leaders will be advised of the details of work in their area.
Measures to prevent casual public access to the site will be undertaken, with particular emphasis on children.
Open pits in the construction areas will be covered at night in such a way that they cannot be casually uncovered.
During the first four months of the project, liquid wastes will be transported to, and disposed into, the existing
pond WWTP. Given that this treatment plant is already operating at or over capacity during peak hours, wastes
will be transferred in off-peak, hours. Site supervisors will be present at both the construction and treatment plant
to register vehicles, and to ensure that unauthorized dump sites are not used. Monitoring of coliform levels in the
ponds will be undertaken to ensure that health in the area of the WWTP is not being endangered. Aeration
devises may be used, if feasible, to improve treatment effectiveness.

Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project   Page 68                                  Project Appraisal Document
After the initial four month period, the new WWTP is expected to be operational. It will easily handle all wastes
from the destruction of the remaining approximately 2,400 cesspits. Operating specifications and capacities of the
new plant are included as an appendix to the EIA.
Dried Sewage Sludge:
Description. The new wastewater treatment plant will produce about 32 tons per day of sludge with a 30 percent
moisture content. The plant site has a storage area that will accommodate approximately 15 months of
accumulation. The government has no policy on the use of dried sludge and has not identified a final dumping
site or other disposition measures.
Mitigation. Dried sludge from the existing WWTP is being sold to local farmers, who compost it, and there is
enough demand to dispose of an estimated 80,000 tons per year. However, a formal wastewater and sludge reuse
policy will be developed with assistance from IDA as part of the Project (see Environmental Mitigation component
in Annex 3).
Disposal of Hazardous Chemicals:
Description. Hazardous chemicals will be used as a normal procedure during the final stages of the water system
rehabilitation component. The Project involves the installation or rehabilitation of 27 kilometers of pipe, ranging
in size from 80mm to 600mm, and the amount of chemicals necessary for flushing is expected to be modest.
Pipes will be flushed with 40-50 ppm chlorine gas over a 24 hour period.
Mitigation. The contractor will be responsible for training workers on the handling of such chemicals, and
providing suitable safety gear. Spill prevention and counter-control measures for hazardous chemicals will be
specified in a contingency plan (included in the EIA Appendix). Spills of hazardous materials will be promptly
cleaned up and chemically treated. Workers handling these spills will wear overalls and gloves in addition to any
other protective equipment that may be needed. Wastewater containing hazardous chemicals will be routed to the
new wastewater treatment plant and the feed rate of hazardous chemicals limited to levels that can be handled by
the plant. Hazardous chemical treatment training will be provided to wastewater treatment plant staff. Finally,
compliance with the proposed provisions will be monitored by a Safety and Environment officer in the PMU.
Secondary Environmental Issues and Mitigation Measures
Employee Health and Safety:
Soil in project areas will be sampled to test for contamination. In the case of minimal risk, simple mitigation
measures will consist of wearing appropriate clothing, and education of workers. In the case of more severe
contamination, waste material will be excavated and taken to an appropriate NWSA and EPC approved site.
Public Safety:
A number of public health and safety measures are addressed to limit risk of an accident involving the public.
These would include erecting appropriate fences and walkways to permit safe passage of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic in and around the site. Heavy equipment use will be supervised by on-site inspectors.
Public Health:
As part of the public information campaign, the population shall be advised as to the nature and extent of the
works proposed. Capacities of local hospitals and clinics will be assessed and, if deemed necessary, a project

clinic will be established in project areas without easy access to existing facilities.
Collection, Storage and Disposal of Household Wastewater:
The contractor will establish a special unit to specifically handle this task. This unit will dispose of the wastewater
in a manner that prevents spillage of wastewater. All such wastes will be transported to the inlet sump of the
WWTP, and will not be handled by any workers outside of the designated unit.
Abatement of Noise and Air Pollution:
A detailed plan for the control of noise pollution is included in the EA. The measures to be undertaken will
include proper maintenance of equipment, erection of screens, use of muffling devices to minimize both dust and
noise pollution, and strict monitoring of vehicular traffic used in project works. Noise and dust levels will be kept
within recommended Bank and Yemeni standards.
Public Consultation Process
Despite the fact that this type of category "B" environmental project does not require a public consultation program,
the Government of Yemen has nevertheless implemented an extensive program of public awareness and consultation
. This program comprises three components: (i) public meetings; (ii) newspaper and television articles and
programs; and (iii) household surveys. Each of these are summarized below:
Public Meetings. To date there have been 3 public meetings about the project. The first was on July 26 1997, and
the latest took place on February 21 1998. Another meeting is scheduled before the start of construction, and further
meetings are planned during the construction period. On average, these public meetings are attended by about 30 to
35 people living in the affected neighborhoods. Topics discussed typically include the deterioration of sewerage
conditions, the duration of construction, and the number of households served.
Newspaper and Television Coverage. To date, there have been 5 newspaper articles about the project. The first
appeared on May 22, 1998, and the most recent was on November 16, 1998. In general, the articles discuss
sewerage problems, what the project will do to alleviate these problems, and reports on the status of the project. On
October 25, 1997, the PMU Director for the Project, among others, were on a live television show discussing
potential impacts of the projects' works, and answering questions on how to facilitate the construction process.
Household Surveys. Characteristics of the two household surveys undertaken prior to the start of the project are
summarized in the following table:

Results of the surveys show that households consider street flooding from cesspit overflow to be the most
important environmental consideration in their neighborhoods. The Project plans a follow-up survey in the
Akamah area half-way through its implementation period, which is estimated to be one year after the sewage
network has been completed.
Overall Cost of the Project's Environmental Program
A summary and the cost of the Project's environmental assessment, mitigation and monitoring program is

Conclusions
The overall impact of the Project is to significantly improve environmental conditions at every phase of the
project cycle, but particularly in the Akamah area. Until completion of the new WWTP, environmental impacts
from the disposal of cesspit sewage at the existing WWTP are expected to be minimal, and any adverse impact is
outweighed by the immediate improvements in the Akamah area. The environmental review concludes that the
proposed project will generate overwhelmingly positive environmental, social and economic impacts. With its
mitigation measures, the project does not present negative environmental consequences. Detailed discussion of
all items, including the complete mitigation plan and item-by-item costs, are included in the EIA which is part of
the Project File. TOR for IDA supervision missions, concerning the Project's environmental issues, are also
included in the Project File.
