IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SULTANATE OF OMAN
HEALTH PROJECT
(LOAN 2807-OMA)
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Health Project in the Sultanate of
Oman, for which Loan No. 2807-OMA in the amount of US$ 13.3 million equivalent was approved on
May 5, 1987 and made effective on March 1, 1988.
2.    The Loan was closed on May 31, 1994 corresponding to the original closing date. Final
disbursement took place on October 13, 1994, and a balance of US$ 5,412,092.54 was canceled on
December 20, 1994, the date on which cancellation was requested by the Borrower.
3 .    The ICR was prepared by the Human Resources Division (MN2HR) of the Middle East and
North Africa Region and was reviewed by Mr. Jacques Baudouy, Division Chief (MN2HR) and
Ms. Tufan Kolan, Acting Project Advisor (MN2DR).
4 .    Preparation of this ICR started during the completion mission in April 1995. It is based on
material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR through its
participation in the completion mission, and in preparing its own evaluation of the project's
implementation phase.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SULTANATE OF OMAN
HEALTH PROJECT
(Loan 2807-OMA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The project was designed during the Government's Second Five-Year Development Plan (1981-
85). Health indicators for Oman were considered poor in comparison to middle-income countries, and
in some instances approximated indicators for Sub-Saharan Africa. Oman's health sector strategy
concentrated on providing primary health care to meet the health needs of underserved areas, primarily
rural populations and women and children, in order to address high maternal and infant mortality.
Subsequent five-year development plans (third and fourth) continued this emphasis and all the
components of the Health Project were incorporated into the Government's health sector strategy.
There was no relevant prior Bank involvement in the health sector in Oman.
Project Objectives
2.    The project's objectives were to: (a) reduce mortality and morbidity, targeting the 300,000
inhabitants of the predominantly rural Batinah region; (b) strengthen Government's health planning and
management capacity; and (c) strengthen the health care delivery system in support of the health sector
strategy.
3.    The project was to be implemented over five years and included components to: (a) develop
health services by establishing a Basic Health Delivery System in Batinah Region as a model for the
rest of the country, a Regional Training system, and by strengthening health promotion; and (b)
strengthen the Ministry of Health's (MOH) existing Statistical Unit, establish a financial management
section within the Directorate of Finance, and provide accounting, procurement and architectural
assistance.
Implementaion Experience and Results
Achievement of Objectives and Project Sustainability
4.    The project objectives were well conceived, specific and consistent with the Government's
health sector strategy. The project achieved objectives (a) and (c), but objective (b) was only partially
met. Under the first objective, the model health care delivery system was established in Batinah and by
the end of the project, 81 percent of the population was receiving expanded and improved health care.
Under the third objective, new health policies were introduced, enabling the MOH to integrate
preventive and curative health care and to then decentralize the delivery system first to the regional
level (1990) and subsequently to the district level (1992). The second objective - health planning and
management strengthening - was partially met. For example, while the Financial Planning &
Management Systems Unit (FPMS) was established and started operating, the numbers and skills of
staff were inadequate (Table 5). In addition, only one of three planned studies was completed (Table
7).



- Hii -
5.    The failure to achieve all the objectives, as well as the lengthy initial delays in implementation
(civil works were delayed by three years) were due to the following problems:
- a delay in deciding the type of facility designs by the MOH,1 thus postponing the
commencement of civil works for three years;
- problems in recruiting technical assistance resulting in slow placement of consultants
for the institutional strengthening process;
- recurring difficulties in obtaining counterpart funds from MOFE for annual
work programs;
- limited managerial capacity of MOH;
- a slow start-up of the fellowship and training programs3; and
- the government's evolving health policy which impacted on the project.
6.    A change in project management staff (a new project director) in the last two years of the
project sped up implementation and largely made up for past delays. Project sustainability is likely as
the Government is providing adequate budgetary resources to the health sector and the MOH is firmly
committed to its health sector strategy of which the project is an important component. To ensure
continued sustainability the MOH must focus on improving its human resource capacities, particularly
in planning and finance. It will also have to reassess its health sector financing policy in order to
respond to population growth, and the increasing demand for and cost of health care.
7.     Final project costs amounted to US$26.0 million compared with the appraisal estimate of
US$30.6 million. US$5.4 million (41 percent) of the Bank loan was canceled. The shortfall in the use
of the Bank loan was due to: (a) grant funds becoming available to the Government to finance technical
assistance and training; (b) a reduction in equipment, vehicles and materials purchased following
changes in facility design; and (c) disbursement problems (see paras. 16 and 17 of Part 1).
Key Factors Affecting Outcome
8.    The problems reviewed above (para. 5) clearly affected project outcome. Another related and
compounding factor was the rapidly changing health environment in which the project was developed
and implemented. The MOH continued to modify its strategy (e.g. the decision to change the health
referral system by introducing polyclinics) in ways that affected project implementation. Specifically,
two polyclinics, one hospital and three health centers were built instead of ten health centers which
were planned. Key factors that contributed positively to project outcome are: (a) technical and
advisory support from the MOFE and the Ministry of Development; and (b) progressive improvement
in MOH leadership and an impressive learning curve on the part of the MOH managers and staff both
with respect to the project as well as to health sector development in general.
' This was due to two main reasons: lack of consensus within MOH as to appropriate facility design and a national
change in the health sector referral system (introduction of polyclinics).
2Mainly because counterpart funds provided by MOFE were released through the annual budget.
3 Strategy for nurses training took three years to be completed.

Bank and Borrower Performance
9.    While lank perfonnce was satisfactory with regard to project identification and supervision,
preparation and particularly appraisal could have been better. Bank preparation missions should have
ensured more complete MOH ownership of the project concept and design, and analyzed more fully the
division of administrative responsibilities within the Government. The appraisal mission should have
ensured complete agreement on architectural designs to minimize delays during project implementation.
Borrower performance overall was satisfactory. Lack of project experience, difficulty in obtaining
operating funds, and limited technical and managerial capacity at the start of project implementation
caused delays. Project management subsequently improved. Legal covenants were complied with
except for the studies covenant.
Sunmnary of Findings, Future Operations, Key Lessons Learned
10.   The project objectives were well conceived, specific and consistent with health sector strategy.
While two objectives were met, the third was only partially met. Failure to assess accurately during
project preparation the ability of the MOH to manage the project (para. 9) and to ensure complete
agreement of architectural designs at appraisal resulted in implementation delays and also resulted in
underutilization of the Bank loan on which the Government continued to pay commitment fees.
uture Oqperations
11.   The Sultanate of Oman has graduated from being a borrower. However the MOH has stated
informally that it wants to develop a technical assistance relationship with the Bank for future health
sector needs in the context of the Bank's Technical Cooperation Program.
Key Lessons Learned
12.   It is necessary to pay close attention to the roles of the relevant ministries, MOH and MOFE, in
implementation. The existing institutional arrangements and structure and the absorptive capacity of
the Borrower and sector ministry must be assessed in detail with regard to implementation mechanisms
and project management arrangements. In particular, the division of responsibilities between the
MOFE and MOH for project management and financing, the managerial capacity of the MOH as well
as the Borrower's administrative, budgetary and procurement systems should have been fully assessed.
The result of this assessment should have been fully reflected in the eventual implementation
arrangements.
13.   In hindsight it would also have been useful to do an explicit stakeholder analysis. The Bank
might then have taken into account better the division of responsibility between the MOH and the
MOFE in designing the managerial and administrative arrangements proposed for the project, and have
ensured the full involvement of all the stakeholders in project design and preparation.
14.   Architectural designs for the clinics should have been agreed during appraisal and confirmed
during negotiations.
15.   The Bank should have been more insistent that the baseline survey was carried out as this was
central to the monitoring and evaluation system.



- v -
16.   For the future the MOH should focus on continued strengthening of its human resources, and
might consider carrying out a review of health costs and financing.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
HEALTH PROJECT
(LOAN 2807-OMA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Project Objectives
1.    The objectives of the Project were to: (a) reduce mortality and morbidity, targeting the
300,000 inhabitants of the predominantly rural Batinah region; (b) strengthen Government's
institutional capacity to plan and manage the health sector; and (c) support the institution building
processes necessary for the country-wide implementation of a more efficient and integrated health care
delivery system.
2 .   The project was to be implemented over five years and would provide funds for civil works,
equipment, furniture, vehicles, materials, drugs and supplies, technical assistance, fellowships and
training, and incremental operating costs. The project components included:
Part A: Health Services Development
(i)   Establishing Basic Health Care Delivery System in Batinah Region
(ii)   Establishing Regional Training
(iii)   Strengthening Health Promotion
Part B: Institutional Development
(i)   Upgrading the existing Statistical Unit of the Directorate of Statistics, Planning and
Follow-up (DSPF) to a Health Information Section within the DSPF;
(ii)   Establishing a Financial and Management Section within the Directorate of Finance of
the MOH; and
(iii)   Providing for accounting, procurement and architectural assistance to the Project
Coordinator to ensure that Project activities are well coordinated.
3.    In order to achieve the objectives: (a) appropriate infrastructure was to be developed to
improve primary health care coverage to meet the needs of the regions where most of the rural
population was underserved; (b) integration of preventive and curative care was to be developed within
a program of basic health care services directed to the rural population. The basic health care delivery
system in the Batinah Region was to serve as a model for different regions of the Sultanate; (c)
capacity building was an integral component of the project to ensure appropriate manpower
development through intensifying training and recruitment programs; and (d) the design included
strengthening of institutional capability to enable MOH to plan and manage the health sector. This was
supported by the Initiating Project Brief (September 30,1983, Oman Project File) which stated that 'the
predicted pattern of mortality and morbidity in adults and children in Oman suggests that health status



- 2 -
can be improved by the development of systematic basic health care and preventive activities at the
local level".
Evaluation of Project Objectives and Project Design
4.    The project objectives were well conceived, specific and consistent with the planned sector goal
to improve the health status of the target population. This was within the context of the "Oman:
Population, Health and Nutrition Sector Memorandum" (Yellow Cover Report dated October 30, 1984,
Oman Project Files). The importance of achieving these objectives were outlined in the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (Country Programs, Departmental letter July 29, 1983-Oman Project
File). MOH had recognized (a) that services were concentrated on the few urban areas; (b) the limited
health benefits from greater focus and increasing expenditures on curative care; (c) the unmet health
needs of the underserved rural populations (especially women and children); and (d) the cost-effective
benefits that may accrue from improved preventive health care.
5.    The project was developed in a rapidly changing health environment: (a) Oman was a high
income oil-exporting economy which had been undergoing rapid modernization over the last 16 years;
(b) the population was growing rapidly (growth rate in 1987 was estimated at 4.5%); and (c) the
demand for health services was increasing.
6.    Project appraisal identified high maternal and infant mortality' and rapid population growth as
significant issues in the sector.  However, preparation missions noted a high sensitivity to the
population issue in Oman which was then strongly pro-natalist. Consequently, no direct mention of a
family planning program was made in the appraised program of basic health care services.
7.    Even though the risk of limited implementation capacity was recognized at implementation, it
was underestimated. The project design failed to take sufficiently into account: (a) the limitation in
MOH's absorptive capacity regarding rate of project inputs and processes (e.g., in operating project
budget, processing procurement actions, etc.); (b) the system of clearances and review under which
technical assistance and fellowships awards were administered; (c) the division of management,
administrative, procurement and disbursement responsibilities between MOH and MOFE; and (d) the
lack of experience of MOH senior managers and staff with respect to Bank procedures.
B.   Achievement of Objectives
8.    The project achieved the objectives of reducing mortality and morbidity in the Batinah region
(para. 9) and of strengthening the health care delivery system. But it only partly achieved the objective
of strengthening Government's health planning and management capacity.
9.    The model basic health care delivery system (BHCDS) was established in North Batinah with
considerable success. The baseline study on health status (Table 7) was never carried out, which made
it difficult to assess objectively mortality and morbidity reduction in the Batinah Region. However, as
BHCDS was estimated to be providing improved health coverage to 81 % of the region's population and
exceeded several appraisal targets (e.g. 94% of relevant population were fully immunized compared
to a target of 90%), it is safely assured that health status improved. Under the third objective, new
health policies were introduced, enabling the MOH to integrate preventive and curative care under a
' Infant mortality rate in 1986 was 103 infant deaths per 1000 live births. No estimates were available for maternal
mortality.



- 3 -
unified chain of command with full decentralization of health care delivery to each region (1990), and
subsequent decentralization to the district (wilayat) level (1992).
10.   The outcome under the second objective was mixed (Table 5). The Financial Planning &
Management Systems (FPMS) Unit and the Statistical Unit of the MOH now provide relevant health
management information and cost accounting information to the system.  The project has also
established cost accounting systems in four major hospitals and the MOH is gradually expanding this
facility to other tertiary and major secondary hospitals. Auditors from the Diwan' of the Sultanate
reviewed the establishment and work of the FPMS Unit and recommended strong governmental support
for the institutionalization of such a system in other ministries. Though the FPMS Unit is functional,
like the other divisions in the planning and management section of the MOH, it remains severely
understaffed (actual staff recruitment was 30% of estimated requirements at appraisal).
11.   Despite significant achievements, the institutional strengthening process could have been
stronger. The major weakness was the inability to ensure adequate technical assistance and key MOH
staff at critical times (mainly related to difficulties in obtaining operational funds - para. 14). Identified
training objectives at the start of the project were only partly achieved (Table 5). This is partially
explained by changes in government policy (pre-service training sub-objectives were not achieved as
development of the main target cadre - assistant nurses - was discontinued) and by an inability to fulfill
the designed fellowship program (25% of fellowships were not used). Conversely, targets for in-
service training (except for management and finance) were exceeded (fourteen fold) as the MOH
decided to make in-service training compulsory for all staff. The duration and curriculum of the
training programs varied significantly from what had been identified at appraisal. Notably, the paucity
of health planning and management courses is particularly significant as this could have long term
implications on sustainability of the system (only a one-day course was offered in this area compared to
five six-day courses which had been identified at appraisal, which in hindsight are themselves
insufficient to achieve the degree of skills upgrading required).
C.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
12.   Implementing the project presented several challenges to the Government and MOH. The Staff
Appraisal Report identified as a major risk MOH's capacity to meet the demands arising from the
project in terms of management development, reorganization and expansion of the system to include
new units/sections.
13.   The appraisal team emphasized the need for MOH staff to participate fully in the preparation
and appraisal of the project to minimize the above risk. Although an MOH Task Force was formed,
the MOH decided to rely mainly on external technical assistance (UNDP, WHO, ODA-UK and Bank
inputs ) for project preparation.
14.   The appraisal of the project was too optimistic in terns of potential output achievable within the
projected time horizon. After an extremely slow start, project implementation gained momentum in
mid-1990 as a result of staff changes in project management (a project director replaced the project
coordinator). The main reasons for the slow implementation initially were:
- a delay in deciding the type of facility designs by the MOH thus postponing the
commencement of civil works for three years;
'Council of Ministers. Highest authority under the authority of H.M. The Sultan.



- 4 -
- problems in recruiting technical assistance resulting in slow placement of consultants
for the institutional strengthening process;
- recurring difficulties in obtaining counterpart funds from MOFE for annual
work programs;
- limited managerial capacity of MOE;
- a slow start-up of the fellowship and training programs; and
- the government's evolving health policy which impacted on the project.
15.   The initial lag period of three years (1987-1990) was adequately redressed between 1990 to the
end of implementation in 1994. This was primarily due to: (a) enhanced leadership and decision-
making at the ministerial level including addressing constraints on TA, fellowship and training, and
decisive action on civil works execution; (b) improved Government commitment; (c) better project
management; and (d) strong motivation of health sector personnel.
16.   Project Costs and Financing. The actual costs of the completed project were US$26.0 million
compared with the appraisal estimate of US$30.6 million (see Table 8A). Civil works were higher than
estimated (US$8.8 million disbursed vs. US$6.7 million appraised), mainly due to design changes (two
polyclinics, one hospital and three health centers were built instead of ten health centers which were
planned) and increases in construction costs. The higher costs were, however, mainly covered by
additional Government funds. Less equipment, furniture, vehicles and materials were needed than had
been identified at appraisal because fewer facilities were built (US$3.9 million disbursed vs. US$4.9
million appraised). Allocations for technical assistance and fellowships were also not fully utilized
(US$3.1 million disbursed vs. US$4.9 million appraised) while virtually nothing was spent on local
training and seminars (zero percent of loan allocation for this component was disbursed).
17.   With regard to the Bank loan, less than sixty percent of the Bank loan was disbursed (Table
8a). In addition to previously identified implementation problems (para. 14), the shortfall in the use of
the Bank loan was mainly due to: (a) reduction in equipment, vehicles and materials required (US$2.0
million disbursed vs. US$4.5 million appraised); and (b) problems with disbursement (MOH was
unable to provide MOFE with critical information for certain withdrawal applications').
D.    Project Sustainability
18.   The project achieved its objectives of establishing a sustainable basic health care system in the
regions, improving the health status of the target population and establishing planning and management
institutions within MOH. The Sultanate's economic growth has been a potent factor in this context.
19.   Oman is highly committed to the provision of quality health services. This is supported by the
development strategy conceived by the Ministries of Development, Finance and Economy, and Health.
All the elements of the Health Project are integral parts of the health program in the Fourth Five-Year
Development Plan (1991-1995). The outline for the Fifth Five-Year Development strategy includes all
' For example, MOH was unable to disaggregate drug costs for project facilities from bulk government procurement
or to provide required information on local training.



- 5 -
the project elements and addresses four main areas: infrastructure development, health services, human
resources planning and development, and research (Appendix B: Mission's Aide Memoire, paras. 6-8).
20.   Limited  human resource capacity (particularly in management and finance) which was a
problem during implementation needs to be addressed in the medium to long term to ensure that health
gains are sustained. While budgetary health allocations to MOH to date have been adequate to finance
health services, it would be prudent to reassess health sector costs and financing in view of rising costs
of care (one of the project studies not carried out), increasing patient demands for high-quality care,
growing population and possible economic shocks in an oil-dependent economy.
E.    Bank Performance
21.   The Bank participated in the design and preparation of the project. In spite of the existence of
the MOH Task Force during project preparation, delay over facility design (para. 14) during
implementation suggests that full participation was not achieved. This was responsible to a great extent
for the three-year delay in commencement of civil works. The appraisal mission should have ensured
complete agreement on architectural designs to minimize delays in project implementation. The
appraisal mission identified but underestimnated the risk of limited capacity in the ministry.  In
retrospect, it was unrealistic to assume that the MOH would have been solely responsible for
management (SAR, para. 5.06). Greater clarification between the role of MOH and MOFE should
have been sought by preparation and appraisal missions (para. 23). Eleven supervision missions,
including a disbursement mission, visited Oman between December 1988 and January 1994 to
supervise the project (Table 13). These missions provided constructive advice (however, problems
related to project funding between MOH and MOFE remained in spite of interventions by supervision
missions and Bank management) and were responsive to issues arising during project execution. In
conclusion, while identification and supervision of the project were satisfactory, preparation and
particularly appraisal of the project were less than satisfactory.
F.    Borrower Performance
22.   This was MOH's first experience with a Bank-assisted project.  During the period under
review, MOH's technical capability was mainly limited to the few staff at senior management level.
Despite initial shortcomings (para. 14), MOH's overall perfornance was satisfactory. It received
considerable support and direction from MOFE and the Development Council (now the Ministry of
Development) in terms of government policies relating to Bank-Borrower relationships. The Borrower
cooperated fully with the Bank and maintained regular communication throughout.
23.   The proposed management of funds (SAR 5.06) was not in line with government policy. The
project called for management of funds by the MOH, although MOFE had this mandate'. MOH staff
were not trained in Bank procedures and experienced considerable difficulty providing MOFE required
information (para. 17), particularly for preparing loan disbursements. The advice of a 1990 Bank
disbursement mission that MOH staff be provided with the authority and training to prepare
disbursement and procurement documents was not followed. Legal covenants were substantially
complied with (except those related to the two studies that were not completed); accounts were audited
annually; program budget, work plans and progress reports were regularly submitted annually to the
Bank for review and were found to be of acceptable quality.
' In 1990, a disbursement mission noted that withdrawal applications for all five active World bank loans were
prepared and submitted by MOFE.

G.  Assessment of Outcome
24.   The Basic Health Services Delivery System is fully operational in North Batinah region and its
replication has already begun in other regions. The major objectives of the project were achieved
(paras. 9-11), to a large extent and are likely to be sustained.
25.   The outcome for completion of civil works and infrastructure was satisfactory. The facilities
built comprise three polyclinics, one district (wilayat) hospital and three health centers. The location is
satisfactory and the physical attributes of the completed facilities are generally excellent. All facilities
are fully operational in terms of staff, drugs, vehicles, equipment and services. Most appraisal service
targets were met (SAR, para. 3.03)1. The project facilities provided 45% of health centers and 20% of
secondary hospital coverage in the North Batinah region. Family planning services (birth spacing) is
now being provided by the health centers.
26.   The outcome  in terms of institutional development and  strengthening is mixed. A new
Financial, Planning and Management Section (FPMS) was established while the Statistical Unit was
upgraded to a Health Information Section (HIS). However staffmg levels of both sections are less than
50% of the estimated levels at appraisal. The lack of in-service training programs in planning and
management can only worsen the outlook for continued development of these sections.
H.    Future Operation
27.   The completion of the project coincides with the end of the Fourth Five-Year Development
Plan, 1991-1995. The plan for the operational phase of the project components which are now integral
parts of the MOH system are incorporated into the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan, 1996-2000.
28.   The Sultanate of Oman has graduated from being a borrower. However, the MOH informally
advised the ICR mission of its wish to develop a technical assistance relationship with the Bank. Areas
that MOH may wish to explore include: (a) human resource planning and development (particularly in
management and finance); (b) strengthening of the delivery system at the secondary and tertiary levels;
(c) quality of services; and (d) a review of health costs and financing.
I.   Key Lessons Learned
29.   It is necessary to pay close attention to the roles of the relevant ministries, in this case MOH
and MOFE, in implementation.  The existing institutional arrangements and structure and the
absorptive capacity of the Borrower and sector ministry must be assessed in detail with regard to
implementation mechanisms and project management arrangements. In particular, the division of
responsibilities between the MOFE and MOH for project management and financing, the managerial
capacity of the MOH as well as the Borrower's administrative, budgetary and procurement systems
should have been fully assessed. The result of this assessment should have been reflected in the
implementation arrangements.
30.   In hindsight it would also have been useful to do an explicit stakeholder analysis. The Bank
might then have taken into account better the division of responsibility between the MOH and the
'In addition to immunization (see para. 9), outreach and antenatal care targets were exceeded - 55% vs. 50%, 97%
vs. 90% respectively.

MOFE in designing the managerial and administrative arrangements proposed for the project. This
would have ensured a better involvement of all the stakeholders in project design and preparation.
31.   Architectural designs for the clinics should have been agreed during appraisal and confirmed
during negotiations.
32.   The Bank should have been more insistent that the baseline survey be carried out as this was
central to the monitoring and evaluation system.
33.   For the future the MOH should focus on continued strengthening of its human resources, and
might consider carrying out a review of health costs and financing and deepen health systems analysis.

2Six new health project facilities are located in 4 out of the 6 wilayats (districts) in North Batinah with a total catchment
population of 233,650 or 81% of the total regional population. The following are the 4 wilayats:
-       Sohar               68,100
-       Suwaiq              68,550

Total               233,650
Beneficiaries are women of child bearing years (WCBY) aged 15-45 years and children 0-14 years. Mostly these form
roughly 60-66% of total population in developing countries. In N. Batinah, the beneficiaries are around 58% of the
population.
The project facilities are located with a catchment population that is 81% of the total regional population. Thus potential
project beneficiaries would be 81% of the total WCBY and children (0-14 years) population.

APPENDIX B
THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
HEALTH PROJECT
(LOAN 2807-OMA)
Implementation Completion Mission (April 03-12, 1995!
AideMemoire
A. Introduction
1.    A World Bank Mission from the Human Resources Division (MN2HR) of the Middle East &
North Africa Region, consisting of Dr. Edward Pratt, visited the Sultanate of Oman from April 03
through April 12, 1995 to review and collate information for preparation of the implementation
completion report (ICR) of the above-cited project. The loan was closed as of October 13, 1994 (the
original closing date of the loan was May 31, 1994). At the request of the Ministry of Finance &
Economy (MOFE)l Bank had approved the extension of the closing date by eleven months to enable the
Ministry of Health (MOH) to complete remaining activities pertaining to fellowships, training and
technical assistance. The MOH, however, had advised that it did not consider the extension warranted
as all project components were reasonably established. MOFE requested cancellation of unspent funds
and the loan was accordingly closed after the final disbursement on October 13, 1994.  The
undisbursed balance of the loan account, amounting to $ 5,412,092.54 (59.3%) was canceled as of
December 20, 1994; this was the formal date of notice of cancellation to the Bank. A full refund of the
unutilized balance of the Special Account was made on February 22, 1995.
2.     The mission thanks the MOFE and MOH staff for the support, cooperation and courtesies
extended to it during the pursuance of its work. The mission interviewed relevant officials of the
MOFE and MOH, and reviewed, with relevant component areas, MOH's end of project evaluation
report that had previously been submitted to the Bank. The mission's outcome was reviewed at a wrap-
up meeting with the Project Director, MOH, as well as, with the Director of Loans, MOFE. A
briefing meeting followed with H.E. The Undersecretary for Planning Affairs, Ministry of Health.

B.    Project Components & Objectives
Project Components
A. Health Services Development:
-   Establishing Basic Health Care Delivery System (BHCDS) in North Batinah Region
-   Establishing Regional Training
-   Strengthening Health Promotion
B. Strengthening Ministry of Health's (MOH) Planning and Management capability
C. Project Management
Project Objectives
(i)    To reduce mortality and morbidity, particularly in the predominantly rural Batinah
region;
(ii)   To develop the MOH's institutional capability to plan and manage the health sector;
(iii)   To support the institution building processes necessary for the country-wide
implementation of a more efficient and integrated health care delivery system.
C.    Project Status
3.    With the closing date of the project having come into effect, all components of the project have
been firmly established as follows:
I. Health Services Development: Health services have been developed under the project in the
North Batinah region in terms of an effective basic health care delivery system which is fully
integrated, fully operational and proving effective in terms of improving the health status of the
population; relevant vital and demographic supporting data will be provided in the ICR. It has
served as a model that is being replicated in other regions of the Sultanate. A major achievement
is the regional decentralization of the management, administration, planning and implementation
of health services delivery. However, certain fundamental constraints to effective management
are present involving quantitative and qualitative aspects of capacity building, as well as, a clear
definition of management relationships between central MOH and its regional counterparts. This
will be amplified in the ICR.
II. Institutional Strengthening of the MQH: The various component areas in MOH requiring
institutional strengthening have been established and are still engaged in the processes of
improving all-around analytical, planning and management capability of the MOH. The key
areas are: Health Information System, Financial Planning & Management, Health Services &
Manpower (Human Resources) Planning, and Health Promotion. To a reasonable degree this
has been achieved although consolidation of institutional inputs, particularly in the area of
capacity building, requires further attention to ensure efficiency and quality assurance. There is
therefore the need for the MOH to develop a plan for continued operationalizing of the programs
evolving from the project; however, MOH considers it impractical to provide the mission with a



- 24 -
matrix for an operational plan at this time (Para. 10 below refers). The phase of institutional
development is at a dynamic stage whereby the expected goal of sector efficiency, effectiveness
and financing is yet to be fully realized. The determinants for sustainability have been reviewed
and will be elaborated upon in the ICR.
D. Project Financing
4.    There are no further disbursements from the proceeds of the loan and remaining funds that are
unutilized have been duly canceled (para. 1 above, refers). This does not, in effect, discharge the
Government of Oman from its obligations towards ensuring the viability and sustainability of programs,
activities and elements of the project which now form an integral part of the health system.

E.    MOH End Of Project implementation Report
5.    The mission undertook a review, with relevant project implementation officials, of the end of
project implementation report submitted by MOH/MOFE to the Bank prior to the ICR mission.
Performance indicators to monitor implementation were confirmed and the report provided a
reasonable documentation of achievements of project objectives. Borrower's commitment to project
objectives was reaffirmed at the executing and implementing levels. Under these terms, the report was
precise. The report, however, did not carry analytical information relating to economic, financial,
social and environmental conditions in which the project was implemented. The mission elicited some
of this information during the review.  MOFE considered the end of project report submitted
incomplete as it did not include its assessment of project financing and Borrower-Bank performance;
this will now be added by MOFE to that report. The mission further noted that key "lessons learned"
form a significant part of implementation completion evaluation both for the Borrower and Bank; this
was absent in the MOH report but the mission received some feedback in this area that will be reflected
in the ICR.
Operational Action Plan
6.    The completion of the project coincides with the end of the Fourth FIVE-YEAR Development
Plan (4FYDP), 1991-1995. The plan for the operational phase of the project components which are
now integral parts of the MOH system will be dependent on the Fifth five Year Development Plan
(5FYDP), 1996-2000, which is in the process of preparation. It will incorporate the components of the
Health Project carried in the 4FYDP. The 5FYDP is being developed on the basis of monitoring and
evaluation of the 4FYDP through a workshop to be held during April 1995; the Plan is expected to be
ready sometime in 1996.
7.    Four main areas will be addressed: health facilities (infrastructure development); health
services/programs (in terms of improving efficiency, effectiveness and quality which may involve
integration, consolidation, rationalization, and the continued strengthening of management information
systems); manpower (human resources) planning and development involving basic and post-basic
training and specialization, tailored to the assessed needs for sector development, for health, nursing
and auxiliary cadres included will be improved curriculum for public health and health education;
health systems and epidemiology research.
8.    MOH assures the mission that the Plan will take into account the requirements for sustainability
in terms of capacity building and health financing outlays (provision of capital and recurrent budgets).
The mission feels that this particular element is partly dependent on the Government of Oman's
resource mobilization and adjustments in the economy, and partly to MOH's planning efficiency.

The project as a whole has been successfully implemented with some
changes in the Ministry of Health priorities. The undrawn balance was
mainly contributed by saving achieved due to the bulk procurements and
also by the changes of priorities in implementing the project.
10. Bank Mission
The Bank missions  have maintained high level of technical assistance
throughout the period of the project in its impelemention. The missions
close coordination and follow-up during the progress of the project assisted
the concerned Ministries in the completion of the project as well as on the
utilization of the loan funds.
This close relation by the Bank missions & the Bank assistance as a whole
will continue to be valued with appreciation.
