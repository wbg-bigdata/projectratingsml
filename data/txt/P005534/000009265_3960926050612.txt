MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
FOR A HEALTH PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Sultanate of Oman
for US$13.3 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
vould carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 15 years,
including 3 years of grace and would help finance a health project.
2.        BacSground.  Oman's development as a modern state, based almost
entirely on oil revenues, began from a very low base only 16 years ago.
Despite progress in the capital city of Muscat, living conditions, health,
nutritional and educational status of the population are still poor, close
to those of low-income countries. Government policy of providing free
health care to the Omani population has been implemented by the Ministry of
Health (NOH) through construction of an extensive, hospital-based, curative-
oriented health infrastructure operated by expatriate manpower. Current
Government policy is to diversify the oil-dependent economy, promote wider
and more cost-effective distribution of health services and encourage human
resource development, especially development of skilled manpower, with the
specific goal of replacing foreign workers with trained Omanis. The
Government also regards the Bank project as a means of strengthening the
institutional capacity of MOR for formulating policy, preparing and
implementing projects, and taking cost-effectiveness and financial
constrair'.s into consideration. With the sharp decline in oil prices in
1986, the Government was obliged to reduce its investment targets for the
Third Five-Year Development Plan (1986-90). During appraisal, the Bank and
the Government agreed on reducing project costs in an effort to remain
within the revised investment targets.
3.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would: (a) reduce
mortality and morbidity, particularly of 300,000 inhabitants of the
predominantly rural Batinah region; (b) strengthen Government's
institutional capacity to plan and manage the health sector; and (c) prepare
the way for the country-wide implementation of a more efficient service
delivery model.
4.        Proiect Description.  Part A:  Health Services Develogment.  The
proposed project would assist the MOB to implement a basic health care
delivery system (BHCDS) which integrates curative and preventive care and
health promotion. It would help MOH to: (a) establish BECDS in Batinah as
the first phase of its nation-wide implementation through: establishing a
new Regional Health Office; completing the network of BBC facilities; and
supporting outreach activities; (b) strengthen regional training by
supporting the establishment of pre-service and in-service training programs
in Batinah and other regions; and (c) strengthen health promotion by
supporting nation-wide health education activities through the Realth
Education Section of NOR. Part B: Strenfthening MOH's Health Sector
Planning and Manamement Capability. The proposed project vould assist the
MOa in improving sector efficiency, effectiveness, and financing, by
strengthening the MOE's analytical, planning and management capability. The



project would support on institution-building process focused on improving
mauagement information systems in healtb and finance; improving financial
planning and management; and developing health services and manpower
planning. The project would help MOE to establish: (a) a new Health
Information Sectiou and a new Health Services and Manpower Planning Section
within the Directorate of Statistics, Planning end Follow-up; and (b) a new
Fi_ancial Planning and Management Section within the Directorate of Finance.
The project will be carried out over five years and would provide funds for
civil works, equipment, furniture, vehicles, materials, drugs and supplies;
technical assistance, fellowships and training, and incremental operatin.,
costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated at US$30.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$13.3 million (44Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Oman are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6544-OK, dated April 15, 1987 is being distributed
separately.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project forms an integral
part of Bank's strategy for Oman which emphasizes assistance in two crucial
areas: (a) relief of national manpower constraints; and (b) development of
appropriate policies and investment strategies in priority sectors. Within
this strategy, the project responds to Government's sector policy of
reorienting sector development away from the initial focus on hospital-based
curative services by supporting the introduction of the BHCDS as a cost-
effective means of providing the population health care. To implement this
reorientation, the Ministry of Health needs to improve its planning and
management institutional capacity and to reduce dependence on expatriate
labor. Through the creation of a planning unit, the strengthening of the
bealth and financial management information systems and the development of a
training program the NOR would be provided with the institutional capability
for implementing the first phase of the BHCDS during the project and
replicating it nationally durirg the next Five Year Development Plan (1991-
1995).
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the folloving
actions as conditions of loan effectiveness: (a) appointment of a Project
Coordinator, a Deputy Project Coordinator and a Regional Health Officer in
Batinah; (b) selection of three key staff for the Regional Realth Office in
Batinah; (c) establishment of the project Advisory Committee; and
(d) submission to the Bank of proof of acquisition of sites, final                      A
contruction dravings and bidding documents for all civil works. Other major
actions agreed to be taken during Project implementation include:
(a) establishment/upgrading of the Health Services and Manpower Planning,
Health Information, Financial Planning and Management and Health Education
sections of MOB and submission of progress report on this matter by November
30, 1987; (b) completion of programs and curricula for training of assistant
and registered nurses by December 31, 1988, and initiation of training in
September, 1989; (c) completion of a study on alternatives for sector



-3-
financing including cost-recovery by October 31, 1989, and implementation of
cost recovery measures by January 1990. (d) completion of a plan for the
natioA-vide implementation of the BRCDS by March 31, 1990; and (e)
completion of a mid-project evaluation by December 31, 1990.
7.        Justification.  The project would: (a) reduce mortality and
morbidity, particularly among poor people in rural areas, and infants,
children and women of childbearing age as a result of expanded health
services coverage and intensified health promotion activities; (b) ease the
demands of the health sector for public resources as a result of greater
efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery, improved investment
planning and use of resources for operation, and the introduction of cost
containment and cost recovery measures; and (c) reduce dependence on
expatriate labor through the establishment of training programs. In
addition, the project would develop MOR's institutional capacity to expand
the cost-effective BRCDS throughout Oman.
8.        Risks.  The Government has made a firm commitment to provide
adequate budgetary resources and all project components are included in the
MOB budget under the Third Five Year Plan (1986-90). The principal risk
relates to the fact that the reorganization and expansion of health services
would, at least in the initial phase, make for considerable demands ou the
management skills and adaptability of MNE staff, and call for a sustained
commitment on their part. However, participation in project preparation and
appraisal has given NOR staff an understanding of the project's potential
for achieving the country's health objectives in the most cost-effective
way. Moreover, the high priority of the project's health objectives and the
understanding of the project's potential for improving efficiency and
effectiveness in the sector together with the impact of the project's
institution-building and training components should deepen this
understanding and increase MOE capability to implement it. The project
provides for the establishment of a strong regional management for the new
basic health care delivery system and for its monitoring.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
