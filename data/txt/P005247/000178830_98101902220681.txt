INTERNATIO.NAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDKN
FOR THE NORTHEAST GHOR IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        i submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed cre-
dit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the equivalent of US$7.5 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance the Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural
Development Project. The borrower would relend about $760,000 equivalent
througyh the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC) to the Agricultural Credit Cor-
poration (ACC) for 15 years with interest at no less than 4-1/4 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Jordan" was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 18, 1972 (R72-
231). An economic mission visited Jordan in January 1974 and its report is
under preparation. Country data sheets are attached as Annex 3].
3.        During 1962-1966, the Jordanian economy grew at over 8 percent per
year in real terms. Price stability prevailed, and high levels of foreign
assistance permitted a sustained surplus in the balance of payments. However,
Jordan's economy was adversely affected by the 1967 war with Israel and the
confrontation with the Palestinian Fedayeen groups in 1970/71. The occupation
of the West Bank, which supported 30 percent of Jordan's population, deprived
the country of about 35-45 percent of its GNP, and over 300,000 refugees emi-
grated to the East Bank. Growth of the most promising sectors, agriculture,
tourism and industry, was curtailed; military expenditures increased; and
the economy became more dependent on foreign budgetary support and military
aid. The latter accounted for almost one-fifth of GNP in 1973. Government's
efforts to check the activity of Palestinian guerillas in 1970/71 provoked
economic sanctions against Jordan by some Arab countries. The closure of
the Jordanian-Syrian border from July 1971 to November 1972 cut the country's
land communications with Europe and resulted in a decrease in exports from
$41 million in 1969 to $32 million in 1971. Difficulties were compounded
by the suspension of budget support from Kuwait and Libya after 1970, and
the closure of the Syrian-Lebanese frontier during the first half of 1973.
4.        Now, thanks to more settled domestic conditions, economic recovery
is well underway. In the second half of 1971, agricultural output increased.
Industry picked up in 1972 and reached high capacity utilization in 1973.
Exports of phosphates, cement and other commodities rose sharply, from $32
million in 1971 to $53 million in 1973. The increase of imports was also
large, but increased receipts for foreign travel, workers' remittances,
foreign budget support and direct military aid more than compensated for
the deterioration in the trade account. At the end of 1973, the surplus



of the balance of payment amounted to $38 million and gross official re-
serves reached $312 million, equivalent to nine months cf imports of goods
and services.  A high level of construction activity and workers' temporary
migration relieved unemployment, now estinrated at about 8 percent.   The Octo-
ber 1973 conflict did not affect Jordan's economy significantly and available
indicators point to a sharp increase in private industrial investment under a
new incentives law. Public investment also is likely to pick up considerably
with the start of a number of projects and economic growth is likely to be
rapid in 1974, thanks also to the recovery of agricultural production from a
bad crop in 1973. With the reopening of the Syrian frontiers with both
Lebanon and Jordan in mid-1973, a calm domestic potitical climate, and a
revival of private investment, prospects for continued growth are good. In
spite of the vulnerability to increases in world prices, since imports are
equivalent to more than 50 percent of GNP, balance of payments prospects are
satisfactory, because of the recent tripling of phosphate prices and an ex-
pected increase in phosphates production.
5.        An overall Middle East settlement would enhance longer term pros-
Dects of uninterrupted growth. Nevertheless, Jordarn's development will corh-
tinue to face the difficult problems of limited natural resources, a rapidly
growing population and the pressing need to create new jobs to absorb the
growing labor force, reduce the serious inderemployment, and settle refugees.
Besides phosphate deposits, the country has yet unexploited deposits of potash
and copper ore. The largest productive sector, agriculture, has growth poten-
tial through irrigation and technical improvements, in spite of limited land
and water resources. The country has also a potential for small- and medium-
scale manufacturing which can be developed through an active search for viable
projects, removal of the remaining bottlenecks for the private sector, insti-
tutional backing, and improvement of skills in management.
6.        The Government has prepared a three-year Development Plan (1973-75)
to step up private and public investment to $557 million over 1973-75, which
would be an increase of 70 percent ove. the level of the depressed 1969-71
period. The Plan offers an adequate balance between economic growth, income
distribution, institution building and employment objectives. Transport ac-
counts for 20 percent of total investment; mining, power and industry 20 per-
cent; construction 20 percent; agriculture 15 percent; social sectors 17 per-
cent; communications, tourism and trade 8 percent. The bulk of transport in-
vEstments are for railroad construction to enable an increase in exports of
phosphate rock. Special emphasis is placed on providing non-subsidized, low-
cost housing which is urgently needed in the cities, especially Amman. The
most important projects in industry and mining have as their objectives the
increase of phosphate mining from I million tons to 2.7 million tons, and a
beginning of phosphate processing. In agriculture, the major allocations
are for irrigation in the Jordan valley and in the Dead Sea region. Progress
on institutional reforms and project preparation was substantial during the
first year of the Plan, and has opened the way to project implementation
during the following years.
7.        Fifty-six percent (i.e. $310 million) of total Plan investment is
to be carried out by the public sector, with 70 percent (substantially more
than in the past) being financed by foreign sources, half in loans and half



- 3 -
in grants. The government budget would provide about $75 million annually
during 1973-1975 for public investment and would increase domestic borrowing
to nearly $50 million a year, mainly through development bonds and treasury
bills.
8.        The pattern of external assistance to Jordan in the recent past has
largely been influenced by the unsettled conditions of the region. Transfers
to the Government, mostly in the form of budgetary support and military aid,
averaged $140 million per year during 1967-73. Under the Khartoum Agreement,
Jordan received subsidies amounting to about $105 million annually from Kuwait,
Libya and Saudi Arabia in 1967-69. Saudi Arabia maintained financial assis-
tance in 1970 and increased its aid from $40 million to $64 million in 1972.
Substantial US transfers ($100 million in 1972 and $89 million in 1973) com-
pensated for the suspension after 1970 of the payments from Kuwait and Libya;
Kuwait resumed its support in April 1973, raising total official transfers
received by Jordan to $179 million in that year.
9.        The new emphasis on development and an extensive project list pre-
sented in the Plan have led to a sharp increase in development aid. New com-
mitments over the last two years amounted to $137 million, mostly from Western
sources, Kuwait and IDA. Average terms on the $92 million committed in 1973
were 1.1 percent interest, 6.9 years of grace and 29.7 years maturity. The
net inflow of long and medium-term capital to the central and local govern-
ments, which had averaged $10 million per year during 1967-70, increased
sharply to an average of more than $30 million annually after 1970. The
external public debt, including undisbursed amounts, was about $221 million
at the end of 1972, of which only about 10 percent was held by the Bank Group.
Because of the concessional terms, the debt service ratio did not exceed 6.6
percent in 1973. However, Jordan must continue to look for external lenders
for concessional aid and for the financing of a high share of project costs,
including some local currency financing, because of the difficult development
problems arising from the country's limited natural resources, serious under-
employment problem and the refugee burden.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       Jordan has to date received eight IDA credits, amounting to $40.3
million, net of cancellations. Performance under all projects has been gen-
erally satisfactory. Four credits were made before 1967--two for agricultural
credit (6.0 million) and two for water supply ($4.0 million)--and are fully
disbursed. After the 1967 war and the 1970 civil disturbances, Bank Group
lending resumed in mid-1971 and credits were made for highways ($6 million),
education ($5.4 million), power ($10.2 million) and water supply ($8.7 mil-
lion. The Bank is acting as Executing Agency for a three-year UNDP Planning
Assistance Project in the National Planning Council which includes project
generation, aid coordination and training of Jordanians in project prepara-
tion. IFC has made its first investment in Jordan in February 1974 consist-
ing of a $224,000 equity participation and $1,600,000 loan to Jordan Ceramic
Industries Company Limited (JCL). Annex II contains a summary statement of



- 4 -
IDA credits and the IFC investment as of' March 31, 1974, and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
11.       The Bank Group's role in the medium term is to assist in institu-
tions building and in project identification, preparation and financing in
the sectors which offer the best growth prospects and employment opportuni-
ties, such as irrigated agriculture and rural development, light industry
and tourism. Priority will also be given to the expansion and reinforcement
of vocational and technical education, to produce the specialized skills re-
quired for the development of the above sectors, and to water supply, trans-
portation and electric power to provide the necessary infrastructure. While,
in view of Jordan's poverty and limited debt servicing capacity, IDA would
normally have to be the source of Bank Group assistance, IBRD lending for
prospective large mining projects may be considered on an "enclave" basis
in view of their net contribution to the country's trade balance.
12.       For the near future, a second education project is currently being
appraised; a combined urban development/highway project and a first DFC proj-
ect are also being considered. The Bank Group is assisting the development
of light industry and tourism by supervising the execution of a study for
the development of Aqaba, financed as part of our recent water supply credit.
A 1966 study for the extraction of potash from the Dead Sea is being updated
by the Government and a project may be proposed for Bank Group financing.
IFC is discussing with the Government a large scale project for phosphate
based fertilizers.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN JORDAN
13.       Agriculture accounts for one-fifth of GDP in East Jordan and is the
largest productive sector in the economy. It provides the main source of live-
lihood for one-third of the labor force and a third of export earnings. The
principal agricultural exports are tomatoes and citrus. Domestic production,
however, is insufficient to meet the country's needs of food. Wheat, rice,
meat, dairy products, fruit and vegetables have to be imported. The trade
deficit in agricultural commodities is substantial, currently above $62 mil-
lion a year.
14.       The Government's agricultural development strategy aims at increas-
ing output by rehabilitating and expanding irrigation, increasing land produc-
tivity, reclaiming land, improving marketing and introducing high quality
varieties of crops. The plan aims at narrowing the deficit in the trade
balance by increasing the value of exports from $14 million in 1971 to $26
million in 1975 and by increasing substitution for imports of agricultural
commodities.
15.       There is some scope to increase agricultural production by increas-
ing the use of Jordan's land and water resources. Out of the country's 350,000
ha cultivated area, more than 90% of the cultivated land is dependent on limited
and irregular rainfall. While there is little possibility of expanding the



- 5 -
area which can be cultivated under rainfed conditions, expansion of irrigated
agriculture in the Jordan Valley offers opportunities of increasing production.
Most of the country's 25,000 ha of irrigated land, which accounts for 70% of
total agricultural production, lies In the Jordan Valley. In order to accel-
erate agricultural development in the Valley, the Government set up in 1972
the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC) with wide administrative and executive
powers. As a starting point, the Commission prepared a Three-Year Develop-
ment Plan (1973-75) within the framework of the National Development Plan.
The Plan emphasizes water devclopment and the proposed project figures in
it prominently.
PART IV - THE PROJECr
16.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Northeast Chor Irrigation and Rural
Development Project - Jordan (No. 339-JO dated May 10, 1974) is being dis-
tributed separately to the Executive Directors. A Credit and Project Summary
is attached as Annex III. A map of the project area is also attached. Tech-
nical feasibility studies for the development of the Jordan Valley were pre-
pared in 1969 by the consultants NEDECO (Netherlands) and Dar El Handasah
(Lebanon). Additional studies were made by JVC. A FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program mission visited Jordan in February 1973 to assist in the preparation
of the project. The project was appraised in October 1973. Negotiations for
the proposed credit were held in Washington in March 1974. The Government
delegation was led by Mr. Omar Abdullah Dokhgan, President of the Jordan
Valley Commission.
17.       The proposed project is part of a comprehensive agricultural devel-
opment scheme for the entire Jordan Valley (East Bank), which aims at develop-
ing irrigation and providing rural development facilities to increase produc-
tion and narrow income distribution disparities. Within this overall scheme,
USAID is assisting agricultural development in the Central part of the valley
and with improvements of main roads generally; the Kuwait Fund is assisting
with the construction of a dam on the Zarka tributary in the Central valley;
and the German Federal Republic is assisting, through Kreditaustalt fur
Wideraufbau, valleywide electrification and telecommunications projects
as well as irrigation in the southern part of the valley.
18.       The proposed project would almost double agricultural production
over an area of 7,700 ha through land leveling, more efficient water dis-
tribution and drainage on 4,940 ha that are already irrigated, conversion
from gravity irrigation to sprinkler irrigation on 1,720 ha and provision
of sprinkler irrigation for 1,040 ha, presently rainfed. Main project works
include two diversion weirs and siltation reservoirs; 55 km of primary and
secondary pipelines and a distribution network for sprinkler irrigation;
30 km of farm roads; land leveling of about 3,000 ha; tile drainage of
about 520 ha; rehabilitation works on the existing East Ghor Canal; and
2 marketing centers. The project also includes treated water supply systems
for about 10 villages; three new health centers and extension of an existing
center; about 150 classrooms; a vocational training center; improvement of



- 6 -
about 60 km of roads; about 10 communitY development centers; and $2.7 million
credit to the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) to finance the agricultural
credit requirements in the project area for mobile sprinkler equipment, other
farm machinery and inputs.
19.       Expansion of agricultural production for domestic consumption and
exports would bring about a significant increase in farm incomes, presently
about JD 95 ($295) per capita, and significant improvements in the living
standards of project area residents. The project aims at doubling the net
income on vegetable farms and at increasing by 30-40% the net income on
mixed produce farms. Direct employment would increase from the present
1.3 million man-days to 2.3 million at full development.
Interest of the riparians
20.       Part of the water for the proposed project would come from the
Yarmouk River, an international waterway which forms a boundary between
Jordan and Syria (including some of its occupied territories) and then flows
into the Jordan River at the northern boundary between Jordan and Israel
near Lake Tiberias. Water for the project is assured by an international
treaty between Jordan and Syria signed in June 1953 which specifies how the
waters of the Yarmouk and its tributaries are to be shared. Israel presently
draws a small amount of water from the Yarmouk (about one cubic meter per
second) for irrigation. The project is not harmful to the interests of
other riparians since improved irrigation efficiency with the project would
permit saving about 40 percent of the water presently used in the project
area.
Land Tenure and Farm Size
21.       A law passed in 1968 requires that landholdings in government-
developed irrigation areas should be allocated in-holdings of 3 ha where
land is highly productive, or 5 ha where land productivity is average. This
law also limits to 20 ha the maximum size of the holdings of previous owners.
A survey carried out in February/March 1973 indicates that about 85% of hold-
ings in the project area are within the range of 3 to 6 ha. About 40% of
tihe project area is owner-operated and 60% sharecropped or rented to tenants.
The newly irrigated area of the project has been acquired and will be reallo-
cated to comply withl existing Jordanian. Law. The National Resources Authority
(NKA) has the legal and administrative machinery for land acquisition and re-
allocation.
Project Execution
22.       The project is to be carried out in 1974-78 under the overall re-
sponsibility of the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC). JVC was established in
1973 as a public entity with the sole responsibility for the economic and so-
cial development of the Jordan Valley.   Headed by a President/Director Gen-
eral and who reports directly tc the Prime Minister, JVC has adequate admin-
istrative, legal and financial powers for its operations. The staff of JVC
has been recently increased to enable it to carry out its tasks satisfactorily.



- 7 -
23,       JVC would retain specific responsibility for planning, coordination,
supervision and financial control of the project, and would entrust project
execution, including detailed supervision of consultants' and contractors'
work, to the relevant Government agencies. The NRA would be responsible
for irrigation works, water supply facilities and collection of water charges.
The Public Works Department would supervise the construction of primary mar-
kets, health centers, schools, the vocational training center, roads and com-
munity centers. The Department of Agriculture would provide extension and
research services and the training support for the project. The Agricul-
tural Credit Corporation (ACC) would be responsible for providing credit
to the project farmers for mobile sprinkler equipment, other farm machinery
and inputs. The Education and Health Departments would coordinate with JVC
and the Public Works Department during the planning and construction phase
of the schools and health centers, and later would be responsible for operat-
ing these facilities. JVC would also establish a Farmers' Association (FA)
for the whole Valley, which would assist the farmers in obtaining credit,
agricultural inputs and other services, as well as in marketing their pro-
duce. The Agricultural Marketing Organization (AMO) would operate the prim-
ary markets and the packing and grading station. AMO would train professional
staff of the FA. A Liaison and Advisory Committee (LAC) including the senior
representatives of the agencies concerned has been set up under the chairman-
ship of the President of JVC. LAC would meet periodically to assign prior-
ities, coordinate project activitie, among the executing agencies, and re-
solve difficulties.
Consultant Services
24.       JVC is finalizing a contract with the consultants who prepared the
feasibility studies, NEDECO and Dar El Handasah, to assist NRA in the design
and supervision of all irrigation works.
Cost Estimates
25.       Total project cost, excluding import duties and taxes, is estimated
at $17.4 million including $4.9 million for physical and price contingencies.
The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $9.1 million, or 52% of the total
cost. Physical contingencies are estimates at 15% for irrigation works
and 10% for all other items. Contingencies for price escalation of civil
works and equipment have been included, at 12 and 9% in 1974; 10 and 7% in
1975; and 8 and 5% in 1976 through 1978 respectively. Contingencies for
price escalation for land, engineering and administration have been included
at 6.5% annually for foreign costs, and 10% annually for local expenditure.
Financing Plan and Recovery of Costs
26.       The proposed IDA credit would finance 82% of the foreign cost,
equivalent to 43% of the total cost. The balance of the foreign cost and
92% of the local cost would be financed by the Government of Jordan. Proj-
ect farmers would contribute the balance (8%) of local costs, represented
by their share in the financing of sprinkler equipment, farm machinery and
agricultural inputs required for the project. The financing plan would be
as follows:



-8-
US$             % of
million        project cost
!DA credit                                    7.5              43
Government
Foreign exchange cost                    1.6              10
Local currency expenditures              7.6             43
Project farmers                               0.7               4
Total              17.4             100
27.       Water charges of 6 fils*/m    would be levied on the berieficiaries
in order to recover full operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation
system which would serve the project area, and full investment costs charge-
able to the project, including 5 percent interest per year, over the project
lifetime of 40 years. Project charges would amount to about 19% of the in-
cremental income on the average.
20.       The ACC would repay the amount of the project's credit component
over 15 years at an interest rate of not less than 4-1/4%. This would give
ACC a satisfactory margin on its sub-loans to 7roject farmers, which would
bear interest at not less than ACC's prevailing standard terms of 6-8%.
AMO would charge a fee of 1% of the gross value of the produce sold in the
primary markets it operates, and a fee of 5% of the gross value of the produce
packed and graded in its stations. By the early 1980's, the proposed level of
fees would cover full operation and maintenance costs and leave a margin for
AMO.
Procurement
29.       The irrigation works and the main system of rural water supply
($5.5 million) would be grouped into one contract, and awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding under the World Bank's guidelines. Contracts
for equipment and materials exceeding $10,000 each, amounting to about $3.4
million would also be awarded after international competitive bidding under
the World Bank's guidelines.   Domestic suppliers would receive a preference
equivalent to existing import duties or 15 percent of the c.i.f. cost, which-
ever is the lower. Equipment and materials contracts not exceeding $10,000
each and an aggregate amount of $100,000, would be awarded after local com-
petitive bidding in accordance with government procedures. The remaining
project works (construction of schools, health centers, roads etc.) amounting
to about $1.8 million are not suitable for international competitive bidding
because they are scattered and their construction is spread over long periods.
These contracts would be awarded after local competitive bidding in accordance
with normal Government procurement procedures.

Disbursement and Retroactive F:nancing
30.       Disbursement would be made in 1975-79, as shown in Annex III, to
finance 50% of civil works contracts; the CIF cost of directly imported goods
and 80% of total costs of goods purchased from local suppliers; the foreign
exchange costs of consultant services; and 38% of loan disbursements made by
Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) against short-, medium-, and long-term
credit to project farmers for the purchase of mobile sprinkler equipment,
other farm machinery and inputs. The IDA credit would finance retroactively
up to $175,000 of expenditures for consultants' services incurred after March 1,
1974.
Economic Rate of Return and Justification
31.       At full development, the annual gross value of agricultural produc-
tion in the project area would be twice the value expected without project,
mainly due to increased production of high value fruits and vegetables. The
economic rate of return is about 24% besides significant social benefits and
institutional improvements. Furthermore, the project would result in addi-
tional gross foreign exchange earnings valued at $6 million per year, increased
availability of fruits and vegetables for the domestic market, and higher in-
comes and employnment for about 1,700 farm families. The provision of schools,
health centers, water supply facilities, and community centers would also con-
tribute to a significant improvements of the living conditions of small farmers
in the project area and a corresponding reduction of the incentives to urban
migration. After payment of project charges, the net annual farm income per
capita in the project area at 1971-73 average prices would increase by more
than 50 percent to about JD 150 (equivalent to $470).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and JVC, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The enactment of a law establishing the
Jordan Valley Farmers' Association and the election of its Executive Board
would be an additional condition of effectiveness. Otherwise, the draft
Credit and Project Agreements conform to the normal pattern of credits for
irrigation and rural development projects.
