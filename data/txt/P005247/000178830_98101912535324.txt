SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Jordan has an area of 190,000 sq. km and a population of 2.7 mil-
lion, increasing at a rate of 3.3% per year. Its agriculture accounts for
about one-fifth of GDP and is the largest production sector in the economy,
providing one-half of exports and employment for one-third of the labor force.
Despite this, agricultural commodities mainly zereals, meat, fruit and vege-
tables are imported annually to meet the nationi's needs, and the agricultural
trade deficit is currently over US$62 million.
ii.       Irrigation is necessary to increase agricultural production; both
land and water resources are available for its expansion. At present only
25,000 hectares, or less than 10% of the 350,000 hectares cultivated, are
irrigated, but by value their produce accounts for 70% of the agricultural
production. The national Development Plan (1973-75), and within its frame-
work the three year Development Plan for the Jordan Valley, emphasizes the
development of irrigation to increase production, narrow income distribution
margins and provide the rural development facilities. The proposed North-
east Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project would contribute to the
realization of these objectives. The Government of Jordan has requested an
IDA credit to help finance the project.
iii.      Bank Group lending to Jordan since it began in 1961 consists of
8 credits totalling US$40.3 million (net of cancellations); two for agricul-
ture, three for water supply, one for highways, one for education and one for
power. Except for the latest water supply and the power projects, on which
it is too early to report, the implementation of projects and disbursements
have been generally satisfactory.
iv.       The project would develop 7,700 hectares of which about 86% is
already gravity irrigated. The currently unirrigated 14% (1,040 hectares)
together with 1,720 hectares of the currently irrigated area would be pro-
vided with gravity-powered sprinkler irrigation. The project would also
provide facilities in the form of domestic water supply, health, education,
communications and community development to benefit the project population of
25,000 persons. To serve 2,760 ha by sprinkler irrigation, the project works
would include two small diversion weirs, 55 km of primary and secondary pipe-
lines and a distribution network.< To improve production on the existing
gravity irrigated area, the project would provide land leveling of about
3,000 ha and tile drainage of about 520 ha. In addition the project would
include 30 km of farm roads, seasonal and medium-term credits, two assembly
markets and community development facilities consisting of construction of
treated water supply facilities for 10 villages, of three health centers aad
expansion of an existing one, 150 schoolrooms for preparatory and primary
classes, a vocational training center, 10 community centers and improvement
of a 60 km of roads.
v.        The project would be executed by the already established Jordan
Valley Commission (JVC) with the help of relevant government agenci-es. The
irrigation works (43% of project cost) would be constructed with the assist-
ance of the Natural Resources Authority (NRA), the agency responsible for



- ii -
irrigation. A consultant firm would assist JVC and NRA in the design and
construct:,.on supervision of all irrigation works, which would be constructed
under one international contract. Specialist assistance in marketing, grading
and accounting would be provided to ensure efficient marketing of produce.
vi.       Total project cost is estimated at US$17.4 million, of which the
foreign exchange would be US$9.1 nillion (52%). An IDA credit of US$7.5
million would finance 82% of the foreign exchange requirement. Government
would finance the foreign exchange gap of US$1.6 million and 92% of local
costs (US$7.6 million equivalent) either under bilateral assistance arrange-
ments or with its own resources. The remaining 8% of local costs (US$0.66
million), representing 20% of farm development costs, would be contributed
by project farmers. Construction would be started in 1974 and completed by
1978. The cost of the project, excluding contingencies, that cotild be tendered,
would be US$13.5 million, of which works, equipment, supplies and services
costing about US$8.9 million (66%) would be procured following international
competitive bidding. The remaining works, of small magnitude and scattered
over tine and location, would be executed following local competitive bidding.
vii.      At full development in 1983, the project would increase annual pro-
duction of main crops: citrus by 13,000 tons, bananas by 2,500 tons, vegetables
by 69,000 tons and cereals by 7,000 tons. Most of the incremental production
would be domestically consumed; however, some top grades of the early vegetables
and citrus would be exported. At full development by 1983, gross value of an-
nual production would increase from the present US$9.3 million to US$17.4 mil-
lion. Annual gross foreign exchange earnings from the export of a third of
the project's produce are estimated at US$6.0 million. The economic rate of
return for the project is estimated at 24%, At full development the per capita
income of sharecroppers, representing 60% of the farmers, would reach about
; 100 to JD 125 (US$310 to US$390), i.e. slightly above the projected national
per capita income of JD 97 (US$300) in 1983.
viii.     The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$7.5 million
on conventional terms. The borrower will be the Government of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan.



JORDAN
Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the IHashemite Kingdom of Jordan has requested an
IDA credit of US$7.5 million to finance 82% of the foreign exchange cost (in-
cluding physical and price contingencies) of the Northeast Ghor Irrigation
and Rural Development Project. The 1972 Bank economic mission observed that
the Jordanian agricultural sector offers the most productive development
potential and that water and agricultural land remain the most important of
the country's exploitable natural resources to be developed for additional
production, exports and employment. Since there is little possibility of ex-
panding rainfed cultivation, the only expansion possible is by increasing
irrigation of the cultivated lands. The country's three-year development
plan (1973-75) emphasizes the development of water, improvements in infra-
structure and expansion of social service facilities. The proposed project
would involve agricultural and rural development of the northern third of the
Jordan Valley (East bank), while the remaining two-thirds would be developed
with assistance from other donors, mainly the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development, US-AID and the Federal Republic of Germany. It would not only
conform to the objectives of the Plan, but also aims at reducing the constraints
to agricultural development as identified by the 1972 Bank Economic Mission,
lack of streamlined organization, want of greater attention to research and
extension, inadequacy of credit and a weak marketing system.
1.02      Bank Group lending to Jordan began in 1961 and to date the Associa-
tion has made eight credits totaling US$40.3 million (net of cancellation).
The first four credits-two for agricultural credit (US$6.0 million) and two
for water supply (US$4.0 million)--were made before 1967 when war and local
disturbances interrupted Bank Group operations until 1971. All of these
credits have been fully disbursed. Four additional credits have been ap-
proved since mid-1971: one for a highway project (US$6 million in 1971), one
for education (US$5.4 million in 1972), one for power (US$10.2 million in
1973) and one for water supply (US$8.7 million in 1973). With the exception
of the last two credits, on which it is too early to report, progress has been
satisfactory. The proposed credit of US$7.5 million would be the ninth credit
made to Jordan but it would be the first for irrigated agriculture and rural
development.
1.03      This report is based on technical feasibility studies on Jordan
Valley development prepared in 1969 by consultants Nedeco and Dar el Handasah,
supplemented by subsequent studies by the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC) and
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program (1973). Several additional studies and data
on water resources, drainage, marketing, credit and other related aspects were



- 2 -
also available for use by the mission. The project was appraised in September
1973 by Messrs. M. Altaf Hussain, Sadiq M. Niaz, Michael Raczynski and Harry
E. Walters who also prepared this report.
II. BACKGROUND
Country
2.01      Jordan is situated in the arid zone of the Middle East, and covers
190,000 km2 of which about 6,000 km2 lie on the West Bank of the Jordan River
now under Israeli occupation. The population of Jordan, as estimated in mid-
1973, is 2.68 million, of which 770,000 live on the West Bank and 1.91 mil-
lion in the rest of the country. The population growth has averaged 3.3%
per annum since 1961. The Government is a hereditary constitutional monarchy
with a bicameral legislature consisting of Notables appointed by the King and
a Council of Representatives elected by male suffrage. Executive power is
vested in the King who appoints the Cabinet and the Prime Minister.
2.02      Prior to the 1967 war the economy was growing at about 8% per
year. The growth in per capita GNP averaged 4.7% between 1961 and 1966.
This trend was interrupted by the war, which resulted in the loss of the
West Bank. While the West Bank represented only 6. of Jordanian territory
its loss resulted in a 35-45% drop in GNP and a substantial reduction in
tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings. In 1969, however, the economy
partially recovered, largely due to the exceptionally good climatic condi-
tions which enabled increased agricultural production. Civil disturbances
in 1970, however, halted this trend, causing the economy to fall to the 1967
level. The Government therefore prepared a Three-Year Development Plan
(1973-75) in mid-1972, with the objectives of increasing GDP by 8% annually,
creating 70,000 new jobs, narrowing income discrepancies and reducing budget
and trade deficits.
Agricultural Sector
2.03      Agriculture accounts for one-fifth of GDP in East Jordan and is
the largest production sector in the economy. It provides the main source
of livelihood for one-third of the labor force and nearly one-third of the
export revenues. The principal agricultural exports are tomatoes and citrus.
Although agriculture is an important sector it does not meet the nation's
needs of several agricultural commodities. Food grains, mainly wheat and
rice, meat and dairy products and fruit and vegetables are the major import
commodities. The trade deficit which can be narrowed in agricultural commo-
dities is currently over JD 20 million a year.



- 3 -
2.04      The most important exploitable resources in Jordan are land and
water. Out of the total area of 19 million ha, only 350,000 ha or 1.8%, is
cultivated, More than 90% of the cultivated land is dependent on limited
and irregular rainfall.  There is little possibility of expanding the area
which can be cu]tivated under rainfed conditions. Most of the 25,000 ha of
irrigated land, which accounts for 70% of agricultural production, lies in
the Jordan Valley. The Valley has land and water suitable for expansion of
irrigated agriculture. In order to accelerate its exploitation, the Jordan
Valley Commission, with wide administrative and executive power, was set up
in 1072. The Commission, as a starting point, prepared for the Valley a
Three-Year Development Plan (1973-75) within the overall concept of the
National Development Plan. The Plan emphasizes water development; and the
proposed project prominently figures in it.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
3.01      The project area covers 7,700 ha and is located in the northern
part of the Jordan Valley. Its boundaries are the Jordan River on the west,
Wadi Yabis in the south, the Yarmouk River to the north and the foothills of
the Eastern high Plateau to the east.
Climate
3.02      The climate is Mediterranean with characteristic hot, dry summers
and moderately cool, wet winters. RAinfall averages 360 mm, about 90% of
which falls during November to March and 45% in December and January. Aver-
age monthly temperatures range from 14WC in January to 31C in August. Monthly
mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures are about 120 above or below these
values. Frost occurs occasionally in January. Clear skies are typical. Sun-
shine hours range from 54% in January to 90% in August. Winds are light to
moderate and predominantly from west to southwest. High temperatures and dry
air in summer as well as cool weather in winter are constraints for certain
crops. Climatic data are summarized in Annex 1.
Topography and Drainage
3.03      The project area is subdivided into two natural zones, the Zor
which extends along the Jordan river and the Chor which includes the side
terraces. The Valley has a general slope of 1% from north to south. The
project area is cut by three wadis: Arab, Ziglab and Jurum. The cross
slopes of the Valley vary from almost 0 to 1% in the Zor area, 1 to 3% in the
Lower Ghor and 2 to 5% in the Upper Ghor. The transition zone between Zor
and Ghor is irregular and only a very small part of this area would be irri-
gated by the project. The project area is drained, in general by the wadis.
The irrigated area below the canal is served bv surface drains, some of which
do not function effectively.



-4-
Soils
3.04      Soils on the Chor terraces are of colluvial origin, moderately
fine-texttured with a depth varying from 90 cm to several meters.  Isolated
spots show heavy textures with restricted drainage. The Zor has deep, al-
luvial soil without profile development. Textures are medium to moderately
coarse. According to UTnited States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) standards,
about 93% of the soils in the project area belong to Classes I and II and
onlv 7% to Class III and as such are suitable for growing a wide variety of
crons. Salinitv and alkalinity hazards are confined to isolated patches of
restricted drainage which add up to 725 ha. Subsurface drains are being
installed in a part of this area.
Population
3.05      The population of the project area is 25,000 persons, of which one-
third is born in the area. About half are refugees from Palestine and the
remain(der immigrants from other parts of the country.  The city of North
Shulneh, located within the project area, is the largest settlement in the
Jordan Valley with a population of about 7,700. Two other villages in the
project area, Waqqas and Mashare, have populations above 3,000.
3.06      Approximately 53% of the population is below 15 years old which is
close to the national average of 55%. The male and female population is
evenly divided and an average size household has 5.7 persons of which one-
third are of working age, with a potential of about 62.5 man-days of labor
per month. 21% of the population is of school-age (5,250 children). This
familv size is smaller than the national average but the working age group is
larger because some non-active population left the Valley during the 1967 War
anid civil disturbances.
i.aTkd Tenute and Farm Size
'07       Jordanian law requires that landholdings in government-developed
svrigation areas should be allocated in 3 ha holdings of Class I and II land
and 5 na of Class III land. The maximum holding in such areas, which is
allow d to present large owners should not exceed 20 ha.  There are no size
reistrtrctions on land ownership in unirrigated areas.
A survev carried out in February/March 1973 in the project area
it.dicated that about 85% of holdings in the project area are within the range
3 to 6 ha (Annex 2).  About 40% of the project area is owner-operated and
60%. sharecropped or rented to tenants.  Sharecropping, mostly on holdings of
3 ha is the dominant form of farming.
3.OQ      The newly irrigated area of the project has been acquired and will
he reallocated to comply with existing Jordanian law. The Natural Resources
Authority has the legal and administrative machinery for land acquisition and
reallocation. Priority is given to existing owners engaged in farming, fol-
lowqed bv sharecroppers and tenants living in the area. If there is still

some land available, it is given to landless laborers (Annex 2). There is
no need to bring settlers into the area for the new irrigated land. The old
owners are compensated on fixed price which is charged to the new owners.
The payment of the compensation is spread over 5 to 20 years depending on
the amount Involved - the higher the amount the longer the period.
Transport and Communications
3.10      The road network which is the only means of transport for the proj-
ect area adequately serves to move present agricultural production.  Further
exransion is planned under U.S. hilateral aid. The network consists of the
North-South National Highway which extends from Adasiya in the north to the
Dead Sea. This highway is connected to the Eastern Plateau by four roads,
one of wlhich starts in the project area. The North Shuneh-Irbid road joins
northern towns of the Jordan Valley with Iraq passing Irbid and Mafraq;
another branch forks to the north connecting Syria and Lebanon with Jordan.
The most direct route to Amman starts in Al Ardha, but because of steep grades
is unsuitable for heavy traffic. All roads are asphalted and usable through-
out the year. Feeder roads within the project area exist, but need improve-
mnent.
Electricity
3.11      There are only isolated electricity and power supply systems within
the project area. Generation in all cases is by means of small diesel/
generator sets, while distribution is by low voltage networks. The project,
how.ever, would require no additional power for direct uses because the
sprinkler system wqould be gravity fed.  Any future requirements for indus-
trial and urban needs would be provided under the proposed aid program of the
Federal Republic of Germany which is currently being discussed.
Dorestic Water Supply
3.12      Onlv the town of North Shuneh has regular water supply constructed
and operated by local authorities. The remainder of the project obtains its
water from either local wells or springs. Piped water supply up to community
points would be provided under the project for almost all villages and towns.
Present Land Use and Yields
3.13     O(ut of 7,700 ha about 6,660 ha are irrigated; the remainder 1,040
ha is dry-farmed. Overall cropping intensity is 99%. On irrigated land the
cropping intensity is about 106% and on dry land, where a wheat and fallow
rotation is practiced, 50%.  The main crops grown in the area are vegetables,
fruiit trees and to a minor extent cereals.  Present yields of vegetables range
around 17 tons/ha for tomatoes, 15 tons/ha for eggplants and 10 tons/ha for
cucumrber and squash. Citrus orchards yield about 17 tons/ha. The total pro-
duction of the project area amounts to 72,000 tons of vegetables, 25,000 tons
of fruit and 2,000 tons of grains. Present yields, production and cropping
ilitensity can be substantially increased through irrigation of dry land, im-
provement: of present irrigation practices, changing of cropping patterns and



- 6-
greater application of technology. Annex I gives details of the present and
proposed cropping pattern, areas, yie!lds and production.
Agricultural Research and Extension
3.14      Agricultural Research in the project area was interrupted during
967 war and was not resumed until 1973, when a research program for the
Jordan Valley was started by the Ministry of Agriculture, Department of
Research and Extension. The main objectives of research are to increase
vields, reduce production costs and gear production towards market demands.
The existing main experiment station at Deir Alla is not typical of the eco-
logical conditions of the project area.  However, it has a substation Et Wadi
Yabis which has representative conditions and could be equipped to carry out
necessary experiments.
3.1s      The Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Research and Extension
is responsible for agricultural extension in the Valley. The service is
poor, lacking in staff, basic equipment and means of transportation. An
INDP-FAO Technical Assistance Program is assisting the department to improve
its services.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The project would consist of:  (a) tie main works for the develop-
ment: of 7,700 ha net, of which 6,660 ha are already under irrigation; (b) the
provision of facilities (minor works) for domestic water supply, health, edu-
cation, transport and community development to benefit the project population
of 25,000. Proposed project works are summarized below; details are pre8ent-
ed in Annex 3 and Map 10746R.
(a) Main Works
(i) 2 diversion weirs and siltation reservoirs;
(ii) 55 km of primary and secondary pipelines and a distribu-
tion network to serve bv sprinkler irrigation, a total
of 2,760 ha net;
(iii)  30 km of farm roads;
(iv) land leveling of about 3,000 ha;
(v)  tile drainage of about 520 ha;
(vi) rehabilitation works on the existing East Ghor Canal; and
(vii) 2 assembly markets.



-7-
(b) Minor Works
(i)  treated water supply system for about 10 villages;
(ii) 3 new health centers and extension of an existing
center;
(iii)  about 150 classrooms;
(iv)  a vocational training center;
(v)  improvements to about 60 km of roads; and
(vi) about 10 community de-reLopment centers.
The project would provide equipment and materials for maintenance of irriga-
tion works and roads and furniture and equipment for the health centers,
schools and community centers. The project would also provide an agricul-
tural credit component to help finance loans for agricultural and on-farm
development.
4.02      The project, which would take about 4 years to complete, would be
executed by appropriate Government agencies under the overall responsibility
of the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC). Consultant services for design and
construction supervision of irrigation works would be furnished under the
project, and existing management, agricultural research and extension serv-
ices would be strengthened.
Main lWorks
4.03      Of the presently irrigated part of the project area (6,660 ha net),
about 5,Q4n ha net receive supplies from the netwTork of the existing East
Chor Canal and about 720 ha net, lving above the command of this canal, are
irrigated by local use of the flow from 3 perennial wadis. Under the project,
the area irrigated by the 3 wadis (720 ha) and about 1,000 ha out of the area
irrigated by the East Chor Canal would be converted from gravity to sprinkler
irrigation. In addition, about 1,040 ha net of new area, lying above the
command of the canal and presently suhjected to rainfed agriculture, would be
provided with sprinkler irrigation. About 4,940 ha would continue to receive
irrigation from the East Ghor Canal system.  Land leveling and tile drainage
would be provided in parts of this area to improve production. Details of
works to be constructed for introduction of sprinkler irrigation and improveme-tt
of agriculture in the canal-irrigated areas are given below.
4.04      Diversion Weirs.  Two weirs, about 15-20 m long, would be constructe&
on Wadi Arab and Wadi Jurum to enable diversion of supplies into '.e primatvY
pipeline of the sprinkler system. Before entering the pipeline, water would
pass through a siltation reservoir, where the suspended silt load woulT settle.
A weir or siltation reservoir would not be required on Wadi Ziglab, as a stor-
age dam (capacity 4.3 Mm3) already exists there.   The outlet pipe from, the



-8-
reservoir would be directly connected to the primary pipeline. Both weirs and
the dam would divert water at such level that adequate pressure would build up
in the pipeline by gravity and a pressure of at least 3 1/2 atmospheres would
be available at the field outlets.
4.05      Primary and Secondary Pipelines.  An asbestos cement pipeline of
varting diameter would be buried along the eastern project boundary, generally
at the (-) 195 m contour level, and would extend from Wadi Jurum in the south
to a point about 8 km north of Wadi Arab. A short stretch of pipeline would
extend south of Wadi Jurum. To feed about 1,000 ha lying below the East Ghor
Canal, pipelines would branch off from the primary pipeline at suitable loca-
tions, cross the canal and run parallel to the canal. The total length of
t:hese primary and secondary pipelines is estimated at 55 km.
4.06      Distribution Network.  The distribution network would consist of
buried tertiary pipes, farm outlets and farm mainline pipes. Tertiary pipes
would take off either directly from the primary pipeline, as in the case
of the area above the East Ghor Canal, or from the secondary pipelines, as
in the area below the canal. The tertiary pipes would be aligned perpendi-
cular to the natural ground slope and would be 450 m apart. Each tertiary
pipe would provide suitably located farm outlets along its length. Each
outlet would serve two farms, one on either side, through independent farm
mainline pipes. Sprinkler risers, 12 m apart, would be provided on farm
pipcs. The sprinkler systenm would be designed to furnish a maximum of
0.56 1/sec/ha at a pressure of at least 3 1/2 atmospheres at the sprinklers.
Thie capacity of each outlet would be about 4.5 1/sec.
4.07      Farm Roads.  About 30 km of farm roads would be constructed in the
area above thle !:ast GThor Canal.  Tlese roads would be 5 m wide; the central
3-m width would be gravelled to provide all-weather access to the farms.
4.03      Land Leveling.  Land leveling would be carried out on about 3,000
ha lying below and irrigated from the East Ghor Canal. Because of steep
grotnd slopes, which vary from 1 to 3%, irrigation is carried out by zigzag
furrows. After land leveling, straight furrows would be introduced which
woudO  result in a substantial saving in labor input.  An average of 300 m3/ha
w.:ould have to be moved.  In the new area, above the canal, some leveling would
be carried out to remove occasional high spots.
,.U19     Tile Drainage.  Local units of tile drainage systems would be pro-
vicel t't  imiprove drainage on about 520 ha of the area currently served by
ti *  ast k;iior Canal.  Open drains exist in this area but do not provide ef-
fective drainage; consequently most of this area has already gone out of
cultivation. Field drains 10 cm in diameter and collector drains 15 to 20
cmii in diameLer would be installed.  Collector drains would discharge into
the existing drains, wlhiclh outfall into the Jordan River.
4.10      Rehabilitation Works on East Ghor Canal.  In the head reach of the
Iast Ghor Canal, some works would be constructed to improve cross-drainage of
surface flow. These would include two overchutes for hill torrents presently
outfalling into the canal, construction of boundary drains to avoid the entry



- 9-
into the canal of drainage flow from canal cuts and improving surface drain-
age through existing culverts across the canal. These works, by reducing
entrv of debris into the canal, would increase its efficiencv and reduce
annual maintenance.
4.11      Assembly Markrets and Packing and Grading Stations.  There are no
assembly markets in the project area. Further south, however, there are
two small privnte markets. This project would establish two assembly markets
adjoining each of the existing packing and grading stations at Wadi Yabis
and North Shuneh. These stations established in 1966 are currently little
used mainly due to ill defined responsibility and poor management for their
operation. Each has a large, well constructed building with equipment and
facilities. The grading line in North Shuneh is in good condition but the
line in Wadi Yabis was badly damaged during civil disorders of 1970.  Both
would be refurbished under the project. Details are in Annex 4. The pres-
ent management of the packing and grading stations is unsatisfactory. In
the future the Agricultural Marketing Organization (AMO), an existing semi-
autonomous institution responsible for market supervision and management in
Jordan would manage and supervise these stations. AM]o would charge a fee of
5% and 1% of the gross value of produce handled for picking and grading re-
spectively. Assurances were obtained that the operating and managing rights
would be transferred to AMO not later than September 30, 1974.
4.12      Operation and Maintenance Equipment.  Equipment and vehicles required
to operate and maintain the sprinkler irrigation system, the East Ghor system
and farm roads would be provided. Some office and workshop equipment together
with small aqantities of asbestos cement pipes, pipe fittings, valves, water
meters etc. would also be provided for initial maintenance of the sprinkler
network. A list of equipment is given in Annex 5.
4.13      On-Farm Development.  The on-farm sprinkler systems would be de-
signed by the consultant and the on-farm portable pipes and sprinklers would
be supplied to the farmers unider medium-term credit. Other on-farm develop-
ments would also be carried out under medium- and long-term credits. The
farmers would contribute 20% of the total cost of such investments and the
project would finance the balance. NRA assisted by consultants would pre-
pare specifications and import the mobile sprinkler equipment. Imports would
be phased over two to three years to match the construction schedule. NRA
would store this equipment at its workshop at Deir Alla for direct sale to
project farmers or transfer to them upon presentation of credit agreement
with ACC.
Minor Works
4.14      Within the project area and along the north-south road, JVC is re-
constructing 10 villages destroyed during the 1967 war and following disturb-
ances. As a housing program has already started the project would not provide
for this item. However, except for North Shuneh, none of the villages have
either a proper drinking water supply, health facilities or school buildings.
The project would provide the villages with these facilities and would enlarge



- 10 -
and improve the existing facilities in North Shuneh. In addition existing
village roads, mostly along laterals of the East Ghor Canal system, would be
improved and regravelled. Ten community centers, one in each village, would
be constructed and the vocational school would be supplemented.
'+.1S5    nooiestic Water Supriv.  Water supply for domestic purposes would
>ot furnished to 10 project v-llages from the primary pipeline of the sprink-
oer -rrigation system.  Filtration tanks would be provided at suitable loca-
tions, and after chlorination water would be conveyed through asbestos cement
pipes of appropriate diameter to small overhead tanks. Distribution system
within the villages would serve community taps, which would be located at
suitable points along village streets. The new system for water supply to
North Shuneh would supplement and enlarge the existing system. Like the
irrigation svstem, the water supply main lines and distribution lines would
also be pressurized by gravity and no pumping would be required.
4 1k      Health Centers.  At present no health facilities exist in the project
area, except one health center at North Shuneh which would be enlarged into an
8 hed field hospital consisting of an out-patient's block, X-ray and dentistry
facilities and a small laboratory, and would be provided with necessary equip-
ment, furniture and instruments. An ambulance and a vehicle would also be
provided to transport patients requiring specialist attention to the hospital
at Irbid. Three health centers would be constructed at Adasiya, Waqqas and
Mashare these would also be provided with necessary equipment, furniture and
instruments. The field hospital and the 3 centers would be adequately staffed
by Government in order to provide reasonable comprehensive medical care.
4.17      Schools.  About 150 class rooms would be constructed under the proj-
ect to replace rented facilities and schools damaged or destroyed during the
1967 war and following disturbances. The exact size of the school or schools
for each village would be determined by JVC and the Education Department.
Most of the schoolrooms would be for preparatory and primary level classes
while some would be for preparatory level. Necessary equipment and furniture
for these schools would also be provided. The facilities described would
satisfy the needs for 6,000 students.
4.18      Vocational Training Center.  Government is expanding, under UNDP/FAO
assistance, a field research and extension station at Deir Alla for strengthening
the activities of the Department of Research and Extension in the Jordan Valley.
Unider the project a vocational training center, which would also serve the
whole Valley would be constructed at the substation in Wadi Yabis. The center
would be used primarily for short- and long-term training of the Valley farmers
in agricultural activities relevant to the Valley including sprinkler irriga-
tion techniques. Two lecture halls, a wprkshop and necessary equipment would
be provided under the project.
/,.1'l    Roads.  Apart from the paved north-south road, the existing road
along the East Chor Canal and the existing roads along the laterals of the
Canal provide the means of transport between various project villages and the
project area. The roads along the Canal (35 km) and the roads along the la-
terals (60 kmn) falling within the project area would be improved under the



- 11 -
project and some of these would be regravelled. The road (2.5 km) connecting
the existing Ziglab dam to the main road would be provided with 4 m wide as-
phalt top.
4.20      Community Centers.  Ten community centers - one in each project
village would be constructed. These centers, consisting of 3 rooms and an-
cillary facilities, would be used by extension agents for educating the far-
mers and would also serve as local offices of the Farmers's Association. In
general they would be used to promote social development of the farmers in
the project area. Necessary furniture and equipment would be provided.
Water Demand, Supply and Quality
4.21      Water Demand.  At full irrigation demand (1976), the gross water
demand for the gravity irrigated part of the project area (4,940 ha) is es-
timated at 55.3 Mm3, whereas the gross demand for the sprinkler-irrigated
area (2,760 ha), at its full development in 1979, would be 25.1 Mm3. These
demands are based on the proposed cropping pattern and an irrigation in-
tensity of 120%. An overall efficiency of 65% for gravity and 80% for
sprinkler irrigation has been assumed. Details are given in Annex 7.
4.22      Water Supply.  The project area would use water from two sources:
(a) the existing East Ghor Canal, which draws its supplies from the Yarmouk
river, and (b) Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum - three major tributaries of the
Jordan river within the project area. The Yarmouk river has an average annual
flow of 438 Mm3 near the East Ghor Canal intake, of which an average of 119
Mm3 per annum (maximum of 157.3 Mm3 in 1971-72) is withdrawn into the Canal.
Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum have a respective average annual flow of 31.8 Mm3,
10.6 Mm3 and 11.2 Mm3 (Annex 7). The three Wadis irrigate only 720 ha at
present and their surplus water flows into the East Ghor Canal. Both the
Canal water and the waters of the three Wadis have been wastefully used for
irrigation in the past (15,830 m3/ha) with low efficiency. Under the project,
the are5 to be served by sprinkler irrigation (2,760 ha) would use about
9,112 m /ha and the area which woul I continue to remain under gravity irriga-
tion (4,940 ha) would need 11,215 m /ha (Annex 7).
4.23      Areas presently irrigated from the two supply sources and the quan-
titv of water presently used for irrigation are given below along with the
future areas to be irrigated from these sources and the future water demand:

The total water demand under the project would amount to 80.4 MM3, which even
after (a) bringing an additional area of 1,040 under irrigation, and (b) main-
taining the presently irrigated area of 6,660 ha but with better water manage-
ment, would result in an annual saving of 25.0 Mm3.
4.24      Water Quality.  The Yarmouk water and waters of Wadis Arab and
Ziglab are of medium salinity and low sodium and alkali hazard (C2S1 Class).
Wadi Jurum water, classified as C3S1, has a salinity, only slightly Rbove
the C2 limit (Annex 7). In general, these waters are of acceptable quality
especially as they have been and would be used on areas with adequate natural
drainage. In some parts of the project area where drainage is a problem,
tile drainage would be provided under the project.
Water Rights
4.25      The Yarmouk is an international river with Syria and Jordan as
riparian states. Israel is a downstream beneficiary. An international treaty,
signed between Jordan and Syria in June 1953, assures enough water from the
Yarmouk for the project.  As in the future the project would only use 59%  3
(55.3 Mm3) of the Yarmouk water presently used in the project area (94.0 Mm3)
the project is not considered harmful to the interest of the downstream ri-
parians. Waters from the side wadis would continue to be used entirely in
Jordan. If necessary, JVC can acquire any private water rights on the waters.
of these wadis, under the powers vested in the Commission by JVC Law.
Construction Schedule
4.26      JVC plans to employ a consulting firm as soon as possible to pre-
pare designs and contract documents for the main contract comprising irriga-
tion works and for its construction supervision. This contract would be



- 13 -
awarded by November 1974, after international competitive bidding, and cons-
truction would be completed by March 1977. Other works, mostly small in mag-
nitude, would be designed by departments concerned and constructed by local
contractors. Their construction would be scattered between October 1974 and
December 1976.  Procurement of on-farm sprinkler equipment, under medium-
term credit, and disbursement of credit for other purposes would extend up to
1978. A detailed construction schedule is attached as Chart 8379R (Annex 8).
Cost Estimates
t
4.27      The total project cost, excluding import duties, is estimated at
US$17.4 million (JD 5.6 million), including US$4.9 million (JD 1.6 million)
for physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is estimated
at US$9.1 million (JD 2.9 million), or 52% of the total cost. The cost of
the main development works, including physical and price contingencies,
amounts tc US$14.0 million (JD 4.5 million), with a foreign exchange cost of
US$7.5 million or 53%. The cost of the minor works, including physical and
price contingencies, is US$3.4 million (JD 1.1 million) with a foreign ex-
change cost of US$1.6 million or 48%. The social development works are about
20% of the total project cost. The cost estimates are based on unit rates
estimated for similar works in the southern part of the Jordan Valley and
other relevant cost data. For irrigation works, physical contingencies are
estimated at 15%, and for all other items at 10%. For all civil works, price
contingencies are compounded at annual rates of 12% (1974), 10X (1975); and
8% (1976 and 1977); whereas for equipment costs the rates used are 9% (1974),
7% (1975) and 5% (1976 to 1978). For land, engineering and administration,
price contingencies are estimated ai: 6.5% compounded for foreign expenditure
and 10% compounded for local expenditure. Detailed estimates are given in
Annex 9, Table 1 and are suinmarized below:

Financing
4.29      An IDA credit of US$7.5 million would finance about 43% of the proj-
ect cost, and would cover about 82% of the foreign exchange cost.  Government
would finance the balance (18%) of the foreign exchange cost (US$1.6 million)
and about US$7.6 million equivalent or 92% of local costs. Project farmers
would put up the balance 8% of the local costs (US$0.66 million equivalent) -
as their share representing 20% of the agricultural credit requirement. The
IDA credit would include retroactive financing of about US$175,000 to cover
the cost of consultants to be appointed shortly. The financing plan would
be as follows:
JD '000       US$'000        % of Project Costs

Total             5 610         17 429                100
Procurement
4.30      The irrigation works and the main system of rural water supply,
costing US$5.5 million, would be grouped into one contract, which would be
awarded by JVC in consultation with the agencies concerned after international
competitive bidding in accordance with World Bank guidelines. Domestic sup-
pliers would receive a preference equivalent to the existing import duties
or 15% of the c.i.f. cost, whichever is the lower. Contracts for procurement
of equipment and materials (US$3.4 million) including the on-farm sprinkler
system and other farm equipment and materials exceeding US$10,000 in value,
would also be awarded following international competition in accordance wit.l
World Bank guidelines. Assurances were obtained to th_s effect. Equipment
and materials contracts costing less than US$10,000 would be awarded locally
subject to an aggregate of US$100,000 in accordance with normal government
procedures, which are satisfactory.
4.31      Other project works (construction of schools, health centers, roads,
etc. (US$1.8 million) are of varying nature, small in magnitude and Located
in several project villages. These would, therefore, be constructed ur.der
several contracts after local competitive bidding in accordance with normal



- 16 -
Government procurement procedures. For local contracts exceeding US$200,000,
bidding documents would be furnished to IDA for approval prior to their issue
to prequalified local contractors and a-wards would be made in consultation
with IDA. Assurances were obtained to this effect.
Disbursements
4.32      The proposed IDA credit of US$7.5 million would be disbursed over 5
years, including retroactive financing of not more than US$175,000 of foreign
exchange expenditure of the consulting firm, to finance:
Civil Works                    - 50% of total expenditure
Equiument and Materials        - the CIF cost of directly imported
goods and 80% of total costs of
goods purchased from local suppliers.
Technical Services             - 100% of the foreign exchange costs of
the consulting firms and individual
experts.
Mobile Sprinkler Equipment,   - 38% of loan payments made by Agricul-
Other Farm Machinery and         tural Credit Corporation (ACC) against
Inputs                           short-, medium-, and long-term credit
to project farmers.
Disbursement requests would be supported by full documentation, Except for
loans made to farmers to be disbursed against a statement of expenditures,
the supporting documents of which would be retained by the executing agency
and be available for review by project supervision mission. All savingsa,
after project completion, would be. cancelled. An estimated quarterly dis-
bursement schedule is given in Annex 11.
Land.Acquisition
! .33     Project works would require about 75 ha, which would be acquired
dnder the existing laws after payment of compensation but prior to the award
of respective construction contracts. Assurances were obtained to this effect.
t%nvironment and Health
i.34     The project area is free of endemic diseases like malaria and
bilharzia. Malaria was endemic to the Jordan Valley prior to 1953, but with
assistance from WHO and UNRWA it was eradicated by 1961.  Government's Health
Department is adequately equipped to take necessary preventive measures.
Assurances were obtained that the Health Department would monitor the project
area for any recurrence of malaria and promptly take necessary remedial measures.

4.35      The project would not adversely affect the environment but would
in fact improve it as the flow of the three wadis, presently in open channels,
would be piped for sprinkler irrigation.
V.  ORGANIZAT:.ON AND MANAGEMENT
Jordan Vallev Commission
5.01      The Jordan Valley Commission (JVC) was established under law in
1973 as a public entity with the sole responsibility of economic and social
development of the entire Jordan Valley (Enclosure Annex 6). The project
would involve the northern third of the Valley, while the remaining two-
thirds would be developed with assistance from other donors, maifly the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, US-AID and the Federa'i. Republic
of Germany. JVC has adequate administrative and financial powers for its
operations. It is headed by a President, who is also its ex-officio Director
General, who reports directly to the Prime Minister, and three Commissioners.
The Commissioners are appointed by the Council of Ministers on the recom-
mendation of the President of JVC and can be government officials or private
individuals. JVC would have overall responsibility for project implementa-
tion, including overall planning, coordination, supervision and financial
control. At present, JVC is working mainly with borrowed staff, which is
inadequate to perform its functions. Therefore, it should be organized on
proper lines and staffed adequately as a matter of priority. It has been
agreed with JVC that the following 4 directorates (Chart 8371R Annex 6) would
be established: (a) Irrigation, Drainage and Farm Roads; (b) Agriculture,
Marketing and Credit; (c) Town Planning, Housing, Public Services and High-
ways; and (d) Financial Management and Administration. In addition, an
officer directly reporting to the Deputy Director General would deal with
social and community development. Substantial progress has been made in
staffing the five directorates. Assurances were obtained that JVC will con-
tinue to be staffed with qualified personnel and that any change in its or-
ganizational structure be implemented in accordance with IDA.
5.02      The powers of JVC and its relations with Government, government
agencies, contractors and other groups are explicitly set forth in the law
establishing it. The law establishes provisions whereby:
(a) JVC can receive proceeds of any loans or credits arranged by
Government as well as supplemental funds allocated by Govern-
ment in the budget. It can also receive funds from other
sources.



(b)  JVC can employ cornsultants for -paroject works, award contracts,
exercise overall supervision and financial control and make
payments for works completed.
(c) JVC can delegate to NRA execution and supervision responsibility
for irrigation and other related works, and NRA will have to es-
tablish a separate unit to carry out these duties. The head of
thl.s unit will report directly to JVC.
(d)  JVC can transfer funds to ACC, through a subsidiary loan agree-
ment, for carrying out the credit provisions of the project.
ACC will have to establ sh a separate accounting system for
these funds and will be responsible to JVC for carrying out
the provisions of this agreement.
(e) JVC has the authority to make appropriate arrangements with
other government agencies - AMO, Department of Research and
Extension, Public Works, etc. -- to carry out project ele-
ments appropriate to these agencies, and to ensure their
proper implementation.
JVC will thus receive project funds and act as the management agency in the
project area exercising firm management and financial control over all project
elements. It will not, however, have the staff to exercise detailed super-
vision over specific aspects of the numerous project elements. This function,
therefore, will be delegated to other agencies, which will be fully respons-
ible. JVC will retain the ultimate authority and the right to undertake those
activities which are not carried out to its satisfaction.
Project Execution, Operation and Maintenance
5.03      Because of its multi-sectoral nature, the project would be executed
by several government agencies under the arrangements outlined in para 5.02.
NRA would be fully responsible for the construction of all hydraulic works
including tile drainage, land leveling and rural water supply. It would also
be responsible for operation and maintenance of the gravity and sprinkler irri-
gation systems, rural water supply, drainage and farm roads, for which equipment
(Annex 5) would be provided under the project. The Public Works Department
would be fully responsible for the construction of primary markets, health
centers, schools, the vocational training center, public roads and community
centers, and also for the maintenance of these facilities. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Department of Research and Extension would provide extension and
research services and training support for the project. AMO would manage the
primary markets and packing and grading stations and would be responsible for
providing facilities for marketing and market intelligence. It would also
collect project charges for NRA and recover loans for ACC. AMO would also
train professional staff of the Farmers' Association (FA) with a view to
transferring its functions to FA, as soon as possible. Assurances were ob-
tained that IDA would be consulted prior to this transfer. The Agricultural
Credit Corporation (ACC) would be responsible for assessing the credit require-
ments of the project farmers, with the assistance of the extension staff and FA,



- 19 -
and meeting these requirements in time. The Education and Health Departments
would coordinate with JVC and the Public Works Department during the planning
and construction phase of the schools and health centers. Followi;ng their
completion, these Departments would provide adequate operational and super-
visory staff and be responsible for the efficient operation of these education
and health facilities, and assurances were obtained to this effect. All the
above lisl:ed agencies are competent to carry out the work to be entrusted to
them unde-' JVC's overall guidance.  Operation and maintenance costs of the
project (excluding JVC headquarter staff) are estimated at JD 80,000 (US$248,000)
per annum; these would amount to JD 10.4/ha (US$33/ha).
Consultants
5.04      JVC is finalizing a contract with the consultants Nedeco and Dar
el liandasah, who prepared the feasibility studies on Jordan Valley develop-
ment, to assist NRA in the design and supervision of all irrigation works,
including the new sprinkler system and the rural water supply works. Assur-
ances were obtained that the firm would be appointed on terms and condition
acceptable to IDA and that JVC and .RA would second local engineers and other
staff to work with the firm, who would provide in service trainiAlg to them.
Proposed terms of reference and manpower requirements are given in Annex 11.
Liaison and Advisory Committee
5.05      Since many government agencies would be involved in project execu-
tion, strong liaison among these agencies and JVC is essential. Such liaison,
in addition to avoiding bureaucratic delays, duplication of effort and inter-
agency friction, will ensure the availability of competent professional ad-
vice for all project components and will impart a feeling of active partic-
ipation to the representatives of the executing agencies. A Liaison and
Advisory Committee (LAC) has been formed under the chairmanship of the
President of JVC. Its membership consists of senior representatives of all
agencies concerned. The Director of Administration of JVC is its secretary.
The membership of LAC is indicated in Chart 8371. LAC will meet at least
every 3 months to assign work priorities, coordinate project activities among
the executing agencies, and resolve difficulties. Assurances were obtained
that membership of LAC and its Terms of Reference would not be changed without
TDA's consultation.
Farmers' Association
5.06      JVC would establish a Farmers' Association (FA) for the whole
Valley withi branches in each of its 3 subdivisions - one branch would serve
the project area.  The proposed draft of a law for establishing FA has been
approved by the Council of Ministers. Each farmer, whether an owner, share-
cropper or lessee, would be a member with the right to vote for FA's Executive
Board. FA would assist the farmers in obtaining credits, inputs and other
services, as well as in marketing their produce. In the provision of these
services FA would operate to ensure an open competitive supply of inputs at
the lowest possible prices - through lowest bids on bulk supplies, etc. - and
open and competitive auctioning of produce to obtain the highest possible



- 20 -
prices for member farmers. It would no , however, engage itself in commercial
activities providing these services on a monopoly basis. Enactment of a law
establishing FA on these lines and election of its Executive Board would be
a condition of effectiveness.
Credit
5.07      The Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) is the only public in-
stitution which extends seasonal and medium-term credit for agriculture on
a countrywide basis. In 1973, ACC's total loans outstanding amounted to
JD 4.7 million. Its loans in the North Ghor area alone amounted to JD
347,532 in 1972. The Jordan Cooperative Organization (JCO) plays a limited
role. In 1972, its total loans for all of Jordan, for all purposes, amounted
to JD 343,507. In the past, it has not demonstrated a strong interest in
agricultural production or marketing operations. ACC meets only a fraction
of the total demand for seasonal credit requirements. Its lending rate is
8% per annum for seasonal loans which is reduced to 7% for borrowers who re-
pay on time. For medium-term credit the interest rate is 6% per annum with
no concession for timely repayment. ACC's lending rates and procedures have
evolved from its dealings with IDA and are satisfactory. ACC is short of
funds and plans to request a third credit from the Association; the first
2 IDA credits of US$6.0 million were obtained before 1968. The project
cost estimate (JD 800,000 for credit) includes full credit requirements
for both seasonal and medium-term loans for the project farmers, who would
contribute 20%. Of the balance, to be advanced by ACC, 38% would be met
from IDA credit and the remaining 62% would be put up by Governm6nt. The
financial needs of project farmers would be assessed by the local staff of
ACC, with the assistance of the extension service and local representatives
of FA. The assessment list would be forwarded to the nearest branch of ACC,
which would give credit up to 80% of the indicated amount to the farmers.
ACC would inform AMO of the amount loaned to each farmer and AMO would re-
cover the seasonal credits together with due instalments of medium-term
credit at the primary markets where all project farmers would be obligated
to sell their produce as members of FA.   Seasonal credit extends for one year
or less. Medium-term credit for 1 to 7 years and long-term credit 8 years or
longer. Mobile sprinkler equipment would be financed with 7 year loans from
¢uCl These loans and other intermediate and long-term loans would be under-
taken by land owners and the equipment provided to sharecroppers or tenants
unless the latter have long term leases.
-.Q8      A subsidiary loan agreement would provide that Government will lend
to ACC, through JVC, the full amount of the project's credit component includ-
ing contingencies, less farmers contribution of 20% or JD 852,000 (US$2,650,000),
(of which 38% would be met from IDA credit). ACC will lend to project farmers
at its prevailing rates of 8% for seasonal loans, with 1% refunded for timely
repayment and 6% for medium-term loans. Although commercial credit terms are
undoubtedly higher, they are obscured by commission agent practices and it
would be impractical to have project credit funds lent at rates which were
out of line with other ACC rates. Since the IDA credit component is rela-
tively smAll (38%), it is not likely that Government could be convinced to
raise its interest rates on the 62% of credit funds it provides. Furthermore,



- 2i -
higher rates for project loans would create an arbitrarily high interest rate
for project loans compared with other ACC loans. The present ACC practice of
rebating 1% of the 8% rate charged for seasonal loans when repaid on time is
a desirable practice in Jordan where loan repayment experience has not been
good. Project credit operations will be accounted for separately from other
ACC operations. With improvec collection through AMO initially and FA event-
ually, the project will assist ACC in improving its collection record, a major
objective of the Bank. The last IDA credit (1967) required Government to lend
to ACC at 3-1/4% which ACC on-lent to farmers at 5-1/2 to 6%. Since half of
the project loans would be on-lent at 7 or 8% and the remainder at 6%, and
collection improved, Government can lend funds for project loans to ACC at
4-1/4% and still allow ACC an adequate margin. Assurances were obtained that
ACC would maintain separate accounts for project credit operations, lend proj-
ect funds to project farmers for the purposes stipulated and that Government
would lend project funds, through JVC to ACC, at an interest of not less than
4-1/4% to be repaid over a period of 15 years for on-lending to project farmers
at not' less than prevailing ACC rates.
2Iarketing
5.09      At present marketing of produce is handled by commission agents.
Part of the produce goes through the Amman and Irbid wholesale markets and
part is exported by road to neighboring countries. There are no assembly
markets in the project area and much produce moves into and through the
area from the West Bank. The current practice is disadvantageous for small
farmers. To ensure favorable prices to farmers the project would require
that all project produce pass through the assembly markets. The project
would provide two assembly markets and staff to operate them. AMO would
provide market intelligence and guidance in field preparation of produce for
marketing. It would also supervise the two assembly markets and manage the
two existing packing and grading stations refurbished under the project. For
providing the marketing facilities, which include premises, accounting, light-
ing, security, cleanliness, operating staff, weighing, etc., AMO would charge
a fee of 1% of the gross value of the produce sold in the markets. The Amman
wholesale market currently provides similar services at a fee of 2% which
generates an income well in excess of costs. A fee of 5% would be charged by
packing and grading stations, which would include the costs of packing mater-
ials. This produce, 12,000 tons per year, would bring much higher prices
than ungraded and unpacked produce in the assembly markets. By the early
1980's, the proposed level of fees would cover full operation and maintenance
costs and leave a margin for the operating agency. During the early years of
the project, however, the quantity of produce marketed and the amount of re-
sulting fees would be small, and therefore a part of the operational costs
would be met from project funds. AMO would transfer the packing and gradin-
stations and the assembly markets to FA (para 5.03) as soon as FA stafe had
been trained. In order to accelerate this transfer an evaluation committee
has already been established. Assurances were obtained that collection of
market fees would be levied from the first year of operation of such facil-
ities and that IDA would be consulted before the marketing facilities are
transferred to FA. Details of costs of physical facilities for markets and
stations and staff are in Annex 4.



- 22 -
5.10      During the first three years of the project, expatriate specialists
in grading, marketing and accounting would be provided for 36 man months to
assist AMO and to train FA personnel in the relevant fields of activity.
Assurances to that effect were obtained.
Agricultural Extension, Research and Training
5.11      Extension services are provided by the Research and Extension Depart-
ment of the Ministry of Agriculture. At present, only 2 extension agents grad-
uated from secondary schools are allocated to the project area. These would
be increased to 8 under the project and would be provided with transport and
demonstration material. New Agents would be university graduates. The ex-
tension service would be supported by the research stations located in the
Valley at Wadi Yabis and Deir Alla. A complete outline of the staff and
equipment required is given in Annex 1, Table 3.
5.12      Agricultural research is a'so the responsibility of the Department
of Research and Extention of the Ministry of Agriculture. The main experi-
mental station in the Valley at Deir Alla does not fully reflect the agronomic
conditions of the project area. A research substation, at Wadi Yabis, at the
southern boundary of the project area, is more representative of conditions in
the project area. It would be provided with additional equipment and staff
under the project. At present it has 1 agronomist and 4 research assistants,
but under the project these would be increased to 4 agronomists and 9 research
assistants. The additional equipment would include transport vehicles, tractors
and other farm machinery and laboratory facilities. The training program would
emphasize refresher courses for staff and short courses for farmers. At present,
some facilities for training exist at Deir Alla under the UNDP project. In
order to fully equip a vocational training center at Wadi Yabis, the project
would provide two lecture halls, a workshop and equipment. These expanded
facilities would serve the whole Valley. Assurances were obtained that ade-
cuate staff and equipment and facilities for extension and research would be
pravided.
Ac'counts and Audit
¾, 13     Separate accounts would be kept by JVC and other Government agencies
i..1 expenditures related to the project, and such accounts would be audited
annualv by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audited accounts would
be submitted to IDA every year within 4 months after the close of the Jordanian
fiscal vear. Assurances were obtained to this effect.
Recovery of Project Costs
5.14      At present, Government recovers a part of the costs of irrigation
projects constructed with public funds through a charge on an area basis.
The amount varies by crop depending on water requirements. Such recoveries
until recently have been 1 fil/m3 up to 18,000 m3/ha/year and 2 fils/m3 for
quantities exceeding that limit. These charges did not fully cover operation
and maintenance costs, let alone investment costs. The Government has raised
its water charges to farmers from 1 fil/m3 to 3 fils/m3 in February 1974 and
has decided to gradually raise them to 6 fils/mO.



- 23 -
5.15      This new level of charges would cover operation and maintenance costs
and all direct investments chargeable to the project at 5% interest per year.
In order to measure the subsidy element, the full project cost as well as all
project revenues were discounted at 10% over 40 years. The calculation shows
that the present value of the Governthent subsidy to the beneficiaries amounts
to JD 2.5 million (US$7.75 million) c'r 40% of the costs. The recovery rate
as proposed is considered reasonable to assure adequate incentives for farmers
to increase production. Assurances were obtained that the Government, commen-
cing with the first year of irrigation in the sprinkler-irrigated areas and by
not later than the third year in the gravity irrigated areas receiving project
services, would recover a wat6r charge of not less than 6 fils/m3.  These
charges would be collected by 4MO on behalf of NTRA and transferred to the
Treasury. Assurances were also obtained that these charges would be period-
ically reviewed to ensure recovery of full operation and maintenance costs
and 60% of the investment costs with 10% interest over the project life.
VI.   ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Production
6.01      Without the project, yields on the currently irrigated project
area (6,660 ha) are expected to increase at 2% annually for the next five
years (1974-78), beyond which no further improvements due to application
of known technology are expected. No possibility for yield improvement is
foreseen in the 1,040 ha presently unirrigated.
6.02      After the project, production in the project area (7,700 ha) would
be doubled; on 4,940 ha of the presently irrigated area due to land leveling,
improved water distribution and drainage, on the remaining 1,000 ha of already
irrigated area due to conversion to sprinkler irrigation, and on 1,760 ha due
to conversion of Wadi irrigated and rainfed area into sprinkler irrigation.
With the project the present cropping intensity of 99% (106% on the irrigated
area and 50% on the unirrigated area) would increase to 120%. Greater use of
technology through improved extension service, credit and marketing facili-
ties would support development.
6.03      At present, conditioned by scanty rainfall, only cereal crops are
grown in the unirrigated area and their yields are low. In the irrigated
area, intensity of irrigation and yields are low because of poor land level-
ing and lack of drainage. Farmers have made only simple, on-farm adjustments,
such as zig-zag furrows, which consume much labor and limit development of
cropping intensity. With the project, these constraints would be removed
(Annex 1). At full production in 1983, the project's cropping pattern and
incremental production would be as follows:

Market Prospects
6.04      Cereals.  The project area at present produces a small quantity of
cereals, mostly wheat, in the rainfed area. With the project, wheat produc-
tion will decline from 2,000 tons to 1,400 tons, while maize production will
rise from 280 tons to 7,680 tons. Increased maize production would more than
offset reduced wheat production, yet cereal production in the project area
would have little effect on Jordan's large cereal import deficit. Total
cereal production in Jordan is about 210,000 tons annually and imports
average 175,000 tons. Domestic demand, much of it in the project area,
would consume the increased output of cereals from the project area.
6.05      Vegetables.  Vegetable production in Jordan is about 280,000 tons,
of which about 200,000 tons is produced in the Ghor Valley and 78,000 tons
in the project area. Tomatoes (about 150,000 tons) dominate, with eggplant
(35,000 tons) and cauliflower (15,000 tons) second and third. Jordan exports
60,000 to 80,000 tons of vegetables yearly, mostly tomatoes and eggplant.
About 20,000 tons of vegetables, mostly onions, potatoes and dry broad beans
are imported. Vegetable production in the project area would rise from its
present level of 78,000 tons to about 140,000 tons gross by 1983. Because
of the overall limits on agricultural production in Jordan, despite good pos-
sibilities in the Ghor, the rapid rate of population growth (3.5%) and high
per capita consumption of vegetables (144 kg/year) much of the incremental
production will be consumed in the domestic market. Vegetable consumption



- 25 -
is projected under modest assumptions to grow from its present level of about
185,000 tons to between 231,001) and 260,000 tons by 1980, 270,000 to 320,000
tons by 1985, and 370,000 to 450,000 tons by 1995. Thus by 1983, when the
project would be in full production, an additional 62,000 tons gross or about
55,000 tons net (deducting 10% for waste and 1,400 tons for local consumption)
would be available, while the domestic market for vegetables would have grown
by about 80,000 to 100,000 tons. Part of the domestic market would be sup-
plied by production of other parts of the Valley.
6.06      The export market for vegetables would continue to be influenced
by strong competition among neighboring producers. Political disruptions and
import policies of neighboring countries are likely to result in temporary
closure of markets like that of Syria (and consequently Lebanon) in 1972.
The advantage of the Ghor area lies in its ability to meet winter and early
spring demand. This advantage would be improved by the project which would
produce large quantities of vegetables in October-November and January-May.
The organized marketing and emphasis on quality in the project, combined
with proper grading and packing for export markets, would greatly improve
the project's competitive position in domestic and export markets. About
one-third of the project produce would be exported.
6.07      Fruits.  Present fruit production in Jordan is about 136,000 tons
and consunption is about 125,000 tons. Consumption is expected to rise to
156-206,0)0 tons by 1980; 182,000-240,000 tons by 1985, and 250,000-330,000
tons by 1995. The project's incremental citrus and banana production would
be 12,650 tons and 2,450 tons respectively. Domestic increases in consump-
tion would thus provide a local market for these modest increases. However,
as in the case of vegetables, timing is favorable in export competition but
low quality has been a handicap to Jordan in foreign markets. The project
would increase output substantially in October-December and slightly in
January-March. With the project marketing organization, which would stress
initial field sorting and then grading and packing, the competitive position
of project production in domestic and export markets should considerably im-
prove.
Prices
6.08      One set of prices has been used for both financial and economic
analysis of the project. Prices have been derived from those prevailing in
the Amman wholesale market in recent years (1968-73) with deduction for com-
mission charges, market fees, transport expenses and packaging costs appro-
priate to the project area and its distances from Amman. Adjustments have
been made for inflation and seasonal and annual instability in fruit and
vegetable prices. The method of deriving the prices is explained in Annex
13 and the actual prices used are given in Table 3, Annex 13. Import duties
on agriculture commodities and on production requisites and subsidies on cer-
tain inputs are not explicitly incorporated because: (i) although there is
a nominal import duty of 20% on bananas and 11% on citrus, it is not evident
that these duties are consistently collected nor is it clear how they might
influence Jordanian prices because of the inflow of citrus from the West Bank,



- 26 -
w%aich is regarded both as irported and locally produced; (ii) Government sub-
sidies are generally negligible, and since most fertilizer, seeds, pesticides
and other inputs are traded through private agencies in a competitive market,
tne influence of subsidies on farm level prices is negligible. We have as-
sumed, therefore, that duties and subsidies offset each other. Prices for
the highly perishable produce of the project area can be expected to be in-
fluenced primarily by domestic and neighboring market demand and supply con-
ditions and by the project areas ability to improve its competitive position
in these markets. Global price trends are likely to be much less influencial.
Farmers' Income
6.09      Farm budgets for typical vegetable, fruit and vegetable and citrus
farms, of 3, 4 and 15 ha both owner-operated and sharecropped, are presented
in Annex 14. Farmers' income has been calculated at current average farm-
gate prices, with adjustments for seasonal fluctuations and inflation (Annex
13). Production costs include all inputs, valued at current average prices,
and take into account family and hired labor and machinery required by differ-
ent farms, owner-operated or sharecropped. Family and hired labor have been
costed at JD .75 and JD 1.0 per day. The cost of establishing orchards for
the pre-fruit yielding years, including cost of water and irrigation equipment,
has bc-eii annualized at 10% per year. Interest on working capital has been
taken into account, at 10% per annum for 12 months for perennial crops and
for 6 months for seasonal crops. Also included in costs is a JD 1/ha tax on
agricultural land. Project charges after the project have been levied at 6
fils per m3 of water used. Based on these assumptions and after payment of
project charges the incremental income from 3 ha vegetable farms, 3 ha fruit
and vegetable farms and 4 ha citrus farms is estimated at JD 496-566, 427-468
and 734. On large 15 ha farms which only represent about 1% of the project
area, the incremental income is estimated at JD 3,040-3,189 on fruit and
vegetable farms and JD 2,091 on citrus farms. The range of incomes for certain
types reflects the differences in gravity and sprinkler costs. Based on a
family size of 5.7 persons the income per capita of sharecroppers would in-
crease from JD 54 to JD 97-106 on vegetable farms and from JD 86 to JD 124-127
on fruit and vegetable farms. If owner operated the per capita income from
these farms would increase from JD 118 to 217 and JD 180 to 267 respectively.
This compares with an average national per capita income of JD 82 at present
and JD 96 projected for 1983. The project charges would range between 17%
and 36% of the incremental income for 3 ha and 15 ha farms respectively.
Economic Benefits
6.10      The major quantifiable economic benefit is the significant increase
in tlhe production of high value fruits and vegetables which would result in:
(a) additional foreign exchange earnings valued at US$6.0 million per year.
(b) increased domestic supplies of fruits and vegetables; and (c) improved
incomes for about 1,700 farm families.



- 27 -
6.11      The annual net value of production would rise from JD 1,760,000
which it would have reached and stabilized at in 1978 without the project,
to 3,762,000 by 1983, an incremental benefit of about JD 2.0 million.
6.12      The project includes a soyial development component accounting for
20% of project costs. While the so.Qial development component does not gene-
rate quantifiable benefits, it makes a substantial improvement in the lives
of project area residents, most of whom are small farmers. These; benefits
would be in the form of 150 new classrooms, three new health centers and an
extension of an existing one, domestic water supply, community centers and
institutional improvements.
Economic Return
6.13      The project's rate of return, costing hired labor at the market rate
of JD 1 and family labor at JD 0.75 per day is estimated at 24%. Sensitivity
tests show that a 25% increase in costs would reduce the rate of return to
18.9% and a 25% decrease in benefits would reduce it to 17.9%.  With both a
25% decrease in benefits and 25% increase on costs, the rate of return would
still be 14.5.  If the social development component is also excluded, the rate
of return would be 29%.  Details of the economic analysis are presented in
Annex 15.
6.14      Three factors have favorably influenced the economic rate of return.
First the project makes improvements in the already irrigated area which re-
quire relatively low incremental investment costs to unlock the productivity
potential of an existing irrigation system. Second, the presently unirrigated
area can be served by a gravity-powered sprinkler system thereby avoiding ex-
pensive operational costs. Third, the project strengthens the extension,
transportation, credit and marketing services which are weak at present.
E-mployment
6.15      The project is expected to increase direct employment from the pre-
sent 1.8 million man-days to 2.3 million man-days at full development. In
addition it would generate employment in the supply of inputs and grading,
packing, processing and marketing of project produce, estimated at about
100,000 mandays per year.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHEI) AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements Reached
7.01      Agreement was reached on the following main points:
(a)  The operational responsibility of grading and packing stations
located in North Shuneh and Wadi Yabis would be transferred
before September 30, 1974 to the Agricultural Marketing Or-
ganization, and AMO would, in consultation with IDA, transfer



- 28 -
the operating ono  ,naging re,ponsibility of assembly markets
and packing an6 grading stations to the Farmers Association
as soon as the latter's staff has been trained (paras. 4.11,
5.03, 5.09).
(b)  :-Oio-owiag ?roject completion, the Education and Health
Departmernts would provide adequate staff for efficient
operation and supervision of the education and health facil-
ities, including monitoring for malaria (paras. 4.33, 5.03).
(c) JVC would retain a firm of Consultants to design and super-
vise the construction of project irrigation and water supply
works. The firm would be employed in consultation with and
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.  JVC and NRA would
second counterpart staff to work with consultants for in-
service training. Expatriate specialists in grading and
marketing and accounting would be employed to assist AMO and
to train FA in the relevant fields of activity (paras. 5.04,
5.10).
(d) The membership of the Liaison and Advisory Committee and its
Terms of Reference would .ot be changed without IDA's concur-
rence (para. 5.05).
(e) The Agricultural Credit Corporation would (i) obtain project
credit funds from Government through JVC at not less than
4-1/4% to be repaid over a period of 15 years. The lending
rate to project farmers would not be less than 8% for seasonal
loans with 1% rebate for repayment on time, and 6% for medium-
term and long-term loans and (ii) maintain separate accounts
for project credit operations (para. 5.08).
(f)  The Government, commencing with the first year of irrigation
in the sprinkler-irrigated area and by not later than the third
year in the gravity-served areas, would recover a water charge
of not less than 6 fils/m3 which would be reviewed periodically
to ensure recovery of (i) full operation and maintenance costs
annually and (ii) entire investment costs with 5% interest
over the project life of 40 years (para. 5.15).
Condition for Effectiveness
7.02      Enactment of law establishing Farmers Association and election of
its Executive Board would be a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 5.06).
7.03      With the aforementioned agreement and fulfillment of condition of
effectiveness, the Project constitutes a suitable basis for a credit of
US$7.5 million to be repaid over 50 years including 10 years grace. The
borrower would be the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

JORDAN
NORTHEAST MOR IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agriculture
General
1.        Out of a total of 350,000 ha of arable land in Jordan only 25,000
ha are irrigated. The Jordan valley and its side Wadis cover 76% of all ir-
rigated lands. There are no possibilities to expand the cultivated area under
rainfed condition. Agricultural production can be increased significantly by
irrigating dry lands mainly in the Jordan valley and to a limited extent in
the desert. Water is the limiting factor in Jordan and agricultural develop-
ment should envisage more efficient use of water resources. The North East
Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project aims at improved water use ef-
ficiency and extended irrigation. It would Include 7700 ha presently irri-
gated by the East Ghor canal, the side Wadis or dry farmed (Table 1). It would
extend over 32 km from the Yarmouk river in t_he north to Wadis Yabis in the
South with its width varying between two and four kilometers. The altitude
decreases from -192 m in the north to about -230 m in the south.
Climate
2.        The climate of the project area is predominantly mediterranean with
local modifications resulting mainly from topography. The summers are dry
and hot while the winters are only moderately cool and wet. Precipitation
occurs in the winter months. Prevailing winds are from west and southwest but
periodically shift to the east and north. Relative humidity varies between
50% and 70%. (Table 2)
3.        Average monthly precipitation decreases from 380 mm in Adassiya to
about 300 mm per year at Wadi Yabis. Total rainfall shows a strong variation
from year to year ranging from 218 to 470 mm per year in a 15 year period.
The dry period may extend to 6 months but even during the rainy season sup-
plementary irrigation is required for most crops grown in the area.
Soils and Topography
4.        The soils in the Jordan valley were initially formned by lacustrian
marl sediments. This parent material was deposited when a lake covered the
valley during the early quaternary. As the lake retreated to the Dead Sea,
the Jordan river cut through forming its own flood plain and alluvial material
was deposited originating the Zor in the valley. The Ghor terraces were covered
with fluviated colluvial sediments which originated from the bordering uplands.



ANNEX I
Page 2
5.        rhe slopes of the project area towards the Jordan River vary from
0.2 to 1% in the Zor, from 1 to 3% in the lower Ghor and from 2 to 5% in the
upper Ghor.  The general slope north south is about 1%.  About 30% of the
nroject area because of topography would require sprinkler irrigation.  Most
of this land is concentrated in the tUpper Ghor adjacent to the East Ghor canal.
6.        In 1953/54 the Baker/Harza Company carried out a detailed survey,
resulting in a land classification for irrigated agriculture according to the
Standards of the Bureau of Reclamation, USA.  In 1964/65 the Institute of
Pedology and T'echnology, Zagreb made a special salinity and alkalinity survey
of the soils in the valley.  These surveys together with supplementary informa-
tion provided by Dar-Al Handassah Consulting Engineers, Beirut and Netherland
Engineering Consultants (Nedeco), the Hague, adequately picture the soil po-
tential indicating their suitability for growing a variety of crops. Soil
depth varies from 90 cm to several meters and most of the soils have moderate-
lv fine textures.
7.        Drainage problems only occur in isolated spots affecting a total
of about 725 ha. These areas require subsurface drainage for full develop-
ment, which is already being provided for 200 ha.
Present Land Use and Yields
8.        Out of 7700 ha only 6660 are irrigatted and 1040 dry farmed.  The
present overall cropping intensity is 99%. On irrigated land the cropping
intensity is about 106% and on dry land where wheat and fallow is inter-
changed the intensity averages about 50%. The cropped area totals 7600 ha
per year and present yields and production levels are given below. Vegetables
have been classified in early vegetables which are harvested between January
and June and obtain better average prices and late vegetables which are har-
vested between July and December.

9.        Present yields of vegetables and field crops are low because of in-
availability of suitable varieties, inefficient fertilization, plant protec-
tion measures and irrigation. Water is applied by wild flooding in cereals
and by zig-zag furrows in row crops. The zig-zag furrow method is labor
consuming and does not permit the use of machinery. As the farmer cannot
provide the required labor input, field:; are invaded vy weeds which compete
for water and nutrients and favor the spreading of pests and diseases. Citrus
production is presently affected by improper timing of irrigation, lack of
hedging, pests and diseases and deficiencies of minor elements. High tem-
peratures and hot dry winds cause deficiencies in fruit setting and have a
negative effect on yields. Banana yields are affected by frosts, cold weather
and nematodes.
Future Cultivation
10.       With the project a net area of 7700 ha will be irrigated.  The water
application efficiency will be improved by land leveling and introduction of
sprinkler irrigation. This will permit the use of straight furrows for row
crops and borders for cereals. For cultivation operations machinery will be
used which will properly time operations and better weed control and plant
protection measures. With adequate supporting services, use of good seeds,
correct amounts and types of fertilizers, timed applications of insecticides
and pesticides and improved irrigation methods, yields will increase as shown
below. Projection have taken into account eventual damages due to frosts and
low average temperatures. The cropping intensity will increase to 120% with
maize, squash and cucumber as main second crops. Growing conditions for maize
are very favorable as long as planted in early February or July to avoid polli-
nation in the hottest months. The irea planted with solanaceas will be reduced
from about 55% to 45% in order to permit a better control of nematodes.
11.       Citrus yields are expected to increase to 28 ton/ha mainly as a result
of better plant protection, timed irrigation and hedging. Banana yield will
increase due to better adapted varieties, improved water availability and plant
protection. Due to adverse low temperatures and occasional frosts in the win-
ter, yields will not be above 22 ton/ha. The expansion of orchards areas is
not envisaged. In addition to climatic constraints fruit trees are grown
under licenses and no new planting will be permitted as long as there are
areas short of water that can be successfully irrigated from the same system
in the valley.

Agricultural Research
12.       Agricultural Research in the project area was interrupted during
the Middle East crisis. A new research program has been started by the Minis-
try of Agriculture, Department of Research and Extension for the Jordan
Val.lev.  The project will sunport this program, whose main objectives are in-
crease of vields, reduction of production costs and production of quantities
and qualities which satisfy the marketing demands. The main experimental
station at Deir Alla does not represent the ecological conditions of the proj-
ect area. Therefore its substation at Wadi Yabis will be equipped and staff-
ed. The staff will be increased to 4 Agronomists specialized in horticulture,
friiitictulttire, field crops and plant protection, and 9 assistants (Table 3).
All research work will be coordinated with the extension service and other
related institutions active in the valley.
13.       The research program should include the following:
(1)  Introdiuction of new varieties, testing of their production
potential, disease resistance, cold resistance, shipping
and Processing quality and marketability.
(2)  Stujdies on time of planting in order to provide adequate
information for sound rotations and a cropping sequence to
coircide with the various market demands.



UaNEX 1
Page 5
(3) Studies on method of planting, optimum plant density and
spacing.
(4)  Fertilizer trials to establish optimum rates and to develop
sound criteria for fertil:zer recommendations based on soil
analysis.
(5) Water requirement trials.
(6) Study of production of off-season crops under plastic tunnels.
(7) Production-processing studies to improve the processing of
vegetable crops.
(8) Introduction of new potential crops to be grown in the area.
With respect to plant protection the station should be capable to identify
infected or infested plant specimens and to recommend control measures. Re-
search activities should include biological studies of insects, diseases and
nematodes, screening of varieties for disease and nematode resistance, test-
ing of chemicals to control insects diseases, nematodes and weeds.
14.       The current practice of seed multiplication on the experimental
farms and on private farms under close supervision of the research staff
will be continued. The Department of Research and Extension will sell the
seeds against cash or credit.
Agricultural Extension
15.       The Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Research and Extension
is responsible for agricultural extension in Jordan. With the project the
service will be improved by staffing, equipment and transportation facilities.
The extension work in the Jordan valley is coordinated by an Extension Super-
intendent stationed in Deir Alla. Fcr the project area a Supervisor would be
stationed in North Shuneh. The present staff of three agents all graduates
from agricultural schools would be increased to nine and the new recruits
would be university graduates. Their work would be backed by technical advise
of five subject matter specialists, which would be available on a part time
basis. They will be specialists in fieldcrops, vegetables, fruit trees, plant
protection and soils-irrigation. The extension offices would be located in
the community centers to be build under the project and make use of the faci-
lities available at the experimental station in Wadi Yabis and at the Voca-
tional School. A complete list of the staffing, equipment and transportation
provided under the project is shown in Table 3.
Vocational Training Center
16.       The Government plans to establish a Vocational Training Center in
the valley. The program consists (a) training of young farmers in a two-year
fulltime course in different agricultural activities, and (b) training of



ANNEX, 1
Page 6
farmers including owners, sharecroppers and farm labor in short practical
courses to be programmed in accordance to the necessities and nature of the
agricultural circumstances in the area. The project would benefit mainly
from the second objective and therefore includes classrooms, workshops and
equipment for the training center to be established at Wadi Yabis (Table 4).
It is assumed that professionals of different relevant institutions will par-
tLcipate in the preparation and implementation of the courses.
FAO raining Program
17.       UNDP with FAO as executing agency is carryihg out an assistance
program for agricultural field research and extension services. The project
started in December 1, 1972 and has a duration of five years. This project
contributes to the agricultural development process of the project area.
Its main objective is to strengthen the capacities of the Department of
Research and Extension, to plan and conduct applied research and assist the
extension services and to train staff in development activities. Strength-
ening of these capacities will increase the departments abilities to respond
to the demand of better agricultural advise and service in the project area.
UNDP inputs include three permanent foreign advisors, (research and extension
programnmir;g expert, research specialist, extension expert), plus short-term
consultants. In view of this assistance, no further foreign expertise would
be provided under the project to support the agricultural services.

/1   10 dunums = 1 ha.
2.        Jordanian Law (No. 12, 1968) requires that land holdings in govern-
ment developed irrigation areas cannot be less than 30 dunums of class I and
II land and 50 dunums of class III land. The maximum holding in such irri-
gated areas cannot exceed 200 dunums. There are no size restrictions on un-
irrigated areas.
3.        A social and economic survey of the East Jordan Valley carried out
in February/March 1973 indicated that 88% of the holdings in the project area -
85% of the area - are within the range of 30 to 60 dunums. The details of
ownership are in Table I, a summary of which is given below:

which slightly raises the average size of holding. Data for the irrigated
portion of the project area from the National Resource Authority (NRA) land

records show even greater concentration of holdings in the size range between
30 and 50 dunums. According to the NRA land records only 11 holdings reach
or are near the 200 dunum maximum.

is the dominant form of farm operation in the project area, and is fairly uni-
fprrlv distributed among holdings of all sizes, with the largest number of
stiarecropners (lgP) an(d area sharecropped (5,553 dunums) in holdings of from
26-30 dutnums. The largest concentration of area is in farm holdings of 101-150

JORDAN
NORTHEAST GHOR IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Description of Project Works
General
1.        The project area, located on the east bank of the Jordan river, is
bounded by the Yarmouk river in the north, the foothills of the Jordanian
plateau in the east and Wadi Yabis in the south (Map 10746R). The project
consists of the following main components:
(a)  Main Works:  development of 7,700 ha net, by providing
irrigation to a new area of 1,040 ha, improving existing
irrigation in the other 6,660 ha and improving technical
and supporting services in the.project area;
(b) Minor Works: development of the area by either providing
new or improving the existing facilities in respect of
drinking water, health, education, ttansportation and com-
munity development.
Agricultural and Rural Development
2.        Main Works.  The proposed works for providing irrigation to the new
area and improving existing irrigation (Map 10746R) are:
(a) two diversion weirs on Wadis Arab and Jurum;
(b) primary and secondary pipelines about 55 km long to
convey, under adequate pressure created by gravity,
the waters of wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum to 2,760 ha
to be served by sprinkler irrigation;
(c) a distribution network to convey irrigation supplies from
the primary pipeline to field outlets for irrigating 2,760 ha;
(d) about 30 km of farm roads to serve the area to be irrigated
above the East Ghor Canal;
(e) landleveling in about 3,000 ha currently irrigated by the East
Ghor Canal;
(f) tile drains serving about 520 ha;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(g) rehabilitation works on East (Ghor Canal; and
(h)  assembly of tro market centers.
3.        Diversion Weirs.  The weir on Wadi Arab, and also the weir on Wadi
Jurum, would divert the wadi water to a silting reservoir, located adjacent
to each weir, where the suspended silt load would be allowed to settle. Clear
water would then enter the primary pipeline. The weirs would be so located
that adequate pressure would build up in the pipeline by gravity and a pres-
sure of at least 3-1/2 atmospheres would be available at the field outlets.
The weirs would be about 15-20 m long anc would be founded on solid rock.
No weir on silting reservoir would be required on Wadi Ziglab, as the outlet
works on the existing storage dam would provide silt-free water to the primary
pipeline under adequate pressure.
4.        Primary and Secondary Pipelines.  The primary and secondary pipe-
lines, about 55 km long, would be aligned along the foothills in the east,
generally along the (-) 195 m contour. It would extend from a point 8 km
south of Wadi Jurum to about 8 km north of Wadi Arab and would receive the
water supply from Wadis Jurum, Ziglab and Arab through three short pipelines
conveying water from the diversion weirs (Wadis Arab and Jurum) and the dam
(VWadi Ziglab). These pipelines pressurized by gravity due to difference in
water elevations, would serve a part of the project area (2,760 ha) by sprink-
ler irrigation. One or two secondary lines would take off at suitable points
and extend westward, across the East Ghor Canal, to serve about 1,000 ha by
sprinkers, which lies below the canal. Both the primary and the secondary
lines would be of asbestos cement.
5,        Distribution Network.  The distribution network would consist of
hut.4d tertiary pipes, farm outlets and farm mainline pipes. The tertiary
Tipes would take off directly either from the primary pipeline or, as in the
iase of East Ghor Canal area, from the secondary pipeline and would be rather
shnrt in length as the width of land to be served by sprinkler irrigation
mostl- varIes froni 200 n to 1,000 m.  The tertiary pipes would be spaced about
- ¢ r apart and would be aligned perpendicular to the natural slope.  Depend-
lii, tX:.on the width of the area, farm outlets, generally in pairs, Vould be
ertlvited on these pipes at a spacing of about 180 m.  Each outlet, equipped
1.rt't  a meter, would serve one farm through a farm mainline pipe, which would
" buLried along the farm boundary, with sprinkler risers provided at every
m.  The sprinkler lines would be arranged by the farmers themselves through
credit.
6.        The sprinkler system would be designed to furnish a maximum of 0.56
1/sec/ha, at a pressure of at least 3 atmospheres at the sprinklers. This
supply rate would meet the peak demand, which occurs in October, on the basis
of 24 hours per day irrigation.



iANLIMX 3
Page 3
i.        The on farm portable equipment for the area to be provided with
sprinkler irrigation would be procured by NRA znd paid on credit by the far-
mer.  The lavout of the on farm system would be standardized by the consult-
ants for farms of various sizes and shapes.  The project extension staff would
advise and assist the farmers in working out the requirements of the on farm
equipment.
8.        Farm Roads.  Farm roads already exist in the East Ghor Canal area
and new roads would be provided only in the area above the Canal. Farm roads
would be spaced about 450 m apart and would be 5 m wide.  The central 3 m
width of the roads would be surfaced by gravel. The total length of the new
road construction would be about 30 km.
9.        Land Leveling.  Below the East Ghor Canal, the project area has a
general slope of 1 to 3%, whereas above the Canal the slopes are somewhat
steeper. No land grading was carried out in the East Ghor area wnen canal
irrigation was introduced, although most of the area needs some earth-moving
to make it suitable for surface irrigation. Currently, in the absence of
grading, irrigation is carried out through zigzag furrows instead of straight
fturrows. This practice is limiting the growth of irrigation intensity. Under
the project land grading would be carried out in those area, which are not
being converted to sprinkler irrigation. In such areas, estimated as 3,000
ha, the quantity of earth to be moved would vary from 200 m3 to 750 m3 per
ha, with an average of about 300 m3 per ha. Small quantities of land grading
in local pockets would also be necessary in the new area above the East Ghor
Canal.
10.       Tile Drainage.  Due to lack of local drainage, about 725 ha of East
Ghor area, in several non-contiguous blocks, are affected by water logging.
Most of these areas have already gone out of cultivation. Some of the affect-
ed blocks lie in those areas which would be converted into sprinkler irriga-
tion under the project and drainage facilities would not be required*; In the
remaining blocks, estimated at 520 ha, tile drains would be constructed to
provide local drainage systems, which would discharge the effluent into the
existing open drains.
11.       Rehabilitation Works on East Ghor Canal.  In the head reach of the
East Chor Canal, large quantities of sediments are brought into the Canal by
a hill torrent, which inlets into the Canal. In this reach, some high slopes
also drain directly into the Canal. Under the project, an over-chute would
he constructed for the torrent. Adjacent to the high slopes, the Canal bank
would be widened and a drain would be provided at the foot of the slopes,
which would discharge the surface runoff into the nearby culvert under the
Canal. Other minor works, all for the improvement of surface drainage, would
also be carried out in this reach.
12.       Assembly Markets and Packing and Grading Stations.  There are two
grading and packing stations at Wadi Yabis and North Shuneh. Both are pro-
vided with more equipment and facilities than it has been possible to use.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Facilities for assemblv markets would be provided adjacent to these stations,
so that the need for additional storage and office buildings would be reduced.
TIt would also ensure, with minor repairs and adaptation, the use of the grading
ard nacking facilities which have hitherto been practically unused. Moreover,
supervision and management would be more efficient and less costly for the
complementary operations of marketing, packing and grading.
Minor Works
13.       The proposed works for social development facilities would include:
(a) domestic water supply to about ten villages;
(b) construction of three new health centers, and improve-
ment and additions to an existing health center;
(c) construction of about 150 schoolrooms;
G(!) construction of a vocational training center;
(e) construction of ten community development centers; and
(f) improvements to and regravelling of about 60 km of
roads;
14.       Domestic Water Supplv.  Drinking water supplv would be made available
to about 60 project villages. At present only a part of one of these villages
is provided with piped water supply. Water intended for this use would be
filtered and chlorinated.  It would then be piped to the villages and other
smaller settlements along the north-south main road. Within each village,
several communitv taps would be provided in the streets at 8uitable locations.
15.       Health Centers.  The existing health center at North Shuneh would be
enlarged by additions to the existing building, and would be converted into a
field lhospital. It would consist of an outpatient's block, x-ray and dentistry
facilities, a small, laboratory and about 8 beds. A resident doctor, a dentist,
a nuirse and a midwife would be on its regular staff. Smaller health centers
would he constructed at Adasiya, Waqqas and Mashare.  Each of these three cen-
ters would be attended bv a doctor, a nurse and a midwife.  All four centers
would be provided with necessary equipment, instruments and furniture. An
ambulance and a vehicle, to be stationed at North Shuneh, would be furnished
to transnort emergency medical and surgical cases from this project area to
the nearest hospital at Trbid.
16f.      Schoolrooms.  Except for North Shuneh, none of the villages in the
prniect area has its school in a proper building.  Tinder the project, a total
of abouit 150 schoolrooms and ancillary facilities would be constructed to
nroviTdo .The recuiired numher of elementary and preparatory schools in the area.
The exact number of schoolrooms to be constructed in each village would be



ANNEX 3
Page 5
determined by the Mlinistrv of Education and JVC. Furniture and equipment re-
quired by the new sehools would be provided under the project.
17.       Vocational Training Center.  Two lecture halls, and a workshop with
a store would be built at the field r-esearch and extension station at Wadi
Yabis.  The total area of these builcings, which w?uld be mainly used for the
training of Drolect farmers would be ahout 1,000 m . Educational aids includ-
inr, farm machinery, tools, and equipment would also be provided.
18.       Community Center.  Ten community centers would be constructed in the
project villages. Each of these centers would have a total area of 100 m2
with three main rooms. These centers would be used as the headquarters for
the extension agent and the local office of the Farmer's Association. These
centers would also be used as farmer education centers. Furniture and equip-
ment for educational aids would be furnished under the project.
19.       Roads.  Farm roads along the laterals of the East Ghor Canal and a
road along the Canal already exist. A dirt road connecting the main valley
road and the Ziglab Dam also exists.  Under the project, the road to Ziglab
Dam would be asphalted and the farm roads along irrigation laterals would be
improved and regravelled where necessary. The road along the Canal would
also be improved where necessary.

NOPTITEAST GHOR IRPIGATION AND RIJRAL. DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assembly Markets and Packing and Grading Stations
1.        There are two Packing and grading stations in the project area -
one in the northern part of the area at North Shuneh and one at the southern
end at Wadi Yahis, 22 km apart. These stations were established in 1966.
Each has a large, well constructed building in a good location with a variety
of other equipment and facilities. Originally both buildings were equipped
with grading lines. The grading line in North Shuneh - washing, waxing and
multinle grading for citrus - is in good condition but has been used little.
The equipment in Wadi Yabis - vegetable grading - has been largely dismantled.
Neither station has fully operated, partly because of the 1967 war and the
guerrilla activities until 1970 and partly due to inadequate management, poor
organization and the absence of a demonstrated need for, or profitability of,
grading.
2.        There are no public assembly markets in the project area, although
two small private ones operate during the winter season farther south in the
valley - one in Karameb and one in Saoualha. This project includes the es-
tablishment of two assembly markets associated with and adjoining each of
the existing packing and grading stations.
3.        The 1973 government plan for the entire valley calls for the estab-
lishment of three assembly markets at Wadi Yabis, Maadi and South Shuneh.
The latter two are 35 and 75 km south of the project area. Preliminary de-
signs and estimates for these markets have been developed by the Agricultural
Marketing Organization (AIlO) and the Government. Each market is designed
to handle 400 tons/day with peak period loads of 800 tons/day. Although a
market at North Shuneh was earlier considered, the expectation of slower
development in the North Ghor area (prior to preparation of this project)
resulted in its being dropped.
4.        Originally (1972) the assembly markets pronosed for the valley were
modest, covering 1 ha., providing no storage facilities and costing from
JD 16 to 20 thousand. Subsequently (1973) revised plans called for a larger
market area covering 3 ha and including a shed for storage, raising the cost
to JD 43,000 (Table 1).
5.        An advantage claimed by the Government for the Wadi Yabis locatior
(which applies equally if not more to North Shuneh) is that it would not re-
quire a storage shed (the most costly item in the market) since the eVisting
unused packing and grading building was larger (approximately 2,400 m-) than
the proposed shed (1,600 m2).



ANNEX 4
Page 2
6.        The assembly markets proposed for this project are based on modifi-
cations of the Government's designs and the flow of produce, and take into ac-
count the facilities which already exist.
Assemblyv Markets - Wadi Yabis and North Shuneh
7.        The existence of packing houses at both locations would reduce the
need for new storage and office space. However, since the project would
utilize the packing and grading facilities separate sheds for storage at each
of the two markets would be constructed. The cost to establish these two
assembly markets are itemized in Table 2.
Packing and Grading Stations
8.        The packing houses at both North Shuneh and Wadi Yabis are well
constructed and in good condition. No significant costs should be involved
beyond normal upkeep. The grading line at North Shuneh is in good working
order but may reouire some simple repairs. Similar equipment for vegetables
at Wadi Yabis has been partially dismantled as parts were removed which could
he sold. The existin,! line would be adapted as a simple conveyor, since there
is no demonstrated nee( for more sophisticated equipment.  The North Shuneh
station also has two small tractors for moving heavy loads inside the build-
irm, neither have been used.
9.        JD 10,000 would be needed for the adaptation of the grading line at
W4adi Yabis or its replacement with simple conveyor belts, and for acquisition
of basic equipment, such as hand trucks, tables, etc. at both stations:
Iterl                                    Cost JD         US$

10.       Table 3 shows the monthly and daily tonnages of fruits and vege-
tables which are produced now and will be produced in the project area at
full development.
11.       Table 4 shows the net daily marketable supply of fruits and vege-
tables in the project area at full production. The net marketable supply
was derlved from the total daily production as follows:



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(a) the 1973 project area population, excluding Wadi Yabis was
about 25,000 (28,062 - 3,186 (Wadi Yabis) = 24,886).
(b) Population growth rate assumed 2.8%, higher than present
rate in the project area. The population in the project
area in 1983 would thus be 33,000.
(c) Per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables in Jordan
in 1970 is estimated by FAO a£t follows:
Commodity                                 Kg/per capita/year
Fruits                                           130
of which citrus and bananas                     30
Vegetables                                       144
(d) Following quantities are assumed to be consumed from the
Project production:
Citrus and bananas                        30 kg/per capita/year
Vegetables                               120 kg/per capita/year
(e) Waste and field losses for fruit are assumed to be 5% and for
vegetables 10%.
(f)  Based on these assumptions the daily and annual consumption
of fruits and vegetables in the project area would be as
follows:
Total Consumption
Commodity             Year             Daily               Annual
----tons----
Vegetables            1973             10.0                3,650
Vegetables            1983             14.0                5,110
Fruits                1973              2.1                  770
Fruits                1983              2.8                1,020
13.       After deducting field losses and self consumption in the project
area, an allowance was made for produce moving through the project area mar-
kets, primarily Wadi Yabis, from outside the project area. The Wadi Yabis
market is at the extreme southern boundary of the project area. The next
nearest market would be 35 km south. It is assumed that at least 1/2 as
much produce will pass through the Wadis Yabis market from the area im-
mediately south as from the project area itself. This will be primarily
vegetables.
14.       Since the Farmers Association Law stipulates that all produce in
the project area will pass through the assembly markets, Table 6 indicates



ANNEX 4
Page 4
that this flow would not exceed the peak capacity of these two markets
(,,600 tons daily, or 800 tons daily per market). The flow of produce is
likely to come close to this level only during May and June. For most of the
year the markets will operate at 300 to 400 tons/day, the level of operation
for which they were designed.
Staffing and Operating Costs of Assembly Markets
and Packing and Grading Stations
15.       The staff for the two assembly markets would consist of the follow-

16.       The staff for the packing and grading station would consist of:
Staff                                                      Monthly Salary
2 Technicians (one each station, 2 x 70 JD)                   140 JD

20 Packers (ten each station, 20 x 30 JD)                     600 JD
980 JD
The capacity of each station is 40 tons/day or 1,000 tons/month. Since there
have been sporadic experiments but no full scale packing and grading opera-
tions at any of the three packing and grading stations in Jordan, this ele-
ment of the activity would be phased and the full staff strength would be
reached at the end of the third year for six months a year.

Phasing and Costs of Employment
17.       Table 5 gives the phasing of employment and costs for the assembly
r'arl-ets ?nd packing and grading stations during the first three years of the
project.  The construction works and equipping of the markets and packing
houses would be completed in about 6 months. The markets would be ready to
co.mnence operation in October 1975. At that time however the project would
not as yet hrave nixch impact on the production. Therefore the flow of produce
through the markets would be essentially as indicated in the "present" situa-
tion in Table 3.
18.       During the initial years of the operation of the markets auctioneers
and much of the labor would be provided by the project, unlike Armman where
cormmission agents are well established and employ the auctioneers and much
of the labor.  This would ensure success of the operation.
Financing of the Operations
19.       The assembly markets and packing and grading stations would not
onlv he self supporting but would also return an income.  A fee of one per-
cent of gross marketings would be charged. During the earlv years of opera-
tion approximately 80,000 tons would flow through the two markets.  At full
operation the annual tonnage flowing through the two markets would be 200,000
tons, including that from outside the project area (Table 4) but excluding
project area consumption and 5% waste for fruits and 10% for vegetables.  At
an average farmgate price of JD 30/ton and a fee of 1% (half that charged
at the Amman wholesale market) this would generate annual revenues of JD
24,000 in the early vears, rising to JTD 60,000 by 1983.
20.       Tlhe packing and grading stations have a capacity of 40 tons per
day for each station.  At full capacity about 12,000 tons would be handled
in a six month operation. An average price of JD 45/ton for graded and well
packed fruit would yield JD 540,000. A packing and grading fee of 5%, which
would include the costs of packaging, would produce JD 27,000 in revenue
annuallv.
21.       Difficulties are expected initially in reaching assumed levels of
Performance, but by 1983, when the project would be in full operation, these
fees would produtce incomes of J1) 80 to 90,000 per year. Allowing for annual
operating costs of 20,000 - packing materials, boxes, etc. - JD 10,000 for
depreciation and JD 21,000 for staff costs, which would total about JD 51,000,
an operating surplus of nearly JD 40,000 would remain.  This could be returned
to Farmers Association (FA) members as dividends or used to expand the opera-
tions of the assemblv markets and packing and grading stations.

Organization and Consultants
Jordan Valley Commission
1.        Xhe headquarters organization of JVC would consist of a President
(also the Director General), a Deputy Director General and four directorates,
each of which would be headed by a Director. These directorates would deal
with (a) irrigation, drainage and farm roads; (b) agriculture, marketing and
credit; (c) town planning, housing, public services and highways; and (d) ad-
ministration and financial management. In addition an officer, directly re-
porting to the Deputy Director General, would deal with social and community
development aspects. JVC will be assisted in its task by a Liaison and Ad-
visory Committee (LAC), which consists of senior representatives of various
agencies that.are directly involved in the project execution. Organization
of JVC and LAC is illustrated in Chart 8380. The Law establishing JVC is
attached as an enclosure to this Anrex.
2.        JVC would also establish a field office at Deir Alla, which is lo-
cated in the central part of the Valley, outside the project area. This
office, assisted by the headquarters staff, would broadly supervise all
field activities of the various executing agencies in the whole Valley, in-
cluding the project area. Cost of JVC headquarters staff and its field of-
fice would be met by the three development projects in the Valley; the IDA
project would pay for one-third of the costs.
Consultants
3.        Irrigation Works.  The irrigation works constitute about 70% of
the project works and include two diversion weirs and siltation reservoirs,
a sprinkler irrigation system to serve about 1,760 ha above and about 1,000
ha below the East Ghor Canal, farm roads to serve the area to be irrigated
above the East Ghor Canal, land levelling in about 3,000 ha and tile drain-
age of about 520 ha out of the area irrigated by the East Ghor Canal, and
some works on the East Ghor Canal. These works would be included in one
construction contract. Out of the minor development works the filtration
and chlorination of the domestic water supply and installation of pipes
conveying the treated water to the villages would also be included in the
contract for irrigation works.
4.        Jordan has neither the experience nor the staff to design and
supervise the construction of the above works. Therefore, an experienced
consulting firm would be employed by JVC to assist NRA in the design of
these works and for supervision of their construction. This firm would
also train the local engineers and other technical staff in design, con-
struction, operation and maintenance of these works. The proposed terms



ANNEX 6
Page 2
of reference for this consulting firm, for the aforementioned works, are
summarized below:
(i) carry out surveys, investigations and tests necessary to
prepare detailed designs;
(ii)  prepare detailed designs, contract drawings, technical
specifications and other contract documents for the con-
struction contract;
(iii)  evaluate bids and make recommendations for award of the
-onstruction contract;
(iv)  administer the construction contract, approve contractor's
work schedules, verify work performed each month and certify
payments due;
(v) check layout of works and supervise their construction in
all respects;
(vi)  prepare instructions for operation and maintenance of the
works;
(vii)  prepare specifications and contract documents for the pro-
curement of project equipment and materials;
(viii)  assist JVC in analysis of bids for equipment supply contract,
make recommendations for its award and administer this con-
tract after award;
(ix)  verify deliveries under the equipment supply contract and
certify payments due; and
(x) train local engineers and other technical staff seconded
for this purpose in design, construction, operation and
maintenance of the irrigation works.
The consulting firm would prepare for JVC quarterly and annual progress reports,
as directed.
5.       The consulting firm would appoint an experienced engineer to head
its project team in Jordan. Other experienced engineers and experts would
be employed by the firm, as necessary, in accordance with work requirements.
The estimated manpower requirement of the firm is given in Table 1. As nec-
essary, local engineers and other staff would be seconded by JVC and NRA to
work with the consulting firm, to receive in-service training on design, con-
struction supervision and operation and maintenance of the irrigation works.

NORTHEAST GHOR IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Water Demand, Supply and Quality
Water Demand
1.        Water requirements of crops have been estimated using the Blaney
Criddle method with modified crop factors. The mean temperature was calculated
by taking half the sum of the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures at North
Shuneh. The percentage of day time hours as percentage of the year correspond-
ing to 320 latitude North has been used. Effective rainfall was assumed to
be 65% of precipitation from 75 to 100 mm per month, 82% of precipitation
between 50 and 75/mm, 90% of precipitation between 25 and 50/mm, and 95% of
precipitation between 10 and 25 mm; less than 10 mm per month was ignored.
Crop factors recommended by Blaney Criddle and the US Soil Conservation Serv-
ice were adjusted for stage of growth and average prevailing temperature.
For all crops planted in the dry season a preirrigation of 60 mm was added.
2.        Average water requirements are low because the main growing seasons
coincide in part with the period of precipitation. Demand is highest in the
months of August, September and October, when net water requirements average
between 850 and 1,130 m3/ha, Table 1.
3.        With the project, water requirements will increase mainly because
of 1,040 ha additional land and a higher cropping intensity, which will in-
crease from 106% to 120% on irrigated land. Assuming a 65% and 80% irriga-
tion efficiency respectively for gravity and sprinkler systems and based on
the proposed development schedule and cropping pattern the gross irrigation
requirements would be as below:

Water Supply
4.        The Yarmouk River and The East Ghor Canal.  Currently 6,660 ha is
being irrigated in the project area (7,700 ha), of which 5,940 ha receive its
water supply from the Yarmouk river through the East Chor Canal and 720 ha is
irrigated by the local use of the waters of Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum.
The remaining 1,040 ha, rainfed at present, would be brought under irrigation
under the project.  The Yarmouk river, with a catchment of 6,800 km2, has an
average annual flow of 438 Mm3, varying from a minimum of 240 Mm3 to a maximum
of 870 Mm3. Its monthly flows have been recorded since 1928. The East Ghor
Canal offtakes from the river near Adasiya and flows in a general north-south
direction. It has a capacity of 20 m3/sec and an existing length of 78 km,
of which the first 38 km lies in the project area.
5.        At present, according to Nedeco (The Hague) and Dar Al-Handasah
(Lebanon), the average annual water use in the Valley is about 15,830 m3/ha.
Under the project, about 1,000 ha of the East Ghor Canal area would be con-
verted into sprinkler irrigation using the waters of Wadis Arab, Ziglab and
Jurum (para. 4), and the other 4,940 ha would continue under gravity irriga-
tion from the Canal. On the basis of the recommended cropping pattern, the
gross average annual water demand for gravity irrigation of 4,940 ha, esti-
mated as 11,210 mr/ha (Table 1) would be about 55.3 Mm3 against its present
use of about 78.2 Mm3.
6.        Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum.  These three perennial Wadis originate
from the plateau and are fed by deep springs. Apart from the Yarmouk and
Zarqa rivers, these Wadis are the most important eastern tributaries of the
Jordan river. With the completion of the East Ghor Canal in 1965, the surplus
flou- of these wadis, after local irrigation use (720 ha) is inlet to the canal.
@Flow records of Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum are available from 1928, but are
irtcomplete between 1963 and 1971. Therefore, for project purposes only ten
ve4rs continuous dates prior to 1962-63, presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4, have
been considered. Flow in these wadis is rather steady with slight monthly
variations ard surface flow contribution, due to winter rainfall, is small.
Thie a;erage annual base flow of Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum is respectively
31.8  mi.3, 10.6 Mm3 and 11.2 Mm3.  A dam with storage capacity of 4.3 Mm3 exists
on 'ladt Z.glab and the construction of a dam on Wadi Arab, under Japanese bi-
_Werral aid, is under consideration.
Under the project, about 2,760 ha would be irrigated by a sprinkler
system from the combined waters of Wadis Arab, Ziglab and Jurum, of which
1,760 ha lie above and about 1,000 ha below the East Ghor Canal. On the
basis of the recommended cropping pattern, the gross average annual water
demand for this area, estimated at 9,112 m3/ha (Table 1), would be 25.1 Mm3,
against the present use of about 27.9 Mm3. The combined annual availability
of supplies from the three wadis, without taking into account the regulation
at either the existing Ziglab dam or the future Arab dam, varies from a
minimum of 35.4 MO3 to a maximum of 71.1 Mm3, with an average of 53.5 MO3.

8.        At present the irrigated pairt (6,660 ha) of the project area is
using about 105.4 Mm3 of water annua:ly from the Yarmouk river and the three
wadis. After the project, the total annual water demand for the project area
(7,700 ha), from these sources, would be about 80.4 MO3. Even after bring-
ing 1,040 ha of new area under irrigation and improving the intensity of ir-
rigation from 106% to 120% on 6,660 ha, the project would result in an esti-
mated annual saving of about 25 Mm3 of water.
Water Quality
9.        The National Resources Authority is responsible for the water qual-
ity control in the valley. Numerous analysis of the different waters have
been made and the results are shown in Table 5. In general waters are satis-
factory for irrigation. The quality of the water varies inversely with the
discharge, consequently improves significantly in the winter. It would fur-
ther improve after storage facilities planned upstream from the East Ghor
Canal intake on the Yarmouk River become available because of mixing of summer
and winter flows. According to the United States Department of Agriculture-
Salinity Laboratory Standards the waters would be classified as C2S1 with
mediunm salinity and very low sodium or alkali hazard. Such waters are suit-
able for irrigation when the drainage requirements are met. Sensitive crops
like lemons, oranges, and eggplants are already grown successfully in irri-
gated project areas.

NORTHEAST GHOR IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit and Marketing
Credit
1.        Existing Facilities.  The major source of seasonal credit (cash
and in kind) in the project area is commission agents. The Agricultural
Credit Corporation (ACC) which has received IDA credits in the past, has
gained considerable experience and expanded its operations which, however,
are still small in the project area. Its loans in the project area (north of
Wadi Yabis) have risen from JD 15,000 in 1970 to JD 141,000 in 1972 and JD
124,000 during the first half of 1973. The ACC has a branch office at Wadi
Yabis with a staff of seven. During 1972, 21% of its loans in the project
area were seasonal, the balance was medium- and long-term. All ACC loans are
secured by land or fixed property, and are not made to sharecroppers or ten-
ants.
2.        The Jordan Cooperative Societies, which prior to 1967 had concent-
rated their activities in the West Bank, are weak in the project area. There
are 12 small thrift and credit societies, sore of which are 20 to 25 years
old but have part of their assets frozen. The two packing and grading sta-
tions in the area have been nominally under the supervision of the Jordan
Cooperative Organization but failed to operate most of the time partly due
to insufficient management or supervision. Credit supplied by Cooperative
Societies to the area is limited and about a third of its loans are in kind.
These society are accustomed to deal with groups rather than individual far-
mers and considers that credit operations can only succeed if subsidized.
3.        There is thus a major seasonal credit deficit in the region which
is now supplied partially by commission agents and ACC. Sharecroppers (60%
of all farmers) borrow from commission agents or land owners at rates above
the 8% charged by ACC (7% if paid on due date), but since commission agents
also supply inputs and market most of the produce of the area, the real in-
terest charged by commission agents can not be accurately determined.
4.        Future Credit Requirements.  After the project, farmers would re-
quire medium-term loans for on-farm sprinkler equipment and seasonal loans
for incremental annual production costs to attain the expected yield levels.
JD 852,000 including contingencies and representing 80% of the total credit
requirements, have been provided in the project.
5.        ACC has demonstrated its ability to expand its lending activities
satisfactorily when it has adequate funds. It has also indicated willingness
to work through the Farmers Association (FA) in distributing the loans to

farmers in the project area and main.ain separate accounts for these activi-
ties. Under these conditions ACC would be willing to make direct loans to
individual farmers and sharecroppers.
6.        A subsidiary loan agreement will be signed stipulating that Govern-
ment will lend to ACC, through JVC, JD 800,000 at an interest rate of 4-1/4%.
AkCC will on-lend to project farmers at its existing rates of 8% for seasonal
loans, 7% if repaid on time, and 6% for medium-term loans. This will permit
ACC a margin of about 2-3/4% on the average for project loans and loan col-
lection through AMO and FA will assist ACC in improving its loan collection
record. The lending rate to ACC and the on-lending rate to farmers would
both be about 1% higher than the rates in the last IDA credit to Jordan for
ACC. Although commercial credit terms are undoubtedly higher than ACC rates,
commission agent practices obscure the effective rate of interest of commer-
cial credit. Despite the higher interest rates of commercial credit, it
would be impractical for ACC lending rates for project loans to be out of
line withi other ACC loans. The rate of inflation in Jordan during 1970-72
was relatively low, 2% per year. Although it appears to have increased in
1973, the rate of increase is not yet accurately measured and farm product
prices have not risen substantially.
Marketing
7.        In the second year of the project (1975 winter season) all crops
would pass through the two assembly markets which would be operated by the
Agricultural lHarketing Organization (AMO), with staff provided by the project.
A4tO has worked with the UNDP agricultural Marketing project for the past
three years and has developed much knowledge about the problems and possi-
bilities involved in marketing, grading and packing. It has also developed
knowledge about the nature of Jordan's major markets and what is needed to
improve the competitiveness of Jordan's fruits and vegetables in these markets.
W4hen the FA is able to take over the operations of the assembly markets the
management and the trained staff will pass from AMO to the Farmers Associa-
tion. The operational rights of the packing and grading stations, would be
Y ~irlv transferred to AMO, and the stations would be prepared for operation
an~i re-equipped (ANNEX 4) in order to commence trial packing and grading oper-
ations. These stations and their staff would also be transferred to the FA
when it is able to manage their operation.
S.        Provision is made in the project for a full-time specialist to
supervise the operation of the assembly markets and packing and grading sta-
tions for three years in addition to specialist services for shorter periods.
The specialist would help in marketing fruits and vegetables, concentrating
in the first year on initial field sorting jointly with the extension ser-
vice and training of staff at the markets and packing houses. In the second
year his major concern would be development of the domestic and neighboring
markets for project area produce. His third year would be devoted to devel-
oping other markets such as Europe, for specially graded, packed and shipped
fruits and vegetables.



ANNEX 12

9.        The role of ACC, MxO and FA in the provision of credit and market-
ing would be expanded under the project to ensure that the close link between
the provision of expanded services, increased production and improved market-
ing is maintained, thereby ensuring success of the project and equitable dis-
tribution of its benefits to all farmers, especially smaller farmers, the
majoritv of whom are sharecroppers. The presert provision of credit, inputs
and marketing services by commission agents and large farmers (often the
same persons) works to the disadvantage of the smaller farmers and share-
croppers. The extent of this disadvantage is difficult to quantify because
of the disguised elements of costs and prices prevailing in such a system --
sharecroppers can not obtain loans directly and their produce is marketed
against payments for credit and inputs.
10.       Competition among commission agents is limited in the project area
and their main concern appears to be with transactions outside the project
area -- profits in the Amman or Irbid wholesale markets or in foreign markets.
As a result, efficient and low cost provision of services in the project area
ancl earlv preparation of produce for market at the farm or project area level
has been retarded, and incentives to improve production and marketing to be-
nefit the project area have lagged.
11.       The project's reliance on ACC,, AMO and FA is designed to inject
new services into the project area to ensure competitive operations in the
areas of credit, input supply and marketing. Beyond the primary markets it
is expected that the private sector, commission agents and others, will con-
tinue to perform the marketing and transport services they presently perform.
The private sector is also not prohibited from continuing its activities in
the provision of credit and inputs. An element of competition is simply
introduced into both types of activities with emphasis placed on maximizing
the benefits in the project area and especially those obtained by its smaller
farmers. Since the produce leaving the project area would double by 1983
the demand for the services of the private sector would therefore substantial-
lv increase. The institutions relied on, ACC and AMO, appear to be the best
available for introducing this kind of competition and carrying out these
activities.

Farmgate Prices
1.        Farmgate prices in the project area were derived from Amman whole-
sale market prices (Table 1) with the following deductions:
Commission agent fee                       5%
Market fee                                 2%
Transport cost                             1.5 fils/kg
Field boxes
Tomatoes                                 2 fils/kg
Others                                   1 fil/kg
2.        One wooden field box costs 80 fils and holds 20 kgs of vegetables.
Each box on average can be used four times. The average cost per trip, per
box of 20 kgs is thus 20 fils, or 1 fil/kg.
3.        Tomatoes receive more care and therefore better boxes are used.
On this basis the box cost per kg for tomatoes was doubled to 2 fils/kg.
4.        Cost of sacks for dried onions and potatoes amount to 1 fil/kg
per trip.
5.        Cost of transport from the Northeast Ghor area to Amman (70 to
100 km) is reported as JD 10 to 1l per truck. Average loads range from
10 to 15 tons. The higher range of 1.5 fils/kg has been used.
6.        The above deductions were based on field discussions in the proj-
ect area and at the Amman wholesale market, and correspond to information
contained in the following reports of the UNDP Agricultural Marketing Proj-
ect in Jordan;
(a) Preliminary Note on the Establishment of Assembly Markets,
Grading and Packing Centers for Fresh Horticultural Com-
modities in the Jordan Valley (Report 2/73).
(b) Pre-feasibility Study - Assembly - Sorting - Grading and
Packing Stations (August 1972).
7.        The derived farmgate prices are given in Table 2.
Adjustments
8.        Prices for the winter period (January-May) 1973 were substantially
higher for a number of commodities than they were in the same period 1972



ANNEX 13
Page 2
(Table 1). For individual commodities, however, they were lower than in
certain previous years. The winter period in 1972 was exceptional because
of closure of the Syrian border which caused prices to fall. The 1973 winter
period is assumed to have some element of inflation reflected in its prices
(about 6%), but, relatively high prices in 1973 also reflect short supplies.
Average winter prices during recent years were as follows:

9.        It may be seen that excluding or including 1973 prices from the
lot*ger-term average (1968-72 or 1968-73) has little impact on the average
orice level. In some cases inclusion of 1973 raises the average and in
other cases it lowers it. The 1973 prices were, except for two commodities,
well above the longer period average, and in 9 out of 14 cases above prev-
ious peak levels. This suggests a rising trend in prices despite the high
degree of seasonal and annual instability. Since price movements among
cvmnwcdities are not uniform it is not reasonable to select any one series
as an appropriate base. The 1971-73 average winter price has therefore
been selected as base point. Where the 1971-73 average price is equal to
or above the 1968-73 average prices it has not been adjusted. Where it is
below the longer term average, the base price has been raised to equal the
itighest price, not to exceed the 1973 prices for winter crops. For summer
crops, where annual fluctuations are relatively small, the 1970-72 crop price
has been used. Actual prices used are in Table 3.

NORTHEAST GHOR IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Farm Budgets, Project Charges and Farmers' Income
Farm Budgets
1.        Farm budgets have been prepared for the following typical farm
models:
(a) 3 ha vegetable farm,
(b) 3 ha fruit and vegetable farm,
(c) 4 ha citrus farm,
(d) 15 ha citrus farm,
(e) 15 ha fruit and vegetable farm.
These farn models reflect the impact of the project. Both owner-operated
and sharecropped conditions are presented. Without the project, production
costs (Tables 1 and 2) include annual costs, land taxes, water costs (on the
presently irrigated area) and interest on working capital, which has been
assumed at 10% per annum for a period of 12 months for perrenial and six
months for annual crops. These costs vary with farm size. Costs of family
labor are shown separately. With the project, production costs (Tables 1 and
2) consist of annual costs, establishment costs of orchards, land taxes
and interest on working capital and on intermediate loans to acquire on-
farm pipes. The establishment costs of citrus and bananas takes into account
maintenance costs during pre-fruition years. These costs have been annualized
by assuming a 40-year life for citrus and 8 years for bananas. Farmgate
prices are given in Annex 13, Table 3.
Project Charges
2.        Investment costs (including replacement costs) and all operation
and maintenance costs are proposed to be recovered over the project life
of 40 years on a volume basis for both gravity and sprinkler systems which
would be 6 fils O3. On this basis the project charges would amount to a
minimum of 17% and a maximum of 36% of the incremental income of 3 ha and
15 ha farms respectively. 15 ha farms only represent 1% of the project area.
Farmers Income
3.        The farmer's incremental incomes, after payment of project charges
and the per capita income based on a family size of 5.7 persons would be
as follows:

Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1.        The economic rate of return of the project, costing family labor at
750 fils (JD 0.75) per day and hired labor at the market rate of JD 1 per day,
would be 24%. A-breakdown of investment costs, and operation, maintenance
and replacement costs as well as total and net benefits over the project life-
time of 40 years (1974-2013) is presented in Table 1. Net benefits excluding
the social development component (minor works) are given in Table 2. The
bases of annual production costs are given in Tables 1-2 of Annex 14 and
the prices used to evaluate benefits are given in Annex 13, Table 3. The
development pattern of various crops is presented in Annex 14. Major assump-
tions made for calculating the initial economic rate of return include:
(a)  the economic life of on-farm sprinkler pipes, valves and
related equipment would be 15 years while that of other
structures would be 40 years;
(b)  investment costs exclude costs of land acquisition, price
contingencies and credit for annual production inputs, the
latter being included in annual production costs;
(c)  the value of production foregone due to dislocation caused
by land leveling, installation of sprinkler equipment, drain-
age and other project works, most of which will be carried
out in the present off season and much of which will have
a minimal impact on the area, is assumed to equal the 2%
annual increase in net value of productions which would
have taken place during the conlstruction period (1975-78)
without the project; and in land physically lost to project
structures is accounted for by the reduced area available
for cultivation after the project;
(d)  full development would be achieved in 1983.  Production
costs and benefits commence in the year following completion
of works in specific areas, they increase 50% in the first
two years and 50% in the following three years. These de-
velopments are phased separately for the sprinkler and gravity
irrigation areas;
(e) project investment costs, production inputs and project bene-
fits are costed at current prices and maintained for the
project life;



A=N9X 15
Page 2
if) the operation of the assembly markets and packing and grading
stations is assumed as self-sustaining. Their operating and
replacement costs and benefits are excluded from the analysis,
but initial investment and staff costs for the first three
years are included.
2.        The results of sensitivity tests are summarized below:
Assumption                                     Economic Rate of Return
(a)  Initial run                                        24.00%
(b)  Benefits reduced 25%                               17.92Z
(c)  Costs increased 25%                                18.96%
(d)  (b) & (c)                                          14.54Z
(e)  Without social development component
(minor works)                                   29.132
