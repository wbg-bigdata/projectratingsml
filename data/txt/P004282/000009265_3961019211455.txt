IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PLANT REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2772-MA)
Preface
This is an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Energy Efficiency and Plant
Rehabilitation Project in Malaysia for which Loan 2772-MA in the amount of USS100 million
equivalent was approved on July 6, 1987. A total of US$33.7 million was cancelled, and the last
disbursement took place on June 10, 1994.
The ICR was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region, and was reviewed by Mr. J.
Shivakumar, Chief of Infrastructure Operations Division, East Asia and Pacific Region 1.  The
Borrower, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), provided comments on the ICR and prepared a Borrower's
Evaluation Report in accordance with ICR guidelines, which are included as Appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the ICR Completion Mission in July, 1995. It
is based on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and TNB, internal Bank Memoranda and other material in project
files. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by providing most of the financial,
performance and investment data for the project, and supplementing the Bank's information on the
project implementation and operation experience.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PLANT REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2772-MA)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.         The Bank has had a long and constructive relationship spanning over three decades with
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), formerly known as the National Electricity Board (NEB) of the states
of Malaya. With the completion of this project and the conclusion of all of the Bank's programs with
TNB, the IBRD has assisted in financing a total of 12 power development projects with TNB. At the
time of project preparation in 1985, electricity consumption had been growing rapidly in peninsular
Malaysia, and demand was expected to continue to grow at an appreciable rate into the early 1990s with
growth of the economy. Simultaneously, the Government was concerned that rapid rise in domestic
consumption of petroleum, used for power and other needs, may exert greater pressure on export
earnings due to decrease in petroleum prices in the 1980s. Reduction in export earnings from other
commodities was also of concern to the Government.
2.         The objectives of the program executed under this Loan were: (a) to rehabilitate TNB's
existing generation facilities to recoup power capacity and increase fuel efficiencies in power
generation; (b) to upgrade system control to enhance the efficiency of system operations; (c) to
rationalize transmission systems to remove transmission bottle-necks and reduce transmission and
distribution losses; (d) to increase usage of the country's economic and abundant gas resources in place
of fuel oil; and (e) to further institutional and management capabilities (para 2).
3.         At appraisal, these objectives were to be achieved by rehabilitating/modifying several
power units to recover about 116 MW of capacity at three different power plant locations, converting
about 840 MW of oil fired capacity to dual (gas/oil) firing capability, rationalizing and upgrading the
transmission system for the burgeoning Kuala Lumpur area through construction of a 275 kV ring and
nine substations, modernizing the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC), and establishing three
additional Regional Control Centers (RCC's) to perform SCADA functions around the large consuming
areas of Penang, Johor Baru and Klang (para 3). The project also provided for significant technical
assistance to increase organizational and operational efficiency within TNB.
4.         The Loan covenants required TNB, the Borrower, to maintain a self-financing (SFR) ratio
of 30% on its average annual capital investments, a debt service ratio above 1.3, and a debt to debt plus
equity ratio of less than 60% (Part II, Table 10) to ensure that the utility remained financially strong
and capable of meeting its investment programs.
5.         In the early stages of project implementation, the Government of Malaysia entered into a
trade deal with the Government of India, which required that the entire power plant rehabilitation
program under the project be entrusted to Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited of India. This development
led to the cancellation of US$31 million from the Loan, resulted in a much larger scope of work and a



-iii-
loss of control by the Bank over the implementation program. Another significant development that
took place in 1992 was the privatization of TNB which led the Government to cancel TNB's next
project "Power System Development Project" after its approval by the Board. With future lending to
the power sector and completion of disbursements for the project, Bank's relationship with the
Malaysian power sector virtually ended in 1992. The Borrower ceased to provide quarterly progress
reports and the Bank's supervision missions ended in 1993, despite continuation of the project for
another 30 months. At the time of the ICR mission, the project was about 95% complete and despite
best efforts and cooperation on the part of TNB, all data necessary for preparation of the ICR could not
be made available.
6.          Excluding  interest during  construction  (IDC) and  certain  significant unresolved
contingencies and claims, the project is expected to be completed at US$280 million compared to an
appraisal estimate of US$160 million (Part 11, Table 8A).  The Bank initially provided a loan of
US$100 million to cover 79%  of the foreign costs.  Based on arrangements made between the
Governments of Malaysia and India on trade issues, the Borrower procured the rehabilitation and
conversion components on a negotiated basis, which led to cancellation of US$31 million out of a total
US$34 million canceled by the Bank at closing (Part 11, Table 4).
Implementation Experience and Results
7.          The objectives of the project have been substantially achieved. With respect to the total
MW recovery and efficiency goals for the rehabilitation and conversion components, the appraisal
objectives were significantly surpassed. The project is expected to contribute significantly in alleviating
the shortages in generation capacity and in conserving petroleum  resources for export.  The plant
rehabilitation program, together with the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS)
installed, will result in the recovery of significant generation capacity (420 MW) through recovery of
rated capacity (210 MW) and improvement in plant availability (210 MW). The total capacity recovery
obtained has been tentatively estimated at about three and half times that (116 MW) planned for at
appraisal. A fresh audit on the condition of the plants during project implementation, especially with
respect to safety and control aspects, revealed that the plant units were in need of significantly higher
levels of investment than estimated at appraisal. The additional investments were also expected to result
in higher plant capacity recovery and significantly improved fuel efficiency and operability of the units
(Appendix C, pages 2-3). The CMMS has assisted in improving the operations and availability at
several of TNB's thermal and hydro-generating plants. The conversion of several plant units (840 MW)
from oil to dual firing will result in significant increase in the use of abundantly available, economic
and cleaner gas fuel in place of fuel oil (paras 6-7).
8.          Completion of the transmission system rationalization program for Kuala Lumpur and its
environs has resulted in the removal of bottlenecks in the system, reduction in losses, increased
efficiency in the operations, and also increased reliability of the supply system in the high consuming
and growth area. When the NLDC and RCC's are fully operational at the end of 1995, several benefits
discussed above will also accrue for TNB as a whole and the three large regional distribution systems.
Completion of the computerized materials information system will promote increased efficiency in
inventory contrbl, improved access to materials for servicing the operations, and reduction in paper-
work and staffing needs.  The study on inventory of fixed assets has resulted in procedures for
incorporating new assets into operation and appropriate charging of depreciation as assets are moved



-Iv-
into operation. Thus, the financial accounting system now has a capability for calculating the ROR
accurately (para 12).  Together with the CMMS installed, the institutional development measures
included in the project have strengthened TNB institutionally and enhanced benefits resulting from these
are expected in future.  Other institutional strengthening measures were either completed or were
postponed around the time that TNB was reorganized and converted into a public limited company (Part
11, Table 7). The impact of the recommendations on these studies has not been shared with the Bank
for reasons of confidentiality.
9.          Some delays resulted from the slow pace in making procurement decisions; however, other
significant delays for overall project completion were caused by factors beyond the control of TNB
(para 16).  The supplier for GIS switchgear went into bankruptcy proceedings and delayed the
completion of the transmission rationalization component by over a year. Severe shortages of power
capacity toward and past 1990 restricted the outaging of plant units planned for rehabilitation and
conversion, and as a result the rehabilitation and conversion components were delayed by over 30
months. With completion of this project, TNB's IERR for its investment program for the last ten years
was 11.9%, and is close to the appraisal estimate of 12%. The average annual ROR in the FY90-94
interval based on 3-year averaging of the rate base was 11.9%, and is substantially higher than the
appraisal estimate of 8.3% (para 13). TNB returned a strong financial performance during the five year
period, and was in compliance with the financial covenants during the last eight years, except with
respect to the SFR, which dipped below the covenanted level in FY91 and FY94 (Appendix C, page 1).
When evaluated following acquisition of operating and performance data, the rehabilitation, plant
conversion, and transmission system rationalization components could show lower IERRs than those
estimated during appraisal. However, as discussed in Appendix C, the benefits and accomplishments
under these components are still significant.
Findings, Future Operations, and Lessons Learned
10.        The overall outcome for the project is satisfactory, despite a 3-year delay in its
completion. The project's sustainability is highly likely. The Bank's involvement with the Borrower
over the last three decades has assisted in strengthening TNB into a technically competent, financially
strong, and efficient utility. On the whole and with some qualifications, the Borrower performed
satisfactorily during preparation and implementation of this complicated project (Section F, para. 23-
24). The Bank's relationship with the Borrower and other government entities involved with power
was marked with cordiality and cooperation on all sides.
11.        With cessation of new Bank lending and completion of disbursements for the project in
1992, the Bank's relationship with the Malaysian power sector virtually ended in 1992. The Bank's
supervision missions ended in 1993, despite continuation of the project for another 30 months. The
Borrower had earlier ceased to provide implementation progress reports required under Loan covenants.
12.        The main task ahead for the Borrower in future is to consolidate the benefits of the
project. Site acceptance and reliability tests for the new system at the NLDC have to be completed.
The transmission rationalization component has to be planned for augmentation, since demand will
overtake the capacity of the system within three years. Training in operating the CMIS and other
operations/systems commissioned under this project will have to be instituted or continued. The



Borrower is expected to be successful in sustaining and maximizing the benefits expected from this
project.
13.        There are three significant lessons which may be deduced from  the implementation
experience on this project: (i) Rigorous and extensive effort during project preparation are needed in
the case of extensive rehabilitation of old thermal plants; (ii) The Bank's currency pooling system and
one-sided designation of repayment currencies discourage borrowers to seek Bank funds due to added
complexity and risk; and (iii) when new sector lending is discontinued, supervision missions for on-
going projects should continue until project completion.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PLANT REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2772-MA)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Obiectives
1.         The Bank has assisted in financing a total of 12 power generation, transmission expansion,
and rural electrification projects with Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), formerly known as the National
Electricity Board (NEB) of the states of Malaya, since the late 1950's. Electricity sales, of which
TNB's share was 95% in 1985, grew rapidly in Malaysia from 1,210 GWh in 1965 to 11,940 GWh in
1985. Electricity demand was projected to grow in Malaysia at about 7% p.a. from 1985 to the early
nineties. The major part (54%) of TNB's generation capacity in 1986 was oil based, while hydropower
(30%) and gas based generation (16%) comprised the rest. In the mid 1980's, the Malaysian economy
was highly dependent on petroleum exports for foreign exchange earnings, and the resulting export
revenues provided 90% of the financing needs for the federal capital investment program. The
Government was concerned that the decline in oil prices beginning in the early 1980's, together with
reduced export earnings from tin, palm oil and rubber, would increase the country's debt-service load.
The Government was also concerned that rapid increase in domestic consumption of petroleum may
further sharply reduce export earnings and thus lead to a worsening of the foreign exchange situation.
There was thus a good rationale for reducing petroleum consumption in power generation, increasing
power system efficiency, and making additional modest investments to recoup a significant fraction of
the unavailable capacity in existing power plants.
2.         The objectives of the program executed under this Loan were to rehabilitate TNB's
existing generation facilities to recoup power capacity and increase fuel efficiencies in power
generation; upgrade system control to enhance the efficiency of system operations; rationalize
transmission systems to remove transmission bottle-necks and reduce transmission and distribution
losses; increase usage of the country's economic and abundant gas resources in place of fuel oil; and
further institutional and management capabilities (Section A, para 2).
3.         The objectives of the project were to be attained by  design, procurement and/or
construction of the following physical components: (a) rehabilitation of seven power units (4x60 +
3x120 MW) at the Tuanku Jaafar power station (TJPS), three units (3x120 + 3x30 MW) at the Prai
power station (PPS), and two units (2x120 MW) at the Sultan Iskandar power station (SIPS), and
conversion of 600 MW of plants at TJPS and 240 MW at SIPS from oil to oil/gas firing; (b)
introduction of computerized maintenance management systems to six thermal power and three
hydropower stations;  (c) modernization of TNB's national load dispatch center (NLDC), and
installation of three regional distribution control centers at Penang, Johore Baru and Klang to provide
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) functions; and (d) installation of a 275 kV, 72 km
transmission ring and nine substations with 2,190 MVA transformer capacity to rationalize the power



-2-
supply system, reduce system losses and improve reliability of supply to the high growth and
consumption area of Kuala Lumpur and its surroundings.
4.         In addition, the project planned a fair amount of assistance to strengthen TNB's
capabilities in the following areas: (a) technical assistance  for distribution system  planning,
management, operation and maintenance, and loss assessment and reduction; (b) consultant services to
promote organizational efficiency through the conduct of a study; (c) technical services to evolve a
computerized materials handling and inventory control system; (d) a study to update TNB's inventory
of fixed assets and development of an accounting system to compute the rate base based on the fixed
assets; and (e) technical assistance to conduct a human resources development study. At the time of
appraisal, TNB had substantial experience in successfully executing projects similar to those under the
Loan. Hence, the risks involved in successfully implementing the project components under the Loan
were minimal.
B. Achievement of Obiectives
5.         Overall, the project objectives have been substantially achieved, and in some instances, the
appraisal objectives/estimates have been significantly exceeded.  However, detailed or quantitative
discussion of the accomplishments on some components of the project financed under the Loan cannot
yet be fully presented, since the ICR mission took place in July, 1995, when the project was about 95%
complete. Performance evaluation of some of the components requires operation for a period of six
months to a year following completion. Moreover, following the transformation of TNB into a public
limited company, TNB was reorganized, and with total cessation of new Bank lending at TNB's request
in 1992, Bank's association with Malaysia's power sector virtually ceased, and periodic reporting on
progress of the project, as required by the covenants, was discontinued by TNB.  Based on
considerations discussed elsewhere (Section C, para. 19) TNB also decided to procure the plant
rehabilitation and conversion components without resort to international competitive bidding. Thus,
with completion of disbursements for the project, Bank's supervision of the project was prematurely
discontinued in 1993, despite further delays in project completion for a period of two years.
6.         The rehabilitation and modification program involving 12 power units at TJPS, PPS and
SIPS was well-conceived in anticipation of the power shortages and high economic growth rates
experienced since the late eighties in Malaysia (Power consumption increased rapidly, and during the
five year interval FY90-94, grew at an average compounded rate of about 11 % p.a.). Following a re-
evaluation of the condition of the power plant units during implementation, TNB decided to institute
more extensive rehabilitation/modification of the units to recover about 420 MW of capacity, more than
three times the appraisal estimate. Total MW recovery was effected in approximately equal proportions
between recovery of rated capacity and that based on improvements in availability (Appendix C, page
2-3). Significant increases in plant efficiency (between 2 to 4.2%) have either been noted on plants
completing tests or are estimated for plants due to undergo testing. Capacity addition and efficiency
improvement under this program has been achieved with about an investment of US$300 per kW, and
this is appreciably lower than the estimated alternative investment of US$450 per kW, including site
preparation and development costs, for installment of new gas turbine plants.
7.         C6nVersion of 840 MW of capacity at TJPS and SIPS from oil to oil/gas firing is expected
to lower TNB's fuel cost, as gas fuel costs less than fuel oil. The substitution of gas for oil in these
plants also preserves petroleum-based export earnings especially as domestic petroleum consumption has



-3-
been increasing rapidly in Malaysia.  With the pursuit of a low  investment approach for the
intermediate term in tapping needed additional power capacity, the overall project has also assisted in
alleviating the foreign exchange situation.
8.         The introduction of the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to six
thermal power stations and three hydro-power stations resulted in promoting more accountability and
improving efficiency in maintenance operations, and increasing the availability at TNB's thermal and
hydro-power plants. Following the installation of the system, the weighted average availability at
TNB's plants has increased by 4.9%, and is close to the target improvement of 5%.
9.         With the completion of construction of a 60 km long, 275 kV transmission ring to feed
power into the existing 132 kV system through seven new gas insulated switchgear substations, the high
consuming and high growth Kuala Lumpur area has a more reliable and rationalized transmission
system, which has reduced system losses.
10.        Under the Loan, the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) was upgraded with new
computers and associated hardware, including necessary telecontrol system. This modernized system
includes an energy management system to achieve on-line automatic control, unit commitment,
production costing and economic dispatch, spinning reserve monitoring, and contingency analysis. Due
to extensive distribution system expansions, the Penang, Johor Baru and Klang areas were provided
with Regional Control Centers (RCC) to perform SCADA functions for the network in these
jurisdictions and to communicate and interact with the NLDC. When fully operational in early 1996,
these facilities are expected to increase reliability of the system, decrease losses, and lower costs for the
power and transmission system in Malaysia.
11.        Implementation of the project also resulted in a number of institutional strengthening
accomplishments. The materials management system implemented in 1995 is expected to reduce
inventory levels, ensure stocking in the most appropriate locations, and expedite retrieval of materials
necessary for servicing the facilities.  It is also expected to reduce paper-work and manpower
requirements for managing the inventory. As noted in paragraph 8 above, completion of the study on
CMMS and installation of the system has had significant beneficial impact on the operation of TNB's
generation plants.
12.        A comprehensive inventory and valuation of fixed assets and establishment of procedures
for incorporation of assets into operation was also tasked under the Loan. Prior to 1986, TNB's rates
of return on fixed assets were overestimated due to delays in transferring assets into operation.
Completion of the fixed asset accounting tasks in 1990 enabled TNB to claim depreciation expenses
appropriately which helped maintain an adequate rate of return on total assets in operation.  A human
resources development study to assist with the functioning of a Human Resource Development Unit
established within TNB in 1985 was completed under the project; however, the Bank was unable to
determine its impact, as decisions to implement its recommendations were delayed by the management
with the impending transformation of TNB  into a limited public company.   For reasons of
confidentiality, the ICR mission could not obtain information from TNB on what the recommendations
of the study were implemented in 1992.
13.        TNB posted a strong financial performance for the five year interval (FY90-94). The rate
of return (ROR) on revalued fixed assets averaged 11.9% for the period, and compared favorably with
the appraisal estimate of 8.3%, even though the per kWh revenue did not increase appreciably in the



-4-
period. The large kWh sales increases was the predominant reason for the high ROR in relation to the
appraisal estimate. Overall, TNB was in compliance with all financial covenants negotiated with the
Bank except with respect to the self-financing ratio (SFR) in certain years. The SFR averaged 30.4%
during the five year period, which though lower than the five year appraisal average estimate of 44%,
nevertheless, met the covenanted level of 30%. The SFRs of 21% and 13.3% for FY91 and 94,
respectively, were lower than the covenanted minimum of 30%. In FY91 the shortfall was accounted
for largely by lower operating revenues due to higher than anticipated fuel expenses, the high capital
investment needed in the period (M$2.4 billion against the estimated level of M$1.5 billion), higher
than estimated debt service load, and increases in working capital and dividend payments. Also in
FY94, an increase in the capital expenditure of about 77% over that anticipated at appraisal coupled
with higher than expected debt servicing requirements contributed to the lower SFR. Despite non-
compliance with the covenanted SFR of 30% in certain years, TNB paid dividends in FY91 (M$70.4
million) and the amounts escalated from M$36.8 million in FY92 to M$231 million in FY93 and to
M$246.7 million in FY94. However, these dividends were essential to TNBs privatization and the
floatation of its shares which required maintenance of an attractive dividend payout ratio. The debt to
debt plus equity ratio and debt service ratio for the period are well within the Bank covenanted values.
TNBs financial performance is discussed in more detail in Appendix C page 1.
14.        The internal economic rate of return (IERR) computed by TNB for its investment program
using the same methodology as in the SAR is 11.9%, which is close to the appraisal estimate of 12%.
The IERR is higher than TNB's present opportunity cost of capital, which is below 10%. Only a
qualitative evaluation of the economic benefits of the plant rehabilitation and modification program is
possible at this time since six of the twelve power units have not been operated and tested over a
sufficiently long period.  As discussed in Part 11 (Appendix C, pages 2 -3), the IERR for the
rehabilitation and modification program could be lower than the SAR estimate of 19.8%. The plant
conversion program to convert from oil to gas/oil firing could also have lower IERRs than those
estimated during the appraisal as discussed in Part II ( Appendix C, page 2-3).
15.         The IERR for the transmission rationalization cannot be estimated with reasonable
certainty due to a paucity of operating data required for analysis.  The completion cost for the
component was 34% above the appraisal estimate. Despite the implicitly higher consumption rates for
electricity in the Kuala Lumpur area, it is probable that the IERR for this component of the project
would be below the appraisal estimate of 13.9%, when computed in future using actual operating and
consumption data.
C. Implementation Record and Maior Factors Affecting the Proiect
16.        TNB was responsible .or implementing all components of the project, with the assistance
of consultants and contractors wherever needed. As shown in Part 11, Table 3 there was an overall
delay of about three years in completion of the project. Almost every component of the project (Part
11, Table 5) encountered significant delay in completion. Overall, delay in procurement decisions
resulting in delays/postponements in bid preparation/flotation and tender evaluation and awards,
contributed to delays in project completion. Certain unanticipated contingencies also contributed to
delays in impl6mEntation and completion. The transmission system rationalization project for Kuala
Lumpur suffered an 18-month delay because the supplier of 132 kV GIS switchgear went into
bankruptcy proceedings. Land acquisition problems also required modification of the transmission and



-5-
substation construction project with reduction in the number of substations constructed and a shortening
of the lines by about 12 kin, even though overall appraisal objectives were not diluted.  A
comprehensive inspection of the power plant units during implementation revealed that the units were in
need of more investments to prolong life and ensure safe operations than had been assumed during
project preparation. The power shortages experienced in the early 1990s prevented outaging of plants
scheduled for rehabilitation. The schedule for plant rehabilitation and conversion work had to be
stretched out since simultaneous outaging of plants could not be permitted on account of the serious
shortages in electricity supplies. This was a major contributory factor in delays for completion of the
plant rehabilitation and modification component.
17.        Project completion costs shown in Table 8A (Part 11) are tentative, since contingencies and
claims, estimated to be significant in relation to costs shown, will not be resolved until evaluation of
completed work and negotiation. Without including these claims/contingencies and interest during
construction (IDC), the actual completion cost of the project totals US$280 million, compared to the
appraisal estimate of US$160 million. The rehabilitation and plant conversion components were
completed at a total of US$118 million, which is about four times the appraisal estimate.  The
substantial increase in the cost represents the cost of more extensive rehabilitation of the plants to
recover about three and a half times the MW estimated at appraisal and also to substantially increase the
efficiency ratings of the plants. The additional rehabilitation/modification work performed beyond the
appraisal plans has been  briefly  listed  in  Part II (Appendix  C, pages  11-13).   The
rehabilitation/modification costs do not include about M$70 million of claims, which are yet to be
resolved.
18.        The computerized maintenance management system was completed at US$2.9 million,
50% above the appraisal estimate. The NLDC and three RCC's are projected to be completed by the
end of 1995 at US$26.7 million, which is close to the appraisal estimate.  However, there are
significant claims and counter-claims (15% of the project cost) remaining to be negotiated or resolved.
The consultant services for the project was completed at an estimated USS7.6 million, and exceeds the
appraisal estimate of USS5.5 million. The overall transmission system rationalization component for
the Kuala Lumpur area was completed at US$105.6 million, about 34% above the appraisal estimate.
The project completed under the Loan omitted two of the nine switching substations and about 12 of
the 72 km of lines included in the rationalization project during appraisal. The completion cost for the
substations was US$88.6 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$68.7 million (Appendix C,
page 10). The transmission line was completed at a cost of US$17.1 million, and was 70% above the
appraisal estimate of US$10 million.
19.        The Bank initially provided a loan of US$100 million to cover 79% of the appraised
foreign costs for the project. Based on arrangements reached between the governments of Malaysia and
India on reciprocal trade issues during implementation, TNB decided to procure the plant rehabilitation
and conversion components on a negotiated basis, which led the Bank to cancel a loan amount of US
$31 million in March 1988. An additional US$2.7 million was canceled just prior to loan closing.
Information on the sources of other funding for the project is not available.
D. Project Sustainability
20.        The projects completed under the Loan are likely to be sustained, with TNB benefitting
substantially from the gains resulting from the project.  Operating results on power plants which have



-6-
been rehabilitated show that the units have exceeded the performance objectives set during appraisal,
and, in a majority of cases, the significantly enhanced performance standards redefined during
implementation when additional investments were planned (Appendix C, page 11). The transmission
system rationalization component has been operating effectively in providing the Kuala Lumpur area
with higher level of energy demand than anticipated during appraisal. The computerized maintenance
management system is likely to enhance the efficiency of operations to a level higher than what has
been achieved so far.
E. Bank Performance
21.        Overall, the Bank's performance in project identification, preparation, appraisal, and
supervision has been satisfactory.  The Bank has provided significant assistance to TNB and the
Government in formulating TNB's investment programs, while also providing valuable advice on
energy sector issues during the high growth demand years of the 1970s and 1980s. The Bank's
relationship with TNB and other entities concerned with the power sector in Malaysia has been
conducted in a cooperative spirit and has been marked by cordiality on all sides.  The Bank's
participation in the power sector in Malaysia over a period of three decades has assisted TNB to
develop into a technically competent, financially strong, and efficient utility. The Bank's relationship
with the Malaysian power sector ended in 1992, following the Government's initiative towards
privatization of the sector.
22.        TNB expressed dissatisfaction with the Banks Currency Pooling System (CPS), which was
introduced during the implementation of the project (Appendix B, page ix). TNB considered the CPS
an undesirable system because TNB became negatively exposed to the foreign currency risk.  In
addition, TNB could not forecast the size of foreign exchange risk exposure because the portions of
each currency in the currency pool could not be reasonably determnined at the time of  loan
disbursements.
F. Borrower's Performance
23.        On the whole and with some qualifications as noted below, the Borrower's performance in
planning, preparation and implementation of this complicated project was satisfactory. Procurement
decisions could have been made more expeditiously, and this would have expedited major parts of the
project by a year or more. The Borrower could have avoided delays in the procurement of switchgear
equipment, since the bid offer from the supplier which went into bankruptcy proceedings appeared to
be suspiciously low in relation to all others received and did not fully conform to the tender. Finally,
a more rigorous evaluation during project preparation on the condition of the power units proposed for
rehabilitation could have resulted ia better appreciation of costs and implementation schedules. The
average per kW recovery cost, with settlement of claims, is likely to reach US$300/kW, a level close to
about 70% of the cost of new gas turbines.
24.        TNB did not fully conform to Loan covenants with respect to reporting of progress after
1992. TNB also could not provide all the required data/information for preparation of the ICR.



-7-
G. Assessment of Overall Outcome
25.         The overall outcome for the project is rated as satisfactory. The overall project resulted in
strong efficiency gains in the power plants, conservation of relatively scarce petroleum resources
through substitution of gas fuel in power units, near term savings in foreign exchange requirements,
cost reductions in the operation of a number of plants, and reduction in transmission and system losses.
H. Future Ogerations
26.         With completion of the project, TNB's main emphasis would be to maximize the
performance levels of the capabilities installed or procured under this Loan. To maximize benefits for
the materials management system, staff training needs to be completed on the use and benefits of the
system. The site acceptance and reliability tests for the system installed at the NLDC have to be
completed successfully, after which staff training would need to be instituted to maximize benefits from
its operation. The present spare capacity for the Kuala Lumpur area transmission system will approach
full utilization in two to three years, and augmentation of these capabilities are being planned to
maximize the benefits of the component funded under the Loan.
1. Key Lessons Learned
27.         There are some lessons which may be deduced from the implementation experience, all of
which are not new or exclusive to this project.
(1)   Much greater effort is needed during preparation of projects for major power plant
rehabilitation, to examine scope, feasibility, merit and appropriateness of the planned
investments. In retrospect, some of the power units may have been rehabilitated at a
relatively high cost, in relation to their life expectancies (Section F, para. 23).
(2)   The Banks currency pooling system and one-sided designation of repayment currencies
discourage borrowers to borrow the funds due to the added administrative complexity and
uncertainty of the system (Section E, para. 22).
(3)   For projects for which there is no follow-up sector lending, there is a likelihood of Bank-
Borrower relationship weakening during the later stages of project implementation, as
happened on this project. Bank staff need to continue supervision visits until project
completion.

Aide-Memoir
World Bank Mission. June 19-30. 1995
1.   A World Bank mission comprising of Mr. Brahm Prasher (consultant) visited
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) between July 19 and 30, 1995 for a field
completion mission to obtain date and information for preparation of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on the Energy Efficiency and Plant
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2772-MA). The mission wishes to thank TNB
for the cooperation it has received in obtaining data and information required
for preparation of the ICR.
2.   TNB and the mission discussed the Borrower's role in preparing its final
evaluation of the project implementation and operation experience, as
required under the Loan Agreement, including preparation of the summary
report which is to be attached to the ICR. TNB will transmit its evaluation
report for the project, including the summary report, within three months of
the present mission. The Bank will complete the draft ICR on the project
within approximately the same period and will transmit the draft to TNB for
comment. The main findings with respect to the ICR mission are as follows.
3.   The projects financed under Loan 2772-MA have for the most part been
completed satisfactorily, save for a few components which are nearing
completion within the next few months. Of the twelve power plant units,
ten have been successfully rehabilitated and modified, while the remaining
two are scheduled for completion by August and September 1995,
respectively. The mission is pleased to note that all six of the rehabilitated
and modified units recently completing performance testing and evaluation
are capable of operating at availability factors, capacity ratings and fuel
efficiencies, which overall significantly exceed appraisal/design estimates.
4.   The construction of transmission lines and substations for rationalizing
power supply to Kuala Lumpur h0s been fully completed. The transmission
capabilities available for supply of power to Kuala Lumpur has at present a
spare capacity of about 20 percent and this spare capacity is expected to
be fully utilized by growth in power consumption in Kuala Lumpur over the
next few years. The components of the project for upgrading the National
Load Despatch Centre with computers and related equipment, and for
establishment of three computerized Regional Control Centers to perform
SCADA functions for the local networks, has been completed. However,



- 23 -
successful testing of the power system application softwares has not been
completed yet. Site acceptance and reliability tests, both for the National
and three Regional Control Centres, are expected to be completed by
September 1995, after which the control centers are expected to be fully
operational.
5.   The mission is pleased to note that the institutional development and
maintenance management components of the project have significantly
assisted in strengthening TNB's capabilities and operations. It is expected
that there will be further beneficial effects as the management systems are
fully utilized and implemented within TNB.
6.   The mission and TNB discussed operation of the elements of the project
completed under Loan 2772-MA to maximize project benefits in future. To
assess the operations and measure performance, the mission and TNB are
in agreement that project benefits can best be maximized by monitoring
existing performance indicators being extensively used within TNB for the
generation, transmission and other in-house support operations.
7.   TNB has kindly offered to transmit in a few weeks more data and
information for completion of the ICR. This data and information could not
be available during the mission. The mission wishes to thank TNB for its
efforts in assiting the Bank for preparation of the ICR.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PLANT REHABILITATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Introduction
The World Bank loan was initially taken to finance the following projects:
i) Thermal Stations: Plant Rehabilitation and Conversion
ii) Maintenance Management System for Thermal and Hydro Stations
iii)System Control Improvements
iv)Transmission Lines and substations for Power Supply to Kuala Lumpur
v)Institutional Development
a) distribution system planning, management, operation and maintenance,
construction, loss assesment and reduction;
b) organisational efficiency through the conduct of a study to upgrade the
management services department
c) materials management
d) fixed assets accounting through the conduct of a fixed assets inventory
e) human resources development
The projects that are actually being financed from the World Bank are as follows:
a) Maintenance Management Systems for Thermal and Hydro Stations
b) System Control Improvements
c) Consultancy costs for the Plant Rehabilitation and Conversion Project.
d) Transmission Lines and substations for Power supply to Kuala Lumpur
The other projects are either internally financed from TNB's own funds or by other
financiers or the project was not actually carried out.

COMPUTERISED MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project was carried out in order to improve plant availability, efficiency and reduce
maintanance costs. The system was installed at 10 of TNB'S major power stations. The
contract for design, supply,conversion,installation and commissioning of CMMS was
awarded to Messrs. Lahmeyer International of Germany in association with the Electricity
Supply Board of Ireland.
The detail audit report of the existing maintenance management system at the power
stations was carried out and approved on 30 SEPTEMBER 1988. Upon approval of the
report, the contractor proceeded with the development of the detail design. The
installation, conversion and commisioning phase was first tried out at a pilot power
station. On successful completion of this phase, the same was carried out at the other
power stations.
The entire project was completed on 4 May 1990. The total contract price was US
$2.9million, made up of US $1.6 million for the offshore portion and US $1.3 milion for
the local portion.
The long term objective of the CMMS is to increase average power plant availability by
about 5%. The availability trend of seven out of 10 stations are registering positive change
after CMvMS was commisioned. The overall stations weighted average availability has
increased by a significant amount of 4.88% after the implementation of the CIMS. The
thermal stations weighted average availability has increased by a promising 7.68% after
the implementation of CMMS.
Generally the results have been fairly acceptable and encouraging. Other factors such as
increase in maintenance knowledge and efficiency also contributed to this positive results.
Power stations performance can be further improved with usage and increase utilisation of
the CMMS system.
SYSTEM CONTROL INIPROVEMENTS
This project was carried out in order to upgrade the existing NLDC telecontrol system
and establish three new Regional Control Centres (RCC) in Penang, Klang and Johor
Baliru in view of the expansion of the electrical power system and the increase complexity

of the operating system of TNB. The upgraded NLDC telecontrol system also
incorporates an Energy Management System (EMS). The contract for the supply of the
NLDC and RCC Telecontrol Systems was awarded to Westinghouse Systems Limited
U.K.
Scope of work
The scope of work for the whole project covers the following areas:-
a) Replacing the existing NLDC SCADA computer system with a new system which
incorporates an Energy Management System (EMS). The number of RTU's for the NLDC
is increased from the present 34 to 54.
b) Establishing a new computer -based Regional Control Centres at Penang (24 RTU,s),
Klang (27 RTU's) and Johor Bahru (29 RTU's).
c) Development and installation of EMS power system application softwares at NLDC.
Status of Work in Progress
The contract was awarded to Westinghouse Systems Limited in July 1989. The project
was to be completed and handed over to TNB after 32 months in March 1992.
The site acceptance test for the hardwares and SCADA functions have conducted as
follows: -

The main contributing factor to the project delay was the failure of the Factory
Acceptance Tests (FAT) held in February/March 1992. For the purpose of FAT, tests
were conducted to evaluate the performance of the computer systems in handling the
power system expansion up to the year 2005. The performance of the hosts computers for
NLDC and RCC did not meet the contractual requirements and also unacceptable for
real-time operational control of TNB transmission and distribution systems. In order to
comply with the specifications, Westinghouse Systems Limited has to redesign and
upgrade the computer systems. The second Factory Accceptance Test was conducted in
October/November 1992 and the system was accepted for shipment to sites.
Owing to the delay in the project completion, TNB is claiming compensation from the
liquidated damages, as well as to claims arising from opportunity loss due to delay in
implementation of Automatic Generation Control (AGC) which would have contributed to
possible saving of one to two percent in fuel cost. At the same time Westinghouse
Systems Ltd. has also filed some claims against TNB. As such commercial reconciliations
negotiations are in progress between TNB and the contractor. However, the project
progress till completion is not hindered by the commercial counter-claims. The expected
handing over date is September 1 1995.
POWER PLANT REHABILITATION AND CONVERSION PROJECT
Two remaining units under the power plant rehabilitation and conversion project, i.e, Prai
Power Station unit 5 and Sultan Iskandar Power Station Unit 2, are still undergoing
rehabilitation and conversion process, and are expected to be completed in July/August
1995. With the completion of these two units, all 12 units under the PRCP would have
undergone rehabilitation and conversion as set out in the contract between the main
contractor Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BBEL) of India, the sub-contractor Siemens
AG of Germany and Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB).
The project which was planned for completion end of 1992 has been extended
considerably, mainly due to severe power shortage in Malaysia during the implementation
stage. This power shortage forced TNB to reschedule the outage schedule for the units to
undergo rehabilitation and conversion, in order to allow these units to remain in operation
to help the power shortage problem.
Delays during the implementation of the PRCP have been experienced, but this has
affected the overall schedule to a lesser extent than the power shortage problem.
The expected completion date is end of 1995.

Looking from an overall point of view, the targets set for the project have been achieved.
Tuanku Jaafar Power Station (TJPS) 120MW units and Sultan Iskandar Power (SIPS)
120MW units have been converted to gas and are capable of running at rated load 120
MW. For the 120 MW units at TJPS the upgrading of FD and ID Fans under gas
conversion has also increased the capacity to rated load on oil firing.
The increase in capacity at Prai Power Stations (PPS) and SIPS has as well been achieved
by replacing all HP-Heaters.
Increased efficiency has been achieved for the 120MW units, by replacement of HP-heater
at PPS and SIPS, improve air heater seals at TJPS and SIPS and installation of on load
condenser cleaning system for all 120MW units.
Increased availability has been achieved for all rehabilitated units by the mechanical
improvements mentioned above and the installation of new control and instrumentation
system for all the units under the PRCP.
It is concluded that the overall benefit of the PRCP for TNB is significant. New problems
have been revealed during the period from the audit in 1988, carried out by TNB and
Danish Power consult, on which the PRCP scope of work was based on. These problems
are being attended to by TNB in order not to erode the benefits already achieved under
the PRCP.
From the system forecast it has been established that the units under the PRCP will still
play a role even after the year 2000, especially the 120 MW units. This may not have been
the case if the units had not undergone the rehabilitation and conversion. Further the
benefit of the 120 MW units at TJPS and SIPS , being dual fired, has already shown to be
of great advantage during gas curtailment incidences.
TRANSMISSION LINES AND SUBSTATIONS FOR POWER SUPPLY TO
KUALA LUMPUR
In the initial proposal, 7 substations were to be built under the 12th Power Loan, i.e:-
1) Serdang
2) LLN Headquarters
3) Bandar Tun Razak
4) Titiwangsa (Jalan Pahang)
5) Jalan Galloway
6) Pudu Ulu
7) Segambut
v



- 30 -
8) Kg.Lanjut
9) D.C.A. Subang
The actual scope of work did not vary much from the original estimate, except for the
Bandar Tun Razak and Titiwangsa substation which was not financed from the World
Bank Loan. All the nine substations were installed and commisioned by June 8 1995.
For the transmission lines regarding the Transmission System Rationalization, the original
estimate was for the following:-
1) Segambut - K.L. North
2) Segambut - Kg. Lanjut
3) Segamnbut - Damansara Ht.-LLN Headquarters
4) Serdang - Bandar.Tun Razak
5) K.L. (East) - Pudu Ulu - Bandar Tun Razak
6) Connought Bridge - Bkt. Raja
The actual transmission lines that were financed under the 12th Power Loan were as
follows:-
1. K.L. (East) - Kg.Lanjut - Pudu Ulu
2.Pudu Ulu - Bandar Tun Razk - Serdang
3.Segambut - Damansara Height - TNB HQ
The above transmission lines have been completed on November 1994, and with the
commisioning of the substations, the project have benefited the residence and industrial
consumers in the Klang Valley.
FIXED ASSET ACCOUNTING
In 1988, TNB (NEB ) undertook a study on the inventory and revaluation of its fixed
assets in its records as at 31st August 1988.
To undertake the above, TNB appointed and awarded a contract to Messrs. Ewbank
Preece, Brighton, United Kingdom (as the lead) with Messrs. Tenaga Ewbank (a local
cousultancy firm) to carry out the plant and machinery valuation, Messrs. Ernst &
vi



- 31 -
Whinney ( a local accounting firm) to implement and convert the fixed asset records using
the Software International's - Masterpiece Fixed Assets System (MFAS- Computer
System), while the valuation of land and building assets was carried out by Messrs.
C.H.Williamns Talhar & Wong (an international property valuation finn based locally).
The cost of the prroject in carrying out the above study, valuation and converting into
computerised records amounted to about RM2.5 million. The whole project was
completed in 1990 over a duration of about 2 years.
As a result, the project achieved the following major objectives:-
i) Identified and updated the fixed asset records in operation under generation,
transmission, distribution and general assets.
ii) Identified the obselete fixed assets, primarily the generating assets eg.
decommissioned power stations and other generating assets not required for
generation.
iii) A detailed inventory on the land and building assets, matched with physical
checking and valuation carried out with verification of records at the respective
local government land registry.
iv) Revised procedures for timely closing and transferring of capitalised work-in-
progress expenditure to fixed assets, and recommended procedural manuals for
the above items, including procedures for tax treatment and implications.
Subsequently, two further revaluation exercises were carried out only on land and building
assets; one in 1992 for the company's share floatation purpose (values not booked into
company's books) while the other was in 1994 .
MATERIALS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
The Materials Management Information System (M S) was implemented with the
following objectives:-
a)    Upgrade the existing materials management function
b)    Provide real-time facilities
c)    Optimize capital investment in stocks
d)    Minimize inventory expenditures
e)    Provide effective business tool
vii

Implementation
The overall completion of MMIVS project to date is 85%. MMIS is an on-line real-time
system which requires the installation of the telecom leased line to various TNB locations.
A total of 186 locations need to be connected. To date 172 locations have been
connected. The difficulty faced in installing the telecommunication network has shifted the
target completion of the project. The tender was awarded in August 1992 and the original
implementation was 18 months, i.e. completion in February 1994. However, due to the
difficulty in network installation the project completion was delayed and the new target
completion date is by September 1995.
Training
User training is an on-going exercise which was started from January 1994. The status of
training to-date is as follows:
1,500 operational users have been trained which includes storekeepers, clerical staff and
officers directly involved in operational work.
1,300 users will be trained before June 1996. This training will be on operational as well as
on enquiry facilities.
Benefits
The benefits derived so far from the implementation is as follows:-
I.    Real-time information on stockholding and inventory movement company wide.
2.    On-line validation of project account for materials used.
3.    On-line information on purchase orders and receipt
4.    Real-time voucher creation and check printing for Accounts Payable.
5.    Company wide accessability to system and information.

TNB'S PERFOR-MANCE
The original financing amount was for US $1 00m. The actual financing taken was
US $66.34m, US $33.66m being cancelled. For the Plant Rehabilitation and Conversion
Project, since it was a negotiated project, and sufficient suppliers credit was available from
the contractors, i.e, Bharat Heavy Electricals and Kreditstanstalt Fur Weiderafbau, the
project was not funded from the World Bank. Only the consultancy cost being carried out
by the Danish Power Consult was being charged to the World Bank loan 2772. Those
projects which are not funded from the World Bank Loan are either funded internally or
by other financiers.
THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE
In general, the Bank has responded satisfactorily to the requirements of the project.
Withdrawal applications were processed promptly, and requests for extensions of loan
closing were attended to immediately. However, TNB have the following cornments:-
I)    Since the payment of the loan principal are being called in various currencies, it is
difficult for TNB to do a proper hedging as there are no definite cash flow.
2)    The cost of revaluation for the fluctuations in the currencies in the pool should not
be passed to the borrower. If this is to be charged, it should be costed into the
initial interest rate of the borrowing.
SUMMARY
Although the World Bank Loan was principally taken to finance the Plant Rehabilitation
and several other projects, finally only 4 projects are being financed under this loan. Due
to a negotiated tender for the project and availability of sufficient suppliers credit, the
Plant Rehabilitation and Conversion Project was not financed. There were delays in the
implementation of the projects, and especially for the Plant Rehabilitation & Conversion
Project, System Control Improvements and Materials Management Information System
project which are still not completed. Two projects which are financed under this loan,
Maintenance Management System for Thermal and Hydro Stations and the Transmission
Lines and Substations for Power Supply to Kuala Lumpur, have been satisfactorily
completed.

A. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
1.         As shown in the summary on performance (Appendix C, page 4), TNB's financial
performance during the FY9O-94 period has been strong and satisfactory, and, overall, compares
favorably with the appraisal predictions. During this five year period, kWh sales grew at an average
annual rate of about 10.7%, and the total kWh sales in FY94 were about 44% higher than the appraisal
estimate. Electricity sales revenue grew during this period by about 72% to M$5.41 billion in FY94,
while the per kWh revenue only grew by a total 4% in FY90-94 to M$0. 186 per kWh. Net operating
income increased by 49% during this five year period from M$902 to M$1766 million. The FY94 net
operating income was 73 % higher than the appraisal estimate, and this increase approximately
corresponds to the percentage increase in kWh sales during the period.
2.         The rate of return (ROR) based on 3 year averaging of the rate base was 11.9% during
FY90-94, and compares favorably with the appraisal average of 8.3%. The annual ROR oscillated
between 9.6% and 13.8% in this period. The average annual ROR based on historical assets was
13.8%, and exceeded the appraisal average of 11.2% for the five year period. The average debt
service ratio during the five year interval was 1.6. This average was lower than the appraisal estimate
of 1.9, but appreciably higher than the annual 1.3 ratio required by the covenants. During this five
year period, total cash available for debt service was significantly higher than appraisal estimates;
however, provisions for working capital and dividends increased more steeply than estimated during
appraisal. TNB was also in compliance with the covenanted debt service minimum of 1.3 for each fiscal
year.
3.         TNB posted a strong financial performance for the five year interval (FY90-94). The rate
of return (ROR) on revalued fixed assets averaged 11.9% for the period, and compared favorably with
the appraisal estimate of 8.3%, even though the per kWh revenue did not increase appreciably in the
period. The large kWh sales increases was the predominant reason for the high ROR in relation to the
appraisal estimate. Overall, TNB was in compliance with all financial covenants negotiated with the
Bank except with respect to the self-financing ratio (SFR) in certain years. The SFR averaged 30.4%
during the five year period, which though significantly lower than the five year appraisal average
estimate of 44% met the covenanted level of 30%.  The SFRs of 21% and 13.3% for FY91 and 94,
respectively, were lower than the covenanted minimum ratio of 30%. In FY91 the shortfall was
accounted for largely by lower operating revenues due to higher than anticipated fuel expenses, the high
capital investment needed in the period (M$2.4 billion against the estimated level of M$1.5 billion),
higher than estimated debt service load, and increases in working capital and dividend payments. Also
in FY94, an increase in the capital expenditure of about 77% over that anticipated at appraisal coupled
with higher than expected debt servicing requirements contributed to the lower SFR. Despite non-
compliance with the covenanted SFR of 30% in certain years, TNB paid dividends in FY91 (M$70.4
million) and the amounts escalated from M$36.8 million in FY92 to M$231million in FY93 and to
M$246.7 million in FY94. However, these dividends were essential to TNBs privatization and the
floatation of its shares which required maintenance of an attractive dividend payout ratio. The debt to
debt plus equity ratio and debt service ratio for the period are well within the Bank covenanted values.

B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Internal Economic Rate of Return for TNB's Investment Program
4.          An internal economic rate of return (IERR) has been computed for the investment program
(1984-94) by the Borrower, as shown in Part II, Table 9, to reconfirm the viability of the Borrower's
investment program. The methodology used to re-evaluate the rate of return is similar to that used in
the SAR. Fuel costs are based on actual prices paid by TNB up to 1995. Capital costs are the
investment costs of power plant, transmission and distribution system expansions. Economic costs of
natural gas are costs which have been specified by Petronas, the government company responsible for
gas operations and sales. The computations on IERR (Part II, Table 9) show increasing sales revenue
and total costs during the six year period between FY95 and 2000. However, the Borrower has not
provided an explanation on the assumptions or basis used for arriving at the revenue and cost streams
during this period. The re-evaluated economic rate of return is 11.9%, and is close to the 12%
estimate obtained during appraisal. This rate is significantly higher than TNB's present opportunity cost
of capital, which is less than 10%.
Analysis of Investments in Rehabilitated Plant and Computerized Maintenance Management System
(CMMS)
5.         As discussed in Part I, the rehabilitation work on two of the twelve power plants has not
been completed at the time of the ICR mission ending in the beginning of July 1995. Performance test
results, obtained by operating plants over several months, will not be fully available for about half of
the modified plants until mid-1996.  Investment cost "contingencies" and claims, indicated to be
significant in relation to the project costs, have to be resolved before accurate investment data can be
obtained. A qualitative analysis can be deduced based on performance results available on a majority of
the plants and estimated completion costs.
6.          Based on a re-evaluation of the condition of the power plants in 1988 during
implementation, TNB decided to institute more extensive rehabilitation work on the plants and derive
much higher benefits from the resulting investments. The audit on the condition of the plant units also
revealed that safe and disruption-free operation of the units, in the looming context of worsening power
supply situation, would require appreciable investments in instrumentation and control systems for these
plant units. The cost of rehabilitating the 12 plant units, including the cost of the CMMS, increased
significantly from SAR estimate of US$18.1 million to an expected total of US$92.1 million (Table 8a).
However, there is a corresponding increase in total MW recovered. The SAR estimated a total rating
recovery of 50 MW for TIPS, PPb and SIPS, while actual rating recovery estimated at these three
stations is estimated to total about 205 MW. Operating data available from some completed plants have
largely validated these recovery estimates. The SAR assumed availability improvements averaging only
5 % following rehabilitation and modification. Experience on some plants completing rehabilitation and
12-month operation testing suggest availability increases a few times those assumed at appraisal
(Appendix C, page 11). Total MW recovery based on improvements in availability are re-estimated at
210 MW, comrated to SAR estimates of 66 MW. The totaL MW recovery based on both capacity rating
improvements and increased availability is expected to total 420 MW. The corresponding appraisal



-37-
estimate was 116 MW. The recovery cost, inclusive of the cost of CMMS investments, is estimated at
US$300 per kW, and is higher than the estimate of US$156 per kW at appraisal.
7.         The fuel efficiency improvements at appraisal were estimated at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% for the
rehabilitated plants at SIPS, PPS and TJPS, respectively. However, re-estimates or actual test data on
completed plants suggest improvements ranging between 2% and 4.2% for most of the plants. The
IERR for the investment is expected to be below the appraisal estimate of 19.8%, since investment costs
per kW are higher than the appraisal estimates. Fuel cost savings resulting from increased efficiency
could, however, to result in significant off-setting of increased investment costs.
Conversion from Oil to Oil/Gas Firing
8.         Completion costs to convert power plants from oil to dual (oil or gas) firing are expected
to be close to US$28.5 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$13.5 million. The fuel cost
savings estimates were based on the cost of fuel oil at M$7.3/MMBTU (US$120/ton or crude at
US$20/barrel) and gas at M$3.5/MMBTU on the west coast. The differential works out to be about
$3.8/MMBTU. Recently, fuel oil has been priced at about M$7.00/MMBTU (or equivalent to crude at
US$19/barrels), while TNB's cost of gas is M$6/MMBTU on the west coast. Under current fuel prices
paid by TNB, which are likely to prevail in the intermediate term, the fuel cost savings appear to be
about 25 to 35 % of that estimated at appraisal. The pay-back period for the investment is likely to be
between 4 to 6 years. The pay-back period based on the economic cost of gas during appraisal was
estimated to be less than one year. Financially, the plant conversion investment is expected to provide
much reduced benefits; however, with respect to the economic benefits, (based on economic cost of gas
which would be substantially lower than the financial price of M$6/MMBTU) the pay-offs are still
significant.
Transmission Lines and Substations for Supply to Kuala Lumpur
9.         The transmission system rationalization component for supply to the Kuala Lumpur area
was completed at US$106 million (Part 11, Table 8A), about 34% above the appraisal estimate.
However, the component was completed with omission of 12 km of lines out of the appraised estimate
of 72 km, reduction of 390 MVA of transformer capacity out of a total of 2,190 MVA, and omission of
two substations out of nine, including corresponding switch gear equipment. On account of expected
full utilization of capacity for the system in about two years, further augmentation and investment in the
system would be needed, sooner, as compared to the appraisal plans. The actual completion cost of the
system based on equal capacity is implicitly about 20% higher than indicated above. An analysis of the
economic rate of return at this time is not possible on account of the unavailability of operation and
other data. The full system was commissioned at the end of 1994. It is probable that when computed
in future, the economic rate of return for this component would be lower than the appraisal estimate of
13.9%, despite the higher sales for the area.

Thank you for your final draft of the abovc dazed Dccenlbcr 21, 1995.
Wc agree to the rtport cxccpt for the last seniteticc paragraph number 22 on pagc 6. The sentcncc
slhould bc deleted, as our carlicr coninicit was that the opcration of the currcncy pooling system
was such that it is diflicult for TNB to do proper hedging as thcrc is no definite cash flows.
Thank you.
