I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR 1/
1.01      The emergence of oil production in 1973 and successive increase
in petroleum prices have imparted unprecedented dynamism to the Ecuadorian
economy. Domestic demand and GDP rose rapidly; GDP growth of 5.3% per annum
in 1964-1971 increased to a 1972-1978 average of 10.5%. Later, however,
as petroleum exports stabilized and agriculture lagged, GDP growth fell
to only 4.8% p.a. in 1979-1980. By 1980 Ecuador had achieved a GDP per capita
of almost US$1,000 although the small domestic market and limited export
capabilities restricted demand for many products.
1.02      Despite the recent peaking of the petroleum-induced boom, growth
perspectives over the medium and long run remain good because of a strong
resource base in agriculture, fishing and forestry, abundant labor, and a high
investment ratio. But these perspectives can become a reality only if
constraints on the use of resources are removed and incentives encourage
their efficient use. The government has moved toward this end by raising
domestic prices of hydrocarbons--although still to only about one-half of
international levels--which could permit more active exploration by CEPE and
improve public sector revenues. Additional measures are needed to continue
freeing agricultural output from price control. Apparent deficiencies in the
industrial protection/incentive system, favoring capital and import intensive
industries and hampering export competitiveness, have influenced the authori-
ties to plan for a study in depth of the system and possible adjustments, to
be carried out with financial and technical assistance from the Bank as
discussed in paras 1.17 and 3.21.
A.   The Manufacturing Sector
1.03      In line with overall economic expansion, manufacturing 2/ real growth
averaged 10.6% p.a. in 1972-1978 and in 1979-1980 slowed somewhat to 7.8% p.a.
By 1980 manufacturing's share of GDP in current prices was about 16%, having
first fallen with the rapid expansion of the petroleum share in the mid-1970s,
slowly recovered through 1978 and then fallen again (Table 1.1). This share
is smaller than for other middle income countries or for neighboring Latin
American countries, in part because of the extraordinary share of petroleum in
GDP. The ability of manufacturing to have kept even roughly abreast of the
petroleum-fired growth of the 1970s is remarkable, however, reflecting a
stable political and institutional framework, expansive macroeconomic policies
and generous incentives.
1/   This section is based in large part on the Ecuador Economic Development
Issues. Report No. 3723-EC, December 14, 1981.
2/   "Manufacturing" in this report will consistently exclude petroleum refining.

1.04      Although the most recent figures are not available, it is estimated
that most subsectors shared rather equally in this growth, so that little
structural change is evident at the broad subsectoral level. Manufacturing is
still dominated by consumer goods, which accounted for about 60% of output,
employment and investment (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). The share of intermediate
goods industries declined in spite of a small but significant gain in the
metal products and equipment sectors, mainly due to electrical appliance and
vehicle assembly. The structural stability was due probably to the generalized
protection from imports and tax incentives, not discriminating among subsectors
which allowed manufacturers freely to respond to rising domestic demand; there
is so far little prima facie evidence of large scale expansion of highly
inefficient activities. The preponderance of Ecuador's manufacturing remains
in domestic materials transformation--cocoa, coffee and fish processing, sugar
refining, textiles, cement and wood products.

1.05      In the two decades ending in 1970 Ecuador's manufacturing sector
underwent a rapid change from being basically workshop-based 1/ to being
organized in formal factories; output and employment in workshop firms were
essentially static. Since 1970 the formal sector firms have continued rapid
growth, but the output of workshops has resumed growing, albeit more slowly
than other firms. By 1978 the share of output from workshops was only 20% but
these provided 70% of the 321,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector. Of the
formal sector firms, those in the smallest category having from seven to twenty
workers, have grown fastest in output, employment, and productivity.
1.06      Compared with 100,000 or so workshops, the formal industrial sector
comprises only some 1,700 production units, employing an average of 50 persons
each. Only 11 factories in 1977 had more than 500 employees--five of them in
food processing, three in metal products and machinery, two in textiles and
one in cement. Two hundred firms had more than 100 employees, and accounted
for 60 percent of the gross value of output, 67 percent of value added and
74 percent of new investment in the formal sector in 1977. Because of import
protection, the local market for many manufactured products is controlled by
two or three large enterprises. A 1970 survey indicated that in most industries,
1/   Defined for statistical purposes as firms having fewer than seven
employees.



-4-
except for textiles, up to three firms controlled 50-95 percent of the domestic
market. 1/  This situation had not substantially changed by 1980.  Large
industrial groups' also have direct links-common directors and major share- .
holdings--with banks and financial institutions, large agricultural enterprises,
:t wholesale and retail. trade and the media.
1.07      The location of formal manufacturing industry is concentrated in
the provinces around Guayaquil (Guayas) and Quito (Pichincha), which in 1977
contributed respectively 40 and 39 percent of total employment and 46 and 35
percent of value added. Guayas accountedJfor the major share of food, paper
and chemical industries while Pichincha provided the bulk of employment and
value added in textiles, wood products, metal products, machinery and equipment.
These proportions had not changed greatly since 1967 and indicate that govern-
ment incentives to decentralization have so far had quite limited effect.
1.08      Notwithstanding its relatively rapid growth the manufacturing
sector was unable to expand employment opportunities in pace with the growth
of the labor force during 1970-1978; over these years the manufacturing share
in total employment remained-around 12.6%. The renewed growth of workshop
production may increase somewhat the employment share.
1.09      After rising by an average of 1.5% p.a. in real terms in 1970-1978,
minimum compensation 2/ jumped 30% in 1979 and 77% in 1980 because of legislated
increases in the minimum wage. 3/ This sharp increase in labor costs was
heightened by a legislative reduction of 9% in the work week, to forty hours.
These labor costs--now among the highest in Latin America relative to Ecuador's
level of industrialization and per capita income (Table 1.3)--militate against
employment creation, tend further to increase the already high cost per job in
the manufacturing sector and aggravate the bias stemming from capital subsidiz-
ing elements in Ecuador's industrial policy (para 1.10).

B.   Industrial Policy
1.10      Fiscal incentives under the Industrial Promotion Law consist
of exemptions from duties on imported machinery, spare parts and other inputs
not produced in Ecuador, and from numerous minor taxes. Firms may also deduct
from taxable income amounts invested in qualifying new projects. The Law is
administered by an Interministerial Committee for which the Ministry of
Industry, Commerce and Integration provides staff. Firms receiving benefits
under the Law are expected to use domestic inputs to the maximum extent
possible and can in turn expect quantitative limits on competing imports to
guarantee their market. Although a low price for the goods to be produced
is one of the criteria for granting of benefits, this cannot easily be moni-
tored after the project is in operation. The exemption from duties accorded
to imported capital goods accentuates the employment disincentive duc to
minimum wage legislation. Among industries benefiting from the Law the invest-
ment cost per job was US$47,310 in 1979 before the latest jump in wages.
Although the figures in Table 1.4 derive from initial estimates and are not
subsequently confirmed, they are in line with those from the annual manufactur-
ing surveys, rising from US$22,310 in 1967 to US$46,020 in 1977 which however,
represent an increase in real terms over the decade.

1.11      Export incentives in the form of negotiable tax credit certificates
(CAT) used to be granted on the basis of the increase over the previous year's
exports. The subsidy rate, moreover, was related to the absolute value of
exports, thus discriminating against small or first-time exporters. In July
1979, these defects were corrected partially. The incentive is now given on
the total amount exported, at a rate that rises with the proportion of value
added so as to give a 15%-20% subsidy to value added in exporting. Exporters
have duty-free access to imported inputs but the administration of this
benefit is cumbersome. Export incentives could be further improved by exclud-
ing from benefits products, such as processed cocoa, whose effective protection
is high because domestic raw materials are subject to an export tax and those
which enter duty-free into other countries of the Andean Group. Exporters
also receive credit at highly consessional rates (4-8% in Sucres); the credit
subsidy, amounting roughly to an additional 6% of export value, should be
re-examined.
1.12      In spite of incentives, manufactured export performance has been
disappointing on the whole. Excepting refined petroleum products and processed
coffee and cocoa, manufactured exports increased only 15% p.a. in nominal
terms, only about 4% p.a. in real terms, during 1974-80. Preliminary data
show a further slowdown in 1981. Items such as fish products, wood products,
and various food items, all transformations of Ecuador's agricultural and
fishing resources, have increased by almost 40% p.a., however, and now make up
15% of manufactured exports. If export and other incentives are adjusted to
allow Ecuador's comparative advantage to be realized, exports of these and
similar products should continue to do well. Export projects tend to be more
labor intensive than other manufacturing investments as exemplified by projects
financed under the Fourth Loan (Table 1.4). Greater success in exporting manu-
factures would, thus, contribute to employment creation.
1.13      Protection to encourage import substitution industries is based on
several criteria including the protected manufacturer's capacity to supply the
local market, production costs, and profit margins, as perceived at the outset
of the project. Protection mainly takes the form of high import tariffs--up
to 170 percent on consumer goods and zero to 30 percent on raw materials,



-7-
machinery and eql.-rment.  "Inessential" and luxury goods are subject to a 30
percent ad valorem surcharge.  "Inessential" and "semi-essential" goods
imports are also subject to prior import deposit requirements of 10 or 30
percent, respectively, of CIF value; passenger vehicles and certain other
products require prior deposits of 50 percent; incentive legislation exempts
certain sfnns from prior import deposits.  In addition most imports are
subject to a 1 percent tax on CIF value. Some 250 items, mainly "essential
imports", require prior ministerial authorization before import licenses are
granted. Absolute protection in the form of import prohibition is given to
some products. Although licenses are required for all imports, quantitative
restrictions actually apply to few imports.
1.14      The combination of duties, surcharges and taxes purports to give
some local products effective protection of 200 percent and more. However,
local prices for many consumer goods are less out of line with international
(specifically US) prices than the apparent levels of protection would suggest.
In November 1980, retail prices for several categories--footwear, clothing,
plastic housewares, certain cosmetics and pharmaceuticals--were comparable (at
the official exchange rate) to those for similar items in the US 1/. The
largest differentials were for consumer durables such as motorbicycles and
refrigerators (60-70 percent above the US price for similar models) and
motorcars. A number of factors have helped to prevent local manufacturing or
assembly plants from overexploiting their protected position, notably competi-
tion from traditional local wage goods industries and illegal imports.
1.15      Exchange rate stability has favored investment in the manufacturing
sector. But as the real exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar has fallen
(appreciated) by 24% since 1971, imports have become gradually cheaper in rela-
tion to actual or potential local alternatives. This has hampered particularly
the production of those capital goods and intermediate inputs imported duty free
under the Industrial Incentive Law. Likewise, the fall in the real exchange
rate has made export manufacturing less profitable and reinforced the tendency
to concentrate on the protected domestic market. Industrial policy reforms
should encompass an appropriate combination of adjustments in the real exchange
rate, in the level and structure of import protection, and in export subsidies.
1.16      As a founding member of the Andean Group, Ecuador expected sizable
advantages from its association, few of which have been realized. Ecuador's
former trade surplus with the Group has shifted to a small deficit; its Andean
exports fell after 1976 and now make up only 5% of total exports. Under
industrial programming for the Group, Ecuador was assigned production of
items such as petrochemicals and vehicles that are highly capital intensive,
and for which an efficient scale of output may be too large even for the
five countries combined. Because of doubtful commercial prospects, such
projects have to be government sponsored. Recently, however, some other
Andean countries have come to favor deemphasizing programmed allocation among
members of subsectors or product lines, and relying more on intra-Group
competition behind a lower common external tariff. Ecuador could benefit from
this latter approach.

-8-
1.17      Reform of Industrial Incentives.  Various criticisms of the current
industrial incentive system have been raised within Ecuador. It is alleged
that:
(a)  the sacrifice of public revenues may have been more than was
necessary to achieve given results; 1/
(b)  the incentives have probably biased the choice of activities to
which new investment has been directed, giving excessive stimulation
to final consumer products relative to producer goods and exports;
and
(c) relatively capital-intensive and import-intensive products and
techniques of production have been favored, to the detriment
of employment creation.
These concerns are shared by the government and the Bank. The government
has proposed draft revisions in the Industrial Promotion Law which would
effect marginal improvements but recognizes that further changes in the Law
and other incentives may be desirable. Consequently, under the proposed Loan,
the Bank would provide financial and technical assistance for a study of
industrial protection and incentives to be undertaken by the government with
the help of local and foreign consultants (see para. 3.21 and Annex IV).
Identification of changes in incentivies to reduce or even to eliminate the
biases against job creation would be an important goal of the study.
1.18      Because incentives and other factors can give a false impression of
the economic benefits of investment projects, financieras in Ecuador using
Bank funds have long been, and would continue, calculating economic rates of
return (ERR) on larger subprojects. 2/ Estimating border prices for the
subproject's output (usually the single most critical parameter in an ERR
analysis) is difficult where the output is subject to prohibitive tariffs or
quantitative import restrictions as is common in Ecuador. Moreover, while
ERR calculations may exclude "absolutely" inefficient subprojects, they
cannot ensure choice of an optimal combination of factors of production.
Hence, pending more fundamental reforms to reduce distortions, financieras
will be required in their appraisals of larger subprojects: (a) to supply
specific information on their method of estimating the border price in cases
where imports are effectively banned; and (b) to take specific account of
employment creation effects and of whether and to what extent more labor-
intensive technologies were considered kpara. 3.06). Nevertheless the ability
of a financiera to influence these choices is limited so long as prices remain
distorted.
1/   The cost of fiscal incentives to industry has risen rapidly in recent
years. According to one estimate, it was equivalent to 25% of 1979
non-petroleum budget revenue. Investment tax credits accounted for one
half of uncollected revenues, import duty exemptions and export subsidies
to manufactured products for a further 25% and 12%, respectively.
2/   Ecuadorian financieras were the first in the Bank to begin calculating
ERRs.



-9-
1.19      The technical assistance to be provided under the Loan (para 3.20)
would be designed inter alia to help the financieras, particularly the new
ones, improve their subproject analysis to identify the effects of distorted
relative prices. The inclusion in a significant way of 11 new financieras
should help to distribute Bank funds among a larger number of firms and to
finance projects that are smaller than those financed by CFN and COFIEC. More
financing of smaller firms and subprojects should help to reduce the average
cost per job in subprojects financed by the Fifth Development Banking Loan.
C. Outlook
1.20      The manufacturing sector has considerable potential to contribute
to growth of output and employment in coming years if new investment is
channelled into activities that make good use of Ecuador's human and raw
material resources. The government's strategy calls for industry to become
the leading sector as oil exports decline. Although the government is
committed in principle to several large projects of doubtful benefit, their
early implementation is unlikely, given the country economic stringencies and
uncertainty as to the future of the Andean Group.
1.21      Supply, problems have slowed and distorted industrial growth.  The
availability of raw materials for agroindustries, for example, has been
hampered by price controls; by the patterns of land ownership; deficiencies in
storage, refrigeration and transport facilities (both roads and vehicles); and
lack of quality control, packaging materials, credit and technical assistance.
Consequently, investment in a sector where Ecuador has an apparent comparative
advantage has lagged, while industries relying on supplies of readily imported
inputs grew rapidly. Although in overall terms there is abundant labor, in
formal industries its cost has risen faster than productivity. On the other
hand, the relative price of capital has declined, due to concessional
interest rates, the decline in the real exchange rate, import duty exemptions
on machinery, and equipment and tax incentives.
1.22      On the demand side the best prospects seem to lie in breaking out
of the constricted internal market for consumer goods for high income groups.
Faster development of Ecuador's agricultural, forestry, and fishing sectors
would generate demands for low-cost wage goods, with rising purchasing power
in those sectors, and also open opportunities for forward and backward linkages.
Export markets, particularly outside the Andean Group, are practically
untouched. Building on a good resource base, there are manufactured export
possibilities in fruit and vegetable processing, natural colorants (e.g. bixin),
essential oils, spices, pesticides, medicinal extracts, wood products, fibers,
specialized pulp and paper, and fish, shrimp and lobster processing. Cultivation
of shrimp (mainly for export) in artificial ponds is expanding rapidly. Several
financieras have high expectations of using significant amounts of Bank and other
funds for those subprojects and for the forward and backward linkages they open up.
1.23      Growth of GDP is expected to continue decelerating to less than 4% p.a.
(para 1.01); manufacturing should continue to outpace other sectors, although
not to the same degree as in 1979 and 1980. Industrial growth of even 4% p.a.
would generate substantial needs for additional investment. Aggregate



-- 10( -
industrial investment estimates are almost impossible because of a deficient
data base, but a reasonable estimate would be the import of capital goods for
industry in 1979, which exceeded US$567 million on a sharp upward trend.
Taking into account both the real growth of this base, and international
price increases, at 4% p.a. and 8.5% p.a. respectively, industrial investment
could average about US$850 million per year in the 1982-83 period. As presently
conceived about 14% of this total, of which the Bank portion would be about
3.5% (Table 1.5), would be financed under the proposed project.

projects (para. 3.05), the cost per job can be reduced from the average
level for the Fourth Loan (US$41,100) to US$30,000 in spite of the increased
labor costs, approximately 8,000 jobs could be created in the two-year period.
This would represent about 22.7% of the jobs needed for manufacturing to keep
pace with the labor force that is growing at 3.4% p.a.

Il The Financial System 1/
A. Institutional Structure
2.01      The financial system in Ecuador has the following components:  the
monetary autho3riies - the Junta Monetaria (JM) and the Central Bank of
Ecuador (BCE); the supervisory institutions-Superintendency of Banks (SB) and
Superintendency of Companies (SC); 3 government-owned banks and 29 private
commercial banks; the government-owned financiera, Corporacion Financiera
Nacional (CFN)), and 12 private financieras; 11 mutual savings associations;
numerous credit unions; 24 insurance companies; the Ecuadorian Social Security
Institute (IESS); 21 foreign exchange houses; 2 securities exchanges; 4
warehousing firms; 4 leasing companies; and the Ecuadoriaa Institute of
Educational Loans and Fellowships. While financial institutions are concen-
trated in the Guayas and Pichincha provinces, the network of branches and
agencies, especially of banks, cover most of the country's towns and larger
villages. Although economic activity in Guayas province has demanded and
received substantial amounts of credit, Quito remains the major financial
center, mainly due to the location there of BCE and most government functions.
2.02      The monetary and financial policies of Ecuador are established by
the JM and executed by BCE. JM comprises 11 members: the Chairman, appointed
by the President of the Republic; the Ministers of Finance, of Industry,
Commerce and Integration, of Agriculture, and of Natural Resources and Energy;
a representative of the National Development Council (CONADE), and representa-
tives of the two regional Chambers of Industry and Commerce and of commer-
cial banks; the General Manager of BCE and the Superintendent of Banks. BCE,
established in 1927, is charged with administering the JM's monetary and
financial policy decisions.
2.03      The SB, an autonomous entity directed by a Superintendent appointed
by the National Chamber of Representatives, has been developing into an
effective institution for supervising the operations of the financial system.
In-house training programs have been developed for SB staff, who are well-
motivated and eager to learn. Recently a Manual of Inspection has been
developed by the SB with the assistance of the Center of Latinamerican Monetary
Studies and the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. The Manual covers most of
the relevant aspects of financial institutions examination, including organiza-
tional and management issues, and it has been used for training purposes in
the Dominican Republic, Panama and Nicaragua. The Superintendency of Banks
would actively participate in the implementation of the Bank project particu-
larly for supervision of financieras (para 3.19). Technical assistance
would be provided in the project for the Superintendency, both for training
purposes and to develop systems and studies (para. 2.38 and 2.39 and Annex 3).
While the SB supervises most operations of the organized financial system, the
1/   The discussion in this section is based on current prices.  While the
official inflation rate in 1980 was reported around 12.8%, it is estimated
that it may have been at least two points higher.



- 12 -
Superintendency of Companies, established in 1964, is responsible for over-
seeing the operations of the two securities exchanges; securities-related
operations are still very limited (paras. 2.10), but IFC is currently
helping the SC in its efforts to develop the capital market, in particular
trading in stocks.
2.04      Apart from BCE, the National Development Bank (BNF) is the largest
of the Government-owned financial institutions, accounting for 7.1% of
total extension of credit in 1980 (Annex 1, Table 1) and for 10.8% of the
total credit outstanding from all financial institutions (Annex 1, Table 2).
Most of BNF's credit operations are in agriculture and livestock (77%), while
operations in the industrial sector, imainly small scale enterprises, accounted
for 14% (Annex 1, Table 3). Since the i975 oil boom, however, lack of additional
resources and capitalization restricted BNF's portfolio growth (12% p.a.) to
less than half that of all financial institutions (Annex 1, Table 2). Also
owned by the Government, and with 4.2% of the 1980 credit portfolio of all
financial institutions (Annex 1, Table 2), the Ecuadorian Housing Bank (BEV)
mainly provides credit to the housing sector. BEVs credit operations have
been subject to fluctuations (Annex 1, Table 1), roughly parallelled by those
of the 11 mutual savings associations. Established in 1979, the Ecuadorian
Development Bank (BEDE) mainly serves government institutions and programs;
it has an initial paid-in capital of around S/2,200 million. In 1980 BED's
operations amounted to S/a 2,598.5 million, and are expected to increase
substantially in future. Completing the array of government-owned financial
institutions is the Corporacion Financiera Nacional, which is the largest
financiera of the country (paras 2.25-2.31) with 5.6% of the 1980 credit
portfolio of all financial institutions (Annex 1, Table 2). CFN's portfolio
growth matched the overall credit expansion, at about 34% p.a., from 1975 to
1977, but in 1978-80 it fell off sharply to about 5% p.a. as against some 25%
p.a. for the financial sector as a whole. CFN operations (para. 2.25 and
Annex 1, Table 3) concentrate in the industrial sector and export-related
operations.
2.05      The private banking sector accounts for about 67% of the 1980 credit
portfolio and a similar share of the credits granted in that year (Annex 1,
Tables 1 and 2). Bank loans, with average maturity of 11.3 months, have the
most diversified range of applications among the financial intermediaries.
The commercial sector absorbed around 45% of private bank credits in 1980
(Annex 1, Table 3) and industry about 27%; the remaining fourth went to
agriculture and other purposes, including construction and consumer finance.
Since 1975 the portfolios of banks have been growing at an average of 31%
p.a., roughly paralleling the amount of credit extension by all financial
institutions but advancing more rapidly than the aggregate from a 1978 trough.
The growth of bank lending has been made possible by the increase in demand
deposits and by credits from BCE. Ecuadorian banks predominate, only 4 of
the 29 private banks being foreign bank subsidiaries.  New entrants and more
aggresive competition for deposits and clients have been challenging the
dominance of the oldest established banks,



- 13 -
2.06      The financieras (Section D) have consistently, since 1974, experienced
a faster growth of their credit portfolios than those of other financial institu-
tions (Annex 1, Table 2). CFN expanded its operations very rapidly in the
earlier years of this period, but slowed after 1977, while the private finan-
cieras continued to maintain a growth rate of about 50% p.a. through 1980.
This was sustained by expansion of the private financieras' capital base by
about 56% p.a. and by credit extended from BCE. COFIEC was joined by nine
other private financieras during this peiods. 1/ By the end of 1980 the private
financieras' credit portfolio was 8.3% of the total for all financial insti-
tutions, exceeding that of CFN, and their credit volume was 20.4% of the total
(Annex 1, Table 1). Financieras' high proportion of credit volume relative to
aggregate portfolio is due to the mostly short-term maturity of their credits,
around 9.2 months. The private financieras operate mainly in the industrial
sector, which absorbed 52.9% of the total volume of credit in 1980 (Annex 1,
Table 3), preponderantly to finance working capital. About 15% of their
credits went to agriculture, 6.9% to trading activities and the remaining
24.8% to other sectors, mainly construction and services. In the last two
years, some of the private financieras have been expanding operations in the
agriculture sector, in part due to the availability of CBE credits through the
rediscount of Development Bonds and to their participation in Bank agricultural
credits.
2.07      Mutual Saving Associations also substantially increased their credit
during the 1970s, outpacing other institutions through 1975 but slowing to an
average of 23% p.a. in 1978-80. The initial growth rate of Mutual Associations
was from a low level of balances in the early 1970s, and was due to the
financial assistance provided by BEV and an aggressive mobilization strategy
based on the offer of mortgage loans to depositors. After 1972 no new Associa-
tions were formed, and in 1979 four of the eleven institutions held around 82%
of the total Mutual Savings portfolio. The Associations are not allowed to
issue bonds or financial certificates. Individual deposits are still very
small, an average of S/16,500 (US$660) per associate, while the average loan
has been S/381,000 (USS$15,200) - allowing one mortgage loan per 23 associates.
In 1980, the credit volume of Mutual Saving Associations was only 0.9% while
credit balances were 4.5% of the system total (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2).
2.08      One-third of the 24 private insurance firms currently operating
in the country are branches of foreign companies, the rest Ecuadorian.
Besides insurance protection, they provide small amounts of credit to their
clients; in 1979 this amounted only to around US$1.5 million. In the same
year insurance company investments in securities, both debt instruments and
shares, amounted to S/773 million, equivalent to about 8% of the debt securities
outstanding at the time (Annex 1, Table 4). More significant in this regard
is the Social Security Institute (IESS) which provides credit to the govern-
ment sector and to lESS affiliates, mainly for housing. By 1979 IESS held
more than S/6,500 million in mortgage bonds and loans to its affiliates.
IESS constitutes the principal organized market for mortgage bonds of commer-
cial banks (holding 75% of those outstanding) and is thus able strongly to
influence their prices and yields. In future, the expansion of medical
assistance to its affiliates, and consequent increased claims on its resources,
together with the financing needs of the public sector will reduce IESS
participation in the mortgage bond market.
1/   Two more financieras were formed in 1981.



'- 14s - 
2.09      The 21 foreign exchange houses, small and profitable institutions,
had in 1979 total assets of around S/200 million. Their transactions,
amounting to about S/16,000 million, were mainly (about 93%) in US Dollars
and US Dollar travellers checks. Other specialized institutions include four
warehousing firms, mainly providing depository services and storage/distribution
facilities; on a minor scale, they also provide short-term financing operations
with merchandise guarantees. In 1979 total assets of the warehousing firms
were around S/358 million, and the volume of merchandise deposited about
S/2,200 million. IECE is an institution providing loans for educational
purposes; in 1979 its total assets were around S/93 million.
2.10      Transactions on the securities exchanges in Quito and Guayaquil
were around S/9,608 million in 1980, almost equally divided between the
two; 81% of the transactions were in government and BCE securities (55% were
BCE's Bonos de Estabilizacion Monetaria), the remainder mostly in mortgage
bonds, with insignificant trading (0.2%) in stocks. The 1979 volume of
transactions represented 72.5% of the debt securities outstanding. However,
for stabilization bonds the trading volume was four times the amounts outstand-
ing, mainly due to the short (30 to 180 day) maturity of the bonds; on the
other hand, only 18% of mortgage bonds, were traded and trading represented
only 64% of the increase in mortgaLge bonds. These statistics suggest that not
all new issues are negotiated in the exchanges, while the organized secondary
market remains very limited. The latter deficiency is a major handicap
to savings mobilization through issuance of debt securities.
2.11      Finally, the rigidity of the interest rate structure (para.
2.14) and the unsatisfied demand for credit contributed to the establishment
of small finance companies, outside the traditional financiera pattern and
the control of monetary authorities, to provide consumer credit and finance
machinery for industry and agriculture. It is estimated that by 1978 these
institutions had around S/150 million (US$6 million) in their portfolio -
the equivalent of around 0.2% of total credit balances of the financial
system - 65% financing industrial and agricultural machinery and buildings,
the remainder used for acquisition of cars and trucks and travel expenditures.
The growth of these companies occurresd mainly in 1975 and was reduced to 18%
p.a. in the 1976-1978 period. Monetary authorities are currently studying
ways to control these marginal finance companies.
B. Regulations
2.12      JM and BCE's main policy instruments, used regularly to
control the growth of monetary aggregates and the operation of financial
institutions, are:
(a) reserve requirements, currently 26% on demand deposits,
and 10% of Mutual Savings Associations' deposits (in 1980,
however, a liquidity shortage reduced actual bank reserves
to 23.7% and those of Mutual Savings Associations to 8.2%);
(b) portfolio growth ceilings imposed on an ad hoc basis for banks,
and recently for a short time on financieras as well;



- 15 -
(c)  open market and credit operations to stabilize the growth
of monetary aggregates;
(d)  interest rate ceilings and commissions (para. 2.14); and
(e)  control of foreign exchange operations (para. 2.13) and
management of international reserves.
In addition, JM and BCE have established minimum capital requirements for
financial institutions (basically S/20 million for banks and SilO million for
financieras); a maximum leverage position (debt-to-equity ratio of 15 times
for banks and 10 times for financieras); and maximum claims on a single
borrower (less than 10% of equity of banks and less than 25% of financieras'
equity). BCE has direct control over a substantial share of the country's
financial savings, which it allocates among the various lending institutions
and objects of credit (para. 2.22).
2.13      Denominating loans in foreign currencies is prohibited except when
they originate from international transactions. This has encourage the growth
of guarantees financed from foreign bank credit lines by Ecuadorian financial
institutions (para. 2.24). In these operations customers pay higher interest
rates and are exposed to foreign exchange risks, but thereby obtain substantial
supplementary resources.
2.14      Interest Rate Structure:  Traditionally, interest policy has consisted
of fixed rates supplemented by commissions. The basic rates vary with the
maturity and nature of operations, and by credit programs and institutions
(Table 2.1). The fixed rate structure, not subject to variation in response
to availability of loanable funds and usually lower than market equilibrium
rates, has resulted in credit rationing and encouraged emergence of an
unorganized market (para. 2.11) at higher rates. The interest ceilings also
have tended to discourage investors from holding debt instruments and lenders
from intermediation through conventional institutions (para. 2.20). Thus, in
general these policies have been detrimental to an efficiently functioning
financial system, and to competition among financial institutions, in partic-
ular financieras, given the fixing of spreads. The rigid interest rate
structure, combined with a fixed US/Sucre exchange rate could encourage
capital flight; through 1980 there was little evidence of this - the inter-
national reserves both of BCE and of the whole banking system increasing
during 1975-1980, at 28.4% and 29.4% p.a. respectively, reaching 36% in
1979-1980 - but early 1981 saw substantial outflows, occasioned in part by the
hostilities with Peru and interest rate differentials.

2.15      On March 18, 1981, after lengthy discussion among its members,
JM adjusted the interest rates for borrowing and lending operations, including
commissions. 1/ The regulations are subject to different interpretations, and
doubts have been expressed about the v&lIdity of some aspects that may contra-
vene basic laws, but the main rates and commissions, as adjusted, are shown in
Table 2.1. The maxilmum nominal intereat rate for lending is 15% p.a. for
operations with maturity more than 2 years. Adding allowable commissions
the official effective lending rate on medium- and loing-term loan is 16-17%,
and 17.5-18.5% when the lending operations are financed by bonds. This
represents an increase of 2 percentage points from the previous rates for
loans of 5 years maturity, and 1 percentage point for those above 5 years.
Bonds are sold at discount to improve their yield to holders.  On March 31, 1981,
mortgage bonds with maturities varying from 2 to 10 years were still nominally
yielding between 13.5% and 15.5% p.a., (11.1% and 12.7% after tax) and tax
exempt stabilization bonds were yielding between 8.6% and 12% with maturities
ranging from 30 to 180 days.  On June 21, 1981, however, the government issued
5-year bonds bearing a 15% coupon. The inflation rate last year was officially
around 13%, and is currently estimated at perhaps 15% p.a.; hence the current
government borrowings are at a rate marginally positive in real terms. However,
their effect on resource mobilization efforts by banks and financieras could be
very damaging since the new bonds' tax-free yield equals the recently in-
creased maximum rate for mortgage bonds, interest on which is subject to tax;
the latter could presumably be sold only at steep discounts the cost of which
would have to be passed on to borrowers. If the government expects the
financieras to mobilize significant amounts of long term resources, it should
accord parity in tax treatment as well as in interest rates to these institutions'
issues.
2.16      The March 1981 adjustments in the interest rate structure did not
change the 4% p.a. commission allowed for guarantees and for lending operations
originating from letters of credit, leaving financieras higher margins for such
operations than for loans. However, they are not permitted to write guarantees
in excess of 4.5 times their equity and letter of credit loans in excess of
3.5 times, whereas other loans may be made up to a total of 10 times equity.
Thus once a financieras has reached its legal limits (as is the case for most
of them) it can further expand its operations only as its equity capital is
increased; and the added leeway gained thereby has a multiplier of 10 if used
for loans but only 4.5 for guarantees and 3.5 for letter of credit loans.
Still, up to this lower limit the financial incentives favor such opera-
tions over lending financed from bonds and the proposed Loan.
2.17      Another of the rate adjustments puts financieras into competion
with banks for funds under fixed term contracts for deposit above 270 days
maturity. The issuance of bonds, nominally of long term, with a repurchase
agreement that effectively make them payab,e on demand, is now greatly
restricted; this practice resulted in a mismatch in the structure of assets
and liabilities oL at least one financiera. However, given the virtual
absence of secondary markets (para. 2e10)), the prospective response of
investors to future security issues under the new regulations is still
uncertain.

- 18 -
2.18      It is still too early to determine the effect of the March 1981
regulations. Some Ecuadorian investors consider that they simply reflect the
actual market yields. Others consider that more basic reforms in the system,
going beyond mere adjustment of permitted interest rates, will be necessary
for substantially more ample and reliable mobilization of resources for
investment (paras. 2.22 and 2.37). However, the Government considers that
more basic reforms of interest rates at this time would involve a major
political risk. Nevertheless, some of the current limitations of the interest
rate structure are recognized. The review of the effect of the March 1981
regulations could lead to additional reforms.  During loan administration the
behavior of the financial system, in particular regarding resource mobilization
for long term lending, will be reviewed to determine whether further measures
may be required (para 4.07).
C. Financial Savings and Credit
2.19      During the period 1975-1980, after the inception of the oil boom,
the total of financial savings (including net deposits of the government) was
growing faster (at 27.4% p.a.) than the average growth rate of the economy
(21.4% p.a.) (Table 2.2 and Annex 1, Table 4). The growth of net government
deposits (52.3% p.a.), largely resulting from oil revenues, was a major
factor; they increased from 2.7% of all financial resources made available to
the financial system in 1976 to 9.2% in 1980. Non-specified liabilities and
equity of financial institutions also increased their share of total financial
savings, contributing strongly to the growth of the system. These increases
were spurred by the attractive return on investment in financial institutions,
especially banks and some financieras, vis-a-vis other financial instruments.
Financieras experienced the most dramatic gains in capital, with an average
growth rate of 56% p.a. during 1975-1980, while that for banks was 32.9% p.a.
The share of private capital in total financial savings reached 10.4% at
the end of 1980, up from 7% in 1976.

2.20      The expansion of stabilization bonds also was rapid (34.4% p.a.)
but from a low base, so that their 1980 share in total financial savings was
still only 1.3% in 1980.. The growth rate for debt securities other than
stabilization bonds was lower, roughly 20% p.a., their share in total financial
savings declining from about 12% to under 10%. This lower growth rate has
been due in part to interest rate controls that resulted in portfolio shifts
from debt instruments into higher yielding investments-e.g. shares of financial
institutions whichr in 1980 yielded an average of 26% for banks, ranging
up to 60%; and 18%'for financieras, writh some close to 27%.  Such shares are
also more marketable than bonds, except stabilization bonds. The growth rate
of savings and time deposits (19.6% p.a.) has also been lower than average
and by 1980 their share of all financial savings had fallen to 14.4%; the
share of currency in circulation aLnd demand deposits was also reduced, to
39.2%. This may have resulted from arnti-inflationary monetary restrictions
that limited the growth of the commercial banks' portfolio, the slackening of
overall economic growth, and the more attractive returns from real estate and
shares of financial institutions.
2.21      The ratio of financial savings, including government deposits,
to GDP at around 37% shows (Table 2.2) a still low level of intermediation
and financial development relative to other Latin American countries (Annex 1,
Table 5). Only about 34.8% of real savings (Table 2.2) are intermediated
through the financial markets. This is further reflected in the fact that
loans from non-related parties to firms reporting to the Superintendency of
Companies are only about 38% of their total assets, which suggests that
financing needs of the corporate sector are still met substantially from
internal sources. On the other hand, the proportion of real saving to GDP
(22.8%) is around the average for middle income and industrialized countries.
Even if the share of real saving does not rise substantially, there is consid-
erable scope for increased intermediation and improved efficiency and effec-
tiveness in the financial markets.
2.22      BCE's predominant role in the operations of the financial system
is due in part to the large share of financial savings under its control,
around 45% in 1980, (Annex 1, Table 4). Although a substantial portion (over
20%) of these resources are net government deposits, most come from the
financial sector largely in the form of required reserves. BCE reallocates
these funds by transfer through designated financial institutions for
specified purposes - to commerce 32.7%, industry 33.9%, agriculture 15.3% and
other sectors 18.1% in 1980 (Annex 1, Table 3). It is questionable whether
this method of directed allocation oE credit resources makes optimal use of
them, in particular the agricultural sector seems relatively disfavored.
Certainly it hampers the development and efficiency of financial intermedia-
tion. In the future BCE might better devote its efforts and resources to
promoting secondary markets for financial instruments and to more consistent
policies for controlling inflation.
2.23      The savings made available to the organized financial system allowed
it to finance around S/86 billion of credit operations in 1980 with about
S/100 billion in credit balances (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2). The credit
balances of all the system grew at an average rate of about 28% p.a. during
1975-1980 (slightly faster than financial savings), roughly the same rate as



21 -
in the previous 5 year period. Credit volume grew at a slightly lower rate
(26%) due to a slight lengthening of maturities. Still the average maturity of
credits remains short (11 months) reflecting the short-term character of
resources and credit requirements of the commercial sector. While private
bank credit has had about the same average maturity as that of the financial
system as a whole, private financieras have engaged mainly in shorter term
operations averaging around 9 months. Contributing factors are the low
margins that can be earned on long term resources; the ready availability of
BCE funds; the absence of secondary markets to enhance the liquidity of debt
instruments, the fact that private firms are accustomed to finance their
long-term needs internally or through rollover of short-term loans; and the
unattractiveness of yields on long-term debt instruments relative to equities
and real estate. Future growth of long-term resource availability depends on
making suitable financial instruments attractive to investors - inter alia by
introducing more flexibility in interest rate policy, promoting secondary
markets and adjusting tax and other incentives.
2.24      Contingent operations are an important addition to the credit balances
shown in Annex 1, Table 2, which amounted to S/33,461.8 million in 1980, 33% of
the total; of which 76.3% of all guarantees were by private banks and 23.2% by
financieras (including CFN); 60% consisted of guarantees financed by foreign
banks through short and medium term credit lines. Thus, in addition to the
credit portfolio of the entire financial system, at least a further 20% equiva-
lent entered the economy financed by foreign sources with Ecuadorian guarantees.
For private banks contingent operations amounted to the equivalent of 38% of
their credit balances, and for CFN and private financieras 15% and 80% respec-
tively. Private financieras, therefore, are heavily dependent on foreign
banks, and to a lesser extent on BCE for their resources.
D. Financieras
Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN)
2.25      CFN, Ecuador's oldest and largest financiera, is wholly owned by the
government but mainly finances the private industrial sector. In its day-to-day
operations it enjoys considerable autonomy but its Board of Directors, seven
of whom are Ministers of State, sets overall policy. CFN is headed by a
General Manager, who exercises authority through a strong management structure
consisting of an Assistant General Manager and departmental and divisional
managers. The last three years have been difficult ones for CFN, which has
responded by attempting to consolidate its activities. Thus it has sharply
reduced the growth rate of both assets and staff, drastically curtailing
the expansionary trend of 1974-77 (Annex 1, Table 6); its share of total
assets of financieras has dropped correspondingly.
2.26      Operations.  CFN's loan portfolio, the largest component of total
assets, has remained roughly constant in real terms since 1978. Its term
structure and funding have been shifting to a pattern somewhat more like other
financieras. In the last two years, CFN has dropped the practice, long of
concern to the Bank, of partially funding long-term, fixed rate Sucre loans with



-- 22 -
floating rate foreign exchange borrowiLngs. In order to reduce losses (para.
2.29) it has been making more use of BCE resources and has increased short
term lending. Nevertheless, long term lending remains its principal activity.
Resources available to CFN for this purpose would be reinforced under the
proposed loan by access to Bank funds and to cofinancing, and by increased
mobilization of domestic savings. To the latter end, the government has
agreed to ensure CFN's access to loca:L and foreign sources of financing.
2.27      Equity investments, CFN's second most important line, have been
growing more rapidly than total portfolio, due mainly to government pressures
that CFN's management has not successfully resisted. Many of these investments
are, at best, financially precarious (AZTRA and Selva Alegre) and some (e.g.
Ecuasider and Coordinauto, companies to organize a steel mill and automobile
manufacture) seem dubious from the economic viewpoint as well. None of the
new investments, however, are in violation of the Fourth Loan covenant
limiting exposure in a single firm, 1/ which has probably had a restraining
effect. CFN's management needs to screen equity investment proposals more
carefully and firmly reject those that do not have sufficient possibilities
of return to justify the risk.
2.28      Although it charged less than market rates until recently, CFN has
not been able to increase its guarantee and letter of credit business,
whose volume in real terms has fallen 23% in the last 3 years. In part this
reflects a failure to market these facilities aggreasively. Clients express
reluctance to accept "expensive" resources from CFN (although they accept them
from other financieras) believing that CFN should provide "cheap" money.
Also, CFN's internal procedures for dealing with guarantees handicap it in
relation to private financieras. CFN is attempting to overcome these problems
and expects to make much greater use of guarantees and letters of credit in
the future.
2.29      Profitability.  CFN's rate of return on equity declined steadily
from 1975 through 1979, when it lost US$2.6 million equivalent (Annex 1, Table 7).
Its gross spread fell mainly because the cost of its foreign commercial
borrowings rose faster than the yield on its portfolio, the latter being
affected by the unprofitable investments in AZTRA and Selva Alegre (para.
2.27). Large provisions for possible loan and investment portfolio losses
also imposed a drain on profits. Losses of US$6.0 million were initially
forecast for 1980, but several circumstances resulted in a small profit.
First, CFN negotiated larger credit lines, with attractive margins, from BCE,
and increased the efficiency and volume of its use of BCE resources for FOPEX,
a line of subsidized export financing. Second, CFN reduced its foreign
exchange obligations, and fortunately several of the semestral interest rate
fixings fell during the mid-1980 trough in interest rates. Third, CFN increased
its commissions on guarantees and letters of credit from 1% to 2% p.a., and in
June 1981 to 3-4% p.a., approximating market levels as required by earlier
agreement with the Bank. Finally, the average interest rate on its long term

loan portfolio is gradually rising as old, 12% loans are being replaced with
14-16% loans. The new interest rates established in March 1981, up to 17%
p.a., will contribute to a further rise in portfolio yield but could be more
than offset by a corresponding rise in interest expense. A solution to the
AZTRA and Selva Alegre problems (para. 2.31) should dramatically improve CFN's
profitability, both by raising its return on assets and by eliminating the
need for extra-ordinarily large provisions against loss. Nevertheless, to
achieve the minimal goal of protecting the real value of its equity CFN will
have: (a) further to increase gross margins by continuing to charge full
market rates for its financial services; (b) emphasize profitable lines of
activity; (c) continue close control of administrative costs; (d) increase its
leverage; and (e) improve its financial management. To help CFN design and
implement a computer-based accounting, budgeting, and financial information
system US$100,000 in technical assistance would be provided to CFN in these
areas.
2.30      Financial Condition.  The two major threats to CFN's financial
condition identified at the time of the Fourth Loan were its exposure to
foreign exchange risk on external borrowings and its investments in large,
unprofitable public sector enterprises (AZTRA and Selva Alegre). CFN agreed
to prepare programs acceptable to the Bank to deal with these problems.
In both cases the CFN proposals were inadequate; however, they helped to
define the issues and to reduce CFN's consequent foreign exchange exposure
from US$130.8 million in 1978 to US$114.6 million in 1980 - which, at 1.5
times CFN's equity, is still excessive. One of the technical assistance
components of proposed loan could help carry out a study of possible means
to minimize CFN's (and other financieras') exchange risk problems (Annex 3).
Under the Fourth Loan the government agreed to reimburse CFN for foreign
exchange losses arising from past, but not new, foreign borrowing. This
agreement is carried over into the proposed loan. CNF has agreed to a
freeze on further borrowing from foreign sources which exposes it to sub-
stantial foreign exchange risk.
2.31      CFN has made provisions from its own earnings equal to almost 10%
of its equity holdings of AZTRA and Selva Alegre which amount to almost
US$37.0 million, but any definitive solution of this issue must come from the
government. The problems of the two companies derive in large part from
controlled prices for sugar and cement, and from political interference in
management. The government understands the causes and is seeking a fundamental
solution which would restore both companies to profitability and eventually
permit their sale to private investors. The Bank strongly encourages such a
solution but has also stressed the view that pending its achievement CFN
should be relieved of the financial burden of these two investments. The
substantial price increases for sugar and cement undertaken by the government
could facilitate the sale of the two firms. CFN would also receive US$20.0
million to enable it to make an adequate provision for these investments,
pending their sale. Final agreement on the timing of this transfer were
reached at negotiations. On its part CFN will undertake a review with its
auditors to determine if all US$20.0 million or more or less should be added
to its provisions for loss. To help prevent similar problems the government
agreed in the future to limit CFN's exposure to a single firm to 10% of its
equity except when adequately protected from the additional risk by a mechanism
satisfactory to the Bank. Finally, CFN agreed to annually establish adequate
provisions in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and take into account the
opinions of the auditors.

- ivate Financieras
2.32      The private financieras are among the most important sources of
institutional finance to the industrial sector, accounting in 1980 for over
35% of credits to that sector (Annex 1, Table 3). Most of the financieras are
based in the two main industrial and commercial centers, Quito and Guayaquil,
while FIDASA has its headquarters in Cuenca. 1/ The recently established
MANABI and FINANSUR focus on the regions around Manta and Machala respectively.
Headquartered in Quito, COFIEC, FINIBER, FINANSA, and FINANDES have about 65% of
total assets and contingent operations of all private financieras. The
largest and most mature institution, COFIEC, controls around 33% of all
private financieras' assets and contingent operations. 2/ The second largest
private financiera is FINANSA with 17%, while FINIBER and FINANDES have 10% and
5% respectively. The Guayaquil group - GUAYAQUIL, ECUFINSA, FINANSUR,
AMERAFIN - have 16%, 10%, 3% and 3% respectively, of total assets and contin-
gencies of private financieras. FIDASA in Cuenca and MANABI in Manta 3/ are
the smallest of the private financieras, each with less than 2% of total
assets and contingencies (Annex 1, Table 8).
2.33      Along with CFN, private financieras basically provide credit to the
industrial sector (Annex 1, Table 2) 78% of which is for working capital.
Recently, however, they have been expanding their credits to the agricultural
sector. Since mid-1982 they have become very active in the Bank's SSI Loan,
having used about 75% of the resources thus far committed. Only COFIEC and
FINANSA have equity investments, around 2% of their total assets and contingent
operations. COFIEC also has provided significantly more direct credit with
maturities longer than one year (19.2% of total assets and contingent operations)
than the other financieras. FINANSA has the largest portion of its portfolio
in contingent operations (54%), while MANABI and FIDASA have only limited
contingent operations probably due to the lack of foreign bank financing.
MANABI and FIDASA have also a relatively high liquid position, due in part to
their less aggressive strategy. FINIBER is probably the most aggressive and
fastest growing of all the private financieras, followed by GUAYAQUIL and
ECUFINSA. The growth of FINANSA has been slow in the last year, partly due to
some liquidity constraints and a major change in its shareholders. With new
management ECUFINSA is revamping its lending strategy. MANABI's strategy
calls for expansions in such secondary cities as Manta, Loja, and Riobamba.
Recently formed FINANSUR, AMERAFIN, FINEC, and REPUBLICA are still looking for
a particular niche in the the market. Among the latest additions, FINANSUR
seems the most aggressive; FINANDES and FIDASA have grown least rapidly.
2.34      As regards borrowing operations, only COFIEC and FINANSA have issued
a limited amount of bonds and only COFIEC has issued financial certificates.
1/   See Glossary for full names of the financieras.
2/   CFN, however, has assets about 1.6 times larger than COFIEC.
Headquartered in Quito, it has offices in all principal cities
of the country.
3/   Officially headquartered in Manta, MANABI's principal office
is located in Quito.  Still more recently formed, and just
initiating operations, are FINEC in Quito and REPUBLICA in
Guayaquil.



- 25 -
Some financieeas have also issued development bonds, which are basically
discounts with BCE and therefore are not considered debt securities. COFIEC,
and to some extent MANABI, are the only financieras with a substantial
proportion of loan resources with maturities above one year. Contingent opera-
tions, rediscounts, acceptances, and letters of credit in aggregate make up
most of the liabilities of financieras. COFIEC, FINIBER, FINANSA, GUAYAQUIL
and ECUFINSA are already at or close to the legal debt-to-equity ratio (10:1).
The newest financieras, together with FIDASA, have not yet been able to obtain
foreign banks support that would enable them to increase their leverage position.
FIDASA's location in Cuenca isolates it from visits of foreign banks representa-
tives. Moreover, it has no predominant private group among its sponsors - its
major shareholder, with about 25% of equity, is CFN - which tends to make it
less aggressive. With the exception of COFIEC, and to some extent FIDASA,
most of the private financieras have played an insignificant role in mobilizing
domestic resources except through their own equity. Their resources are
provided overwhelmingly by BCE and foreign banks (Annex 1, Table 9).
2.35      The management organization of most private financieras is small and
very simple, usually revolving around a few key professionals with experience
drawn from COFIEC and CFN. Their management information systems, except for
COFIEC and FINIBER, are in process of development. Most of the professionals
working in the financieras are schooled in international banking operations and
commercial banking-type analysis, although the top manager and/or a few at
middle level have some experience in project appraisals. Only COFIEC has a
full project analysis department, while FINANSA, ECUFINSA, FIDASA, GUAYAQUIL,
and MANABI have at least one officer working on project appraisal. Most
financieras expect to increase their medium and long term operations and
propose to build up their project appraisal capabilities. All operate under
Policy Statements acceptable to the Bank or would adopt such Statements as a
condition of participation in the proposed loan.
2.36      Most of the financieras work with tight liquid resources; the overall
current ratio is around 1.3 for the oldest financieras and about 1.8 for the
new ones. All private financieras except COFIEC finance part of their loan
portfolio from equity. COFIEC uses part of its equity and some liabilities to
finance equity investments and real estate holdings. The profitability of
financieras has been lower than that of banks, due to their fast growing
capitalization. In 1980, excluding MANABI which was starting operations, the
private financieras earned an average return on equity around 18% with a range
of 6-27%, the newest at the lower end of the scale (Annex 1, Table 10). Account-
ing conventions make the actual average interest earned and cost of funds
difficult to ascertain precisely, but it is estimated that their average gross
spread is around 3.5 to 4.0%. Administrative expenses including taxes and
provisions for losses are roughly 2.2% of total assets and contingencies.
E. Issues and Outlook
2.37      The financial system of Ecuador has been growing inadequately
given the expansion of the economy, in a period of relative political sta-
bility. The efficiency of the system in allocating resources needs to be



- 26 -
improved, in spite of recent reforms, through allowing greater scope for market
forces in interest rate policy, the promotion of secondary markets for financial
(especially debt) instruments and revision of policies throughout the economy
that may discourage securities investments. The predominant role of BCE in
credit allocation should be de-emphasized, and it should r,ive more attention
to creating and strengthening secondary markets for financial instruments,
fostering competition among financial institutions and expanding their role
as investment bankers. So long as secondary markets are lacking the effects
of a market-oriented interest rate policy may be limited.  With real savings
approximating the share of GDP found iLn other middle-income and industrialized
countries, the most promising means of- increasing financial savings, in
particular debt securities, would be through portfolio shifts by investors
from non-financial to financial assets. The share of real saving of the economy
going into financial savings, i.e. intermediation, would have to be increased.
Dialogue between the Bank and the monetary authorities on these issues would
occur in the context, inter alia, of the interest rate review provided for in
the proposed loan (para 4.07).
2.38      The financieras remain important channels and allocators of resources
to the industrial sector. However, their intermediation function is still
very limited, mainly as a result of the market constraints noted above.  The
conditions for access to resources under the proposed loan (para 3.16) would
provide an additional incentive for resource mobilization. Although the top
managers of financieras are generally experienced and able professionals,
project appraisal capabilities need to be developed further. The advisory
services in project appraisal methodology and practices, proposed to be
financed under the Loan, should help to further this end (para 3.20). The
average level of profitability of all the private financieras, depressed by
those recently established and by the continuous rapid capitalization of most
of them, still is acceptable; and the more aggressive and efficient financieras
are showing attractive profits. Their earning potential, given current
monetary policies, is still high. Further development of management control
systems and improved financial programming would increase their efficiency.
The technical assistance programs through the Superintendency of Banks (Annex
3) may help to train financieras' financial managers and improve their opera-
tional effectiveness, especially in follow-up of subproject implementation;
certainly it should strengthen the supervisory capabilities of the Super-
intendency's own staff. Bank staff are already assisting the SB in carrying-
out the training program.
2.39      Improvements to the data base and statistics of the financial
system, the accounting and auditing practices of financial institutions,
and other operational practices of financieras need to be examined,  A program
of studies and development of information systems (Annex 3) has been confirmed.
during negotiations. Bank staff are already assisting the SB in planning the
particular studies to be included in the program and preparing terms of
reference; as usual the Bank would comment on results of the studies and means
of implementing their findings.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Previous Loans
3.01      Since 1971 the Bank has made four loans to Ecuador for development
banking projects, using financieras as intermediaries, for a total of US$86.0
million. Only CFN and COFIEC participated in the first two of these loans; in
the third and fourth, other more recently formed financieras participated to a
limited extent. A further loan designed specifically to reach smaller clients
(SSEs) has recently become effective and is being committed rapidly; a second
SSE project will be appraised in early FY1982. 1/ The Fourth Loan was fully
committed in December 1980; fifty percent of the Fourth Loan amount was
disbursed by July 1981, only 10 months after effectiveness.
3.02      Eight new financieras (in addition to CFN and COFIEC) were
reviewed for participation under the Fourth Loan and six were found eligible
to participate. 2/ Because of vigorous demand it became apparent that the
entire loan might be committed by COFIEC and CFN before the new financieras
could act. Therefore the government requested and the Bank agreed to reserve
US$7.0 million for new financieras until December 1980, on a first-come, first-
served basis. Three of the new financieras committed these funds for nine
subprojects, including one particularly labor-intensive fish export venture.
The inclusion of the new financieras, one of the purposes of the Fourth Loan,
contributed to the achievement of other objectives as well - e.g., broadening
of the aggregate clientele, and increased attention to the need of smaller
firms and more backward regions.
3.03      The characteristics of subloans financed under the first three
loans were summarized in the SAR for the Fourth Loan (Report No. 24146-EC,
dated May 31, 1979--Tables 9 and 10 of Annex 4). A revised tabulation for
the Third Loan--including the final commitments made under it, several by
the newer financieras as well as by CFN--is shown in Table 3.1, together
with comparative data for 41 subprojects approved under the Fourth Loan.
The data of Table 3.1 are based on subproject appraisal estimates made by the
financieras; it is still too early to assess actual results. The appraisals
were, however, reviewed in the Bank--especially those for subloans exceeding
the free limit--and were considered generally reasonable.
1/   Eligible intermediaries under the SSE loan 1879-EC comprise commercial
banks as well as the financieras, with the latter using about 75% of
the amounts committed to date.
2/   The major factor impeding the other financieras was their inability
or unwillingness to commit themselves to raise the proportion of
medium and long term operations in their portfolios to at least 20% by
December 1981.

3.04      The commitments under all four loans are for a diversity of
industrial subsectors, but with a concentration in textiles, clothing and
leather goods through the Third Loan. 1/ Metal products manufacture has
received an important proportion of the first two loans and of the fourth,
little of the third, while the share accorded to chemical/plastic industries
rose progressively, to 23.3% of the Fourth Loan.
3.05      The averages for size of subloan, for total subproject cost and
investment per job are all substantially lower in Fourth Loan commitments
than in the Third. This is doubtless due in part to the US$3 million limit
on maximum use of Bank funds by a single firm that was set for the Fourth Loan.
It may also reflect participation in the loan by some of the newer financieras;
subloans presented by them, as a group, under the Third Loan were much smaller,
and under the Fourth Loan somewhat smaller, than those of COFIEC and (especially)
CFN. However, the Fourth Loan cost per job, at a US$41,000 average, is still
high relative to Ecuador's per capita income and savings. 2/ The share of
export production subprojects, in which the projected investment per job was
only about one-seventh of that in import-substitution industries, also increased
from the Third to the Fourth Loan, from a low base percentage. Because export
projects tend to be more labor intensive 'para. 1.12) US$20.0 million of the pro-
posed loan would be reserved for subproject-8 exporting more than 50% of their
gross output.
3.06      Some deficiencies in ERR calculations have come to light.  In
order to remedy them and to improve the analysis, the following adjustments
will be made in implementation of the Fifth Loan:
(a) financieras will provide a special explanation of the method
of estimating border prices of important subproject inputs or
outputs whenever they are subject to quantitative import
restriction or tariffs greater than 25%;
(b) financieras will spell out the procedures used on each subproject
for procurement, and explain the extent to which consideration
is given to more labor-intensive technological alternatives;
(c) because of inflation the limit below which ERR analysis will be
required would be raised from US$150,000 to US$300,000 for Bank-
financed subprojects and from US$500,000 to US$1,000,000 on other
subprojects regardless of the source of funds, with no ERR required
for pure working capital loans (non-Bank); and
(d) technical assistance (para 3.20) will be provided to the finan-
cieras, particularly the new ones, in making financial and
economic analyses of projects.
1/   These categories were consistently preponderant recipients of Bank funds
prior to the Fourth Loan, accounting for 37.1% of commitments under the
first two and 56.5% under the Third. Their Fourth Loan share, within the
41 subprojects analyzed, is 19.6%.
2/   By comparison, however, projects receiving benefits under Ecuador's
Industrial Development Law have an average cost per job of US$61,300.



- 3C -
3.07      Permanent working capital made up about 15% of total project
costs, under the Fourth Loan.  About 51% of total cost consisted of foreign
exchange of which the Bank financed about half. The financieras' own funds,
other financial institutions and project sponsors contributed over US$100
million to complement the US$40 million Bank loan.  The magnitude of the
mobilization of complementary resources puts into perspective the relative
failure to achieve the specific goals of resource mobilization through the
financieras that the Fourth Loan aimed at (para 3.09).
3.08      While the trends of labor/capital utilization and of export
orientation are encouraging, financiera credits under the Fourth Loan have
still supported mainly a rather capital-intensive import-substituting segment
of industry. Loan 1879-EC targetted specifically at SSEs offsets this bias
to some extent and early results are very encouraging. Nevertheless,
the typical estimates of ERR have been high, mostly well over 20% albeit
lower for Fourth than for Third Loan subprojects--still with only one under
15%. In most cases the projected finarcial return (FRR) exceeds the ERR, as
a result of the industrial protection/incentive system.
3.09      Progress in resource mobilization and in dialogue on financial
reforms fell far short of the objectives of the Fourth Loan. Under the
Fourth Loan the BCE and the Bank were to have discussed financial reforms
through a series of studies to be conducted by BCE's Capital Market Study
Unit. This unit was caught up in a general reorganization of BCE and was
assigned data gathering and reporting tasks. Consequently, studies were not
conducted according to a timetable and under terms of reference agreed with
the Bank as expected. The Bank did see and comment on some unofficial proposals
that led up to the 1981 changes (para 2.15). The lack of earlier and more far
reaching reforms is the main reason for the difficulties that these financieras
had in issuing bonds and certificates to the public. Under the proposed loan,
a review of interest rates and other conditions bearing on the financieras'
ability to mobilize resources would be conducted before more than half of the
proposed loan could be committed (paras 2.18, 2.37 and 4.07).
3.10      Under the Fourth Loan, as in the proposed loan, the financieras had
to mobilize complementing resources to use Bank funds according to a matching
formula. Because the increase in the equity of both the private financieras
and CFN was more than expected, the institutions had less need to issue bonds
and certificates, Furthermore, deve:Lopment bonds sold to BCE were not fore-
seen and had not been excluded from the matching formula. The formula did
explicitly exclude bonds with repurchase agreements; the exclusion would be
maintained in proposed loan and only mobilization of funds from the public
would qualify in the matching formula (para 3.16).

B.  Obectives
3.11      The proposed Fifth Loan seeks to build on the accomplishments
and experience of the four earlier loans, sharpening their focus toward the
following objectives:
(a)  in the light of actual experience following the March 1981
adiustment of interest rates, to maintain progress toward an
interest regime more flexible and responsive to market
influences;
(b)  to increase over the longer term the strength, diversity and
efficiency of the Ecuadorian capital market by encouraging
the issuance and purchase of longer term debt instruments
(specifically those of the financieras) and the creation of
an effective secondary market for such investments;
(c)  to encourage greater initiative, reach, and competition by
financieras through broader participation of the newer,
smaller, and (to some extent) dispersed ones;
(d)  to strengthen institutional capabilities for loan appraisal
and supervision, collection and organization of data,
exchange risk management, etc. through technical assistance
components; and
(e)  to analyze the existent system of industrial protection/
incentives, identify anomalies and sources of inefficiency
and provide a basis for its rationalization -- through a study
in depth of effective protection/subsidies and their cumulative
impact, whose foreign costs would be financed from the Loan.
3.12      The foregoing objectives have been discussed extensively with
the government, which expresses full concurrence with all except (a); the
monetary authorities are not yet persuaded that the advantages of a freer
interest rate regime would outweigh possible strains and risks, but they
stress that the March 1981 adjustment is an initial step and test and that
they are willing to consider further measures if and as market reaction and
international interest rate tendencies may indicate the need to do so.
C. Participating Institutions
3.13      The characteristics of CFN and of the growing number of private
financieras are summarized in paras 2.25 to 2.36, and in Annex 1, Tables 6-10.
For easy reference in this report, and with no invidious connotations, they
are classified into three groups on the basis of their prior participation
(or eligibility) in Bank loans, as follows:
Group I   - participants throughout, from the First Loan --
CFN and COFIEC



- 32 -
Group II  - additional participants eligible under the Fourth
Loan -- FINANSA, ECUFINSA, FINANSUR, FIDASA,
FINIBER and MANABI
Group III - financieras not participating in the Fourth Loan but
potentially eligible to participate in the proposed
loan -- GUAYAQUIL, AMERAFIN, ANDINA, FINEC, and
REPUBLICA
3.14      CFN and COFIEC, given their large size and long familiarity with
Bank requirements relative to other financieras, will almost certainly
use the bulk of Bank funds under the proposed loan. However, as the other
financieras have increased in number and grown in size and experience, it
is expected and intended that their percentage share in the Fifth Loan
will be substantially greater than under the Third and Fourth--when it
amounted to 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively. In order to avoid their being
preempted in the early life of the loan, 25% of the Loan amount will be
reserved for Group II and III financieras--in shares roughly proportional to
their respective capital and reserves as of June 30, 1981, but with some
weighting in favor of the smaller ones--for a period of one year from Loan
effectiveness, subject to their fulfilling the conditions of participation
specified in paras 3.15-3.16, and to the normal requirements of project and
appraisal quality. CFN and COFIEC would be in competition from the start, on
a first-come, first-served basis, for the remaining 75% of the Loan; the others
would also compete for the unallocated share once they had exhausted their
initial allotments; and all could compete for any unused allotments after
expiry of the first year. This should serve to maintain a competitive spirit
and stimulus, while providing a modest "infant financiera" protection.
Conditions of Participation
3.15      Participation in the Fourth Loan by the Group II financieras was
conditioned on the following:
(a)   paid-in capital at :Least US$2.0 million equivalent;
(b)   a portfolio contain:Lng at least five medium and long-term
operations; and
(c)   a total debt/equity ratio of no more than 7 to 1, later relaxed
to 8.5 to 1, subject to review for financieras desiring to
orient themselves more strongly toward medium- and long-term
operations. 1/
Subsequently, the condition under (b) was altered to require that participat-
ing financieras develop a program by which at least 20% of total portfolio
would consist of medium- or long-term operations by the end of 1981. While
aiming at this goal, most of the Group II financieras have continued to engage
mainly in short-term guarantee operations financed by foreign banks, which are
relatively favored by the interest structure. Under the proposed loan the
1/   A debt/equity ratio of 10 to I was agreed for the most mature Group II
financiera.



- 33 -
targets summarized above, as amended, would be maintained for Group II and III
prospects, with the target date for Group I-I to achieve a 20% share for
medium/long-term operations set at DecermDer 31, 1982. Also, for continuing
eligibility under the fifth and subsequent Bank loans, Group II and III
financieras would have to raise this share to 30% after two years from its
initial target date. COFIEC and CFN would have to maintain 50% of their
portfolios in medium- and long-term operations. No financiera would be able
to make additional commitments of Bank funds while in default on those targets.
Each financiera would sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with BCE providing for,
inter alia: (a) a total debt/equity ratio of no more than lO to 1 in accordance
with Ecuadorean banking laws; (b) provisions for loss equal to at least 1% of
its total portfolio; and (c) a limitation, equal to twice its equity, on
aggregate exposure to stockholders owning more than 1% each of the shares of
the financiera. Close supervision by the Superintendency of Banks will help
to ensure that a prudent financial structure is maintained (para 3.19).
3.16      The objectives sought by the government and the Bank with regard
to resource mobilization will require a strong inducement for the financieras
to make vigorous and imaginative efforts to tap the medium/long term market
and genuinely to test the quantum of resources potentially available and
the interest rates (or discounts) renuired to elicit a good response. Each
financiera's use of Bank funds will therefore be contingent on its mobilization
of domestic medium or long term resources in the following proportions:
Resulting
Entitlements to
Type of Domestic Resources                      Bank Funds
(a)  borrowings with maturity of over 3 years                -  0.2 times
(b)  certificates with maturity of 6 months to 3 years   -  0.4 times
(c)  bonds with maturity of over 3 years or more up to
7 years, and intermediation of shares                   -  0.8 times
(d)  incremental equity                                      -  0.5 times
(e)  bonds with maturity over 7 years or more                -  2.0 times
(f)  underwriting of shares of enterprises                   -  0.6 times
All increments to equity and amounts outstanding of bonds and certificates
(except when sold directly to public financial institutions) with maturities
of 18 months or more, made since December 31, 1981, will count in accordance
with the above scale. To encourage capi tal market development, the under-
writing of shares of enterprises would be counted in the resource mobilization
efforts of financieras. Based on past experience and outlook approximately
US$118 million could be mobilized in connection with the Fifth Project
(Table 3.2).

3.17      The project appraisal capabilities of CFN and COFIEC have developed
over several years experience, although CFN showed signs of recent deterioration
probably resulting from increased turnover and loss of staff. The Group II
financieras have performed fairly well in this regard under the Third and
Fourth Loans, although unevenly; and some, at least, are in need of improvement
in more sophisticated analysis such as ERR calculations. The Bank has little
basis so far for assessing the capabilities of Group III financieras. For the
proposed loan, in view of the increases in prices since 1979, the free limits
for CFN and COFIEC will be increased to US$ 2 million for each from the
previous US$1.5 million and US$1.25 million, respectively; and those for the
Group II financieras to US$350,000 (from US$250,000). The Group III financieras
would be required to submit the first: two projects for Bank approval and, if
the appraisals prove satisfactory, the same US$350,000 free limit would be set
for them; otherwise, they would continue to submit all projects for advance
approval until their appraisals measure up to standard. They would be encour-
aged to use the services of the Resident Advisor to be located in the Ministry
of Finance (para 3.20).



- 35 -
D. Technical Assistance Components
3.18      The Fifth Loan would include four technical assistance elements:
(a) reinforcement of the supervisory and data collection
capabilities of the Superintendency of Banks (SB);
(b) advisory services to financieras, management and staff on the
requirements, methodology and specific problems of subproject
appraisal;
(c) an in-depth study of industrial incentive measures and their
consequences; and
(d) strengthening of CFN's accounting and budgeting systems.
3.19      The SB has a generally well-designed Manual and program for super-
vision of financial institutions. It has agreed to extend or intensify its
supervision of financieras and reporting thereon, insofar as may be necessary
to meet the Bank's requirements, (Annex 2). SB has requested Bank assistance,
and modest funding from the proposed loan, for a training program to upgrade
the capabilities of their inspection staff; Bank staff are already assisting
the SB in carrying out the training program. Consultancy funds would also be
made available to SB for studies to help improve the system of data collection
and reporting and the management of foreign exchange risks (Annex 3). During
negotiations these agreements were confirmed.
3.20      The financieras are under generally competent direction but most
of their staff members have a background of conventional banking and money
market operations, rather than long-term project financing--although some have
had training and experience with CFN or COFIEC. Appraisals so far received
from the newer institutions, while creditable on the whole, are of uneven
quality; and some have not been able to make any timely submissions. As
their projects increase in size and complexity, moreover, the appraisals
are likely to become more difficult and elaborate, and to require more
refinements, such as ERR calculations. It is not feasible for the Bank to
undertake an institution building and staff training effort in relation to the
11 newer financieras comparable to that previously devoted to CFN end COFIEC;
it would greatly overburden staff resources. It has therefore been agreed
with the Ecuadorian authorities and the several financieras that a small portion
of the proposed loan will be earmarked to finance the employment by the Ministry
of Finance, of a well-qualified advisor experienced in project appraisal
methodology (and insofar as possible in other aspects of development banking),
to be resident in Quito for an initial period of two years, to carry out the
following functions:
(a) on request, usually by a financiera but occasionally also
by the Bank, to assist financiera staff in completing or
refining their analysis of subprojects, in identifying
informational gaps or methodological anomalies, etc., with
a view to improving the quality of appraisals and submissions;



- 36 -
(b)  to visit individual financieras (especially those less experi-
enced) from time to time to review with them the subprojects
they have under analysis, discuss any difficulties encountered
and advise on means of solving them, apprise them of any
superior methodologies or data sources; etc;
(c)  to help organize and conduct programs of training for new
project appraisal staff for the financieras, seminars on related
subjects of common interest, etc; and
(d)  on occasion to give similar assistance, as needed, in the
preparation of financial projections and other operational
problems.
3.21      It has been agreed that the government will carry out, with the
help of consultants, an analytical study of export promotion and other incen-
tives measures that operate in EcuaLdor, with a view to proposing reforms
conducive to better use of resources and trade strategy. The study would be
carried out by a group in MICEIT's Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CENDES) and
partially financed from funds earmaLrked under the proposed loan. Bank staff
assisted the government in preparing the terms of reference; the Bank would
assist in the design of methodology and choice of an expatriate expert to
organize and guide the development of the MICEI study. It would be supervised
by a Coordinating Committee (CC) comprising the principal Ecuadorian agencies
concerned, under the chairmanship of the Vice-Minister of Industry. Ecuadorian
consultants would undertake by far the major part of the data collection and
analysis, and be responsible for the study's conclusions and recommendations--
although the Bank would review them and comment at several stages. On com-
pletion, the government would agree with the Bank on a set of proposed actions
to be taken on the basis of the study and a timetable for carrying them out.
Definite terms of reference for the study were confirmed during negotiations
and a timetable for completion and subsequent agreement on policy actions are
included in the Loan Agreement.
3.22      It is proposed that the following amounts be earmarked, within the
Fifth Loan, for the technical assistance components summarized above:
Resident Advisor (2 years)                                 US$200,000
Superintendency of Banks Training and Studies
(3.5 person-years of foreign consultants)                  350,000
Industrial Protection/Incentives Study
(16 months of expatriate consultants'
services)                                                150,000
CFN Accounting and Budgeting Systems                          100,000
Unallocated                                                   200,000
US$1,000,000
Commitments for these purposes would be reviewed well before the closing
date, and any uncommitted balance reprogrammed for subproject financing.

IV. THE LOAN
A. Borrower and Terms
4.01      The proposed loan of US$60.0 million to the Republic of Ecuador
would be channelled through BCE, the government's fiscal agent: Part A,
US$59.0 million equivalent to eligible financieras; and Part B, US$1 million
to various government agencies to finance technical assistance. Part A funds
would be made available to industrial and related enterprises for financing
the direct foreign exchange costs of investments in physical assets and
associated permanent working capital through either loans or equity investments.
Part A of the proposed loan would be repayable within 15 years on an amortiza-
tion schedule corresponding to the composite of subloans or (for investments)
to a schedule agreed ad hoc. Part B would be repaid on a fixed amortization
schedule of 15 years. Up to US$6.0 million could be used for expenditures
on agreed subprojects or technical assistance occurring after July 31, 1981.
The terminal date for submission of subprojects would be December 31, 1984.
In the light of prior experience with similar projects the closing date for
disbursements has been established at December 31, 1986.
B. Allocation
4.02      Part A of the proposed loan would be allocated to the respective
financieras on a first-come, first-served basis, up to the maximum amount each
could commit in proportion to its mobilization of domestic resources from the
public (para 3.16). A total of USS15.0 million, however, would be reserved
for financieras other than COFIEC and CFN, in shares specified for each, for a
period of one year from effectiveness (para 3.14). The formula for matching
Bank funds to domestic resource mobilization would be reviewed with the review
of interest rates (para 4.07), and adjusted if necessary after exchanging
views with the Borrower.
C. Free Limits and ERR
4.03      The following free limits would assure Bank review of a reasonable
proportion of subprojects from each institutions and afford the Bank the
opportunity to conduct a dialogue with the financieras concerning appraisal
techniques.
Financieras                  Free Limit (US$ thousand)
CFN and COFIEC                                2,000
Other financieras (after receipt of
two satisfactory appraisals from
those in Group III)                           350
An economic rate of return (ERR) would be calculated in all subproject receiving
more than US$300,000 in Bank funds or more than US$1.0 million in other medium
and long term funds.



- 3;8 -
4.04      With a view to encouraging special attention to export-oriented
production, a sum of US$20.0 million will be reserved for projects that are
expected to export 50% or more of their incremental gross output (para 3.05).
Therefore, financieras in their subproject appraisals would clearly identify
export and non-export subprojects and would be able to commit no more than
US$39.0 million for the latter.
D. Fees, Interest Rates, and Commissions
4.05      The Government of Ecuador, through BCE, would charge a fee of 2.9%
for assuming the risk of borrowing in the currencies of the Bank's currency
pool at an assumed 11.6% p.a. and on:Lending to the financieras in Sucres at 15%
p.a. including a 0.5% p.a. administration fee for BCE. These terms would be
reflected in a Subsidiary Loan Agreemnent between BCE and each financiera, the
signing of which would be a condition of disbursement to any financiera.
4.06      Interest rates to subborrowers would be set at the nominal legal
maximum of 15% p.a. plus the commissLons of 2.5% or 3.5% p.a. (equal to the
commissions allowed for loans financed through long term bonds) depending on
the subloan's original final maturity. On this basis, the typical subloan of
7 or more years would bear an effective interest rate of 18.5% p.a. At the
inflation rate of 11.2% p.a. of 1978-80, and even at the higher rate of 15% p.a.
projected for 1981-83, the proposed interest rate to subborrowers would be
significantly positive in real terms. However, the indicated margins of 2.5-3.5%
could prove insufficient to sustain the financieras' lending activity, given the
larger spreads on other operations. 1/
4.07      Because of lack of experience with the new interest rates and
commissions, and the possibility that, notwithstanding the changes, financieras
might be unable to mobilize significant resources from the public, the Bank
and government will review, not later than December 31, 1982 or before commit-
ment of more than US$30.0 million of the loan, the situation with respect to
interest rates, spreads and other important factors bearing on long term
resource mobilization and lending. Further commitment of the loan would be
contingent on agreement between the government and the Bank that the interest
regime and other policy measures would be conducive to efficient use of the
loan and mobilization of long term resources by the financieras.
E. Subloans and Investments
4.08      The financieras would set subloan terms according to the financial
requirements of the individual subprojects, provided that the final maturity
of any subloan fall no later than 15 years from loan signing. Financieras
could also use Bank funds for investments in share capital of subprojects and
would repay these funds to the Bank within 15 years of loan signing according
to an agreed schedule. Because of the high nominal interest rate, amortization
schedules of subloans providing for gradually increasing payments of principal
plus interest would be permitted. When a subloan is partially financed by
cofinancing resources (para 4.10), the amortization schedule of the Bank
subloan could be adjusted to facilitate the shorter maturity of the cofinanced
1/   In the event that interest ratet policies are revised (para 4.07), the
above conditions will be modified accordingly.



- 39 -
loan, while providing for gradually increasing payments of principal plus
interest on the combined amortization schedules. To prevent undue concentra-
tion of Bank financing, no firm or group of related firms would be able to
borrow or receive investments of more than US$3.0 million in Proposed Loan
funds or more than US$4.0 million from the proposed and previous Bank loans.
F. Disbursement and Procurement
4.09      Procurement would follow the standard practice for previous Develop-
ment Banking Loans in Ecuador. The basic procurement decision is made by the
subborrower; individual procurement contracts seldom exceed US$250,000. The firm
typically compares several alternatives for each important item following normal
business practice. The financiera would check this procedure to ensure that
the goods and services being procured are technically adequate and reasonably
priced. Under the proposed loan the financiera would spell out in the subproject
appraisal the steps toward these ends it and the subborrower had taken. Dis-
bursements would be made for 100% of the direct foreign exchange costs of the
financieras' subloans and would be fully documented. Disbursements under the
technical assistance components would be for 100% of foreign expenditures.
Loan documentation establishs clearly the obligation of BCE when dealing
with the financieras to make all conversions between Sucres and the currencies
disbursed by the Bank at rates of exchange that fully protect the financieras
from the exchange risk on Bank funds.
G. Cofinancing
4.10      Conversations by the Bank with the financieras and international
(foreign) commercial banks (FCBs) have taken place to the end of arranging
cofinancing for the proposed loan to meet the project's need for additional
resources (para 1.23). Although the cofinancing arrangements are still un-
certain, it appears that one or more banks would be prepared to lead a
consortium to provide US$40.0 -US$50.0 million at medium term maturity and
standard LIBOR terms. Because financieras are prohibited from lending in
foreign exchange, cofinancing funds would be lent by the FCB directly to
the subborrower with a financiera's guarantee. The FCB would negotiate with
each financiera the maximum amount of cofinancing funds each could use and its
cost. Some financieras using Bank funds might not choose or be chosen to use FCB
funds. The Bank and FCB would agree to exchange information on the subprojects
and financieras. Cofinancing funds would be used only for subprojects approved
by the FCB and, unless the FCB otherwise agreed, for subprojects partially
financed by the Bank. The financiera would evaluate these subprojects as they
do others and, taking into account the assets to be financed and the financial
strength of the subborrower, make up a specific package of Bank and FCB funds.
On Bank approval of the subloan the FCB would immediately disburse its portion.
No cross default clause is contemplated as the borrowers from the Bank Loan
and the FCB are distinct. Nor would the government be asked to absorb either
the credit risk or foreign exchange risk on the FCB's portion of subproject
financing; the latter risk would remain with the subborrowers.



- 40 -
H. Project Benefits and Risks
4.11      A principal benefit anticipated from this project will be oppor-
tunities for continuing an increasingly informed dialogue with the government
on (a) means to bring about more effective mobilization of domestic resources
including interest rate policies (paras 2.37 and 4.07); and (b) industrial
policy reforms on the basis of the projected study of protection and incentives
(para 3.20 and Annex 4). It is expected that the requirement that financieras
mobilize set amounts of matching resources as a condition of access to Bank
funds will serve both as an inducement and as a test of market potential and
of the adequacy of financial policies to facilitate resource mobilization.
4.12      A further benefit of the project will stem from the participation
of a much more numerous and varied group of private financieras. This should
enhance competition, resource mobilization efforts, and access to credit for
smaller firms or those in outlying regions. The provision of advisory assistance
in project appraisal and related matters should strengthen the technical and
analytical capabilities of the newer financieras, while the proposed reinforce-
ment of the SB should improve the effectiveness of supervision and reporting
with respect to all of them. Cofinancing associated with the proposed loan
would mark the first time the financieras had obtained 8 year funds from a
commercial bank. Moreover the cofinancing technique being pioneered in the
proposed loan may find application elsewhere.
4.13      The government has taken steps to make AZTRA and Selva Alegra profit-
able and to contribute US$20.0 million to CFN according to an agreed timetable.
4.14      The economic benefits of the proposed project would be similar to
those of the four previous Bank loarLs. Approximately 60 subprojects with an
average use of Bank funds of around US$1 million each would be financed with
an average ERR of over 20% (para 3.08). Most subprojects continue to be in
the resource-based food, beverage, textile, and forest products subsectors.
Although few import substituting subprojects would have very low cost/job
levels for workers directly employed, they would create added employment
through both backward and forward linkages. Because export projects are more
labor intensive one third of loan funds are so earmarked. Based on experience
and the expected increase in the proportion of export projects, Bank funds
would be used to help finance arouncd US$240 million in total investment and
create around 8,000 jobs.
4.15      The main potential risk is that market conditions and investor
psychology may effectively preclude the financieras from mobilizing medium-
and long-term funds on the scale reqiuired to match Bank funds according to the
formula (para 3.16) or that the cost of money so mobilized may be unacceptably
high for borrowers. Such results would call for intensive consultation with
the government and the financieras, to try to devise remedial measures.

V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations agreements have been reached or confirmed on
the following--
(a)  With the government, on:
(i) a mid-loan review, jointly with the Bank of
experience under the March 1981 interest rate
regime (or subsequent adjustments) as it bears
on domestic resource mobilization, and of
whether further rate modifications or policy
changes may be needed (paras 3.09 and 4.07);
(ii)  terms of reference, administrative and funding
arrangements, and a timetable for a study of industrial
protection/incentives including provision for discussing
the results with the Bank and carrying out an agreed
upon program of reforms (para 3.21);
(iii) terms of reference for SB's supervision and
reporting responsibilities with respect to
financiera operations, and administrative
and funding arrangements for technical and
training assistance to the SB in support of
these responsibilities (paras 2.38 and 3.19,
and Annexes 2 and 3);
(vi)  fee to be charged through BCE for absorbing
the foreign exchange risk (para 4.05); and
(v) other terms and conditions of the proposed loan
(paras 4.01 to 4.09).
(b)  With the government and CFN, on:
(i) arrangements for relieving CFN of the financial
burden of AZTRA and Selva Alegre, make adequate
provisions and a timetable for transferring the
required funds (para 2.31);
(ii)  ensuring CFN's access to local and foreign sources
of financing (para 2.26);
(iii) continuing reimbursement of CFN's foreign exchange losses
and a freeze on further borrowing which exposes CFN to
substantial exchange risk (para 2.30);
(iv)  technical assistance in CFN's accounting, budgeting,
and financial information systems (para 2.29); and
(v) limitation on CFN's exposure to a single firm (para 2.31).



- 42 -
(c)  With the government and the financieras, on:
(i)  conditions for the financieras' eligibility
to participate in. the Proposed Loan (para 3.15);
(ii) the requirement for all financieras to mobilize
domestic resources in amounts proportional
to their use of Bank funds, and the formula
for matching (para 3.16);
(iii)  the temporary preallocation of part of the Loan for
Group II and Group III financieras (para 3.14),
and reservation of US$20.0 million to finance
export production projects (para 4.04); and
(iv)  terms of reference and administrative and
funding arrangements for the services of an
advisor on development banking/project appraisal
(para 3.20).
(d)   With the financieras, on:
(i) debt/equity, other financial covenants, and free
limit conditions (paras 3.15 and 3.17); and
(ii) upgrading of subproject evaluation (para 3.06).
5.02      The following would be condition of Loan effectiveness:
Signing of a Fiscal Administration Agreement, satisfactory
to the Bank, between the Borrower and BCE.
5.03      The following would be conditions of disbursement:
(a) to any financiera: signing of its Subsidiary Loan Agreement
with the Central Bank (para 4.05); and
(b)  to any financiera that has not previously participated
in Bank loans: adoption of a Policy Statement satisfactory
to the Bank (para. 2.35).
Recommendation
5.04      With the above agreements, the proposed project would constitute
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$60.0 million to the Republic
of Ecuador on the terms and conditions shown in Chapter IV.

ANNEX 2
-62 -                         Page 6 of 9 pages
are payment arrears and not merely the total of such arrears. This will make
it possible to assess the finance company's portfolio value and risk. The
percentage of short medium and long term loans can also be determined from
the information given in Attachmenet 2.  In addition, the Superintendency will
furnish a sumary analysis of the information on the total portfolio of each
finance company by geographic distribution (p.ace where the rescurces vere
used), by economic activity (activity being carried on by the enterprise using
the resources; purchases of machinery for commercial purposes will have to
be classified under "commerce"), and by purpose of the loan (fixed capital,
working capital, and personal or consumer loans).   Machinery
financed by commercial enterprises for purposes of resale will be classified
as working capital. Since the information requested relates to the current
portfolio, the Superintendency wiLL need initiallyto obtain the statement of
condition of each finance company; thereafter, it will be able to update
the statement continuously Prom the periodic reports that the Super-
intendency current-ly requests.
1.1.4     Assessment of the company's general condition
On the basis of its regular inspections, the Superintendency vill
present a summary for each finance company relative to adherence by the
company's directors and management to its "declaration of policies" (all
finance ampanies are required to maintain this policy declaration).  This
summary will also include conclusions for each company appraising its control,
administration and financial appraisal mechanisms and the suitability of its
planning, management of funds, operational strategy and organizaticn.

Terms of Reference for Preparation of the Study on
"The Evolution and Structure of Tariff Protection and-Ineentives for Manufacturing
Industry in Ecuador: Evaluation of Economic Effects in the 1970s"
1.        Background
Recent developments in the world economy, and in the Ecuadorian economy
in particular, have made it necessary to modify the treatment of the productive
sectors, including manufacturing. From some years, there has been discussion
about the need to revise and redesign incentives for that sector in order to
make it more efficient. Moreover, in view of the projected decrease in earnings
from oil exports, there is a clear need for greater efforts to orient industry
toward exports and the generation of new jobs, which in turn requires a modifica-
tion of the legal and institutional structure supporting that activity.
A number of questions have been raised about the present system of incentives:
(a) Has import substitution been encouraged more than exports?
(b) Has the production of consumer goods been encouraged more than the
production of intermediate and capital goods?
(c) Have capital-intensive subsectors and techniques been encouraged more
than labor-intensive ones?
(d) Have subsectors making intensive use of imported inputs and techniques
been encouraged more than those based on domestic inputs?
(e) Is the tax loss from these incentives high and increasing with respect
to the benefits obtained by the country?
With this background and these questions in mind, an overall analysis
of the role played in the last decade by protection and incentives for industry
will make it possible to lay down specific guidelines for the formulation



ANNEX 4
- 72 -                         Page 2 of 9 pages
of modern policies aimed at promoting the growth of the industrial sector.  In
this context, the analysis and retrospective evaluation of such policies as quanti-
tative import restrictions and legislation on industrial development, tariffs,
exchange control, etc., as well as mechanisms such as tax exemptions for imports
of raw materials, intermediate goods and capital goods, reinvestment, import
duties, advance deposits, tax credit certificates, and the like, will indicate the
level of protection received by industry and the tax loss incurred in providing
such incentives for the industrial sector.
The components of the study are listed in the preliminary outline below.
Additional discussion will be needed on the size of the sample of firms to be
surveyed and the formulas for measuring protection levels and tax revenues foregone.

Undersecretary of Industry and Tourism or his representative.
The following agencies will be represented in the committee: Ministry
of Industry, Commerce and Integration, Ministry of Finance, National Development
Council, Central Bank of Ecuador, National Finance Corporation, CENDES, and such
other agencies as the committee may consider appropriate. CENDES will hire
Ecuadorian and foreign consultants to make up the technical team for the study,
in conjunction with its own staff. The World Bank will finance the foreign
exchange costs of the study, and Ecuadorian agencies will cover local costs, as
indicated in the attached budget.
The study will be completed by December 31, 1982 and the Government
will present to the Bank the final report with its comments and the reform it
proposes to implement by March 31, 1983.
