                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


  A. SUMMARY

1.     The proposed changes to the Sub-National Governments Public Sector
Modernization Program, Loan 7352-AR, P070448 include: (a) one year extension of the
Closing Date from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013; and (b) a change in some Project
Development Objective (PDO) and intermediate indicators. This would be the second
extension for the Loan’s Closing Date and would result in a cumulative extension of
2.5years.

2.     The Project Development Objective remains unchanged and likelihood of
achieving it will increase with the proposed changes.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

3.     The US$ 40 million loan was approved in December 2005, and became effective
in June 2007, after an eighteen-month initial delay. Loan resources are on lent by the
National Government to participating Sub-national Governments through subsidiary loan
agreements. Disbursements to date amount to US$ 30.3 million out of US$ 40 million.

4.      The first restructuring of the Project took place in October 2010 and the
corresponding amendment letter became effective on January 7, 2011. This restructuring
entailed an adjustment in Project scope and disbursement arrangements, an extension of
the Closing Date by 18 months, from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012, a
contracting deadline of March 31, 2011 for signing of new contracts, and a modification
of the outcome and output indicators adjusted to reflect revised priority areas. A second
restructuring, the corresponding amendment and a waiver were processed and approved
in February 2, February 10, 2011 and March 31, 2011 respectively, to reallocate proceeds
between expenditure categories, increase the disbursement percentage to 100% and
extend the contracting period by one month to April 30, 2011 to allow the executing
agencies time to finish processing major eligible contracts.

5.      The project is currently on the right track as per the intended development
objectives -there is a total of seven participating provinces with 79 contracts covering
eight sectors of reform- and implementation is in full swing. As Table 1 shows, Project
execution has experienced a remarkable turn-around compared to previous years. The
disbursement as of February 21, 2012 is US$ 30.3 million or 76% of loan funds; and the
remaining balance is fully committed. Participating Sub-national Governments have
signed a total of approximately US$ 41.5 million in contracts (over the loan amount of
US$ 40 million) and agreed to provide counterpart funding for the contracts to
complement Bank funding.

               2011             US $ 22.4 million                  56%




  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

6.      Results/indicators. The results framework would be changed as shown in Annex
1. The reasons for the changes are twofold. Firstly, there is a need to include indicators
for new public sector management areas that, although envisioned in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD), did not include indicators. Secondly, some indicators could
not be measured and therefore they have been replaced by others that better capture the
results of the Project. The new set of indicators is intended to reflect the real impact of
this Project on public sector management which cannot be accounted for by other
external factors.

7.       Closing date. An extension of one year has been requested in order to allow time
for completion of ongoing activities and ensure a smooth implementation during the
change in administration. Most importantly, the additional implementation time would
allow for an evaluation of more measurable outputs and thus the ability to report on
results impact within the time frame of the current Project.

  D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

8.     The proposed restructuring does not trigger new risks. The changes are not
changing the scope of the Project and they are expected to yield positive results in
meeting Project targets and desired outcomes.

have increased their own tax resources; (4) Provincial governments have real-time information on public employees (including personal information, work history,
post, pay level, aggregate wage bill, etc.). Improper salary payments are stopped. The impact of proposed personnel policies can be modeled before they are enacted.
Revised Intermediate Result (Component One): 1) Cadastre management is efficient and users receive better services; (2) The administration of property registries is
more efficient and users (cadastre, citizens) receive better services; (3) Provincial governments have “on line? information on public employees (including personal
information, work history, post, pay level, aggregate wage bill, etc.). The impact of proposed personnel policies can be modeled before they are enacted.
