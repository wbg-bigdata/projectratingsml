APPRAISAL OF THE NUCLEUS ESTATES AND SMALLHOLDER V PROJECT
I. Project and Sector Background
General
1.01      Under its nucleus estates and smallholders development program,
the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank assistance to develop
about 53,000 haL of tree crops (rubber, oil palm, coconuts), food crops and
house gardens in West Java, West Kalimantan, and Bengkulu provinces
with the public sector estates PTP XI, XIII, XXIII, and PNP VII as develop-
ment agents. lThe project would immediately benefit some 19,800 smallholder
families in the first two provinces and, through estate development in the
other, set the stage for additional smallholder investments at a later time.
It would also include technical assistance to the Directorate General of
Estates (DGE) aLnd the participating PNP/PTP, and a staff training component.
1.02      GOI identified the project with Bank assistance, and it reflects the
national needs and priorities outlined in the Third Five-Year Plan (Repelita
III, April 1979 - March 1984). GOI and the Bank prepared the project, using
feasibility studies by the Marihat Research Station, PNP VII, PTP XXIII, and
several consultant firms. This report is based on material contained in the
above studies, and the findings of an appraisal mission, composed of Messrs.
M. Saddington, C. Carlier, F. Lucca (Bank), C. Relf, C. Surre, I. Cooper and
N. Azizi (Consultants), which visited Indonesia in October 1980.
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.03      Objectives.  The Government's major objectives for the agricultural
and rural sector are to: (a) create productive employment to raise the
incomes of the rural poor; (b) increase domestic food supply to keep pace
with rising demand; (c) expand agricultural exports, particularly of small-
holder tree crops; and (d) ensure productive, sustainable use of Indonesia's
land, water and other natural resources.
1.04      Near:ly 16 million smallholder families produce subsistence and cash
crops on 16 million ha, while 1,800 estates occupying 2.2 million ha produce
mainly rubber, sugar, tea, palm oil, and tobacco. Despite a 4% average annual
growth of production, agriculture's share of GDP has declined from 40% to 31%
since 1968, while its share of exports dropped from 45% to 37% due mainly to
the markedly increased value of oil exports. Nevertheless, agriculture
provides 80% of non-oil exports, and remains of overwhelming importance to the
great majority of Indonesians; nearly 80% of the population lives in rural
areas, and agriculture is the major source of income for about two-thirds of
rural households and one-tenth of urban households.



-2-
Development Strategies
1.05      Employment.  Agriculture's share of total employment decreased
from 69% in 1961 to 64% in September 1971. Nevertheless, agriculture
remained by far the largest single source (with 46%) of new employment
during 1971-76. Outside Java, employment prospects in agriculture appear
quite promising given the sustained increases in the smallholder area, due
to land and irrigation development, including that under publicly sponsored
and spontaneous transmigration. In Java, rehabilitation of irrigation
systems, which generated significant employment in the last decade, should
continue to provide additional construction and farm work.
1.06      Food Crops.  Given its limited trained manpower and earlier
limited financial resources, GOI has concentrated on increasing the
production of rice, the preferred staple food of the great majority of
Indonesians. Rice production increased rapidly (4.5% p.a.) between 1968 and
1974, due chiefly to irrigation rehabilitation and the provision to
irrigated rice growers of fertilizer and highyielding variety seed, financed
largely through the BIMAS credit program. The growth rate slowed markedly to
1.7% p.a. over 1974-77, in the wake of severe declines in fertilizer usage
(due to restrictions on private sector fertilizer trade), successive seasons
of untimely rainfall, and serious attacks by pests and diseases. In 1978,
rice production increased by 10% over in the preceding year with better
weather, improved and liberalized fertilizer distribution, and nationwide
Government distribution of recently introduced pest resistant varieties.
Preliminary estimates for 1980 suggest a 14% increase over 1978 due to good
rainfall, more fertilizer, and more pest resistant varieties. Over the past
decade, output of secondary food crops (maize, cassava, soybeans, peanuts, and
sweet potatoes) grew more slowly, at an average of only 1.6% p.a., composed of
a 1.1% p.a. average decline in area (much of this land shifting to irrigated
rice) and a 2.7% p.a. increase in yield.
1.07      These gains in food output did not keep pace with the 3.5-4.0% p.a.
increase in demand due to rising population and incomes. Indonesia became
the worlds largest rice importer, with a record import of 2.3 million tons
in 1977, and about 1.3 million tons in 1978. Simultaneously, wheat imports
rose to 1.4 million tons in 1978, cassava exports nearly disappeared, and
soybean, maize, and coconut oil imports began to grow. The "Indonesia
Supply Prospects for Major Food Crops" (Report No. 2374-IND of March 3,
1979) concluded that even with expanded irrigation, and improved technology,
extension, credit and marketing, food production growth would not exceed
3.5% p.a., leaving a basic food deficit up to at least 1990, with a rice
deficit alone of 2-3 million tons.
it0o&     To reduce rice imports and prevent a widening of the food
produv ion-consumption gap, productivity and area of both rice and secondary
foodt. cro-ps must be increased.  In Java, rice-cropping intensity could be
ra  se rough water storage and by exploiting groundwater.  Rice yields and
ii,ltensity can also be increased by constructing tertiary irrigation



-3-
and drainage systems, and improving support services. In the Other Islands
also there is considerable potential for new irrigation systems, including
tidal and swamp land development. Despite the scarcity of high-yielding
tropical varieties of secondary food crops, yields of existing varieties
could be increased by improved husbandry and technology. GOI is giving
increasing attention to marketing, credit, seeds and research for varietal
improvement of secondary crops. The Bank plans to assist these efforts.
1.09      Tree Crops.  Tree crops occupy about a third of total cropped land
(coconuts and rubber account for 80% of this), and generate about 43% of
total non-oil export revenue. Smallholders cultivate 80% of the rubber and
virtually all coconuts, coffee, cloves and pepper, whereas tea and oil palm
are grown primar:ily on estates. Despite recent higher world prices for
Indonesia's major tree crop products, only oil palm has shown sustained large
increases in production, due to investment programs by Government and private
estates. With the long immaturity of tree crops, static production levels
are a symptom of past low prices and neglect, especially inadequate research
and extension, anLd failure to replant with higher-yielding varieties.
1.10      Smallholder Development.  Efforts to revitalize the smallholder
tree crop sector are commencing on several fronts. One new approach, which
is being supported by four Bank-financed Nucleus Estates and Smallholders
(NES) projects, is for Government estates to plant and maintain tree crops
on previously undeveloped land until the trees reach maturity, using farmers
selected to be settlers (local landless and transmigrants) as employees, and
thereafter to provide the settlers with inputs, extension services, and
processing facilities. Tree crops are also being included in transmigration
projects. While the NES approach has been mainly for new settlers, GOI has
also initiated national programs, backed with credit support, to assist
geographically concentrated groups of existing smallholders to plant rubber
or coconuts themselves, with fairly intensive support from Project
Management Units (PMUs). This is the approach of both the Smallholder
Rubber Development Project (SRDP, Credit 984-IND) and the Smallholder
Coconut Development Project (SCDP, Loan 1898-IND). Efforts are also afoot
to design a lower-cost system of tree crop planting with minimal demands on
management. Usinlg all suitable approaches, a rapid expansion of smallholder
tree crops is a high priority, given the vast area of overaged and
low-yielding smallholder rubber and coconuts, the good market prospects,
and the Other Islands land availability and natural comparative advantage.
As these programs will place a heavy demand on technical and managerial
personnel, major staff recruitment and training efforts will be required.
l.ll      Area Development and Transmigration.  In 1978, about 86 million
people lived in Java, at a density approaching 650/sq km. This island, with
7% of Indonesia-s land area, has 45% of the cropped area and 63% of the
population. Java generally has higher fertility and better infrastructure
than the Other Islands; however, its cultivable land is almost fully utilized,
and in some higher watersheds, cultivation already exceeds ecologically safe
limits, causing erosion, flooding, and siltation of ports, dams, and



- 4 -
irrigation canals. GOI is preparing watershed development and integrated
development projects to address this problem. In addition, rural
development programs designed to meet basic needs and to generate employment
and production have been developed for certain poor areas of Java.
1.12      In the Other Islands, population density is generally low, and
undeveloped land is available. The primary program for their development
and creating employment and settlement nuclei for Javanese migrants, is
transmigration. An organized transmigration program is important for
regional and natural resource development in the Other Islands, production
of food and export crops, and creation of employment and improved living
conditions for the landless. Unfortunately, this program has long been
hampered by unrealistic expectations of its potential for resolving Java's
population problems and for stimulating large-scale regional development, by
overly ambitious targets, and by weak, uncoordinated implementation.
Confronted by management problems, GOI reorganized the program in Repelita
III, by transferring implementation responsibility from the Directorate
General of Transmigration (DGT) to the line agencies responsible for each
sector. This measure needs to be complemented by continued attention to
technical and policy issues including: (a) the suitability of the land for
food crops; (b) the role of tree crops and livestock; (c) appropriate target
incomes and farm sizes; (d) the extent of Government financial, marketing
and other services to settlers; and (e) the role of spontaneous migration.
The Second Transmigration Project (Loan 1707-IND and Credit 919-IND)
addresses these issues.
1.13      Role of Government.  While the private sector should be encouraged
to expand its role in agricultural input supply, marketing, and processing,
Government bears the major responsibility for infrastructure, resource con-
servation, and other services. Despite marked improvements over the past
decade, overly centralized procedures, weak regional planning, and tech-
nical and managerial manpower constraints have impeded agricultural and
rural development planning and implementation. GOI's concern for area
development has also increased the need to strengthen provincial and local
planning capabilities. Future programs responsive to GOI-s stated objectives
will necessarily be complex, requiring closely coordinated programs of agri-
cultural research, extension, input supply, credit, land development, trans-
port, pricing policies and marketing. GOI must therefore continue to
strengthen its key rural development institutions, particularly through the
education, recruitment, training and retention of technical manpower.
1.14      Bank Lending Strategy.  GOI and the Bank generally agree on over-
all objectives and strategies for the rural sector. While views sometimes
differ on the relative emphasis to be given to different investments, and
on the technical design of some projects, such differences are not impeding
Bank Group operations generally and are usually resolved by further analysis
and dialogue.

1.15       Projects.  Since the first of 15 irrigation projects was approved in
1968, the Bank Group's agricultural lending has rapidly expanded to include
estate and smaLlholder tree crops, fertilizer production and distribution,
sugar, livestock, fisheries, research, extension, training, seeds, trans-
migration, integrated rural development, and resource survey and mapping.  The
Operations Evaluation Department's Sector Operations Review of Bank Group
agricultural lending in Indonesia (Report No. 2166, dated August 9, 1978)
concluded that despite deficiencies in some projects, the Bank's portfolio in
Indonesian agriculture was "of overall good quality and likely to contribute
substantially to increased production." Within the context of GOI s
agricultural strategy, future Bank lending is expected to focus on:
(a)  a diversified irrigation, flood protection, drainage and swamp
reclamation program to intensify rice cropping on Java and to
improve water management and resource use in the Other Islands;
(b)  agricultural support services, including second phase projects
for agricultural research, extension, seeds, and fertilizer
distribution;
(c)  small-holder tree crop planting programs; and
(d)  area development projects aimed at (i) watershed management to
conserve soil and ensure long-term productivity in the densely
popul-ated areas of Java, (ii) integrated rural development of
poor areas on Java, and (iii) transmigration.
1.16       Sector Work.  These projects have been and would continue to be
complemented by sector work. Analyses of employment and income distribution,
irrigation, agricultural support services, and food crop production have
improved the Bank's understanding of the sector's needs and of GOI's policies.
Already underway are a study of the edible oils market in Indonesia and
reviews of the rubber subsector, the transmigration program, secondary food
crops, and the supply and requirements of technical and managerial manpower
for agriculture.
Rubber, Palm Oil and Coconut Subsectors
1.17       Rubber Subsector.  Indonesia is the world's second largest producer
of natural rubber (after Malaysia) with a 1977/78 production of about 800,000
tons and exports of 770,000 tons. Rubber comprised 6% of Indonesia's total
agricultural GDP, 7% of export earnings and 16% of non-oil exports in 1977,

1.18      Smallholder production accounts for about two-thizds of total out-
put and is concentrated on Sumatera (70%) and Kalimantan (19%).  Holdings
average about 1.5 ha, and yields 300 kg/ha. This low level of production
is explained partly by a temporary reduction in tapping intensity due to
low prices, and partly by the advanced age of plantingL, with an estimated
75% being older than 30 years. In the absence of major planting programs,
the declining trend in smallholder production would continue.
1.19      There is a well-established estate rubber sector of 455,000 ha
consisting of Government estates (200,000 ha), private national estates
(182,000 ha), and private foreign estates (73,000 ha). Total estate pro-
duction in 1977 was 250,000 tons (65% from Sumatra, 30% from Java and 5%
from Kalimantan). Despite a decline in the Government estates rubber area
from 225,000 ha in 1970 to about 200,000 ha in 1977, production increased
from 118,000 tons to 145,000 tons, and yields from 525 kg/ha to 725 kg/ha
due to improved management and replanting with high-yielding clones.
Private foreign estate companies, whose area remained virtually constant,
increased production in the same period from 40,000 tons to about 55,000 tons
and yields from 540 kg/ha to 750 kg/ha. The private national estates on the
other hand, with production of 52,000 tons, have yields as low (285 kg/ha) and
static as those of smallholders. If present trends continue, the total estate
rubber area will decline to 315,000 ha by 1990, but production will increase



-7-
to 340,000 tons. The Government estates and private foreign estates can
expect continuecl high production from existing trees, as 65% and 60% of these,
respectively, were planted in the past 15 years; for private national estates
the figure is onily 27%.
1.20      Future Rubber Prospects.  The forecast of a substantial decrease
in future rubber production has stimulated the GOI to expand rubber replant-
ing and new rubber planting programs which focus on smallholder development,
and are aimed al' raising existing holdings' productivity, and assisting poor
and landless families to clear and plant new rubber. In 1978 GOI initiated
a large scale program for smallholder rubber replanting which a new national
Rubber Replanting Unit, in the DGE, would implement. Annual targets were
10,000 ha in 1978/79; 30,000 ha in 1979/80, and about 50,000 ha thereafter
to complete 300,000 ha by 1984/85. However, because of the organizational
and administrative constraints facing the program, a more realistic goal for
the seven-year period would be 150-180,000 ha.  The SRDP project would
assist the replanting of 38,500 ha. GOI has also proposed an enlarged
nucleus estate smallholder development program, in particular the settlement
of 75,000 transmigrant families on 150,000 ha of rubber or oil palm
smallholdings during Repelita III.
1.21       Palm O)il Subsector.  Producing 568,000 tons of palm oil and
115,600 tons of palm kernels in 1979, Indonesia is the world½s second
largest palm oil producer after Malaysia.  Palm oil is Indonesia's fourth
largest agricultural export commodity after timber, rubber and coffee, and
comprises 2% of total agricultural GDP and 7% of all non-oil export
earnings.  Although Indonesia commenced commercial production of palm oil in
1926, production grew slowly until 1969.  Then, following a shift of the
world fat and o:;l consumption away from animal fats to vegetable oils, world
market prices rose considerably. In response, from 1969 to 1979, total
Indonesian oil palm area increased from 119,000 ha to 232,000 ha, an average
increase of 7% p.a. Over the same period palm oil production grew from
188,000 to 568,000 tons, an average increase of 11.5% p.a. Table 1.2 shows
Indonesian oil palm production data from 1969 to 1979.

1.22      Public sector estates account for about 70% of both the the total
area and production, and private estates for most of the remainder (Table
1.2). Smallholders own only about 1,000 ha, or less than 1%, of the mature
oil palm stands, mainly because they are unable to process palm oil, and have
no access to planting material or the technical expertise for fruit
collection or processing. By 1985 the recently negotiated NES IV project
(Loan 1835-IND) would increase smallholders planted oil palm area by 8,000
ha.
1.23      Future Palm Oil Prospects.  Faced with a growing domestic demand for
fats and oils and a concurrent declining domestic coconut oil production, GOI
is committed to rapidly expanding palm oil production to offset imports of
coconut oil, while also maintaining palm oil exports. In 1978 GOI diverted
about 100,000 tons and in 1979 about 300,000 tons of palm oil from the export
market to domestic consumption, and all palm kernel oil production was
marketed locally. Consequently the percentage of palm oil production exported
fell from 85% in 1977 to 40% in 1979. Considering the planned oil palm



- 9 -
plantings, total palm oil and palm kernel oil production could grow at 9%
annually from 1979 to 1990, and reach 1.8 million tons by 1990. Over the same
period, domestic consumption should average about 50% of production.
1.24      Coconut Subsector.  The Indonesian coconut industry, second
only to the Philippines, is dominated by smallholders. Coconuts are
produced mainly cls a sole crop in the Other Islands and in conjunction with
other crops in Java. In 1977 an estimated 2.4 million ha (including 0.6
million ha of immature trees) was under coconuts, and production was 1.5
million tons copra equivalent (CE)./l The overall average yield is
0.8 tons/ha. Sulawesi, with 21% of the coconut area, accounted for 30% of
output, while Java, with 31% of area produced 24%. Sumatra was third with
26% of area and 22% of production. Average provincial yields ranged from 1.4
tons CE per ha in Central Sulawesi and Maluku to 0.5 tons CE in Irian Jaya
and West Java.
1.25      The large local demand for coconut products is mainly for cooking
oil or fresh consumption. Although Indonesian exports accounted for about
16% of world copra and coconut oil exports in the late 1960s, current
production is inadequate to meet domestic consumption. Since 1977 the
country had to import coconut oil and/or substitute other oils to meet the
rising demand.  The 1978 shortfall of coconut oil is estimated at 360,000
tons CE, and this is forecast to rise to about 700,000 tons CE (1 kg copra =
0.62 kg coconut oil) by 1985.
1.26      There were several constraints to the growth of the coconut
subsector. Although Indonesia has good genetic coconut stock, it is only
recently that improved planting material has been developed. Poor crop
management and the absence of a credit/grant package for inputs, particularly
fertilizers, depressed yields. Smallholder replanting is usually makeshift,
in the shade of existing trees (underplanting), prolonging immature period and
decreasing yields. Copra processing at farm level is generally poor resulting
in low quality, case-hardened /2 or inadequately sundried copra with a high
moisture content of 15% or more, necessitating further drying by middlemen
and/or oil millers. Marketing is mainly organized by private sector merchants
who also act as financiers. Apparently marketing functions satisfactorily in
that smallholders can sell copra, even in remote areas, but there is little
quality control and the pricing system offers little incentives for improved
quality.
/1 These yields and production are expressed in terms of a CE of 15% mois-
ture content, the copra quality normally sold at farm level. Copra
internationally traded, usually has a moisture content of about 5-6%.
/2  Rapid kiln drying (using coconut husks as fuel) causes an outer dried
casing with the inner copra inadequaely cured.

1.27      Future Coconut Prospects.  During Repelita III the Government plans
to assist the planting/replanting of some 310,000 ha of coconuts, 83,000 ha
with hybrid /1 varieties, and the balance with local tall varieties, and to
rehabilitate 75,000 ha. Plans for the next 15 years are to plant/replant more
than a million ha, with high yielding material, and rehabilitate a similar
area. As public sector estates have had little involvement in coconut
development, GOI's present strategy is to concentrate on increasing
smallholder production, and to assist processing and agroindustrial
development. The SCDP project as a start will plant/replant or develop some
41,200 ha of coconuts, and rehabilitate another 38,000 ha.
1.28      Bank Group Lending in the Subsectors.  In the rubber, oil palm and
coconut subsectors, the Bank Group has assisted GOI with 11 projects. These
include three Agricultural Estates projects (Credits 155, 194 and 319-IND);
four NES projects (Loans 1499, 1604, 1751 and 1835-IND); three Smallholder
projects (Credits 358, 984 and Loan 1898-IND) and one Transmigration and Rural
Development project (Loan 1318-IND). The earlier Agricultural Estate projects
assist only public sector estates, while the later Transmigration and NES
projects are primarily for smallholders. In total, all these projects would
plant, replant, grow from immaturity to maturity, or rehabilitate some 256,000
ha of rubber, 133,000 ha of oil palm, and 83,000 ha of coconuts. Out of this,
the smallholders would eventually operate some 45% of the rubber, 8% of the
oil palm, and 95% of the coconut areas. While most of these projects had slow
start-ups and other initial problems, their implementation is now generally
satisfactory. The Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) has
conducted performance audits of the first two Agricultural Estate projects
(Credits 155 and 194-IND), which were recently completed. The OED reports,
while rating both the projects physically and financially successful, raised
an equity issue whether estate labor's real wages had increased during the
project, and the under-estimation of processing facility costs by the
appraisal missions. During recent years estate labor costs have increased
considerably, for example, in West Java they have increased at a faster
rate than inflation, going from Rp 200/day in 1972 to Rp 1,000/day in 1980.
Labor costs include wages (Rp 750/day in 1980), and housing, medical and
educational services (Rp 270/day). These benefits (wages plus services)
compare favorably with the current daily wage (Rp 550/day) paid casual labor
in rice production, the major agricultural crop in Java. To obtain better
estimates of processing facility costs for this project, the appraisal
mission included two commodity processing engineers, one for rubber, and the
other for oil palm and copra. The project would also provide consultant
assistance to GOI for the design, tendering, and supervision of construction
of these facilities.
1.29      The NES Projects.  Recognizing the scarce technical and managerial
expertise available within GOI to implement rural development projects, GOI
has increasingly sought to use the untapped manpower and financial resources
of the public sector estates to promote and guide smallholder development. In
/1  Proven hybrid crosses between dwarf and tall varieties are precocious
and high yielding under good management conditions.



1976 GOI initiated a tree crop development program using the public sector
estates to develop unutilized land for new smallholder settlement, and
subsequently increase tree crops production for the local and export markets.
The Bank, since November 1977, has helped finance four nucleus estates and
smallholders projects. When fully developed, these projects would
settle/resettle some 29,000 smallholder families, developing for them about
62,000 ha of rubber, 8,000 ha of oil palm, and associated food crop and house
garden areas. F'or the nucleus estates, it would develop about 39,000 ha of
rubber, 10,000 ha of oil palm and 5,000 ha of coconuts.
1.30      The first three NES projects are sufficiently advanced to assess
their effectiveness. Initially, delays in budget preparation and receipt of
funds by the nucleus estates, slowed implementation. To resolve this, GOI
has simplified financial procedures with automatic quarterly releases of
funds to the nucleus estates. Smallholder and estate plantings are now on
schedule, with t'he planting or rehabilitation of about 44,000 ha of rubber,
9,700 ha of oil palm and 3,200 ha of coconuts (Table 1.3). Field develop-
ment is good, with total plantings for NES I, II, III, and IV already 46%
completed. The construction of smallholder infrastructure, however, has
been less satisf'actory and the movement of smallholders to the project areas
is behind schedule. At certain locations this causes labor shortages for
further project construction and maintenance of tree crop plantings. When
building roads, water supplies, village facilities and settler housing, the
central and provincial governments and nucleus estates need to carefully
plan and coordinate their inputs. To facilitate this, NES III and IV
initiated several changes in project design and organization. The nucleus
estates now have greater autonomy in designing and implementing the
smallholder components. The DGE has established a special team. (Team
Khusus) to assist the nucleus estates, particularly with coordinating
agencies engaged in project works. NES IV contains funds to commence
preparatory works for the West Java component of NES V. These cover key
start-up activities such as nursery establishment, access roads, and laborer
housing. While all these activities have considerably helped project
implementation, the Team Khusus still needs strengthening to expand and
upgrade its project formulation, design and supervision activities. It
should give more attention to timely disbursing of project funds and
ensuring technical assistance to estates for village design and project
layout, and the planning and construction of processing facilities. Despite
these problems, the DGE has made considerable progress in its ability to
prepare and implement NES projects. It played a large role in preparing the
difficult (involving land redistribution) West Java component of this
project; progress with tree crop plantings are now excellent; and disburse-
ments, which at end-1980 were 11% of total funds allocated to the four
projects, are estimated to be 18% of total loans by mid-1981.
Project Formulation
1.31      By using public sector estates to transfer technology to small-
holders and settle them on predominantly tree crop holdings, this project
meets the GOI's desire for using the manpower and financial resources of the



- 12 -
public sector estates to promote smallholder development. It would meet the
GOI's major development objectives as outlined in Para. 1.03.
1.32      The project would continue GOI's settlement of smallholders, and
prepare DGE and the public sector estates to play a larger role in GOI's
future smallholder development. Not only would the proposed tree crop
plantings in West Java and West Kalimantan increase the intensity of land
use and farmer productivity but would also stop the eroding and degrading of
land in West Java. The project also would assist the DGE to considerably
expand its future nucleus estates and smallholder operations, and assume
larger responsibilities in identifying, formulating, preparing, appraising
and supervising future projects. To expand the number of estates partici-
pating in the NES operations, the project would prepare three estates, (PTP
XI, XIII and PNP VII) for smallholder development; and upgrade one other
(PTP XXIII) so it could participate in future smallholder development. The
project has an important training element which would help expand the
Estates Training Institute (LPP) and establish subcenters of the LPP for
training field staff. This institution would help supply the urgently
needed management and field staff for the agencies involved in tree crop
development. Additional trained staff are a prerequisite to any expansion
of smallholder tree crop development. The project would provide technical
assistance to improve the DGE's management, and strengthen and expand the
Team Khusus.
1.33      To help eliminate delays in constructing smallholder infra-
structure, the project would provide technical assistance for village
planning and project layout to the Team Khusus, PTP XI, XIII, and PNP VII.
Each estate would have a section, assisted by consultants, to plan the
layout of tree and food crops, and the siting and-design of village
facilities and settler housing. The Team Khusus, with internationally
recruited consultant assistance, would oversee, direct and coordinate this
work.
1.34      Using start-up funds NES IV provided, PTPs XI and XIII have already
undertaken preparatory works. While Bank staff expect the estates would
complete all the proposed works during 1981, they have so far established
rubber nurserys at Bantar Jaya, Ciemas and Sanghyang Damar, an oil palm
nursery at South Banten, and coconut nursery at Cimerak; constructed some
laborer and smallholder houses at South Banten, and done some minor road and
bridge work. These activities would help ensure NES V's early
implementation. The proposed project also contains funds for preparatory
works for future NES projects.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project is located in three provinces, West Java, West
Kalimantan, and Bengkulu. The West Java component has five sites, three of
which are situated about 130 km south-west of Jakarta near Pandeglang
township, in the districts (kabupatens) of Pandeglang and Lebak. They are
Sanghyang Damar (gross area 5,600 ha) and South Banten (20,300 ha), adjacent
to each other and PTP XI's Sanghyang Damer rubber estate; and Bantar Jaya
(4,400 ha), near PTP XI's Bantar Jaya coconut estate. The fourth site, Ciemas
(6,700 ha), is about 140 km due south of Jakarta, near the south-western shore
of Pelabuhan Ratu gulf and Pelabuhan Ratu town, in kabupaten Sukabumi. PTP XI
has a coconut estate adjacent to the proposed Ciemas smallholder area. The
remaining site, Cimerak (5,500 ha), is some 260-km south-east from Jakarta on
the southern Java coast near Pangandaran township, in kabupaten Ciamis.
2.02      At South Banten and Cimerak, the gross area would be developed for
nucleus estates and smallholders. The South Banten site would be divided
5,600 ha for the nucleus estate and 14,700 ha for the smallholders, while at
Cimerak the nucleus estate would have 900 ha and the smallholders 4,600 ha.
The remaining three sites are entirely for smallholder development.
2.03      The West Kalimantan site is some 180 km by road to the north-east
of Pontianak, the provincial capital. Its gross area is 30,000 ha, and is
in two portions, both adjacent to Ngabang township in kabupaten Pontianak.
The project would establish smallholders and a nucleus estate at Ngabang.
The Bengkulu site (gross area 6,300 ha) lies about 40 km south of the Seluma
subdistrict (kecamatan) of kabupaten South Bengkulu. It is bounded to the
west by the Bengkulu-Manna main road, to the south by the Air Sindur river,
to the east by a protected forest, and to the north by the Pekan Sabtu road.
Climate
2.04      The climate at all sites is wet tropical, with generally short or
no dry season. Mean annual rainfall varies from 2,810 mm at Bantar Jaya to
4,160 mm at Sanghyang Damar. Table 2.1 shows the mean annual rainfall at
the various sites. In West Java the dry season is normally between May and
September, however the monthly averages at the sites are generally above 100
mm for the driest month. Nevertheless extended dry periods (below 60
mm/month) of four to five months do occur about once every five years. The
sites in Bengkulu and West Kalimantan have no pronounced dry season, and
only occasionally a month below 150 mm. Table 2.1 also gives the water
deficits for oil palm in South Banten, and the estimates of future project
yields have taken account of these. The amount and annual distribution of
rainfall are suitable for the selected crops (either rubber, oil palm,
coconuts, or food crops) at the different sites. Ngabang does not have a
water deficit for oil palm. Temperatures are relatively high and uniform
year round, and do not limit crop growth. Average monthly maximum
temperatures vary from 290C to 310c, and minimum from 210C to 220C.

Topography and Soils
2.05      The West Java sites, situated in the more mountainous part of the
province, are generally undulating to hilly, and lie at 10 to 500 m above sea
level. They are criss-crossed by numerous small streams and rivers. Cimerak,
a narrow strip of land running north-south from the southern Java coast
inland, is the flatest with about 70% undulating land, while Bantar Jaya and
Ciemas are the steepest with 25% or more above 40% slope. The sites
topography generally is not suitable for food cropping, which should be
restricted to small plots along streams or in the valleys. They are suitable
to moderately suitable for treecrops, although up to 30% of some sites would
have to be left unplanted. The soils are a mixture of red yellow podzolics,
brown to reddish latosols and regosols. The project file contains detailed
soil descriptions. Generally they are acidic and low in nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium. However, with the correct fertilizer inputs they have good
potential for tree and food crops.
2.06      The Ngabang site is gently undulating to hilly in the south-western
and north-eastern zones. Numerous small streams dissect it, and the low areas
and valleys, particularly adjacent to the Landak river, are often flooded or
swampy. Its topograhy is suitable for tree crops while some of the small
valley have good potential for bunded (sawah) rice production. The soils
are mainly red-yellow podzols with some hydromorphic soils in the lower
areas and on river banks. Some white-yellow sandy soils near Ngabang would
be discarded from the project. Soils generally are low in nitrogen,
phosphorus and mnagnesium, however with the correct fertilizer inputs they
are suitable for oil palm and food crops.
2.07      The Seluma site lies in the narrow area between the western
Sumatra coast and the Barisan mountain range. It is undulating (3-15%
slopes) to hilly (average slope 30%) in the east, with 50% of the site above
20% slope. The soils are red yellow podzolic and latosols. Although highly
erodible these soils are suitable for rubber.
Land Use, Population, Farm Size and Tenure

Sawah refers to areas bunded for water control, and used principally for
rice growing. These are usually the lowest, flattest land and benefit from
water run-off from the higher areas. Sawahs may be partially or fully
irrigated, however, this sawah is rainfed. Upland refers to areas on which
farmers grow rainfed crops such as rainfed rice, corn, cassava, sweet
potatoes, soybeans or peanuts. These areas are usually sloping, and are
cropped only once every two or three years. The kebun refers to areas
farmers plant, in an irregular manner, to tree crops for mainly cash sale.
Trees planted include rubber, coconuts, cloves, bamboo, various fruit trees
and timber species. The grassland is covered by a coarse grass (Imperata
cylindrica) known as alang alang, which quickly takes over areas left fallow.
Belukar is scrubby growth on steep or other areas which farmers have thinned
or cleared for timber or cropping, but then left unused or uncropped for at
least five years.
2.09      According to the provincial government's census, 14,150 farm
families live in the West Java project areas. This is about 150 less
families than can be accommodated under the proposed farm sizes for the
project. If necessary, the West Java Government through its Provincial
Coordinating Committee (PCC) would select additional farmers for the
project from adjacent subdistricts. Of the 42,500 ha gross project area,
total gross farm holdings are an estimated 32,600 ha; 3,400 are uncultivated
and 6,500 ha is for nucleus estate development.

2.10      Farmers (Tanah Milik title) or the provincial government (Tanah
Negara title) own the land at the sites.  The village chiefs (lurahs) have
discretionary control over the government land and can grant individual
farmers the right to cultivate it. The government, however, can withdraw
this right to cultivate at any time, and thus can direct, if neceessary, that
farmers release this land for the project. The individual farmers or land
owners, however, must give their consent to Tanah Milik titled land entering
the project. Land title at the project sites is either all Tanah Negara, as
at South Banten, or a mixture of Tanah Milik and Tanah Negara. At some
sites lurahs have given the rights to cultivate all the Tanah Negara to
their villagers,, while at two sites, Bantar Jaya and Ciemas, some of the
Tanah Negara is still uncultivated. In some cases farmers have squatted and
cultivated the Tanah Negara. The data presented on number of farm families
includes these squatters. Some farmers cultivate both government and
private land.  The following table gives the area of Tanah Milik and Tanah
Negara at each site for smallholder development.

The provincial government has allocated a mixture of old forestry and private
estate concessions at South Banten (5,600 ha) and Cimerak (900 ha) for
nucleus estate development. The private estate leases have expired, and the
government has transferred these and the forestry lease to PTPs XI and XIII.
The Governor has alienated all the areas proposed for development, and local
and provincial officials. have solved all disputes concerning Tanah Milik
land entering the project.
2.11      West Kalimantan.  Scrubby regrowth predominantly covers the Ngabang
site, with small areas of upland crops on the sloping land; some limited
sawah in the small, swampy valleys between some of the higher ridges; and
areas of wild rubber. Some timber (15-25 cm in diameter) is growing on the
ridge tops. Present land use within the 30,000 ha is approximately 50-100
ha swamp sawah, 500 ha upland, 1,000 ha wild rubber and 28,400 ha scrub,
swamp, ridge and river areas. The scrubby regrowth is small diameter trees
and brush of little value which are growing on areas previously cleared for
shifting cultivation and rubber growing. On the upland crop areas farmers
usually intercrop a wide variety of rainfed crops. Wild rubber refers to
rubber trees which farmers have planted in their upland food crop areas,
given minimal or no maintenance while the seedlings mature into bearing
trees, and then, depending on current farm gate latex prices, tap the robust
and higher producing trees.
2.12      An estimated 500 families live in the Ngabang project area.  These
local people are Dyaks, the earliest known inhabitants of Kalimantan. They
are shifting cultivators, and consider that under customary (adat) law, they
have the right to the land they cultivate. They work in extended family
groups and generally they grow food crops during the wet season, and tap
rubber during the dry season. Each family has several cropping sites spread
around the village, which the family or group would cultivate about once
every ten years. The family may also have some swamp sawah sites, which
they crop about once every two or three years. They plant rubber seedlings
amongst their upland crops, and tap those seedlings which survive and are
the healthiest. Each family has about 20 ha around which they rotate their
cropping activities. A few families have certificates which the head of the
subdistrict (camat) has issued giving them the right to cultivate the land.
The majority however cultivate their land under adat law. These 500
families would be eligible to join the project, and they have already
signed their land rights over to the project. The West Kalimantan Governor
has already alienated the area for the project.
2.13      Bengkulu.  The Seluma site consists mainly of alang alang, light
bush and scrub, and secondary dryland forest. Present land use of the
6,300 ha is approximately 1,500 ha alang alang, 2,300 ha light bush and
scrub, and 2,500 ha secondary dryland forest. The site is all provincial
government land, and the Governor already has alienated it for a nucleus
estate under this project. About 180 shifting cultivator families are in the
area. PTP XXIII would hire a member of each of these families to work on the
proposed estate, and the families would also be eligible to join the future
smallholder project.

Existing Infrastructure and Services in Smallholder Areas
2.14      Existing Infrastructure.  Except for portions of Bantar Jaya, all
the West Java sites have reasonable access roads to the surrounding area,
the kabupaten main towns, and from there to Jakarta, the closest major port.
At these sites, project works could commence without any major road works.
However, for vetiicle access to two portions (650 ha) of Bantar Jaya, a
bridge is required over the Ciberang (45 m) river. Access to the Ciemas site
is by a PTP XI estate road. Under the project the kabupaten public works
would take over and maintain this road. Within the five project areas,
however, few roads exist, and tranport links are poor. Additionally,
several bridges and kabupaten roads would need upgrading to transport
increased crop production to processing facilities, and the final products
to Jakarta.
2.15      Several existing estates are adjacent or near the proposed sites.
PTP XI has an eKisting rubber estate (Sanghyang Damar Estate, rehabilitated
under Loan 1499--IND) adjacent to both the proposed Sanghyang Damar and South
Banten sites. It would serve as the nucleus estate for the Sanghyang Damar
smallholder rubber development, and would provide some processing facilities
for the smallholders (para. 3.13). PTP XI also has old rubber estates next
to the proposed Bantar Jaya and Ciemas smallholder sites. Under Loan
1499-IND, PTP XI is converting both of these estates to coconuts, and they
would each be the nucleus estate for the proposed smallholder coconut
development. Conversion work is on schedule at both of these sites. PTP
XIIIs nearest existing estate to the Cimerak site is at Pangandaran, 30 km
distance. Under the project PTP XI would establish an oil palm nucleus
estate at South Banten, and PTP XIII a coconut nucleus estate at Cimerak.
2.16      In West Kalimantan a bitumen road (180 km) connects the Ngabang
site with Pontianak. During the First Five Year Plan (Repelita I, 1969-74),
GOI rehabilitated and upgraded this road to a three and a half ton axle load
standard, and it is in good condition. The Kapuas river is another
potentially important transport artery to the project site. It is the
largest river in West Kalimantan, and carries considerable commercial
traffic to and from the provinces interior. Tayan is the loading point
nearest (about 70 km) to the project site. Australian bilateral aid
recently rehabi:Litated the road from Tayan to Sosok (gravel surface, bridges
10 ton axle load), and the road Sosok to Ngabang, which they would
bitumenize in the future.  From Ngabang to Tayan is 90 km, and from Tayan to
Pontianak by river 130 km. Year round, vessels of about 500 tons can
navigate the Kapuas to Tayan, and during the wet season, barges of about
1,000 tons can go upstream to Sanggau. Because of the low axle load design
of the Ngabang-Pontianak road, and the considerable volume of production
expected from the Ngabang site, river transport may be the most efficient
method of moving the site's palm oil production to Pontianak. No road
network exists in the proposed project area.
2.17      PNP VII, the implementing estate has no estates near the proposed
Ngabang site. Its nearest activities are at Sungai Dekan, which is on the



- 20 -
north bank of the Kapuas river some 20 km upstream of Tayan.  Here PNP VII
is establishing an oil palm estate. It plans to build a road due north
connecting the site to the main east-west road running from Sanggau to
Ngabang at Pusat Damai.
2.18      A bitumen road connnects the Seluma site with Bengkulu, the
provincial capital, and present port. The provincial public works is
constructing one bridge (25 m long at 22 km marker from Bengkulu) on this
road, and expects to complete it by December 1982. A bitumen road also
connects the site to the new Bengkulu harbor which the province is
constructing, and is scheduled to complete end-1983. Except for a main
access road PTP XXIII has built about 50% of the way across the project
site, the site presently has no internal road network.
2.19      Existing Services; West Java.  The project area sub-districts
(kecamatans) have a range of health, education and agricultural facilities.
Most have a public health center (Puskesmas), and some a number of smaller
clinics (Poliklinik) as well. Practically all villages have elementary
schools, while about 65% of the kecamatans have primary high schools (grades
7-9), and 20% secondary high schools (grades 10-12). Although 80% of the
kecamatans have agricultural extension services, only one or two extension
staff (usually a field extension worker, PPL) are stationed in each
kecamatan which have 2,000 to 4,500 farm families each. The desired
extension worker/farmer ratio is about one PPL/1,600 farmers. Generally the
agricultural services are more concentrated in the sawah areas, with little
or no services in the upland or kebun areas, that is, the proposed project
areas.
2.20      Existing Services:  West Kalimantan.  The project area is poorly
served by public services. Although Ngabang has a hospital, few of the
project area villages have health clinics or primary schools. Agricultural
services do not exist at the site as it is a shifting cultivation area.
Ngabang kecamatan, the project area kecamatan, has one middle extension
worker (PPM, stationed at Sidas) and two PPLs (stationed in Ngabang, one for
food crops, the other for tree crops).

3. THE PROJECT
3.01       The project consists of three major elements, all interrelated.  The
development of estate and smallholder tree crops; the upgrading of existing
estates so that in future they can promote smallholder development, and
training and technical assistance for the DGE, public and private estates to
improve management capabilities. The project would establish some 45,800 ha
(13,400 ha for the estates, and 32,400 ha for smallholders) of rubber, oil
palm and coconuts, including processing facilities, in the provinces of West
Java, West Kalimantan, and Bengkulu; resettle some 19,800 families in West
Java and West Kalimantan; and establish an estate and processing facilities
for PTP XXIII in Bengkulu. In future this estate would undertake smallholder
development. The project would provide facilities to train management and
field staff for the DGE, public and private estates, and technical assistance
for the DGE and public estates.

Agricultural Development
3.03      West Java.  All project land would be free from title or compensa-
tion disputes, and available for redistribution.  At each site PTP XI or PTP
XIII would pool all land suitable for tree crop planting into blocks of at
least 50 ha, and up to 500 ha. Suitability would depend on slope and present
or potential land use. Because of harvesting difficulties on land too steep,
the estates would plant rubber up to about 35% slope, and oil palm and
coconuts up to about 30% slope. Existing irrigated sawah and suitable flat
areas required for villages, houses and gardens or food crops would not be
planted to tree crops. Each settler family would receive 1.5 ha of block
planted rubber (Sanghyang Damar), or coconuts (Bantar Jaya, Ciemas and
Cimerak), or oil palm (South Banten). The project would redistribute project
area lands so that each existing settler family would be left with at least
0.5 ha for their house, garden and food crops. Any new families moved into an
area (Bantar Jaya and Ciemas), in addition to the 1.5 ha of coconuts, would
also receive a cLeared 0.5 ha for their house and garden (0.2 ha) and food
crops (0.3 ha). The estates would provide these new settlers, and any
existing settlers, whose house is moved (mainly Sanghyang Damar and South
Banten), with a Rp 55,000 (US$88) cash payment to purchase seedlings for the
garden, vegetable and food crop seeds and fertilizers and pesticides. At each
site PTP XI or PTP XIII would make available seedlings, food crop seeds,
fertilizer and pesticides which the smallholders could purchase for their
garden and food crops. PTP XI and PTP XIII would maintain and fertilize the
tree crops until they come into bearing and were transferred to the
smallholders  control.  At this stage (sixth year for rubber, fourth year for
oil palm and fifith year for coconuts) the estates would provide tree crop
extension services, fertilizers and agrochemicals, collection, processing and
marketing services for the smallholders. The smallholders would finance these
services. The existing kecamatan agricultural services would provide food
crop extension services.
3.04       West Kalimantan.  Each smallholder family would receive 3.0 ha, of
which 2.0 ha wouLd be suitable for oil palm, 0.5 ha for house, garden and food
crops, and the remaining 0.5 ha for either food or tree crops.  PNP VII
would clear 2.5 1hta for each family, block planting 2.0 ha with oil palm and
leaving 0.5 ha for house, garden and foodcrops. PNP VII would maintain and
fertilize the tree crops until they reach maturity in the fourth year after
planting and the smallholders become responsible for them. It would supply
each family with an initial package of seedlings, seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides for the garden and food crops.  After the smallholders take control
of their oil palms, PNP VII would provide tree crop extension services,
collection, processing and marketing services, and make available fertilizers
and pesticides which the smallholder can purchase for both his tree and food
crops. The locaL kecamatan agricultural services would supply food crop
extension services.
3.05       BengkuLu.  PTP XXIII would establish a 5,000 ha rubber estate which,
under future sma:llholder development, would be a nucleus estate. Under
start-up activities for the future NES VI project, PTP XXIII would also plant



- 26 -
200 ha of rubber in the proposed future smallholder area as a demonstration
block to assure the local smallholders that the 5,000 ha of rubber is not just
an estate development, but a beginning of smallholder development. The pro-
posed sites are Government land which the Bengkulu Governor has already
alienated for the project.
Physical Development
3.06      Land Clearing and Planting.  Using the prospective settlers and
other labor, the estates would manually clear the sites. They would use
chainsaws on any trees, regrowth or bush, and weedicides on small brushes and
alang-alang. To facilitate the burning of felled timber, the estates would
clear mainly during the dry season (April to September). They would first
underbrush the area, then fell and stack all trees. Before burning, the
debris would need to be left about four months in West Java and West
Kalimantan, and five to six months in Bengkulu. After the first burning the
estates would restack and reburn the area, concurrently spraying with
weedicide any alang-alang areas. Some months later, they would spray any
weeds which had grown during the timber or alang-alang clearing. They would
then manually plant the cover crop, line the tree rows, do any required
terracing, and dig the pits for the trees. Finally, during the wet season,
the estates would plant the tree crops.
3.07      Nurseries.  Nurseries need to be established about twelve months
before planting. In West Java, with start-up funds from NES IV (Loan 1835-
IND), PTP XI has already established nurseries for rubber at Sanghyang
Damar, for oil palm at South Banten, for coconuts at both Bantar Jaya and
Ciemas, and PTP XIII a coconut nursery at Cimerak. Using its own funds PTP
XXIII has established a rubber nursery at Seluma.
3.08      Road Construction.  The estates would establish a network of
access, estate and village roads throughout the proposed sites, and a
network of collection tracks through the plantations. The estate and
village roads would be two standards, primary or secondary, and the estates
would construct a total of some 365 km primary, 610 km secondary roads and
1,900 km collection tracks. Providing all-weather access, primary estate
or village roads would serve as the major access roads to a site or group
of villages. They would have a maximum gradient of 6%, a 6 m pavement width
with a 15 cm laterite gravel surface, and a 15 m right-of-way. Secondary
estate or village roads would give access to the primary roads and or serve
one to two villages. They would have a 7% maximum gradient, a 4 m pavement
width with a 10 cm thick gravel surface, and a 12 m right-of-way. Collection
(farm) tracks would provide access through the tree crop for maintenance and
harvesting. They would be 3 m wide dirt tracks with a 20 cm embankment
height. The estates would construct the major part of the roads and tracks
by force account. Annex 1 gives the estates' required road construction
equipment list, and Figure 1 shows the roads cross-sections.
3.09      Housing and Sanitary Facilities.  In West Java and West Kalimantan
PTP XI, PTP XIII and PNP VII would construct (mainly by contract) about 15,700



- 27 -
smallholder houses (10,200 in West Java, 5,500 in West Kalimantan), and in
West Java, rehab:ilitate another 4,100. Besides building new villages, PTP XI
and XIII would replace any sub-standard houses of existing settlers. The
basic house would be about 30 sq m with an enclosed kitchen (4.5 sq m) and
adjacent porch (4.5 sq m) attached to the back of the house. The houses would
be of timber, or steel and prefabricated materials, with galvanised iron
roofs. Wherever possible locally available materials would be used, and the
maximum possible local employment generated. Within each site the house lots
and housing units would be modular and of uniform design. On each house plot
the estates would construct pit latrines at a minimum 15 m from the house and
potable water supply.  The houses would be ready before the smallholders
arrive on site. Using standard estate designs, the estates would construct
housing for their management and permanent field staff.
3.10      Water Supply.  At the West Java sites existing settlers obtain
potable water from 10-12 m deep wells, or small streams. These sources are
adequate for year round water supplies, and PTP XI and PTP XIII would dig a
well for each new house lot. At Ngabang in West Kalimantan local settlers
obtain potable water from small streams or collect rain from their house
roofs. PNP VII would equip all new houses with guttering, a downpipe and
barrels (1,400 litre capacity) to collect their potable water, or dig a well.
3.11      Village Infrastructure.  Settlement planning and village design
are related to traditional community living patterns and the physical
factors of topography, water supply and access. Generally the villages
would be about 200 families, consisting of a number of small groups or blocks
(25-30 households) arranged around a village center with community facilities.
The villages would be constructed on flat to gently undulating land preferably
with suitable underground water. The settlers' food crop areas would be
adjacent to their house lots and ideally within 0.5 km from them. The
community facilities would include a health post, village office, market,
hall, place of worship, school and sports ground. The estates would construct
all the village infrastructure except the health and education facilities
which the Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC, see para. 4.09) would
construct, using funds the central government makes available under local
infrastructure development programs (INPRES). In West Java PTP XI would
construct about 46 villages (10 in Sanghyang Damar, 24 in South Banten, 3 in
Bantar Jaya and 9 in Ciemas). Some new villages are required to settle
farmers near to their proposed tree crop plantings, while the project would
move additional settlers to Bantar Jaya and Ciemas and new villages are
required to accommodate them.  In West Kalimantan PNP VII would construct
about 27 villages, of which three would be main villages, containing
additional public building and services, for example, a bank, post office and
lower secondary school.



- 28 -
3.12      Processing Facilities.  The estates would construct sufficient pro-
cessing capacity to handle their own and the smallholder's production. Table
3.1 gives the crop produced at each site; estimated total daily production
(smallholders and nucleus estate where relevant) during the final year of
project implementation (1987), in 1990, and at maximum area production; and
the installed processing capacity under the project, and that required at
maximum production. Under the project the estates would install the total
required processing capacity for rubber at Seluma, as constructing by stages
would give only minimal savings. However, for all other areas they would
install processing capacity by stages. At Sanghyang Damar, PTP XI would
install buildings for processing 30 tons/day of rubber but equipment for only
15 tons/day. It would process the smallholders low grade rubber at its
existing Sanghyang Damar estate factory. At South Banten and Ngabang, PTP XI
and PNP VII would install the first 35-ton and 30-ton lines respectively for
the palm oil mills, while at both Bantar Jaya and Ciemas, for the initial
coconut processing capacity, PTP XI would install two 12.5 ton/day copra
presses. At Cimerak PTP XIII would install only kilns to convert the coconut
meat to copra as total area production would be insufficient to justify copra
presses for oil production until around 1990. At all sites the completion of
required processing capacity could be considered for Bank financing under
subsequent loans if requested by GOI. The rubber factory costs have been
estimated to allow either 100% crumb rubber production or a mixture of crumb
and sheet rubber. The estates would be responsible for installing, operating
and maintaining all processing facilities. The project provides, however,

grade rubber (about seven ton/day) at its existing Sanghyang Damar
factory.
/f Project would install only kilns to produce copra.
for consultant assistance to prepare specifications, terms of reference and
tender documents, and supervise the installation of the project rubber, oil
palm and copra processing facilities (para. 3.25). An assurance was obtained
from OI that PTP XI, PNP VII, and PTP XXIII would hire consultants for this
work with qualifications and under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank. PTP XI would construct its palm oil mill and copra oil extraction
factories on a turnkey basis, using a single prime contractor for each mill.
The palm oil mills would take about 36 months from design commencement to
commissioning, aad the copra factories about 33 months. Assurances were ob-
tained from GOI that: (a) PTP XI would complete its palm oil mill by
January 31, 1985, and PNP VII by January 31, 1986; and (b) if these mills were
not in operation by these dates, GOI would adequately compensate smallholders
for any oil palm production offerred for sale to PTP XI after January 31, 1985
and PNP VII after January 31, 1986.

Settlement and Community Development
3.13      Recruitment and Selection.  In West Java the smallholders would come
from those presently cultivating project lands either as owners or renters of
private land (Tanah Milik), or as leasers or squatters on government land
(Tanah Negara). After these groups, residents of the project kecamatan and
kabupaten would have priority. The Provincial Government has already made a
census of all cultivators within the proposed sites and is obtaining land
owners' agreement to give title of the land required for project purposes.
Those leasing or squatting on government land have also given to the project
any rights to the areas they were cultivating. Although existing right
holders would become project beneficiaries, they would not necessarily receive
back under the project the same amount of land they had preproject. In
allocating project lands, preference would be given to small farmers or the
landless. Farmers who own or cultivate land both outside and inside the
project area may have to give their rights to a project block to a married
child. Cultivators from sites which have insufficient suitable land to allow
each existing cultivator a tree crop block (for example South Banten) would be
given the opportunity to move to another site with excess land (Bantar Jaya
and Ciemas). All project beneficiaries would have to live within the project
boundaries, and may have to move to a project village. Beneficiaries would be
married couples, aged 20 to 60 years. Those between 40 and 60 years should
have children. The project manager would consider on a case by case basis the
age limit for existing settlers.  The PCC and project manager would select the
smallholders to enter the project.
3.14      In West Kalimantan the smallholders would consist of all the present
families living in the project area (500 families), small farmers (1.0 ha or
less) selected from the adjacent areas (5,000 families). The West Kalimantan
FCC would select the local smallholders, and with PNP VII, transport them to
the site.
3.15      PTP XI, PTP XIII and PNP VII would hire one male member of each
smallholder family as a permanent estate laborer, and guarantee him a
permanent job until the estates hand over to the smallholder the operation
of their individual holdings. The estates would train the smallholders in
planting and maintenance of immature trees, and harvesting and maintenance
of mature trees. To obtain control of their holdings the smallholders must
prove themselves satisfactory estate laborers/trainees and willing to work
and live on their tree crop holding.
3.16      Land Allocation.  In West Java the PCC, in association with the
Directorate General of Agrarian Affairs (DGA), where necessary would provide
all families with the right of use title (Hak pakai) to 0.5 ha for house,
garden and food crops within one year of project works commencements in the
area. In West Kalimantan the PCC, also in association with DGA, would
provide all smallholders with hak pakai to 1.0 ha (house lot of 0.2 ha, food
crop 0.3 ha, remaining 0.5 ha suitable for either food crops or tree crops)
within one year of their arrival. At all sites the PCC's and' DGA would
provide the smallholders judged satisfactory settlers with land ownership



- 31 -
title (hak milik) to their entire holding within three years after settlement.
The Bank Rakyati Indonesia (BRI) however, would retain the hak milik certifi-
cates as security until the smallholders repay their debt incurred under the
project (para. 4.13). The provincial and kabupaten DGA would do the cadastral
survey necessary to define each smallholder's holding. Each smallholder would
receive a tree crop block containing the number of trees equivalent to 1.5 ha
of rubber, coconut or oil palm in West Java, or 2.0 ha of oil palm in West
Kalimantan, rather than an exact 1.5 or 2.0 ha block.
3.17      Subsistence.  In West Java each family moved onto a new house lot
and foodcrop area, and all smallholder families in West Kalimantan would
receive Rp 50,000 (US$80) initial cash payment for food and transportation
before arrival at the project site. This would be in addition to Rp 55,000
for the purchase of inputs (para. 3.02 - 3.03).
3.18      Health.  The West Java and West Kalimantan provincial governments,
through their PCCs, would provide, using INPRES funds, health care facilities
in the project areas to Repelita III standards. The PCC's would construct
health centers (Puskesmas) and subhealth centers (sub-puskesmas) where neces-
sary. The provincial health authorities would staff and operate the centers.
Health services, with a primary health care approach, would focus on malaria
control, immunization, nutrition, family planning and environmental sanita-
tion. Malaria control would include house spraying, malariometric surveys and
treatment.
3.19      Education.  Using INPRES funds the West Java and West Kalimantan
PCC's would be responsible for constructing an elementary school (Grades 1 to
6) in each new village (about 46 in West Java, 27 in West Kalimantan). The
project would provide funds for two lower secondary school (SMP, grades 7 to
9) in West Kalimantan. The Directorate General of Education would construct
the secondary schools, and be responsible for their staffing.
Estates Training Institute Extension
3.20      The project would provide assistance for GOI to upgrade and expand
its training programs for tree crop staff, that is, for those in the public
and private sector estates. If necessary, it could later include tree crop
staff in the DGE at central and provincial levels.  Project assistance would
expand the present upper management training activities of the LPP, and also
develop field staff training at centers established at selected estates.
3.21      NES E provided funds to develop the LPP's (Yogyakarta) staff and
training programs. This included:
(a)  internationally recruiting four advisors for three years each to
assist in reorganizing the LPP along functional lines, identify
tree crop sector training needs, prepare suitable training
programs, and plan the establishment of an LPP subcenter at Medan,
North Sumatra;



- 32 -
(b) local and overseas training for LPP lecturers and selected PNP/PTP
senior managers; and
(c) about 10 additional lecturers at the LPP.
LPP's consultants (five actually recruited) have now developed their proposals
for reorganizing the LPP, additional training programs and establishing an LPP
at Medan. The Bank and GOI have reviewed, discussed and accepted these
proposals.
3.22      The project would provide the facilities needed for implementing
these training programs. The LPP in Yogyakarta (and proposed LPP Medan) would
remain as centers for vocational courses, in-service training, project
management, and refresher courses. All basic plantation management and field
work courses would be conducted at LPP subcenters established in the field.
The LPP would subdivide its programs into a Management Development Center, a
Smallholder/Estate Training and Information Development Center, and an
Agro-Technology Development Center. With the establishment of these centers,
LPP would be able to assist with the training of smallholders. It would
establish another LPP at Medan which would concentrate more on rubber, oil
palm, and coconut technology as opposed to LPP Yogyakarta which, besides the
above mentioned activities, concentrates on sugar technology. The project
would provide transport, library, training consultants and laboratory
equipment for the Yogyakarta and Medan centers.
3.23      The LPP would also establish four subcenters or Field Training
Centers (FTC), two in Java and two in Sumatra for training field staff. LPP
would establish these centers on existing estates so that the trainees could
have maximum field exposure during training. These centers would be the first
stage of a larger field work training program, which could consist of
additional FTCs and possibly Training Schools attached to existing Project
Management Units.  The FTCs would train estate assistants, estate foremen and
field extension workers, and each FTC would conduct courses annually for about
200 estate assistants and about an equal number of foremen and extension
workers.
3.24      The SBPN, through the LPP, would implement the proposed training
program. It would establish a Board of Trustees (BOT) to advise the LPPs on
training needs and the implementation programs. The BOT would consist of
representatives from the Agency for Agricultural Education, Training and
Extension (AAETE), the Team Khusus, SBPN, LPP, local universities, involved
estates and the DGE's directorate of planning. The AAETE is the agency within
the Department of Agriculture responsible for all agricultural education and
training programs. Through the BOT the AAETE would participate in the
establishment and operation of the FTCs. The SBPN, through the LPPs, would
establish and operate this expansion of training since the proposed training
is specialized and initially aimed at only estate staff, and AAETE at present
does not have the capacity to undertake additional training programs.  SBPN
may transfer the operation of the FTCs to the AAETE in the future. Addition-
ally, if necessary, the FTCs could also train field staff for Project



- 33 -
Management Units. To ensure efficient implementation of this expansion of
training, GOI has agreed to: (a) establish a BOT for the LPPs and appoint to
it an executive director and other members by October 31, 1981; and (b) en-
gage additiona] qualified personnel to adequately staff the LPPs at Jogjakarta
and Medan by January 31, 1982.
Technical Assistance and Program Support
3.25      To assist the DGE and individual estates implement the project,
and the DGE in its overall smallholder development programs, the project
would provide the following consultant services:
(a) To assist with the preparation of future projects the DGE would
internationally recruit one land classifier/geomorphologist to
be attached to the Team Khusus for two years. His contract would be
signed and he would be ready to start work by December 31, 1981.
This consultant would collect data and do resource surveys to screen
areas suitable for tree crop development, suggest the additional
surveys and data collection necessary to formulate, prepare and
design projects at promising sites, and train Indonesia counterparts
in this work (32 man-months, including 8 man-month for short term
specialists). DGE would also hire local consultants to assist the
international consultant screen and prepare future tree crop
projects (92 man-months);
(b) To assist with project implementation DGE would extend the contracts
of existing specialists attached to Team Khusus, or would interna-
tionailly recruit and attach to the Team Khusus:
(i)  a rubber production agronomist (12 man-months, contract signed
by September 30, 1982);
(ii) an oil palm production agronomist (24 man-months, contract
signed by November 30, 1981);
(iii) a rural settlement physical planner to supervise and coordinate
the work of local village design consultants PTP XI, XIII and
PNP VII would employ (24 man-months, contract signed by October
31, 1981):
(iv) a financial expert with a procurement background who would be
additional to the financial expert already with Team Khusus (24
man-months, contract signed by November 30, 1981); and the
extension of the existing financial expert from July 31, 1982
(12 man-months); and
(v) a palm oil processing engineer (24 man-months, contract
signed by December 31, 1981);



- 34 -
(c)  PTP XXIII would internationally recruit a financial expert to assist
with financial management of the estate and training of counterparts
(24 man-month contract signed by October 31, 1981, plus an addi-
tional 12 months for short-term follow-ups);
(d) PTP XI would internationally recruit consultants to design, prepare
tender documents and specifications, assist evaluate the tenders
received, and supervise construction of the proposed palm oil mill
at South Banten (34 man-months, contract signed by January 31,
1982); and consultants to prepare tender documents, assist in
contractor selection, evaluate contractors proposals regarding
machinery and layout and supervise construction of the proposed
copra oil extraction plants at Bantar Jaya and Ciemas (16 man-months
for each factory, contract signed by January 31, 1982), and a rubber
factory at Sanghyang Damar (9 man-months);
(e) PNP VII would internationally recruit consultants to design, prepare
tender documents and specifications, assist evaluate the tenders
received and supervise construction of the proposed palm oil mill
at Ngabang (34 man-months, contract signed by January 31, 1981);
(f) PTP XXIII would internationally recruit consultants to design,
prepare tender documents and specifications, assist evaluate
tenders and supervise construction of the proposed rubber mill at
Seluma (9 man-months);
(g) PTP XI would locally recruit consultants to site and design the
smallholder village, food crop area layouts and roads (80 man-
months, contract signed by October 31, 1981);
(h) PTP XIII would locally recruit consultants to site and design
project area layout and roads (20 man-months, contract signed by
October 31, 1981);
(i) PNP VII would locally recruit consultants to site and design
smallholder villages, crop area layouts and roads (80 man-months,
contract signed by October 31, 1981):
(j) LPP would internationally recruit consultants to act as resident
advisers for the Management Development Center at Yogyakarta (one
man for 15 man-months), Agro-Technology Development Center at
Medan (one man for 15 man-months), and Smallholder Estate Training
and Information Development Center (one man at both Yogjakarta and
Medan for 15 man-months each). LPP would also internationally re-
cruit consultants for short-term visits (20 man-months); and
(k) LPP would locally recruit consultants for short-term visits (25
man-months).

An assurance was obtained from GOI that the agencies would have signed con-
tracts and finalized arrangements for engaging consultants with qualifications
and under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank by the dates specified
in the earlier subparagraphs.
3.26      Within DGE the Team Khusus has three main functions concerning
smallholder tree crop projects: (a) the preparation of these projects which
foreign funds would assist finance; (b) the monitoring and inspection of their
implementation; and (c) general support to the Director-General of the DGE.
Presently, Team Khusus has 18 graduate staff recruited from either the PNPs/
PTPs or from thie DGE for these duties. As the Team Khusus is undertaking a
new function within DGE, and was only recently established (late 1979), the
project would provide funds (US$600,000) for short-term overseas training of
Team Khusus staff. This would help strengthen Team Khusus for its existing
tasks, and start preparing it for a larger role in the preparation and
appraisal of future Bank-assisted projects.
Status of Engineering
3.27      Topographical maps at 1:50,000 scale exist for ail sites showing
height interval contours and drainage patterns. DGA has prepared 1:10,000



- 36 -
scale present land use maps for the West Java sites. Sufficient soils infor-
mation is available for all sites including South Banten and Ngabang where PTP
XI and PNP VII have recently undertaken additional soil topography and vegeta-
tion surveys. All estates have either established or selected the sites for
nurseries to supply the initial year's planting, and defined the boundaries
for the first year's land clearing. All estates have prepared outline plans,
presented on existing topographical maps, showing project layout and prelimi-
nary road alignments. Ngabang site would be aerially photographed at 1:20,000
scale during the 1981 dry season to assist smallholder development planning.
Standard designs exist for all smallholder and estate housing, village
infrastructure and roads.
Implementation Schedule
3.28      GOI would implement the project during six years from late 1981 to
October 1987. Chart 3 shows the start and finish of major project works.
During the first 24 months the activities most crucial to project implemen-
tation would be smallholder and estate housing, access roads into the project
sites, land clearing and nursery establishment. In West Kalimantan and Beng-
kulu particularly, housing would be crucial for the estates to assemble a
labor force.
Cost Estimates
3.29      GOI would fully implement the project over ten years.  The Bank loan
would assist finance the project over, the first six years.  Total estimated
project cost is US$322 million for this period, of which US$161 million (50%)
is the foreign exchange component. GOI would finance all project costs
(US$100 million) from year seven to completion.  Project costs are expressed
in mid-1981 prices and, because of the tax exempt status of the implementing
agencies, do not include taxes.
3.30      Base cost estimates were derived from detailed cost analyses of
recent field development, house, infrastructure and road construction of
several estates, including PTP XI, XIII, XXIII and PNP VII. Smallholder
housing costs have been based on contract prices in neighboring areas, and
community facilities, schools and health center costs have been based on
BAPPENAS standards and unit construction costs obtained in similar projects.
Consultant service costs are based on recent contracts for similar services in
Indonesia.  Estimated direct and reimbursable costs are US$10,000/month for
foreign consultants and US$2,500/month for local consultants. The cost
estimates include an allowance for physical contingencies of 15% for housing,
infrastructure and roads, and 10% for field development, services, equipment
and supplies. The cost estimates also include allowances for price
escalations during implementation (40% of base cost plus physical
contingencies) based on the following price contingencies:

Financing
3.31      The proposed Bank loan of US$161 million would finance the project's
estimated full foreign exchange cost for the first six years of project
implementation. GOI would provide to the project implementing agencies
Rp 87.5 billion (US$140 million) out of annual budget appropriations, and the
participating estates Rp 13.1 billion (US$21 million).
3.32      Nucleus Estate Development.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would
finance the bulk of local costs for nucleus estates' tree crop plantings,
infrastructure, road building and agricultural equipment. PTP XI, PTP XXIII



- 38 -
and PNP VII, who have a sound financial standing and profitability levels,
would finance part of local costs for processing facilities and tree crop
establishment. Their total contribution would be 10% of project investment
under their direct responsibility, and would be financed from retained
earnings or accrued income tax.
3.33      Smallholder Development.  Smallholders would repay part of their
development costs, that is for the credit items of tree crop planting, sub-
sistence payments, settler housing, roads, and tree crop development overheads
(calculated as 10% of the tree crop establishments costs). They would not
repay the noncredit items of water supply, village infrastructure, education
and health facilities, and project management (calculated as 5% of the tree
crop establishment costs and paid to the implementing estate). The MOF would
provide the funds for all smallholder credit and noncredit items. The Bank
Loan would fund the foreign exchange costs. INPRES program funds would be
used for noncredit items such as health and education facilities.  GOI also
would provide the Rp 625 billion (US$100 million) required to carry out the
project in Years 7-10. These funds would maintain smallholder and nucleus
estate plantings while they are immature, and would come from MOF and the
estates. Sources for all project finance for the first six years are detailed
in Annex 1, Table 3 and are summarized in Table 3.5 on the following page.
3.34      Budgetary Allocations.  The MOF, as at present, would channel
smallholder development funds directly to the nucleus estates through
quarterly disbursements in accordance with an approved annual budget and in
advance of the expenditures as required by the nucleus estates. Bank funds
would be used to reimburse expenditures by PNP/PTPs based on the disbursement
percentages for the works as carried out (para. 3.41). The costs of develop-
ment of smallholder credit items would be translated into standardized credit
amounts for individual settlers in credit agreements at the end of the year
when each tree crop area has come into maturity (see para. 5.14). Bank Rakyat
Indonesia (BRI) would be the designated bank to recover smallholders' out-
standing debts. Subloans to smallholders would be for 17 years, with a two-
year grace period and repayments starting in the sixth year after planting for
oil palm and coconuts, and a three year grace period and repayments starting
in year seven for rubber. Interest would be 10.5% p.a. The MOF would allo-
cate funds for nucleus estate development quarterly in accordance with a
previously agreed annual expenditure budget. Bank Indonesia (BI) would make
these funds available to the participating PNPs/PTPs under the terms of a
subsidiary loan agreement. Loans would be for 13 years, including a sevenyear
grace period, and would be repayable in 12 equal biannual installments.
Interest rates would be 13.5%, and payable from the date of signing of the
subsidiary loan agreement. The signing of these loans between the BI and the
estates in a form and substance satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of
disbursing against the works the individual estates would undertake with the
loan.

Onlending Interest Rates
3.35      Under the NES program the GOI has an established interest rate
policy of lending or onlending public funds to smallholders at 10.5%, and to
public sector estates at 13.5%. With inflation rates projected at 15% for
1982, and then falling to about 10% thereafter, the interest rate for small-
holders would 'be slightly negative in real terms. However, this interest
rate is justified for the present project since smallholder beneficiaries are
below the abso'lute poverty level, and GOI wishes to assist this target group.



- 40 -
Procurement
3.36      Agricultural machinery (US$5.3 million), road construction equipment
(US$16.4 million), rubber processing equipment (US$2.5 million), and palm oil
and copra extraction factories and equipment (US$41.0 million) would be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. cost or the
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to qualified local
manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Equipment, spare parts, and supplies
costing less than US$50,000 could be locally or internationally procured
through prudent shopping involving at least three price quotations. The total
procured in this manner would be limited to the aggregate amount of US$6.0
million. Additionally, the estates could each procure locally one unit or set
of road construction machinery and equipment (including items costing more
than US$50,000 each) for initial road works through prudent shopping involving
at least three price quotations. The total procured in this manner would be
limited to the aggregate amount of US$1.8 million.  To the extent possible DGE
would centrally procure road construction equipment and agricultual machinery
for the estates, using the minimum number of contracts. The estates would
construct the palm oil and copra oil extraction factories using a limited
number of contracts, this number to be agreed-between the Bank and the
estates, and, if considered necessary, on a turnkey basis. Because GOI does
not allow importation of vehicles, all vehicles and motor cycles would be
procured locally following GOI procedures. ICB in accordance with Bank Guide-
lines, would be used for fertilizers (excluding urea) and agrochemicals
(US$9.3 million). Up to US$1.0 million for agrochemicals could be procured
annually following prudent shopping procedures with each PNP/PTP obtaining at
least three quotations. Since P.T. Pusri is the sole producer, supplier and
distributor for urea in Indonesia, and since world market prices are about
twice as high as the price from Pusri, and foreign bidders would not be inte-
rested in tendering, urea (US$4.0 million) would be procured directly from
Pusri or its authorized distributors and would not require competitive bid-
ding.
3.37      Contracts for consultants' services (US$4.6million) would be awarded
in accordance with Bank guidelines on the uses of consultant.
3.38      Excluding buildings for palm oil and copra oil processing facili-
ties, civil works contracts for housing, project and processing plant build-
ings, settlement and estate infrastructure (US$75.2 million), which are small
and widely scattered in area and time span, and with no contract more than
about US$2.0 million, would not be of interest to international contractors.
These works would be carried out following local competitive bidding proce-
dures which are acceptable to the Bank or by force account if suitable
contractors are not timely available or if the estates can do the work cheaper
than contractors. Assurances were obtained from GOI that: (a) the works
would be grouped into a number of suitable contracts (minimum size whenever
feasible US$320,000) that would enable large local contractors or joint
'entures of small local firms to bid; and (b) documents for local contracts



- 41 -
to cost US$320,000 or more would be submitted to the Bank for review before
tendering and award. Contracts below US$320,000 would be awarded using GOI
procurement procedures./1
3.39      The detailed physical description of the work relating to 32,400 ha
smallholder tree crops with maintenance up to three years for oil palm, four
years for cocon:ut, and five years for rubber would be governed by a
Smallholder Development Agreement between the DGE and the nucleus estate.
Tree crop development involves the execution of a specialized, integrated
service of labor and machinery which cannot be procured through a competitive
bidding process. Land clearing, as part of tree crop development would
utilize the services of the PNP/PTPs directly involved whenever possible to
better coordinate all aspects of tree crop development and would not involve a
competitive bidding process. Unit cost information for tree crop development
is well established and would be used to monitor financial requirements and
guarantee quality control. Other works that must be integrated with tree crop
development by the nucleus estates and phased over an extended period of time,
would not involve a competitive bidding process. These include the initial
land clearing by PNP/PTPs for food crop and house and garden areas for each
family and the construction and upgrading of primary and secondary village
roads and farm tracts.
Disbursements
3.40      Disbursements would be made at the following rates:
(a) 35% of tree crop development expenditures including all land
clearing and overheads, but excluding agrochemicals, vehicles
and equipment, as certified in quarterly reports provided by
the PNPs/PTPs to DGE;
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditures for agrochemicals or 90% of
local expenditures for prudent shopping, and 100% of the total
cost of urea (ex-factory);
(c) 100% of foreign exchange cost of agricultural and processing
machinery and equipment, 95% of the ex-factory cost of equipment
manufactured locally and 60% of imported farm equipment purchased
locally;
(d) 35% of the civil works including roads, smallholder and estate
housing, buildings, garages, workshops and divisional offices; and
(e) 100% of the cost of all consultant services, and start-up
expenditures for future Bank-assisted NES projects.
/1 The procedures include provisions to strengthen locally based firms,
and firms owned by weak economic groups.



_ 42 -
The Bank would not disburse for vehicles, motorcycles, smallholder and staff
relocation expenses, and payments for subsistence and seeds and fertilizer
packages. An estimated schedule of disbursements, based on actual disburse-
ment rates for the earlier NES projects, is shown in Annex 1, Table 4.
Documentation made under Statements of Expenditure (see Annex 7), supporting
claims for rubber, oil palm and coconut development expenditures, including
overheads not submitted for reimbursement, would be retained in Indonesia and
made available for inspection and review by Bank supervision missions.
Accounts and Audits
3.41      PNP/PTPs participating under the project would keep separate
accounts for all investment costs relating to NES V smallholders as well as
nucleus estate project implementation, and would provide such accounts as part
of a separate quarterly report to the DGE and the Bank no later than 30 days
from the end of the quarter. Beginning with NES I, PNP/PTPs have been stand-
ardizing their bookkeeping procedures and accounting methodology following
procedures agreed to by the Bank and GOI. This has facilitated auditing. The
new methodology has enabled the State Auditor to audit an increasing number of
PNP/PTP accounts.
3.42      PNP/PTPs participating in the project are presently audited by
Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firms.  NES V project accounts and related
disbursements made under statements of expenditures, would be audited by
private CPA firms acceptable to the Bank, and the audit reports would be
submitted to the GOI and the Bank no later than August first each year. State
auditing may eventually substitute CPA auditing when accounts of these PNP/
PTPs' would have been standardized, and capacity of the State Auditor
improved. An assurance was obtained from GOI that these auditing practices
would be followed.
3.43      The DGE would submit quarterly reports on the project's progress to
the Bank using the format already agreed to by the Bank and Team Khusus under
earlier NES projects.
Environmental Effects
3.44      The project would establish tree and food crops in areas of
secondary jungle and alang-alang where a poor economic and ecological pattern
of shifting cultivation is presently practiced. Standard soil conservation
methods would be followed to prevent soil erosion as in other DGE managed
projects. With the establishment of a leguminous cover crop, soil fertility
would be improved by the application of fertilizers, crop rotation and
fallowing of food crop land. The small quantities of chemicals used to
control alang alang, pests. and diseases would have no significant adverse
environmental effects. The new rubber, oil palm and copra factories would
adopt the appropriate standards for the disposal of liquid effluent to ensure
that it is nontoxic and that it would not harm the health and safety of
factory employees or the preservation of fish and wildlife.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
4.01      The Department of Agriculture (DOA) consists of five Directorates
General, Estates, Fisheries, Food Crops Agriculture, Forestry and Livestock,
and DOA Estate Administration and Support Staff (SBPN). The DGE regulates
all private estates and smallholdings involving tree crops and industrial
crops such as rubber, coconuts, oil palm, tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, and
spices. The DGE has five directorates, Planning, Production, Operations,
Rehabilitation and Development, and Plant Protection (Chart 1). To help the
directorates manage the increasing number of externally-financed projects the
DGE has recently established a Special Team for Externally Assisted Projects
(Team Khusus). It has 18 staff, and three consultants (attached to the DGE)
one for finance, one for production management, and one for rubber and coconut
agronomy (see para. 4.07).
4.02      The Indonesian Estates Industry includes 28 public sector estates
(PNP/PTPs). All of the PNP/PTPs are responsible to the SBPN, which assists
the Minister of Agriculture with policy formulation, coordination of estate
crop activities, estate financial administration and control, and monitoring
of the operations of the estates. The DGE has no direct authority for these
public estates, but is responsible for their supervision when used as agents
for smallholder development.
4.03      The Provincial Estate Crop Services (Dinas Perkebunan
Daerahs - DPDs) handle development activities at the provincial and district
levels. The DPDs are responsible to the DGE through the administration of
the provincial governments. Provincial extension services to smallholder
tree crops are inadequate in quantity, and sometimes in quality. The DPDs
have experience in rubber and coconut production, but not with oil palm.
4.04      Three other ministries are involved in the tree crops industry.
They are the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives, which regulates product
specification and quality control; the Ministry of Industry, which licenses
processors; and the Ministry of Finance, which, with the approval of the
National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), provides funds for
development.
4.05      Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the Government commercial bank for the
agricultural and rural sector, operates with 330 branches and 3,270 village
units throughout Indonesia. BRI's main function is to assist the GOI with
policies and programs to provide short-term credit to agricultural coopera-
tives, farmers, fishermen and agricultural enterprises. Short-term credits



- 44 -
account for about 95% of BRI's total portfolio.  It has gained some experi-
ence in long-term credit operations under the Smallholder and Private
Estates Tea project (Credit 400-IND) and the Fisheries Credit Project
(Credit 480-IND), and serves as channelling agency for smallholder rubber and
oil palm finance under the North Sumatra Smallholder Development Project
(Credit 358-IND) and the NES I, II, III and IV Projects (Loans 1499, 1604,
751 and 1835-IND respectively). BRI's operating efficiency has been strained,
however, by the rapid expansion of its operations since the early 1970s when
the farm credit and inputs (BIMAS) program expanded nationwide. Given its
limited experience in long-term credit operations, and the pressure to
rapidly expand its credit operations to new development areas in the Other
Islands, the GOI has assisted BRI by bearing the credit risk on about 60% of
its total loan portfolio.  The BRI is now being assisted in term lending and
credit management procedures by a team of five consultants financed under
the Rural Credit Project (Credit 827-IND).
Project Management
4.06      The DGE would have overall responsibility for executing the project.
The Team Khusus would have primary responsibility for coordinating project
implementation, while the estates would be responsible and mainly undertake
the individual project works. At the individual sites the nucleus estates
(PTP XI, PTP XIII and PNP VII) would implement smallholder development, with
the assistance of central government agencies and the West Java and West
Kalimantan provincial governments. These, and the other estate (PTP XXIII),
would develop processing facilities and other estate civil works and plantings
with guidance and supervision from the SBPN. For both smallholder and estate
development, the First Director of the implementing estate would be the
project manager, and for the individual sites the PNP/PTP concerned would
appoint one of its estate managers as site manager.
4.07      Team Khusus.  Team Khusus would coordinate project implementation
for the DGE. Its specific functions would include assistance to the project
managers and nucleus estates to prepare annual work programs and budgets,
assist with financial administration and guide in technical, engineering and
project procurement matters.  In practice, Team Khusus would assist the
project manager with the administrative aspects of projects required at
central government level. It would also monitor and evaluate project
implementation, providing the inspection services of field development. To
enable the Team Khusus give technical advice on tree crop production,
village design and farm layout, and financial matters it would recruit
additional international and local consultants in these fields (para. 3.25
and para. 4.01).
4.08      Project Manager.  Each of the project managers would prepare an
annual work program and budget, including quarterly cost estimates for all
works the nucleus estate would undertake for the smallholders, which the
Team Khusus would review and approve on behalf of the DGE before submitting
it to the MOF. The project managers would also be responsible for annual



- 45 -
budget requests for the noncredit expenditures of health and educational faci-
lities financed from the INPRES programs. The DGE would make its own budget
allocation for technical assistance under the project. An assurance was
obtained from GOI that the project managers, assisted by the Team Khusus,
would prepare and submit to the DGE annual work programs and budgets by
October 31 each year.
4.09      Nucleus Estates.  The nucleus estates would have full authority to
establish the smallholdings, village infrastructure, roads and processing
facilities. The :DGE would make a Smallholder Development Agreement with the
nucleus estates for tree crop development, extension, processing and marketing
services. The signing of these agreements in a form and substance satisfac-
tory to the Bank is a condition of disbursing for the works the individual
estates would undertake under the agreement. Under this agreement's terms and
conditions, the nucleus estates would be responsible for the following
services:
(a)  During Tree Crop Immature Period.  Land clearing of tree crop,
house and garden and food crop area; planting and maintaining
the tree crops; procuring and applying inputs for the tree
crops' development; siting houses and villages and constructing
settler houses, water supply and sanitation facilities; develop-
ing the village infrastructure, excluding health and education
facilities; constructing and maintaining of primary and secondary
village roads and estate and farm access tracks; resettling the
smallholders, the providing of an initial subsistence cash payment
(Rp 50,000), a seeds and fertilizer cash payment (Rp 55,000) or a
package of seedlings, food crop and vegetable seeds, fertilizers
and pesticides for the West Kalimantan smallholders and any West
Java smallholders moved into a site; the supplying of seedlings,
food crop seeds, and agrochemicals for sale to smallholders at the
various sites; and the employing full time of one member of each
family and training in tree crop establishment and maintenance;
and
(b)  During rree Crop Productive Period.  Supplying the smallholders
extension services, training them in harvesting practices, collect-
ing their production for processing and loan recovery, and pro-
viding marketing services.
To assist PTP XI, PTP XIII and PNP VII in providing processing facilities,
they would recruit international consultants. They also would recruit local
consultants to assist them with village design, layout of smallholder's
holdings and the alignment of primary roads (para. 3.25).
4.10      Estates.  PTP XXIII would undertake all project works to establish
and maintain their tree crop plantings. Except in financial management, PTP
XXIII has sufficient managerial and technical expertise to implement its
portion of the project. PTP XXIII would internationally recruit a financial



- 46 -
expert to assist with the day-to-day financial management of the estate, and
training of counterparts.
4.11      Provincial Governments.  The West Java and West Kalimantan provin-
cial governments would supply the smallholders with health, education, social
and food crops extension services. The Chairman of the Provincial Develop-
ment Planning Agency (BAPPEDA), assisted by the nucleus estate project
manager, would coordinate local government INPRES programs to construct
health and educational facilities upon the arrival of the settlers. The
kabupaten health authorities would ensure malaria control by supplying DDT,
chloroquine and house spraying. Existing GOI programs would provide mother
and child health care, including nutrition and family planning.
4.12      Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC).  The West Java provincial
government has alredy established a PCC to assist the project. Its members
include the heads of the various project area kabupatens (Bupatis), the head
of the DPD, the project managers (First Directors PTP XI and PTP XIII), the
site managers, the provincial head of the BRI, and representatives of other
relevant provincial government agencies. So far the PCC has conducted a
census of all families wihin the proposed project sites to determine their
willingness to enter the project, and has arranged the alienation of private
and government land for the project.  In the future the PCC would:
(a)  arrange the construction, (under INPRES programs), of health and
education facilities in the project areas;
(b)  in association with the project managers, select the prospective
smallholders and determine their suitability for tree crop
farming;
(c)  expedite the granting of hak pakai and hak milik to the small-
holders; and
(d)  ensure adequate food crop extension services are available for
the smallholders.
4.13      Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI).  The BRI would be the handling bank for
recovery of smallholder debt obligations. On behalf of GOI, BRI would enter
into smallholder credit agreements with each smallholder family when the
smallholder receives hak milik to his holding, some three years after settle-
ment.  The nucleus estates would deduct and transfer to the BRI the small-
holders' repayments from their production, which it would process and market
for him (see para. 5.14). GOI would pay the BRI a handling fee of 1% or less
on the total outstanding loans for this service.
4.14      Bank Indonesia (BI).  The BI would on-lend MOF funds to the estates
(see para. 3.35).

Agricultural Support Services for Smallholders
4.15      When the tree crops reach maturity (four years for oil palm, five
for coconut, and six years for rubber), and the smallholders receive control
of their trees, the nucleus estates would supply the smallholders extension,
processing and marketing services. The nucleus estates would organize the
smallholders into groups of about 20 farmers, each of which would elect a
group leader. The estates would provide a chief foreman, with an extensive
knowledge of crop pests and diseases and fertilizer requirements, who would
supervise about five smallholder groups. The chief foreman would report all
pest and disease outbreaks to the estate which would supply the necessary
pesticides for the smallholders to apply.  If necessary, the estate would
provide back-up technical advice for the chief foreman, and diagnose difficult
to recognize pests and diseases. The estate would also procure all the
smallholders' fertilizer requirements, and, at the correct time, bring it
already mixed to the smallholders' village, supplying him with a measure to
apply the correct amount of fertilizer per tree. The chief foreman would
organize and supervise his groups to apply fertilizer. The estate would have
a 90 sq m building in each village, consisting of a 36 sq m office for the
chief foreman, and a 54 sq m warehouse (godown).
4.16      Harvesting and Collection.  The estate would organize harvesting or
tapping schools of about one week for the smallholders.  The estates would
collect for processing all the smallholders' production from designated
collection spots throughout the smallholder area. To ensure regular,
continuous harvesting, and efficient use of collection services, the estates
would allocate smallholder groups a fixed time and period to harvest.
4.17      Marketing Services.  Following processing the estates would market
the smallholder's production. The estates would subtract from the small-
holder's gross proceeds all his fertilizer, pesticide, tree crop advisory
services, collection, processing and marketing costs, and would pay him once
a week for his production (see para. 5.10).
4.18      Gardens and Food Crops.  In West Java PTP XI and PTP XIII would
give each smallholder they move into a new area Rp 55,000 cash payment to buy
initial perennial garden seedlings, food crop seeds and pesticides and
fertilizers. While the smallholders would be able to purchase the perennial
seedlings in the villages, PTP XI and PTP XIII would supply pesticides and
fertilizers for sale at the estate godown in each village. As the smallholder
would be a full-time estate employee and earn a wage, in subsequent years he
should be able to finance his pesticide and fertilizer purchase for his food
crops. The kecamatan food crop services would supply the smallholder
extension services for his food crops. The Bank assisted National Food Crops
Extension project (Loan 1267-IND) is training and stationing extension workers
throughout West Java at a ratio of one field worker (PPL) per 1,600 farmers.
4.19       In West Kalimantan PNP VII would provide each smallholder at arrival
on-site with a package of perennial seedlings, food crop seeds, pesticides and
fertilizers. In subsequent years PNP VII would supply perennial seedlings,



- 48 -
food crop seeds, pesticides and fertilizers at each of its village godowns for
sale to the smallholder. As the smallholder would cultivate about 0.3 ha of
food crops, he should be able to finance his purchases of seeds and agro-
chemicals from his estate laborer wages. As in West Java, the kecamatan food
crop services would supply extension services for food crops. The Bank-
assisted National Food Crops Extension II project (Credit 996-IND) in the near
future would upgrade food crop extension services in the project areas.
Operation and Maintenance
4.20      All primary and secondary village roads constructed by the nucleus
estates in the smallholder areas would be turned over to the provincial
governments. During project implementation the nucleus estates would maintain
them. After project completion the kabupaten public works would have this
responsibility. An assurance was obtained from GOI that all primary and
secondary village roads constructed under the project would be adequately and
timely maintained by the appropriate district agencies after project
completion. However, the estates would maintain primary and secondary estate
roads at all times.
4.21      Public buildings and community facilities constructed by the nucleus
estates for the smallholders would be turned over to the appropriate
ministries, which would then assume responsibility for their operation and
maintenance. The Ministry of Religion would supply a religious leader to the
place of worship constructed in each village.  The Ministry of Home Affairs
would appoint village officials and make the necessary arrangements for the
integration of the new villages into the existing district and provincial
governmental structure.
4.22      The nucleus estates would operate and maintain all harvest collec-
tion tracks, crop collection equipment, and processing facilities. The
smallholders would contribute 100% of their share of these costs, and the
nucleus estate, after marketing the smallholder's production, would deduct
these costs from their gross proceeds.

5. AGRICULT'URAL PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES
AND PROJECT CHARGES
Agricultural Production
5.01      The project would establish 45,780 ha of tree crops and 7,350 ha
of gardens and food crops, consisting of 8,700 ha rubber; 26,500 oil palm;
10,580 coconuts; 4,410 ha food crops; and 2,940 ha gardens. It would also
establish the supporting services for smallholder tree crop production, and
the fertilizer and agro-chemical supplies for food crops and gardens. Annex
2 gives details of crop establishment varieties, yields and production.
Table 5.1 summarizes the phasing of tree crop plantings, and Table 5.2 sum-
marizes cropping patterns yields and production.
Market Prospects
5.02      Rubber.  From 1960 to 1977, world rubber demand grew rapidly from
4.5 to 12.2 million tons (6.2% annually). While demand has slackened since
then, it is still forecast to grow 4.3% annually during the 1980s to 21.0
million tons in 1990. During the 1960s and 1970s synthetic rubber made large
inroads into natural rubber's share of the market (from 33% to 70%).
Technological advances in natural rubber production and the higher cost of
producing synthetic rubber since the 1973 oil price increases have improved
natural rubber's competitive position. Nevertheless available data on the
existing area planted with rubber, planned new planting and replanting
programs point to a decline in the rate of expansion of natural rubber output
during the 1980s. Unless investments in natural rubber production are
increased within the next few years, supply would constrain the growth in
world natural rubber consumption. All Indonesian rubber is sold on the
world market, and this would easily absorb the additional project production.
5.03      Smallholders usually sell their produce as unsmoked sheet or slab
and lump to middlemen, who then sell to processors. The price the small-
holder receives varies depending on the middleman's estimate of the dry
rubber content (drc), and usually is about 35 to 40% of the f.o.b value
of processed low grade rubber. Although quality is usually poor with slab
rubber containing much dirt and bark, the middleman's profit is usually
excessive. With improved quality and marketing conditions the smallholders
should receive higher prices than they presently obtain. The project
smallholders would be required to sell enough rubber through the nucleus
estate to meet their debt repayments. However, by reducing middlemen profits
and improving the quality of the produce, the nucleus estate would be able to
pay them about 70% of the f.o.b. processed rubber price, and this should
encourage them to sell most of their rubber through the nucleus estate. The
nucleus estates in turn would sell rubber production through the Joint
Marketing Office (JMO), an organization the public estates have established
to market their products.



- 50 -
5.04      Palm Oil.  Over the last decade, world consumption of fats and oils
has shifted away from animal fats to vegetable oils. Between 1960 and 1978
while total consumption of fats and oils grew by 3.6% annually, palm oil
consumption grew over 6.0% per annum. While overall demand for fats and oils
is inelastic, palm oil demand is elastic because it can be substituted for
other edible oils.  During 1980-90 supplies of fats and oils are projected to
grow slightly faster than demand. However, because of its lower price
relative to many other oils, over time palm oil would contribute a greater
proportion of total edible oil supplies. World palm oil production is
estimated to increase from 4.0 million tons now to 7.9 million tons in 1990,
and Indonesia's market share to increase from 16% to 23%.
5.05      Over the last five years Indonesia has exported 85% of its palm oil
production, 50% of its palm kernel production, and 70% of all palm kernel oil
processed locally. The small proportion of palm oil marketed locally has
been fractionated and sold as cooking oil. Historically, local coconut oil
has supplied the Indonesian edible oil market.  Coconut oil supplies, however,
are now 25 to 30% less than demand.  Instead of importing the more expensive
coconut oil, since 1978 GOI has diverted palm and palm kernel oil from the
export to the local market. During 1980-90, this policy is expected to divert
50% of palm oil and 100% of palm kernel production to the local market.
Smallholders would sell all their production through the nucleus estates as
only the estates would have the facilities to process the palm fruit.  Project
production from West Java would most probably all go to the local market,
while part of the West Kalimantan production would be exported. Under GOI's
present policy, however, all estate's revenues from palm oil would be pooled,
and each estate's production valued at about 50% local prices and 50% export
prices.
5.06      Coconut.  Since 1976 all Indonesian coconut oil production has been
sold locally. In 1977 domestic demand was about 990,000 tons of oil, which
during 1980-90 is expected to grow at 5% annually, while production should
increase at 2 to 5% per annum. Consequently, the shortage of local coconut
oil and copra would become more severe, and the project's incremental
production would be readily absorbed locally. Under the project small-
holders are required to sell enough copra through the nucleus estate for
their debt repayments. As in rubber processing, however, the nucleus estate
would eliminate excessive middleman profits, have the latest and most
efficient crushing mills, and thus be able to pay the smallholders a premium
above existing farm gate prices, making it attractive for them to sell most
of their production through the nucleus estates.
5.07      Food Crops.  The smallholders would produce upland rice, corn and
vegetables mainly for family consumption. Surpluses of leguminous crops
(peanuts) cloves, coffee and other garden production would be readily
saleable in market towns within and adjacent to the project areas. In West
Kalimantan, Pontianak is a large and accessible market for this produce.
The marketable surplus of these crops would be small.



- 51 -
Prices
5.08       For estate and farm budgets and economic analysis, inputs and
outputs have been valued at present and projected (1985, 1990) prices
expressed in mid-1981 constant values. Future economic prices for rubber,
palm oil, copra, coconut oil, rice, corn, peanuts and fertilizers were derived
from the Bank's Commodity Division-s forecasts for world market prices and
adjusted for transportation, processing, and handling costs down to the
farm-gate level (Annex 4, Tables 1-2). Crops not traded on the international
markets have been expressed in actual farm-gate prices averaged over three
years (1978-80) anid adjusted for inflation. Agrochemicals- economic prices
have been assumed to remain constant in real terms. Project rubber output is
assumed to be standard Indonesian Rubber (SIR) 20 which sells c.i.f.  New York
for only 5% less than ribbed smoked sheet grade 1 (RSS1). Subtracting ocean
freight and brokerage costs would give an f.o.b. price before taxes at
Indonesian ports of Rp 963/kg mid-1981, Rp 981/kg in 1985 and Rp 1,081/kg in
1990 (US$1.54, 1.57 and 1.73/kg respectively). The corresponding f.o.b.
financial prices are Rp 848, 863 and 950/kg, obtained by deducting export and
sales taxes (12% of f.o.b. price, Indonesian ports).  The nucleus estate
would pay the smallholders approximately 70% of the f.o.b. financial price
at Indonesian ports, that is, Rp 604/kg drc in 1985 and Rp 665/kg drc in 1990
(mid-1981 constant values).
5.09       Bank commodity price forecasts expect palm oil (c.i.f. Europe, in
mid-1981 constant prices) to increase from US$647/ton now to US$705/ton in
1985, then to fal:L slightly to US$681/ton in 1990, which, nevertheless,
would still be 5% greater than the present price. Allowing for ocean
freight and insurance would give f.o.b. Indonesian prices (before taxes) of
US$592, 650 and 626/ton respectively. Total GOI taxes on palm oil are about
26% of the c.i.f. Europe price, comprising a 5% export tax and a new
variable tax (PET tax) based on the margin of profitability in oil palm
production. The corresponding financial f.o.b. Indonesia palm oil prices
would then be US$424, 467 and 449/ton. Based on average production costs and
maximum producer profits of 33%, the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives fixes
the domestic palm oil price, which is currently US$385/ton. In future GOI
is expected to gradually increase the domestic palm oil price to the
equivalent export f.o.b. value. In constant 1981 values this is estimated to
be US$441 in 1985 and US$439 in 1990. Assuming the GOI would continue to
divert 50% of palm oil production to the local market, and after allowing for
local transport, port handling, processing overheads and depreciation, the
smallholders should receive a price equivalent to about 50% of the prevailing
f.o.b. palm oil value for their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) or Rp 47/kg FFB.
5.10       Before 1976 Indonesian coconut oil prices were generally comparable
to world prices aLs Indonesia was an exporter. in 1976, however, when
domestic demand exceeded local production and GOI limited imports, domestic
prices rose above; world market prices. After devaluation of the Indonesian
rupiah in November 1978, the local price declined to 31% below the world
market. By substituting other oils for coconut oil the Government has



- 52 -
continued to hold local prices below the world market. World market prices
for copra are forecast to increase from US$467/ton f.o.b. at Indonesian
ports now to US$724/ton in 1985, then fall to US$666/ton in 1990.  Farm gate
prices, which currently are around Rp 200/kg dry copra (6% moisture), are
assumed to rise to about Rp 220/kg in 1985 and stabilize around that figure.
Assuming the nucleus estates would pay a Rp 10/kg premium to the
smallholders to ensure that they sell to the estates, the smallholders would
receive Rp 230/kg in 1985 through to 1990. During harvesting periods, the
nucleus estates would pay all smallholders on a weekly basis, whether they
are producing rubber, oil palm fruit or coconuts. This would help ensure
they sell enough production through the nucleus estates to meet their debt
repayments. Weekly payments keep the smallholders better supplied with cash
than monthly payments, and reduce the likelihood they would sell their pro-
duction, even though at lower prices, through other channels to obtain a
more constant cash supply. The nucleus estates would establish committees,
including representatives of the smallholders which would meet monthly to
set prices for smallholder production. To ensure the smallholders have a
constant cash flow for their production, assurances were obtained from GOI
that (a) the nucleus estates would pay them weekly during the first three
harvesting years; and (b) the nucleus estates would establish committees,
including smallholder representatives, which would meet monthly to set
prices for smallholder production.
Farm Incomes
5.11      Future farm incomes have been calculated for the West Java settlers
assuming that each family has a 2.0 ha farm consisting of 0.2 ha garden,
0.3 ha food crops and either 1.5 ha rubber, coconuts or oil palm. In West
Kalimantan each smallholder is assumed to have a 3.0 ha farm consisting of
0.2 ha garden, 0.3 ha food crops, 2.0 ha oil palm and 0.5 ha undeveloped.
Revenues, costs and debt repayments have been calculated in constant
mid-1981 values, using projected 1985 and 1990 prices. Family labor has not
been costed. Table 6.1 summarizes the results for Sanghyang Damar, South
Banten, Cimerak and Ngabang. Except for a slightly higher net income
(higher copra yields) from year 15 onwards, Bantar Jaya and Ciemas results
are similar to Cimerak.
5.12      During the development period the smallholder is protected from
any loss or fall in income. Hlis estate wages would give him an income,
which for many, would be equal to or greater than his present earnings, and
would insure against income declines due to food crop failures. In year
seven for the rubber producers, and year six for all others, the
smallholders would be able to commence and continue their debt repayments
without difficulties. Incomes with the project would be considerably in
excess of incomes without the project, and should be a considerable
incentive for project area cultivators to join the project. In future
without the project the existing cultivator's incomes would range from US$230
(the average income for about 75-80% of the West Java smallholders) to US$610
'per annum, or from. US$46 to US$112 per capita.  Vith the project, by year lO
all families incomes before debt repayment should be at least US$1,800 or



- 53 -
US$360 per capita. As the present Indonesia average per capita GNP is about
US$405, and the estimated per capita GNP in ten years (1991) is US$600, the
project would enable beneficiaries to significantly improve their income
levels relative to other income levels throughout the economy, that is, from
11-30% to 60% of per capita GNP.
5.13      In West Java, the projected incomes for oil palm smallholders
would be less than those for the rubber or coconut smallholders (see Table
5.3). While originally GOI had planned to give oil palm smallholders 2.0 ha
of trees, the large number of existing farmers in the South Banten area
relative to the available land made this impossible. However, even with
1.5 ha these smallholders would be able to meet their debt repayments and
still have sufficient additional income compared to their present situation
to make entering the project an attractive proposition.
Cost Recovery
5.14      Smallholder Loans.  At the end of the smallholder's third year with
the project when DGA has completed its cadastral surveys and prepared the
hak milik titles for the land, the smallholders would enter into a credit
agreement with the BRI.  This agreement would include all credit expenditures
by the nucleus estates during years one to three, and provisional estimates
of the estates' "redit expenditures during year four for coconut establish-
ment, and during years four and five for rubber establishment. The agreements
for coconuts and rubber would be amended in year five and year six respec-
tively to include the estates actual credit expenditures to bring the
coconuts and rubber to maturity. The nucleus estates would keep separate
accounts of smallholder development costs, and total credit items would be
divided into staadardized credit amounts for each smallholder. The credits
between the BRI and the smallholders would be secured by land titles until
repaid. The agreements would be for 17 years, with repayments over 14 or 15
years, that is, with two years of grace for oil palm and coconut producers,
and three for rubber producers. Thus oil palm and coconut smallholders would
commence repayments in the sixth year after planting, and rubber smallholders
in the seventh. Interest would be 10.5% per annum.
5.15      Cost Recovery.  The estates, following procedures established under
the earlier NES projects, would recover the smallholder credits by retaining
the smallholders" annual credit repayment from the sales revenues of the
crops they would process and market on the smallholders' behalf. The
committees (see para. 5.10) would determine the price for the smallholder's
produce, net of itaxes, depreciation, processing and marketing costs, and
management fees. The estates would then determine the individual small-
holders total sales revenue and would deduct from it an amount sufficient to
repay the annual loan installment. Annual loan repayments would not exceed,
however, 30% of the smallholders total tree crop cash income. Should
repayments, because of low prices or production, exceed that figure, then the
excess amount would be transferred to the following year's repayment. The

estates would keep all records of raw material delivery to the factory by
smallholders, and of factory or mill output and sales revenue. They would
transfer all cost recovery to the BRI which would keep a record of all
individual smallholder accounts.
5.16      Besides repaying all credit development items, smallholders would
pay a land tax (IPEDA), which village heads would collect and turn over to
local and provincial administrations for providing public services. IPEDA can
be considered a direct project tax which contributes towards the operational
costs of the governmental agencies involved in the villages. It is assessed
as a percentage of the value of farm production and the amounts collected
would increase as crop yields rise. Annual IPEDA payments are estimated to
reach about Rp 60,000 per farm.
5.17      Rent and Cost Recovery Indices.  To determine the extent of cost
recovery and the relation of project charges to benefits, cost and rent
recovery indices have been calculated.  Cost recovery indices vary from 78%
to 89%,and rent recovery indices from 53% to 274%. These results are
satisfactory and Table 6.4 shows the rent and cost recovery indice calcu-
lations.  In calculating these indices, export and sales taxes which GOI
charges on rubber (12% of f.o.b. price, Indonesian ports), palm oil
(currently about 26% of c.i.f. price, Europe), copra (about 5% of farm gate
price) and coconut oil (currently about 26% of c.i.f. price, Europe), have
not been included in the calculations. If they were, the rent and cost
indices would considerably increase.

6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      The project would establish about 45,800 ha of tree crops, 7,350 ha
of gardens and food crops, and increase production on another 1,530 ha of food
crops. It would also upgrade a public estate. It would directly benefit
19,800 smallholder families, and provide permanent employment for another
4,200 families working for the estates. By creating potential employment
opportunities in other sectors to service the agricultural settlements, the
project would inclirectly benefit at least another 7,500 families. During the
initial development period the project would provide each of the smallholders
with a permanent job for three to five years, and, as project beneficiaries
are presently doing work of low productivity, would create at least one new
permanent job per smallholder family settled and estate laborer hired.
Although not included in the economic benefits, the project, through the
training component, would help the sector to expand in the future.  It would
also support the Government's policy of increasing tree crop exports, creating
productive employment for the rural poor, and ensuring a productive and
sustainable use of land and water resources.
6.02      The base cost of settling a family under the project would vary from
US$4,800 for a coconut smallholder at Cimerak to US$6,500 (constant mid-
1981 prices) for an oil palm smallholder at Ngabang (Annex 1, Table 7).
The higher unit costs for oil palm are mainly explained by a relative
larger investment in roads and processing facilities. The credit, or
repayable costs, are 95% of the total settlement cost. As the project would
create 24,000 new permanent jobs in agriculture (para. 6.01), for a total
investment of US$200.9 million (base cost plus physical contingencies), each
job would cost U'S$8,400. This compares favorably with job creation in medium
to large-scale industry in Indonesia at about US$20,000.
6.03      Benefits.  Expected future crop yields and production with the
project are discussed in Chapter 5 and Annex 2. Additionally Chapter 5
presents the economic and financial prices for inputs and outputs, based on
the Bank's commodity price forecasts and domestic prices. Annex 3, Tables 2
and 3 give the expected crop production costs and labor requirements per ha.
Tables showing the total expected agricultural benefits at maximum
agricultural production in the project areas are available in the project
files.
6.04      Labor Pricing.  Annex 3, Table 4 shows the monthly labor require-
ments per crop. In West Java, since the project area has excessive labor
supplies and considerable employment of low productivity, the agricultural and
unskilled laborer wage has been shadow priced. Economic wages have been
assessed at Rp 375/man day (about 50% of the market wage), the estimated
value of low productive work in the project areas, and the opportunity cost of



- 60 -
discontinuing this work.  Because of the labor shortages to undertake the
project in West Kalimantan and cost of transporting labor to the project
area, the current wages there have not been shadow priced.
6.05      Investment Costs.  As used for the economic analyses, and expressed
in mid-1981 prices, the total investment costs including physical
contingencies but excluding price contingencies are:

South Banten         22.0              Cimerak                 2.4

Ciemas                9.5              Seluma                 14.5
Cimerak               7.5
Ngabang              31.5
Investment costs are net of taxes and transfer payments, and foreign exchange
costs were converted to rupiah at Rp 625 = US$1.00, assuming a standard
conversion factor of 1.0. Investment costs have been adjusted to reflect the
economic value of fertilizers, and in West Java, the economic value of
unskilled labor used in plantation establishment.
6.06      Development Period.  Table 5.1 shows the phasing of tree crop
planting at all sites, and Annex 2 the yields and production over time.
In West Java and Bengkulu the estates would commence tree planting during the
1981-82 wet season (October-May); and at Ngabang during the 1982-83 wet
season. Smallholders would commence moving to the sites during the
project's first year, and during the second year, start growing food crops.
Smallholders would achieve the projected food crop yields over five years.
Gardens would reach maximum yields in 15 years.
6.07      Economic Rates of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions, and
discounting project costs and benefits over 30 years, the economic rates of
return are summarized as follows:



- 61 -
Smallholder      Economic rate    Nucleus estate    Economic rate
development:     of return (%)       development      of return (%)
Sanghyang Damar        15            South Banten          14
South Banten           13            Cimerak               17
Bantar Jaya            14            Ngabang               19
Ciemas                 14            Bengkuku              17
Cimerak                18
Ngabang                15
The relatively lower rates of return for South Banten compared to Ngabang are
primarily due to lower yields and higher future production from the site
without the project. The overall economic rate of return for the project is
16%.
6.08      Sensitivity Analysis.  Cost overruns, construction delays and
commodity price declines are the most likely problems the project may
encounter during implementation and operation. Table 6.1 shows the results of
testing the economic rates of returns' sensitivity to these variables.

6.09      Values shown in Table 6.3 indicate that the components' internal
rates of return are moderately sensitive to a 20% increase in projects costs
or a 20% decrease in the main commodity prices, but are only slightly
sensitive to a one year lag in the commencement of project benefits.
6.10       Crossover values at a 10% discount rate were also calculated for
the project's cost and benefit streams. The crossover value is the value of
the variable tested for which the project's net present value, calculated at
a 10% discount rate, is zero, or, equivalently, the value beyond which the
economic rate of return would be below 10%. Therefore, the greater the
difference between the crossover value and the value assumed in the analysis,
the less sensitive the economic rate of return is to.the tested variable.
Table 6.2 shows the results of these calculations.

including those for this project, after income taxes. Their earning power

projections indicate potential to share the financing of this and future
projects. At present, the estates have good financial standing, and would be
able to undertake the project. In all cases the project investments would
substantially improve the estates' asset structure and increase their earning
power and profitability.

6.12      Project Risks.  There are no unusual technical risks for the
proposed project. The proposed agricultural practices, inputs and yields are
based on experience gained in estate development programs, and the earlier NES
projects. Certalin adverse conditions for implementation have existed in
previous NES pbojects, the most critical of which has been too great a
diffusion of management responsibility between the DGE, the nucleus estate,
the project manager and provincial governments. Starting in mid-1980 these
conditions were changed by delegating increased authority to the nucleus
estate for almost all project development, and by selecting the First Director
of the estate as a project manager. Consequently project management has been
considerably improved and implementation speeded.
6.13      There is a risk that smallholders would not sell their production to
the nucleus estates, and the estates would thus be unable to collect the
smallholders' annual loan repayments. This is more likely for coconut and
rubber production rather than oil palm for which presently there are no other
processing faci]ities. However, because the estates would operate the
harvest collection services, they would be in a strong position to monitor
the flow of smallholder production and to take action if the smallholders did
not meet annual loan repayments. The smallholders, through their Credit
Agreements with the BRI, are legally bound to repay their loans through the
nucleus estates., Additionally to keep their process facilities operating at
full capacity, the estates are expected to act most competitively to obtain
the smallholders production. As well the project provides that the estates
would pay the smallholders weekly for their production. This would ensure
they have a regular cash flow, and make cash sales at lower unit prices to
middle men less attractive.



- 64 -
6.14      In Credit 319-IND and Loan 1499-IND the estates' inexperience in
building processing facilities caused delays, resulting in revenue losses from
production not processed. To counteract this, the project would provide
international consultants to plan, design, assist with tendering and supervise
the construction of all major processing facilities.
6.15      Taking the above safeguards into account, along with the results of
the sensitivity analysis, the project's indicated risks are judged acceptable.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on the
following points:
(a) (i) P'TP XI would complete its palm oil mill by January 31, 1985,
and PNP VII by January 31, 1986; and (ii) if these mills were not
in operation by these dates, GOI would adequately compensate small-
holders for any oil palm production offered for sale to PTP XI
after January 31, 1985 and PNP VII after January 31, 1986 (para.
3.12);
(b) DGE and the estates would hire consultants as outlined in
paras. 3.12 and 3.25 with qualifications and under terms and
conditions aceptable to the Bank, and would have signed contracts

October 31, 1981; and (ii) engage additional, qualified personnel
to adequately staff the LPPs at Yogjakarta and Medan by January 31,
1982 (para. 3.24);
(d) GOI would (i) group works for local competitive bidding into a
number of suitable contracts (minimum size whenever feasible
US$ 320,000) that would enable large local contractors or joint
ventures of small local firms to bid; and (ii) documents for local
contracts to cost US$ 320,000 or more would be submitted to the
Bank for review before tendering and award. Contracts below
US$ 320,000 would be awarded using GOI procurement procedures
(para. 3.38);
(e) PTPs XI, XIII, XXIII and PNP VII would: (i) keep separate accounts
for all investment costs under the project for smallholders and
estate development, (ii) these accounts would be audited each year



- 66 -
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently
applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
(iii) the audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later
than August 1st each year (paras. 3.41-3.42);
(f) The project managers, assisted by Team Khusus, would prepare and
submit to the DGE annual work programs and budgets by October 31
each year (para. 4.08);
(g) All primary and secondary village roads constructed under the
project would be adequately and timely maintained by the
appropriate district agencies after project completion
(para. 4.20); and
(h) GOI would ensure that (i) the nucleus estates would pay the
smallholder weekly during the first three harvesting years, and
(ii) the nucleus estates would establish committees including
smallholder representatives, which would meet monthly to set
prices for smallholder production (para. 5.10).
7.02      Agreement was also reached with the Government on the following
conditions of disbursement against individual project components:
(a) The signing of subsidiary loan agreements between the BI and the
individual estates in a form and substance satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 3.34); and
(b) The signing of smallholder development agreements between the DGE
and the nucleus estates (para. 4.09).
7.03      With the above assurances and conditions the project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 161 milion with a 20-year maturity including a
grace period of five years. The Borrower would be the Republic of Indonesia.

NUCLEUS ESTATES AND SMALLHOLDERS V PROJECT
Agricultural Production
1.        The project would establish 45,780 ha of tree crops and 7,350 ha
of gardens and food crops, consisting of 8,700 ha rubber, 26,500 ha oil
palm, 10,580 ha coconuts, 4,410 ha foodcrops, and 2,940 ha house gardens.
It would also establish the supporting services for smallholder tree crop
production, and the fertilizer and agrochemical supplies for food crops and
gardens. The following paragraphs discuss the details of establishment,
varieties, cropping patterns, yields and productions.
Rubber
2.        The rubber planting program of PTP XI and PTP XXIII for each site
is shown in Table 1 below. Planting would start in 1981.

3.        Nurseries - Planting Material.  Nurseries would be established on
a flat area, near a reliable water supply, and served by an all-weather
road. Nursery density would be 40,000 plants per ha and would provide
32,000 stumps for planting (80% of initial density). Budwood gardens would
be established in Seluma. For Sanghyang Damar, PTP XI would utilize their
existing budwood gardens. Budwood garden density would be 10,000 plants per
ha. Clones used should come from the Rubber Research Institutes either in
Medan and Bogor or the Rubber Research Centers in North Sumatra and Central
Java. In Sanghyang Damar, where plantings are for smallholders only, clones
to be selected would be GTI (40%), PR 300 (15%), PR 303 (15%), PPN 2444
(15%) and PPN 2058 (15%). In Seluma, plantings concern only estate develop-
ment. Clones such as AV 2037, PR 255, GYT 577, RRIM 600 should also be
considered on a small-scale. Sprinkler systems would be provided for the
aurseries in Saaghyang Damar.

4.         Field Planting.  The vegetation on the two sites consists of
secondary jung'Le and alang-alang. All land clearing would be done manually
using chainsawS and chemicals as described in para. 3.07. After land
clearing, a legume cover crop (LCC) consisting of a mixture of Calopogonium
Muconoides and Centrosema Plumeri (8 kgs/ha each) would be established
before planting. This legume mixture would be shifted to Calopogonium
Caeruleum if it becomes available. In this event, 2 kgs would be sufficient
to cover one ha. Fertilizers (rock phosphate, TSP and Urea) would be
applied to the cover crop to promote its growth. Planting density would be
500 trees per ha using a spacing of 8 x 2.5 m or 7 x 2.85 m depending on the
growth characteristics of the clone.  The estates would have to terrace 40%
of the area planted in Sanghyang Damar and 50% in Seluma. In Sanghyang
Damar the estates would plant using two to three whorl budded stumps in
polybags. Dead plants estimated at 5%, or 25 plants/ha would be replaced
three months after planting. In Seluma, plantings would use budded stumps.
Dead plants estimated at 10% or 50 plants per ha would be replaced using two
to three whorl budded stumps in polybags. Replacement has been estimated at
10%, that is, 50 plants per ha. Since the project sites would require
fertilizers to achieve expected growth and yields. Staff working papers
contain the estimated fertilizer schedules. These schedules are only a
standard for cost and budget purposes, and should be revised based on actual
soil and leaf analyses by the Rubber Research Centers.
5.         Upkeep/Weeding.  To keep development costs low, manual weeding
operations would be replaced by chemical weeding starting in the second
semester of year 2. Noxious weeds would always be kept under control and
soft grasses would be acceptable up to 50% during the immature period.
6.        Yields and Production.  Estimated yields are detailed in Table 6.
Average yields over 25 years of tapping are 1,210 kgs/ha for smallholders in
Sanghyang Damar and 1,705 kgs/ha for the estate development in Seluma. The
peak yields would be in the twelfth year of exploitation (17 years after
planting) and would reach 1,620 kgs/ha for the smallholder and 2,350 kg/ha
for the estate. At full maturity, the peak annual production would be
16,687 tons: 5,683 tons, 11,004 tons for Sanghyang Damar and Seluma respec-
tively (Table 7).
7.        Harvesting.  The nucleus estate would train smallholders for tapping
operations and would organize collection in each village unit. The nucleus
estate would sLIpervise tapping. Smallholders would be divided into groups
of twenty and each group would elect a leader. Modern tapping systems with
the emphasis on low tapping frequency combined with stimulants would be
introduced to optimize productivity per tapping and bark conservation.
Oil Palm
8.         PTP XI and PNP VII would plant oil palm at South Banten (4,000 ha
nucleus estate,, 8,000 ha smallholders) and Ngabang (3,500 ha nucleus estate,
11,000 ha smal:Lholders). Phasing of the planting program is shown in Table
2 below.  Planting would start in 1981 in South Banten and 1982 in Ngabang.

9.        Nurseries.  The estates would locate nurseries as suggested for
rubber.      The planting material used would be high-yielding Dura x
Pisifera germinated seed produced by the PNP/PTP-owned Marihat Research
station (MRS) in North Sumatra. The planting material requirements assume
200 germinated seeds for 130 plants per ha planting density. Seeds would be
sent from MRS immediately when the sprouts appear to prevent root damage
during transportation. A sprinkler watering system would be installed and
the area fenced prior to nursery start-up. Polybag spacing in the main
nursery would be a 70 x 70 cm triangular system, providing 14,000 plants per
ha, sufficient in transplanting 80 ha. Before transplantation the estate
would strictly cull plants and would only use plants of vigorous growth and
normal aspect.
10.       Field Planting.  Land clearing would be done manually and noxious
weeds eradicated by chemicals. The LCC would be established after land
clearing by using the same techniques as described for rubber. Planting
density would be 130 plants per ha, using a spacing of 9.4 x 9.4 m
(triangular system). This density is lower than the present standard of 143
plants because MRS now recommends it to avoid leaf competition for the new
varieties. Planting would be done using 8 to 10 month old plants in
polybags. Since project area soils have a low nutrient level, fertilizers
would be necessary to promote growth and yields. The staff working papers
provide estimated fertilizer schedules for budget purposes. MRS should
revise these on results of soil and leaf analyses. Noxious weeds, such as
Imperata cylindrica, Eupatorium and Mikania would be controlled.  Soft
grasses, up to 50%, would be acceptable in order to reduce weeding costs.

11.       Yields and Production.  Assisted pollination would be necessary
during the first four years in production. The estate would train the
smallholders int this critical operation. Test plots without assisted
pollination would be established to confirm desirability of this operation.
Estimated yields and extraction rates in project areas are given in Table
8.  In South Banten, due to unfavorable climatic conditions the peak yields
have been estimated at 19 tons FFB per ha for the nucleus estate and 16 tons
for the smallholder. In Ngabang, yields would reach 22 tons FFB per ha for
the nucleus estate and 20 tons for the smallholders. In South Banten
production would start in year 4, that is, about 36 to 38 months after
planting, whereas for Ngabang production would start in the second semester
of year 3 that is 30 to 32 months after planting. Table 3 shows full
maturity oil and kernel production by site.

12.       Harvesting.  The nucleus estate would train smallholders in bunch
harvesting and would organize collection procedures for each village unit.
Each village unit would be divided into six groups for weekly harvesting.
One day of the week would be assigned to each group. On the assigned day,
each smallholder would harvest his own 2.0 ha. Simultaneously, the nucleus
estate would keep a strict control of bunch quality on the basis of ripeness
and the collection cf loose fruit.  To ensure a low free fatty acid (ffa)
content for palm oil, its rapid transport to the proposed mill would be
required. To ersure this, trucks would be loaded using a net system. Each
smallholder would stack his FFB on his own net. Trucks would be fitted
with hydraulic crarLn to lift the nets. The crane would also contain a
weighing cell  hor          production of each smallholder.  -The weight
would then be              the truck driver and smallholders would be given
a collection, :2zc'   rc. :ymen£ for their FFB.

14.       Planting Material.  The Dwarf x Tall hybrid recommended for
planting come:: from crossing the Malaysian (or Nias) Yellow Dwarf and the
West African Tall.  Under good management this hybrid has the following
characteristits:
(a) precocity: flowering starts in the third or fourth year after
planting;
(b)  hi h nut count:  120 to 160 nuts per palm per year;
(c) good copra content: copra weight is about 230 grams per nut; and
(d)  high yields:  4 to 5 tons of copra per ha (in the Ivory Coast,
hybrids have reached an average of 5.6 tons per ha per year for
the last seven years).
Coconut hybrid seeds are now produced in PTP VI and PTP XI seed gardens.
15.       Nurseries.  Nurseries would be located as suggested to rubber and
palm oil.  One ha would accomodate about 16,000 seedlings in polybags for an
output of 13,000 plants after selection, that is, a field planting capacity
of 85 ha.  Strict selection would be carried out in the germination
bed before transplantation in polybags.  Dwarf off-types would be
discarded. Selection of germinated nuts would be based on the germination
speed on a standard of 65% germination within an overall time limit of 14
weeks from soiwing. Remaining nuts after this stage would be discarded.
Germinated seed would be planted in heavy gauge polybags. Spacing of
polybags would be an 80 x 80 cm triangular system providing a density of
16,000 plants per ha. Regular daily watering would be required during the
dry season to maintain soils in a thoroughly wet condition without
becoming waterlogged. Fertilizers would be applied to plants in polybags.
Staff working papers indicate application rates. Culling would start four
months after planting in polybags at monthly intervals. Seedlings showing
abnormalities would be discarded.
16.       FieLd Planting.  Land clearing would be done manually and the LCC
would be estalblished just after land clearing. The planting density would
be 143 plants per ha using a spacing of 9 x 9 m triangular system. Normally
eight to ten month old plants in polybags would be used for planting.  When
planting on a slope from 8-20%, individual terraces would be established and
on over 20% siLope, contour terraces would be used. In the latter case,
hedges of woody legumes (Flemingia, Mogania, Crotalaria) would be
established in between rows. Hybrid planting material requires good field
management in weeding, pest and disease control and manuring. Schedules of
fertilizer applications are provided in the staff working paper. Fields
should be kept free of noxious weeds (Imperata cylindrica, Eupatorium,
Mikania) and soft grasses would be acceptable up to 50%. Estimated yields
are given in Table 10.  Yield projections take into consideration the soil

and climatic condition for each location. At full maturity the production
will reach 42,410 tons: 11,600 tons of copra in Bantar Jaya, 15,960 tons in
Ciemas and 14,850 tons in Cimerak (Table 11).
Food Crops
17.       Existing Settlers.  The existing farmers' crops and cropping
patterns at the West Java and West Kalimantan sites are described in Chapter
2. The Ngabang farmers are basically shifting cultivators, returning to an
area about every ten years, while the farmers at the West Java sites, except
for their sawah, crop an area once every two or three years. At all sites
crop yields are low, averaging in West Java for paddy sawah 1.7 ton/ha,
paddy upland 0.7 ton/ha, corn 0.4 ton/ha, cassava 6.0 ton/ha and peanuts 0.5
ton/ha and at Ngabang for paddy 0.5 ton/ha, corn 0.2 ton/ha and cassava 4.0
ton/ha. Without the project these yields are expected to at best remain
unchanged as the farmers would not have access to inputs.
18.       Future Production.  The project would provide each family moved
into a project village with 0.5 ha of cleared land for a house garden (0.2
ha) and food crops (0.3 ha). At all sites at the beginning of the wet
season, the farmers would interplant upland rice and corn over all
the food crop area (0.3 ha). After harvesting the rice and corn, farmers
would immediately plant about 67% of the area with a high value leguminous
crop such as peanuts. With farmers using fertilizers, pesticides and good
husbandry practices the yields with the project would be, for paddy 1.6
ton/ha Ngabang, 1.7 ton/ha West Java, corn 0.8 ton/ha and peanuts 0.9
ton/ha. Farmers would plant their house gardens with a variety of fruit
(papaya, citius, rambutan), cash crop trees (coconut, clove, coffee) and
vegetables.
Processing Facilities
19.       Processing facilities for the project would provide as discussed
in Chapter 3.
Start-Up Activities
20.       In connection with the next Nucleus Estate and Smallholder project
in Seram (Maluku province), PNP XXVIII would establish: a rubber budwood
garden, nurseries for rubber and coconut, and land clearing for planting in
1982 of 400 ha of rubber and 250 ha of hybrid coconut. PTP XXVIII would
also establish the main roads in the project site and start construction of
the base camp.
