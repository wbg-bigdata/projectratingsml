TUNISIA
THIRD URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
General
1.01     Tunisia is located on the southern bank of the Mediterranean sea
about midway between Gibraltar and Suez. It occupies an area of 160,000 km2
which is rather poorly endowed with natural resources. The great Atlas moun-
tain chain, which runs from west to east about 280 kms south of the northern
coastline, separates the country into two distinct regions. North of the
Atlas mountain chain is a semi-arid area where the majority of the population
lives and where most potentially irrigable land is found. Industries and
other economic activities are concentrated in the northern coastal areas. The
mean annual rainfall in this region fluctuates around   600 mim.  South of the
Atlas mountain chain lies arid land with an average annual rainfall of less
than 100 mm (Map IBRD No. 16721).
1.02     Administratively, Tunisia is divided into 20 governorates, 136
counties and 162 communes. Nearly half of the estimated total population of
6.4 million, which is growing at an average annual rate of 2.2%, is considered
urban. More than one-third of the urban population is concentrated in Tunis
and Sfax, the two largest metropolitan areas. The rural population, however,
is widely dispersed into more than 3,500 locations often isolated from each
other and where low population density to a great extent impedes rapid imple-
mentation of water supply and sanitation systems.
Water Resources.
1.03     The volume of water available in Tunisia for urban, industrial and
agricultural use is limited. At present, about 58% of the total exploitable
water resources is under exploitation, and by the year 2000, more than 90%
will be utilized. Urban and agricultural water demand could soon exceed
available regional water resources. This is already occurring in the southern
part of the country which draws part of its supply from the north. Ulti-
mately, it will become necessary to resort to desalination of brackish or sea
water to supplement potable water resources and to treated wastewater for
industrial and agricultural purposes.
Sector Organization
1.04     The Ministry of Agriculture manages all water resources in the
country. "La Société Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux"
(SONEDE), an autonomous public enterprise established in 1968 under the



tutelage of the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for the production and
distribution of potable water in all agglomerations above 500 inhabitants.
"L'Office National d'Assainissement" (ONAS), also an autonomous public enter-
prise established in 1974 under the tutelage of the Ministry of Equipment, is
responsible for sewage collection, treatment and disposal, the reuse of
treated sewage and storm drainage in urban agglomerations and industrial and
touristic zones. "La Direction du Génie Rural" (DGR), a department in the
Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for water supply and sanitation in the
rural areas not covered by SONEDE and ONAS. The municipalities are respon-
sible for solid waste collection and disposal.
Water Supply and Sanitation
1.05     Since its creation, SONEDE has grown into a technically capable and
financially viable company with an experienced and dedicated staff. Presently
about 64% of the total population has access to a safe piped water supply.
This includes about 97% of the urban population of which about 80% is supplied
through private house connections.
1.06     In villages with less than 500 inhabitants, only about 25% of the
population has access to a safe public water supply and of these, about one in
five through private house connections. Public water supply systems are
normally limited to wells and boreholes and in the larger villages to an over-
head reservoir connected to a number of public fountains. DGR's activity is
limited to the construction and sanitation of wells, the installation of hand
pumps and the construction of simple water supply sytems. In concordance with
its policy to improve living conditions in the rural areas, however, the
Government intends to substantially increase rural water supply services.
1.07     Virtually no public sewerage exists in rural villages.  Most of the
houses provided with private water connections possess individual waste water
disposal systems (seepage pits).
Solid Waste
1.08     The Government intends to improve solid waste collection and dis-
posal, and to this effect has entrusted ONAS with the responsibility for
carrying out, with the assistance of consultants, a study on the collection
and disposal of solid waste in the Greater Tunis area. This study, for which
financing is foreseen in the Urban II Bank project, would make recommendations
on how to improve garbage collection and disposal, including the establishment
of municipally-owned autonomous public enterprises.
Urban Sewerage
1.09     Under the First Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1088-TUN), and with Bank
assistance, the Government created ONAS in 1974, in order to have an institu-
tion able to efficiently manage the country's urban sewerage subsector and to
plan and implement future expansions. ONAS started its operations in July



1975 by taking over the sewer systems of Greater Tunis (13 municipalities),
Sfax and Sousse, and is now in the Drocess of taking over the sewer systems of
agglomerations with over 10,000 inhabitants. To date ONAS has assumed respon-
sibility for sewerage and sewage disposal in 26 municipalities and 6 touristic
zones and is planning to take over 54 additional systems over the next 6 years
(Annex 1).
State of Repair of Sewer Systems
1.10     The sewer systems which ONAS acquired are often in a serious state of
disrepair. A lack of preventive maintenance has often resulted in sewers
being obstructed, which causes overflow of sewage in high housing density
areas with consequent health hazards, or in the case of storm sewers, flooding
of low lying areas when severe storms occur. Furthermore, where they exist,
these sewer systems are not serving the entire urbanized area as their devel-
opment has lagged behind urbanization. These sewer systems require a consi-
derable amount of rehabilitation and it will take some time before ONAS can
extend them to catch up with the existing service backlog.
Sector Objectives
1.11     The sewerage subsector's main objective set by the National Commis-
sion for Sewerage (NCS) consists of bringing sewerage services to a level
comparable to that of potable water supply. This objective is to be achieved
through the rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion of existing sewer systems,
the provision of flood control and drainage and the development of treatment
and disposal facilities in order to safeguard the environment and abate health
hazards. NCS had proposed house connection rates of 60% by 1986 and 81% by
1990 for urban areas. However, because of financial constraints, ONAS had to
considerably reduce its planned investments for the Sixth Plan period (1982-
86) (para. 1.15) with the result that it will not be able to assume responsi-
bility for as many centers as had been envisaged and the 1986 target will not
be achieved. Overall, the 1986 connection rate for all urban areas is not
expected to rise significantly above the present level of 42%.  However, in
the towns where ONAS will take over sewerage by 1984, the proposed 1986 target
of 60% should be achieved.
1.12     Another important subsector objective consists of promoting the reuse
of treated sewage for industrial or agricultural use in order to supplement
the country's scarce water resources (para. 1.03)
1.13     Government priority is now to keep the momentum of development of
sewerage systems in the urban areas within ONAS' purview, to extend progres-
sively ONAS' services to all other urban centers and to increase service
levels through house connections by encouraging the population to connect to
the rehabilitated or the new sewer systems by providing credit facilities to
cover connection costs.
Individual Sanitation Systems
1.14     In order to keep ONAS' immense task within reasonable limits, and to
reduce public investments, the Government is promoting the use of individual



sewage disposal systems whenever approriate (seepage pits or septic tanks with
leaching fields for the fringe of urban areas and pit latrines for dwellings
not connected to a public water supply system). In the small towns and rural
villages where the population density is low and soil conditions are appro-
priate, individual systems are satisfactory. This approach should enable ONAS
to concentrate on the large and more densely populated agglomerations where
individual sewage disposal systems are no longer appropriate or are more
costly than sewers (para 2.05 through 2.08).
ONAS' Sixth Development Plan (1982-1986)
1.15     Using sound technical and economic studies, ONAS has prepared a Five-
Year Development Plan (1982-1986) detailing the investments necessary to
achieve the objectives mentioned in para. 1.11. Because of budgetary con-
straints and after discussions among ONAS, the Ministry of Equipment, the
Ministry of Finance and Planning and the Bank, the original plan was reduced
from an original TD 210.0 million to TD 120.0 million (in current value).
This was achieved by rescheduling some investments of lower priority. The
reduced plan for 1982-1986 (the Sixth Plan) has the same magnitude as the
Fifth Plan in real terms and represents an increase of 50% in nominal terms.
The sewerage projects included in the Sixth Development Plan are listed in
Annex 2 and may be divided into two categories:
A. Ongoing Major Projects (TD 57.0 million)
This category includes the major projects which were started during the
Fifth Development Plan (1977-1981):
(i)  the First Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1088-TUN), for the Greater
Tunis area, completed;
(ii)  the SIDA Project, also nearing completion and including the construc-
tion of treatment plants in Sfax and Kairouan, and sewer systems in
Gabès and Kelibia;
(iii)  the 17 cities Project, receiving financial assistance from EEC,
covers seventeen medium-sized towns:
(a)   already taken over by ONAS:
Sousse, Monastir, Kairouan, Gabes, Nabeul, Hammamet, Le Kef,
Hamma (Gabès), Hammam Sousse; and
(b)   to be taken over by ONAS in 1983:
Gafsa, Tozeur, Kasserine, Moknine, Menzel Bourguiba, Kalaa
Kebira, Jemmel, Akouda;
(iv) the Second Urban Sewerage Project (Bank Loan 1675-TUN), currently in
progress, for Greater Tunis and Sfax; and



- 5 -
(v) studies, rehabilitation and upgrading of existing facilities, as well
as acquisition of operating equipment and erection of offices and
workshops for ONAS.
B. New Major Projects
This category includes new projects to be implemented during the Sixth (1982-
86) and Seventh (1987-91) Development Plans:
(i) the proposed Third Urban Sewerage Project, described in more detail
in Chapter III and covering a phased program for thirty towns to be
taken over by ONAS during 1983-1988. Total cost TD 49.5 million;
(ii) the Medjerdah Basin Project, designed to protect the Sidi Salem dam
reservoir from urban and industrial pollution.  It includes eleven
cities: Ghardimaou, Jendouba, Bou Salem, Beja, Teboursouk, Gaafour,
Djedaida, Siliana, Tebourba, Testour, Medjez El Bab. Total cost
TD 26.0 million, receiving financial assistance from the Federal
Republic of Germany (Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau; DM 27 million);
(iii) the Greater Tunis Project, which covers the expansion of the sewerage
and stormwater systems. Total cost TD 35.0 million, 50% of which
financed by the Kuwait Fund;
(iv) a new project expected to start hefore the end of the Sixth Plan for
the expansion of the existing sewerage system of Sfax. Total cost TD
19.0 million;
(v) three sewage treatment plants to be built for Mahdia, Gabès and
Kasserine.  Total cost TD 8.3 million; and
(vi) eight sewage treatment plants to be expanded. Total cost TD 4.7 mil-
lion.
Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.16     The Bank's strategy is to assist the Government to attain its service
level objectives for the water supply and sewerage sector and to step up
public enterprise savings through further improvements in management effi-
ciency and tariff policy. The Bank has helped to establish and develop SONEDE
and ONAS and bas maintained a continuous and close dialogue with the Tunisian
Government on sector policies and operating practices through a series of
operations. In the water supply subsector, the Bank Group has made five loans
and one credit totalling US$ 124.5 million and is preparing a rural water
supply project throughout Tunisia.  In addition, the Bank is preparing a flood
protection project for Sfax. In the early years, following the establishment
of SONEDE and ONAS, projects suffered substantial delays, but these diminished
as the institutions matured and gained experience. The sewerage subsector
received three loans and one credit from the Bank Group:
(i)    the Tourism Infrastructure Project (Loan 858-TUN for US$ 14.0 million
and Credit 329-TUN for US$ 10.0 million, both of September 28, 1972)
included US$ 16.64 million for sewerage in six tourist zones. The



-6-
project was revised as the result of changes in the Government's
tourism development objectives in 1975, and suffered further delays
due to related changes needed in the detailed design and additional
time needed to complete detailed land-use plans and acquire land.
The revised project was completed in 1981;
(ii)    the First Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1088-TUN of February 18, 1975
for US$ 28.0 million).  The main objectives of this project were to
support the establishment of ONAS as an effective operating agency,
to clean up Lake Tunis by building a canal along its shores and to
improve the sewerage facilities of the Greater Tunis area.  This pro-
ject which is now completed has had a major environmental impact
because cf the depollution of Lake Tunis and the suppression of
sewage olfactive nuisances. As a consequence, the land value around
the Lake has increased about twentyfold and a government agency
(Société d'Aménagement des Berges du Lac) has been recently estab-
lished to develop the lake shores; and
(iii)   the Second Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1675-TUN of April 13, 1979
for US$ 26.5 million). This project is part of ONAS' Fifth Develop-
ment Plan (1977-81) to develop the sewerage sector through improve-
ment and extension of waste water collection, treatment and disposal
facilities and stormwater systems in the Greater Tunis and Greater
Sfax areas. Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily,
although three stormwater collectors need to be retendered as bids
were considerably higher than anticipated and additional local funds
have to be allocated. The Government is studying appropriate
measures to provide these funds and complete the project expediously.
In addition, three urban projects contain sewerage components. Urban I (Loan
937-TUN, Credit 432-TUN of October 5, 1973 for US$ 18 million), which is now
completed, contained several sewerage studies. Urban II (Loan 1705-TUN of May
31, 1979 for US$ 19 million) includes US$ 3.9 million for the improvement and
expansion of water supply and sewerage systems in several low income settle-
ments. This project also contains a solid waste component including a study
which is now being executed by ONAS. Urban III (2223-TUN of January 11,
1983), loan of US$ 25 million, includes US$ 2.7 million for the upgrading and
expansion of water supply and sewerage systems in low income settlements.
1.17     The Project Performance Audit Reports on the first two water supply
projects (PPAR No. 1902 of February 13, 1978) and of the third water supply
project (PPAR 3914 of May 4, 1982) concluded that these projects had met their
objective of providing water of acceptable quality for the increasing require-
ments of the population in the areas served, and contributed greatly towards
the development of SONEDE into a technically sound and financially viable
institution. The audit for the third water supply project concluded that more
detailed engineering should have been carried out prior to Board presentation.
Accordingly subsequent projects have been appraised on the basis of well
advanced final designs. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) has also
published a Sector Operations Review on the Water Supply and Waste Disposal
Program in Tunisia (Report 4146 of October 20, 1982) which states that there
have been few examples of the Bank's involvement in the Water Supply and Waste
Disposal Sector as successful as the Tunisian experience. The reasons for the
success are stated to be the Government's commitment to its sector policy
objectives, and the harmony of the Bank's program with these objectives.



Il. POPULATION, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT AREA
Population
2.01     The latest census, held in May 1975, reported a total Tunisian popu-
lation of 5.6 million. A recent survey carried out by the National Institute
of Statistics (NIS) estimated that, as of July 1980, the population was about
6.4 million of which about 52% or 3.3 million lived in urban areas l/.
Average annual population growth rates are projected at 2.2% per annum during
the 1980s and 2.0% thereafter. On this basis, total population is expected to
reach 7.7 million by 1990 and 9.1 million by 2000. The urban segment of the
population however would grow at about 3.3% per annum, a substantial part of
this growth stemming from rural migration to urban areas. Rapid urbanization
is expected to continue with the dispersed rural population accounting for
less than 20% of the total population by the end of this century.
2.02     Of the 3.3 million urban dwellers, about 45% or 1,500,000 people live
in large cities (District of Tunis, Bizerte, Sousse and Sfax), 30% or
1,000,000 persons in towns of over 10,000 inhabitants, and the remaining 25% or
800,000 people in small towns of from 2,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. About 12%
of the total urban population, or 400,000 persons, have an income below the
Bank estimated urban absolute poverty threshold2/ of TD 140 (US$ 250) per
capita per year. The proportion of urban poor is higher in the small and
medium-sized towns (15% or 270,000 people) than in the large towns (8% or
130,000 people). It is therefore appropriate that, after improving the sewer-
age systems of Greater Tunis and Sfax, ONAS devote its attention to medium-
sized towns, which is the object of the proposed project.
Service Levels
2.03     The sewerage subsector is characterized by various levels of service.
In small urban centers and in the fringe of large urban areas, where it is
common for dwellers to hand-carry water from public water hydrants, latrines
and open ditches for sullage water prevail. Where the water supply service
has been upgraded to individual house connections, low volume cistern-flush
toilets and on-site seepage pits have been installed. However, because of
insufficient seepage pit design capacity or poor soil permeability, overflows
occur frequently, inducing householders to by-pass their seepage pits and to
discharge their sullage water directly into the street. Finally, where high
housing density exists, mostly in the towns' center, individual sanitation
systems have been converted into limited communal sewered systems. Today, the
overall sewerage house connection rate for all urban communities is about
40%. Poor operation and maintenance, lack of financial resources, and in-
adequate sewage disposal still persist in the centers for which ONAS has not
yet assumed responsibility. By contrast, in ONAS operated centers the quality
1/ For this purpose urban areas were defined as towns with over 2,000 inhabi-
tants.
2/ The absolute poverty threshold is the level below which a minimum adequate
nutritional diet plus essential non-food requirements are not affordable.



-8-
and level of service have improved dramatically. In the 26 municipalities
taken over so far by ONAS the average sewerage connection rate is about 63%
and exceeds 70% in the large urban centers.
Project Area
2.04     In 1977, ONAS hired consultants (Netherlands Consulting Engineers) to
carry out a general study of the sewerage subsector to draw up a national pro-
gram of works and establish rehabilitation and expansion priorities among 162
urban centers. Four main selection criteria were employed: (i) the existence
of a sewerage master plan and/or urban development plan which could speed up
project preparation; (ii) the proportion of dwellings served by water supply
systems but not connected to sewerage facilities; (iii) the percentage of
dwellings discharging sullage water into open ditches; and (iv) the potential
for reuse of treated water for agricultural or industrial purposes. As a
result of these studies, a first project, comprising a phased program of
sewerage development in 17 top priority towns, has been launched with partial
financing from EEC. ONAS' estimate of the cost of this project is TD 20.4
million (US$ 32.4 million). A second program is under preparation for 11
cities in the Medjerdah Basin. Its total estimated cost is TD 26.0 million.
The Federal Republic of Germany (Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau) is providing
financing for an amount of DM 17 million. A third project, involving 30 urban
centers and 34 municipalities, has been proposed for Bank financing. This
project is located in six zones in different parts of the country. (Map no:
16721). The 1981 combined population of these 30 urban centers was about
555,000, i.e. about 8.5% of Tunisia's total population, and is projected to
grow to 655,000 hy 1986 and 1.2 million hy 2006. The 1981 average connection
rates of these 30 centers were 82% for water and 42% for sewerage. The pro-
posed project should help to increase the average sewerage connection rate to
about 60% by the end of 1987 and above all to substantially upgrade existing
sanitation facilities.
Existing Sewerage Facilities
2.05     Existing sanitation facilities in the proposed project area are
generally poor. The 30 towns selected may be grouped as follows:
(i)   5 towns are equipped with individual sanitation facilities;
(ii)   16 towns have a combination of individual sanitation facilities and
communal sewerage systems; and
(iii)   9 towns have communal sewerage systems.
2.06     The first group of towns is completely deprived of collective sewer-
age systems. Soak-aways, and in some instances septic tanks, for one or two
households are used (Sheitla, Ksour Essaf, Mahares). These have usually been
installed by the owners themselves. Proper operation and efficiency of these
facilities has been hampered by one or a combination of the following condi-
tions:



- 9 -
(i)   insufficient soil permeability and underdesign of the facilities
(Mahares) which cause overflow of the effluents directly into the
streets or open drainage ditches. In these instances the soak-aways
or septic tanks function as holding tanks which have to be emptied
several times a year at a cost of between TD 3 to TD 10 (US$ 5 to
US$ 15) each time they are emptied;
(ii)   proximity of river beds or sea shore (Medenine, Mahares) where swel-
lings and high tides reverse the water flow into the soak-aways, thus
preventing subsurface infiltration of effluents;
(iii)   insufficient distance from nearby groundwater used for drinking which
causes contamination and consequential health hazards (Medenine and
Sbeitla);
(iv)   high urban density (Ksour Essaf) which results in insufficient capa-
city of the soil to absorb the effluents; and
(v)   virtual lack of stormdrainage systems and exposure almost every year
to important flooding.
2.07     In the second group of towns where individual sanitation facilities
are combined with a sewer system which usually serves the center of the town,
sanitary conditions are generally inadequate. The major problems of this
group are:
(i)   insufficience or even sometimes inversion of the slopes of the sewer
pipes which hampers or prevents the self cleaning velocity of efflu-
ents and causes obstructions and extra maintenance;
(ii)   poor quality of sewer pipes and fittings which results in leakages
and potential contamination of the underground water;
(iii)   environmental hazard which is created by the discharge of large
volumes of wastewater in the dry river beds running through these
towns; and
(iv)   lack of facilities to reuse water in areas where water resources are
limited.
2.08     In the third group of towns where the service level is above 70%,
municipal departments have been responsible for operation and maintenance of
their sewerage facilities. The lack of managerial and technical skills, the
shortage of materials and equipment to operate, maintain and replace sewers,
and the absence of a cost recovery policy are responsible for the rapid
deterioration of the systems. Repair and rehabilitation of existing facili-
ties rather than network expansions are the first order of priority. Further-
more, in order to remove the increasing environmental hazards arising from the
growing population, effluents have to be taken outside the town limits where
they can be treated for reuse by industry and agriculture.



- 10 -
2.09     Of the thirty towns included in the proposed project, only one, Dar
Chaabane, operates a sewage treatment plant. The treatment plants of Zaghouan
and Grombalia are out of service. The demand for treated wastewater exists in
towns such as El Djem where farmers have diverted the flow of raw sewage which
is used without appropriate treatment and control for the irrigation of vege-
tables and garden crops. The present practice represents a serious health
hazard which would be corrected by the construction of adequate treatment
facilities under the proposed project.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01     The proposed project is the result of a continuing dialogue between
the Bank, the Government and ONAS on the development of the sewerage subsector
and on ways to finance ONAS' investment plans. It was prepared by the Govern-
ment, with the assistance of consultants, under the Second Urban Sewerage Pro-
ject (Loan 1675-TUN). Its main objectives are:
(i) to improve urban sanitation through the rehabilitation of existing
sewer systems, and to abate pollution through proper discharge of
effluents;
(ii) to expand sewer systems where individual sanitation facilities
present serious health hazards, and to encourage the population to
connect to the new sewers;
(iii) to provide stormwater drainage;
(iv) to treat sewage for reuse by industry and agriculture in the frame-
work of a national water resources management policy, and to elimi-
nate irrigation of garden crops with raw sewage;
(v) to support the Government's efforts to develop in the medium to long-
term a technically capable and financially self-supporting sewerage
sector; and
(vi) to assist ONAS in:
(a)   securing its financial position by supporting the adoption of a
new long-term financial policy which would allow ONAS to
finance at least 13% of its investments during the project
implementation period (1983-1989);
(b)   gradually taking over the responsibility for sewerage, sewage
treatment and disposal in all urban centers with a population
above 10,000 inhabitants; and
(c)   improving its operating capability by acquiring the necessary
maintenance and data processing equipment and office accommoda-
tions.
Project Scope
3.02     The proposed project covers the rehabilitation and expansion of
existing sewer and stormwater systems, and the provision of sewage treatment
facilities in the following centers (Map IBRD No. 16721):



- 12 -
(i) North:         Bizerte, Ras Jebel and Mateur;
(ii) Cap Bon:       Menzel Temime, Soliman, Menzel Bou Zelfa, Beni Khalled,
Grombalia, Korba, Dar Chaabane and Zaghouan;
(iii) Sahel;         Kalaa Sghira, Sahline, M'Saken, Ouardanine, Sayada-
Lamta-Bou Hajar, Ksar Hellal, Teboulba, Bekalta and
Ksour Essaf;
(iv) Sfax region;  El Djem, Sfax suburbs and Mahares;
(v) Interior:      Sbeitla, Sidi Bouzid and Nefta; and
(vi) South;         Houmt Souk, Zarzis, Medenine and Tataouine.
Project Description
3.03     The proposed project is detailed in Annex 5.  It includes:
(i)  the construction of about 110 km of primary sewers together with
about 20 sewage pumping stations and other related structures;
(ii) the construction of about 300 km of secondary sewers;
(iii) the construction of about 25 km of stormwater sewers;
(iv) the construction of about 12 sewage treatment plants, the expansion
of one existing treatment plant and the connection of five towns to
existing treatment plants;
(v)  the provision of maintenance and data processing equipment and office
accommodation;
(vi) the provision of consulting services for related designs and super-
vision of construction; and
(vii)  studies:
(a) feasibility studies for 10 to 15 new centers to be taken over by
ONAS, and for the promotion of the reuse of treated sewage for
industrial and agricultural purposes. (Terms of Reference, Annex
3); and
(b) computer and information system study (Terms of Reference, Annex
4).
Cost Estimate
3.04     The estimated cost of the proposed project appears in Annex 5 and is
summarized in the table below. It amounts to TD 49.44 million (US$ 78.48 mil-
lion) including a foreign exchange component of TD 21.42 million (US$ 34.0



- 13 -
million), or 43% of the total cost. Identifiable taxes and duties amount to
about 21% of the total cost.

for pipes, pumps, treatment equipment and civil works procured under the on-
going sewerage projects in Tunisia, particularly the project financed by EEC
which is very similar to the proposed project. All costs have been adjusted
to January 1983 levels. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% for
sewers and 15% for treatment plants. These percentages are justified in view
of the considerable knowledge and experience gained in similar towns in the
two first Urban Sewerage Projects and in the ongoing EEC project. Price con-
tingencies of 9% for 1983 and 8% per year thereafter for both local and
foreign components have been included in the cost estimates for equipment and
civil works based on ONAS' recent experience with Tunisian and international
prices for sewerage equipment and works.
3.06     The project provides for an estimated 750 man-months of local consul-
ting services for the preparation of the detailed engineering and bid docu-
ments for the sewerage systems and for works supervision, and 130 man-months
of foreign consultants for the final designs and works supervision of treat-
ment plants and the feasibility and computer studies. The estimated cost of
these services (including international travel and subsistence) is TD 2.36
million (US$ 3.74 million) or an average of US$ 3,500 per man-month for local
consultants and US$ 8,500 for foreign consultants.
Investments per Capita
3.07     The investments for the secondary sewer systems amount to TD 10.41
million in January 1983 prices, of which about 30% is attributable to the
rehabilitation of the existing sewer systems. At the end of the project
period when about 155,000 additional inhabitants would be served by new
sewers, the capacity utilization rate would reach only about 75%. This means
that the investment cost per capita at that date would be about TD 35 (US$
56). Furthermore, as the new sewers would evacuate both sanitary sewage and
stormwater in the proportion of about 50:50 of annual volumes, the cost per
capita for the sanitary evacuation of sewage alone would be about TD 17.50
(US$ 28) per capita.
3.08     A similar calculation for primary sewers for which the capacity
utilization rate at the end of the project period would only be about 50%,
results in a per capita cost of TD 18.0 (US$ 29).  Following the same metho-
dology for treatment plants, a per capita cost of TD 36.0 (US$ 57) is ob-
tained.  The resulting total costs per capita would thus amount to TD 71.5
(US$ 114) for sanitary sewage, and TD 46 (US$ 74) for stormwater drainage.
These costs are very reasonable.

ONAS' proposed self-financing for the project would amount to about 16%
through internal cash generation (8%) and customers' contributions (8%). The
Government would provide the balance of the local financing requirements of
US$ 31.7 million (41%) and the proposed Bank loan of US$ 34.0 million would
finance the foreign exchange financing requirements, including US$ 253,102 for
the front-end fee which the Government has requested the Bank to finance.
3.10     The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government which would
on-lend it to ONAS at the same terms and conditions including the variable
interest rate, the front-end fee and the commitment charges. ONAS would also
bear the foreign exchange risk. Domestic long-term commercial Bank lending
rates in Tunisia currently range from 5.25% to 11.5%. Inflation in the past
three years has averaged 8.9% as indicated by the cost of living index and the
forecast for the next two years is 9%. In these circumstances, on-lending at
terms similar to those of the Bank seems adequate. Execution of a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government and ONAS under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan.

Implementation
3.11     It is estimated that the proposed project would be completed in six
years as shown in the implementation schedule in Annex 6. The proposed works
would be implemented under the responsibility and supervision of ONAS with the
assistance of consultants retained in accordance with Bank guidelines. Con-
sultants' contracts for the preparation of tender documents have been divided
into four contracts for sewer systems and two for treatment plants. The same
consultants will be retained for supervision of their part of the project.
The first bids are scheduled to be invited in the spring of 1983 and construc-
tion could start in the fall of 1983 and would be completed by the end of
1988. Estimated annual project investments are shown in Annex 7.
Procurement
3.12     Major civil works, pipe laying and equipment supply contracts esti-
mated at US$ 40 million will be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. In
order to encourage international competition, contracts will be grouped as far
as practicable, particularly according to geographical location. ONAS will
acquire the asbestos-cement and concrete pipes and accessories through ICB in
three installments, each for one third of total requirements, and make the
pipes and accessories available to the pipe laying contractors. Treatment
plants will also be grouped and procured through ICB with one contract per
group for civil works and one for equipment supply and installation. For bid
evaluation purposes a 15% margin of preference or an amount equal to customs
duties, whichever is lower, would be applied in the case of equipment manufac-
tured in Tunisia. Small contracts for equipment and works, which are not
expected to attract international competition will be procured through local
competitive bidding (LCB), in accordance with ONAS' procedures which are
satisfactory. For this type of contract, individual ceilings of US$ 800,000
per civil works contract and US$ 200,000 per equipment contract, and aggregate
ceilings of US$ 4 million and US$ 1 million, respectively would be retained.
Work by force account, after Bank approval, is allowed up to a maximum value
of US$ 1.5 million for works in isolated areas where no contractor would be
interested to carry out works at a reasonable price. Small works related to
connections to, or deviations or protection of, telephone, gas, water, elec-
tricity, lighting and transport services and lines, estimated at US$ 200,000,
will be executed by the Post, Telephone and Telegraphic Authority (PTT), the
Electricity and Gas Authority (STEG), the Water Authority (SONEDE), the Rail-
roads Authority (SNCFT) and the Ministry of Equipment for the account of ONAS,
according to local procurement procedures for public contracts which are
acceptable to the Bank. Consultants would be engaged in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants by World Bank Borrowers. All ICB
bid documents, amounting to about 80% of the total contracted value, would be
reviewed by the Bank on a priorto-award basis.
3.13     Foreign contractors are expected to win the contracts for the supply
of pipe accessories, maintenance and treatment equipment. Because the local
contracting industry is reasonably developed, local contractors, either alone
or in partnership with foreign firms, are expected to win most of the con-
tracts for pipe supply, pipe laying and civil works.

3.16     Disbursements for works carried out by force account would be made
against certificates of expenditure. The supporting documentation would not
be submitted for review but would be retained by ONAS and made available for
inspection by Bank supervision missions. ONAS has the administrative and
accounting capability to prepare and maintain the necessary records and, fur-
thermore, these statements of expenditure would be audited annually. All
other expenditures would be fully documented.
3.17     Disbursement profiles show that disbursements for the sector in the
EMENA region have extended over an eight-year period, while the disbursements
for Tunisia have extended over seven and a half years. Taking into account
that ONAS' implementing capacity has improved and that the final designs are
well advanced, it is anticipated that disbursements would start immediately
after the loan would become effective and that the proposed project could be
completed and fully disbursed within a six and a half year period.

Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing
3.18     Some of the bid documents are expected to be completed and reviewed
by the Bank before the signing of the proposed loan and, in order to speed up
the realization of the project, advance contracting for these components in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines is appropriate. Expenditure for these
components is not expected to be incurred before the signing of the proposed
loan agreement. Final studies of the sewerage systems including topographical
and geotechnical studies and the preparation of bid documents in the 30 towns
are being carried out by qualified consultants under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. In order to contribute to a speedy and effective exe-
cution of the project, retroactive financing for the work performed by these
consultants starting November 1, 1982 and up to an amount of US$ 300,000 is
recommended.
Monitoring System
3.19     Proposed key indicators for monitoring the technical and financial
performance of the project are shown in Annex 8. During negotiations, these
key indicators and the project implementation schedule (Annex 6) have been
discussed and agreed upon with ONAS. These would serve as targets ONAS would
strive to achieve. The project implementation schedule was also discussed and
agreed upon. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that ONAS will
report quarterly on all aspects of project work including the key indicators.
Furthermore, ONAS will comment on any deviations from agreed targets and will
as necessary take prompt remedial action in consultation with the Bank.
3.20     During negotiations, assurances have also been obtained that within
six months following the closing date of the proposed loan ONAS will prepare
and submit to the Bank a project completion report reviewing the planned
objectives and the achievements of the project, including the costs and bene-
fits derived and the performance and contribution of all parties associated
with project execution and systems operation.

IV. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
4.01     The beneficiary of the proposed loan would be ONAS, the national
sewerage authority, which was established in 1974 (para 1.04). ONAS has the
status of an industrial and commercial public company with financial
autonomy. ONAS has been the beneficiary of previous Bank Group lending in the
sector channeled through the Government (Loan 1088-TUN and Loan 1675-TUN).
Organization and Management
4.02     The actual organizational structure of ONAS is shown in Annex 9.  The
Board of Directors, presided by ONAS' General Manager, supervises the com-
pany's activities and is composed of fifteen members. Nine board members are
public officials and represent Ministries and other public agencies involved
in the water and sewerage sector. The remaining six Board members represent
the municipalities and ONAS' customers. The overall control exercised over
ONAS by the Government, aside from the appointment of its Board members,
covers mainly the approval of ONAS' investment programs, borrowings and tariff
levels.
4.03     The present General Manager, who, as usual, was appointed by the
Minister of Equipment, has extensive experience and is well qualified to run
ONAS. The day-to-day operations are handled by two departments for New Works
(one for Greater Tunis and one for the rest of the country), one department
for Planning and Studies and one for Operation and Maintenance and two divi-
sions, one for Finance and one for Administration. Two service units in
charge of internal audit, organization, management and resource control assist
the General Manager in formulating long-term plans and policies.
4.04     Under existing agreements from a previous Bank loan (1675-TUN) in
June 1980, ONAS retained the services of a consultant to coordinate the plan-
ning and design of its works program and to develop and institute a project
planning and control system. The consultant completed his assignment in June
1982 after having trained the personnel of the newly created Coordination and
Planning Unit. Responsibility for this Unit was then given to the Director of
Planning and Studies.
4.05     In June 1980 ONAS hired a management consulting firm (SOTINFOR) to
upgrade its financial, administrative and management reporting systems. New
cost control procedures are presently under implementation and computerization
of ONAS' cost accounting system is expected to be operational by mid 1983
(para. 4.10).
4.06     ONAS' present capacity for implementation, operation and maintenance
is adequate. However, some modifications, such as the provision of central-
ized office accommodation to replace and expand the current inefficient dis-
persed offices is required, especially in view of ONAS' future growth. Appro-
priate accommodation with standards acceptable to the Bank is included under



- 21 -
the proposed project. In addition, the creation cf additional regional divi-
sions to its existing structure are required. These divisions will be insti-
tuted progressively as the need arises. Existing agreements under Loan 1675-
TUN, which commit ONAS to consult with the Bank before making any changes in
its organization and administrative structure, would be maintained.
Personnel and Training
4.07     At the end of 1981, ONAS' permanent staff totalled 1,455, which is
equivalent to 9.46 employees per thousand house connections. This ratio is
acceptable for ONAS' decentralized type of organization. ONAS' future growth
will require an additional 1,280 employees by the end of 1990 when it will
have to service about 195,500 additional customers. Between now and 1990,
ONAS intends to improve its staff productivity and to reduce the number of
employees per 1,000 connections to about 7.6. ONAS' salary structure and
benefits are adequate to recruit and retain qualified personnel.
4.08     A comprehensive training strategy bas been developed by the Staff
Training division of ONAS ("Commission de la formation et du perfectionnement
professionnel") with the assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany (GTZ)
and EEC training experts. The current staff training program is considered
adequate. During 1977-1981, 479 employees participated in short-term training
seminars covering various aspects of ONAS' operations. In addition, nineteen
overseas scholarships were granted to ONAS' engineers for training in sanitary
engineering and other fields related to sewerage operations. Operators for
the new sewage treatment plants will receive additional training from the
equipment manufacturer who will be responsible for the first year operation of
the plants. ONAS, with the help of SOTINFOR, is also giving attention to
training its staff in budget planning and cost accounting. ONAS is consider-
ing creating its own training center and discussions to this effect have
started with the EEC for financial and technical assistance.
Billing and Collection
4.09      Sewerage charges are based on water consumption, and billing and col-
lection is carried out jointly by SONEDE, the National Water Authority. ONAS'
customers are billed on a rotating basis every three months for the water sur-
charge and the maintenance fee.  Collection by SONEDE is generally efficient,
although, in the past, delays have occurred in the transfers to ONAS. Ini
October 1982, however, SONEDE agreed to settle the existing transfer backlog
in two steps, about 50% by December 31, 1982 and the remainder by March 31,
1983. It is understood that, starting with FY 83, SONEDE will transfer the
amounts collected for ONAS within one month. As of December 31, 1981,
accounts receivable from private consumers amounted to about 85 days of
billing, while those from government agencies amounted to 99 days of billing.
Accounting
4.10      ONAS operates a commercial accounting system based on the Tunisian
General Accounting Plan. All transactions are recorded properly and allow



- 22 -
identification of expenditures by major cost categories. However, the present
system does not permit the monitoring of the cost effectiveness of each
regional center and activity. Therefore in December 1980, ONAS revised with
the assistance of SOTINFOR its accounting and internal control procedures. A
new computer-based accounting system is now under implementation and is expec-
ted to be operational by mid 1983. The system is set up to provide detailed
cost information for each branch office, regional office and project.
4.11     ONAS' general accounts, inventory control and payroll are now proces-
sed on a computer on a time sharing basis with its consulting firm (SOTINFOR)
for a monthly fee of TD 250/month. The programs library, however, is develop-
ed and maintained by ONAS' programmers who benefit from their association with
SOTINFOR. ONAS has thus been able to develop its own computing capability
without having to devote immediately sizeable resources to purchase, operate
and maintain its own computer equipment. Nevertheless, with its increasing
responsibilities and expected growth, ONAS contemplates acquiring its own
equipment as soon as its staff has gained sufficient expertise in computer
operations. It is therefore necessary for ONAS to study how its information
and management control system should be modified to meet its requirements.
Such a study (Terms of Reference, Annex 4) would:
(i) identify and define ONAS' present and future needs in financial,
technical and statistical data reporting;
(ii) develop a detailed information network for all of ONAS' departments,
regional and branch offices, and assess staffing needs;
(iii)  propose the most efficient and economic solution for ONAS' data pro-
cessing equipment (sub-contracting, leasing or purchasing);
(iv)  adapt, if necessary, with appropriate modifications the existing pro-
grams library; and
(v) propose assistance in implementing the new procedures.
The Terms of Reference for this study have been agreed with ONAS during nego-
tiations.
Auditing
4.12     ONAS' operations are monitored by a Technical Controller and a Finan-
cial Controller who are appointed by the Government, and who are advisory mem-
bers of the Board of Directors. In addition, an external audit of ONAS'
financial statements is carried out each year by independent private auditors
who are acceptable to the Bank. Recent audit reports have been comprehensive
and valuable to the development of the institution, although they were
received with slight delays. The existing audit covenant (Second Urban Sewer-
age Project, Loan 1675-TUN) which calls for ONAS to have its accounts and
financial statements for each fiscal year audited, in accordance with appro-
priate auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and to furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but
in any case not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, the



- 23 -
certified audit report, is being maintained in the present loan, as was agreed
during negotiations. Annual audits would include the review of statements of
expenditures (para. 3.16).
Insurance
4.13     ONAS carries adequate insurance to cover the risks of a public
utility. The policies are with different Tunisian insurance companies and
relate to motor vehicles operation, fire damages to buildings, and third party
liability. ONAS is self-insured for workman's compensation and maintains a
special insurance fund for this purpose. All supply and civil works contracts
for the project will be insured by private companies against loss and damage
in shipment, accidents, and fire and property damages.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past and Present Financial Performance
5.01     ONAS' income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets for
the years 1978 through 1982 are shown in Annexes 10, 11 and 12.
5.02     In the period of 1978-1982, ONAS met all its financial covenants
under the First and Second Urban Sewerage Projects (Loans 1088 and 1675-TUN).
In that period its operating ratio increased from 66% to 76%. This decline in
profitability was due to rapidly rising operating costs and deferral of tariff
adjustments until early 1982. Nonetheless, ONAS financed about 35% of its
investments out of internal cash generation, the remainder having been pro-
vided by Government capital contributions (25%) and long-term borrowings
(40%). Throughout the 1978-1982 period, ONAS' debt service coverage was at
least 1.7 and at the end of 1982, its debt to equity ratio stood at 34:66.
Revenues
5.03     ONAS' cost recovery policy is aimed at preserving its short and long-
term financial viability while, in the case of domestic customers, ensuring
affordability for the less affluent and creating incentive for minimizing the
flow of used water through scaled tariffs and, in the case of industrial cus-
tomers, charging higher rates for higher levels of pollution of industrial
effluents based on the BOD -  values of the waste water.  ONAS' revenues are
expected to continue to cover its operating expenses and debt service as well
as a portion of its ongoing investment costs. However, because in Tunisia the
same tariff schedule applies to all centers regardless of size, the takeover
by ONAS of increasingly small centers with higher attendant cost per unit
together with the progressive phasing out of one of its revenue components
(para. 5.05) are expected to reduce the proportion of ONAS' contribution to
investments from its net cash generation below the 35% ratio achieved
previously (para. 5.11).
5.04     ONAS' revenues come essentially from:
(i) sewerage charges and connection maintenance fees;
(ii) municipal levies;
1/ Biochemical Oxygen Demand.



- 25 -
(iii) compensatory revenues;
(iv) connections and other works; and
(v) sale of by-products and services.
5.05     ONAS' sewerage charges and connection maintenance fees are based on
water consumption and cover waste water operating and maintenance costs and
part of those for stormdrainage and treatment. In 1982, these charges gene-
rated 38% of the total revenues. A contribution of 8% of the "Fonds Commun
des Collectivités locales," provided by the yield of municipal property taxes,
covers the remaining costs for stormdrainage and treatment services and repre-
sented 23% of ONAS' 1982 total revenues. In addition, compensatory revenues
(about 40 millimes per m3 of water supplied in areas served by ONAS) estab-
lished in consultation with the Bank in the context of the First Urban Sewer-
age Project (Loan 1088-TUN) are designed to recover a portion of the benefits
of cleaning up Lake Tunis and particularly the increase in the value of land
and properties surrounding the lake. Due to the increasing number of connec-
tions, these revenues which in 1978 accounted for about 50% of ONAS's reve-
nues, amounted to only about 34% in 1982. In view of the increasing population
which is connecting to the sewerage system of Greater Tunis, the Government
has asked ONAS to program a progressive phasing out of these revenues.
Finally, miscellaneous revenues arise from the sale of by-products (treated
water for irrigation and sludge), from services such as cleaning and repair of
house connections and from interest earned on credit facilities offered to
customers. These accounted for about 5% of total revenues in 1982. It is
expected that between 1982 and 1987, revenues from sewerage charges and con-
nection fees would increase almost 8.5% per year in real terms while the
recovery of increases in land and property value would be phased out. By
1987, the makeup of revenues would be 71% from sewerage surcharge and connec-
tion fees, 19% from property taxes, and 10% from miscellaneous revenues.
During negotiations the Government confîrmed its intention of progressively
eliminating compensatory payments to ONAS by the end of 1986.
5.06     ONAS' non-operating revenues consist of the recovery of connection
costs from new customers plus a property assessment towards the capital cost
of secondary sewers. Since June 1980, ONAS extends credit to its customers
for the payment of the connection costs and the property area assessment.
Principal and interest are repaid over a five year period with installments
added to customers' quarterly sewerage invoices. Consumers are charged inte-
rest on these credits at the current interest rate of local banks plus 0.5%;
effective January 1982, this rate was 11% per annum and is expected to
increase to 12% in 1983.
Tariffs
5.07     ONAS' sewerage tariffs are based on a surcharge on the potable water
consumption and a fixed fee for the maintenance of the sewer connection.
These tariffs increased substantially during 1982, as shown in the table below.

5.08     As a result of the 1982 tariff increases, ONAS' average revenues
increased by about 118% in current terms, or 98% in real terms.  The increase
affects mainly industrial and high domestic consumption. Between 1982 and
1989, ONAS is expected to further increase its tariffs at an average of about
8.5% per year in real terms.  Average revenues from tariffs would amount to
TD 0.205 per m3 in 1989, i.e. about TD 0.128 per m3 in 1982 prices.  Total
average revenues would grow about 6% per year and would reach TD 0.280 per
m3 in 1989, i.e. about TD 0.162 per nJ in 1982 prices.  ONAS' tariff
structure and levels bave been planned in such a way as to meet its cost reco-
very objectives (para. 5.03).
Financial Policy and Objectives
5.09     Under the First and Second Urban Sewerage Projects (1088-TUN and
1675-TUN) ONAS was required to undertake periodic reviews of its revenue
structure and to adjust its tariffs so as to ensure the continuing rapid
development of the sector. Concurrent with the preparation of its investment
plan for 1982-86, ONAS undertook a complete review of its financial policies
and objectives. A new financial policy, consistent with the Government policy
and objectives for the sector, was introduced, whereby ONAS is required to
finance out of internal sources at least 13% of its capital expenditures.
Current projections show that ONAS' revenues will be sufficient to cover its
operating and maintenance costs and its debt service, and to finance a per-
centage of its capital requirem.!nts that will fluctuate between 13% and 22%
during the 1983-1989 period. lhe new policy also foresees that ONAS' compen-
satory revenues (para. 5.05) would be reduced gradually and disappear by the
end of the Sixth Development Plan (1986).

5.11     During the project implementation period the combination of net
internal cash generation and property assessments would provide about 19% of
total financing requirements, Government equity contributions 34%, existing
loans 12%, the proposed Bank loan 9%, and other long-term borrowings for the
latter part of the period 26%. This financing plan supports the Government
and ONAS' cost recovery objectives (para 5.09), which are based essentially on
generating sufficient cash to cover at least 13% of average annual investments
in spite of the continuing additional burden for ONAS of taking over responsi-
bility for increasingly small centers. A cash flow approach is readily under-
stood in Tunisia and is working very well in the water sector.  The existing
covenantl/ would therefore be replaced by a conventional cash flow covenant
as outlined in paragraph 5.12.
1/ This covenant required ONAS to generate funds sufficient to cover its
operating expenses, debt service and working capital requirement plus at
least 4% of its net fixed assets including work in progress.



- 28 -
5.12     Agreement has been reached during negotiations that ONAS will take
and the Government will support all such measures, including adjustments to
its tariffs, as may be required, for each of its fiscal years after its fiscal
year ending on December 31, 1982, to provide funds from internal sources and
customer contributions equivalent to at least 13% of the annual average of its
capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, during that year
and the following year. Furthermore, before November 30 of each of its fiscal
years, ONAS will, on the basis of forecasts satisfactory to the Bank, review
the required level of compensatory revenues, tariffs and property area assess-
ment for the current and the following year and provide the Bank with a copy
of such review report and the proposed adjustments.
5.13     To ascertain the continuing development and the improvement of the
self-financing of the sector during the Seventh Development period (1987-
1991), ONAS will undertake a comprehensive review of its financial objectives
during the preparation of its investment plan (1987-1991). This would facili-
tate the Government's review and endorsement of timely tariff actions and,
hence, ensure ONAS' financial viability.
Future Financial Performance
5.14     Forecast financial statements appear in Annexes 10, 11 and 12.
Financial assumptions are presented in Annex 16. A tentative Seventh Invest-
ment Plan (1987-1991) discussed with ONAS assumes investments on the order of
TD 220.0 million, in current value, which represent a 15% increase in constant
value over ONAS Sixth Investment Plan (1982-86). This objective is realistic
and aims at maintaining the service level in the large urban areas and at
improving the level in medium-size towns.
5.15     From now up to the end of the project implementation period (1989),
ONAS' revenues are expected to grow about 2.9 times from TD 13.65 million to
TD 39.56 million while its operating expenses before depreciation would grow
about 2.8 times from TD 6.74 million to TD 18.93 million, leaving gross mar-
gins sufficient to cover all of its projected debt service and a share of its
investment costs. Its operating ratio would gravitate around 80. In the same
period ONAS' total fixed assets would grow from TD 96.74 million to TD 292.07
million, i.e. about three times. Its debt to equity ratio would stay around
40;60 while its debt service coverage ratio would not drop below 1.3.
5.16     During negotiations agreement has been reached that ONAS will not
incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures
shows that its projected internal cash generation for each fiscal year during
the term of the debt to be incurred would be at least 1.3 times its projected
debt service in such year on all its debt including the debt to be incurred.

VI. JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
6.01     The project components stem from the recommendations of the Master
Plans prepared between 1975 and 1980 for a phased development of sewerage in
the thirty towns included in the proposed project. The sewage treatment
plants and pumping stations would be constructed in phases representing the
least cost alternative. Alternative treatment processes considered for least
cost comparison purposes include extended aeration, activated sludge, biologi-
cal filters and discs, aerated lagoons and waste stabilization ponds. Sewers
will be built to their ultimate capacity as this is the least cost solution.
Institution Building
6.02     Although ONAS has already proven to be an efficient organization, it
would be further strengthened by the proposed project. In particular, its
financial capability would be enhanced by the introduction of medium and long-
term financial policies and objectives aimed at generating sufficient cash to
finance a portion of its investments. This approach, which is better under-
stood by Government than the former rate of return objective, will result in
more frequent tariff adjustments to satisfy the new objectives. The proposed
project will also assist ONAS to carry out its expansion program and strength-
en its operation and maintenance capability.
Health Benefits and Environmental Impact
6.03     Sanitary conditions in the towns served by the proposed project will
greatly improve as a result of the proposed project. Present health hazards
caused by the discharge of effluents inside the town limits, by overflows from
cesspools or even by the discharge of effluents directly into open ditches
along the streets, will be eliminated. This will lessen the greatest sources
of contamination and infection. Removal of effluents from the soil will also
remove the threat of contamination of lower aquifers which are found below
many of these towns and are used for human consumption. The treatment of
sewage will provide safer water for irrigation and eliminate the dangerous
habit of irrigating vegetable gardens with raw sewage.
Beneficiaries
6.04     The proposed project will benefit the present and future population
of thirty towns, although at different levels. The rehabilitation of the
existing sewers will provide a better service to the presently connected
250,000 inhabitants who will in addition benefit from the expected eradication
of health hazards prevalent in the high density housing areas. The 1983-1988
expansion program will give 155,000 inhabitants access to community sewerage
systems. The highest benefits in terms of health, living conditions and



- 30 -
decrease of costs of sewage disposal are anticipated for this segment of the
population (see para 2.06). Finally the treatment and reuse of the effluents
of an estimated one million inhabitants living in the proposed project area by
the year 2000, will have a major environmental and economic impact. The
direct beneficiaries of the proposed project, about 40% of which are estimated
to be at or below the current poverty threshold of TD 140 per year, will be
offered service at affordable cost.
Affordability
6.05     The average water consumption of the low income group is 18 m3/
quarter (Annex 14) and therefore subject only to a fixed quarterly maintenance
fee of TD 0.750. In addition, the cost of.a house connection which on average
amounts to TD 70 is recovered from consumers in 20 quarterly installments,
including principal and interest, which results in a quarterly payment of TD
4.705. The total monthly payment for sewerage is thus TD 1.818, or about 2%
of the revenue of those living on the minimum wage of TD 89 per month. This
is considered affordable. Future tariff adjustments will not change this
picture as no increases in real terms are expected for low income consumers.
The combined monthly payment for water and sewerage is likewise estimated at
about TD 2.800 or 3% of the minimum wage which is also considered affordable.
Cost Recovery
6.06     The long-run incremental cost of providing sewerage service net of
proceeds from the sale of treated sewage is estimated at TD 0.121/m3 (TD
0.133/m3 less TD 0.012/m3) in 1982 prices, at a 10% discount rate-/.  It
is also estimated that by 1987, when compensatory revenues will have been
phased out, the highest tariff step for domestic and public sewerage service
will reach TD 0.122/m3 (in 1982 prices), and that all tariff steps for
industrial and tourist service will be higher. The fact that these tariff
steps would at least equal the long-run incremental cost of providing a
sewerage service indicates that the tariff structure and levels would be
appropriate.
6.07     This analysis furthermore indicates that if revenues derived from
sewerage tariffs are taken as a proxy for benefits, the rate of return for
ONAS' investment program is higher than 10%, since this approach does not con-
sider benefits associated with improved health of the population served,
improved environment and increases in land value which are difficult to
quantify.
Risks and Safeguards
6.08     The main risk confronting the project is that of slippage in the
construction program, and the consequent escalation of costs. However ONAS'
performance in implementing works has improved during the First and Second
Urban Sewerage Projects. In addition further improvement is expected in the
1/ A 10% discount rate is considered appropriate for Tunisia.



- 31 -
future and the risks of not achieving the objectives of the project are low.
ONAS has the required implementing capability, as demonstrated by the imple-
mentation of the Fifth Development Plan (1977-81). Furthermore, the measures
recommended in this report, such as (i) the assistance by consultants for pro-
ject preparation, construction and supervision; (ii) experts to assist in the
development and implementation of appropriate computer and information control
systems; (iii) Bank's assistance in reviewing organization changes; (iv)
Bank's monitoring of key performance indicators for ONAS and providing neces-
sary guidance during supervision, should help to minimize the project risks.
The risk of not achieving the forecast increase in the number of house connec-
tions is small as households having a water connection are eager to connect to
the sewer systems, particularly as connection fees can now be paid in install-
ments. The risks that the sewage treatment plants will not be operated
properly is also small, as ONAS is constantly training new staff which will be
given additional training by the equipment suppliers. Existing treatment
plants are well run.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements have been reached on the following
items:
(i) the terms of reference for the feasibility study for 10 to 15 new
centers and for the reuse of treated sewage for industrial and agri-
cultural purposes and the computer and information systems study
included in the project as described in Annexes 3 and 4. (para. 3.03);
(ii) the number and type of monitoring indicators to be included in the
quarterly progress reports. (para. 3.19);
(iii) the project implementation schedule (para. 3.19);
(iv) the preparation of a completion report (para. 3.20);
(v) the submission by ONAS of audit reports within six months after the
close of each fiscal year. (4.12).
(vi) the measures to be taken by ONAS and to be supported by the Govern-
ment, including adjustments to its tariffs, as may be required, for
each of its fiscal years after its fiscal year ending on December 31,
1982, to provide funds from internal sources and customers' contribu-
tions equivalent to at least 13% of the annual average of its capital
expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, during that year
and the following year (para. 5.12);
(vii)  before November 30 of each fiscal year, starting in 1983, on the
basis of forecasts satisfactory to the Bank, the review by ONAS of
the required level of compensatory revenues, tariffs and property
area assessment in order to adjust them to meet its cash flow
requirements and provision to the Bank of a copy of such review
report and the proposed adjustments (para. 5.12); and
(viii)  the fact that ONAS should not incur any debt unless a reasonable
forecast of its revenues and expenditures shows that its projected
internal cash generation for each fiscal year during the term of the
debt to be incurred would be at least 1.3 times its projected debt
service in such year on all its debt including the debt to be
incurred (para. 5.15).
7.02      The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and ONAS on the same terms as the Bank loan would be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para. 3.10).
7.03      Agreement having been reached on the above, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 34.0 million to the Government of Tunisia for
a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.

THIRD URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
FEASIBILITY STUDY
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1. Introduction
The national sewerage authority, the "Office National d'Assainisse-
ment" (ONAS) established in 1974, is responsible for the planning, operation,
maintenance, renewal and construction of all sewerage works located within the
limits of the urban areas and within touristic and industrial development
zones. In 1989, ONAS will have taken over the responsibility for operating
the sewerage systems of 80 municipalities with a global population of 3.5 mil-
lion inhabitants, 46% of the total Tunisian population. In these towns the
connection level to the sewer system will be about 60%. The Government of
Tunisia has requested a loan from the World Bank to assist in the financing of
the upgrading and expansion of sewerage systems in about 30 medium-sized
towns. Part of the proceeds of this loan will be used to assist in the
financing of this study.
2. Objectives
The objectives of the study are:
1.   after an analysis of the present situation, to assess future demand
and define a long-term investment program up the year 2010;
2.   to prepare feasibility studies for sewerage projects in new urban
centers to be taken over by ONAS as first priority; and
3.   to propose actions to promote the reuse of treated sewage for indus-
trial and agricultural purposes.
3. Execution of the Study
Part I of the study consists of the critical examination of ali
exîsting sector-related data and studies relevant to the agglomerations with a
population above 2000 at the time of the 1975 census. Touristic areas and
industrial zones are to be included, but the Greater Tunis and Greater Sfax
areas are to be excluded. This basic information has to be updated and com-
pleted as required.
After having analyzed the existing situation and future demands has
been assessed, a phased investment program has to be elaborated to meet this
demand. Criteria to define priorities have to be established in consultation



- 36 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
with ONAS, and should include inter-alia health aspects, flood protection,
touristic or industrial developments, water supply situation, potential reuse
of treated sewage, under or over-utilization of existing installations,
ground-water contamination, the protection of the environnent and economic
return on investments.
Part II of the study, should only be started after Part I has been
cleared by ONAS. It consists of the feasibility studies for 10 to 15 new
urban centers to be taken over by ONAS and for which the priority has been
established in Part I of the study. The exact number and names of the centers
will be determined by ONAS after Part I of the study has been completed. The
feasibility studies should result in a phased development plan per center. An
economic justification has to be prepared for the recommended technical solu-
tion and the phasing. Cost estimates, in particular, for the first phase have
to be in constant prices and reasonably accurate.
Part III of the study can be considered as a marketing study and
should start at the same time as Part I. First, the existing situation should
be described and analyzed and future demand assessed. Constraints to a speedy
development of the demand should be identified and solutions proposed. A
range of actions has to be proposed. The actions proposed should aim at the
promotion of the sales of treated water for agricultural and industrial pur-
poses. An economic analysis has to be carried out to see if tertiary treat-
ment is justified. The actions to be considered to promote reuse of treated
sewage should include an information campaign for the local rural and
industrial communities.
4. Time Allowance and Reports
The time allowed for Part I of the study is 9 months after which a
draft report has to be submitted to ONAS. ONAS is expected to give its com-
ments and clearance to start with Part Il of the study within 3 months. Part
II should be completed in 9 months afterwhich another 3 months are allowed for
ONAS' comments and clearance. Finally, 2 more months are allowed for the
preparation of the final reports. The time allowed for submission of the
studies in Part III is 9 months after which comments and clearance from ONAS
will be given within 3 months and 2 more months are allowed for the prepara-
tion of the final reports.
All draft reports have to be submitted in 5 copies and final reports
in 20 copies except for the feasibility studies of which 10 copies are re-
quired.

Background
The "Office Naticnal de l'Assainissement,` (ONAS) is in charge of
sewerage services in 26 large urban centers in Tunisia. ONAS is an institu-
tion owned by the Governmenlt of Tunisia and managed alorig the lines of a
public agency by a general manager and supervised by a Board of Directors.
ONAS is in the process of 13radually taking over up to 1988, 54 additional
municipal sewerage systems,, which are, or are about to be rehabilitated and
expanded. All works are to be executed by local and international contrac-
tors. ONAS' organizationa]. structure is presently characterized by;
(i)   a centralized aLdministrative system covering personnel manage-
ment, accountirtg, supply and resources management and monitoring;
and
(ii)   a customer management subcontracted to SONEDE, the National Water
Supply publi,c us:ility, in charge of m,eter reading, billing and
collection.
ONAS does not have^  a computer of its own.  Manual or subcontracted
computerized procedures hav e been adopted for invenl:ory control and valuation,
payroll and pensions, gener. al accounting, cost accoiinting, and technical and
statistical calculations.
Objectives of the Study
ONAS intends to in rite consultants for a stucly to examine the oppor-
tunity of acquiring its own data processing Qquipmen2t aind propose the neces-
sary modifications of its il iformation and management control system. This
study will be partly financid by the World Bank in th,e framework of the Third
Urban Sewerage Project.
Basic Documentation
The study will, as appropriate, refer to e:isting documents available
at ONAS and in particular;

(v)   proposals to adapt, if necessary, witl\ a7?propriate modifications
the existing programs library; and
(vi)   proposals of assistance for the implem>.ntation of the new system.
Planning of the Study
The study will be (:arried out in two phaseie and a draft report will
be submitted for review by ONAS at the end of each 1? hase, before the final
report is issued.
PHASE I.
This phase will avialyze the present situat i on and the future require-
ments of ONAS' flows of ini'ormation.
PHASE II
This phase will co-ver the study of differer t: alternatives for equip-
ment, an economic analysis oE the proposed solution,  eventually the prepara-
tion of bid documents and proposals to assist ir. the  implementation of the new
system.

THIRD URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS
REVENUES
Sewerage Charges
Sewerage charges have been calculated on the basis of projected water
consumption of ONAS' customers, taking into account population growth, the
rate of connections and consumera' categories. In the 1983-1990 period, ONAS
is planning to do about 12,000 house connections per year. Reflecting ONAS'
financial objectives (discussed in body of SAR), average revenues from the
sewerage charge in Dinars per m3 of water consumed would gradually increase,
as followst
1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987    1988    1989    1990
0.072   0.088   0.105   0.120   0.141   0.160   0.180   0.205   0.215
Connection and Related Charges
Connections are the property of customers. The costa of making the
connection is billed to consumera. The cost per connection which in 1982
averaged TD 70.0 includes materials and labor, plus 10% for overhead, plus a
service tax of 8% on labor. Projections from this base assume annual price
increases of 8% and 9% respectively for materials and labor.
Operating Contribution from Municipalities
This amounts to 8% of municipal property taxes (Fonds Commun des
Collectivites Locales) which have been assumed to grow at 10% per annum
including price increase adjustments.
Operating Compensatory Revenues from Government
This reflects ONAS' recovery of part of the increased value of land
and property resulting from prior projects (Loan 1088-TUN and 1675-TUN).
These revenues currently amount to TD 0.040/m3 of water consumed in areas
served by ONAS. It is the Government's intention that this be gradually
reduced and eventually eliminated after 1986.
Miscellaneous
This covers sale of treated effluents and sludge, and the interest
earned on the credit facilities offered to customers for house connections.
Such credit is for five years at 12% per annum.

EXPENSES
All expenses subject to price increases of 9% in 1983 and 8%
thereafter. Projected volume/quantities are explained below.
Personnel
Salaries and wages adjusted on basis of projected staffing levels and
staff upgrading.
Energy
Based on operating requirements, mainly pumping stations and
treatment plants.
Materials
Quantities based on projected number of new connections, lengths of
main extension or rehabilitation made on force account, and in the case of
maintenance an amount equivalent to about 0.3% of gross fixed assets in
operation.
Administrative and Other
in line with general activity of ONAS.
Taxes
Based on a 2% tax on wages for professional training plus a service
tax of 8% on labor. ONAS is currently tax exempt on sales and profit.
Capitalized Expenses
These cover the cost of extensions carried out by ONAS.
Depreciation
Calculated on a straight-line basis during the estimated useful asset
life. An average rate of 4% has been used for new treatment works and 3% for
sewerage pipes.
CASHFLOW STATEMENTS AND BALANCE SHEETS
Capital Contributions from Government
These are the Government's expected contributions towards the cost of
ONAS' investment program. For the period 1982-86, the annual amounts required
are embodied in the Government Five Year Development PLan. The Government is
expected to introduce the necessary amounts in the next Development Plan to
take care of the years beyond 1986.

Annex 16
Page 3 of 4
Capital Contributions From Customers
Contributions paid by houseowners, industries, touristic facilities
and other public administration towards financing of secondary network on the
basis of property frontage. A fixed fee of TD 20.00 per meter is charged for
the first 50 meters and estimated cost beyond that. Projected amounts have
been adjusted for annual inflation.
Long-Term Advances
These represent ONAS' credit given to customers for the cost of house
connections and related extensions of secondary sewers. Loans are repayable
in five years. Interest is set at prevailing commercial rate plus 0.5%.
Cash
Cash on hand has been forecast at levels sufficient for normal
operations.
Re ce ivab les
These have been factored at the equivalent of 2 months of sales for
private customers as well as Government agencies. Bad debts have been
estimated at 1.5% of revenues from sewerage charges, and have been deducted
from each year's gross revenues.
Inventories
During 1982, inventories were equivalent to nine months of materials,
fuel and chemical requirements. These have been projected at eight months
equivalent for 1983 and seven months thereafter.
Payables
Estimated at equivalent of (i) three months of capital expenditures
up to 1984 and two months thereafter; (ii) ten weeks equivalent of materials
and supplies and; (iii) retention money.
Long Term Debt
The projected Long Term Debt includes:
(a) The proposed Bank loan of US$ 34.0 million, including a front-end fee
of US$ 0.25 million, for 17 years, including four years of grace, and
interest of 10.97% per annum;
(b) Existing Bank Group loans and other International Lenders' loans
included in the projections on the basis of existing contracts;

(c) Proposed loans from KFW for the Medjerdah project and from the Kuwait
Fund from the Greater Tunis Third Project expected to start in 1984.
These borrowings are expected to be for periods of 20 and 25 years
respectively including a five-year grace period and to bear interest
at 4.5% and 4% per annum respectively. Also, expected loan from the
Islamic Bank for Development for the construction of three treatment
plants, for 20 years, including 4 years of grace and subject to a 3%
service fee; and
(d) As yet unidentified borrowings for ONAS' expansion after 1986. These
have been assumed to be repayable in 15 years after an initial grace
period of four years and to bear interest at 7% per annum.
