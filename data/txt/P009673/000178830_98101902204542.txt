INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$80 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance a fifth telecommunications project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report "Economic Situation and Prospects of
India" (15a_-IN, dated May 8, 1973) was distributed to the Executive
Directors as R73-113 on May 24, 1973.   The following summarizes the main
conclusions of that report. A country data sheet is attached as Annex
I.
Background
3.        The most notable feature of the past decade has been the rapid
decline in net external assistance to India. Nonetheless, over this
period the Indian economy has been substantially strengthened by the
expansion and deepening of the industrial structure and by a large
increase in agricultural production through basic technological improve-
ment in cultivation, especially in the wheat growing areas of Northern
India. The technical development in wheat, with considerable promise for
similar innovations in rice and other crops in the near future, has been
perhaps the outstanding advance in the Indian economy since the mid-sixties.
Even so, growth in the economy over the decade has not averaged more than
3.5 percent per annum; and this has not had much impact on per capita
income as the population has grown by about 2 percent per annum. In the
distribution of gains there has been little improvement for the vast
numbers of very poor Indians living in rural areas of deficient or unre-
liable rainfall or in overcrowded urban slums beyond the reach of new
employment opportunities.
4.        In contrast to agr o:ulture, industry has lagged, especially since
the mid-sixties. There have been constraints on output arising from short-
ages of foreign exchange for imported raw materials and from shortfalls in
production of local materials, some periodic like cotton, jute, sugar and
oilseeds, and others of a more persistent nature such as steel. Shortage of
power, especially recently, has also affected industry. Then, there have
been serious labor problems especially in Eastern India, and technical
management has often proved inadequate for the construction and operation of
large new projects. These physical constraints have been aggravated by the
fact that the structure of demand and of production have often been ill-
matched, especially in the case of capital goods where there has been a



- 2 -
basic imbalance between capacity and the country's savings performance. Also,
consumption demand is poorly distributed and slow growing, while exports have
not been effectively developed to supplement domestic industrial demand.
5.        The bottlenecks and imbalances which have arisen could have been
alleviated by massive amounts of foreign assistance but these were not
forthcoming. Instead, the solution had to be found within the limits
set by the balance of payments. As a result, India has had to content
herself with relieving only certain specific bottlenecks through the
import of the more urgent raw materials such as steel and fertilizer.
This has left much industrial capacity under-utilized, especially in sectors
preoducing investment goods, but also in sorae consurer industries relying
heavily upon imported materials or locally produced agricultural inputs.
Recent Developments
6.        The current economic scene is one of more than usual difficulty
because of the adverse food situation. Foodgrain production in the crop
year July 1972 to June 1973 will be only about 100 million tons compared
with about 108 million tons in the peak year 1970/71 and just under 105
million tons last year. Serious shortages have been alleviated in many
areas through the use of the buffer stock which was accumulated during the
favorable harvest years and which amounted to about 9 million tons in the
middle of 1972. But there are areas of acute suffering, for lack of
drinking water as well as of food, mainly in the arid inland regions oL
West and Central India. About 2 million tons of foodgrains are being
imported to meet basic needs until the collection of this year's spring
harvest. So for the first time in several years, food imports will add
substantially to the foreign exchange burden. In addition, public relief
and crash crop production expenditures amounting to about Rs 2.5 billion
hiave been approved thus far in 1972/73. And the tight supplies of food and
other agricultural crops have been mainly responsible 'or the sharp increase
in the average wholesale price index so far this year (April-December) of
about 8 percent or twice the rate of previous years. Further imports of 2 to
3 million tons may be required during the rest of 1973. depending upon the
outcome of procu-ement from the 1973 spring harvest. Also as India has now
been left without buffer stocks, their replenishment could add further to
foreign exchange needs OL the current and coming years.
I.        Industrial pcoduction however began to stage a recovery from
l;212  ^9 1 w:itt a protabIe growtth -ate of about 7 percent in 1972 compared
Wit.! only j percert in 1971. 3ut even with this encouraging development,
nie setback. to t-ie economy *of two successive drought years has been severe.
As a result, economic growth over 1971/72 and 1972/73 is now expected to
have averaged only 2 percent per annum.   And this low growth rate has been
associated with budgetary and blalance of payments difficulties.   The deficit
to be financed through the banking system for 1972/73 is now forecast at
Rs 5.5 billion, or double the original estimate, despite tax receipts well
in excess of budget estimates. The principal factor has been the large
amount of additional expenditure by the States Lor bo-th current and capital
outlays which has beern met by the Central Government. But, rises in defence
costs aid such other items, as drought-re:lated expenditures have also been



- 3 -
contributory factors. The recently passed budget for 1973/74 plans further
mobilization of domestic resources through a 13 percent increase in tax re-
venues. The amount of the increase in expenditures is also to be curbed in an
effort to reduce this year's deficit to about half that of last year.
8.        The difficulties encountered in the balance of payments stem
principally from the continued decline in net transfers of aid, which were
expected to be only US$215 milLion in 1972/73 compared with US$443 million
in 1971/72 and the peak figure of US$1.3 billion in 1965/66. Thus, even with
exports showing a reasonable increase and with a drawdown of reserves, the
total foreign exchange resources were only sufficient to finance imports in
1972/73 at about US$160 million below the level of the previous year.
9.        Once again, therefore, as has so often been the case, economic
activity is being cramped by the irregularities of the weather and by
balance of payments difficulties. Weather conditions will determine
economic prospects for the latter part of 1973 and for 1974. Assuming reason-
able monsoons, the economy should be capable of expanding quite rapidly. An
important constraint upon realizing this potential is likely to be shortage
of foreign exchange in general and, more specifically, a shortage of foreign
exchange for industrial raw material imports.
India's Overall Resource Position
10.       India is confronted with enormous social and administrative
problems in mobilizing resources in face of extensive poverty. The recession
of 1966 and 1967 compounded these difficulties to the extent that domestic
savings as a percentage of NDP went down from around 10 percent in the early
1960s to 7.4 percent in 1967/68. Since then the percentage has risen steadily
to reach 10 percent in 1971/72, but this level is still inadequate to sustain
satisfactory growth in the economy. Furthermore, despite the efforts proposed
in 1973/74 to mobilize additional resources, the 1972 drought is bound to
have a depressing effect upon domestic savings over the short term. So even
with maximum feasible efforts in increasing domestic savings, the rate of
growth of the economy will be constrained unless additional resources can be
made available from abroad.
11.       The prospects for obtaining additional resources from abroad to
finance imports will depend upon export potential, the extent to which
foreign reserves can be drawn down, and the quantum as well as the form of
foreign assistance. Export earnings have shown a decidedly upward trend over
the past two years, but the increase achieved in 1972/73 will be difficult to
maintain as much of the improvement reflects the recovery of the cotton
textile industry from raw cotton shortages of 1971, and the particularly
favorable markets for Indian jute in the adverse circumstances of Bangladesh
jute textile production. Engineering goods exports, which did so well in
previous years, slowed down in 1972/73 as a result of increased domestic
demand for new investment. The problem of how to achieve more dynamic
export expansion as a means of improving India's import capability can be
solved only over the long term.



- 4 -
12.       Foreign exchange resources to finance a higher level of industrial
imports could b! supplemented by drawingy down reserves but, over the short
term, the scope for this is very limited. In any case by March 1973, foreign
exchange reserves are expected to be US$33 million below the level of March
1972, and to represent just under 35 percent of annual imports and debt service
payments. With payments of about US$140 million for foodgrains still to be
met, a further drawdown can be expected in the new fiscal year. Furthermore,
the use of buffer stocks during 1972/73 valued at around US$900 million
creates a potential foreign exchange requirement of massive proportions
should there be another crop failure before these stocks can be reconstituted.
The Government of India has always emphasized the inherent risks of managing
an economy which is so dependent upon the vagaries of the weather, and the
need to avoid foreign exchange reserves being drawn down much below their
present level.
13.       The amount of foreign assistance has declined sharply over recent
years; gross aid disbursements, which reached US$1.6 billion by 1965/66, had
declined to about US$900 million by 1972/73. Much of this decline (US$500 mil-
lion) resulted from the elimination of food aid. While it has been one of the
most encouraging features of India's development that the country has come
close to self-sufficiencv in food, food aid provided an important form of
resource mobilization for which, under Indian conditions, it has been
difficult to find replacements. Even though gross aid disbursements are
now at a much lower level, they still financed about 45 percent of total
imports. Net aid disbursements, as mentioned above in paragraph 8, are now
down to US$215 million and the prospects for a substantial improvement in
this amount are not encouraging.
14.       Thus India's overall resource position is seriously constrained on
the domestic side through the difficulties of resource mobilization and on
the foreign exchange side through limits on the rate of growth in export
earnings and the decline in gross and net external assistance. In these
circumstances, and in view of limits on overall foreign aid that can be made
available to India, there is an overriding need to ensure that such foreign
assistance matches the most pressing of India's import requirements.
PAT_ II - BANK GAOUP C)PEHATIONS IN INMIA
Since 1949S the Hank has made 40 loans and 50 development credits
T>l Lnc.i§3 totallT g 1US.PI;; ,1Q9 ai-,ilion and US$2,107 miLllion (both net of cancel-
-tirI), Eresieetivel.se 03 t!ueae amOnlS, US$573 million has been repaid and
.,-,'k -illion is still undisbursed.   Total Bank and IDA debt outstanding and
1m::uuJ?se  on Liarch 31, '73 was usi542 million and us$2,1c5 million, which to-
gettaer constitute about 20 percent of total external debt on that date.  Principal
and interest pay tments in 1 973/714 to the Bank and IDA are expected to amount to
JS,ii77 million and US$13 rnillion, respectively, or about 1' percent of total debt
service. Annex II contains a summary statemnent oI' disbursements as of April 30,
1573, and notes on the status of currently active loans and credits.
16.       Since 1957, INC has rrmade 13 commitments in India totalling US$42
rrillion of which US$5 million has been reDaid, US$7 million sold and US87
mt'illion cancelled.  Of the balance of' U2-3 -million, US$16 million represents



- 5 -
loans and US$7 million equity. A summary statement of IFC operations as of
April 30, 1973, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
17.       The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years has
been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects the
importance of agriculture, which contributes about 50 percent of India's GNP,
and the corresponding investment priorities of the Government, Two projects
in agricultural credit were approved by the Executive Directors on 1Nay 2iL,
while a further agricultural credit project and an apple-processing project in
Himachal Pradesh are expected to be ready for consideration early in the fall.
1$.      Wghile the emphasis has been on agriculture, lending to industry has
also been a prominent feature of this year's program. Credit No. 356 provi-
ded US5IQ million for the Industrial Development Bank of India, while documents
for an eightih industrial imports credit and a tenth loan to the Industrial
Credit and Investment Gorporation of India have been distribuned to the Executive
Directors for discussion on June 7. In addition to a US$85 million credit
(No. 377) for the improvement and expansion of infrastructure in power and
the proposed credit, a credit was approved on May 15 for water supply in
Bombay. An urban infrastructure project in Calcutta is expected to be ready
for consideration in July or August.
19.       Looking further ahead, Bank Group lending can be expected to continue
in support of the same sectors with siLmilar emphasis placed on agriculture.   The
selection of individual projects will also take into account the desirability
of responding to social needs. To the extent possible, priority will be given
to projects benefitting small farmers, small industry or backward regions and
to projects which are likely to have significant employment effects.
PART III -- THE SECTOR
20.       The wide dispersion of industry within India -- cotton and textiles
in the west, iron and steel in the northeast, forestry and timber in the central
area and agriculture along north Indian plains and the river deltas -- generates
a very great movement of goods throughout the country-. This places special
demands on telecommunications to aid the flow of information between the in-
dustriat commercial and population centers within these regions and the prin-
cipal trading centers of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and New Delhi. Similarly,
the organization of State Governments, with their close dependence on the
Central Government, generates considerable traffic between the fifteen State
capitals and New Delhi. The long distance network is generally heavily
overloaded and trunk calls are subject to long delays.
21.       The Telecommunications Branch of the Posts and Telegraphs Department
(P & T), under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commmnications, operates
all public telecommunications facilities in India and to adjoining countries.
Overseas services are operated by the Overseas Communications Service (OcS),
a separate Government authority. P & T is controlled by a seven-member board
of senior executives that formulates policy and is responsible for day-to-day
operations.  P & T has adbquate autonomy, its technical management is sound,



and the Telecomxnincations Branch is œaking good progress in the financial
reforms which are being implemented according to agreements in previous
I)A credits and which are providing a basis for eventual operation along
commercial lines. The present overall level of tariffs is reasonable, per-
initting the Branch sufficient revenue to cover its financial requirements,
incluiding financing a substantial portion of its capital expansion from
internaL sources.
22.       An important feature of telecomminication development in India,
designed to conserve scarce foreign exchange, has been the move toward self-
reliance in the manufacture of switching and transmission equipment, cable
and teleprinters in three Governmreent owned factories: (a) Indian Telephone
Industries Ltd. (ITI) which manufactures switching and transmission equipment,
(b) Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL), and (c) Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL).
Together with the P & T workshops, which produce a number of labor-intensive
items, these factories supply about 75 percentv of the telecom,lrunications
vl'_ant and equipment used by P & T. Moreover, the foreign exchange content
of' Indian factory production has declinerd in the case of all three factories.
The ove-all price, quality and delivery Lrom these factories are coLm-parable
to those generally cbtaining on t'he world market. Improvemento in thre pro-
ductvioin of crossbar equipment, which constituted a problem in its initial
stagfes, have been achieved through measures taken under the previous IDA
tojecoirb;.-wnications credit.
23.       Since April 196P, the start of the iourth Five-Year Plan, the nut-
ber of t1elephone subscribers has gro'-rr fro-m 814,000 to 1,114,000 and is
expected to increase to 1 ,308,000 by the enci of the Fourth Plan period. The
long distance network has been expanded by about 10,000 trunk circuits, and
about 'LC, percent of long distance calls are now subscriber dialled. The telex
svste.mt. has a present capacity of 1C,0' lines, compared with 6,000 at the
beginrLing of the Fou:"th Plan, and will reach 13,000 by March 1971X.

PART IV -- THE; PROJECT
26.       This credit would be the Bank Group's fifth lending operation in
support of telecommunications in India. Two credits, 28-IN and 58-IN totalling
US$75 million helped finance the foreign exchange costs of the telecomsimunica-
tions expansion program initiated during the Third Five-Year Plan (1960/61-
1965/66); a combined Bank/IDA project, Loan 615-IN/Credit 153-IN totalling
US$55 million, and Credit 241-IN for US$78 million did the same for the Fourth
Plan period 1968/69-1973/74).
27.       Current estimates indicate that the previous IDA Credit will be
about 70 percent disbursed by March 1974 and fully disbursed by the Closing
Date of December 31, 1974. Because the lead time for procurement of tele-
communications equipment is about two years, the commitment of additional
foreign exchange is required now in order to allow a smooth tendering, or-
dering and delivery process without disrupting the continuity of the con-
struction program. All but about US$5 million of Credit 241 is already
committed against orders on foreign suppliers and on domestic factories, and
orders for the balance are expected to be placed within the next 6-8 months.
28.       P & T's five-year development program under India's Fifth Five-Year
Plan (197lJ75-1978/79) aims to improve and increase the capacity of the domes-
tic telephone system by 825,000 more lines to perrnit connection of an additional
770,000 subscriber connections, and to add long distance facilities that would
increase the number of trunk channels by 60,000 and telex lines by 10,000. The
extension of service to rural areas is an important feature of the program,
one which will help to bring the countryside out of isolation and promote
rural development. The total cost is estimated at US$1.66 billion equiva-
lent with a foreign exchange component of US$305 million.
29.       The project covers essentially the first two years (1974/75 and
1975/76) of P & T's five-year development program. It was appraised by an
IDA mission in January 1973 and negotiated in Washington in May 1973. The
Borrower was represented by Mr. S. N. Hanganathan, Member, Development,
Mr. A. K. Gupta, Deputy Chief Engineer, and Mr. G. N. Muthuswami, Director>
Accounts. A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III.
30.       The project would connect an additional 258,000 direct exchange lines
(DELs), providing for a 10 percent annual growth rate; expand long distance
facilities to provide an additional 17,100 trunk circuits; expand trunk exchange
capacities; extend service to rural areas by providing 2,000 additional public-
call offices and 2,800 new telegraph offices; expand telex service by 6,250
lines; and provide staff housing and expand research facilities.  The project
cost has been estimated, prior to the recent international monetary adjustments-/
j/ The impact upon project costs of recent international monetary adjustments
(the devaluation of the US dollar and the movement of the rupee from
7.28 to 7.5 per US dollar) is difficult to assess with precision at the
present time, but is expected to be very small. The project is a time
slice of a continuing program, so any net changes in costs will merely be
reflected in a minor modification in the timing of additional borrowings.



at US$$34 million with a foreign exchange component of US$118 million for
imported equipment and the foreign exchange component of the factories'
production. Of the foreign exchange cost, US$17 million is covered by a
carry-over from Credit 241-IN, US$80 million by the proposed credit, US$11
million by a credit from the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) and US$6 million by a credit from Hungary. The remaining US$4 million
is expected to be available from the Government's free foreign exchange re-
sources.
31.       The financial position and performance of the Telecommunications
Branch based on the pro forma commercial accounts are satisfactory. As under
Credit 241-IN, the proposed credit requires that tariffs be sufficient to pro-
vide a minimum rate of return on average net plant in service of 11 percent.
In fact, these returns varied from 13.8 percent in 1969/70 to 19.5 percent in
1971/72; at existing tariff levels, they are projected to range from 12-16
percent over the next six years when large amounts of new assets are brought
into service. The incremental rate of return on the project itself is 13
percent.
32.       As with the previous loan/credits, the proposed credit would be
used for imported equipment by P & T (US$31 million) and for reimbursement of
the foreign exchange content of goods supplied by the domestic telecomrmunca-
tions factories (US$49 million). Equipment imports financed by the proposed
credit would be purchased after international competitive bidding, with the
possible exception of switching equipment valued at about US$12 million equiv-
alent for which P & T may undertake negotiated purchases in the interest of
standardization. Materials and components imported by the domestic factories
would be obtained through methods of international procurement as normally
employed by factories; experience has shown that the telecommunications fac-
tories can be relied upon to Make good commercial use of the IDA funds. Items
to be purcnased under the proposed credit are expected to be ordered wiTthin
the next 12-18 nonths, and disbursements completed within three years.  The
proposed credit -would be rA'Lsbursed against the c.i.f. cost of goods imported
by P & T and agaiast a fixed wrcentase of the selling price of goods purchased
by P & T fromn the Government telecommunication factories.  These percentages
-   percent for HTL, 25 percent for ITI and 51 percent for HCL -- represent
the average forei gn exchange conrtent of the product mix from each factory.
3.        Throughout the &tnk GrDupts 10-year association with telecomnoLnica-
tious irn India, considerable progress has been made in gradually strengthening
tne Eector and 2dking it operate more efficiently.  To this end, measures have

Co i,aprovte ianaer.am-nt, an;)! t,o reorgarnize P & T' s financial system along accepted
cor.trcialrLines.  Similar provisions would be included in the proposed credit;
during negotiations it was agreed that measures to increase ITI's switching
output would be contLnued? that P & T's materials management staff would be
strengthened and that P & T woild progressively extend its commercial accounting
system to the regional level.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 2
La No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Compan; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961 ;s Closing date: December 21,t 1272
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date-was January
31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by technical and
managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new collieries to supply
IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together with technical consultants, has been
providing constant supervision and progress is being made in resolving the tech-
nical issues. On the managerial side, the Government of India announced on
July 20, 1972, that it was taking over the management of IISCO for two years.
The Government has assured us that this action will not interfere with IISCO's
obligation to the Bank. On April 30, 1973, US$1.7 million remained undisbursed
of which about   US$1 million has been earmarked for equipment on order and
technical services, while US$0.7 million may be cancelled by the closing date
of December 1973. The Bank has approved some increase in short-term indebted-
ness as well as a rehabilitation program and has also agreed in principle to a
reduction in the Bank's mortgage cover.

- Pro ect US$60.0 million loan of October 2   1     Closing
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of the
business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
June 30, 1970, for 414-INt has been extended three times to June 30, 1973 and
21  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

that for 515-IN twice, from December 31, 1971 to December 31, 1973. Loan 683-IN
has been fully committed as of December 31, 1972. Disbursements under Loan 789-IN
are ahead of schedule.
Cr No.  89     Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 22, 1266: Closing
date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign ex-
change cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has been
subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated develop-
ment of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the credit out-
standing is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery up to December 31, 1973,
and as a result, the original closing date of December 31, 1972, has been
postponed by a year.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Association
has approved plans for tie expansion of an existing seed processing plant and
construction of a new plant. Orders have been placed for the equipment re-
quired for the former and tenders for equipping the latter plant have been
readvertised following rejection of earlier bidding as unresponsive. A major
difficulty has arisen because of a lack of response to tenders for land-levelling.
This iwoblem is being overcome through demonstrations under field conditions in
the project area for contractors. A proposal is curently under discussion', which
woilid permit contractors to purchase imported equipment of their choice for land-
levelling.
TelecommunicatignsIII- US27. _million loan,of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: June 30, 1297
The project, which was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50
percent by an IDA credit (153-TN),was designed to assist in financing the
telecomrunications eXpansion program for the first three years of the Fourth
"lan period (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three months prior
to the closing date, but the closLng date for Loan 615-IN has had to be post-
poned from December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. Although disbursements have
taken place broadly in line with the original schedule, there have been de-
lays in meeting project targets of about six months for local exchange
installations and up to two years for some long distance works, resulting from
difficulties experienced by local factories and foreign delivery delays of some
key items. In recent months the situation has improved, especially at the local
factories.

Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; U$5.0 millon credlit of February 9, 1970;
Closing date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam, and the
resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States of Gujarat and
Rajasthan.  The project also includes canalization, land levelling, the con-
struction- of field channels, drainage works and roads, and a program to
support agricultural development.  The project is likely to be completed about
two years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of the prime
contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to discharge his con-
tractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by departmental force
account. Since that time the Public Works Department has been making satis-
factory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area are likely to be
more extensive and more costly than expected and may not be completed until
1978. The outlook for other components of the project remains satisfactory.
As the delays in implementation have occurred at the start of the project, and
also before major investments had been made, both investment costs and benefits
will be deferred. Thus the effect of these delays upon the economic rate of
return is not likely to be significant.

June 3. 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974

Cr No. 293     Maharashtra Agricultural Credit Project; US$30.0 million credit
Harch 29, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1975
All seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9 million,
are now effective. Ebccept for the Puinjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment, all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and
medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm
investments as tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling. Implementation
and disbursement have been slower than was originally expected, mainly due to
delays in the institutional reforms required under the projects (hiring of
groundwater experts, changes in lending criteria and terms,etc.). These con-
straints have now been overcome a-id the rate of disbursement is accelerating.
A recent mission has made recommendations to GOI to further improve project

performance. By April 30, 1973, US$26.8 million out of US$35 million had
been disbursed -- under the first to be approved, the Gujarat project.
In all uS$56.0 million had been disbursed by April 30, 1973.
The only major problem which remains unresolved is the procure-
ment of tractors (which account for almost 30 percent of the credits).
The imposition by the Government of India of a 40 percent import duty and
the realignment of the rates of exchange of international currencies con-
tributed to the delays. Difficulties were also experienced in finalizing
tender documents. The exchange realignment of 1971 was instrumental in
distorting bid prices to the extent that the Government had to withdraw the
Punjab tender and to re-advertise. Fresh bids have been evaluated, but
further progress with procurement is delayed pending consideration of
a request by GOI that the Association should finance indigenous as well
as imported tractors, Tender invitations in the case of the other credits
are delayed pending the discussions on the Punjab case.
Cr No. 230      Agro-Aviation_ US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing date:  December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government was considering the
procurement arrangerents for the importation of aircraft.    The Government's
proposals have recently been received and are under review.
Cr No. 241      Telecormmunications IV: US$78.0 million credit of May 31 1971;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and has
been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over the
last two years of -the Fourth ilan (1969-74).   Procurement action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed. Production problems
in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about 6-9 months.    However,
production has now picked up and as of March 31, 1973, US$7.9 million had been
dibibursed under the credit. FiuM disbursement is expected by the closing date
of December 1974.
Cr No. 2L;2     Power Trarsmiss i n I I - S7.0 million credit of Ma 31971;
Closin_ate.    Septembe          .
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 416-IN,
is designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems associated
with preparing bid document suitable for internttional bidding and the analysis
of the very large number of bids involved, but contract awards have now been
made for much of the major eqLipment so that more rapid disbursement can be
expected. Disbursements should be completed by the closing date of September 30,
1975.

Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer; US$20.0 million credit of July 30s 1971;
Closing date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of
fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. After initial delays, the
project is now proceeding about six months behind schedule. However,res-
ponse to tenders has been disappointing and procurement difficulties and
labor problems could lead to additional delays.
Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage; U a5.0 million credit of August 23, 19.71
Closing date: 'September 30, 1975
This credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's
wheat belt, was declared effective on November 14, 1972.
Cr No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing date: March 31, 1977
This project comprises the conBtruction of a dam on the Godavari
River, a concrete-lined main canal, an irrigation distribution system to serve
100,000 ha, agricultural support services and the construction of village
roads. With the exception of the lining of the main canal, the project civil
engineering works are generally proceeding satisfactorily, and disbursements
are ahead of schedule. Bids for two canal-lining contracts, opened in March
1972, were unreasonably high, and the contracts were retendered.   Again, in the
view of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, the bids were too high. Further
evaluation of the bids is now taking place in order to avoid a third tender.
The program for agricultural development, which has been falling behind schedule,
is receiving close attention by the State Government, with assistance and advise
from the Government of India and IDA review missions.
Cr No. 279     Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7, 1972;
Closini date:. March 21 _175
The engineering design for this project, for the expansion of an
urea plant in Uttar Pradesh, is now well advanced and equipment estimated to
cost about US$U.0 million has been ordered.   Although delivery of some
equipment may take longer than forecast during appraisal, the project is pro-
gressing without serious difficulties.
Cr No. 280     Railways XI; US$75.0 million credit of January 24, 1972
Closing date-: SePtember 30, 1974
This project, consisting of new and ongoing works in the Indian
-Railways investment program for three years beginning April 1, 1971, is pro-
gressing in a satisfactory manner. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 294     Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,
1972; Closing date: Dacember 31, 1978
This credit, which will help to finanoe the establishment of
wholesale markets in about 50 towns, was declared effective on July 31, 1972.
A supervision mission has recently visited the project and has reported very
good progress in the selection, design and appraisal of individual market
sub-projects. Disbursements are expected to begin within the next few months,
ahead of schedule.
