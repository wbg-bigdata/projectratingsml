APPRAISAL OF THE FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the Indian Posts and Telegraph's (P&T)
Fifth Five-Year (FY 1975-79) Development Program forming part of India's
Fifth Five-Year Plan.
ii.       P&T's development program aims to improve and increase the capac-
ity of the domestic telephone system by 825,000 lines (from an estimated
1,545,000 at March 1974 to 2,370,000 in 1979), to permit connection of
770,000 subscribers; and to increase long distance facilities by 60,600
trunk circuits and 10,000 telex lines. The total cost is estimated at
about US$1.7 billion equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$305 million.
iii.      The expansion program is a continuation of schemes satisfac-
torily carried out under India's Third Five-Year Plan with financing from
IDA (Credits 28-IN and 58-IN) and being carried out under the Fourth Five-
Year Plan with Bank Group assistance (Loan 615-IN, Credits 153-IN and
241-IN).
iv.       The project identified for an IDA credit covers essentially the
first two years of the Five-Year Program from April 1974 to March 1976.
It consists of connecting an additional 258,000 direct exchange lines
(DELs); expanding long distance facilities to provide additional 17,100
trunk circuits; expanding trunk exchange capacity; extending service to
rural areas by providing 2,000 additional public-call offices and 2,800
new telegraph offices; expanding telex service by 6,250 lines; providing
staff housing and expanding research facilities.
v.        The project cost is estimated at US$534 million, including US$57
million carry-over from the Fourth Plan. The foreign exchange component
of US$118 million would be financed by: the proposed IDA credit of US$80
million; the US$17 million balance of Credit 241-IN (financing the carry-
over from the Fourth Plan); a Canadian International Development Agency
credit of US$11 million; a Hungarian credit of US$6 million; and govern-
ment sources or future credits for the US$4 million balance. The local
cost would be financed from internal generated funds and Government
contributions.
vi.       As with previous loan/credits, the proposed credit would be used
for imported equipment by P&T (US$31 million) and for reimbursement of the
foreign exchange content of goods supplied by the Govrernment domestic
telecommunications factories (US$49 million).



- ii -
vii.      Equipment imports financed by the proposed credit would be pur-
chased after international competitive bidding with the possible exception
of switching equipment to a maximum value of about US$12 million equivalent
for which P&T may, on grounds of economy, efficiency and in the interest
of systems standardization, seek agreement to negotiated purchase.
viii.     P&T has adequate autonomy, its technical management is sound,
and it is making good progress in the financial reforms which are being
implemented according to recommendations of P&T's former consultants and
which are providing a basis for eventual operation along commercial lines.
The present overall level of tariffs is reasonable, permitting P&T suffi-
cient revenue to cover its financial requirements, including financing an
adequate portion of its capital expansion from internal sources. The rate
of return on the project is estimated to be 13%.
ix.       With the assurances indicated in Chapter 7, the project forms
a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$80 million.

APPRAISAL OF THE FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has applied for assistance in
financing the foreign exchange cost of the telecommunications expansion
program of the Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T) which is tied to
India's Fifth Five-Year Plan, April 1974-March 1979.
1.02      The project, which is essentially the first two years (April
1974-March 1976) of P&T's program, is estimated to cost US$534 million,
including a foreign exchange component of US$118 million. The project
costs include US$57 million carry-over from the Fourth Plan, including
US$17 million foreign exchange which is covered by Credit 241-IN. An
IDA credit of US$80 million is proposed, with CIDA and Hungary also par-
ticipating to the extent of US$11 million and US$6 million, respectively.
US$4 million of uncovered foreign exchange is assumed to be available from
Government or future credits. The IDA credit would be made to GOI and P&T,
a government department, would be the beneficiary.
1.03      The project would add an additional 258,000 direct exchange lines
(DELs), providing for a 10% annual growth rate, and would expand the long
distance facilities and improve the quality of service. The project would
be a continuation of schemes carried out under four previous Bank Group
lending operations. It is estimated that the current IDA Credit 241-IN
would be about 70% disbursed by March 1974 and fully disbursed by the
closing date of December 31, 1974. With procurement lead time of about
two years, additional foreign exchange is required now in order to allow
a smooth tendering, ordering and delivery process without disrupting the
planned ongoing expansion. Further information concerning lead time for
procuremnent of telecommunications equipment is given in Annex 1.
1.04      This report, which is confined to the telecommunications aspect
of P&T's operations except where indicated by the context, is based on
information provided by P&T and on findings of an appraisal mission
consisting of Messrs. I. A. Newstead, J. M. Vance and N. R. Holcer which
visited India in January 1973.



2. THE SECTOR
Economic Setting
2.01      India has a population of about 560 2million, second largest in
the world, and an area of over 3.3 million km which makes it the world's
seventh largest country. In 1951 GOI initiated the first of a series of
Five-Year Plans designed to foster the balanced development of agriculture,
industry, power supply and communications and to raise the standard of
living, which today is indicated by a GNP per capita of about US$110
equivalent.
2.02      The wide dispersion of industry - cotton and textiles in the
west, iron and steel in the northeast, forestry and timber in the central
area and agriculture along north Indian plains and the river deltas -
generates an enormous movement of goods throughout the country. This
places special demands on telecommunications to aid the flow of information
between the industrial, commercial and population centers within these
regions and the principal trading centers of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and
New Delhi. Similarly, the organization of State Governments, with their
close dependence on the Central Government, generates considerable traffic
between the fifteen State capitals and New Delhi. The long distance network
is generally heavily overloaded and trunk calls are subject to long delays.
Sector Organization
2.03      The organization of the telecommunications sector is illustrated
in Annex 2. P&T operates all public telecommunications facilities in India
and to adjoininag countries; overseas services are operated by the Overseas
Communications Service (OCS), a separate Government authority. P&T is a
Goverrment department under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communi-
cations. It is controlled by a seven-member board of senior executives
that formulates policy and is responsible for the day-to-day oparations.
2.04      An important feature of telecommunications development in India
has been the move toward self-reliance in the manufacture of cable, tele-
printers, and switching and transmission equipment in three Governnent-
owned factcories: (a) Indian Telephone Industries Ltd. (ITI) which
manufactures switching and transmission equipment; (b) Hindustan Cables Ltd.
(HCL); (c) Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL). Together with the P&T
workshops, which produce a number of labor intensive items, the indus:tries
supply ab:Iut 75% of the telecommunications plant and equipment used by P&T.
Some details of the background and operations of these factories are g,iven
in Annex 3.
2.05      The Administrative Reforms Commission in its report of May 1970
on Posts and Telegraphs recommended the retention of P&T as a Governmen1t
Department with functional separation between the Postal and Telecommui..-
cation F3ranches and operating along commercial lines. Total separation



of posts and telecommunications has been debated inconclusively in many
countries; the decision rests on views regarding the benefits of adminis-
trative unity versus the complexities of operating two large services under
one management. The present sector organization is satisfactory to the
Association for the proposed project.
Existing Facilities
2.06      The local telephone network comprises some 3,260 automatic and
1,060 manual exchanges with a total installed capacity of 1,329,000 lines
and 1,114,000 subscriber connections (DELs). Of the total installed
capacity, 1,062,000 lines (or 80%) are automatic equipment of which about
210,000 are crossbar and the remainder step-by-step equipment. Subscriber
distribution is primarily underground cable in the cities with extensive
open wire in the rural areas.
2.07      The existing long distance network comprises coaxial cable,
symmetrical carrier cable and microwave routes supplemented by spur routes
with low capacity UHF and VHF radio and open wire systems. Automatic
trunk switching equipment required for STD is installed at the main trunk
switching centers of New Delhi, Bombay and Madras and at the secondary
center of Kanpur. STD facilities have also been installed on a limited,
point-to-point basis at a number of other centers. It is estimated that
some 40% of long distance calls are subscriber dialed.
2.08      The extensive public telegraph network and a telex system, which
has almost 7,300 telex subscribers at 41 automatic exchanges, interconnect
the main centers in India. International connections are through the
INTELSAT Indian Ocean satellite via the earth station at Arvi and by
HF radio systems owned by OCS. Annex 4 gives a more detailed summary of
the existing facilities.
2.09      Progress under the Fourth Plan project has been generally satis-
factory but delays in delivery of supplies from both local and overseas
suppliers have caused some slippage. The carry-over on local exchanges
should not exceed about six months but some long distance works may be
delayed by up to two years.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      The telecommunications investment program for FY 1975-79 is
P&T's Fifth Five-Year Development Program and includes some carry-over of
works from the Fourth Plan. The total cost of the program, including a
US$57 million carry-over, is estimated at US$1.66 billion with a foreign
exchange component of US$305 million. Details of the program are given
in Annex 5 and the main items are summarized below:
(i) installation of 825,000 additional exchange lines, together
with associated expansion of cable network, distribution
facilities and buildings to permit connection of an additional
770,000 DELs, reflecting a rate of growth of DELs of around
10% per annum;
(ii)  expansion of long distance services by 60,600 trunk circuits;
installation of 28 new trunk exchanges providing an additional
capacity of 102,000 lines;
(iii) extension of existing telex exchanges and installation of
32 exchanges to provide additional capacity for 10,000 lines;
(iv)  introduction of gentex 1/ service progressively from 1977;
(v) extension of service to rural areas by providing 5,000 addi-
tional public-call offices, and 7,000 new combined postal/
telegraph offices;
(vi)  staff housing; and
(vii) expansion of telecommunications research.
The Project
3.02      The project proposed for IDA assistance is essentially the first
two years (1975 and 1976) of the program. The project's capital cost is
estimated at US$534 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$118 million. These costs include US$57 million carry-over
from the Fourth Plan, including US$17 million foreign exchange. Details
of the project service targets are shown in Annex 6. The project consists
of the following main items:
(i)  installation of 301,000 additional exchange lines, together
with associated expansion of cable network, distribution
facilities and buildings to permit connection of an additional
258,000 DELs;
1/    Automatic exchange for handling public telegraph messages.



- 5 -
(ii)  expansion of long distance facilities through provision of
about 2,000 km of coaxial cable, 6,000 km of microwave and
UHF radio routes, 9,000 km of VHF radio routes, and open wire
carrier systems together with multiplexing equipment for
adding 17,100 trunk circuits (see map);
(iii) extension of existing trunk exchanges and installation of new
automatic trunk exchanges at 12 locations providing an addi-
tional 22,400 lines; installation of 1,200 manual trunk boards
to handle additional traffic and provide manual assistance to
subscribers using trunk dialing;
(iv)  extension of service to rural areas by providing about 2,000
additional public-call offices, and about 2,800 new combined
postal/telegraph offices;
(v) expansion of existing telex exchanges and installation of
16 new exchanges to permit an increase of 6,250 telex
services;
(vi)  expansion of research and training facilities; and
(vii) staff housing (see paragraph 4.04).

3.04      The project cost estimates for imported equipment and services
are based on P&T's experience of prices obtained for the ongoing project.
These estimates are reasonable. Customs duties of 80% on imported equip-
ment and 25% on imported raw materials have been included in the project
costs. Cost estimates have not been changed after the second US dollar
devaluation but should not cause difficulties because the project is a
time slice of a continuing program, foreign exchange costs include a 10%
price contingency and estimated foreign exchange costs have a small
built-in cushion.
Contingencies
3.05      Telecommunications development is a continuous process that
occurs through the installation and augmentation of plant at thousands
of locations in any program year. While some works will cost more due,
for example, to striking rock beds or to adverse weather when laying
cable, there will be others where conditions will result in less than aver-
age costs.  Because of this wide spread in costs, plus the variety of tele-
communications works, the overall risk of a cost overrun due to physical
contingencies is small; in any case, it would result in only a slight
rephasing and retiming of target objectives. Therefore the only physical
contingency allowance included in the project cost estimates is the amount
of US$3.4 million for overseas purchase of strategic raw materials for
factory production. These stocks represent a quantity contingency against
the rejection or nondelivery of indigenous items essential to factory
production.
3.06      Price contingencies of US$38.5 million represent 8.8% of project
base cost. The local cost contingency includes US$24.3 million equivalent
to cover an expected increase of 5% per year in wages due to increase in
cost of living, both for P&T and the factory labor, and a US$6 million
equivalent for price increase in domestic supplies, land and buildings.
Foreign contingencies of US$8.2 million is for a possible 10% increase
in price of P&T imported equipment (US$3.8 million) and of factory raw
materials (US$4.4 million).
Items for IDA Financing
3.07      The credit would provide US$31 million for equipment imported
by P&T and US$49 million for foreign exchange content of local production
by the factories, representing imported materials and components. Below
are shown the amounts under various categories. Further details of these
items and the approximate breakdown of raw materials among the three
factories are given in Annex 7.



-7-
US$ Million
(a)  P&T Imports
1.  Local exchange systems - 35,000 lines              12.06
2.  Gentex - 4,000 lines                                2.26
3.  Telex - 4,300 lines                                 1.72
4.  Cable and radio systems                             2.54
5. Research, training and testing equipment             5.03
6.  P&T Workshop - material and components               7.18
Total             30.79
(b) P&T Purchase for Government Factories
Foreign exchange content of factory
production - raw materials and components        49.21
Grand Total             80.00
Procurement
3.08      All equipment imported directly by P&T and financed by IDA would
be subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement". The only exception could be for
35,000 lines of telephone switching equipment, to a maximum value of about
US$12 million (15% of the credit amount) for which P&T may, on grounds of
economy and efficiency and in the interest of system standardization, seek
agreement to negotiated purchase.
3.09      No preferential customs duties are proposed to be used in
evaluation of bids.
3.10      Equipment manufactured locally will be purchased by P&T from
Government factories or obtained from its own workshops. Except for pro-
prietary components available from only one supplier and amounting to less
than 7% of the value of factory imports, all materials and components
imported for local manufacture will be obtained through methods of inter-
national procurement as normally employed by factories.
3.11      For ensuring timely availability of equipment and cables it is
necessary that the factory production targets are met. While the Hindustan
Teleprinters Ltd. has been able to meet these requirements without diffi-
culty, there have been some difficulties in the case of ITI due to the large
expansion of output and in HCL due to labor troubles.
3.12      In the case of ITI, measures were agreed under Credit 241-IN for
improving crossbar production and the effects are now being experienced.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that action will be taken to
continue implementing these measures during the project period, which



-8-
include strengthening liaison between P&T and ITI, streamlining Govermnent
procedures to facilitate urgent purchase by ITI and the engagement of the
services of a crossbar production expert, should the crossbar production
show a decline so as to jeopardize the meeting of production targets.
3.13      In the case of HCL, due to the improved labor situation, output
rose considerably over a period of about seven months before a recent
dispute led to a short factory lockout. A high-level Goverment committee
(Pathak Committee) recently reviewed HCL's operations and made recommend-
ations for improving output, including appointment of consultants to assist
HCL in production planning and control. During negotiations assurance was
obtained that recommendations of the Pathak Committee will be followed up
by P&T.
3.14      The overall price, quality and delivery from the factories are
comparable to those generally obtaining under international competitive
bidding. (See Annex 3.)
Disbursement
3.15      Disbursement of IDA funds would be made against CIF cost incurred
by P&T in import of equipment and cables, and of materials for manufacture
in their workshops.
3.16      In respect of procurement from Government factories, it is pro-
posed, as was the case in the past credits, to disburse against invoices
to P&T a predetermined percentage representing the average foreign exchange
content of the product mix, supplied from each factory. These were esti-
mated during the appraisal mission to be:
- for ITI, 25% of the selling price (including TAXs) - this is a
reduction from the previous 25% for items other than TAXs and
60% for TAXs;
-  for HCL, 51% of the selling price - this is a reduction from
the previous 55%;
-  for HTL, 6% of the selling price - this is a reduction from
the previous 9%.
These percentages will be subject to review if substantial changes occur
in material prices or exchange rates during the period covered.
3.17      A schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements under the pro-
posed credit is shown in Annex 8. Because the project forms part of a
continuing investment program, any unused credit balance could be applied,
after consultation with IDA, to the purchase of additional goods similar
to those procured under the credit.



-9-
Project Execution
3.18      All installation and maintenance of telecommunication equipment
will be by P&T's technical staff.  The large and technically competent
staff with the existing comprehensive training schemes (see paras. 5.05
and 5.06) should ensure adequate supply of technicians and line staff for
installation and future maintenance of project works. The schedule of
exchange commissioning is given in Annex 9.
Research
3.19      There will be an emphasis during the Fifth Plan on the expansion
of technical research activities in order to meet the national objective
of self-reliance for design and manufacture of telecommunications equip-
ment needed by the country and to improve the technical operations of the
growing telecommunications network. The professional staff will increase
from the present level of 110 to around 600 and will be located in a new
research center building. The work of the center is essentially applied
research, closely geared to the design and local production of plant and
equipment tailored to meet India's specific telecommunications needs and
for research in the performance of existing plant in order to make improve-
ments. The experience of developed countries confirms the importance of
adequate research to support telecommunications operations and manufacture.
Even with the proposed expansion, the annual research budget will represent
only about 1% of telecommunications annual operating costs, which is reason-
able.
3.20      During negotiations it was suggested that P&T may undertake
research into certain economic aspects to improve knowledge of the sector
in relation to social and economic development in the country. P&T agreed
fully with the need for work in this area and will be writing to IDA after
examining the matter further.

4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The basic justification for the program, and hence the project,
is to support India's development objectives by providing an essential
service for industry, commerce and agriculture. The size of the Indian
subcontinent, the wide dispersion of industry and agriculture, and the
distances separating the heavy population centers, make good communications
essential for efficient marshalling of inputs, for efficient marketing of
output and for administration of the different services in the country.
4.02      Despite achievements of the previous Five-Year Plan, the tele-
phone density in India of 0.2 telephones per 100 population is extremely
low. (Annex 10 gives statistics of telephone density for a number of
countries.) There are still some 330,000 outstanding applicants with an
average waiting time exceeding two years, even for those under the "own-
your-telephone" (OYT) priority scheme for which the charge is an additional
$400 in major cities and up to $340 elsewhere.  The lack of adequate expan-
sion has resulted in traffic overloads in several city networks with serious
degradation of service to existing subscribers. The long distance network
is likewise overloaded, and on many routes delays of several hours are
encountered. The program of expansion during the five-year period will
still leave a considerable number of applicants waiting for service.
However, the size of the program is the largest which P&T can undertake
at present within its financial and physical resources.
14.03     To relieve congestion in the five large cities (Ahmedabad, Bombay,
Calcutta, New Delhi and Madras) where it is particularly acute, accelerated
programs are proposed which would reduce the waiting period for service to
one year by 1979. The extension of service to rural areas is an important
feature of the program which will aid agriculture and help bring the country-
side out of isolation.
4.04      Government policy calls for P&T, along with other large Government
and private sector undertakings, to make major investments in providing
adequate housing at subsidized rates to lower income staff. As part of its
Fifth Plan, P&T will provide some 50,000 staff quarters in the five-year
period, largely in provincial and rural areas, at a cost of US$199 million,
involving no foreign exchange. The project carries a proportionate share
of this housing scheme and provides 15,000 staff quarters in the first two
years at a cost of around US$51 million equivalent.
Market Demand
(a) Local Telephone Service
4.05      In March 1972 the demand for local telephone service was 1.36
million connected lines (DELs) consisting of existing DELs and waiting
applicants. P&T has estimated the growth of demand at 8% per year using



- 11 -
certain assumptions (see Annex 11). This rate of growth is undoubtedly
conservative in comparison with the growth rate in other developing coun-
tries, mainly because the forecasting by P&T does not allow for present
suppressed demand which will be revealed only when there is improvement
in extending service within a reasonable period to applicants.
4.06      Based on this growth rate, at the end of the five-year program
the demand would be 2.36 million and the number of lines connected 2.08
million, leaving still a gap of 275,000 waiting applicants.  The growth
of demand and connected lines (DELs) as per P&T projection is given in
Annex 11. Performance indicators showing the expected achievement during
the six-year period 1974-79 are shown in Annex 12.
(b)   Long Distance Service
4.07      The demand for long distance traffic is based on traffic and
circuit forecasts taking into account: (i) increase in number of tele-
phones, (ii) growth of traffic and (iii) improvement in quality of service.
P&T's long distance program has been based on traffic estimates section by
section for all the routes. Their forecasts show an expected annual growth
rate of 15% which is in line with previous experience in the country.
(c) Telex Service
4.o8      Telex growth is forecast at 12.5% per annum based on previous
trends and known demand. The installation of about 10,000 lines of
capacity during the Fifth Plan will largely meet the expected demand.
The telex expansion program would connect an additional fifty smaller
cities to the telex network. Telex serves essentially the business com-
munity and generates a high proportion of international traffic.
Least-Cost Solution
4.09      The national telecommunications development plans prescribe a
sound technical framework for the Fifth Plan expansion. Important deci-
sions already taken include the adoption of common-control crossbar to
augment and replace the older step-by-step switching system, the choice
and configuration of coaxial cable and microwave systems in the long
distance network and the development of STD to provide network economies
and better service to subscribers.
4.10      These basic decisions provide for orderly expansion of facil-
ities under this project, which for the large part comprises of thousands
of individual installations. A least cost for each of these individual
works is obtained by following an optimizing path with respect to the
design, dimensioning and timing of the many of installations carried out
annually as part of the continuous development process.



- 12 -
4.11      Optimum engineering design of large works in the project has
been achieved by making present-value studies of alternatives over a
typical 20-year period. For the smaller projects, generalized solutions
were obtained for the various classes of plant from which particular
types and sizes of plant are selected.
Return on Investment
4.12      The rate of return on the project - defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with the capital and operating costs, net of customs duties, attributable
to it - is 13% (see Annex 13). The economic rate of return is undoubtedly
higher because (i) the prices charged do not adequately measure the full
benefits to the subscribers, primarily industry, commerce and agriculture,
(ii) the costs include the full cost of extending service to new areas
even though the full benefits will only obtain when additional lines are
connected in these areas.
4.13      With the project providing some 15,000 units of adequate housing
at subsidized rates to lower income staff, important social benefits will
result from an effective income redistribution between telephone users
and P&T staff. The fact that this can be financed entirely within the
telecommunications sector, without increase in tariffs, is an added
justification of the project's economic and social worth.
4.14      A sensitivity analysis has been carried out showing that under
an unfavorable combination of the main parameters, and with labor and
foreign exchange shadow priced, the rate of return would be not less
than 9%.

5. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
5.01      Annex 2 shows P&T's organizational structure and functional res-
ponsibilities within the telecommunications sector. P&T as a government
department is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications.
It is controlled by a seven-member Board of senior executives, including
the Director General as Chairman who also holds the rank of Secretary in
the Ministry. P&T has adequate autonomy in its policy formulation and
day-to-day operations.
5.02      P&T has a strong headquarters organization, located in New Delhi.
Telecommunications in 12 of the largest cities is controlled by District
telephone managers responsible for installation design, construction and
operation. The remainder of the country is divided into 15 regions known
as Circles, each under the control of a Postmaster General with respon-
sibility for posts, savings bank and telecommunications.
5.03      Steps are being taken to decentralize telecommunications.  Four
field organizations have been created to be responsible for the detailed
planning, execution and supervision of telecommunications projects in the
North, South, East and West of India, with headquarters at New Delhi,
Madras, Calcutta and Bombay. Eventually four new regions will be formed
for telecommunication operations to provide flexibility and assign clearer
responsibility in the execution of new works.
Staff and Training
5.04      In January 1973 the Telecommunications Branch had a staff of some
200,000, including 15,000 in telegraph and 8,000 in the P&T workshops. The
present level of staffing of 17 staff per 100 DELs, while being high,
reflects particular network maintenance and operational requirements which
include: (i) extensive open wire routes that require considerable main-
tenance attention, (ii) more than 4,000 small exchanges spread throughout
India, many of them manual, (iii) large telegraph and long distance services,
(iv) extensive coaxial cable maintenance on the routes, and (v) all con-
struction is done with P&T staff. The present level of staff of 17 per 100
DELs compares to 17.9 in 1969; it is expected to fall to 16.5 at the end of
the project period in 1976. The planned rate of increase of staff over the
period 1969-76 is less than the corresponding rate of increase in number of
lines. The expected staff level is reflected in the indicators shown in
Annex 12.
5.05      P&T's training program is geared to give a thorough basic train-
ing in the technical aspect of the business such as telecommunication
techniques and equipment, operation and maintenance procedures. Training
takes place at three levels: (i) linemen, mechanics, telephone operators,
(ii) supervisory staff such as engineering supervisors and (iii) engineers.



- 14 -
The first category is trained in circle/district training centers, the
second category in five regional training centers and the third in the
telecommunications training center at Jabalpur. The training arrange-
ments are satisfactory and adequate. In the Fifth Plan, it is proposed
to set up eight additional circle/district training centers and eight
additional regional training centers. In addition, there are plans for
a UNDP-sponsored advanced level training center near New Delhi to serve
the ECAFE countries, including India.
5.06      With P&T taking over the accounting function of the Telecom-
munications Branch, a finance training program has been established. The
programs for junior as well as more senior staff consist of on-the-job
training for periods of three to five months as well as outside study,
sanctioned by an examination.
Financial Reorganization
5.o7      The Telecommunications Branch (Branch) of P&T was formerly main-
taining only cash accounts in conformity with Parliamentary requirements
with the control of the accounts resting with the Comptroller and Auditor
General (C&AG). However, in order to operate more effectively, P&T has
taken important steps to institute commercial accounting in the Branch
while also continuing separately the cash budget accounts (see para. 5.09).
Pursuant to recommendations of its former consultants (Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell & Co.) and with the approval of Government, its accounting system
has been reorganized along commercial lines, and an accounting organization
with its accounting staff under its own control has been established.
Commercial accounts (operating statement and balance sheet) are now pre-
pared at headquarters and presented to Parliament after audit by the
Comptroller and Auditor General. A system of double entry accounting has
recently been introduced in each division, which forms the basis for the
next major step in the reorganization: extending the commercial accounts
to the regional level to eventually provide a fully integrated system of
commercial accounting with financial statements and management reports
reflecting these areas' operating results. During negotiations it was
agreed that P&T will take action that will result in progressively extend-
ing the commercial accounts to the regional level and will inform the
Association periodically of the steps being taken.
5.o8      Information now provided by the commercial accounts, even though
on a global basis, is giving management a new insight into its operations.
Management is now able to see how the profit for the year has been achieved,
how the capital investment has been used and the extent to which the Branch
is able to generate funds internally to meet its financial requirements;
also, closer attention is now being paid to spotlighting accountability
for completion of projects and meeting budgets. This kind of information
enables management to run the enterprise more efficiently. Further
information on the reorganization is given in Annex 14.



- 15 -
5.09      The Telecommunications Branch at present maintains two sets
of accounts: pro forma commercial accounts and cash budget accounts
regularly required by Government under the parliamentary grant system.
It is expected that the two systems will be maintained until such time
as the commercial accounts may be formally substituted for the cash
budget accounts. The fact that the commercial accounts are audited by
C&AG and presented to Parliament gives them standing within Government
which is a prerequisite for moving the Branch's operations toward a more
fully commercial operation.
Materials Management
5.10      Under the fourth credit, consultants were engaged to study P&T's
materials management system. The consultants have now completed their
study with most of their recommendations having been accepted by the P&T
Board. Implementation, wherever possible, was to proceed concurrently
with the study and a manual of new procedures was to be prepared and train-
ing of staff started. However, because of delays in sanctioning the
recommended materials management organization and getting the staff into
position, much of the implementation is still to be done. It would there-
fore be desirable to retain the consultants to assist in implementing the
recommendations, preparing a manual for the new procedures and establish-
ing training courses for the materials management staff. One of the
important recommendations for developing an effective materials management
system is to have continuity of staff; P&T therefore should make arrange-
ments for ensuring continuity of the materials management staff. During
negotiations assurances to the foregoing were obtained.
Audit
5.11      Under the Constitution, the Comptroller and Auditor General is
responsible for auditing government accounts. He discharges his audit
responsibilities in P&T through one of his senior officers; he also con-
tinues to maintain the Postal Branch's accounts. The Telecommunication
Branch's unaudited commercial accounts are being sent to the Bank within
four months of the close of the fiscal year, but the audited commercial
accounts are being delayed by as much as one year due mainly to the Postal
Branch's accounting function remaining outside P&T and an abnormal amount
of detailed inter-branch adjustments at the end of the fiscal year. An
important factor that would help in preparing the accounts on time would
be the transfer of the Postal Branch accounting to P&T, thereby giving P&T
total responsibility for maintaining its own accounts. The Administrative
Reforms Commission has recommended the transfer, the P&T Board has approved
it and it is being further reviewed by a joint committee of P&T, C&AG and
Ministry of Finance. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the findings of the current review committee will be conveyed to IDA as
soon as possible and in any case IDA will be advised by December 31, 1973
of the progress of the committee's work. Also, agreement was reached
during negotiations that the present audit arrangements described in Credit
Agreement 241-IN will continue under the proposed credit.



- 16 _
Tariffs
5.12      While there are no regulations establishing a specific tariff
policy, review is made annually of the cost of providing service and of
revenue requirements.  Based on this review, changes in tariffs are for-
mulated within P&T, reviewed and approved by the P&T Board and then placed
before Parliament for a period of 30 days. Normally, there is little delay
in effecting changes; in the past five years there have been tariff
increases for all main services. The overall tariff structure is satis-
factory.  A summary of present tariffs is in Annex 15.
5.13      During the past five years the level of tariffs has permitted
sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, interest charges and other
transfer payments to Government, which together are equivalent in amount
to debt service under a comnercial type of operation (see para. 6.14),
and about 60% of expansion costs.
5.14      Forecasts show that during the next six years the present tariff
level would, on the same basis as above, continue to provide sufficient
revenues to finance about 50% of capital expansion and to exceed appre-
ciably the minimum rate of return of 11% on average net plant in service
presently required under Credit 241-IN. During negotiations it was agreed
that this requirement to earn an 11% rate of return will continue under
the proposed credit. The higher performance expected is reflected in the
indicators shown in Annex 12. The valuation of fixed assets is covered
by the agreement described in paragraph 6.08.



- 17 -
6. FINANCES
Background
6.01      A financial analysis of the Telecommunications Branch's opera-
tions on a commercial basis shows that the notional financial position is
sound. The most significant feature of the financial operation is the
Branch's ability to reinvest a large part of its internal sources of funds
in capital expansion. Over the past four years, when the value of plant
in service increased by Rs2 billion (US$276 million) or more than 50%,
internal sources of funds contributed 63% of total requirements. Over the
next three years the value of plant is estimated to increase by another
Rs3.8 billion (US$522 million) or 65%, and forecasts show that the Branch
should be able to continue with an expansion program of this magnitude,
achieve a rate of return of not less than 14%, provide about 50% of total
requirements from internal sources and maintain a sound financial position.
6.02      The commercial accounts show the Branch's operations on a commer-
cial basis, as though it were a separate entity and had full use of its
funds. Capital-at-charge 1/ in the balance sheet is divided between funds
raised by Government as long-term debt and contributions from Central
Government shown as equity. The Branch is shown to pay interest on the
Central Government contributions and interest on the long-term debt, but
not debt amortization (except in the case of a one-time Government loan
which the Branch was required to amortize). However, it has been subsi-
dizing the postal operations and transferring a portion of its earnings
to a fund held by Government, the sum of which together with interest
payments is included as a deduction in calculating net internal cash
generation and is approximately equivalent of conventional debt service,
including amortization on borrowed funds.
6.03      Except as otherwise indicated, the financial data in this report
are based on the commercial accounts and show the past, present and fore-
cast financial operations and position of the Telecommunications Branch,
including balance sheets (Annex 16), income statements (Annex 17), and
source and application of funds (Annex 18).
1/    As a government department whose finances form part of the National
Budget, P&T's funds are paid into the Central Government's consoli-
dated fund and made available to P&T through parliamentary appro-
priation. Funds made available by Government to the Telecommunications
Branch in excess of those from internal sources are called capital-at-
charge and consist of Central Government contributions and foreign
exchange loans, such as the Bank Group's loan/credits borrowed by
Government on behalf of the Branch. Government is responsible for
servicing the debt on these loans. Capital-at-charge is treated as
a non-repayable loan to the Branch on which annmal interest at
6-3/4% is paid.



- 18 -
6.O4      The accounts of the Telecommunications Branch and Postal Branch
are kept separate and all financial data in this report apply only to the
Telecommunications Branch.
Past Operations and Present Financial Position
6.05      Income statements for 1970-73 and related notes are shown in
Annex 17. The Branch's operating results over the past four years have
been satisfactory. Operating ratios varied between 64% and 70%. Net
operating income has been equal to returns on average net plant in service
ranging from 13.8% in 1970 to 19.5% in 1972 when there was a tariff increase
as well as increased utilization of exchange spare capacity - a legacy of
the previous few years' acute cable shortages.
6.o6      During the past four years the Branch, on a notional basis, has
financed 63% of its requirements from internal sources: 52% from internal
cash generation after providing for interest payments on capital-at-charge
and amortization of a Government loan, Postal Branch transfers and transfers
to a fund held by Government; and 11% from OYT and subscriber deposits;
the remaining 37% was financed from borrowings (22%) and Government
contributions (15%).
6.07      Collection performance is improving through better billing and
collection procedures, including prompt disconnection of late-paying
subscribers. Subscriber receivables based on current billings amount to
about six weeks' billings.
6.o8      Balance sheets for 1970-73 are presented in Annex 16. The present
book value of fixed assets is based on historical cost and is considered
realistic: a high proportion of the assets has been recently built - the
amount of assets has almost doubled over the last six years; moreover,
about 70% of the value of the plant is local cost and that portion which
was imported was subject to overall customs of about 60%; thus, the value
of fixed assets is relatively insensitive to exchange rate variations.
However, as provided under Credit 241-IN, the periodic review of the value
of net fixed assets to determine whether adjustments should be made on account
of variations in the applicable price levels in the economy will continue
under the proposed credit.
6.09      Depreciation, including supplementary depreciation, has been
computed on a straight-line basis, based on the life of the various cate-
gories of plant in service. Rates vary from 21g for buildings to 15% for
vehicles which, with the supplementary depreciation, results in a composite
rate of about 519. The supplementary depreciation, taken as a hedge against
any inflation and amounting to a composite rate of about 1%, is charged
against revenue but is taken to equity reserves rather than being reflected
in depreciation reserve in arriving at net plant in service. This is
acceptable.
6.10      The Telecommunications Branch's notional capitalization, based

6.11      These figures show a conservative capital structure where debt
is equal to 24% of capitalization. It indicates a financing pattern where
the Branch is investing a large portion of its earnings for expansion and
where Government is providing funds as equity.
6.12      Funds with Government consist of those funds transferred by the
Branch and held by Government to cover any shortfall the Branch may have
in meeting its interest payments on capital-at-charge. The amount of these
funds is deducted from capital-at-charge in calculating the interest due
from the Branch on its capital-at-charge (see para. 6 of Annex 16).
Financing Plan
6.13      The forecast of sources and applications of funds for the period
1974-1979 (Annex 18) is based on the Branch's new Five-Year Program, details
of which are given in Annex 5; forecast earnings given in Annex 17; borrow-
ings given in Annex 16; and estimated increases in working capital.
Following is a summary of the financing plan for the three-year period
1974-1976, which includes the two-year project period, and for the six-year
period 1974-1979 which includes the period of the new Five-Year Program.
1/    Reflects upward valuation of debt, as a result of the two US$ devalua-
tions, as at close of fiscal year 1973 amounting to Rs92 million
equivalent (equivalent to 7% of long-term debt); capital-at-charge
representing Central Government contributions was correspondingly
reduced.

6.14      Included as deductions from internal cash generation are interest
payments, postal transfers and transfers to a fund held by Government (see
para. 6.12). The total of these deductions are approximately equivalent of
conventional debt service, including amortization on borrowed funds; thus,
the amount of cash generation shown is not inflated due to the Branch not
amortizing its debt.
6.15      Postal Branch transfers are assumed to continue as in the past
(see page 3 of Annex 17). Under IDA Credit Agreement 241-IN, funds of
the Telecommunications Branch will not be diverted to the Postal Branch,
or for any other use, unless all funds required for carrying out the
proposed project are available to the Telecommunications Branch. This
agreement will remain in effect under the proposed credit.

6.16      Included as borrowings by Government on behalf of P&T, details
of which are given in paragraph 10 of Annex 16, are a CIDA credit of US$11
million equivalent and a Hungarian credit of US$6 million equivalent.
During negotiations the details of this financing were confirmed.
6.17      The forecast financial statements in this report show the Branch
paying annual interest at 7% on the total amount of Government borrowings
on behalf of the Branch, which forms the long-term debt portion of the
Branch's capital-at-charge, and on Central Goverrment contributions, which
is the equity portion of capital-at-charge.
6.18      The foregoing financing plan shows on a notional basis net
internal sources of funds for the three-year period 1974-1976, which
includes the period of the project, would be equivalent to 50% of con-
struction costs and working capital increase; Government's equity invest-
ment would amount to 25% and borrowings 25% of which 11% would be the
proposed credit. The financing of 50% of total requirements from internal
sources is very satisfactory, considering that the value of plant in service
is expected to increase by Rs3.8 billion (US$522 million) - an increase
of 65%.
Future Finances
6.19      Forecast balance sheets and income statements for 1974-1979 are
shown in Annexes 16 and 17 and are based on existing tariffs. Operating
revenues over the next six years are estimated to increase at an average
annual rate of 14%. operating expenses are estimated to increase about
the same rate and are based on the larger network and increased number of
staff and level of remuneration. These increases are of the same order as
in the past. The rate of return is expected to decline from 17.5% in 1973
to a level ranging between 16% and 12% of average net plant in service
during the six-year period when large amounts of new assets are being
brought into service.  Operating ratios would be satisfactory at about 70%.
Performance indicators showing the expected operating revenue and expenses
per DEL and the expected rates of return during the period 1974-79 are given
in Annex 12.
6.20      The forecast financial position is satisfactory.  During the
six-year period 1974-1979 the value of plant in service is expected to
increase by Rs1O.3 billion (US$1.4 billion) - an increase of 1.8 times.
The notional debt/equity ratio would remain at about 25/75 during the six
years, reflecting a notional financing pattern where the Branch would
continue financing expansion mainly with internal sources of funds (50%)
and Government contributions (31%), and the remainder with borrowings (19%).
Fiscal Impact
6.21      The fiscal impact of the Branch's operations on Government will
be favorable. During the period 1974-1979 it is estimated that there will
accrue to Government some Rs3,813 million resulting from the Branch's
operations. The expenditure for the housing subsidy amounting to Rsl,449
million can be construed as a further contribution to Government. These
contributions to Government amounting to Rs5,262 million corpare to the
Branch receiving Rs4,051 million from Government (see Annex 19).

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) Action will be taken to continue the measures that were agreed
under Credit 241-IN to help increase ITI's switching output
(para. 3.12);
(b) Measures recommended by the Pathak Committee for improving
HCL's output will be followed up (para. 3.13);
(c)  P&T will take action that will result in progressively extending
the commercial accounts to the regional level (para. 5.07);
(d) Consultants will be retained for assisting in implementing
recommendations pertaining to the materials management system,

materials management staff (para. 5.10);
(e) The findings of the committee reviewing the recommendations
for transferring the Postal Branch accounts to P&T will be
conveyed to IDA as soon as possible, and the present audit
arrangements described in Credit Agreement 241-IN will continue
under the proposed credit (para. 5.11);
(f) Tariffs will be maintained at a level to provide revenue suffi-
cient to earn a minimum rate of return of 11% on average net
plant in service (para. 5.14); and
(g) Funds of the Telecommunications Branch will not be diverted to
the Postal Branch, or for any other use, unless all funds
required for carrying out the project are available to the
Telecommunications Branch (para. 6.15).
7.02      With the indicated agreements and assurances, the project is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$80 million equivalent.

Lead Time for Procuring and
Commissioning of Telecommunications Equipment
1.        Parts of the current program, with the exception of cables,
will be completed progressively by early 1974. For efficient operations,
the scheduling of new construction should be such that construction crews
can continue without a gap. Therefore, foreign exchange commitment is
required now in order to proceed smoothly on a continuing basis with the
new project allowing for tendering, ordering and delivery. Procurement
lead time, the time from initial procurement action until equipment installa-
tion and commissioning, is about two years and can run to three years
depending upon the type of equipment. The following is an example of
average lead time for procuring and commissioning telecommunications
equipment:
1. Preparation and clearance of specifications
and calling for bids                            3 - 4 months
2. Time to submit bids                              3 - 4 months
3.  Evaluation of bids, decision on award
and finalizing the contract                         4 months
4.  Commencement of delivery and shipping time          9 months for
cables
15 -18 months for
exchange and
microwave
equipment
5.  Installation and commissioning                  6 - 12 months
2.        The position with respect to factory imports is similar:  the
raw materials have to be ordered in advance with the time for ordering
and delivery taking 9 to 12 months plus another 8 months for manufacture.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
Notes on the Telecommunications Manufacturing Industries
INTRODUCTION
With the development of telecommunications through a series of
expansion programs tied to the national Five-Year Plans, an important
decision of the GOI has been to move toward self-reliance in the manu-
facture of supplies of telecommunications stores and equipment in Govern-
ment-owned factories and P&T workshops. As a result, the three factories,
ITI, HCL, HTL, and the P&T workshops, today supply about 75% of the tele-
communication plant and equipment used by P&T. Moreover, realizing that
an essential prerequisite to development of telecommunications is the
ready availability of telecommunications stores and equipment from indige-
nous sources in the coming years, Government has taken measures to augment
the indigenous supply. Two high level committees were created: one under
chairmanship of M. S. Pathak, to assess the long term needs of telecommuni-
cation stores and equipment, and to increase indigenous production capacity;
and the other, under the chairmanship of Prof. M. K. G. Menofl, to review,
strengthen and advance research and development work. An outcome of this
was the decision to:
(i) build a second cable factory which is scheduled to be opera-
tional in 1974/1975 at Hyderabad;
(ii) double the production of the existing cable factory in 1973
at Rupnarainpur;
(iii) build a new factory for transmission equipment and telephone
instruments, both of which are scheduled to be operational
in 1974/1975 at Naini;
(iv) build a second switching factory scheduled for operation in
1976/1977 at Rae Bareily; and
(v) double the production of the existing switching factory at
Bangalore.
However, before this new production capacity is available, the
existing factories have to supply the necessary stores and equipment.
Information summarizing the three existing Government factories, ITI,
HTL, and HCL, and the P&T workshops follows:



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 6 pages
Indian Telephone Industries Limited (ITI)
1.        The factory, which commenced operation in 1950, is owned by GOI
(77%), the Mysore State Government (7%), and the two collaborating com-
panies - Plessey, England (4%) and International Standard Electric
Corporation, USA (for Bell Telephone Manufacturing Co., Belgium) (12%) on
whose designs switching equipment is based. Now employing a staff of
about 15,000, ITI's production value in 1971/1972 was Rs 232 million
(equivalent to US$31.9 million). The production consists of step-by-step
and crossbar switching equipment, line and cable systems, microwave radio
systems, telephones and numerous lesser items of telecommunication and
signalling equipment. P&T buys about 80% of the factory's output, the
balance going to other public sector and private users in India as well
as export. Factory production has been established on the basis of P&T's
expansion plans, and ITI plans to increase production facilities, both at
the existing plant in Bangalore, and at the new factories in Rae Bareily
and Naini.
2.        The value of ITI's output to P&T during the Fourth Five-Year
Plan was estimated to reach US$154 million. But in the last few years
the large expansion of output has created some difficulties, especially
in maintaining balanced crossbar production, due to high rejection rates
of indigenous materials, late delivery or nondelivery of key materials
and components, and deterioration and breakage of crossbar production
tools. During the appraisal in 1971 measures for improving crossbar
production were agreed, and the fruitful effects are now being experienced.
These measures are:
- the employment of productioni consultants from the parent
company, Bell Telephone Manufacturing Co., Belgium;
- a review of the system and procedures for procurement of mate-
rials and components for the production of switching equipment;
- the appointment of the Member (Development) P&T as a member of
the Board of Directors of ITI for direct and high-level coor-
dination between P&T and ITI;
- a revision of the purchasing agreement between P&T and ITI
to place responsibility for the achievement of balanced cross-
bar production targets more directly with the top management
of ITI;
- the importation of contingency supplies of strategic materials
and components for crossbar production; and
- a streamlining of government procedures to facilitate urgent
purchase of relatively small quantities of materials, compo-
nents or production tools.



ANNEX 3

3.        The success of the new program and project depends heavily on
the ability of ITI to produce the necessary output level; therefore, in
order to achieve the planned targets continued emphasis will be required
on production planning, material procurement, industrial relations, and
general factory management.
4.        ITI's production depends on the import of raw material and
components for which Bank/IDA financing is necessary. At the 1971
appraisal the foreign exchange content of ITI production was 25% of the
selling price to P&T for all items other than TAX equipment (value about
US$6.1 million in 1972/73 and 1973/74) for which foreign exchange reim-
bursement in the fourth credit was 60%. For the fifth credit a 25% figure
is proposed for the whole production, including the TAXs which means a
reduction compared with the fourth credit. The principal items for the
ITI products, out of many still being imported, are tempered sheets and
strips of nickel-silver, phosphor-bronze, brass and bimetals, moulding
powder, tissue paper, fine gauge copper wire, resistance wire, phenolic
laminates, magnets, ferrities, capacitors, transistors, diodes, klystrons,
measuring instruments, and some piece parts for crossbar manufacture.
Procurement of the above items is through methods of international procure-
ment as normally employed by factories. Some proprietary items incor-
porated in the design of equipment are available from only one source,
and piece parts are brought in from the collaboration firms that were
originally selected on the basis of international competition.
5.        Switching equipment accounts for about 45% of the value of P&T's
purchase from ITI. Step-by-step equipment has been locally manufactured
since 1950 and now has a foreign exchange content of only 15%. The sell-
ing price to P&T during the Fifth Plan period is estimated at about
US$100. Crossbar switching equipment will eventually become standard for
all installations. During the Fourth Five-Year program about 35% of new
lines installed will be crossbar. It is expected that the production of
the existing and new factory in the Fifth Plan period will change this
percentage to 65%. The average crossbar prices per main exchange line
over the Fifth Plan period is estimated at about US$165. After deducting
the customs due on imported raw materials and components, the factory
selling prices are comparable or below prices paid in the major telecom-
munications producing countries or the prices obtained recently in an
international tender under the Credit 241-IN.
6.        The transmission equipment purchased by P&T is made up of
coaxial cable systems, microwave systems, open wire carrier systems and
voice frequency telegraph systems. The transmission production of ITI
has alreadr been augmented by a new factory at Naini (Uttar Pradesh State
in north India) which will produce in 1976 about 40% of the requirements
mix of transmission equipment at that time. With this additional produc-
tion the transmission production can largely meet with P&T's requirements

of the Fifth Plan. However, during the first three years, it will be
necessary to import broad band microwave equipment with TV capability
and some 12 Mhz coaxial systems. Prices for all but small production
items have proved to be less than the international prices.
Hindustan Cables Limited (HOL)
7.        The factory is wholly Government-owned and started operations
in 1954 under a collaboration agreement with Standard Telephones and
Cables Ltd., England. HCL now employs a staff of 2,600 and the value
of output in 1971/72 was Rs48.1 million (US$6.6 million equivalent).
This is only about 50% of the installed plant capacity. Production was
retarded with poor labor relations a major factor. During 1972 the
improved political situation in West Bengal had improved labor relations
when output reached about 80% of targets over a period of seven months
when a recent dispute led to a short factory lockout. A high level
Government committee (Pathak Committee) recently reviewed HCL's opera-
tions and made the following recommendations which are to be implemented:
(i) appointment of consultants to advise HCL on improving its production
planning and control; (ii) incentive schemes for officers, supervisors
and workmen; and (iii) involvement of key labor personnel within HCL in
committee dealing with HCL's labor problems.
8.        A second cable factory at Hyderabad is under construction and
is scheduled to be operational in 1974/75; this should further help to
meet part of the large gap in meeting P&T's requirements for cables.
9.        P&T buys all of HCL's production which consists of paper insu-
lated subscriber cable (approximately 70% by value) small and large tube
coaxial trunk cable (25%) and plastic insulated cable for internal wiring
(5%). A collaboration agreement exists with Sumitomo of Japan for produc-
tion of copper-clad steel wire for aerial lines. HCL has also begun
production of aluminum sheathed cables for which new production machinery
was recently installed.
10.       During the first two years of the Fifth Plan period, the value
of HCL's output to P&T is estimated to be Rs410 million (US$56.3 million).
The foreign exchange component is US$29.2 million: us$6.5 million financed
by Credit 241-IN, US$20.6 million financed by the proposed credit and
US$2.1 million to be financed from future credits (see paragraph 1.02).
The foreign exchange content of the cable comprises copper, lead, manila
paper, and fine gauge steel tapes and is estimated at 51% of HCL's selling
price under the proposed credit. This is a reduction from the previous
55% and is attributable to increased indigenization in the manufacture.
11.       Because of the high degree of mechanization in cable manufacture
and also the low wage scales in India, labor represents only about 12% of
the value of output. This means that the labor problems and the conse-
quent lowering of labor productivity has not had a serious effect on HCL's
cable prices which are highly competitive in world markets. HCL cable

prices are in line with CIF prices of similar cables obtained in recent
international bidding. A comparison of recent international cable tenders
showed that HCL's prices for different sizes and types of dry core cables
range from 14% below to about 5% above the lowest foreign tender (CIF value)
depending upon the number of pairs and the conductor weight. For coaxial
cables (which is a small part of total production), the price for the
small tube (174 type) was 17.7% below and for the large tube (375 type)
18.6% above the international (CIF) prices. The custom tariff on imported
dry core cables is 75.5% and on coaxial cables 102.7%. HCL pays approxi-
mately 25% in custom tariffs on the imported raw materials, all of which
are obtained through methods of international procurement normally employed
by factories.
Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL)
12.       This factory, which is wholly Government-owned, commenced opera-
tions in 1960 under a collaboration agreement with Olivetti of Italy.
It has now developed manufacture to a stage of relative independence of
the collaborator on whom it relies only for special tools and a few piece
parts amounting to less than 4% of sales value. Staff currently numbers
1,100 and output in 1971/72 was 4,800 teleprinter units with spares,
with a value of Rs33.5 million.
13.       Production is made up of page teleprinters for Telex use, tape
teleprinters for use in P&T's public telegraph system, printing perfora-
tors, tape transmitters and other usual ancillary items. P&T buys 60%
of the factory's output, the balance going to other public sector users
in India and to a fast growing export market. Production is kept in line
with the demands for teleprinters. During the five-year program, P&T
will order 10,000 machines with spare parts to the value of Rs99.7 million
(US$13.7 million equivalent).
14.       There has been a progressive reduction in the foreign exchange
content of production. During 1969/70 local production of teleprinter
motors was introduced along with other items, representing a saving of
Rs818,000 annually in foreign exchange. Reimbursement under the existing
loan/credit is 9% of the value of goods delivered to P&T; for the pro-
posed credit, this will be reduced to 6%. This compares with a foreign
exchange content of 50% in 1964. In addition to the special tools and
piece parts which are still obtained from Olivetti, small quantities of
non-standard steel stock and other specialized material continue to be
purchased at least cost from this source, which was originally settled
upon after competitive international tendering, at a rate fixed at that
time.  For other items, whether imported or locally obtained, international
or local tenders are called.



ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 6 pages
15.       The company is an efficient production unit which continues to
improve its financial position, paying a 12.5% dividend in 1972. It has
also secured export orders to various countries including Singapore,
Lebanon, Iran, Ceylon and Nepal. HTL's prices to P&T are below the low-
est CIF price at which any teleprinter could be landed in India. P&T
would pay a 50% customs tariff were it to import teleprinters.
The P&T Departmental Workshops
16.       The three P&T workshops manufactures go almost entirely to P&T.
Production is debited at actual cost which includes depreciation of pro-
duction facilities. For 1971/72 the total value of production was about
Rs71 million in the Calcutta, Jabalpur and Bombay shops.
17.       The production consists of galvanized tubular steel poles, arms
and line hardware; switchboards, relays racks and power supplies for
manual telephone exchanges, private branch exchanges and long distance
exchanges, coin-in-slot telephones and many miscellaneous items.
18.       In the Five-Year program, manufacture to the value of approxi-
mately Rs772 million (US$106 million equivalent) from the workshops are
included in P&T's expansion of capital plant. The value for the first
two years of the five-year plan will be about Rs236 million (US$32.4
million equivalent) with a US$7.2 million foreign exchange. Procurement
of requirements of the workshops is by full competitive international
tendering.
19.       Direct comparison between the cost of production by the workshops
and international prices is not generally possible because most of the
items produced have been specially developed for local conditions. For
those items where direct comparison can be made, such as cable distribution
cabinets and terminals recently put into production, prices are below the
CIF price of equivalent items previously imported.

POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS DEPARTMENT (P&T)
TELECOMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
Notes on Demand Forecast Methodology
1.        In attempting to determine a realistic picture of unsatisfied
demand, P&T in 1971 required a reregistration and payment of a fee of
RslO from all applicants for telephone service. As a consequence the wait-
ing list was lowered from 415,000 to 310,000.
2.        In order for P&T to forecast telephone demand to form a planning
base for the Fifth Five-Year Plan, including long-term management decisions
for providing manufacturing capacity of telecommunications equipment, a
working group was appointed consisting of P&T and Planning Commission
members. The working group made comprehensive studies in attempting to
forecast future telephone demand, the results of which are summarized
below. Two sets of demand projections were made;
- by a macro-economic regression model using telephone density
against per capita income; and
- by fitting linear/exponential time series to the data of individ-
ual regional telephone systems aggregating the micro-projections.
3.        While both these projections represent the chosen data segment
reasonably well, the future projections, where the assumptions of future
economic growth is involved, do not take into consideration the changing
economic scene but probably indicates the minimum requirements. The macro-
economic forecasts are, of course, affected by what pace of economic growth
is assumed. Economic forecast based on the forward-looking objectives of
the Government, may turn out to be over-optimistic; on the other hand a
forecast based on past actuals may prove over-pessimistic as it fails to
take into account the progressive building up of the economic infrastructure
and the growing potential for economic growth. It was therefore decided
that three sets of economic projections will first be made:
(a) Projection of national income based on past data (1954-1970);
(b) Projection of national income based on past data (1954-1970)
ignoring the abnormal years 1966-1968 when the income was
suppressed due to unusual droughts;
(c) Projection of national income from 1971 to 1979 by the objective
set by the Planning Commission up to the end of the Fifth Plan
period.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 2 of 3 pages
A set of low/medium/high telephone demand projection was then made by
using the macro-economic model (the parameters of which have already been
estimated from past data) and the above three sets of economic projections.
The results are briefly summarized as follows:
Projected Telephone Demand
as of March 31 (in thousands)
1971     1981     1986
Actual demand                          1,291
Sum of micro-projections               1,310    2,650    3,480
Low macro-economic projection          1,165    2,247    3,526
Medium macro-economic projection       1,340    2,778    4,478
High macro-economic projection         1,506    8,515
(in 1978-79)
4.        By comparing the results of the projections, the findings of the
working group was that the telephone demand is likely to be of the order
2.2 to 2.8 million in 1981 and 3.4 to 4.5 million in 1986. The actual
growth in telephone demand may however be significantly higher if the tempo
of economic growth is substantially raised as has been envisaged by the
Planning Commission. On the basis of this finding the P&T made the demand
projection shown in the attached table and chart, adopting for the purpose
of planning the sum of the micro-projections.
5.        This forecast is more conservative than the medium macro-economic
projection. It is definitely on the low side since (a) in the past years
the supply of telephoneswas lagging considerably behind the demand, (b) the
past demand used in these projections does not take into account the latent
demand at that time, and (c) the experience in other countries with similar
past performance would indicate that the rate of growth to meet the demand
must be significantly higher, of the order of about 14% per year.

Rate of Return
Project Period
1.        In calculating the financial rate of return, a study period has
been taken corresponding to the mean life of the various items of plant
making up the project, which is assumed to have a lifetime of 22 years.
Costs
2.        The estimated project costs include provisions for contingencies
but exclude the amount of related customs duties. The average rate of
customs duties on direct imports is 80% and on raw materials 25%.
3.        The life of telecommunications equipment varies.  Some equip-
ment will have longer lives than the project period of 22 years, while
others will be shorter and will need replacing in the project period.
Therefore a residual value as well as additional values have been esti-
mated and included in the construction cost stream, based on the following
assumed average lives of plant items:
Buildings                        40 years
Cable                            30 years
Exchanges                        25 years
Transmission equipment           12 years
Subscriber equipment             10 years
Research equipment               10 years
4.        Operating costs were estimated from the income statement by
assuming that operating expenses, excluding depreciation, per exchange
line added under the project are attributable to the project.
Revenues
5.        Estimates of subscriber deposits are based on the assumption
that the exchange fill relating to the subscribers connected under the
project will go up to 92%. Estimates of OYT payments are based on the
assumption that the number of OYT subscribers added under the project
will be 20% of total added subscribers.
6.        Local service revenues were estimated from the number of sub-
scribers connected due to the project. It is assumed that the exchange
fill relating to the lines installed under the project would reach 92%.

7.        Toll revenues were estimated on the basis of the number of long
distance channels to be installed under the project and taking into account
additional traffic growth because of STD stimulus.

Rate of Return
8.        The financial rate of return is at least 13%, based on this study
which equates the present worth of the project's construction costs (exclud-
ing customs duties) and operating costs (excluding depreciation) to the
present worth of the attributable revenues, including subscriber deposits
and OYT payments.

9.        If a shadow price of foreign exchange of RslO to US$1 is used
in the calculation, while labor is valued at 50% of actual disbursements,
the rate of return on the project becomes 12%. If a sensitivity analysis
is applied to this estimate the following results are obtained:
Rate of Return
10% increase in construction costs                     10%
10% increase in operating costs                        11%
10% increase in operating revenues                     14%
10% increase in construction costs with
10% increase in operating costs and
10% decrease in revenue growth from

ANNEX 14
Page 1 of 4 pages
INDIA
POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS DEPARTMENT (P&T)
TELECOMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
Financial Reorganization
A. BACKGROUND
The finances of the Telecommunications Branch, as part of P&T's
finances, form part of the national budget and are subject to control of
the parliamentary grant system (see below). The accounts under this system
are primarily a record of cash receipts and payments and do not provide for
a balance sheet or profit and loss statement in the commercial sense. Be-
fore the financial reorganization, the Branch's accountirg function was
carried out by an outside body, the Comptroller and Auditor General's
Department. Consequently, whatever accounting information was received
by the Directorate of P&T was either insufficient or too late for any
prompt appropriate action to be taken.
The Government of India agreed with IDA to employ consultants
to assist in reviewing the accounting procedures of the Telecommunications
Branch. The firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. was retained in July 1964
and they submitted their report in May 1965. The main recommendations were
the establishment of an accounting staff with internal controls and audit
within and under control of the P&T, and the reorganization of the exist-
ing accounting system along commercial lines. Both recommendations were
accepted in principle by the Government of India. A Presidential Order
dated March 1, 1968, provided for the separation of the accounts of the
Telecommunications Branch from the Comptroller and Auditor General.
B. PARLIAMENTARY GRANT SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTING AS IT RELATES TO P&T
Traditionally, a parliamentary grant system of accounting is
designed for Government departments financed out of a general pool of
Government revenue. The primary purpose is to ensure that no money is
spent contrary to the intention of the legislature. This places the
emphasis on the control of cash with little regard for operating results.
Under the parliamentary grant system, P&T's expenditures require
sanction by the Ministry of Finance, and examination by the Comptroller
and Auditor General. Parliamentary control is global without a basis for
interference into P&T's day-to-day operations, and is limited to three
basic votes: (i) P&T working expenses; (ii) dividends (interest on
capital-at-charge) paid Government and appropriation to reserve funds;
(iii) capital outlay. Within each of the three categories, the P&T
Board, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance (through the Member



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 4 pages
Finance), has considerable powers to allocate funds between headings and
sub-headings without specific parliamentary approval.
C. PRESENT STATUS OF FINANCIAL REORGANIZATION
The Government of India has taken important steps which will lead
to the establishment of commercial accounting for the Telecommunications
Branch. The start and subsequent pace of implementation of the consultants'
recommendations was slow owing to lengthy deliberation by Government and the
conceptual and administrative problems involved.
P&T has made good progress with its financial reorganization
according to agreed stipulations and time schedules, following closely the
recommendations of its consultants, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. The
following summarizes the progress and status of the Branch's financial
reorganization.
Transfer of the Branch's accounting function from the Comptroller and
Auditor General (C&AG) to P
The transfer was completed on schedule as of September 1, 1970.
This was a major change in the Government structure requiring Cabinet
approval and affecting some 1,800 government employees. The transfer was
effected region by region and was phased over a 2--year period.
Audit of commercial accounts by C&AG
The commercial accounts are being audited each year by the C&AG.
Commercial accounts are being submitted to Parliament
Commercial accounts are being prepared and submitted to Parliament
together with the appropriation accounts and a reconciliation statement.
This practice will continue for the foreseeable future with increasing
emphasis and reliance expected to be placed on the more informative commer-
cial accounts.
Asset register
The Branch is maintaining a fixed asset register on a global
basis showing the main categories of plant and their value. Depreciation
is being recorded based on the estimated life of the assets. An attempt
is now going to be made to establish the value of assets by region in order
to eventually be able to evaluate each region's operating results.
A system of double entry accounting
A system of double entry accounting has been recently established
in each of the accounting units. This is one of the prerequisites for being
able to establish the operating results by region.



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 4 pages
Internal Audit
There is an internal audit group based at each circle/district
that performs the internal audit of the circle/district and of each division
under the circle/district.
Periodic reviews of the lives of telecommunications plant to ensure that
book lives are kept in line with achieved lives
A standing committee with the following members was constituted
for recommending the lives to be assigned for the various categories of
assets.
Deputy Director General: Stores and Maintenance
Long Distance
Efficiency Bureau
Deputy Chief Engineer:    Telegraph
Director of Accounts
Director of Finance II
Work registers (cost sheets)
Each division is maintaining a works register (cost sheet) for
each work showing number of manhours and value of material used.
Materials management
P&T is at the stage of implementing their consultants' recommend-
ations for improving the materials management system.
Billing and collection
Pursuant to recommendations of a committee studying ways to
improve the billing and collection procedures, the billing function for
Bombay, Calcutta, New Delhi and Madras, the four largest telecommunica-
tion centers in India, are to be computerized. In the other smaller units
new simplified and improved manual billing and collection procedures are
being introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the committee.
Delegation of financial responsibility
With completion of the transfer of the accounting function to
P&T and the assignment of a financial adviser and accounting staff to each
of the circles/districts, a greater measure of financial responsibility now
rests with the lower levels. It is planned to further delegate financial
responsibility as follows: budget preparation and review of proposals,
and more detailed accounting information at the division level. Circles/
districts have also been given greater financial authority to incur both
revenue and capital expenditures.



ANNEX 14
Page h of 4 pages
The circle/district as an intermediate accounting unit
As each circle/district was taken over, an accounting staff,
headed by a financial adviser, was established to be responsible for
finances. And now with the completion of the accounting function transfer,
the circle/district has become an intermediate accounting unit with the
financial adviser directly responsible to the circle/district head and
functionally responsible to the Director of Accounts at Directorate
Headquarters.
Training programs
In order to meet the increased requirement for additional and
better qualified financial staff, as a result of the financial reorganiza-
tion, P&T has established training programs for various levels of its
financial staff, including new recruits. The programs consist of super-
vised, on-the-job training and outside study with the individual required
to pass an examination at the end of the training period.
Separate P&T finance service
A separate P&T finance service has recently been formally estab-
lished within Government entitled "P&T Accounts and Finance Service".
This means that the P&T finance service will have its own personnel assigned
full time rather than on secondments from other services and will be able
to recruit directly through competitive examination conducted by the Union
Public Service Conmnission as for other all-India services of GOI. This is
timely, coinciding with the P&T taking over its accounting function and
will serve to strengthen the P&T in all aspects of its broadening financial
responsibilities.
Performance budget
P&T has recently begun publishing a performance budget to be
submitted as a supplement to the conventional budget, which will show the
physical accomplishment against the physical plan. Although this is a
first attempt for P&T and initially may not be more than an exercise, it
can become meaningful as a gauge to measure work performance and is a step
in P&T's long-range plans to operate along commercial lines.

Notes  cm'd  s.j'jti1ns on the Balance Sheet
Plant in Service and M=eprciaLvon
1         The presen book valu. of fixed assets is based on historical
cost.  The Branch has _orled and is  in taiing a fixed asset register
showing the main categoriee  of plant and their value beginning with fiscal
year 1925J26. Depreciation has been recorded based on the estimated life
of the assets, and write-offs have been made on the basis of the assumed
life of the assets regardless of the actual life. The composite rate of
depreciation, including supplementary depreciation, on average gross
plant in service is about 5.5%, which is reasonable.  As provided in
Development Credit Agreement 241-IN, whenever appropriate, and in any case
at least every five years, a review will be made of the value of net fixed
assets in operation and the rate of depreciation to determine whether,
because of substantial changes in current prices, adjustments to such
values are required. Also, confirmation was obtained that periodic reviews
of the telecommunications plant will be made by engineers and accountants
to ensure that book lives of assets are kept in line with achieved lives.
Plant Under Construction
2.        In the forecast it is assumed that the amount of plant under
construction each year will be the sum of 50% of the construction program
of the previous year pluz 1001 of the construction program of the current
year.
Cash
3.        No cash balance is shown since P&T does not retain any cash of
its own. As a Government department all revenues of P&T are required to
be paid into the Governrmern's consolidated fLud.
Subscriber Accounts Receivable
4.        Over the years the amount of subscribers  accounts receivable
has been substantial, amounting in some years to three months of total
annual operating revenues. Attention is being given to this matter and
the amount of receivables is being reduced to a more reasonable level.
The forecasts assume that for the next six years subscriber accounts
receivables, including a number of old accounts receivables some of which
will eventually be written off, will amount to about eight weeks' billings.
Inventories
5.        Inventories in stock at the stores and workshops, work in prog-
ress at the workshops and certain goods in transit comprise the total
amount of inventories. The forecasts assume the value of inventories to
be Rs145 per DEL at year end, based on past experience.

Funds with Government
6.        Funds with Government consist of funds transferred by the Branch
and held by Government to cover any shortfall the Branch may have in meet-
ing its interest payments on capital-at-charge. The accumulated amount
held by Government is deducted from capital-at-charge in calculating the
interest due from the Branch on its capital-at-charge. Forecasts show no
further transfers beginning in 1975 because the accumulated amount is suf-
ficient to cover any shortfall.
Capital-at-Charge Representing Central Government Contributions;
Reserves (Equity)
7.        In constructing the balance sheet for the commercial accounts,
capital-at-charge is divided between (i) Central Government contributions,
which with reserves would in a commercial sense be considered equity;
and (ii) long-term debt in foreign exchange, which together with a repay-
able Government loan would be considered long-term debt. Reserves consist
of the accumulated net profit (retained earnings) transferred annually
from the income statement, and the annual supplementary depreciation trans-
fers (see paragraph 6.10).
Government Loan
8.        This loan was made in 1968 to the Branch in order to allow inter-
est payments to be met on Central Government contributions. The shortage
that year was due to the Branch transferring funds to the Postal Branch.
Capital-at-Charge Representing Long-Term Debt in Foreign Exchange
9.        The amount of capital-at-charge representing long-term debt in
foreign exchange made available by Government includes previous Bank/IDA
borrowings, a former CIDA credit, and small amounts of foreign exchange and
bilateral aid. The cash budget accounts treat foreign exchange loans made
available by Government as part of the Central Government contribution
which in turn is treated as non-repayable loans. The Branch is not required
to amortize these long-term debts, but pays Government annual interest of
6-3/4%.
10.       New borrowings by Government for the project are as follows:
(a) CIDA credit of US$11 million equivalent at no interest or com-
mitment charge and a term of 50 years, including a 10-year
grace period.
(b) Hungarian Government credit of US$6 million equivalent at
2% annual interest and a term of 10 years, including one
year of grace.



ANNEX 1 6
Page 4 of 4 pages
(c) Proposed IDA credit of US$80 million equivalent at usual IDA
credit terms.
(d)  Fature borrowings of US$4 million on soft terms.
Accounts Payable
11.       The amount of accounts payable is not large since under the
parliamentary grant system any payments not made may not be charged
against the current grant and will lapse. Forecasts assume that the
amount of accounts payable to increase by 10% annually, in line with
past experience.
Revenue Received in Advance
12.       Revenue received in advance is mainly for rental charges paid
quarterly in advance. Forecasts are based on past experience and show
an annual increase of about 7%.
Subscriber Deposits
13.       This is a guarantee deposit instituted in 1968 and pertains to
non-CYT subscribers in measured rate areas. This deposit is refundable
at the time service is surrendered.
Deferred Credit
14.       In order to augment funds for capital expansion, a scheme known
as "Own Your Telephone" (OYT) was put into effect in 1949 whereby a sub-
scriber by paying a lump sum as advance rental would receive preference
in obtaining telephone service. The subscriber in effect recoups his
advance payment in 20 years by paying a lesser rate for telephone service.
Under the plan, the subscriber is entitled to a refund if he disconnects
his service. There have been, however, scarcely any disconnections of
OYT service.

Notes and Assumptions on Income Statements
Telephone Revenue
Local rental and call charges, including STD have been forecast
on the basis of planned average increase in connections and traffic forecasts.
Installation fees have been forecast on the basis of the estimated
number of telephones to be-installed during the year, including reconnections
and shifting of telephones.
Trunk and international revenue have been conservatively estimated
to increase at about 2% per annum, taking into account the diversion of
manually switched traffic to STD.
Telegraph Revenue
Domestic revenue has been assumed to increase at about 5% annually,
taking into account the expected diversion of domestic telegraph traffic to
telex and STD.
International revenue is forecast to increase at Rs2 million per
year, similar to the past.
Telex Revenue
Forecasts are based on the average number of telex connections
expected to be working each year plus a nominal increase of 5% due to traffic
growth.
Railway Communications
Railway revenue is forecast to remain at Rs4O million annually
based on estimated future usage.
Miscellaneous
Revenue from miscellaneous sources such as directory advertising,
fees from broken instruments and sale of scrap are estimated to increase
by Rs3 million annually, based on past experience.
Expenses
Staff expenses and other costs of operation have been forecast
to increase on the basis of planned increase in direct exchange lines,
but taking into account increased system automation as well as assumed
increases in wages and cost-of-living allowances.
Depreciation, including supplementary depreciation, has been
computed on a straight-line basis, based on the life of the various cate-
gories of plant in service, and results in a composite rate of 5~9 on
average gross fixed assets in service.



ANNEX 17
Page 3 of 3 pages
Postal Transfers
The Telecommunications Branch reflects in its accounts the amount
of the annual Postal Branch's loss that it subsidizes. Although the transfer
of funds from Telecommunications to Postal is notional, the amount of the
postal loss unfavorably influences,the amount of funds allocated by GOI for
telecommunications development. Over the past four years Postal losses sub-
sidized by Telecommunications amounted to Rs536 million, about 25% of the
Telecommunication Branch's net operating income for the same period. Fore-
casts assume annual transfers of Rs75 million plus interest earned on the
accumulated amount. The Postal Branch does not operate at a loss as a
matter of policy, according to the Senior Member Finance, rather it occurs
as a result of delays in obtaining postal rate increases.
Funds with Government
Funds with Government consist of funds transferred by the Branch
and held by Government to cover any shortfall the Branch might have in
meeting its interest payments on capital-at-charge. The accumulated amount
of these funds is deducted from capital-at-charge in calculating interest
due from the Government on its capital-at-charge.

POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS DEPARTMENT (P&T)
TELECOMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
Fiscal Impact of the Branch's Operations 1974-1979
1.        The fiscal impact of the Telecommunications Branch's operations
on Government will be favorable. During the period 1974-79 Government
will benefit by accruing funds in the amount of Rs3,813 million as a
result of the Branch's operations; this compares with funds accruing to
the Branch from Government amounting to Rs4,059 million as shown below:
Funds accruing to Government                               Rs Million
Postal Branch subsidy                                      637
Transfers to Government fund                               339
Interest on capital-at-charge                            1,984
Custom duties                                              853
Total                                      3,813
Funds accruing to the Branch from Government
Central Government contributions as equity               3,820
Debt service on foreign exchange loans                     231
Total                                      4,o51
Net funds accruing to the Branch             238
2.        The Branch is providing, as a part of the program, subsidy housing
for staff costing Rsl,449 million.  This expenditure can be construed as a
further contribution to Government in the sense that this would reduce
Government's investment for subsidizing housing as part of its overall
policy. The total benefits accruing to Government, when including the
housing subsidy, amounts to about 130% of Government's contribution to
the Branch during the 197h-79 period.
