CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         People's Republic of Mozambique
Beneficiaries:    Ministry of Finance (MF); Bank of Mozambique (BM); Ministry of Industry
and Energy (MIE); and selected major beneficiary enterprises (BEs).
Amount:            SDR 40 million (US$50.1 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity
Qending
Terms:           Government will pass on US$50.1 million equivalent of the IDA Credit to
the BM to: (a) channel US$39.9 million equivalent to BEs under the
Enterprise Restructuring Component (ERC); and (b) retain US$10.2 million
equivalent for technical assistanea to strengthen the Enterprise
Restructuring Technical Unit (ERTU) and other agencies involved in the
Project, for consultancies to BEs for subproject preparation, and for
training. The ERC would be channelled to BEs primarily as loans through
BM.   However,  in appropriate cases,  the Government could use this
component to make direct equity investments in BEs in combination with
loans according to their assessed needs for financial restructuring.
The BM would onlend the credit proceeds under the ERG in local currency
to eligible BEs at adjustable interest rates based on the structure of
rates prevailing in Mozambique, The credit risk on onlending would be
borne by the BM who would receive an appropriate spread as determined
by the banking system. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
Government and would be covered by the interest yield on funds onlent,
net of the service charge on the IDA credit, and the onlending spread
of the BM. The Government would bear the risk on any equity investments.
Subloans under the ERC would have a maturity of up to 15 years, including
up to a 5-year grace period.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
ON AN INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Mozambique for SDR 40 million (US$50.1 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help to finance an industrial enterprise
restructuring project. The project is expected to be co-financed by Italy for
US$22.5 million equivalent.
2.          Background.   After  independence  in 1975 Mozambique's  industry
encountered serious problems through: (a) the departure of many enterprise owners
and almost all skilled manpower which obliged the new Government to take control
of over 300 enterprises, many neglected and with debt arrears; (b) the adverse
security situation after 1980, which led to a severe drop in export earnings and
an acute scarcity of foreign exchange for imports oi industrial inputs; and (c)
control of exchange rates, interest rates, product prices, production and
distribution under  the central  plan  These  factors  resulted  in currency
overvaluation and major domestic market distortions and the build up of the
fiscal deficit and external debt. As a result, 1986 industrial output fell to
abDut 45% of that of 1980, with widespread disinvestment and excess capacity.
Enterprises were affected by: (a) obsolescence, mechanical breakdown, serious
shortages of replacements and spare parts, and war-related damage to plant and
equipment; and (b) mounting enterprise losses, liquidity and capitalization
problems.
3.          Government Objectives and Strategy.   Since 1987 the Government has
been addressing the economic distortions and structural constraints through a
comprehensive Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP). Government objectives for
industry under the ERP are: (a) to rehabilitate directly a selected group of
larger-scale enterprises; and (b) to create a supportive environment for
development and rehabilitation of small and medium enterprises, requiring
restoration of the banks' capacity to mobilize deposits and conduct appraisal-
based lending. This Project focusses on objective (a) while a parallel project,
the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Project, would address objective (b).
Under the ERP, Government strategy for industry has included:   (a) currency
devaluation (which has reduced real wages), and opening up of foreign exchange
allocation; (b) price and distribution decontrol; (c) investment promotion
through foreign and domestic investment codes, an exchange retention scheme, and
corporate tax and tariff reforms; and (d) increased private sector participation,
management autonomy and accountability.  Out of approximately 300 enterprises
initially intervened by the Government during 1975-77, about 140 have been
returned  to private  interests.    A UNDP-financed,  Bank-executed,  Business
Environment Study made a series of recommendations in terms of the design of
fiscal and monetary incentives for industry, industrial subsector efficiency,
and the development of industrial finance.  The report endorsed the general
direction of policy reform in the sector a: it is currently being implemented.
4.          A series of sector constraints must be addressed if the industrial
sector is to be able to respond fully to the opportunity presented by the more
favorable policy environment. A review of 40 major enterprises (representative
of the enterprise sector), undertaken as part of the preparation work for the
Project highlighted: (a) the poor condition of infrastructure and industrial
plant; (b) severe skilled personnel shortages; (c) weak financial positions of



*  2  -
mnny enterprises due to accumulated 1ossen and debt; (d) an uncertain corporate
legal framework; and (e) lack of an institutional framework and capacity within
Government and enterprises to plan and implement rehabilitation programs.  The
Government with support from IDA has begun to address these issues by:   (a)
setting up an Enterprise Restructuring Technical Unit (ERTU) in 1988 at tho
Ministry of Finance to provide the institutional framework to co-ordinate the
overall rehabilitation program and be responsible for implementation of the
proposed Project; (b) preparing rehabilitation and restructuring plans for major
enterprises on a case-by-case basis: and (c) initiating a study of the legal
ownership status of intervened enterprises.   The Business Environment Study
identified several subsectors for in-depth review, includinS the edible oils,
textiles and garments, metal-working and packaging.
5.          Rationa for IDA Involvement.  The Project is an important vehicle
for supporting the Government's strategy to resuscitate industrial production
in the context of the ERP. IDA's involvement, through general policy dialogue,
three rehabilitation credits and several project-based investment credits, has
contributed significantly in shaping the Government's strategy and in priority
setting under the ERP. IDA's further involvement through this Project will help
broaden and deepen the recovery program and is viewed by the Government as
necessary to sustain the momentum of reform and generate an adequate supply
response. It will also encourage other donors (many of whom have already given
strong support to the ERP) to support these efforts in a well-coordinated manner.
Industrial sector support mainly through short-term commodity aid has already
been provided by Sweden, UK, Italy, Norway and other bilateral agencies, and by
the African Development Bank.
6.          Qkb1etives.  The Project's overall objective, which is in support
of the Government's strategy, is to restore production and efficiency in a
selected group of major industrial and agro-industrial enterprises.   More
specifically, the Project aims to: (a) introduce a framework and criteria for
selecting enterprises for rehabilitation based on each enterprise's potential
economic, financial and technical viability, and on its management capacity to
operate efficiently and profitably; (b) finance the rehabilitation, financial
restructuring and operational support to selected enterprises. The restructuring
process would, where appropriate, include rationalization of capacity,
privatization, technical partnership arrangements, or if necessary, closure of
nonviable operations; (c) protect the environment and worker safety by requiring
that each BE introduce measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants and
provide  a  safe  working  environment  for  their workers;    (d)  strengthen
Government's capacity to implement the rehabilitation program; and (e) support
policy reforms and subsector reviews designed to strengthen enterprise operations
in a market-oriented environment.
7.          Proiect Descrigtion.  The Project will have two components.   The
Enterprise Rehabilitation Comoonent (EfiCa would be channelled through the Bank
of Mozambique, for the rehabilitation, financial restructuring, and operational
support of about fifteen existing priority enterprises that are potentially
viable. Rehabilitation would cover replacement or modernization of equipment
and provision of spare parts, raw material inventories and operational support
to strengthen enterprise management.   Financial restructuring would involve
restructuring for those enterprises that have been selected for rehabilitation
and currently face financial difficulties. Restructuring would be accomplished
through a combination of the following: recapitalization, conversion of debt into
equity, injection of new equity, and, where appropriate, through divestiture or
joint venture arrangements with foreign and local private investors.   In all



- 3-
cases,  the prospects for privatization would be carefully reviewed.   IDA
resources would be channelled to BEs primarily as loans, however, in appropriate
cases the Government could use the ERC to make direct equity investments in BEs,
in combination with loans according to the financial restructuring needs of the
enterprise. The needs of each individual enterprise and its potential viability
would be identified through detailed studies, from which a rehalilitation plan,
financial plan and implementation timetable would be developed. Prefeasibility
studies (initially financed through a PPF advance) for all the fifteen potential
beneficiary enterprises and some design studies were completed in mid-1989.
All subprojects to be financed under the ERC would be subject to review by the
ERTU and prior approval by IDA.   The Technical Assistance Cc ponent would
comprise:    (a)  financing experts  and consultancy services  to strengthen
Government's capacity to implement the overall rehabilitation program. Advisory
support would be provided to the ERTU (initially financed through a PPF advance)
to strengthen its capacity to manage implementation of the Project; (b) financing
the consultancy costs of feasibility studies, developing rehabilitation plans
and operational technical assistance to potential BEs. The experts assigned to
the ERTU would organize training for enterprise management, banks and relevant
Government agencies in project appraisal, supervision and preparation of
enterprise rehabilitation and restructuring plans; and (c) conducting subsector
and policy studies.   Technical assistance will also be provided to assist
enterprises in developing training programs for re-deployed staff and in
financing tools and equipment for such staff who may wish to start businesses
of their own.
8.          Total Project costs are estimated at US$106.7 million equivalent,
including US$71.2 million in foreign currency (67%). A breakdown of costs and
a financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and status of Bank Group operations
in Mozambique are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7826-MOZ dated November 21, 1989, is also attached.
9.          Actions Agreed.  At negotiations, the following main agreements were
reached with the Government: (a) the subsector studies would be completed by
December 31, 1991, and an action program based on the recommendations of the
studies, and agreed with IDA, would be carried out by March 31, 1993; (b) the
economic, financial and technical eligibility criteria to be used for BEs and
subprojects, and subloan and investment processing procedures; (c) the onlending
terms, including agreement on interest rates (in accordance with Government's
program to achieve positive rates by 1990); (d) Government assuming the foreign
exchange risk; and (e) Government would, with IDA support, formulate an action
plan by December 31, 1990 to determine the legal ownership status of intervened
enterprises, and would promptly thereafter take all necessary legal and
administrative  measures  to  implement  the  plan.    Conditions  of  credit
effectiveness would be:   (a) the signing of the subsidiary administration
agrecment between the Government and BM; and (b) appointment of an accountant
to the ERTU. Other conditions: (a) all subloans and equity investments would
require prior IDA approval; (b) financing of training programs for laid-off staff
would require prior IDA approval; and (c) a model Subloan Agreement to be
approved by IDA and the appointment of a Procurement advisor would be conditions
of disbursement for the ERC.
10.         Benefits.   Rehabilitation of selected major enterprises will yield
high economic returns through restoration of employment and higher levels of
production and incomes. Improvements in the institutional and policy framework,



.4.
plus increased enterprLse autonemy and competition, with more private sector
Involvement through joint ventures and divestiture, should enhance enterprise
efficiency and profitability.   The rehabilitation,  financial restructuring,
privatization and technical nanagement approaches developed for enterprlies under
the Project will serve as demonatration cases for the design and implementation
of similar prcgrams in other enterprises.  Further, the Project will aim to
increase the market orientation of enterprises through improvements In fit cial
and management information sy&.;ems, with emphasis on accurate record keeping,
cost controls and related training of enterprise personnel.
11.         Rlks. The major risks assoolated with the Project stem from: (a)
the economy's fragility and therefore the possibility that political and social
opposition may weaken Government's commitment to the WEP reform program during
Project implementation, particularly the more sensitive changes (e.g. price
liberalization and state enterprise divestiture or liquidations) which represent
a significant departure from past policies; (b) limited Government and enterprise
experience in implementing rehabilitation plans; and (c) the security situation,
which may adversely affect project implementation. To mitigate these risks:
(a) the Project would provide assistance in training and financing tools and
equipment for laid-off staff in order to alleviate the social costs and,
therefore, reduce the risk of resistance on the part of the public; and (b) 3Es
will be selected primarily on the basis: of their potential economic, technical
and financial viability; that they possess a capable management team or plans
are made to secure such a team; and that their operations are not seriously
affected by the security situation. The ERTU is being strengthened through the
services of an experienced consulting firm and enterprise management will also
be strengthened and, where necessary, assisted in formulating and implementing
their rehabilitation plans. Close supervision during Project implementation will
be maintained to deal with problems as they arise to ensure that the environment
is not adversely affected by the operations of BEs. Government commitment to,
and progress so far in, implementing the reform program has been encouraging and
no evidence exists of flagging Government resolve.
12.         R.agadation  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of IDA and recomLend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
