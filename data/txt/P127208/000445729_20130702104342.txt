                              REPUBLIC OF HAITI
                    ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH
                         DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT

Recipient             Republic of Haiti
Implementing Agency   Ministry of Economy and Finance
Financing Data        IDA Grant in the amount of SDR13.3 million (US$20 million
                      equivalent)
Operation Type        Stand-alone operation, single tranche
Main Policy Areas     As Haiti transitions from post-earthquake emergency to addressing
                      long standing weaknesses in economic governance, the goal of the
                      proposed Grant is to enhance transparency and efficiency of
                      public resources management in support of physical
                      reconstruction and institutional consolidation for long term
                      growth through improving: (i) public financial management through
                      better budget execution and cash management; (ii) the institutional
                      framework and capacity for effective public procurement; and (iii)
                      governance and performance in the electricity sector. Despite being
                      a single tranche operation, the proposed Grant builds on a
                      continuum of operations that began in 2005. This single tranche
                      approach allows the Bank to remain pragmatic and able to seize
                      opportunities to support progress in areas needing timely attention
                      from the authorities. The series of development policy operations
                      (DPOs) helped lay the basic foundations of sound public financial
                      management, transparency, procurement practices and electricity
                      sector governance, and were followed during the post-earthquake
                      emergency phase with support for securing economic management
                      quality in the face of significantly weakened institutions, data, and
                      domestic resources. The proposed operation aims to consolidate the
                      efforts under the Emergency DPO and return the focus to structural
                      reforms.
Key Outcome           The following outcomes are expected to be achieved by the closing
Indicators            of the proposed Grant in June 2014:

                      Public Financial Management
                      Strengthen public investment tracking and cash management
                      systems: (i) the Directorate of Public Investment publishes quarterly
                      budget execution reports that provide accurate information about
                      domestically-financed public investment (including data on
                      PetroCaribe resources) beyond the commitment stage with
                      information covering line ministries and by project; (ii) the number
                      of accounts for each ministry has been reduced to three accounts at
                      the Central Bank: a current account for operations, an investment
                      account, and a revenue account, representing a key step toward the
                      establishment of a Single Treasury Account.

                                             i
Key Outcome           Procurement
Indicators            Establish a transparent institutional framework for procurement and
                      upgrade procurement management capacity: (i) not less than two-
                      thirds of public procurement contracts above the prior-review
                      threshold signed after March 31, 2013, and outside of periods of
                      Emergency Law, are the result of competitive or limited bidding,
                      using standard bidding documents; (ii) all procuring ministries have
                      submitted their FY14 procurement plans to the procurement
                      regulator CNMP by October 31, 2013; (iii) ministerial procurement
                      units submit quarterly reports to CNMP on all procurement activity
                      in their ministries; and (iv) US$11M originally allocated to the 5
                      cancelled contracts were freed up for reallocation to other
                      investments.

                      Electricity Sector Performance
                      Enhance governance and financial performance of the Electricity
                      sector: (i) payment of independent power producers’ bills is based
                      on production levels measured by remote meters and verified by the
                      national electricity utility EDH; (ii) EDH billing of priority
                      customers is based on meter readings; and (iii) no new arrears by the
                      Central Government to EDH for electricity consumption are
                      accumulated.
Program Development   The proposed Development Policy Grant supports the
Objective and         Government of Haiti’s program of sustainable reconstruction
Contribution to ISN   and growth. In particular, the Grant supports institution building,
                      and the strengthening of economic governance in sectors critical to
                      reconstruction and growth in the short and medium term. The
                      proposed Grant supports the following key outcomes of the ISN: (a)
                      improvements to the commercial viability of the electricity sector,
                      (b) improved transparency, accountability and efficiency of public
                      resource use, and (c) the continuation of the Government’s
                      economic reform program and the transfer of resources to the
                      Haitian budget in the event of a financing gap. The supported
                      actions build on previous reforms, together comprising a
                      programmatic reform agenda. At the same time, the single tranche
                      format allows the flexibility required to capitalize on reform
                      opportunities when they arise.

                      The proposed operation is well integrated into the bundle of
                      activities supported by the Bank in Haiti. In particular, the proposed
                      Grant is complemented by technical assistance through an
                      Institutional Strengthening project (in the PFM and procurement
                      areas) and an Electricity Sector capacity support project. The Grant
                      is also consistent with the joint donor matrix elaborated by
                      Government and donors in the context of the Joint Budget Support
                      Group which the Bank has co-convened since 2005.


                                             ii
Risks and Mitigation   The proposed Grant takes place in a risky environment
                       characterized by weak governance, strong political pressures,
                       and inadequate institutional capacity. For this reason, expected
                       outcomes may not materialize. However, the risks are outweighed
                       by the potential gains from advancing critical institutional reforms
                       by the Government of Haiti. First, the reforms supported by this
                       Grant have the potential to be transformational by laying the
                       groundwork for strong economic governance systems as the country
                       transitions from post-disaster response to a medium-term
                       development framework. Second, these reforms are likely to be
                       sustainable as they bring about institutional changes that are not
                       easily reversed. Third, with the potential decline in external aid
                       resources, strengthening Haiti’s public resource management
                       systems supported by this operation becomes even more important
                       for mobilizing adequate resources to finance development programs.

                       Political risks may interrupt the Government’s reform program,
                       and/or weaken reform implementation. While there may still be
                       risks of political turnover or stalemate in the future, the resignation
                       of the Minister of Finance in April 2013 did not lead to any
                       interruption in the Government’s programs as her successor
                       immediately committed to continuing the reform program under
                       way. With respect to transparency and economic governance, the
                       pressure on policymakers to deliver quick results after occurrence of
                       natural disasters may lead to continued reliance on exceptional rules
                       and Emergency Laws for procuring large public contracts. The
                       Government’s commitment to key reforms – such as through
                       increased transparency in public contracting (making all contracts
                       public), providing the necessary resources and training to ensure the
                       effective functioning of line ministries’ programming and analysis
                       units (UEPs) and procurement commissions, ex-post review of
                       contracts passed under the 2012-13 Emergency Law, comprehensive
                       review and reform of EDH functions, and other reforms agreed in
                       the joint donor matrix – would help to mitigate these risks. This in
                       turn would help to keep the reform momentum and ownership high
                       and generate a more visible development impact.

                       Weak institutional capacity may result in poor observance of
                       governance principles in public finance management and
                       procurement, and may reduce the effectiveness of electricity sector
                       reforms. Haiti’s public sector institutions continue to suffer from a
                       legacy of inefficient budget and fiscal management processes and

                        PROGRAM DOCUMENT
                          FOR A PROPOSED
    ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
                      TO THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI

                                 I.       INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

1.      This Program Document presents a proposed Development Policy Grant (DPG) to the
Republic of Haiti in the amount of SDR13.3 million (US$20 million equivalent). The proposed
Grant is the first DPG following the Emergency Budget Support Operation approved by the Board
in July 2010 in response to the January 2010 earthquake.

2.       The proposed Grant is a single-tranche operation that builds on the institutional
foundations laid under the past series of DPGs, some of which were stalled or reversed by the
earthquake. The earthquake increased the urgency to address Haiti’s deep structural problems of
weak economic governance and inefficient and nontransparent public resource use. The significant
inflow of reconstruction funds not only created pressure on the existing capacity to manage and use
funds, but also increased demand for better economic governance. In this context, the proposed
Grant will enhance transparency in the use and management of public investment resources,
improve cash management through streamlined public accounts, strengthen public procurement
institutions to enable them to implement effectively the Haiti’s Procurement Law, and enhance
electricity sector governance and performance by improving the transparency in electricity supply
and the accuracy and regularity of billing.

3.     As Haiti’s focus shifts from undertaking post-disaster emergency actions to implementing a
longer term development program, the proposed Grant aims to address structural bottlenecks that
hamper Haiti’s governance systems during post-earthquake reconstruction.

4.      The Grant provides resources to help the Government meet essential outlays in the
Haitian FY13 budget adopted by Parliament in September 2012.1 Since January 2010,
financing needs have increased significantly, exacerbated by extensive and challenging
reconstruction activities following the earthquake. Massive aid inflows since FY10 have helped the
Government respond to urgent needs and finance social and physical capital investments aimed at
placing Haiti on the path to economic recovery. Domestic revenue is increasing, but remains
insufficient to meet the Government’s financing requirements for reconstruction and growth.

5.      The Grant supports the Government’s strategy for reconstruction and development
outlined in the National Recovery and Development Action Plan (PARDH) of May 2010, as well as
the priorities for reconstruction articulated by the President of the Republic of Haiti in October
2011 and the current Government’s program of May 2012.

6.     The proposed Grant is an essential component of the World Bank Group’s program
for FY13-14 and is aligned with the cross-cutting governance themes of the Bank’s September
2012 Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The World Bank Group’s program of support aims to reduce
the vulnerability of Haitians, accelerate reconstruction, promote economic growth, foster private

sector development and improve governance. Measures taken in the context of the proposed DPG
directly complement IDA’s activities under a number of World Bank Group activities, including the
following investment operations: (i) the economic and governance activities of the Infrastructure
and Institutions Emergency Recovery Operation (approved in March 2010) and its subsequent
Additional Financing (approved in September 2012); (ii) the ongoing Electricity Loss Reduction
Project (PREPSEL) and the follow-up Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure and Access Project
(approved September 2012) aimed at reconstructing and expanding the power network, and
increasing electricity access as well as the transparency and efficiency of the sector; and (iii) the
Business Development and Investment Project and the Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Project,
both under preparation in support of private investment and growth, including outside of Port-au-
Prince. Annex 5 provides a summary of complementary knowledge services and convening
activities, reflecting the Bank’s extensive engagement in Haiti related to public resource
management and growth.

7.      The proposed Grant also complements the efforts of other partners involved in budget
support. Under a multi-donor coordination mechanism for budget support, a joint policy matrix
was drafted by the Government and the relevant development partners in May 2009, and updated in
January 2012. A revised matrix was agreed in May 2013 to reflect the current reform context. The
specific policies supported by the proposed Grant lie at the core of the comprehensive set of policy
reforms elaborated in the joint donor matrix aimed at strengthening economic governance and PFM
in particular.

                                 II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political and Security Developments
8.     After a lengthy electoral process that began in November 2010, Michel Joseph
Martelly was elected President in May 2011. This marked the first peaceful handover of power
from one democratically elected president to another from a different political party.

9.      The peaceful completion of the presidential election was seen by many as a sign of hope
for the reconstruction of the country after the devastating earthquake of January 2010. A year
after the earthquake, Haiti continued to face significant humanitarian challenges, with many
earthquake-affected camp residents remaining dependent on assistance for their basic survival.
Recovery and reconstruction efforts progressed, albeit slowly. A number of overdue political
decisions needed to be reached to accelerate the reconstruction process. The swearing-in of a new
Government was an important milestone in Haiti’s efforts to rebuild and move forward with socio-
economic development.

10.     The political climate in Haiti nevertheless remains contentious. Despite the peaceful
transition, President Martelly’s term has been marked by strong tensions between the Executive and
Parliament. There was a five-month delay in Parliament’s approval of the Prime Minister, Mr. Gary
Conille, who resigned in February 2012 after only five months in office. In May 2012, Mr. Laurent
Lamothe took office as Prime Minister with the promise to revive stalled post-earthquake
reconstruction efforts and organize legislative and municipal elections by end-2012. Prime Minister
Lamothe’s business-friendly stance has been received positively by donors and by the private sector
and initially gave new impetus to reconstruction. Nevertheless, the clear break with practices of
patronage and opaque management of public resources that many had hoped for has not yet fully
                                                 2
materialized. A standoff with Parliament over the composition of the Electoral Council which
delayed overdue legislative and municipal elections has only recently been resolved.

11.    Despite an environment prone to volatility, the change in the Minister of Economy and
Finance in April 2013 did not interrupt the Government’s reform program. The former
Minister of Economy and Finance had initiated a series of institutional and governance reforms,
many of which are supported by the proposed DPG. Her successor, the sitting Minister of Trade
and Industry, immediately committed to continuing these key reforms, as reflected in the
Government’s Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 1).

12.     The uncertain security situation persists. Violent demonstrations subsided after the
completion of the presidential election, and the overall security situation was relatively calm during
2012. But growing frustration over the increase in the price of basic foodstuffs, dissatisfaction with
the slow pace of reconstruction, and allegations of corruption are fueling discontent, posing a threat
to social stability. Following the severe impact of the storms Isaac and Sandy on the agricultural
sector and the country’s infrastructure during the 2012 hurricane season, a further deterioration in
living conditions could prompt a surge in discontent and possibly violence.

B. Recent Economic Developments and Poverty Trends
13.     After suffering a devastating earthquake in January 2010 that killed over 300,000 and
displaced over a million Haitians, the economy has recovered only modestly. Most
macroeconomic indicators were relatively stable over the last two years (see Table 1). The
economy contracted sharply in FY10 (real GDP declined 5.4 percent) due to the earthquake that
occurred in the second quarter of the fiscal year. Real GDP growth rebounded to 5.6 percent in
FY11, driven by construction, manufacturing and service sector growth financed by massive
external aid inflows equivalent to 10 percent of GDP. Delays in the FY12 budget approval led to
slower than anticipated capital spending, however, and acted as a drag on economic activities in
2012. The modest 5 percent growth observed in construction activities and 3 percent growth in
services were compounded by a severe drought in April and hurricane-related damages to
agricultural production in August 2012 (Hurricane Isaac), pulling down agricultural output by 2.2
percent. As a result, economic growth slowed to an estimated 2.8 percent in FY12 (compared to a
projected rate of 6 percent).

14.     Macroeconomic stability has been largely preserved over the last two fiscal years,
thanks to the policies pursued by the Government and Central Bank. Inflation accelerated to
10.4 percent at end FY11 mainly because of the surge in international food and commodity prices
and weak local agricultural production, but moderated to 6.5 percent in FY12. The exchange rate
regime, a managed float, is being effectively implemented by the Central Bank, which allowed only
some modest depreciation to contain inflationary pressures. The currency has nevertheless
remained stable in the past two years. Moreover, the Central Bank’s recent measures to curb
dollarization are expected to help strengthen demand for gourdes, provided that alternative
investment opportunities are available on domestic financial markets. The Government has made
progress in domestic financial market deepening, reflected by successful issuance of T-bills.

* Discrepancy in overall balance in some years due to unidentified spending and delays between the approval and execution of
public expenditures.


15.   External balances and the stock of reserves are healthy. Export growth was a very
modest 2 percent in FY12 after a boom in FY11 (36 percent growth in real terms, from a very low

                                                                4
base), while imports fell sharply by 12.4 percent in FY12 compared to the 7.3 percent growth
recorded in FY11 and 38 percent growth in FY10. Despite these fluctuations, the current account
deficit remained relatively stable at -4.6 percent of GDP in FY11 and -4.0 percent in FY12,
financed by increasing levels of FDI and PetroCaribe project funding. The expansion of
manufacturing facilities within integrated economic zones – assisted by a new regulatory
framework – is expected to boost exports and job creation in the sector. The authorities have
accumulated a healthy level of gross international reserves, which increased from US$2.0 billion in
FY11 to US$2.2 billion in FY12 (equivalent to over 6 months of imports).

16.     Fiscal deficits are relatively modest due to high levels of donor assistance. Grants
jumped to 16.5 percent of GDP after the earthquake, resulting in an FY10 fiscal surplus because the
Government was unable to absorb resources quickly enough. As capital expenditures accelerated to
21.7 percent of GDP, the FY11 fiscal deficit reached 4.1 percent of GDP (including grants), in spite
of increased domestic revenues (to 13 percent of GDP in FY11) and stable current expenditure.
Recent measures by the Customs Directorate (DGD) and the Tax Directorate (DGI) and intensified
tax collection efforts supported by technical assistance from the IMF contributed to higher domestic
revenues in FY11 and FY12. But the subsequent sharp slowdown in grant inflows – from 16.8
percent of GDP in FY11 to 10.6 percent of GDP in FY12 – led the overall FY12 deficit to widen to
5.9 percent of GDP, despite a decline in capital spending to 17.4 percent of GDP partly due to
delays in the FY12 budget approval.

17.     The composition of Government financing has shifted. Donor assistance for budget
support and project grants contracted significantly in FY12, but PetroCaribe, the oil import
financing arrangement with Venezuela, has become a dominant source of non-grant external
financing. The level of PetroCaribe funding has increased in recent years, from 2 percent of GDP in
FY09 to over 4 percent of GDP in FY11 and FY12 (see Annex 4, Box 4.2 for a description of the
PetroCaribe agreement). The Government has also been able to access internal financing from the
Central Bank and, more recently, through issuing T-bills. Haiti’s pre-earthquake debt levels were
significant, but a series of debt forgiveness arrangements – the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) relief and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) – sharply reduced external debt
obligations from 29 percent of GDP in FY08 to only 8.9 percent of GDP by FY11. Public debt
accumulation resumed, however, pushing the external debt-to-GDP ratio to 13.3 percent of GDP in
FY12, driven by PetroCaribe sources.

18.     The financial sector has shown marked improvement in recent years. The share of non-
performing loans (NPLs) has decreased considerably with the recent expansion in the total loan
portfolio and the write-off of loans undertaken in the course of the last two years, but banks remain
excessively liquid. NPLs were 2.4 percent in September 2012, compared with 3.7 percent in
September 2011, and 5.7 percent the previous year. Reconstruction has fueled credit growth; credit
to the private sector increased by 24 percent in FY11 and 30 percent in FY12. The Central Bank
reduced interest rates and introduced reserve requirement exemptions for resources channeled to the
housing sector. Furthermore, the Central Bank has implemented a guarantee scheme and a fixed-
rate liquidity facility for mortgage lending. These have supported banks’ profitability and capital
replenishment; the system’s Return Over Average Equity (ROAE) is currently estimated at 22
percent, 8 percentage points higher than in the neighboring Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
banking system. On the other hand, banks are not fully utilizing their resources for lending, despite
high levels of liquidity. Credit has been disproportionately allocated for trading rather than

                                                 5
productive activities that create value-added and contribute to growth. Credit growth slowed in the
first two quarters of FY13, as the BRH tightened its policy stance to curb excess credit growth by
raising by 5 percentage points the reserve requirements applicable to banks. The insurance sector
currently comprises nine insurers and is largely unregulated, which limits the level of information
available about the sector. According to Axco Insurance Information Services, the estimated gross
insurance premium is equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP, which is low compared to regional
standards.

19.     The IMF satisfactorily concluded the fifth review of its ECF program in March 2013.
Haiti’s program with the IMF, a three-year arrangement under the 2010 Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) totaling SDR40.95 million (about US$60 million) has remained on track despite the difficult
post-earthquake environment. The most recent disbursement of US$7 million in March 2013
brought total ECF disbursements to US$54 million. An Article IV mission was completed in
December 2012 and presented to the IMF Executive Board in March 2013.

20.     Haiti’s poverty situation remains severe, and is likely to have been made worse by the
earthquake. Haiti is also one of the most unequal countries, with a Gini coefficient of 0.59. Before
the earthquake, poverty levels were extremely high. The 2001 Household Survey indicates that 78
percent of the population lived below the US$2-a-day poverty line, and 58 percent fell below the
US$1-a-day poverty line.2 Haiti’s 2011 Human Development Index ranking was 158th out of 187
countries. Although no household data has been published since the earthquake, the devastating
impact of the earthquake on the population (especially in Port-au-Prince) is likely to have worsened
the poverty picture, in particular for the poor and vulnerable in the earthquake affected area. In
addition to the immediate negative impacts of the massive loss of life, the destruction of property
and infrastructure, and the interruption of services, the number of single-headed households
increased following the earthquake, and surveys of time-use indicate that the logistics of survival
(procuring food/water/sanitation) were estimated to absorb 80 percent of women’s time in the
aftermath of the disaster, leaving little time for income-generating activities. Haiti’s vulnerability
to periodic storms and hurricanes translates into damaged agricultural production and upward
pressure on food prices, which is particularly harmful given that two-fifths of Haitians are food
insecure.3 Two Bank-financed household surveys are expected to be completed by June 2013: a
survey on living standards (ECMAS), and a joint Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). These surveys will allow a better understanding of the
evolution of poverty levels and income distribution in Haiti, and the elaboration of the first
comprehensive Poverty Assessment for Haiti since 2001.

C. Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability
21.    Over the next three years, the economy is expected to grow at a slightly faster pace
than in FY12. Assuming a steady rate of government investment spending and moderate damage
from periodic weather-related events4, annual economic growth in our baseline scenario is projected
to be 3-4 percent in the coming three years, provided that the right policies can be implemented.

(CNSA), Port- au Prince, Haiti, 2012.
4
  The baseline scenario assumes annual weather-related damages equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP, based on average
costs of flooding and storm damages over the past 10 years (IMF Article IV Staff Report, March 2013).

                                                       6
Exceptionally high levels of public investment averaging 17-18 percent of GDP over the next three
years are expected to finance social and economic infrastructure rebuilding and provide stimulus to
the economy, but this would be moderated by weather-related damages. Repairing the substantial
post-earthquake structural damage – or newly arising hurricane-related damages – would continue
to buoy the construction sector, and prospects for the manufacturing sector – supported by the Haiti
Economic Lift Program (HELP) initiative, a favorable trade agreement with the US – are positive,
with steady growth anticipated from the current low base.

22.     Most key macroeconomic indicators are projected to reflect reconstruction challenges
but would remain sound for the next three years and beyond (see Table 1). Continued high
public expenditures are expected to pose a challenge for the fiscal balance, despite an anticipated
steady increase in tax revenue. Although Central Government transfers to electricity utility EDH
(Electricité d’Haïti) remain high, they are expected to decline through FY16 concurrent with
energy sector reforms. Moreover, Government efforts in PFM and cash management monitoring
and efficiency improvements will contribute to contain expenditures. Other donors, principally the
IMF, are supporting sustained improvements in tax revenue through a series of measures aimed at
reducing tax exemptions, creating a medium-sized enterprises unit in the Directorate of Tax, and
implementing an e-declaration system, inter alia. The projections shown in Table 1 anticipate a
continued deceleration of inflation from 6.5 percent at end FY12 to 5 percent at end FY13, as world
price projections for oil, energy and food decrease in the near term and domestic credit to the
private sector slows. It is expected that reconstruction efforts will continue to weigh on Haiti’s
external position. The current account deficit is projected to improve to -3.4 percent of GDP in
FY13 due to a recovery in exports, but widen thereafter to -4 percent of GDP, due primarily to
increased imports linked to sustained public investment which requires imported goods.

23.     This economic outlook is subject to a number of uncertainties. Haiti is highly vulnerable
to natural disasters including hurricanes and flash floods, and renewed occurrence of large-scale
natural disasters could slow economic growth and divert resources from the longer-term
development agenda towards more urgent recovery and reconstruction needs. The uncertain global
environment linked to the euro zone financial crisis and weak economic recovery in the US poses a
risk to growth prospects and macroeconomic balances. For example, a global recession could affect
Haiti through weakened demand for exports, reductions in external support for reconstruction,
and/or lower remittance inflows, resulting in a deterioration of the economic situation. The
uncertain political environment – characterized by high turnover and tensions between the
Executive Branch and Parliament – could potentially slow the pace of reform due to political
stalemate, and thus depress economic growth.

24.     Haiti’s challenge going forward is to maximize the current aid momentum and
prepare for reduced external assistance in the medium term. External support has played a key
role in financing the government’s reconstruction program and in obtaining the current
macroeconomic stability. Over the last two years, external financing (i.e., grants plus PetroCaribe
funding) amounted to 21 percent of GDP in FY11, and 15 percent of GDP in FY12. The bulk of
recent social and economic achievements is attributable to the stimulus provided by this
exceptionally high level of external assistance, which also helped attenuate the fiscal deficit.
However, grants are expected to decrease in FY14 and may fall to pre-earthquake levels in the
medium term. This risk could materialize even in the short term, in the event of a reduction in
official transfers to Haiti, potentially disrupting the stream of expenditures and negatively affecting

                                                  7
reconstruction, both from the social and growth angles. Without external assistance, Haiti’s fiscal
situation would be precarious. The Government’s program to decrease its dependence on donor
support includes measures to (i) improve public resource efficiency – including through PFM,
procurement and electricity sector reforms; (ii) target grant funding to infrastructure and human
capital investment that supports growth; (iii) foster private sector development through regulatory
reform and export promotion in integrated economic zones; and (iv) mobilize additional resources
through fiscal reforms and public-private partnerships, inter alia. Even with these efforts, Haiti will
nevertheless continue to rely on external financing for the foreseeable future.

25.      Although Haiti’s total debt burden was significantly reduced through debt forgiveness
(from 38 percent of GDP in FY08 to 12 percent of GDP in FY11), Haiti’s risk of debt distress
remains high. Haiti’s nominal external public debt as of end-FY11 was estimated at US$657
million. In present value (PV) terms, the external public debt was US$479 million, equivalent to 48
percent of exports, 50 percent of government revenue, and 7 percent of GDP at end-2011.5 Debt
reductions resulted from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) debt reliefs, and from subsequent debt relief to help Haiti overcome the
devastating earthquake of January 2010. As shown in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) in
Annex 4, prepared jointly by the Fund and Bank staffs in February 2012, rapid debt build-up is
expected in the short-to-medium term, and will lead to a breach of the sustainability threshold of
100 percent of exports in 2017. These results point to the need for enhanced monitoring of the
evolution of external debt and adopting policies that support exports. The Government has
implemented plans to enhance the capacity of its Debt Unit, and the Bank is providing technical
assistance and training on debt sustainability analysis, inter alia. The favorable oil import financing
arrangement with Venezuela, PetroCaribe, has enabled the Government to finance extensive capital
investment on subsidized terms. Going forward, Haiti will continue to access PetroCaribe resources
under favorable terms in order to finance badly needed investments; however, achieving a
significant return on such investments will be important for avoiding the accumulation of excessive
external debt without significant improvement in Haiti’s repayment capacity.

26.     Notwithstanding the significant challenges inherent to the post-earthquake situation
and a future transition to fiscal self-sufficiency, the macroeconomic policy framework is
adequate to support the proposed Grant, reduce volatility, and sustain growth without
accumulating excessive debt. The proposed DPG support equivalent to US$20 million, together
with budget support provided by other donors totaling a further US$73 million in FY13, will help
finance essential expenditures and meet external financing needs. The government’s FY13-FY15
financing needs are projected to be covered through grants, external financing and, to a lesser
extent, issuance of government securities in the form of T-bills.

             III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND REFORM AGENDA

27.   While a new medium-term National Strategy is being developed to respond to the post-
earthquake reality, the March 2010 strategy for reconstruction and development (PARDH)
remains relevant, enhanced by the priorities subsequently articulated by President Martelly.
The PARDH aims to improve infrastructure, develop growth industries, and address governance as

5
 Haiti’s external creditors are Venezuela (71 percent of total nominal debt), Taiwan Province of China (14 percent), the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) (10 percent), the IMF (4 percent), and the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (2 percent).

                                                           8
one of its main themes. The long-term vision for Haiti’s development is the rebuilding of the
nation, transforming the disaster of January 2010 into an opportunity for Haiti to become an
emerging market by 2030. The following four pillars anchor this vision.
       (a) Territorial rebuilding foresees completing the implementation of the national transport
system, the electrification of the country, the expansion of digital communications, increase in
water supply and sanitation (including solid waste management, as well as activities in terms of
planning and local development), the protection of the environment and watershed, and urban
renewal. Programs under this pillar will install and upgrade the infrastructure required for economic
growth, job creation and access to social services.
        (b) Economic rebuilding aims at supporting private investment, modernizing and
revitalizing the agriculture sector, livestock and fisheries, developing the competitive sectors of the
Haitian economy, particularly manufacturing and tourism, as well as developing the professional
construction sector.
        (c) Social rebuilding involves creating networks of modern health and education centers
across the country, including higher education and vocational and technical training; protecting
cultural assets and supporting cultural creativity; ensuring better access to housing; and establishing
a health system that ensures minimum coverage throughout the country and social protection for the
most vulnerable.
        (d) Institutional rebuilding focuses on rebuilding the capacities of affected government
departments by prioritizing the most essential functions; redefining the legal and regulatory
framework in line with national requirements; implementing an institutional structure that will
oversee the reconstruction process; and establishing a culture of transparency and accountability
that deters corruption.

28.    The PARDH is complemented by the five strategic priorities identified by President
Martelly, namely: Environment, Employment, the Rule of Law, Education, and Energy. The new
government is currently working to integrate both into a broader national development strategy
aimed at transforming the country into an emerging economy by 2030. The attached letter of
development policy sets out the objectives and priorities of the Government’s economic program.

              IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A. Link to ISN
29.     The World Bank Group’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Haiti for FY13-14 was
discussed by the Executive Directors on September 27, 2012. The overarching objective of the
Interim Strategy is to support the Government of Haiti in implementing sustainable post-earthquake
reconstruction through: (i) reducing Haiti’s vulnerability to disasters and crises and increase its
resilience to shocks; (ii) sustainable reconstruction in key infrastructure; (iii) building human and
social capital; and (iv) promoting inclusive growth. Strengthening governance in favor of
reconstruction is a crosscutting theme defined in the ISN that will permeate all operations and drive
the content of budget support operations. The proposed DPG provides support to the governance
theme as well as specific support to objectives (ii) and (iv) above. The DPG supports key outcomes
of the ISN, specifically (a) improvements to the commercial viability of the electricity sector,
(b) improved transparency, accountability and efficiency of public resource use, leading to
increased spending effectiveness across ministries, and (c) the continuation of the Government’s

                                                  9
economic reform program and the transfer of resources to the Haitian budget in the event of a
financing gap. The ISN identifies this DPG as one of its important operations to support the
Government’s reform agenda on economic governance.

B. Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors
30.    Numerous donors are active in Haiti. The EU, the IMF, Spain, France, Canada, the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) are providing support in a number of areas, including public finance
management, electricity sector reforms, and governance, inter alia. A joint-mission of donors
involved in budget support took place in February 2012 to coordinate the policy actions
underpinning the Government’s reform program and budget support operations. This mission
followed on a series of joint supervision missions and consultations among the members of the
Joint Budget Support Group (Groupe Conjoint d’Appui Budgétaire, GCAB), including in particular
the World Bank, IADB, EU, France, Spain, CIDA, USAID, and in collaboration with the IMF. The
donors signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in April 2009 with the objective of
harmonizing budget support operations and establishing a budget support group to provide a forum
to exchange information among stakeholders and support policy dialogue with the Government.
The Government drafted a joint policy matrix which is currently being updated, and the GCAB
coordinates closely in the supervision of the implementation of the reforms contained in the matrix.
The donor coordination process, led by the Government, is flexible, allowing for bilateral
discussion and adjustments to the joint policy matrix as needed. The policy measures in the
proposed Grant represent a subset of policies delineated in the joint donor matrix, and other donors’
budget support also depends on the set of policies summarized in this matrix. The combined level
of budget support from the IADB, EU, Spain, France, Norway and the World Bank amounted
to US$87 million in FY11, US$27 million in FY12 (lower due to delays in EU and Bank
support) and a projected US$93 million in FY13 including the proposed Grant and a planned
Haiti Reconstruction Fund operation for which the Bank has agreed to act as the partner entity.

31.    The IMF’s ECF program addresses key issues including: (i) enhancing public resource
mobilization and spending efficiency; (ii) improving liquidity management and increasing the
financial sector’s contribution to growth; and (iii) improving the business and investment
environment. The periodic assessment of Haiti’s macroeconomic performance by the IMF –
including the recent Article IV consultations – serves as a key input for dialogue on policies related
to macroeconomic stability and for ensuring timely disbursement of budget support.

32.     CIDA is actively supporting the government’s public finance management programs
through a series of training activities to strengthen budget preparation, especially the capacity of
staff in the Programming and Analysis units (UEPs) in line ministries. CIDA also provides
technical assistance to support tax and customs administrations, and its PARGEP project provides
training in budget audit and control for staff of the Financial Audit and External Audit Offices of
Haiti. USAID provides support to the Directorate of Taxes in the development of Strategic and
Tactical Plans for modernizing and reviewing the main tax laws, implementing sound tax audits,
collections, and taxpayer services and education, as well as developing a plan for data processing.
Finally, USAID, IADB and CIDA are all active in the energy sector.




                                                 10
C. Relationship to Other Bank Operations
33.     To support recovery and reconstruction efforts in an environment of weak
institutional capacity, the World Bank Group is providing a broad range of sectoral and
budget support. The proposed Grant is designed to reinforce and complement the objectives of
recent, ongoing and planned World Bank operations in Haiti in line with the government’s
development agenda and with a particular focus on strengthening institutions.

34.      The proposed Grant builds on the series of Economic Governance Reform Operations
(EGRO) and the recently closed Emergency Development Policy Operation (DPO). In this
context, the proposed single-tranche operation is part of a programmatic approach which
began by establishing the foundations of sound PFM and procurement practices and electricity
sector governance, subsequently strengthened checks and balances in the emergency phase, and is
now strengthening institutions and policy implementation under the current operation (Figure 1
illustrates the evolution of policies supported by DPOs). As shown in Figure 1, the EGRO series
focused on setting policy and laying the foundations for institution building and enhanced
transparency by strengthening the regulatory framework and institutional capacity, and supporting
the government's implementation of critical economic and public sector governance reforms in
public finance management, procurement, anti-corruption, and transparency of public transfers in
the electricity sector. While the Government made encouraging progress under EGRO I (January
2005) and EGRO II (January 2007), the EGRO III – approved in December 2009 as a
programmatic series of two operations aimed at consolidating the gains achieved under the
preceding two operations – was discontinued after the earthquake in January 2010. The operation
was closed in October 2010, one year before its closing date, to redirect resources so as to better
support Haiti in addressing the new policy and development challenges in the aftermath of the
disaster.

35.     Under the Emergency DPO (August 2010), the overall focus of the Government shifted
to strengthening checks and balances mechanisms while providing emergency support. The
objective was to mitigate any potential negative impact of the earthquake on governance due to the
weakening of oversight institutions under exceptional circumstances. In complement to the
Emergency DPO, the Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project (US$65
million) approved after the earthquake focused on restoring key economic and financial
functions of the government. A further US$35 million in Additional Financing was approved in
September 2012. The project includes rehabilitation of and equipment for offices as well as
technical assistance to reinstate the basic functions of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
in accounting, reporting, budget monitoring, and control, re-establish the Court of Accounts,
strengthen external audit capacity, and restart operations at the procurement regulatory body and in
the procurement units in line ministries. These efforts are being complemented by a Governance
Partnership Facility (GPF), Enhancing Political Leadership to Improve Governance and
Public Sector Performance in Haiti (US$500,000), which (i) supports capacity building of the
Inspection Générale des Finances (IGF) and (ii) identifies and helps to address obstacles to a better
performing Court of Accounts.

36.     The measures foreseen under this DPG complement and strengthen efforts undertaken under
two Energy Sector operations financed by IDA aimed at making energy more accessible and more
affordable for the Haitian population. The ongoing Electricity Loss Reduction Project
(PREPSEL, US$11 million) aims at improving the financial viability of EDH. It was approved in
2006 and restructured and expanded in 2008-9 to support the installation of new billing and grid
maintenance systems (CMS and TSMS) and remote meters for large clients, provide capacity-
building support to strengthen EDH’s anti-fraud unit and external expertise to assist EDH
Management, and support enhanced transparency of transfers from the state to the electricity sector
through setting up the monitoring mechanism and regular disclosure of key indicators.6 The project
is expected to close in August 2013. A new IDA Grant, the Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure
and Energy Access Project (US$90 million), was approved in September 2012, and expands
access to reliable electricity services through power sector infrastructure rehabilitation and
expansion and strengthens energy policy and planning capacity. The electricity sector reforms
supported by the proposed Grant will enhance the impact of the projects’ investment activities by
increasing EDH’s effectiveness and financial position, freeing resources to upgrade and expand
electricity service quality and access.

37.      Two complementary projects aimed at job creation and growth (for a total of US$65
million – the Business Development and Investment Project and the Heritage and Tourism
Development Project) are scheduled for Board presentation in FY13 and early FY14. The first
aims to accelerate private sector-led growth and increase employment opportunities in Haiti by
strengthening the legal framework for industrial parks and integrated economic zones, and through
institutional strengthening activities to improve the environment for investment. The second project
will support decentralized growth around Cap Haïtien and the National Historic Park. These
projects are underpinned by IFC advisory services related to the investment climate. Two main
IFC initiatives address Investment Generation and the Doing Business Reform Agenda. IFC also
has an active program providing investment services; IFC has committed a total of US$76

  The monitoring mechanism table tracks seven groups of technical and financial indicators, including budgetary
transfers to EDH, electricity produced and amount and price of fuel used on a monthly basis.

Investments after the earthquake include: a US$6 million loan (of which US$3 million syndicated)
to enable the expansion of important garment manufacturer Group M; an equity support to Canada-
based Eurasian Minerals’ gold and copper exploration in Haiti, which will support 800 jobs; an
additional US$1 million loan to help complete the 30MW power generation plant E-Power; and the
recurring activation of Capital Bank’s trade finance credit line.

D. Lessons Learned
38.     Experience points to the need to adopt a simple approach in fragile countries, and
supports the use of a single-tranche operation. Weak institutional capacity, particularly when
coupled with political and/or social instability, can hinder lasting reforms. The design of a budget
support operation should avoid the risk of delaying disbursement or stalling implementation due to
political turnover or exogenous factors. Moreover, fragility is amplified in countries prone to
natural disasters. For instance, the implementation of both the EGRO II (a two-tranche budget
support operation) and the EGRO III (a programmatic operation) were negatively affected by back-
to-back hurricanes and the 2010 earthquake, which increased financing needs while making the
programmatic results-framework of the DPO inoperative. A one-tranche operation allows the Bank
to support the Government in areas that need urgent attention while building on long-term structural
reforms in a programmatic way.

39.     Countries that have experienced major natural disasters need strong institutional
support to back up critical reforms aimed at quickly restoring state functions. Institutional
rebuilding and strengthening of legal and regulatory frameworks were the main objectives of the
predecessor operation, the Emergency DPO. Making headway in these areas would not have been
possible without significant technical assistance and reconstruction projects aimed at supporting
relevant institutions (e.g., activities under the Infrastructure and Institutions Recovery Emergency
Project for the Court of Accounts, the procurement regulatory body, and the Ministry of Finance).
Therefore, the proposed Grant aligns its objectives with existing technical assistance programs and
projects to minimize the risk of slow implementation. Other donor-financed operations further
complement the technical assistance provided by the Bank.

40.     The fragile state environment also calls for reforms that build the foundations for an
effective system of economic governance. In this context, reforms with an institutional focus that
are difficult to reverse can have a greater impact in the medium term by assisting fragile countries
to move to a sustainable development path.

41.      While strengthening the legal framework for public sector governance in DPGs
remains critical for ensuring proper management of aid inflows in fragile states, growth-
enhancing reforms also need to be strongly promoted. Ensuring that public sector governance
institutions function appropriately is crucial for improving service delivery and enhancing the
efficiency of public spending. At the same time, there is a need to emphasize growth policies to
ensure a sustained recovery process and lasting results. In Haiti, while continuing to focus budget
support programs on economic governance, more needs to be done to underpin sustainable growth,
which is critical for the success of the reconstruction process and to ensure that an environment
conducive to the private sector’s development is in place. Drawing from that lesson, the proposed
Grant combines public sector governance reforms with measures to enhance the business climate

                                                14
through more efficient and dependable electricity provision, an important condition for attracting
private investment.

42.     Complementing investment project activities with sectoral policy reforms can enhance
the impact of both. The proposed Grant has effectively leveraged strong governance reforms by
supporting measures that complement the Bank’s sectoral investment program and technical
assistance. The electricity sector provides a prime example. Significant delays in the purchase and
installation of meters for independent power producers (IPPs) since the beginning of the Electricity
Loss Reduction Project severely inhibited progress, but the policy dialogue and reform measures
addressed in the proposed Grant helped resolve implementation bottlenecks. This achievement
underpins a renewed dynamic for reform in the electricity sector, where the authorities have (a)
initiated the review and harmonization process of the current power purchase agreements with IPPs,
and (b) incentivized EDH to install remote metering on all other power plants in order to have full
transparency, monitoring and operational control of power generation in Haiti.

43.     Mutual coordination and coherence of policy dialogue among donors are essential for
improved aid effectiveness. Coordination is important in order to reach achievable but solid
milestones and indicators, develop a commonly agreed reform framework, and address issues of
capacity building. For instance, progress achieved in public financial management has been the
result of extensive and effective coordination among partners. The harmonization of budget support
operations and technical assistance through the Joint Budget Support Group in Haiti has provided a
forum for a coordinated effort to address weak governance and improve capacity.

E. Analytical Underpinnings
44.     The proposed Grant draws on a wide range of analytical work carried out in recent
years by the Government, the Bank and other development partners. Instrumental to
identifying reforms in the domain of PFM was the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) evaluation, commissioned by the Government and supported by the European Commission
(completed in January 2012). Among the persistent weaknesses, the evaluation highlights, inter
alia, the efforts needed to further improve overall budget management and the transparency and
completeness of budgetary processes. The PEFA report, complemented by IMF PFM TA reports,
also underlines the need for a more efficient and integrated cash management system with a view to
avoiding unnecessary costs through better control and efficiency. The reforms supported by the
proposed Grant are based on the PEFA diagnostic.

45.     The White Paper on Energy, produced by the Government with donor support in
2010, analyzes the energy sector in detail, and explains the reasons why Haitians have among
the lowest access to electricity in the world. The study identifies inefficiencies and constraints at
all levels in the energy sector, and particularly in the production and distribution of electricity. The
report points to a defective commercial operation at the national electricity utility EDH, since the
company does not bill for a sufficiently high portion of electricity provided to the network, and it
only collects a fraction of what it bills. EDH’s resulting poor performance leads to massive
transfers from the public treasury to the electricity sector. One of the report’s conclusions is the
need to improve governance and management, whose weakness is the cause of poor operational and
financial performance.

                              V.     THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A. Overall Description
46.      The proposed Development Policy Grant in an amount equivalent to US$20 million
supports the Government’s reconstruction programs. In particular, the operation supports three
axes of the Government’s strategy for reconstruction and development (PARDH), namely (a)
territorial rebuilding with a focus on infrastructure, in particular the electricity sector; (b) economic
rebuilding with a focus on more efficient public procurement and attracting private investment; and
(c) institutional rebuilding with a focus on government’s essential functions in public financial
management and procurement.

47.   The proposed Grant supports critical prior actions that address the following three
complementary policy areas:

          strengthening public investment tracking and enhancing cash management systems;
          reinforcing the institutional framework and capacity for effective public procurement;
          strengthening governance and financial performance in the electricity sector.

48.    The proposed Grant aligns its policy areas with the country’s short- and medium-term
challenges by placing emphasis on the conditions needed for enhancing the efficiency of public
spending in view of maximizing the impact of the high level of grants in the transition period,
following which grants are likely to return to pre-earthquake levels.

49.    The prior actions that the Government has already taken to implement its development and
reconstruction program are summarized in Box 1.




                                                   16
                                                Box 1. Prior Actions

Prior action 1. The Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation has established and staffed a Directorate of Public
Investment within the said ministry.

Prior action 2. The Programming and Analysis Units (UEPs) in line ministries have been staffed, and a UEP action
plan to restructure and strengthen the said UEPs was adopted in January 2013 by the Prime Minister’s Office
(Primature).

Prior action 3. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has adopted the May 2012 strategy to establish the Single
Treasury Account, and closed 301 idle and dormant public accounts at the Central Bank and commercial banks.

Prior action 4. Pursuant to the Procurement Law dated June 10, 2009, the Government has issued and published on
December 21, 2012 through its executive branch, the following two implementing regulations (“arrêtés d’application?)
covering respectively: (i) the code of ethics for officials involved in procurement activities; and (ii) the standard
documents for evaluating bids.

Prior action 5. All line ministries have established and staffed ministerial procurement units (commissions
ministérielles de passation des marchés), and the Commission Nationale des Marchés Publics (CNMP) has provided
training to the staffs of such units.

Prior action 6. In order to improve public procurement practices, the Government has, in accordance with the Arrêté
dated February 16, 2005 and the Emergency Law dated April 19, 2010, rescinded 5 contracts awarded under the said
Emergency Law.

Prior action 7. EDH has initiated the use of meter readings from functional remote meters newly installed at IPP entry
points to verify IPP production levels and inform billing.

Prior action 8. EDH has performed on-site meter testing and verified meter readings for at least 200 priority customers,
re-issued bills, and implemented arrears recovery plans when applicable.

Prior action 9. The Central Government, through the Ministry of Economy and Finance, has settled all of its FY12
payment delays to EDH.


B. Development Objective
50.      The proposed Grant’s development objective is to support the Government of Haiti’s
program of sustainable reconstruction and growth. Towards this end, the Grant supports
institution building and the strengthening of economic governance in sectors critical to
reconstruction and growth in the short and medium term.

C. Operation Design
51.      The program design demonstrates the pragmatism required to deepen governance
reforms in areas addressed by predecessor operations in the context of a fragile state.
Consistent with this strategy, attention is geared toward institution-building and sound governance
conditions to ensure the efficient use and enhanced accountability of reconstruction funds. Areas of
continuity include strengthening budget management, public procurement, and transparency and
efficiency in the electricity sector (recall Figure 1). The reform in public expenditure management
focuses on areas deemed critical for improving capital budget execution rates, monitoring and
transparency. This will be complemented by efficiency gains from improved cash management
systems. With respect to procurement, the proposed Grant shifts the focus from strengthening the
legal and regulatory framework to actual implementation of the Procurement Law through
institutional reforms. And in the area of electricity, the focus shifts to creating the conditions critical
                                                          17
for efficient private investment that would complement Government efforts to expand electricity
supply and coverage, while preserving the integrity of public transfer management.

52.     The Grant supposes the resumption of efforts aimed at implementing medium-term-
oriented public sector governance reforms following the earthquake and the presidential
election. The earthquake represented a major setback to the progress made in governance under the
previous budget support operations. Following the disaster and supported by the Emergency DPO,
the focus of the authorities shifted to rebuilding government institutions and strengthening the
control systems of public resources in the context of reconstruction. Despite a challenging period
due to political uncertainty since end-2010, all public institutions have been restored to operational
status, are equipped and staffed, and control systems have been strengthened significantly. The
reforms under the proposed Grant renew efforts to deepen policy reform implementation and
address weaknesses in public sector governance and efficient and transparent public resource use. A
broad agenda of reform remains to be defined beyond these measures, including in particular in the
areas of efficiency and quality of public spending, as well as results-based budgeting.

53.     The proposed Grant is a single-tranche operation. Whereas the supported actions build
on previous reforms, together comprising a programmatic reform agenda, the single tranche format
allows the flexibility required to capitalize on reform opportunities when they arise. Several
considerations support a stand-alone approach, including the limited political visibility at the outset
of project preparation, the Bank program’s two-year interim strategy time horizon, the
Government’s weak implementation capacity, and the lack of an articulated medium-term
Government strategy. The team also wishes to retain flexibility in light of the generally risky
implementation environment as well as the need to test the Government's commitment to solid
governance principles in the area of procurement under the Emergency Law. Furthermore, this
single-tranche operation is grounded in the donors’ harmonized budget support and technical
assistance efforts which are comprehensive and programmatic in nature. It will be crucial for the
Bank to continue to support the Government’s reform and institution building efforts, including
through technical assistance, analysis and policy advice.

D. Policy Areas
54.     The Grant supports key actions to strengthen economic governance in the following
policy areas: public financial management, public procurement, and electricity sector
performance. The policy matrix presented in Annex 2 summarizes the policy objectives, key
issues, measures taken prior to the Board presentation of this operation, baseline indicators, and the
expected outcomes to be achieved by June 2014. Each section below provides background
information on the challenges in each sector, describes the related objectives of the Government’s
reform program, and identifies the Government’s planned actions to achieve these objectives.

               i. Public Financial Management
               Strengthen public financial management through improved public
               investment tracking and cash management systems

55.     While acknowledging the progress achieved in managing public finances, several challenges
relating to transparency and accountability remain, including, but not limited to: (i) improving the


                                                  18
investment expenditure tracking system to enhance budget execution monitoring, and (ii) managing
the flow of resources to increase accountability and ensure timely availability of funds.

Background and Sector Issues
56.     The Government has discussed in an open forum the latest PEFA report analyzing the status
of public finance reforms, which serves as a basis for the short- and medium-term public finance
agenda. While recognizing the significant progress made in public expenditure management over
the recent past, the PEFA also acknowledges persistent weaknesses in some key areas.

57.     Haiti has made progress in budget preparation and transparency. The Ministry of
Finance has adopted a manual that sets clear and transparent guidelines for budget preparation. It
has also improved the consultation process with line ministries and civil society during the
preparatory phase of the budget. For instance, in April 2012, the Government organized a meeting
to discuss with civil society its evaluation and assessment of the 2011-12 budget, subsequent to a
first meeting in February 2012 during which the budget was presented by the Minister of Finance to
the public. The significant delay in submitting the budget to Parliament was due primarily to
external factors, namely damage to public institutions caused by the 2010 earthquake and the
protracted political situation in 2011 and part of 2012.7 One important example of increased
transparency is the publication of the budget. The 2012-13 budget was published in the Moniteur
on October 1, 2012, and is posted on the MEF website.

58.     Progress in budget execution and control has been modest but demonstrates
improvement. On budget execution, the Government has significantly reduced the use of special
accounts for current expenditures (from 60 percent in FY04 to less than 3 percent in FY10), and the
adoption of the manual for budget preparation and execution should lead to further improvement,
including a more systematic enforcement of internal procedures for expenditure processing. There
has been little progress for capital expenditure, however. On budget control, despite persistent
shortcomings, there is evidence of progress. The Treasury submits government accounts to the
Court of Accounts within the legal timeframe, and this was the case for the 2010-11 accounts. The
Court of Accounts has substantially reduced the backlog of audits of government accounts. It has
finalized the 2008-09 report and has sent to the Treasury the 2009-10 report. The internal auditing
body has successfully implemented key activities of its Action Plan approved in 2010. Among the
main results are: (i) an inventory of government and NGOs’ projects; (ii) audits of subsidies in the
education sector and the transfers by the MEF; (iii) analysis of audit reports issued by the Court of
Accounts; and (iv) audits of public accountants’ activities in the MEF.

59.     Persistent weaknesses in some key areas of public expenditure management
nevertheless remain, including: the lack of functional classification in the budget nomenclature,
which is needed to establish a link between policy and investment; the absence of a forward-
looking approach due to lack of multi-annual sector strategies and the institutional set-up between
sectors and the Ministry of Planning to translate sector strategies into a costed budget; the absence
of a single treasury account; and a partial expenditure tracking system, particularly with regard to
the Public Investment Program and PetroCaribe funds. The Government is currently developing an

 As per the Organic Law, in the absence of a new approved budget, monthly allocations to beneficiary institutions are
equivalent to one-twelfth the prior year’s annual budget allocation.

                                                         19
action plan to guide the reform effort in public finance management based on the findings of the
PEFA.

60.    The proposed Grant focuses on two critical items for improved transparency and
accountability of public resources management: public expenditure tracking and monitoring,
and the establishment of a Single Treasury Account. A system to track effectively where public
funds are spent and what outcomes result will make government functioning more transparent and
accountable; this in turn can be used to inform spending priorities and planning for the future.
Better expenditure tracking and monitoring is facilitated by streamlining the accounts through
which public funds are processed into a Single Treasury Account, reducing opportunities for funds
to be diverted and at the same time enabling more efficient cash management. These
complementary efforts are critical for the credibility of the Government’s efficient use of
reconstruction funds.

61.     With respect to tracking public expenditures, the existing system is fragmented and
does not provide comprehensive information. It captures only current expenditures and
allocations to line ministries for domestically-financed investment at the commitment stage.
For capital spending, once funds are transferred by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to the
Ministry of Planning and then onward to projects and/or line ministries, this transaction is
accounted as budget execution and there is no proper tracking of the status of expenditure
processing or project implementation. With respect to PetroCaribe funds, whereas they are under
the control of the central government and all transactions are captured in the fiscal accounts,
PetroCaribe projects are not systematically integrated into the Government’s Public Investment
Plan, and their accounting is not fully transparent, especially as their allocation between current and
capital spending is muddled. In addition, the current system omits a significant portion of funding
streams for traditional Government functions that are financed directly by donors. This lack of a
reliable monitoring and reporting information system limits the scope for monitoring consolidated
investment outcomes, improving budget execution rates, and programming future investment. This
is why the proposed Grant is supporting measures to improve the integrity of the budget and the
credibility of the public expenditure management system; the availability of information about
public spending both at the central and line ministry levels would shed light on how resources for
reconstruction – and public resources in general – are used, and clarify what outputs were delivered
by the budget. These steps are also essential building blocks toward multi-year investment planning
to support sector strategies. Unless these measures are fulfilled, the budget process will remain
weak, thereby limiting the development impact of public investment.

62.     The Government has taken actions to improve the expenditure tracking system and
monitoring of public spending outcomes. The Ministry of Planning has developed and started
rolling out in 2009 an information system (SYSGEP) linking line ministries with the Ministry of
Planning, which allows for consolidating data on investment budget execution and monitoring the
related physical execution and outcomes. In order to operationalize the system, the Government had
created Programming and Analysis Units (Unités d’Etudes et de Programmation – UEPs) in line
ministries, which were tasked with inputting into the system data on investment at various stages of
execution for further centralization and treatment at the level of the Ministry of Planning. Staff of
both the Ministry of Planning and some line ministries had been trained accordingly. However, the
earthquake and resulting destruction of most line ministries significantly sidelined this process.


                                                  20
63.    Recently, the Government issued instructions to all line ministries to resume
operationalizing the UEPs, and further trainings have taken place to train staff of both UEPs
and at the Directorate of Public Investment in the Ministry of Planning. The UEPs are tasked
with monitoring the execution of public investment projects and performing control and reporting
functions. It is expected that effectively operationalizing the UEPs would help establish the
mechanism for a systematic transmission of public investment execution data to the Ministry of
Planning and further consolidation into the budget execution report. But a key success factor will be
coordination by, and impetus from, the Ministry of Planning’s new Directorate of Public
Investment to ensure leadership and follow-up with the UEPs, without which the system will
remain ineffective. The unit in charge of coordinating with UEPs in the past was weak and did not
have the necessary authority and capacity to ensure effective leadership. The new Directorate of
Public Investment, in contrast, is empowered to interface directly with line ministries’ UEPs and
ensure exchange of information.

64.     In a complementary effort to improve control over public resources, and more broadly
to improve the efficiency of their use, the Government also has started implementing the
measures needed to establish a Single Treasury Account. The Ministry of Economy and Finance
recently completed an inventory of public accounts held by line ministries at the Central Bank and
commercial banks, identifying a total of 569 accounts. The inability of the Treasury to capture
accurate financial information from this large number of dispersed accounts – many no longer
active – impedes timely and accurate accounting and reporting of Government operations. This, in
turn, leads to a weak consolidation of financial information and constrains the monitoring of
physical outcomes of the budget. It also leads to ineffective cash flow forecasting and management,
or an absence thereof. The resulting suboptimal allocation of cash gives rise to payment arrears and
sometimes costly and entirely avoidable borrowing as well. Such weaknesses could also undermine
budget execution (e.g., if funds get misdirected to hidden accounts), and have been identified
among the factors accounting for discrepancies between programmed and executed budgets.

65.    Haiti has recently developed a capacity to issue Treasury bonds, which should help foster
financial sector development. Adopting measures to improve cash management will not only
increase payment efficiency and boost confidence in the Government; it will also enhance
transparency and expand information sharing. Therefore, reducing the number of bank accounts
to three per ministry – and ultimately to a Single Treasury Account – will contribute to more
transparent and efficient public resource use for reconstruction and other priority spending
by avoiding unnecessary borrowing costs and enhancing the Treasury’s control over public
resources. The Government is making significant headway, has closed 301 idle or dormant
accounts, and transferred any balances to a set of linked Treasury accounts in the Central Bank
through which the Government transacts all payments and centralizes cash balances. In September
2012, the MEF approved an action plan for implementing the Single Treasury Account, and this
plan was presented to the Council of Ministers. The key steps needed to reach this goal have been
communicated to line Ministers with specific deadlines. The rationalization of existing public
accounts is the precursor to establishing a Single Treasury Account, which is targeted by October
2014. The process of better cash flow management is underway and is supported by the Treasury
Committee created in January 2012 and chaired by the Minister of Finance, and which convenes on
a monthly basis.

Specific Actions Supported by the Grant
Prior action 1. The Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation has established and staffed a
Directorate of Public Investment within the said ministry. This entity has been integrated into the
Chart of the Ministry of Planning and is operational. The Directorate of Public Investment is
expected to coordinate the collection and treatment of information on budget execution from all
UEPs in line ministries for further consolidation and integration into the budget execution report.
The Directorate will also interface with the Ministry of Finance on budget planning, ensuring
consistency between the current and capital budget allocations. The Government has drafted a
report on the recent activities of the Directorate of Public Investment. [Action completed]

Prior action 2. The Programming and Analysis Units (UEPs) in line ministries have been staffed,
and a UEP action plan to restructure and strengthen the said UEPs was adopted in January 2013 by
the Prime Minister’s Office (Primature). Each line ministry has created and staffed UEPs. In light
of heretofore delays in the effective operation of the UEPs, the Government recently adopted an
action plan to restructure the UEPs and re-invigorate capacity building of the units, which includes
training for clearly enumerated procedures. [Action completed]

Prior action 3. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has adopted the May 2012 strategy to
establish the Single Treasury Account, and closed 301 idle and dormant public accounts at the
Central Bank and commercial banks.8 This prior action will lead to the rationalization of public
account management into a Single Treasury Account expected to be established by October 2014.
The significantly reduced number of public bank accounts has already made monitoring easier. The
next step in the strategy will be for each line ministry to close all but three bank accounts (one for
recurrent expenditures, one for capital expenditures, and one for revenues). These three accounts
are to be leveled on a daily basis by Treasury, supported by the recently created Treasury
Committee. [Action completed]

Expected Outcomes
66.     Short-term. By the closing date of this Grant in June 2014, it is expected that the
Directorate of Public Investment will publish quarterly budget execution reports using SYSGEP
containing information on public investment financed through the government budget – including
the proceeds of PetroCaribe – beyond the commitment stage, with information covering line
ministries and by project. This more detailed expenditure reporting system will not only increase
transparency, it will also enhance accountability and efficiency by providing a metric of
government policy impact as well as a clearer picture of the pace of reconstruction activities which
can ultimately inform future planning. This represents an important first step towards a
comprehensive reporting on all budget execution – both foreign and domestically financed – which
will require donors to furnish project execution and disbursement data to the MEF, something they
do not presently do. With respect to cash management, the fact that each ministry will only have
three accounts by the end of the operation represents important progress. The reduced number of
public bank accounts – ultimately to a Single Treasury Account – will enhance the Directorate of
the Treasury’s capacity to actively and efficiently manage cash flows, and limit opportunities for

 The "Stratégie pour la mise en place du Compte Unique du Trésor" was approved by the MEF on September 24, 2012.
The Minister of Finance presented the strategy at the Council of Ministers.

                                                      22
diversion of resources into unmanaged accounts. The result will be increased efficiency and
accountability in the use of public resources.

67.     Medium-term. Regularly published budget execution reports including externally financed
investment in the SYSGEP would enhance transparency in public resource use and assist the shift
to a multi-year budget framework. But this will depend on donors to furnish the necessary
information, a major challenge in most countries, and beyond the control of the Government. In
order to increase and sustain the impact of the reconstruction program, the Government plans to
start using a multi-year expenditure framework, which will be key for improving the predictability
and the alignment of the budget with priority policies, as well as ensuring the coherence of the
current and capital budgets. Some key ministries already have well-developed sector strategies and
medium-term expenditure plans; this exercise will be extended to all line ministries. Regarding cash
management, the Treasury Committee will work based on up-to-date and complete information
aided by a forward-looking Treasury plan. The establishment of a forward-looking cash-flow
forecast (plan de trésorerie) will contribute to a more efficient and less costly cash management
system, reduce cash constraints imposed on businesses dealing with the Government, and also
minimize the use of T-bills for short-term financing. The Single Treasury Account is expected to be
established by October 2014 for internal funds.

               ii. Public Procurement
               Establish a credible institutional framework for procurement and
               upgrade procurement management capacity

69.      Through the recent operationalization of the 2009 Procurement Law, the Government is
striving to address past weaknesses in public procurement and build the necessary processes,
institutional infrastructure and capacity to improve procurement practices and standards within an
effective legal framework. These efforts complement the expenditure tracking and cash
management measures to improve the efficiency and transparency of public resource use.

Background and Sector Issues
70.     The progress achieved in procurement before 2010 stalled after the earthquake.
Following the creation of a procurement regulatory body (Commission Nationale des Marchés
Publics – CNMP) and procurement units in key line ministries after the reengagement in 2005, the
Bank provided support to the Government to draft a new Procurement Law and the related first
implementing decrees, adopted in the second half of 2009. However, the reform process was
interrupted following the earthquake and the destruction of government institutions, including the
CNMP and line ministries. In order to accelerate reconstruction activities in the immediate
aftermath of the earthquake, the Government adopted an Emergency Law that included specific
dispositions allowing for limited competitive bidding for public contracts. Therefore, during the
period that this Emergency Law was in effect, from April 2010 to October 2011, the Procurement
Law was not binding. While the Government swiftly restored the capacity of the procurement
regulatory body, the CNMP, policy reform implementation has been slow ever since. As of early
December 2011, 14 of the 17 implementing decrees had been adopted, but only four had been
published, which delayed the effectiveness of the Procurement Law. The publication of these
signed decrees is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of the Law, and for the dissemination of all key
documents clarifying the procedures and key dispositions related to the new purchasing practices,

                                                  23
performance and conduct, the modalities and statutes to apply, and the regulations and policies
applicable to all facets of statewide purchasing authority.

71.     Observance of the Procurement Law requires addressing weak institutional capacity.
In addition to the effectiveness of the Procurement Law through the necessary implementing
regulations, compliance with good procurement practices requires adequate enforcement structures.
Line ministries had procurement units as required by the Law, but most of these units were barely
functional due to lack of staff, and were further weakened by the earthquake. Whereas there have
been some efforts to staff these units, as of January 2012, only nine of the 18 concerned ministries
had appointed members to their respective procurement units. And even within these, the capacity
to conduct competitive procurement using the procedures set in the new Law was lacking.
Furthermore, there was no code of ethics guiding officials involved in procurement activities, as is
the norm in other countries. The Bank is providing technical assistance through the Infrastructure
and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project and recent Additional Financing to enhance CNMP’s
capacity. In mid-2012, the CNMP organized a series of training workshops so that agents working
in existing procurement units and relevant officials could effectively use the various documents
underpinning the new legal framework.

72.     Improving procurement practices and transparency is dependent on line ministries
submitting annual procurement plans to the CNMP. Procurement plans would enhance
transparency in procurement practices and visibility for the CNMP in its role as regulator. The
CNMP had already begun assisting procurement units in line ministries to prepare and submit
procurement plans as required by the 2009 Law. However, this has not been completed, in part due
to the absence of effective procurement structures within line ministries.

73.     Reinforcing procurement regulation and line ministries’ procurement capacity is on
the Government’s priority list. It is critical for the Government to take swift action to
operationalize the procurement units in line ministries and accelerate the effectiveness of the 2009
Procurement Law in order to ensure compliance. This would help reduce significantly the risk of
irregularities in procurement practices as well as opportunities for corruption, and would increase
transparency. An example of weak governance is provided by the recent investigation carried out
by an Audit Commission into contracts processed under the 2010-11 Emergency Law. Requested
by former Prime Minister Gary Conille, an Audit Commission reviewed 41 contracts totaling more
than US$400 million, identified multiple irregularities, and concluded that state interests were not
adequately protected (note that none of these contracts were Bank-financed). The Government took
action to redress the weaknesses identified,9 sending a positive signal about the integrity of public
resource use and management, in addition to recouping and reallocating US$124 million in
investment resources from cancelled or restructured contracts.

74.    Addressing the irregularities in the 41 contracts reflects a degree of commitment by
the Government, but new concerns arose in the use of a new Emergency Law enacted after
Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Under the 2012-13 Emergency Law, in effect from October
30, 2012, to January 5, 2013, a large number of new contracts was issued using non-competitive

9
 Recommended corrective actions by the Government include, inter alia: suspending any of the 41 contracts for which
no disbursements have been made; checking the progress of work undertaken in relation to disbursements already
made; soliciting MPCE documentation relating to the 41 contracts reviewed; and requesting from the Central Bank the
bank statements of the Public Investment Program (PIP) for the period from November 1, 2010 to October 31, 2011.

                                                        24
procurement procedures. Some of these emergency projects were designed to redress as quickly as
possible the severe damages caused by the storm (equivalent to an estimated US$120 million
according to Government sources), and were procured using direct contracting or restricted bidding
procedures, as permitted under the Emergency Law. The Government made an initial allocation of
3bn gourdes (US$75M) for road and bridge repair and reconstruction related to Sandy damages.

75.     A significant share of these new contracts, while consistent with the legal provisions of
the Emergency Law, does not seem to be related to emergency repairs resulting from
Hurricane Sandy, however. During the two-month emergency period, the Government issued 92
contracts, of which only six appear in the Public Investment Program approved by Parliament.
Forty-five (45) of these contracts were for public works worth US$325M, representing over half of
MTPTEC’s total annual investment budget, and 47 were contracts relating to agriculture, equivalent
to US$32M or 15 percent of the Ministry of Agriculture’s annual investment budget. These
contracts could have benefited from the more rigorous investment review and appraisal and public
procurement processes prevalent outside emergency circumstances. On the positive side, details of
all these projects have been recently published on the MEF website, representing a significant
improvement in transparency. In addition, the great majority of the public works contracts will
contribute to strengthening the resilience of the national transport network. Furthermore, the
Government has for the first time allocated significant funds and signed supervision contracts to
oversee project implementation. Finally, the Government has committed to carry out ex-post
reviews of these projects, as indicated in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).

76.      Going forward, it will be important to close this potential loophole in investment
planning and procurement in order to maximize the value for money of public investment
and preserve the credibility of the Government’s reform efforts. Through the measures
supported by this Grant, more efficient procurement processes, aided by more effective and better
equipped institutions – the CNMP and the ministerial procurement units – will likely speed up
public investment, thereby reducing the potential benefits of resorting to emergency procedures.10
Furthermore, the Bank is launching a multi-country analysis of post-disaster PFM and procurement
experiences to better understand the range of practices and outcomes, and to draw potential lessons.
This analysis will be used to develop guidelines for the Haitian authorities – and for governments in
other disaster-prone countries – on effective ways to facilitate reconstruction in the aftermath of
natural disasters and at the same time ensure transparent and efficient public resource use through
sound PFM and procurement practices. Technical assistance under the Infrastructure and
Institutions Emergency Recovery Project has supported the development of the CNMP website, and
will help develop an information system to enhance record keeping and reporting of procurement
practices. Strengthening procurement remains on the Government’s agenda and is reflected in the
revised joint donor matrix agreed between the Government and the Joint Budget Support Group in
May 2013.

Specific Actions Supported by the Grant
Prior action 4. Pursuant to the Procurement Law dated June10, 2009, the Government has issued
and published on December 21, 2012 through its executive branch, the following two implementing
regulations (“arrêtés d’application?) covering respectively: (i) the code of ethics for officials

10
   Note that contracting using non-competitive procedures (e.g., single-source or shopping) can be justified under many
circumstances, and are permitted under the Procurement Law with the approval of the CNMP.

                                                         25
involved in procurement activities; and (ii) the standard documents for evaluating bids.11 All the
necessary components for implementing the Procurement Law are now in place, and the
Government is making the required efforts on the institutional side. This includes, for example, the
Government’s adoption and ready availability of standard forms for bid evaluations for procuring
works, goods or consultant services, which will facilitate efficient and accurate application of the
procurement requirements defined in the Law. International best practice for transparency and
accountability in public procurement includes a code of ethics for individuals responsible for
procuring goods and services using public resources, thereby providing guidelines and the basis for
enforcing compliance with the Procurement Law. In addition to being consistent with international
best practice, it also represents the best fit given Haiti’s current development stage. [Action
completed]

Prior action 5. All line ministries have established and staffed ministerial procurement units
(commissions ministérielles de passation des marches), and the Commission Nationale des
Marchés Publics (CNMP) has provided training to the staffs of such units. Strengthening the legal
framework is insufficient to ensure its application, given the weak capacity within the public sector.
In particular, procurement units within line ministries need to be operationalized, which requires
that these units not only be adequately staffed, but also have the necessary capacity and training to
carry out procurement activities and prepare procurement plans in compliance with the
Procurement Law. A series of trainings has been launched, with Module 1 completed in August
2012. Article 5 of the new Law requires acceptable procurement plans from each procuring public
entity before expenditures can be submitted to and approved by the CNMP. This practice will help
reduce waste and fraud and inform the budget process. For FY13, ten ministries accounting for over
four-fifths of public procurement prepared preliminary procurement plans, but none within the
required timeframe. The CNMP intends to continue its training modules developed to strengthen
the capacity in line ministry procurement units, and plans to organize a workshop targeted to all
concerned stakeholders in order to increase transparency and accountability. [Action completed]

Prior action 6. In order to improve public procurement practices, the Government has, in
accordance with the Arrêté dated February 16, 2005, and the Emergency Law dated April 19,
2010, rescinded 5 contracts awarded under the said Emergency Law. A specially named unit in the
Prime Minister’s office undertook a review of the implementation status of each of the 41 contracts,
on the basis of which it was agreed to terminate five contracts for which no disbursements had been
made (for a total of US$11 million). The Government’s right to terminate these contracts has legal
basis in the Arrêté dated February 16, 2005, and the Emergency Law dated April 19, 2010, as
described in the legal opinion communicated by the MEF to the Bank May 12, 2013. The 2009
Procurement Law contains provisions for legal recourse to injured parties to a terminated contract
to seek damages through the CNMP, or failing agreement, through the Court of Accounts. For the
contracts in question, no works were initiated, and no claims have been made to-date. [Action

Expected Outcomes
77.       Short-term. By the closing date of this Grant, it is expected that two-thirds of public
procurement contracts above the prior-review threshold signed after March 31, 2013, and outside of
periods of Emergency Law, are the result of competitive or limited bidding, using standard bidding
documents. This would represent a significant improvement compared to the baseline indicator of
less than one-third. Continuing technical assistance to the CNMP and the ministerial procurement
units will help to strengthen the application and culture of good procurement practices. All
procuring ministries are expected to submit their FY14 procurement plans to CNMP before October
31, 2013, as required by the Law. Furthermore, ministerial procurement units will submit quarterly
reports to CNMP on all procurement activity in their ministries in conformity with the Law,
including activity undertaken under the Emergency Law. This data can then be cross-referenced
with public investment execution information being tracked by the UEPs. The
forthcoming procurement review report for FY11 is expected to be published, potentially
generating demand for better outcomes from stakeholders, and the findings will be used to form a
baseline of comparison for analyzing effective enforcement of the Procurement Law in the coming
years.

78.    Medium-term. The medium-term objectives are that: (i) annual procurement reviews will
allow for an independent assessment of the performance of procurement institutions and processes;
(ii) competitive or limited bidding represents the great majority of signed public procurement
contracts and Emergency Law contracting procedures are strictly limited to projects directly linked
to the emergency; and, ultimately, (iii) transparency, efficiency and competition prevail in the
national procurement system.

               iii. Electricity Sector Governance and Performance
               Electricity sector reforms to improve governance and enhance EDH’s
               financial performance

79.     In order to unleash Haiti’s economic potential, it is crucial to address some of the main
obstacles for improved infrastructure and private sector profitability. Reliable electricity supply is
critical for improving citizens’ daily lives and livelihoods, attracting investment, and fostering
economic growth, and the Government’s plan to increase efficiency in electricity distribution, with
Bank support through electricity sector investments and complemented by the reforms in the
proposed Grant, will further generate budget savings for the state. The reforms also support
improved governance and public resource use in the sector.

Background and Sector Issues
80.     Due to a poor management system, the performance of the national, vertically
integrated electricity utility Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) has deteriorated over time. EDH has
been characterized by weak customer services and lack of infrastructure maintenance, which has
affected its revenue performance as well as the quality of electricity service and supply, including
frequent service interruptions and large voltage fluctuations. The sector’s institutional framework is
obsolete, sector policies are out of date, planning and monitoring of sector activities is inadequate,
and vested interests have impeded reform efforts, in particular by creating bottlenecks for installing
meters at IPPs. The compound effect of the earthquake on power generation, transmission, and
distribution further aggravated EDH’s weak performance. In 2011, bill collection rates were as low

                                                 27
as 65 percent while EDH’s losses stood at 65 percent of the electricity generated (of which
commercial losses represented nearly 40 percent). Only one-fourth of Haiti’s population has access
to electricity, and in rural areas, access is around 5 percent.

81.     EDH’s weak grid infrastructure, poor commercial performance, and inadequate
controls over sub-contracted electricity generation by independent producers (IPPs) have led
to a financial drain on Government resources. Due to its inability to meet electricity demand and
in an attempt to expand electricity availability, EDH has subcontracted part of the production of
electricity to IPPs.12 Unable to cover its operating expenses, including fuel costs and power
purchases in part because of low bill collection rates, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers from the
Treasury averaging US$100 million annually in recent years (equivalent to 10 percent of the
national budget and 1-2 percent of GDP).13 IPPs are expected to continue to play a major role in
power generation in Haiti. In particular, as the Government plans to expand electricity coverage to
support development of industry, trade and tourism zones, there would be increased demand for
reliable electricity.

82.      Past governance reforms to preserve the integrity of public resource management in
the electricity sector have produced modest results. The control system to check the accuracy of
IPPs’ bills was weak, both at the level of EDH and the Government. Ill-equipped, EDH could not
systematically check the power and energy produced by IPPs and there was no adequate
institutional set-up at the level of MEF and MTPTEC. The Government issued a joint-
memorandum from the MEF and the MTPTEC to clarify and strengthen the payment process and
the responsibilities of each entity involved in order to enhance transparency and control of the
accuracy of IPP claims. The memorandum signed in August 2012 by the Minister of Finance, the
Minister of Public Works and Energy and the Managing Director of EDH is intended to transfer
accountability and responsibility for IPPs to the state power company. It is also intended to foster a
proactive dialogue on the level of state support needed and the modalities of their transfer to EDH,
an essential component of budget planning for all parties. The enhanced verification process by
EDH has thus far saved an estimated US$11 million since January 2011. And in an effort to
enhance transparency in the sector, the Government has made some advances through the
publication of a monitoring table including key data, despite some irregularity and interruptions.14
Nevertheless, problems remain. The structures in place to review the data are ad hoc, the budget
transfer process is not fully effective, and the level of subsidy to be provided by the MEF to EDH
remains a contentious issue partly due to challenges in estimating EDH’s future revenue gaps. All
of these factors combined have caused delayed payments to IPPs and thus significant arrears and
interest penalties. In addition, the risk of overpaying IPPs remains high, given that EDH cannot
accurately measure the amount of power and energy delivered by IPPs.

83.    The Government has initiated a range of corrective measures to address challenges
related to sector performance, institutional capacity and financial viability, with Bank
support under the Electricity Loss Reduction Project. Subsequent to the 2010 earthquake, EDH

12
   IPPs provided 60 percent of total electricity generation in 2011.
13
    Electricity transfers are unbounded due to their dependence on international oil prices, electricity supply,
unsanctioned theft and bill non-payment, inter alia.
14
   The table, published on the MEF website, includes portions of updated data on: (i) payments by the State to each IPP,
as well as transfers to cover EDH fuel costs, (ii) payments by EDH to each IPP, (iii) energy produced by each IPP, and
(iv) amounts billed by each IPP during the period.

                                                          28
invested in strengthening management capacity in order to reduce its large technical and
commercial losses in a sustainable way. First, the Government contracted – through a competitive
bidding process – a new billing and customer management system (CMS – Consumer Management
System) and an operations and grid management system (TSMS – Technical Services Management
System).15 Supported by the Bank-financed Electricity Loss Reduction Project and fully operational
since February 2012, these systems include an inventory and monitoring of all EDH customers, and
a comprehensive resource management system.16 Secondly, since September 2010 four international
experts – also funded by the Bank-financed project – have been assisting EDH as deputy heads of
EDH’s commercial, financial, planning and technical departments. Thirdly, EDH started
rehabilitating existing power network infrastructure in 2011, including substations, feeders and
meters. Lastly, EDH has (i) designed and started the implementation of a comprehensive
Commercial Action Plan17 to significantly tackle commercial losses by September 2013, aiming to
reach a level of performance that will allow the company to end public transfer requests by 2016,
and (ii) initiated an extensive analysis of its prospective fundamentals (long-term demand forecasts,
sector master plan, least cost investment plan and tariff restructuring) and expects to present a
medium-term Energy Sector Financial Recovery Plan to the Government by September 2013.
These actions are key components of the energy sector reform agenda summarized in Box 2.

84.     Whereas these steps represent progress, they have so far not succeeded in generating
marked improvements in electricity service delivery and EDH’s financial performance. The
efforts to-date to improve EDH’s own performance would not generate the expected return unless
accompanied by significant investment spanning equipment, financial systems, and human
resources – all measures to be supported by the Bank’s recently approved US$90 million
Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure and Energy Access Project. It also requires efforts to stabilize and
gradually improve EDH’s technical and commercial performance, which could be achieved through
strengthening the EDH management team in charge of implementing the sector reforms and the
operational and investment programs. With respect to the management of IPP bills, the incentives
for EDH to ensure billing accuracy and operational efficiency are, in fact, weak because EDH
ultimately relies on the sovereign guarantee in the power purchase agreements (PPAs) and passes
on all costs to the central government rather than directly compensating IPPs. Improving the
management of public transfers and the accountability system in the sector will require a gradual
transfer of payment responsibility away from the Ministry of Finance directly to EDH through a
well-defined financial framework. It must be accompanied by investment in equipment for EDH to
enhance control over power and energy distributed by IPPs; this is being supported through the
purchase and installation of remote meters, another action financed by the Bank’s Electricity Loss
Reduction Project. The central government would have to continue to subsidize EDH operations
given the widespread poverty in Haiti and the critical role electricity plays in the economy, while

15
   The CMS will facilitate proper execution and monitoring of all commercial activities of EDH, in particular metering,
billing and collection. The TSMS aims to optimize attention to customer claims related to poor quality of electricity
supply, by helping reduce the time between receipt of claims and restoration of regular electricity supply, which is the
critical metric of service quality.
16
    The resource management system focuses on accounting, financial, and human resources management and
corresponding training; it is funded by the IADB.
17
   The Commercial Action Plan includes the following measures to improve EDH’s financial performance: reducing
fraud, increasing billing, performing controls on inactive residential and commercial customers, verifying consumption
of large inactive clients, dissuading partial payments, reducing the arrears of large private clients and autonomous
institutions, and installing remote meters.

                                                          29
                                      Box 2. Haiti Energy Sector Reform Agenda

 Haiti is following its letter of energy sector development policy to: (i) improve the technical, operational and
 financial performance of EDH; and (ii) strengthen policy and planning capacity to develop programs for expanding
 energy access. Addressing the financial performance issues on existing distribution networks will create fiscal space
 to expand services to under-served populations. The Government has undertaken a series of analyses and actions
 toward reducing the significant budget transfers provided to EDH. This is in line with a memorandum of
 understanding signed in April 2011 between the Government, IADB and the US Government to improve EDH’s
 operational and financial situation and analyze medium term alternatives. This agreement led to an operations
 improvement contract signed between private firm Tetra Tech and the Government to assist EDH management in its
 modernization process.

 Achievements to-date include: (i) a budget transfer protocol between the Ministry of Economy and Finance and EDH
 signed in August 2012; (ii) an EDH Commercial Recovery action plan (September 2012 to September 2013); (iii) an
 EDH Roadmap and Master Plan exercise (to be delivered in December 2013); and (iv) a Government Rural
 Electrification action plan. An active dialogue on the reform of the energy sector’s regulatory framework is
 complementing the Government’s efforts to update and improve the draft Energy Policy to provide a comprehensive
 strategy for electricity generation and distribution across the entire national territory.


EDH gradually transitions to sound financial footing, with the long-term objective that EDH will
ultimately be responsible for its own financial performance and service delivery.

85.     The improvement in operations management and in the management of IPP bills are critical
steps towards improved governance in the sector. As such, it is a prerequisite for any large
investment that would aim to improve the performance of the electricity sector. Achieving the
objectives of both energy sector projects funded by the Bank is greatly assisted by the enhanced
accuracy of private power generation levels, and may also benefit through better overall financial
performance of EDH. The combined impact of improved commercial management, private
generation control, and distribution infrastructure rehabilitation is expected to result in a gradual
reduction in public transfers to EDH, and the anticipated financial viability of EDH by 2016.

Specific Actions Supported by the Proposed Grant
Prior action 7. EDH has initiated the use of meter readings from functional remote meters newly
installed at IPP entry points to verify IPP production levels and billing. Twelve remote meters and
the remote metering system have been installed at IPP entry points and are monitored
independently by EDH. The instant metering of all independent producers is expected to improve
significantly the accuracy and transparency of the energy bills claimed by the IPPs. EDH will have
a verifiable basis for paying IPPs, and the Government will have the capacity to dispute or appeal
inaccurate billing. Once EDH power plants are also equipped with similar remote meters, the
instantaneous information provided will facilitate improving the entire electricity system’s
performance by allowing EDH to balance consumer demand with generation on an instantaneous
basis. [Action completed]

Prior action 8. EDH has performed on-site meter testing and verified meter readings for at least
200 priority customers, re-issued bills, and implemented arrears recovery plans when applicable.
Meters of over 200 priority customers18 – representing 8 percent of EDH’s total potential revenue –
were indicating “zero consumption?; this failure was symptomatic of a broader problem of

18
     The targeted consumers were mainly SMEs with a long irregular payment status.

                                                          30
insufficient and inaccurate billing and collection and widespread illegal connections. To-date, over
330 priority customers have been the object of meter testing, reading verification and re-billing,
resulting in US$262,000 in additional collected revenue. As illustrated in Figure 2, a diagnostic of
clients with “zero consumption? highlights malfunctions in customer management but also the
extent of fraudulent behavior. For example, for 15 percent of priority customers, zero consumption
was due to EDH failures (e.g., the meter or distribution line was removed), while 37 percent was
attributable to external reasons that were not properly accounted by EDH (e.g., the site was
permanently closed or destroyed by the earthquake). Another 24 percent of “zero consumption?
readings were accurate, explained by alternative privately-owned electricity generation capacity,
and one-tenth of “zero consumption? was attributed to fraud. These results suggest that closer
monitoring of EDH’s priority clients will improve the accuracy of meter readings and EDH
accounting, strengthen the relationship between the power company and its key consumers, and
improve commercial revenues. [Action completed]

Prior action 9. The Central Government, through the Ministry of Economy and Finance, has
settled all of its FY12 payment delays to EDH. The Ministry of Finance settled FY12 arrears
stemming from unpaid electricity bills and representing a cumulative US$6.9 million in September
2012. The symbolic aspect of this action – the payment of all Central Government electricity bills
for the previous fiscal year – sets an example for all public institutions in the same situation,
significantly improving EDH’s bill recovery rate for institutional customers. It also creates the
opportunity to establish a more regular payment process for institutional clients’ future electricity
bills and helps mitigate EDH’s cash flow challenges. [Action completed]

Expected Outcomes
86.    Short-term. By the closing date of this Grant, it is expected that the payment of IPPs’ bills
is based on production levels measured by remote meters and verified by EDH, which should
eliminate any unexplained discrepancies between IPP claims of energy generation and IPP

                                                   31
payments. It is also expected that billing of priority customers will be based on meter readings, and
that no new arrears by the Central Government to EDH for electricity consumption emerge.

87.     Medium-term. EDH is expected to continue investing in and installing meters at private
and EDH power plants’ delivery points in order to capture the amount of power delivered to the
network and improve reconciliation of bills with payments. In addition to these major
improvements in the sector, results from EDH’s Commercial Action Plan currently under
development as well as donor-funded investments in distribution infrastructure should allow the
state power company to reduce significantly its technical and commercial losses by the end of 2013
and beyond. The combined improvement on the production and consumption sides will contribute
positively to overall sector performance in the medium run, enhancing EDH’s financial
management capacity and strengthening its financial solvency. This in turn will create space to
invest in better distribution and metering infrastructure to provide reliable electricity services to
existing customers, as well as expanding access to new customers. This should also have a positive
impact on willingness to pay for quality service, and thus reduced illegal connections. Improved
cost recovery will also lead to a decline in public transfers from MEF to EDH over time.

                           VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. Participation Process
88.    The policy measures supported by the proposed Grant have been informed by various
government consultative processes involving relevant stakeholders. The proposed Grant
supports and draws from the government’s PARDH, which benefited from stakeholder
consultations conducted by the government at that time. This document outlines the main areas
addressed, including public financial management, procurement, and the electricity sector. Broad
consultation in the current environment is difficult. Nevertheless, in the energy sector there have
been consultations with many stakeholders including workers, unions, consumers and the
private sector.

89.     Extensive consultations were held throughout the first half of 2009 and the second half
2011 on the new Procurement Law and the PEFA report, respectively. With respect to
procurement, over several months, the government engaged in extensive consultation with civil
society and parliamentarians to ensure an inclusive process and to reconcile divergent views.
Furthermore, in March 2009 the CNMP organized a dissemination seminar to familiarize key
players, including representatives from different government agencies and the private sector, as
well as parliamentarians, academics and civil society representatives, with the provisions of the
law. Following the earthquake, in 2011 the CNMP organized a series of further seminars aimed at
familiarizing public entities with the various documents and materials supporting the implementing
decrees of the procurement Law. As for the PEFA report, the preparatory stages included a broad
consultation of government agencies, development partners, and the private sector in 2011, and the
PEFA results were disseminated subsequently in 2012 in a workshop in which the same broad
range of actors participated.

B. Poverty and Social Impacts
90.   The actions supported by this Grant are likely to have positive poverty and social
impacts. With respect to economic governance, strengthening budget execution will allow for

                                                 32
better control over expenditures, leading to more efficient allocations and better resource planning
to meet the needs of the Haitian population. These measures have the potential to make it easier to
scrutinize the extent to which voted budget allocations and actual public expenditures are in line
with the government’s stated objectives, which could in turn benefit the entire population, including
the poor. It could also provide a basis for assessing the effectiveness and impact of public
investment, informing public debate on future spending priorities. By upgrading the cash
management system to ensure the availability of cash for timely payment of the government’s
liabilities, fiscal savings will be generated through avoiding unnecessary borrowing costs. The
measures that support the implementation and enforcement of the new Procurement Law would
allow for increased transparency and accountability, crucial elements for fostering increased trust in
government institutions. The indirect impact of potential budget savings – either from more
efficient use of public resources or more effective cash management or more competition in public
procurement – could be significant by creating the fiscal space for the Government to expand
education, health and other social services and increase the sustainability of their financing.

91.     The actions supporting reforms in the electricity sector would translate into gains on
several fronts, including increasing electricity access and reliability, and improved financial
efficiency and fiscal loss mitigation, freeing up resources for socially sustainable policies. By
monitoring IPP production and paying only for metered generation, and by controlling, repairing
and monitoring the meters of its largest consumers, EDH will improve its commercial balances.
EDH’s bottom line will also be helped by the Government’s settlement of its payment delays for
electricity consumption in FY12. And through adherence to a subsidy transfer schedule from MEF,
EDH will be able to improve its cash management which would help it avoid late payments to
power suppliers. These potential gains could materialize if complemented by effective actions to
reduce technical losses and increase billing under EDH’s recently adopted Commercial Action
Plan. The expected result in the medium run is increased electricity supply to consumers, which
improves both quality of life and enhances livelihoods, particularly for the self-employed and small
business owners. The reduced fiscal burden on the Government would in turn free up resources for
more equity-enhancing programs including expanding electricity access to needy households in the
medium and long terms, and reducing the need of small and medium enterprises to rely on
alternative, more expensive sources of electricity such as fuel-based generators.

92.     Going forward, it will be crucial to monitor changes in poverty and living standards.
The new household surveys soon to be completed will provide a baseline for measuring poverty
rates, access to education and health services, and access to electricity, inter alia, factors that can be
tracked over time using future surveys or other tools.

C. Environmental Aspects
93.      The specific policies supported by the proposed Grant are not likely to have a
significant effect on the environment, forests or other natural resources. The proposed Grant
focuses primarily on institutional reforms, with no perceived negative environmental implications.
On the positive side, efficiency improvements in the electricity sector should help rationalize
electricity generation and consumption through a closer link between production and consumption
costs, as well as lead to increased access to less costly electricity in the medium run.




                                                   33
D. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
94.     Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will rely on the government with the aim of
strengthening government capacity and institutions. The MEF is the agency responsible for
coordinating and implementing the activities and reforms under the proposed Grant as set out in the
Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1). Sectoral progress will be monitored directly by the
relevant entities involved but will also benefit from indirect monitoring by MEF. A supervision
committee headed by MEF has been created to facilitate coordination, and MEF will be in charge of
reporting progress toward the target outcome indicators listed in the results framework of the policy
matrix in Annex 2. These easy-to-monitor indicators include the issuance of budget execution
reports, the number of public accounts at the Central Bank, submission of line ministries’
procurement plans to CNMP, and EDH’s use of meter readings in its payment of IPP bills and its
billing of priority customers. In parallel, collaborative monitoring of public sector and economic
governance and transparency has progressed among donors, with the government’s support. In
particular, implementation will be monitored as part of the joint donor matrix for budget support.

95.     Bank staff will monitor the outcomes of the program. If required, the more recent
country developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for realizing the intended
development goals would be taken into account. The review will be largely based on the monitoring
indicators and the goals of the program.

E. Fiduciary Aspects
96.    Public Financial Management System. A Public Expenditure Framework Assessment
(PEFA) was carried out in 2010 and concluded in February 2011. It provides a baseline for the
assessment of the country’s public financial management environment, identifying existing
weaknesses, and at the same time, acknowledging progress in strengthening fiscal discipline and
improving the efficiency of PFM.

97.     In spite of the visible improvement in the PFM environment over the last several years,
some critical weaknesses remain. As developed in the previous sections of this document,
progress has been made on the legal framework, the preparation and execution of the budget, the
control systems, and in the rationalization of cash management and government bank accounts.
However, weaknesses remain with respect to: (i) the content of the budget documents and the
usefulness of the budget as a planning tool, mainly due to the lack of a forward-looking perspective
in the budget; (ii) the need for stronger links between the budget for recurrent spending and the
investment budget; (iii) weak dialogue and coordination between the MEF, the Planning Ministry,
and spending ministries; (iv) the existence of off-budget revenues or aid inflows that finance some
ministries’ spending; and (v) the need to improve accounting and fiscal reporting, particularly the
inclusion of final investment expenditures, the timely reconciliation of accounts and preparation of
annual accounts.

98.    The IMF’s safeguards assessment dated January 18, 2011, noted that despite the
serious setback resulting from the earthquake, elements of the safeguards framework within
the Central Bank remain in place. However, the safeguards assessment also concluded that new
vulnerabilities emerged, particularly in the areas of governance, external audit and reserves
management. Measures that the BRH has adopted in light of the recommendations of the safeguards
assessment to address these vulnerabilities include the rotation of external auditors and the adoption

                                                 34
of a formal selection policy for external audits. The assessment also recommended the adoption of
reserves guidelines, to cover both reserves managed internally as well as reserves managed
externally. Other recommendations aim to strengthen the oversight bodies. IDA will therefore not
use additional fiduciary arrangements as per OP 8.60.

F. Disbursement and Auditing
99.     The proposed grant will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for development
policy loans/credits. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of
the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the grant is approved
by the Board and becomes effective, the Recipient shall open, prior to furnishing to the Association
the first request for withdrawal from the Financing Account, and maintain a deposit account in
Dollars ("Foreign Currency Deposit Account"). At the request of the borrower, the proceeds of the
grant will be deposited by IDA into a US$-denominated account designated by the Borrower and
acceptable to the World Bank at the Central Bank of the Republic of Haiti (Banque de la
République d’Haïti, BRH). The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Grant into said
account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower’s budget management system, in a
manner acceptable to the Bank. The Bank should obtain confirmation from the Government within
30 days after loan disbursement that (a) the loan proceeds were received into an account of the
Government that is part of the country’s foreign exchange reserves (including the date and the
name/number of the bank account into which the amount has been deposited), and (b) an equivalent
amount has been accounted for in the country’s budget management system (including the Chart of
Accounts name/account number, the date, and the exchange rate used). If the proceeds of the grant
are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Policy Grant Agreement, IDA will
require the Borrower to, promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the amount of
said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The
administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The
Bank retains the right to request an audit of the operation if needed.

G. Risks and Mitigation
100. The proposed operation takes place in a risky environment characterized by (i) weak
governance, (ii) strong political pressures, and (iii) inadequate institutional capacity. This
risk is, however, outweighed by the potential gains from advancing critical institutional
reforms by the Government of Haiti. The reforms supported by this Grant have the potential to be
transformational by laying the groundwork for strong economic governance systems as the country
transitions from post-disaster response to a medium-term development framework. Moreover, these
reforms are likely to be sustainable as they bring about institutional changes that are not easily
reversed. In addition, with the potential decline in external aid resources, strengthening Haiti’s
public resource management systems becomes even more important for mobilizing adequate
resources to finance development programs.

101. Political risks may interrupt the Government’s reform program, and/or weaken
reform implementation. The recent resignation of the Minister of Finance in April 2013 had the
potential to undermine confidence in the Government’s reform agenda and delay progress.
However, this risk did not materialize, as the rapid nomination of the sitting Minister of Trade and
Industry to the post was followed by his immediate endorsement of the Government’s ongoing
reform program. The pressure on policymakers to accelerate reconstruction to deliver results may

                                                35
lead to continued reliance on exceptional rules and Emergency Law loopholes for procuring large
public contracts. For example, the Government used post-disaster Emergency Laws to fast-track
public contracts and avoid competitive procurement rules for some activities unrelated to disasters.
This is one reason the Grant is judged to be high risk. And the risk is exacerbated by weak
institutional capacity. Whereas political risks are difficult to mitigate, the Government’s
commitment to key reforms helps reduce these risks. Key actions that demonstrate this commitment
include increased transparency in public contracting by making all contracts public, providing the
necessary resources and training to ensure the effective functioning of line ministries’ programming
and analysis units (UEPs) and procurement commissions, ex-post review of contracts passed under
the 2012-13 Emergency Law, comprehensive review and reform of EDH functions, and other
reforms agreed in the joint donor matrix. These actions help to keep the reform momentum and
ownership high and contribute to a more visible development impact.

102. Weak institutional capacity represents a significant risk to the Grant’s outcomes
because it may result in poor observance of governance principles in key areas including public
finance management and procurement, and may reduce the effectiveness of electricity sector
reforms. Haiti’s public sector institutions suffer from a legacy of inefficient budget and fiscal
management processes and inadequate human capital. The situation was made worse by the
destruction of records and physical and human capacity by the earthquake. The capacity of EDH is
also limited: its long-held monopoly and poor commercial practices have resulted in financial
dependence on the Government to cover its operating costs and led to inadequate maintenance of
and investment in infrastructure and service processes.

103. Some capacity has been built recently in the expenditure tracking and procurement
bodies and in EDH, and the measures supported by the proposed Grant significantly
reinforce and extend these institution-building efforts. With a functioning system to track public
investment spending (under the new Directorate of Public Investment and with UEPs in line
ministries) and a reduction in the number of public accounts, the Government will be able to
exercise tighter control over expenditures and cash flows as it moves toward a Single Treasury
Account. With widely available implementing regulations for procurement, and operational
procurement units in each line ministry, the Government will have increased its capacity for more
effective procurement, reducing its reliance on non-competitive bidding processes and increasing
transparency. The range of measures taken by EDH – e.g., validating IPP billing with electricity
meters, and ensuring accurate billing of its priority consumers – is already increasing EDH
revenues and thus reducing its reliance on the Government to meet any financing shortfalls.
Moreover, the success with meters has generated positive externalities for EDH in terms of
reviewing power purchase agreements and installing remote metering on other power plants,
effectively leading to a new paradigm in the electricity sector that reflects better governance.

104. The reforms supported by this Grant, through their focus on concrete short-term
institution-building measures that are achievable, enhance the systems for improved
Government efficiency, transparency and accountability in the medium term. As Haiti
emerges from the post-earthquake crisis response mode, it needs to strengthen the basic institutions
of economic management and governance to harness more effectively external and domestic
resources to accelerate economic growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity. A key step in
this direction, for example, is the reduction in the number of accounts that handle public funds –
and ultimately establishing a Single Treasury Account – which creates a solid framework for

                                                36
controlling and managing cash flows. The measures supported by the Grant are not easily
reversible, illustrated by the example that installed electricity meters provide the basis for accurate
billing both today and in the future. If the reforms succeed, they have the potential to create a strong
nexus of transparent and sound governance practices that contribute to better fiscal results through
less waste, better targeting of expenditures with a larger development impact, and increased
capacity in public resource management. This nexus will also contribute to better cost-recovery and
electricity generation and consumption monitoring by EDH, allowing it to invest in improved
electricity service and expanded access, with less drain on the Government budget. There will be a
growth pay-off as well; as the business environment becomes less risky, investors will have more
confidence and will be able to access reliable electricity service.

105. Given the significant gap between existing capacity and needs, and the inability to fully
mitigate risks, the expected outcomes of the Grant may not materialize. The risks associated
with limited implementation capacity and weak governance are at least partly mitigated by (i)
concentrating on a selected number of reform areas; (ii) ensuring that difficult reforms are taken
before Board approval; (iii) focusing on institution-building with embedded processes that are not
easily reversed; and (iv) providing adequate funding for critical actions through complementary
technical assistance. The proposed Grant represents one instrument in the Bank’s multi-pronged
approach comprising strategic investment lending and extensive technical assistance to build the
institutional framework and capacity in numerous government entities (recall Annex 5). The
proposed Grant is accompanied by technical assistance activities including: strengthening budget
and procurement institutions (through the Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery
Project); capacity building at the Inspection Générale des Finances (IGF) and the Court of
Accounts (under the Governance Partnership Facility); and improving energy sector policy and
planning capacity (under the Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure and Energy Access Project), inter
alia. The design of the proposed operation further mitigates risks by grounding the reforms in the
joint donor budget support matrix, a coordinated and comprehensive program of policy reforms
agreed jointly by core donors and the Government to help strengthen economic governance, and
PFM in particular. The proposed Grant supports a subset of reforms articulated in the joint donor
matrix. Finally, risks are also mitigated by the Bank’s engagement in a programmatic policy
dialogue on PFM, procurement and electricity reforms, facilitated by the proposed Grant.

                                   Re: Development Policy Grant to Haiti

Mr. President,

The Government of the Republic of Haiti hereby requests the support of the International Development
Association (IDA) to pursue the implementation of the reconstruction and development strategy elaborated
in Haiti’s Strategic Development Plan (Plan Stratégique de Développement d’Haïti - PSDH). This request
represents an update of the Letter of Development Policy dated April 17, 2013. The proposed Development
Policy Grant aims to: i) support the government’s strategies in their reconstruction effort, ii) help cover the
financing needs for reconstruction, iii) improve public expenditure effectiveness through the implementation
of performance and accountability measures, and iv) improve governance in the electricity sector. Pursuant
to this objective, the proposed program incorporates all the key design and implementation elements
necessary for accelerating Haiti’s reconstruction process.

        This letter provides a description of the macroeconomic context, as well as the objectives and
strategy of the above mentioned program.

A – Macroeconomic framework

        In recent years, there has been significant progress to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability.
Despite significant inflows of external aid in the wake of the January 2010 earthquake, cautious fiscal and
monetary policies contributed to keep inflation in single digits. The large foreign currency inflows helped
strengthen Haiti’s external position. In fact, at the end of September 2012, international reserves reached
US$2.2 billion, which represents 5.9 months of imports, above the usual three-months-of-imports rule.
Thanks to the reforms undertaken and the HIPC initiative and the MDRI which allowed a considerable
write-down of external debt obligations after the earthquake, the country’s level of indebtedness has declined
substantially.

        According to our projections for FY2013, the economic recovery should continue. Assuming greater
efficiency in public investment, the continuation of various projects aimed at promoting exports and tourism,
and a rebound of the agricultural sector, real GDP growth should reach 6.5% in FY2013. Overall year-on-
year inflation is expected to remain stable at around 5%. Domestic tax revenues are forecast to grow by 1.3
percentage points of GDP. Current expenditure should remain stable, while capital expenditure should


                                                      43
increase by 0.8% of GDP, reflecting accelerating reconstruction efforts. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit would
decline slightly to 5.4% of GDP, compared to 5.9% in FY2012.

         In 2010, the Government of Haiti entered into a 3-year IMF program under an Extended Credit
Facility. In December 2012, the IMF carried out the fifth review of the program and ascertained that its
implementation was satisfactory. In this framework, the IMF supports the Government of Haiti in its effort
to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework. It also makes provision for balance of payments
assistance to increase international reserves at the Central Bank of Haiti.

        The Government of Haiti intends to implement policies geared towards an acceleration of
reconstruction activities in a viable manner in the short and medium terms. Accordingly, the 2012-2013
budget aims at increasing revenues and allocating more resources to reconstruction-related activities while
boosting pro-poor expenditures. However, speeding up reconstruction activities will require a substantial
increase in capital expenditure to be financed, inter alia, by increased revenue mobilization efforts, external
resources and the issuance of treasury bills, in compliance with the IMF program.

B – Execution strategy and program monitoring

         In the framework of budget support requested by the Government of Haiti, it is anticipated that
actions be undertaken in two key domains critical for sustainable and balanced economic recovery. These are
public sector governance, and private sector development and economic growth. In particular, the program
for which the budget support is solicited will take into account institution strengthening and the
implementation of the regulatory frameworks in sectors that are deemed essential to reconstruction. To this
effect, the operation proposed by the Government specifically aims to: (i) strengthen public expenditure
management, (ii) improve the cash management system, (iii) strengthen the institutional framework and
capacity to effectively implement the Procurement Law, and (iv) strengthen economic governance of the
electricity sector.

         In recent years, the Government of Haiti made significant progress on the public finance
management front. Nevertheless, several challenges remain in order to transform the budget into a truly
strategic and effective tool to support the development objectives of the country. These challenges
principally concern the budget execution system. Consequently, the proposed program will address a number
of key actions in the domains of budget control and cash management.

Component 1: Strengthen the expenditure and cash management systems

         Given the scope of the reforms to be implemented, improving public finance management will
require a strategic planning effort over the long term. The Government recently discussed in an open forum
the PEFA report, which assessed the state of public finance reforms. It will serve as a reference for any
public finance reform in the short and medium terms. While acknowledging the significant progress made in
public expenditure management in the recent past, the PEFA report also recognizes persistent weaknesses in
certain key areas. First of all, in the past, budget preparation was reinforced thanks to consultations with the
line ministries and civil society during the preparatory phase of the budget. In an effort to correct the
identified weaknesses, the Government submitted the 2012-2013 budget to Parliament according to the
Constitution’s mandate. Later, budget execution was reinforced thanks to a reduction in the use of special
accounts. We anticipate other improvements with the adoption of a manual for budget execution, including a
more systematic application of the internal procedures for expenditure processing.

Component 2: Implementation of Procurement Law framework and enhancing the capacity of public
procurement management

        Following the adoption of a Procurement Law in 2009 and of four implementing decrees, progress
was made regarding public contracts. In December 2011, 14 new decrees were adopted. The publication of
these decrees allowed the dissemination of key documents clarifying procurement-related procedures and
provisions. However, these norms and procedures are not yet well known and integrated by users. In
addition to training and dissemination activities, the Government plans to undertake periodic reviews of
public procurement to ensure conformity with the procedures. In 2011, 41 contracts issued within the
framework of the Emergency Law adopted following the January 2012 earthquake were reviewed by an
Audit Commission (Commission d’Audit). In accordance with the recommendations of the Court of
Accounts, the Government reviewed the implementation status of certain contracts and cancelled those for
which no disbursements had been made. The Government is also committed to completing an ex-post
review of the contracts executed under the 2012-13 Emergency Law in effect from October 30, 2012 to
January 5, 2013. The CNMP will also continue to support the procurement units of procuring ministries in
the preparation and submission of public procurement plans, as required by the 2009 Law. The
Government’s priority is to reinforce procurement regulation and the public procurement management
capacity in these spending ministries. For both the Government and society in general, this would be a
means to prevent inefficient use of public resources. Thus, the Government of Haiti firmly commits itself to
increase transparency and accountability.

Component 3: Reform of the electricity sector to improve governance and financial performance of
EDH

        The energy sector must overcome serious institutional and infrastructure problems in order to
contribute to returning the country to the path of economic development and help improve the living
standards of its citizens. Only one fifth of the population of Haiti has access to electricity, and in rural areas,
access is less than 5%. The institutional framework of the sector is obsolete and the human and financial
resources are insufficient, which have led to frequent power outages. Unable to cover its operational costs,
EDH depends on budget transfers from the Treasury averaging US$100 million annually in recent years
(equivalent to about 10% of the budget). Technical and commercial losses are about 50%, and EDH
recovers only about 30% of the cost of the electricity it produces. Under its policy aimed at increasing the
availability of electricity, EDH subcontracts part of its electricity generation to independent producers.

          From the perspective of increasing the management capacity of EDH, the Government adopted a
series of measures related to the maintenance of the distribution network, the installation of remote meters
for its largest customers and for suppliers, the creation of an anti-fraud unit to improve EDH’s bill collection
rate, and contracting an international firm to help strengthen EDH’s management system. The Government
demonstrates greater transparency in budget transfers to EDH by its implementation of a monitoring
mechanism and the disclosure of key indicators on the functioning of EDH. Finally, the Government is
working to expand access to and a reliable supply of electricity through the rehabilitation of generation and
distribution infrastructure.

         The Government reiterates its commitment to work with your institution, particularly to pursue its
policies to strengthen good governance and transparency. The Government of Haiti would like to thank you
for your consideration of this request.

                          UNDER ECF ARRANGEMENT FOR HAITI
                     AND APPROVES US$7.4 MILLION DISBURSEMENT

Press Release No. 13/76
March 13, 2013

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the fifth review of
Haiti’s performance under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement on March 11, 2013.
Completion of the review will enable an immediate disbursement of SDR 4.914 million (about
US$7.4 million), bringing total disbursements under the program to date to SDR 36.036 million
(about US$54.1 million).

Haiti’s ECF arrangement was approved on July 21, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/299) together
with the full relief on the country’s outstanding debt to the Fund of about SDR 178 million
(equivalent to US$268 million). The debt relief, financed by the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief

(PCDR) Trust Fund, and IMF financing are part of a broad international strategy to support
Haiti’s longer-term economic reconstruction plans, following the devastating earthquake of
January 12, 2010.

Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, IMF Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Board Chair, issued the following statement:

“Haiti’s performance under the ECF-supported program continues to be broadly satisfactory.
Sound policies have contributed to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability. However,
economic activity remains subdued, reflecting limited absorptive capacity, a business
environment that needs to be strengthened, and frequent natural disasters.

“In the short-run, the key challenge is to accelerate reconstruction and sustain the recovery
following the 2010 earthquake, while safeguarding macroeconomic stability. Looking ahead,
macroeconomic policies and structural and institutional reforms to enhance the country’s
resilience, particularly to natural disasters, will also be needed to protect long-term growth,
reduce unemployment, and raise living standards.

“Efforts should focus on optimizing fiscal policy for higher and inclusive growth, particularly by
expanding fiscal space for development spending, improving the execution rate and quality of
capital spending, and strengthening public financial management. Maintaining price stability and
facilitating external adjustment should also remain key priorities.

“Accelerating the pace of structural reforms will be important to enhance competitiveness,
safeguard external stability and achieve higher and more inclusive growth. Efforts should focus
on enhancing the business environment, particularly by removing infrastructure bottlenecks,
increasing transparency and improving governance, and deepening financial intermediation.?

The updated DSA was prepared jointly by the Fund and Bank staffs in accordance with the Joint
Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries (LICs).22 HIPC and
MDRI debt reliefs have been complemented with additional debt relief to help Haiti overcome
the devastating earthquake of January 2010. As a result, Haiti’s external debt burden has been
significantly reduced (with the PV of debt to export ratio—the most critical sustainability
measure—falling below 50 percent at end-2011). However, over the medium-term, rapid debt
build up is expected, and the PV of debt to export ratio will reach the sustainability threshold of
100 percent of exports in 2017. Over the long-term, the PV of debt to export ratio will remain
above 100 percent (peaking at 129 percent in 2024). Consequently, the staffs continue to assess
Haiti’s risk of debt distress as being high.23 The narrow export base continues to challenge
Haiti’s debt sustainability; no standard stress test leads to a breach of any thresholds with the
exception of the PV of debt to export threshold, which is breached in all six standard stress tests.
In the most extreme stress test (the combination shock), the PV of debt to export ratio peaks at
195 percent in 2019. This stress test points to the need to continue to carefully monitor the
evolution of external debt.




21
    Note that this analysis was completed assuming a higher baseline GDP compared to current estimated GDP for
FY12 and FY13, but the debt projections are not materially affected. Only the timing of the projected breach of the
sustainability threshold of 100 percent of exports would change.

   Haiti is classified as a weak performer based on its three-year 2008-10 average score of 2.90 in the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) framework. For weak performers (defined as those with three-
year average CPIA ratings below 3.25), the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are PV debt-to-GDP
ratio of 30 percent, PV debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent, PV debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent, debt service-
to-exports ratio of 15 percent, and debt service-to-revenue ratio of 25 percent.

4.1.    Haiti’s nominal external public debt as of end-2011 was US$657 million
(Text Table 1).24 In present value (PV) terms, the external public debt was US$479 million or
the equivalent of 48 percent of exports, 50 percent of government revenue, and 7 percent of
GDP. Haiti’s external creditors are Venezuela (71 percent of total nominal debt),
Taiwan Province of China (14 percent), the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) (10 percent), the IMF (4 percent) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) (2 percent). The structure of external debt has undergone a significant change
in recent years: the share of debt owed to traditional development partners has dropped owing to
debt relief, while the share of debt owed to non-Paris Club bilateral has increased reflecting
continued new disbursements from Venezuela.

4.2.    Haiti’s external debt burden has been significantly reduced owing to debt relief.
After having earlier benefitted from HIPC/MDRI-related debt relief, Haiti received additional
debt relief following the devastating earthquake in January 2010. This debt relief include the
following initiatives:

        The IMF extended debt relief in July 2010 to Haiti in the amount of SDR 178.13 million
         (about US$268 million) from the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust.25

24
  Unless otherwise noted, data are presented on a fiscal year basis. Haiti’s fiscal year ends in September.
25
  Established in June 2010, the PCDR Trust allows the Fund to join international debt relief efforts when poor
countries are hit by the most catastrophic of natural disasters. Debt relief under the PCDR Trust frees up additional

       The World Bank provided debt relief on Haiti’s outstanding debt of SDR 24.3 million
        (about US$36 million as of May 21, 2010). The debt relief became effective in May 2010
        when the 14 donors to the Debt Relief Trust Fund agreed to allocate the resources needed
        to cover the debt cancellation.

       The IDB provided debt relief in the amount of US$486 million. The debt relief was
        approved in March 2010 and delivered in October 2010 upon receipt of committed donor
        financing.

       The IFAD has established a Haiti debt relief account into which donors contribute funds.
        Pending the receipts of sufficient funds to cancel Haiti’s debt to IFAD, current debt
        service falling due to IFAD is paid from this account. Currently, the debt relief account
        holds sufficient funds to service Haiti’s debt to IFAD through 2020.

       Venezuela cancelled all outstanding PetroCaribe-related debt as of January 25, 2010 in
        the amount of US$395 million. This debt relief included a cancellation of the end-

        September 2009 stock of debt (US$295 million) and disbursements over the October
        2009—January 2010 period (US$100 million).

       Taiwan Province of China waived interest payments for a period of five years. It also
        agreed to shift back the schedule of principal repayments by five years.

4.3.    The Central Government’s domestic debt to state-owned enterprises amounted to G1.9
billion stemming mainly from recent agreements about the settlement of past payments of goods
and services received. The non-financial public sector is a net creditor to the consolidated
banking system (G 12.3 billion as of end-2011) mainly reflecting the central government’s
unspent balances in the IMF Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief account (G 10.8 billion) and in the
PetroCaribe account (G 11.6 billion).

resources to meet exceptional balance of payments needs that arise from such catastrophes and subsequent economic
recovery efforts. The Trust was initially financed by SDR 280 million (equivalent to around $422 million) of the

                      Box 4.1. Macroeconomic Assumptions (as of February 2012)
      Growth and inflation. In 2011, real GDP recovered from the earthquake-related contraction
      in 2010. Major reconstruction projects and buoyant exports will jumpstart growth in 2012 and
      2013.26 Over the medium term, several large infrastructure projects and the adoption of
      efficiency-enhancing reforms of the public sector are expected to foster a more enabling
      environment for private sector-led growth and buttress the economy’s resilience to shocks.
      Long-run growth is assumed to be 4.5 percent underpinned by an ICOR of 5.1. High food and
      fuel prices pushed up consumer prices in 2011. Inflation is expected to revert to the low,
      single-digit level from 2013 onwards.
      Fiscal policy. The overall balance deficit is 7.7 percent in 2012 and 5.8 percent in 2013. Over
      the medium term, it gradually decreases to 2.9 percent in 2032. Domestic revenues will
      increase gradually from 13.1 percent of GDP in 2011 to 16.9 percent of GDP in 2023 (and
      remain constant thereafter), thanks to the implementation of a recently launched reform
      program to overhaul revenue administration, increase excise taxes and streamline direct
      taxation. Whereas capital expenditures are projected to gradually decline from 26 percent of
      GDP in 2012 to 10 percent of GDP in 2032, current primary expenditures will remain constant
      at 10-11 percent of GDP.




                                                                                                         53
      Grants and financing. Donor assistance (grants, including humanitarian assistance, and
      concessional loans, but excluding debt relief) was close to US$3 billion in 2010 and US$2
      billion in 2011. This assistance is projected to gradually decrease to US$1.3 billion by 2017.
      Beyond donors’ commitment horizon, it is assumed that assistance will continue at the level
      of US$1.3 billion annually (with a grant/loan mix of 60/40 percent). Following the
      introduction of a Treasury-bill market in 2011, residual domestic financing needs—i.e.,
      domestic financing less drawings from the PCDR account (expected to be fully drawn down
      by 2015) and PetroCaribe account (discussed in Box 4.2)—will be met through the issuance
      of Treasury-bills. The majority of those are expected to be bought by local commercial banks,
      as T-bills are set to replace Central Bank bills currently issued for monetary policy. It is
      assumed that such debt carries a rate of interest of 5 percent.
      Current account. Exports rebounded strongly in 2011 and buoyant growth is expected to
      continue through 2013 driven by investments into the textile sector. In contrast, import
      demand will remain subdued as the international support for post-earthquake reconstruction
      winds down. Over the long term, it is assumed that the real export (real import) elasticity with
      respect to real GDP is 1.2 (0.8). Workers’ remittances are conservatively assumed to increase
      4 percent annually (below the expected increase in salaries in the US, which is the main
      source of remittances). The product-weighted average oil import price is projected to be
      US$124 per barrel in 2012 and the price is assumed to stay constant over the projection
      period. Consequently, the current account deficit excluding grants is projected to fall from
      30 percent of GDP in 2010 to 20 percent of GDP in 2013, and then to 9½ percent of GDP (the
      pre-earthquake deficit level) by 2020.

      Capital and financial accounts. The capital account surplus is projected to average 4 percent
      of GDP over medium term. In the early years, the capital account is dominated by public
      sector inflows, but private sector inflows will dominate the capital account from 2021
      onwards. The private sector inflows are expected to be mostly in the form of FDI; by 2032,
      the stock of private sector external liabilities will be close to 35 percent of GDP.

4.5.    Following the delivery of debt relief, most bilateral development partners and
multilateral development banks have shifted to providing assistance on a grants-only basis.
Major new disbursements are those related to the PetroCaribe agreement with Venezuela (see
Box 4.2). Other disbursements are limited to those financed by OPEC, the ongoing airport
renovation project financed by Venezuela’s Economic and Social Development Bank
(BANDES),27 and the existing IFAD project pipeline.28

4.6.    Various changes to the baseline macroeconomic framework have been introduced
since the previous DSA (Text Table 3) to take into account recent domestic developments,
the current more troubling international outlook, and the government’s revised long-term
strategy.29 Exports, imports, gross workers’ remittances and official transfers have been revised
down. Consistently, the long-run real GDP growth rate has been slightly lowered from
5.0 percent to 4.5 percent. In contrast, the fiscal stance is broadly unchanged, but the projected
increase in revenues has been brought forward to reflect the authorities’ strong commitment to
raise revenue collection, and reduce the country’s dependency to donor support.

  Under the PetroCaribe Agreement, Venezuela finances part of Haiti’s fuel import bill.
  The oil import bill is divided into a portion that is paid for in cash (the ‘cash’ portion) and a
  portion that is paid for through an extension of a loan (the ‘loan’ portion).
   The ‘cash’ portion represents a suppliers’ credit that must be settled within 90 days (that
      credit is interest free the first 30 days and carries a two percent annual interest rate over
      the remaining 60 days).
   The ‘loan’ portion is a function of the oil
      price; this portion varies from 5 percent of Terms      of Venezuelan's Loans under the Petrocaribe Agreement

      of the ‘loan’ portion is also a function of
      the oil price. At oil prices up to US$40 per barrel, the loans have a 17-year maturity and
      carry a two percent rate of interest. At higher oil prices, the maturity is extended to 25
      years and the rate of interest is lowered to one percent. At any oil price, the maturity of
      the loans includes a two-year grace period.
  The local currency counterpart of the PetroCaribe credits is deposited in the domestic
  banking system. The funds are under the control of the central government and all
  transactions are fully captured in the fiscal accounts. Disbursements are recorded as external
  financing of the budget with an offsetting negative domestic bank financing entry. When the
  central government draws down the funds to finance its capital expenditure budget the
  (negative) domestic financing line is reduced accordingly. The authorities have committed to
  only use PetroCaribe resources to finance growth-enhancing investment projects; however,
  funds have also been used to finance transfers to the loss-making energy company EDH. In
  2012-13, projected disbursements from the account are based on the expected rate of
  implementation of the existing project pipeline and a phasing out of electricity subsidies.
  From 2014 onwards, no electricity subsidies are envisaged and project disbursements are
  assumed to remain constant in real terms subject to availability of financing (by 2020 the
  PetroCaribe account has been fully drawn down). General budgetary resources are used to
  service the debt to PetroCaribe.
  The PetroCaribe agreement allows for the financing of up to 14,000 barrels per day (on
  an annual basis). As Haiti currently exceeds this level of imports, financing is solely a
  function of price. With an assumed constant oil price over the medium term (at the projected
  product-weighted average oil price of US$124 per barrel in 2012), PetroCaribe disbursements
  remain constant at US$330 million a year. These disbursements will lead to a significant
  build- up of new debt over time. The steady-state level of debt to PetroCaribe will be
  US$4,620 million from 2036 onwards.


4.7.    The outlook for the debt built up has also been updated. Over the 2012-17 period,
total disbursements have been revised up from US$1.8 billion to US$2.1 billion to incorporate
larger PetroCaribe-related inflows (US$2 billion). Beyond donors’ commitment horizon,

                                                               55
                                                           


projections are more speculative. The current DSA maintains the assumption that international
assistance over the long run will continue at a level of US$1.3 billion annually. However, in light
of the current pressures on aid budgets, the average grant element of this assistance has been
lowered from 89 percent to 74 percent by changing the grants/loan mix from 83/17 percent to
60/40 percent. The assumptions on future borrowing are realistic given that the expected
improvement in Haiti's economic outlook and the resulting buoyancy of the economy will stretch
ODA needs (and opportunities) beyond what pure grant funding can cover, and the projected
increases in ODA will not breach the concessionality criteria.

4.8.    Haiti’s debt situation has significantly improved as a result of debt relief
operations.30 The outlook for Haiti’s debt, however, has not improved as prospects now are for a
more rapid build-up of debt in the context of a weaker capacity to carry such debt. Over the long
run, the PV of debt to export ratio will consistently exceed 100 percent (peaking at 129 percent
in 2024) and all six standard stress tests lead to a breach of the PV of debt to export sustainability
threshold. In the most extreme stress test (the combination shock), the PV of debt to export ratio
peaks at 195 percent in 2019. Among the four standard shocks that constitute the combination
shock, the export shock is the more serious. In contrast, the sustainability thresholds relating to




                                                                                                                         56
the PV of debt to GDP and the PV of debt to government revenue are not breached even in the
most extreme stress test. Similarly, the debt service sustainability thresholds are not breached in
the most extreme stress test.

                        III.      Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis

4.9.    In the baseline scenario, the public sector PV debt burden continue to increase over
the projection period reaching 32 percent of GDP or 189 percent of revenue by 2032. The
external debt to GDP ratio falls from 2024 onwards reflecting increasing repayments to
PetroCaribe. In contrast, domestic debt increases gradually over the projection period from less
than 1 percent of GDP in 2011 to 16 percent of GDP by 2032.

                                          IV.      Debt Management
4.10. The Public Debt Directorate—located in the Ministry of Finance’s Directorate-
General for the Budget—is the focal point for public debt management. The January 2010
earthquake seriously disrupted the functioning of the debt management office: the building was
destroyed, some data were lost and computer systems were impaired. Staff has now been
relocated to new prefabricated offices. While computer systems have been partially restored,
there are ongoing problems with network connectivity.

4.11. Steady progress is being made to enhance the Public Debt Directorate’s operational
capacity. The Directorate uses the electronic UNCTAD’s Debt Management and Financial
Analysis System (DMFAS) debt recording system and its capacity to produce debt sustainability
analyses has been enhanced through the delivery of technical assistance from the Center for
Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA). Work is ongoing to establish fully operational

30
  The extended debt relief was anticipated and the current baseline DSA is broadly similar to the debt relief scenario
included in the previous DSA report.

middle and back office functions within the Directorate. The legal framework for borrowing is
not clearly defined, but the government is currently receiving technical assistance from CEMLA
as well as the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) to set up such a
framework. A public debt law establishing a sound legal and institutional framework for public
debt management is expected soon to be submitted to parliament (a structural benchmark for
end-March in the ECF-supported program).

4.12. The Public Debt Directorate and the External Debt Unit in the Central Bank’s
International Affairs Directorate collaborate closely. The two organizational units exchange
information frequently and jointly prepare debt service projections. The Central Bank is
currently receiving technical assistance from UNCTAD to improve compilation of statistics on
external private commercial debt.

                                        V.      Conclusion
4.13. As a result of debt relief, Haiti’s external debt burden has been significantly reduced
since 2009. However, the outlook is for a significant build-up of new external debt. The narrow




                                                                                                       57
export base remains the Achilles’ heel of Haiti’s debt sustainability: the PV of debt to export
ratio exceeds the 100 percent sustainability threshold from 2017 onwards. Thus, Haiti’s debt
situation still remains vulnerable, and, consequently, the staffs continue to assess Haiti’s risk of
debt distress as being high.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
