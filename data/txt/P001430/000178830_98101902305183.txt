INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TCi THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FOR. A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$13.8 million to the Republic of Liberia to help
finance a fourth highway project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7.5 percent per annum. The
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economaic Development would co-finance the project on a
parallel basis with a loan of about US$7.4 million equivalent. 1/
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.  Its report
"Liberia: Growth with DeveLopment - A Basic Economic Report" (No. 426a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors. An economic
report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Liberia" (No.
1642a-LBR) dated February :28, 1978 has been distributed to the Executive
Directors.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings. Iron ore mining is by far the largest
single activity in the enclave sector, accounting for about one third of
gross domestic product at factor cost. There are only limited linkages be-
tween the enclaves and the rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits
of economic growth have been unevenly distributed.
4.        Another dimension of structural imbalance is the disparity between
traditional agriculture and the (monetized) modern sector. Traditional agri-
culture has minimal inter-action with the rest of the economy; however, it
supports the majority of the population - as much as 60 percent - who live at
or near subsistence level. With a population of about 1.6 million, average
per capita GNP in 1976 was US$450. While the enclave sector yields a per
capita GDP of about US$2,500 compared to US$550 for the rest of the monetized
economy, the great majority of the population who live in the traditional non-
monetized sector have a per capita income of about US$100 per annum. To help
redress these imbalances the Government is trying to increase its earnings
from the concessions and use the resources to diversify the economy with
increased participation by, Liberians.
1/   The precise amount and terms of the loan from the Kuwait Fund has not
yet been determined.



-2-
Development Plan
5.        The Government has prepared a Four-Year Development Plan covering
the period July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1980. In preparing the Plan the Govern-
ment was assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Government (Reference: President's Memorandum to
the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The Plan identi-
fies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic development
as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sustainable socio-
economic activities throughout the country; (c) greater involvement of
Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distribution of the
benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable standard of living
for the people throughout the country. The average annual growth of real GDP
during the Plan period is envisaged at around 6.8 percent. However, because
of delays in the implementation of expected investments in iron ore mining
and some slackening in demand for the country's main exports, the recent Bank
economic mission has estimated that real growth during the four-year period
is unlikely to exceed 3-4 percent. Total development expenditure is projected
at US$415 million, of which US$251 million would be financed from foreign
sources and US$164 million domestically. Firm commitments accounted at the
start of the Plan for almost 60 percent of the expected foreign financing.
However, the Plan is currently being revised to take account of developments
during the first two years. This review is not yet complete but it is clear
that the cost of the public investment program will increase substantially
largely to reflect increased costs but also the inclusion of additional
projects. Actual development expenditures over the first two years of the
Plan are estimated at about $200 million. Given the financial, manpower and
institutional constraints it is likely that the implementation of a number of
the projects, as revised, will be delayed beyond the Plan period.
6.        The Development Plan attaches high priority to the development of
agriculture and basic infrastructure. The objective is to diversify and
modernize agricultural production, increase productivity, improve associated
rural economic activities such as marketing and processing, and provide social
and physical infrastructure to promote income distribution and improve the
quality of life in the rural as well as urban areas. The Government has
already embarked on two important agricultural development projects in the
Bong and Lofa counties which are being assisted by the Bank Group. Other
projects in forestry and rubber are expected to start shortly which will lead
to greater participation of Liberians in the development of the country's
principal agricultural resources. At the same time the Government plans to
expand water supply and electric power utilities in both urban and rural areas
and to improve the road network, the inadequacy of which presently constitutes
a constraint to growth. However, the shortage of adequately trained manpower
at all levels is likely to prove the most important constraint to the Govern-
ment's efforts to develop and diversify the economy. The Government is keenly
aware of this and has adopted a number of policy measures, supported by the
three Bank Group financed education projects, to tackle the problem. However,



-3-
by their very nature, these policies are likely to bear fruit only in the
long term; over the short amd medium terms, the Government will have to rely
heavily on foreign technical assistance.
Recent Economic Developmen:s
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries, was
hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong world
demand for Liberia's major export, iron ore, brought large gains in export
prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries signifi-
cantly reduced the demand Eor the country's most important export commodi-
ties -- iron ore, rubber anad timber. With growth performance continuing to be
largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real GDP -- which averaged
about 6.4% a year in the 1967-1970 period has slowed down significantly and is
estimated to be about 3.0% in 1976. Preliminary estimates indicate that GDP
growth may have declined further during 1977.
8.        Liberia has had a long history of sound fiscal management and public
sector resources have not come under undue pressure during the past decade.
A satisfactory growth in government revenues averaging about 13.5% per year
between 1970-1975 enabled the Government to finance increasing expenditures.
Recurrent expenditures during this period grew by about 10% while development
expenditures increased nearly fourfold. However, public sector finances have
recently come under increased pressure which is likely to continue over the
medium term mainly because of an anticipated acceleration in the rate of growth
of government expenditures coupled with a more moderate rate of growth in reve-
nues. The rate of growth of government revenues is likely to be moderate in
view of the anticipated lower GDP growth rate as well as the continued slack
in world demand for iron ore. There may be scope for an increased revenue
effort on the part of Government as well as improvements in the efficiency
and pricing policies of the public corporations so as to ease the pressure
on central government finances. In this context, Government has recently
enacted a new Revenue and Finance Law and is also negotiating with the iron
ore companies regarding its share in profits and future dividend distribution
policies.
Balance of Payments
9.        During the 1964-1972 period, merchandise exports grew by 10% and
imports by 5.9% annually in current prices. Thereafter, from 1972-74, mostly
reflecting accelerated international inflation, imports rose by 29% annually,
exceeding the 22% annual export growth.  Oil imports increased from US$12
million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974. From 1975 onwards the decline in
the quantity of exports has been partly offset by favorable movement in the
terms of trade but the trade surplus nevertheless declined from US$110
million in 1974 to US$61 million in 1976, while the current account deficit
reflecting the substantial remittances of capital and other factor income
from enclave operations recorded about US$93 million in 1976 as compared with
US$30 million in 1974. The rising current account deficits have been financed
mostly by private capital transactions.



-4-
Creditworthiness
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was esti-
mated at about US$199 million as of December 1976. Debt service payments as
a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor services were estimated at
4.3% in 1976 as compared to 5.7 and 7.7% for 1974 and 1972 respectively.
Debt service payments as a percentage of government revenues have also dec-
lined from 24.3% in 1972 and 21.1% in 1974 to 13.4% in 1976. Based on the
existing debt, both ratios are projected to increase gradually in the next few
years as export earnings are expected to level off and the public revenues
grow more moderately. The Bank Group share of the public debt outstanding
and disbursed is presently about 18%. Liberia's debt service ratio through
the 1980s is expected to remain relatively modest (below 10%) unless there
is an unexpected deterioration in external conditions. In this context, it
should be noted that Liberia's exports are highly concentrated in a few
commodities (mainly iron ore and rubber) with unstable world market prices.
Given the country's satisfactory performance in economic management and its
modest debt service ratio, Liberia should be regarded as creditworthy for a
significant amount of Bank lending, blended with some assistance from IDA.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made 15 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$84.5 million; there have been 6 IDA credits
totalling US$30 million and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000
for development planning. IFC has made two equity investments totalling
US$555,000 in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (LBDI). The Bank loans have been mainly for roads, port expansion,
power and LBDI; IDA credits have been for education and agriculture. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments
as of March 31, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:  (a) to help Liberians
to play a larger role in developing their own resources for the benefit of
their own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader
sharing of the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in
broadening the economic base and overcoming infrastructural constraints to
growth; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development resources
from other external agencies. In furthering these objectives, particular
attention is being paid to the need to expand the supply of trained manpower
so as to relieve this potential constraint to development.
13.       In line with the priorities established in the Government's Four-
Year Development Plan, the Bank plans to give increasing emphasis in its
lending program over the next few years to the agricultural sector. The
Bank Group is co-financing with USAID two agricultural projects currently



-5-
under implementation in Bong and Lofa Counties. These projects are designed
to assist a total of about 17,000 subsistence peasant farmers to diversify
their production base and to increase their productivity and income through
the provision of an integrated package of support services and infrastruc-
ture. A rubber project has recently been approved which would lead to
expanded exports, increased productivity and incomes for small and medium
size farmers, strengthen credit and extension service and promote greater
Liberian participation in the development of this sub-sector. A forestry
project has been appraised which would strengthen the Government's forest
service, initiate an industrial plantation program and help Liberia to better
manage and exploit its forestry resources.
14.       In infrastructure, a water supply project is under preparation
which would rehabilitate and expand the Monrovia water supply system, extend
water distribution to lower income groups in the metropolitan area, and
help strengthen the management and finances of the Liberia Water and Sewerage
Corporation. The proposed fourth highways project would rehabilitate about
100 miles of priority sections of selected primary roads and provide technical
assistance for road maintenance. In addition, a feeder road project is under
preparation which would help expand Liberia's feeder road network in support
of the Government's agricultural and rural development programs. In the power
sector, a fourth power project is under preparation which would expand the
Liberia Electricity Corporation's thermal power generating facilities to meet
demand until a new hydro-electric generating facility has been constructed
and made operational around 1985. In the social sector, three education
projects have been financed by the Bank Group. The first two projects aimed
at improving secondary education, education planning and management, as well
as extending the educational system to rural areas through the provision of
secondary schools and 45 village community schools. The third project which
was approved in May 1977 emphasizes vocational and technical training, and
will assist in increasing the supply of trained manpower. The Bank is plan-
ning to follow this up with a manpower sector survey.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Sector Characteristics
15.       The transport infrastructure consists of about 4,900 miles of road
(of which some 1,450 miles are maintained by the enclaves), three railways
totalling 300 miles maintained and operated as part of the iron ore con-
cessions, four sea ports and about 15 airfields. Many of the enclave roads
are available for public use; they are for the most part built and maintained
to a high standard. Public roads on the other hand are - with the exception
of some lengths of main road near Monrovia - inadequate in standard for the
increasing traffic. The number of registered vehicles increased at some
11 percent per year over the decade 1960-70 but slowed down thereafter. There
are currently estimated some 21,00 motor vehicles registered for use in the
country, i.e. 14 per thousand population.



-6
16.       At present, the major transport flows reflect the pattern of eco-
nomic activity; the transport demand i8 mainly based on iron ore and timber,
followed by rubber and other agricultural products, fuel and imported goods.
Railroads carry some 20-25 million tons of iron ore annually to the Ports
of Monrovia and Buchanan; the shallow water ports of Greenville and Harper
handle mainly log export, Road transport is unevenly distributed; more than
half of all road transport, the predominant mode for passengers and goods
other than iron ore, is concentrated around the Monrovia region and along
the Monrovia-Ganta axis. Internal air transport is negligible and commercial
coastal shipping non-existent.
Sector Objectives and Constraints
17.       The Government's objectives for the transport sector are presented
in the National Socio-Economic Plan 1976-1980. They can be summarized as
follows: (i) to improve road maintenance; (ii) to improve road access to the
port of Monrovia; (iii) to upgrade key primary roads and extend the secondary
road system to centers of agricultural development activities; (iv) to provide
most urgent feeder roads to support rural development; (v) to increase port
capacity in Monrovia and Greenville; and (vi) to modernize the international
airport in Monrovia. More recently, the Government has also put emphasis on
improving road links with neighboring Sierra Leone, under the auspices of the
Mano River Union.
18.       Under the Plan, total investments in the transport sector for
1976-80 amount to about US$150 million, or 36 percent of all investments.
Foreign sources are expected to contribute about US$110 million and the
Government, about US$40 million. Most of the investment in the sector, about
US$138 million or 92 percent, is devoted to improvement of the neglected road
network. About 120 miles of road construction was underway or completed in
1977. The plan also incorporates the Government's Five-Year Road Maintenance
and Development Program (1973-77), developed with Bank assistance and esti-
mated to cost about US$12 million. This is being implemented with financial
assistance from the Bank, the African Development Bank, USAID and the Federal
Republic of Germany. One purpose of the proposed project is to provide for
the continuation of this program. The Plan also includes the construction
of about 270 mi of feeder roads over the four-year period (150 mi by the Bank
under the Third Highway Project and the remaining 120 mi financed by USAID).
19.       Port investments are made on a case-by-case basis, and a master plan
for port development is needed. The Plan does not consider the railroad sub-
sector which is outside Government control. Air transport plays a minor role
and its treatment in the Plan seems to be adequate.
20.       The concept of integrated transport planning has only recently
emerged in Liberia. There is evidence of a growing desire in the Govern-
ment to coordinate transport development and to relate it to the overall
development strategy. Formation of a centralized transport planning capac-
ity has been hampered by a shortage of qualified and experienced personnel.



The Government is considering a proposal to strengthen the Bureau of Trans-
portation (BT) in the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Transport (MCIT)
to coordinate all transport: planning and management. With two divisions (one
for Land Transport and Civil Aviation and a new one for Ports and Maritime
Affairs), BT would need to be strengthened by several experts for two to
three years. The Government is presently undertaking a study financed by
UNDP, for which the Bank is the executing agency, to review the legisla-
tive, financial, institutional and manpower implications of strengthening
the Bureau of Transportation.
The Highway Subsector
The Highway Transport System
21.       Liberia's public road network falls far short of the country's needs
both in coverage and quality. There are only 230 miles of asphalt surfaced
roads of which half are in the vicinity of Monrovia and other townships.
Another 1,770 miles are classified as all-weather, but passage over many of
these roads is uncertain in wet weather. Some 42 percent (1,432 miles) of the
public road system consists of dry-weather roads and tracks. There are, in
addition, 1,444 miles of private roads built and maintained by rubber and
timber concessionaires. Some of those roads are available for public use.
There are currently some 21,000 motor vehicles in use in the country of which
about 60 percent are private cars and taxis, 25 percent are commercial vehi-
cles and 15 percent are buses. Over the last 8 years, private car use has
increased; the use of buses and commercial vehicles has fluctuated but not
increased significantly. There are two trends, one for the size of commercial
vehicles to increase, and the other an increase in the numbers of light buses.
22.       Government policy encourages the free development of the road trans-
port industry. Regulations govern only vehicle licensing, registration and
inspection; t-riffs for intra-city taxi services; and vehicle weights and
dimensions anu axle load limits. Other passenger transport and trucking for
hire are free from regulations governing routes, tariffs, or entry into the
industry. Although the situation in the industry is generally satisfactory
with sufficient competition among carriers, a difficulty derives from the
system of regulations dividing responsibility between MCIT (for vehicle
licensing) and the Ministry of Justice (for remaining regulations) which is
not an optimal solution. The need for a more rational administrative organi-
zation will be discussed with the Government in the course of the proposed
study of the reorganization of transport sector planning and coordination
(see para. 20 above).
Government Organization for Highways
23.       The planning and execution of construction and maintenance of all
classified roads in Liberia is undertaken from MPW headquarters in Monrovia.
MPW has also responsibility for public buildings. The MPW payroll exceeds
4,000 employees and there are some 50 professional engineers and 20 architects
in the Ministry. The senior staff is over burdened with responsibilities



-8-
while the employment of consultants and contractors for major works tends to
reduce the opportunities for junior staff to gain practical experience of
up-to-date road building techniques necessary to fit them for higher respon-
sibilities. The proposed Fourth Highway Project embodies proposals to pro-
vide junior professional staff with more opportunities to gain practical
experience (see para 33 below).
24.       Funding for road maintenance has increased considerably over the
last two years (reaching about US$6 million annually) and is now at a level
which is adequate for routine and periodic maintenance with some to spare
to restore earth and gravel roads to a level at which they can be kept in
good order by routine maintenance. But there are weaknesses in the planning
and control of road maintenance operations. The consultancy to improve road
maintenance, begun under the Second Highway Project, has shown benefits in
improving the execution of road maintenance. In the extension planned as
part of the proposed Fourth Highway Project, the consultants will concentrate
on developing capacity for planning and supervision of road maintenance at
the District level.
25.       The amount of machinery and the workshop facilities for road main-
tenance are now approaching an adequate level and a steady stream of trained
plant operators, mechanics and road foremen are beginning to emerge from
the consultants training scheme and the training school at Camp Mechlin which
has been built up with aid from the Federal Republic of Germany. The numbers
of such trained staff still fall short of the need. The need will increase
still further with the forthcoming feeder road project and other projects for
building and improving rural roads being assisted by external aid agencies. A
possible extension of the training facilities will be considered as a part of
the forthcoming feeder road project.
26.       The Planning and Programming Division (PPD) of the Ministry of
Public Works started operations in 1975.  Its functions include the collec-
tion and analysis of data on roads and road transport, the overall planning of
the development of the road system, liaison with other government departments
on transport policies and on traffic regulations, and individual studies
to determine economic priorities and design standards. The Division, for
instance, has functioned as a focus for interministerial planning for the
forthcoming feeder road project which the Bank has under consideration for
possible financing. Progress of PPD has been reasonably good. A transport
economist and two scholarships were provided under the Third Highway Project,
and increased assistance is included in the proposed project to help MPW to
develop its capacity for highway planning.
Highway Standards
27.       The MPW does not have its own model specifications and standards
for highway design, layout and construction. They rely heavily on US model
specifications, and on each major road scheme designs are evolved based
largely on US specifications modified by the consultants' experience. The
rolling terrain of the country means that heavy earthworks may be neces-
sary to provide alignments suitable for travelling speeds of 60 miles/hour.



The extra cost of such earthworks must be balanced against savings in road
user costs, mainly in journey times and possibly in improved safety. It is
necessary therefore to establish appropriate design speeds and associated
geometric standards for each particular scheme; this is being done as part of
the Third Highway Project.
The Construction Industry
28.       Several international contractors maintain offices in Liberia and
there is a lively interest in the prospects for major highway construction.
The domestic road construction industry is represented by two small firms
both currently engaged in USAID highway projects. Whilst these firms have
a reasonable engineering competence, they are encountering difficulties in
developing a capability in estimating, work planning, and financial control.
With an expanding feeder road construction program, there is both the need and
the opportunity to encourage the development of a viable domestic road con-
tracting industry. Capital funds to assist the domestic contracting industry
are available under the Bank loan to the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (Loan 1323-LBR) and technical assistance is being considered as a
possible component for inclusion under the proposed feeder road project.
Past Bank Assistance
29.       The Bank has financed three road projects for Liberia.  The First
Highway Project (US$4.25 million, 1964, Loan 368-LBR) consisted of reconstruc-
ting two roads and supplying equipment for road maintenance. One road, Kle-
Pujehun (44 mi) is in fair condition with increasing amounts of maintenance
required. The other, Paynesville-Robertsfield (28 mi) was completed in
mid-1969 but pavement failures rapidly became evident and the road has needed
continuous repair to keep it in adequate condition to carry the increasing
traffic. These failures derived from a weakening of the road base by the
entry of surface water. This experience - a frequent one in the early days
of bituminous road construction in all African countries - has provided a
useful lesson on the care needed in selecting materials and in supervising the
construction of such roads. The Second Highway Project (US$5.6 million, 1973,
Loan 907/Credit 395-LBR) included technical assistance to improve road main-
tenance and to review the domestic construction industry and the detailed
engineering for U.N. Drive (5.4 mi) in Monrovia, the Totota-Ganta road (83
mi), the Paynesville-Robertsfield (28 mi) and Paynesville-Totota (71 mi) road.
The project also included the construction of the Monrovia bypass. All the
project components have been satisfactorily completed with a small cost
overrun. The Third Highway Project (US$27.5 million, 1975, Loan 1156-LBR)
began in August 1975 and is scheduled for completion at the end of 1979.
Under this project, UN Drive in Monrovia and the Totota-Ganta road are being
reconstructed and the Mesurado River bridge is being constructed in Monrovia.
The project also provides technical assistance for the Planning and Program-
ming Division of MPW and consultant services for feasibility studies on
extension of the main road system from Ganta to Sanniquellie and Tapeta (90
mi) and a study of urban development in Monrovia. Also, a feeder road unit
financed under the project is operating in Lofa County in support of the
Bank-financed agricultural development project, which is being implemented
successfully.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project was identified by the Government and the Bank.
Engineering studies for the construction work proposed under the project were
undertaken by consultants Davies (Sierra Leone) financed under the Second
Highway Project (Loan 907/Credit 395-LBR). The Government requested Bank
Group assistance in financing the proposed project, which was appraised in
June/July 1977. A report entitled, "Liberia: Fourth Highway Project," No.
1827-LBR dated May 4, 1978, is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations took place in Washington April 19-24, 1978. The
Liberian negotiating team was led by Mrs. E. Johnson-Sirleaf, Deputy Minister,
Fiscal and Banking Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
Project Objectives
31.       There are three principal objectives in the proposed Fourth Highway
Project:
(a) to continue to develop the main highway system of Liberia;
(b) to continue to develop local capacity to plan and execute
highway maintenance with increasing emphasis on management;
and
(c) to improve capacity of the Government for highway planning.
Project Description
32.       The project contains the following components:
(a) Reconstruction and improvement of the Paynesville-
Totota road (71 mi) and the Paynesville-Robertsfield
road (28 mi);
(b) Detailed engineering of the Ganta-Sanniquellie road (25 mi)
and the Ganta-Tapeta road (65 mi);
(c)  Feasibility study of the Gbarnga-Voinjama-Kolahun road
(152 mi);
(d) Consultancy services for the planning and execution of road
maintenance;
(e) Technical assistance in highway planning to the Planning
and Programming Division of MPW.

Construction                                                     -
33.       The Paynesville-Totota road forms the first link of the main road
from Monrovia traversing the country and connecting to the agricultural devel-
opment areas in the north. The road was originally constructed in the early
1960s. There are some sections on which the pavement has failed and where
reconstruction of the pavement will be necessary. But, over most of the
length, pavement damage is as yet not widespread. Over these lengths, the
existing pavement will be strengthened so that it continues to give good ser-
vice for many years. A deflection survey proposed by the Bank was carried
out between December 1977 and February 1978 to provide the evidence neces-
sary to determine which sections need complete reconstruction and to plan a
strengthening program for the remainder. There is as yet little experience in
Liberia in the techniques of maintaining and strengthening asphalt surfaced
roads. This component of the project provides the opportunity to introduce
these techniques. The wcrk is to be done by contract and arrangements are
to be made for Liberian engineers to be employed by the contractor so that
they may acquire experience of using these techniques (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.03).
34.       The Paynesville-Robertsfield road connects Monrovia with the main
international airport at Robertsfield and the area beyond Robertsfield.
Faults in initial construction have required continuous efforts to keep the
road in serviceable condition (see para 29 above). The deflection survey
has shown that some 70% of the pavement will have to be reconstructed and
the remainder can be restored by local repairs and strengthening.
Detailed Engineering
35.       Detailed engineering of the Ganta-Sanniquellie road and the Ganta-
Tapeta road is conditional on the results of feasibility studies now in
progress as part of the Third Highway Project (Loan 1156-LBR). Accordingly,
a condition of disbursement of the proposed loan proceeds with respect to
this component would be that the results of the feasibility studies have been
reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
para 4).
Feasibility Study
36.       The project includes a feasibility study for the.improvement of the
Gbarnga-Voinjama-Kolahun road (152 miles). This main road connects the devel-
oping areas of Lofa Count'y with the main road from Ganta to Monrovia. The
feasibility study will be carried out in two stages - a-prefeasibility study
to indicate the likely g,rowth of traffic and preliminary cost estimate, fol-
lowed by detailed feasibility studies on selected road sections to indicate
appropriate standards andl timing for improvement.

Road Maintenance
37.       The consultants services for road maintenance constitute an exten-
sion of the consultancy financed in the Second Highway Project (Loan 907/
Credit 395-LBR). Good progress has been made during the initial consultancy
in the physical operations of maintaining earth and gravel roads. But it
has proved difficult to introduce improved methods of planning and organizing
road maintenance particularly at local level. The extension of the consul-
tancy incorporates revised terms of reference which require the consultant
to establish teams at three regional centers in order that they can have
a greater impact of the management of road maintenance at local level. The
project provides a total of about 35 man-years of consultancy services for
road maintenance. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government would
continue to allocate funds in the 1980-82 budgets adequate to meet the costs
of routine and periodic maintenance of roads as required under its annual
road maintenance programs and that it would review annually with the Bank the
progress in carrying out the road maintenance programs (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.05).
Technical Assistance
38.       Transport planning in Liberia has been limited so far to  responses
on an ad hoc basis to immediate and obvious transport needs. As the country
moves into a phase of planned economic development the need is becoming appa-
rent to plan the development of the transport system so that it keeps pace with
development of other sectors. The need for more effective planning appeared
first in the MPW and the proposed project makes provision for extending the
technical aid to the Planning and Programming Division of MPW started under
the Third Highway Project by a further 4 man-years.
Project Cost and Financing
39.       Total project costs are estimated to be US$28.8 million net of taxes
and include 10% physical contingency and price contingencies varying from 7 to
9% per annum. Foreign costs are estimated to be US$21.2 million (74% of the
total). The proposed Bank loan of US$13.8 million would finance the foreign
costs of the reconstruction and improvement the Paynesville-Totota Road, the
consultancy services for road maintenance, the detailed engineering study,
feasibility study and technical assistance. The remaining foreign costs of
US$7.4 million will be provided as parallel financing by the Kuwait Fund for
the reconstruction and improvement of the Paynesville-Robertsfield road. The
Government would finance the local cost of the project, estimated at US$7.6
million.  In order to ensure continuity in consulting services for road main-
tenance, it was agreed to provide retroactive financing of up to US$200,000
incurred after July 1, 1978 for road maintenance consulting services.



- 13 -
Implementation
40.       The Ministry of Public Works will have responsibility for project
execution. Project execution is expected to start in July 1978 and to be
completed by July 1982. Construction works on both Paynesville-Totota and
Paynesville-Robertsfield roads will be supervised by an international con-
sulting firm, Davies, which was responsible for the detailed engineering.
Procurement
41.       Contractors for the reconstruction and improvement of the
Paynesville-Totota road would be prequalified and the contract would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. The employment of consultants provided under the project
would be in accordance with normal Bank procedures. The average cost of
consultants is estimated at T7sno,500 per man-inuntlh. The contract for the
reconstruction and improvement of the Paynesville-Robertsfield road would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Kuwait Fund.
Disbursements
42.       Disbursements will be distributed as follows:  (a) 72% of the cost
of the civil works on the Playnesville-Totota road, totalling US$7.73 million;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditure on consultant services for supervision of the
civil works under (a) above, totalling US$0.7 million; (c) 100% of foreign
expenditure on detailed engineering of the Ganta-Sanniquellie and Ganta-
Tappeta roads, totalling US$0.38 million; (d) 100% of foreign expenditure on
feasibility study on the Gharnga-Voinjama-Kolahun road, totalling US$0.47
million; (e) 100% of foreign expenditure on consultancy services for the road
maintenance program, totalling US$2.4 million; (f) 100% of foreign expenditure
for the technical assistance to MPW totalling US$0.23 million. An unallocated
amount of US$1.89 million has been provided.
Economic Evaluation and Benefits
43.       The proposed project represents a balance between capital invest-
ment aimed at direct improvement of the transport infrastructure and technical
assistance aimed at improving the proficiency of local institutions related
to the transport sector. The economic justification for the Paynesville-
Totota road is based on savings in avoiding reconstruction costs, in vehicle
operating costs and in road maintenance; for the Paynesville-Robertsfield
road, the justification is based on savings in vehicle operating costs and
road maintenance. The economic rate of return is estimated to be 20% for the
Paynesville-Totota road, the cost of which is about US$11.5 million; and 22%
for the Paynesville-Robertsfield road, the cost of which is about US$8.4
million. The weighted average economic rate of return on these components,
which account for 82% of total project costs, is 21%.   The sensitivity
analysis shows that the returns remain well above 10-12%, the estimated
opportunity cost of capita:L in Liberia, even if costs increase by 20% or
benefits decrease by 20%.



- 14 -
44.       Paynesville-Totota is a section of the Monrovia-Ganta road, the
backbone of the country's road network. The remaining section of this road
from Totota to Ganta is being reconstructed under the Third Highway Project.
This road provides the link from Monrovia, the capital city and principal
port, to regions in the northwest and southeast; it also connects with the
Ganta-Harper road in the east and is the only direct route to Guinea and Ivory
Coast. The main traffic-generating activities in the areas directly served by
the road through feeder roads are cash crop cultivation, rubber production and
exploitation of timber resources. The project road traverses two populated
counties (Montserrado and Bong) with increasing agricultural activity. There
are about 90,000 acres cultivated in the hinterland of Paynesville-Totota roaa.
Major crops are rice, 17,000 t; cassava 10,000 t; and sugar cane 14,000 t.
45.       The Paynesville-Robertsfield road is an important stretch of the
only coastal road providing the link between Monrovia and Buchanan, an impor-
tant port and the second largest town in the country. The road also connects
the country's main international airport with the capital. The main traffic-
generating activities in the road zone are rubber plantations and the airport
traffic. There are about 80,000 acres cultivated in the hinterland of
Paynesville-Robertsfield road. The major crop is rubber, about 36,000 t/p.a.
In addition, some 10,000 t of sugar cane and about 5,000 t of cassava and rice
each are produced annually in the road vicinity. The production volume of
other crops is marginal.
46.       It is expected that, in the first round of distribution, the major
beneficiaries of transport cost reductions will be the local truck owners
and operators. The cost reductions will later be passed on to the farmers
in the zone of road influence in the form of higher farmgate prices due to
lower transport costs or slower increases in transport costs because of the
competitive situation in the road transport industry. Consumers are also
expected to benefit directly from reduced vehicle operating costs. Some
benefits are expected to be passed on to passengers since there is competition
in inter-urban passenger transport. The project is also expected to produce
general benefits to other sectors, such as promoting an increase in agricul-
tural production (in the roads' zone) and to the economy as a whole by
improving part of the most important main road in the country. It is not
feasible, however, to estimate quantitatively how the project benefits would
diffuse to the Government, among the population and to different economic
sectors.
47.       The other elements of the project (consulting services for road main-
tenance and technical assistance to MPW) were not included in the calculation
of the economic rate of return. They are mostly an extension of technical
assistance: (i) in the maintenance program of the Second Highway Project
which has a 30% rate of return and (ii) in the Planning and Programming
Division (MPW) which is geared to strengthen the Government organization in
the transport sector, increase its efficiency and enable it to prepare future
projects.

Risks
48.       There are no major risks which may jeopardize the implementation
of the project or the achievement of its objectives.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Liberia and the
Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of.Agreement, are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
50.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III of this Report. A special condition of effectiveness of the Loan
Agreement would be that the Government and the Kuwait Fund have signed a loan
agreement with respect to the reconstruction of the Paynesville-Robertsfield
road. A condition of disBursement with respect to the detailed engineering
work would be that the feasibility studies have been reviewed and found
satisfactory by the Bank.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement: of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 305-LBR        First Education Project:  US$7.2 Million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Effective Date: December 18, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
After initial delays in awarding civil works contracts, project
implementation has progressed on schedule, and most of the project facilities
are in operation. The education, manpower, and university planning components
have been completed satisfactorily. The credit closing date has been extended
to December 31, 1979 to allow for full disbursement of technical assistance
funds. There will be a small cost overrun that will be met by Government.
Project management has been good.
Loan No. 1266T-LBR        Second Education Project:  US$4.0 Million Third
Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effective Date:
July 8, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1980
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Most of the
project technical assistance personnel are in post and candidates for fellow-
ships have been identified. Equipment lists are being prepared and furniture
and vehicles are being purchased. Construction of 29 of the 100 community
school units is underway. There has been some delay in construction due
to shortages of materials and an unusually long rainy season but the project
is expected to be completed on schedule and within the appraisal estimates.
Implementation has benefited from good project management.
Loan No. 1417-LBR         Third Education Project:  US$6.3 Million Loan of
May 26, 1977; Effective Date: July 13, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Division of Educational Facilities has been established and has
been doing design work on project and non-project schools. Designs for the
science and technology centers and Forestry Training Institute have recently
been completed, about six months behind schedule due to site acquisition
delays. Institutional aspects of project implementation, such as identifica-
tion of fellowship candidates and plans for operation of the vocational
training center, are proceseding satisfactorily. Project management has been
good.

Credit No. 306-LBR        Agricultural Development and Technical Assistance
Project: US$1.2 million Credit of May 17, 1972;
Effective Date: December 8, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
Implementation of the project suffered during the early stages
due to financial, administrative and managerial problems but the situation
gradually improved and all project objectives, except for the Pilot Rubber
Scheme, were achieved. The replanted acreage under the Pilot Rubber Scheme
is about 35 percent below appraisal estimates but the Scheme will be incor-
porated into the Rubber Development Project. The rice research program has
made good progress and will be continued under the Bong County Agricultural
Development Project.
Credit No. 577-LBR        Agricultural Development (Lofa) Project:  US$6
million Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective Date:
May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is in its second year of implementation (the Credit
became effective in May 1976, but key technical and managerial staff did not
reach full strength until September-October 1976) and progress to date has
been satisfactory. During the first cropping season, 75 ha of swamp rice,
76 ha of upland rice, 110 ha of coffee and 35 ha of cocoa will be developed.
Project proposals for feeder road improvement, training of extension staff and
farmers, input and credit supply, development of rural banking services and
schistosomiasis surveillance are being implemented satisfactorily. Disburse-
ment of IDA credit is behind schedule primarily because of late start of the
project but expected to accelerate as project activities gather momentum.
Government of Liberia has kept the project adequately funded and has given the
required support. There has been a positive response from the project farmers.
Credit No. 700-LBR        Agricultural Development (Bong) Project:  US$7
million Credit of December 29, 1977; Effective Date:
March 15, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Signing of the credit was delayed by several months due to staffing
problems. Most of key project positions have now been filled and the project
implementation has begun. Project startup activities (e.g. construction of
office buildings and staff houses, staff recruitment) have been financed with
funds provided from the project preparation facility.
Loan No. 1544-LBR         Rubber Development Project:  US$7 million Loan and
Credit No. 786-LBR        US$6 million Credit, both of April 21, 1978:  Not
Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Project start up activities (e.g. staff training, nursery prepara-
tion, acquisition of land, building plan) financed by the Government are
making good progress and the project implementation is expected to commence
on schedule. The project manager is in post and the financial controller has
been appointed.

C3losing Date: June 30, 1978;
Credit No. 395-LBR         IJS$2.6 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective
JDate: December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30,
-1978
The design and -reconstruction of the Monrovia By-Pass has been com-
pleted with a small cost overrun. The feasibility studies of the improvement
of three roads in the vicinity of Monrovia are now completed; on two of the
roads which are important links in the main highway network, reconstruction
has been demonstrated as amply justified. Technical assistance in the Govern-
ment's four-year maintenance program is already showing benefits in improved
running surfaces on earth and gravel roads and plans are now being made to
consolidate the gains and develop them still further by closer attention to
the organization and planning of road maintenance. A study to determine how
best to improve the efficiency of the local civil engineering construction
industry has been completed.
Loan No. 1156-LBR          Third Highway Project:  US$27.5 Million Loan of
A.ugust 28, 1975; Effective Date: October 14, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The construction of a major bridge and of an urban main road (5.4
mi.) in Monrovia and of a rural main road (83 mi.) has started and is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily although initially somewhat hampered by bad weather
and difficulties in the supply of materials. The feasibility studies of
rural main roads and for an urban transport study in Monrovia are making
good progress. A feeder road construction unit became operational in January
1977 and is operating successfully. Technical assistance in building up the
planning department of the Ministry of Public Works is proving fairly effec-
tive.
Loan No. 1055-LBR          Second Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$4 Million Loan of December 3, 1974; Effective Date:
January 3, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979; and
Loan No. 1323-LBR          Third Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$7 Million Loan of October 7, 1976; Effective
Date:  December 17, 1976; Closing Date:  December 31,
1981
The Loan 1055-LBR helped LBDI meet its financial requirements
through calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals during calendar 1976
surpassed the projected level for the year. Commitments and disbursements
were similarly above targets. Disbursement of Bank funds, in particular,
has been faster than projlected. The loan is fully committed and 80% dis-
bursed as of October 31, 1977. The Loan 1323-LBR, signed October 7, 1976,
together with a loan from the African Development Bank, would cover LBDI's
foreign resource gap for the period 1977 and 1979.

Loan No. 1150-LBR         Third Power Project:  US$1.8 Million Loan of
August 1, 1975; Effective Date: October 20, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project finances technical assistance for establishing a long-
range development plan and detailed investment program as well as for strength-
ening the management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) and train-
ing its staff. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily, although
the training program needs to be expanded to include practical training for
middle-level staff. The financial performance of the utility has deteriorated
and remedial measures are being taken to improve LEC's financial viability,
e.g. tariff increases, improved financial controls, in connection with the
proposed fourth power project. The Board of Directors recently replaced the
Managing Director with another Liberian. LEC is actively seeking assistance
from a foreign electric power utility to provide a management support team to
replace expatriates who are leaving on the expiry of their contracts.
