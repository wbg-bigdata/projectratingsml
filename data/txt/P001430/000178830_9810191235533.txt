PROPOSED FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Introduction and Summary
(Sector and Project Sections of President's Report)
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Geographic and Economic Factors Influencing Transport
1.01      Liberia with an area of 43,000 square miles consists of a narrow
coastal plain with extensive swamps, tidal lagoons and creeks; a central
area of plateaux and narrow valleys containing the high rain forest; and of
a mountainous area along the Guinea border. These geographical features do
not constitute a major obstacle to transport development, except possibly
along the coastal belt. The population of 1.5 million is unevenly distributed
with well over 60% occupying 30% of the land area in the central and southwest
regions of the country. Monrovia, the capital and commercial center, alone
has about 15% of the population.
1.02      The country is rich in natural resources, notably in iron ore,
timber and rubber. Despite the potential, economic development has been
very modest and the development of the transport infrastructure has been
largely associated with the enclave-based economy. Over the period 1967-74
the average growth of the economy was 5% in real terms but slowed to only
about 1% per year in 1974-76. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in-
creased over 1960-1975 at about 2% p.a. reaching some US$450 in 1976 which is
high compared to most African countries. The share of transport sector in GDP
is relatively high (mainly due to ship registration fees), 1/ reaching about
8% in current prices; the growth of the transport sector was about 7% in real
terms during 1971-74. The country's economy has been and is still essentially
based on foreign enclaves -- iron ore mines, forestry concessions and rubber
plantations -- which contribute about 40% of GDP. Apart from possible iron
ore concessions under study, the principal export potential still to be
developed is timber. Potential production in the forest area bounded by
Zwedru, Greenville and Port Harper is about 800,000 tons per year. Infra-
structure development will be needed to exploit these resources. The rest
of the economy predominantly comprises traditional agriculture, mainly rice,
cassava, palm products and sugar cane; the traditional economy contributes
about 14% of GDP.
1/   It costs US$1.20 a ton to register a ship in Liberia for the first
time and 10 cents a ton annually thereafter.



-2-
B. The Transport System
1.03      The transport infrastructure consists of about 4,900 miles of
roads, three privately-owned railways totalling about 300 miles, four sea-
ports and 14 airfields served by scheduled flights. The system reflects the
enclave-based economy for which it has been developed. However, it will
require major investments for its improvement and modernization, following
new development targets (set in the 1976-1980 Plan) which include a more
diversified agriculture-based economy. Unlike most other West African coun-
tries, even the trunk road network is not yet established.
1.04      Major transport flows (Page 3) reflect the country's current eco-
nomic activity. Railroads carry some 20-25 million tons of iron ore annually
to the ports of Monrovia and Buchanan. More than half of all road transport,
the predominant mode for passengers and goods other than iron ore, is concen-
trated in the Monrovia region and along the Monrovia-Ganta axis, the location
of most of the rubber plantations. Internal air transport is negligible.
Commercial coastal shipping does not exist even though it could provide a
link between Monrovia and the southern part of the country, which is poorly
served by roads.
(a) Highways
1.05      Details of the highway sub-sector are discussed in Chapter 2.
(b) Railways
1.06      The railway network, owned and operated by four mining concessions,
consists of (i) the Monrovia-Bomi Hills Mine-Mano River line (90 mi), (ii)
the Monrovia-Bong Mine line (48 mi) and (iii) the LAMCO line (166 mi). Except
for the LAMCO line, the railways are used exclusively for transporting iron
ore from the mines to the ports. This traffic increased from about 12 million
tons in 1964 to about 20 million tons in 1975. In addition to other mine-
related traffic which all the railways carry, the LAMCO line carries some
100,000 tons of general cargo annually including about 10,000 tons of rubber
and 6,000 tons of logs and sawn timber for other concessions as well as about
150 passengers daily.
1.07      The future development of the railway network will, as in the past,
be linked with expansion of the mining sector and a number of projects are
under study. Two needs will be (i) the construction of a new railway line or
alternatively of a pipeline from the Wologisi range in the northeast to con-
nect to a coastal port to carry some 10 million tons of iron ore annually and
(ii) the extension of the LAMCO line into Guinea to transport by 1982 up to
15 million tons per year of Guinea's iron ore to the Buchanan port. A study
is already underway to investigate the additional railway and port facilities
necessary.



-3-
(c) Ports
1.08      Liberia has four seaports:  M3nrovia and Buchanan which ale deep-
water ports and handle over 90% of foreign trade, and Greenville anal Harper,
which are shallow-water ports and handla mainly log exports. A sumnLary de-
scription of the recent port traffic is given in the table below.  Port
traffic increased from 16.1 million tons in 1965 to about 27.0 million tons
in 1973, a growth of about 7% p.a; the najor growth occurred in iron ore.
Since 1974 general cargo and transshipment traffic has been declining due
partly to restrictive import regulations and partly to the world economic
recession which has lowered demand for iron ore.

1.09      The National Port Authority (NPA) administers three ports; the opera-
tions of the fourth port, Buchanan, are directed by LAMCO. NPA operations are
fairLy efficient, although stronger planning and coordination and additional
professional personnel are needed. Its operations are profitable, making an
annual profit of US$1-2 million.

1.10      Capacity is adequate at all the ports, but mining and forestry
developments will call for expansion of facilities or even some new p,ort
development. On the basis of consultant forecasts of general cargo traffic,
the 2lonrovia port would require additional general cargo quay length and more
warehousing space by the early 1980's. The channel needs dredging to increase
the safety of existing ore carrier operations and possibly to accept 150,000 -
ton vessels in the future.  A contract has been signed for a consulting team
to study the modernization and expansion of Monrovia port. The stucy is
financed by NPA and should be completed in 1979. The future needs of the
Buchanan port will be determined by decisions on transporting Guinea's iron
ore on the LAMCO line.  The capacity of the Greenville port is being increased
by about 150,000 tons under a loan from the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG),
and the Harper port is expected to be studied under prospective aid from the
European Economic Community. Potential timber exports from the hinterland of
up to 800,000 tons per year and possible mining operations imply a need both
to expand the capacity of the ports and to improve communications between the
ports and the interior.
(d) Air Transport
1.11      Liberia has two international airports:  one at Robertsfield almost
midway between Monrovia and Buchanan, and the other at Spriggs Payne near
Monrovia. There are also numerous airfields of which 12 are served by sched-
uled flights. International passenger traffic has increased at a high rate
of 8% p.a. since 1971, reaching about 83,000 in 1976. A similar percentage
increase has been registered over the same period in air cargo to and from
Liberia. An airport improvement program started in 1971 with funds from USAID
to reinforce and extend to 11,000 feet the runway at Robertsfield, construct
a new control tower, and to install an instrument landing system. A new
terminal building was completed and put into use in February 1978 and the
runway shoulders are being widened to accommodate Boeing 707s. The 4,800 foot
runway at Spriggs Payne was recently extended to accommodate aircraft up to
DC-8 size.
1.12      Domest:ic air transport, handled by the Government-owned Air Liberia
(AL) and two non-scheduled charter companies, has been declining over the past
six years. AL is most affected; it is inefficient and its losses increased
from US$0.6 million in 1974 to about US$1.0 million in 1976. Since 1976 it
has been managed by British Caledonian Airways. Domestic service has an
important role in transport to remote parts of the country not yet served
by all-weather roads.  AL has sufficient capacity to meet Liberia's needs for
the time being.
C.   Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
(a) Investment Policy
1.13      The Government's objectives for the transport sector are presented
in the First Development Plan 1976-1980. They can be summarized as follows:
(i) to improve road maintenance; (ii) to improve road access to the port of
Monrovia; (iii) to upgrade key primary roads and extend the seconidary road



- 5 -
system to centers of agricultural development activities; (iv) to provide
most urgent feeder roads to support rural development; (v) to increase port
capacity in Monrovia and Greenville; and (vi) to modernize the international
airport in Monrovia. More recently the Government has also put emphasis on
improving road links with neighboring Sierra Leone, under the auspices of the
Mano River Union, and increasing the capacity of the LAMCO railway and the
Buchanan port to accomodate Guinea's iron ore exports.
1.14      Under the Plan total investments in the transport sector for 1976-80
amount to about US$153 million or 42% of all investments. 1/ The table on
page 6 shows that foreign sources are expected to contribute about US$110
million and the Government, about US$43 million. The program might be
too ambitious. Some of the projects do not have external financing secured,
and furthermore it is uncertain that the Government could provide the funding
for its share. Some of the road projects, as well as the extension of Green-
ville port, have questionable priority. In general, the list of transport
projects does not seem to be based on a comprehensive analysis of demand in
other economic sectors or on established development policy. Nevertheless,
the Plan marks a new, positive development by bringing a more organized
mid-term approach.
1.15      Most of the investment in the sector, about US$141 million or 92%,
is devoted to improvement of the neglected road network (para 1.03). About
120 miles of road construction projects are underway or were completed in
1976. If the Plan materializes on time, which does not appear likely, about
325 mi will be improved to paved standard and an additional 355 mi to gravel
standard by 1980. The Plan also incorporates the Government's Five-Year Road
Maintenance and Development Program (1973-77), estimated to cost about US$12
million. This is being implemented with financial assistance from the Bank,
the African Development Bank, USAID and FRG. One purpose of the proposed
project is to provide for the continuation of this program. The Plan also
includes feeder roads, and construction of about 270 mi is planned for the
four-year period (150 mi by the Bank under the Third Highway Project and the
remaining 120 mi by USAID).
1.16      Port investments are made on a case-by-case basis, and a master plan
for port development is needed. The Plan does not consider the railroad sub-
sector which is outside Government control. Air transport plays a minor role;
its treatment in the Plan seems to be adequate.
(b) Transport Planning and Coordination
1.17      The concept of integrated development planning has only recently
emerged in Liberia. There is evidence of a growing desire in the Govern-
ment to coordinate transport development and to relate it to the overall
development strategy.  Formation of a centralized transport planning capac-
ity has been hampered by a shortage of qualified and experienced personnel.
1/   This compares with total investments of US$27 million for 1972-1975,
or about 25-30% of all public investments in the period. (See table on
page 6.)

1.18      The Government is considering a Bank proposal to strengthen the
Bureau of Transportation (BT) in the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and
Transport (MCIT) to coordinate all transport planning and management. BT
already has two divisions, one handling land transport and the other handling
civil aviation. Some reorganization and increase in staff will be required
for the Bureau to assume wider responsibilities in the transport sector.
Technical assistance will be needed for at least two years to establish the
reorganized BT as an effective unit for transport planning and coordination.
The Government has agreed to engage a transport specialist to prepare a
position paper. The specialist will be financed by UNDP and work on the basis
of Terms of Reference (Annex 3) agreed upon with the Government.

II. THE HIIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
2.01      Liberia's public road network falls short of the country's needs
both in coverage and quality. There are only 230 miles of asphalt surfaced
roads of which half are in the vicinity of Monrovia and other townships.
Another 1,770 miles are classified as having all-weather surfacing, but
passage over many parts of these roads is uncertain in wet weather. The
remaining 1,432 miles of the public road system consists of dry-weather roads
and tracks. As shown below there are, in addition, 1,444 miles of private
roads built and maintained by rubber and timber concessionaires, some of which
are available for public use.

The classification of roads in Liberia recognizes three types of road --
primary, secondary and rural. The distinction between roads classified as
primary and secondary is not always clear and Liberia needs a more sophi-
sticated, functional classification of roads, distinguishing between roads
with national, regional or purely local functions. In this report, the terms
"main road," "secondary road," and "feeder road" are used to make this dis-
tinction.
2.02      The layout of the main and secondary road system is shown in the
Map. In essence it consists of:
(a) a main road running northeast from Monrovia bisecting the
country and travelling through Sanniquellie to the common
border point with Guinea and Ivory Coast, and with two
tributory main roads one extending to Lofa County in the
north and the other extending southeast through Nimba
County and Grand Gedeh County to reach the coast at
Greenville and Harper;
(b) a network extending northwest from Monrovia to the border
with Sierra Leone; and
(c) a coastal road southeast from Monrovia past the inter-
national airport at Robertsfield to Buchanan.
The Government intends to build a gravel road from Bopolo through Bella Yella
to Kolahun with assistance from USAID. Although this road is being designed
to quite a low standard (20 ft. carriageway, gravel surface), it is likely
that it will rapidly become an important traffic artery between Monrovia
and the north of the country.
2.03      The general form of the main road system north of the Monrovia-
Sanniquellie road is clear. An immediate objective is to provide access to
the prospering agricultural areas in the north of Lofa county; a longer term
objective is to open up for development the more thinly populated areas in
the center of the region. In this part of the country, priorities in road
buildling are:
(a) to upgrade the main road system to a standard adequate for
the expected traffic, and
(b) to develop the subsidiary road system to serve development
needs, distinguishing as soon as practicable between routes
which will function as secondary roads and roads which have
only a local function.
2.04       In the southeastern half of the country the lines for development
of the highway system are less obvious. The present trend, following existing
roads and tracks, is to develop the road connection from Monrovia to Harper
and other southern townships in a huge semicircle which travels northeast



- 10 -
almost to the border with Guinea before turning southward to link with the
south. A southern coastal highway has been considered to link Harper and the
southern coastal region more directly with the capital. As this region is
developed, there will clearly be a need for such a road, but it is not obvious
what route this road should follow or when it should be built. Decisions on
the development of the highway system of the southeastern region of Liberia
depend, first, on the potential for development in the interior of Grand Bassa,
Grand Gedeh, Sino and Maryland counties, second on Government decisions on
the form and location of such development, and finally on the production of a
transport plan for the region which considers not only highways but also the
possibilities of coastal shipping and of further development of port facili-
ties along the southern coast.
B.   Traffic and Road Transport Industry
2.05      An indication of the growth and composition of the vehicle fleet is
provided by the only data available on vehicle registrations and is summarized
below:

Commerce, Industry and Transportation, July 1977.
In the decade up to 1970 vehicle registrations had been increasing at 11% per
annum, but vehicles going out of use were not automatically deregistered. A
start was made in 1970 to remove from the register vehicles no longer in use.
The effects of this change explain much of the inconsistency in the table.
Taking into account the data on fuel consumption given below, it seems likely
that over the last eight years private car use has increased slowly, while the
use of trucks and buses has fluctuated but not increased to any marked degree.
Therefore, it seems likely that the fleet in use is somewhat smaller than
presented in the table. Recent trends are for larger trucks to replace small
ones and for a rapid increase in mini-buses. Most of these latter are regis-
tered in the Monirovia area. As yet about 50% of passenger transport is
concentrated in and around Monrovia.

2.06      The last comprehensive counts on the network were made in 1971.
With technical assistance provided under the Second and Third Highway Proj-
ects, more systematic traffic counts on the primary system were introduced
in 1976. Data available so far indicate that about 200 miles of roads carry
over 500 vehicles per day (vpd) and about 800 miles carry more than 100 vpd.
The most heavily trafficked road is the Monrovia-Totota-Ganta road which
carries about 4,000 vpd near the capital and some 300 vpd near Ganta. Based
on an analysis of general economic trends, fuel consumption and vehicle fleet
development, an overall traffic growth rate of about 5% p.a. is forecast for
1977-81.
2.07      Government policy encourages the free development of the road
transport industry. Regulations govern only vehicle licensing, registration
and inspection; tariffs for intra-city taxi services; and vehicle dimensions
and axle load limits. Other passenger transport and "for hire" trucking are
free from regulations governing routes, tariffs, or entry into the industry.
Although the situation in the industry is generally satisfactory with suf-
ficient competition among carriers, the difficulty derives from the system of
regulations dividing responsibility between MCIT (for vehicle licensing) and
the Ministry of Justice (for remaining regulations) which is not an optimal
solution. More generally there is a lack of reliable data on the numbers
and types of road vehicles in regular use, on traffic flows on the different
classes of road, on the movements of people and goods by road and no vehicle
loadings. Road accidents are said to be increasing at an alarming rate but
there is no data on their frequency, location and attributed causes. Such
information is necessary as a basis for transport planning. Responsibility
for obtaining this data and for other functions of a road traffic authority
will be considered as part of the proposed review of the reorganization of
transport sector planning and coordination (para. 1.18).
2.08      Increasing congestion is hampering the movement of people and goods
in Monrovia. Some relief will be provided by the reconstruction of UN Drive
and by the building of a new Mensurado bridge under the Third Highway Project.
But traffic control is minimal, indiscriminate parking is condoned, and
minibuses, though proving a popular and effective means of transport, operate



- 12 -
without control over their franchise and routing. The problems of urban
traffic flow are being considered more comprehensively in the urban development
study which is being undertaken as part of the Third Highway Project.
C.    Administration
2.09         The planning,  design,  construction and maintenance  of  roads  and
public bui4dings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW). The organization of the Ministry is shown below.

Each of the four functions above is undertaken by separate divisions of the
ministry for both roads and public buildings. Coordination of the activities
of the divisions is done at a high level, adding to the heavy work load of
senior staff.   The Planning and Programming Division is a recent  innovation
with technical assistance provided to build up its competence as part of the
Third Highway Project.



- 13 -
D.   Staff and Training
2.10)     MPW has a payroll exceeding 4,000 employees.  There are some 50
professional engineers and 12 architects in the Ministry. Recently, the
Ministry recruited a number of Haitian engineers who are bringing useful
experience into the country. The annual budget of MPW (about US$14 million in
1975) has increased yearly. The average annual expenditure per professional
man does not represent an unduly high work load on each individual. In the
highway field, the senior staff are long in experience but short in knowledge
of up-to-date methods of road construction and maintenance. The more junior
staff have generally a fairly good academic background but they do not have
much opportunity to build up experience in design or construction. Most major
road works are designed and supervised by consultants and undertaken by
foreign contractors. Ministry engineers have little opportunity to gain
practical experience of the advanced techniques of design and construction
used on major road works.
2.11      Under MPW's manpower development program, scholarships are awarded
to engineers for study in the USA and at the University of Liberia. This
program is assisted by the Bank (two transportation economists are studying
in the USA under the Third Highway Project). Although precise estimates are
not yet available, it seem likely that the number of engineers goin$ for
first-degree studies does not fall far short of the likely demand. The main
needs are to provide good, practical experience in planning, design, construc-
tion and management; and for the opportunity to obtain detailed knowledge of
the techniques of highway engineering as is being provided by short post-
graduate courses in many parts of the world. One aim in the proposed Fourth
Highway Project is to provide more opportunities for local engineers to obtain
good practical experience (para. 3.05).
2.12      Although training for sub-professional staff is developing fairly
well, there is still a considerable shortage of trained and experienced
foremen, mechanics, and machinery operators. MPW provides scholarships for
over 50 technicians each year for basic training. In addition, the training
school for mechanics and highway technicians at Camp Mechlin provided under
aid from FRG has been fully operational since mid-1975 and is now producing a
steady stream of trained personnel. Consultants on highway maintenance under
the Second Highway Project are providing on-the-job training for foremen,
plant operators and mechanics. Aid from the FRG for the training school was
scheduled to cease in March 1978, with the intention that the Liberian Govern-
ment take over the financing of the school and direct its work. FRG has
agreed to continue limited aid in the form of expert advisors for one more
year; the Liberian counterpart staff have been rapidly gaining experience both
in technical matters and in administration of the unit.
2.13      These training schemes are available only to government employees.
The Government is considering opening its training facilities to contractors'
staff. As yet, domestic contractors in the highway field are not sufficiently
strong to tempt trainees out of government service.



- 14 -
E.   Highway Planning
2.14      The Planning and Programming Division (PPD) of MPW starteui opera-
tions in 1975. Its functions include the collection and analysis of data on
roads and road transport, the overall planning of the development of the road
system, liaison with other government departments on transport policies and on
traffic regulation, and individual studies to determine economic priorities
and design standards. PPD, for instance, has functioned as a focus for
interministerial planning for a feeder road project scheduled for FY79.
Progress of PPD has been reasonably good. A transport economist and two
scholarships were provided under the Third Highway Project, and increased
assistance is included in the proposed project to help MPW to develop its
capacity for highway planning.
F.   Highway Financing
2.15      Road construction works have been financed largely by foreign lend-
ing with the Bank Group, USAID, FRG and the African Development Bank (AfDB)
as principal sources. Capital investments in highways have been at a low
level, and in the period 1972-1975 only about US$7.5 million was invested in
new road construction (page 6). The Four-Year Development Plan (1976-1980)
gives priority to the development of road transport infrastructure; about
US$141 million (US$36 million to be financed by the Government) was envisaged
for the highways, about 38% of total investments. It has proved difficult to
muster all the resources necessary, and after two years it is evident that the
road component of the plan will not be achieved on time. One difficulty lies
in the current trend of aid donors to favor projects which directly concern
rural developmernt.
2.16      Annual expenditures for all MPW's operations (administration,
technical services, force account construction and road maintenance) are
financed from the general budget, consisting of the recurrent budget and the
development budget. Expenditures for recurrent maintenance increased f rom
US$1.5 million in 1971 to about US$2.6 million in 1975. The funding of
highway maintenance improved substantially in 1976, when the total amount
allocated to recurrent road maintenance reached about US$5.3 million as shown
in the following table:

Now the main limitation arises in organizing and executing rather than funding
road maintenance. For 1977/78 the Ministry of Finance has indicated that
US$6.5 million will be allocated for recurrent maintenance. This sum, if
efficiently dispersed for the purpose intended, should be adequate for current
needs (para. 2.22). During negotiations the Government agreed to continue to
allocate necessary funds for routine and periodic maintenance in the 1980-82
budgets and, at the same time, to improve methods of planning and monitoring
road maintenance expenditure (paras 2.23 and 2.24).
2.17      Over the past five years the revenues from road user charges have
been in the region of US$8 million per year as shown in the following table.
Road maintenance expenditure, including the servicing of loans for equipment
etc., is now rising towards this figure. Fuel taxes at 120/gallon on gasoline
and 100/ gallon on gasoil are low and could be increased without distorting
the traffic patterns of the country. An expanding program of road maintenance
and improvement is in prospect in Liberia; there are therefore good reasons
for suggesting that some of the costs of this expanded road program should
be reflected in increases in road user taxation. The Government is currently
considering such increases.

2.18      All the signs are for a considerable increase in the building of
secondary and feeder roads. The USAID program contains a Rural Road Program
III for which US$5.2 million has so far been allocated. A Bank Feeder Road
Project is proposed for FY 1979. There are other donors seeking to funnel
aid into rural development.
G.   Engineering
2.19      Liberia is generally an easy country for road builders.  Except in
the coastal belt, the terrain is rolling with occasional escarpments which
present some challenge in road location. The soils are mostly sandy latosols
which provide an excellent foundation for roads; there are areas with impeded
drainage, producing swamps which can easily be avoided except in the coastal
belt. Good road-making materials, lateritic gravels, and rock suitable for
quarrying are easily available in most parts of the country.  The rivers flow
almost entirely over bedrock, so -- apart from in the coastal belt -- bridge
foundations present no problems. There is a dearth of hydrological data
so that the estimation of peak stream and river flows does present some
difficulties.
2.20      MPW does not have its own model specifications and standards for
highway geometric design; instead they rely heavily on US specifications.
For each major road project, therefore, geometric designs are evolved based
largely on US specifications modified by consultants and the MPW. The rolling



- 17 -
terrain of the country means that heavy earthworks may be needed to provide
suitable alignments, making it necessary to establish appropriate design
speeds and geometric standards for each project. The extra cost of such
earthworks must be balanced against savings in road user costs, mainly journey
times and improved safety. This is being done under the Third Highway Project
for the hilly area near Sanniquellie. The feasibility studies will derive
design speeds from a comparison of costs and benefits.
2.21      In the absence of model specifications for pavement design and con-
struction, the specifications for individual projects have varied and have
sometimes not proved entirely satisfactory (para. 2.36). MPW should prepare
and issue their own model specifications. Measurement of vehicle and axle
loads undertaken during the surveys in the Sanniquellie area could be used
to derive pavement design and to define new standards for bridge loading.
Bank staff will encourage MPW to work out geometric and pavement specifica-
tions which could be adapted to later projects and various local conditions.
H.   Maintenance
2.22      Over the last two years there have been considerable increases
in the annual appropriations for road maintenance (para. 2.15). The current
appropriations would be adequate for routine and periodic maintenance with
some to spare for restoring earth and gravel roads to a level at which they
can be kept in adequate condition by routine maintenance. One objective of
the proposed project is to improve the programming and recording of road
maintenance thus making it more certain that resources allocated to road
maintenance are used for that purpose.
2.23      The consultants engaged to provide technical aid for road mainte-
nance under the Second Highway Project have completed an inventory of main
and secondary roads, and on each length of road they have established norms
for routine and periodic maintenance. District engineers have been provided
with machinery and workshop facilities, and operational staff have been
trained to maintain and operate the machinery. There is evidence that the
condition of some main and secondary roads has improved, indicating that the
program is having effect. But the detailed maintenance program planned by
the consultants is not yet being fully implemented. One reason is that as
yet there are not enough employees with adequate training and experience.
Another is that resources provided for road maintenance may be diverted to
other uses; it has proved difficult to induce district engineers to provide
records of work done and resources employed. One aim in the extension of the
consultancy service in the proposed project is to improve the planning and
management of road maintenance at district level (para 3.10).
2.24      The financing, planning and the organization of road mainte-
nance are undertaken from MPW headquarters in Monrovia. Local government
organizations are beginning to emerge in Liberia. Undoubtedly, this trend
should be encouraged. One aim, possibly long term, should be to decentralize
road maintenance, giving local authorities direct responsibility for maintain-
ing local roads in their areas. In the meantime, there is a need to provide
district engineers with greater incentive to manage road maintenance more



- 18 -
effectively. Currently, a tradition that road maintenance needs heavy equip-
ment is becoming established. On more lightly trafficked gravel roads, farm
tractors and drags could be used instead of graders for routine maintenance
of the surface; more generally the opportunity exists for building up a
lengthsman system in which some of the routine work of patching the road
surface and repairing potholes, and care of the verges and roadside drains
could be done by hand. These aspects will be considered in the extension
to the consultant services as part of the proposed project.
2.25      The amount of machinery and the workshop facilities are approaching
a reasonable level, and a steady stream of trained plant operators, mechanics
and road foremen is beginning to emerge from the consultants' training scheme
under the Second Highway Project and the training school at Camp Mechlin.
There is, however, a need to include in the consultants' program the training
of subprofessionals in the techniques of maintenance, repair and strengthening
of bituminous surfaced roads. A provision in the proposed project
is included to cover this field (para 3.05).
I.   Construction
2.26      Unlike many other African countries, Liberia still lacks on adequate
network of main roads; the work to improve it to meet the country's needs must
remain a first priority in the transport sector. There is also increasing
concern to build up the network of secondary and feeder roads. Thus, while
work to establish the main roads is likely to be necessary for at least
another decade, there is also need to expand the facilities available for
constructing secondary roads and feeder roads. A start on meeting this need
was made under the Third Highway Project and will be continued under the
forthcoming Feeder Roads Project.
2.27      Consultants are employed to undertake feasibility studies, detailed
engineering and supervision on main roads, and contractors are used for construc-
tion. MPW is seeking to improve its capacity to plan and engineer major con-
struction of roads and bridges; there are no domestic consultants as yet in the
highway field, and the few domestic contractors are as yet some distance short
of having the organization to prequalify for major highway construction. While
it will be necessary during the next few years to continue to employ international
consultants and contractors, a deliberate effort will be needed to develop local
capacity by arranging for both MPW and local contractors to be more involved in
the main road improvement program. Domestic contractors find ample opportunities
in work on minor roads; there are likely to be increasing opportunities on main
roads for subcontracting for the supply of materials and for specific aspects of
construction in which they can develop special skills.
2.28      The Bank's main effort in building up the secondary and feeder road
system of Liberia will come as part of the proposed Feeder Road Project. Some
of this work wiLl be done by the MPW by force account, and some by local con-
tractors. The work is not of a nature to tempt international contractors;
nor is it desirable that they should be brought in for such work. But there
is clearly insufficient local capacity as yet to tackle a program of the size
likely to develop.



- 19 -
2.29      A study of the domestic construction industry undertaken by the
International Executive Services Corps (IESC) as part of the Second Highway
Project was completed in June 1977. Their report contains information useful
in developing the domestic highway construction industry. Domestic contrac-
tors do not have the competence necessary to undertake major contracts for
the construction of main roads. It is a long-term aim that they should, but
in the meantime there is likely to be plenty of other work in the htghway
field which can provide opportunity to build up a viable domestic contracting
industry. Such work includes the construction or reconstruction of secondary
and feeder roads, petty contracting or subcontracting for specific functions
and haulage contracting for road works. Domestic contracting for the supply
of materials was not covered in the IESC study. The current difficulties in
providing adequate supplies of crushed rock (para. 2.41) suggest that the
quarrying industry should also be included in any aid program for the domes-
tic construction industry.
2.30      There are two domestic highway construction contractors employed
in building and improving gravel roads as part of the USAID program. They
have a fair engineering competence but they need to develop their ability in
estimating, work planning, and financial control.
2.31      Technical aid will be necessary both to MPW and to the private
sector: to MPW to assist in developing their organization for planning
and supervising the work of contractors, and also to the industry through a
domestic commercial bank, in organizing their financial affairs. A memo-
randum has been prepared containing proposals for technical assistance to MPW
and domestic development banks for developing the domestic construction
industry and has been agreed upon in principle by the Government, and the
required technical assistance is being arranged as part of the Third Highway
Project (Loan 1156-LBR).
2.32      A line of credit (US$7.0 million) is available for industrial
development (Loan No. 1323-LBR, October 1976), through the Liberian Bank for
Development and Investment (LBDI). A proportion of this loan could be made
available to provide financial help to domestic contractors.
Appropriate Technology for Road Construction and Maintenance
2.33      A study commissioned by USAID in 1974 undertook to determine what
technologies were most appropriate in Liberia. The study concluded that there
is neither need nor opportunity to encourage labor-intensive road construction.
Demand for labor is high in rural areas during the dry season for tilling,
planting and harvesting; road construction, like agriculture, cannot proceed
in the wet season when surplus labor is available.
2.34      Thus the only motives for pursuing road-building technologies
different from those now in use are:
(a)  that they might be potentially cheaper; and
(b)  that they might encourage the local population to par-
ticipate in an activity important for the economic and
social development of their region.



- 20 -
The USAID study compared the costs of road construction by intermediate and
fully mechanized technologies. They concluded that intermediate technology,
employing machines to supplement labor only where necessary on technical
grounds, was in all cases more expensive than mechanized technology. It is
thus evident that machine-intensive technology is most appropriate for road
construction and maintenance in Liberia. Although this conclusion is likely
to remain generally valid, there are two important qualifications. First,
there is scope for using local resources for building and maintaining feeder
roads and tracks; the building of new secondary roads cannot connect all
villages and areas of agricultural production, and there is a mounting demand
to provide such connections. Tracks -- simple feeder roads negotiable by
robust, light vehicles -- are needed and local organizations are demonstrat-
ing a will to take part in building such roads. There is an opportunity to
nourish this local enthusiasm, with MPW's field divisions providing a minimum
of machinery for essential work that cannot be done by hand, and taking care
that the responsibility for constructing and maintaining these roads always
remains a local responsibility. This aspect will be pursued in more detail
in the proposed Feeder Roads Project. Second, there is manual work to do
on all highways in the wet season, in maintaining drainage systems in fully
operable condition and in emergency repairs to the running surfaces of all
types of road. This aspect will be pursued as part of the extension to the
maintenance consultancy in the proposed project.
J.   Environmental Aspects
2.35      No issues have been raised on the proposed project concerning either
damage to the environment or conservation of natural resources, nor can any
such issues be envisaged unless a concern for road safety can be regarded in
this light. Although reliable data are not available it is evident that the
toll from road accidents is high and increasing as the length of high-speed
main roads is increased. Government agreed during negotiations that the terms
of reference of the UNDP transport specialist (para. 1.18) be extended to
include advising on means to improve the reliability of road accident data to
provide a basis for formulating an effective road safety policy.
K.   Past Bank Assistance
2.36      The First Highway Project (Loan 368-LBR, US$4.25 million, 1964)
began in August 1965 and was completed in June 1969. The project consisted of
reconstructing two roads and supplying equipment for road maintenance. The
reconstruction of both roads was engineered by MPW; one was constructed by
a foreign contractor in consortium with a local firm. One road, Kle-Pujehun
(43.7 mi), is in fair condition with increasing amounts of maintenance re-
quired. The other, Paynesville-Robertsfield (28 mi), was completed in mid-1969.
Pavement failures rapidly became evident, and the road has needed continuous
repair to keep it in adequate condition to carry the increasing traffic. The
bituminous surfacing employed was pervious, permitting surface water to enter
the road base. The road base, made of local lateritic gravel suffered con-
siderable loss of strength when it became wet. Sealing of the road surface
arrested the rapid development of failure, but much of the road base had been



- 21 -
permanently weakened and subsequent rainy seasons have produced further areas
of failure needing repair. This experience -- a frequent one in the early
days of bituminous road construction in all African countries -- has provided
a useful lesson on the care needed in selecting materials and in supervising
the construction of such roads. Total project costs were US$7.00 million,
including an overrun of 16.4% over the appraisal estimate. The Government met
the full cost of the overrun.
2.37      The Second Highway Project (Loan 907/Credit 395-LBR, US$5.6 million,
1973) started in June 1973 and was completed at the beginning of 1978.
The project included technical assistance to reorganize and improve highway
maintenance and to review the domestic highway construction industry, the
purchase of highway maintenance equipment and workshop tools, and the con-
struction of the Monrovia Bypass. The project also included the detailed
engineering for (i) improvements to U.N. Drive (5.4 mi), to the Totota-Ganta
road (83 mi), to the Paynesville-Robertsfield road (28 mi), and to the Pay-
nesville-Totota road (71 mi) and to Water Street in Monrovia; and (ii) a new
bridge over the Mesurado river in Monrovia.
2.39      Reasonable progress has been made with the technical assistance.
The construction of the Monrovia Bypass has been completed with a small cost
overrun. The detailed engineering for U.N. Drive, the Mesurado River bridge
in Monrovia and the Totota-Ganta road was successfully completed and the works
are now under construction as part of the Third Highway Project. The detailed
engineering for the Paynesville-Robertsfield and Paynesville-Totota roads was
completed in June 1977. The design concepts for the reconstruction of the
Paynesville-Totota road were too expensive and the detailed engineering of
both roads required some revision to make sure that construction standards
were adequate for the expected traffic. One of the main activities in the
appraisal of the proposed Fourth Highway Project was revising the concept and
methods to be employed in improving these two roads, which are included in the
project.
2.40      The Third Highway Project (Loan 1156-LBR, US$27.5 million, 1975)
began in August 1975 and is scheduled for completion at the end of 1979.
Under this project, UN Drive in Monrovia and the Totota-Ganta road are being
reconstructed and the Mesurado river bridge is being constructed in Monrovia.
In addition technical assistance was provided for the Programming and Planning
Division of MPW: consultant services for (a) feasibility studies on extensions
to the main road system from Ganta to Sanniquellie and to Tapeta (about 90
miles in all); (b) detailed engineering of the Mount Coffee Dam Road; and (c)
a study of urban development in Monrovia, and assistance to equip and operate
a Feeder Road Construction Unit.
2.41      Construction works under the Third Highway Project are being under-
taken by foreign contractors with supervision from international consultants.
There have been delays on all three project items because of bad weather and
difficulties in the supply of materials, particularly crushed stone. The
quality of work done is good and, apart from the delays, progress is satis-
factory. Technical assistance to the Programming and Planning Unit is



- 22 -
proving effective. The feasibility studies are well in hand, as is the
urban development study. The detailed engineering of the Mount Coffee Dam
road has been deleted from the project because the feasibility study did not
show adequate justification for the work. The Feeder Road Unit started
working in February 1977 and is operating successfully in Lofa County in
association with the agricultural development project.

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
3.01      There are three broad objectives in the proposed Fourth Highway
Project:
(a) to continue to develop the main highway system of Liberia;
(b) to continue to develop local capacity to plan and execute
highway maintenance with increasing emphasis on management;
and
(c) to develop capacity within Government for highway planning.
B.   Description
3.02      The proposed project consists of:
(a) the improvement of the Paynesville-Totota road (71 miles);
(b) the improvement of the Paynesville-Robertsfield road
(28 miles);
(c) detailed engineering for the Ganta-Sanniquelli road (25 mi)
and the Ganta-Tapita road (65 mi);
(d) feasibility study for the Gbarnga-Voinjama-Kolahun road (152 mi);
(e) consulting services for the organization and execution of
road maintenance (continued from the Second Highway Project
with extended objectives); and
(f) technical assistance to the Planning and Programming
Division in the Ministry of Public Works.
3.03      Improvement of the Paynesville-Totota Road.  Plans for the improve-
ment of this highway, made by the consultant under the Second Highway Project,
invoLved complete reconstruction of the pavement over the whole length,
together with relocation to improve alignment at bends and over two lengths
totalling about ten miles, and strengthening of bridges. The condition of the
road suggests that only a portion of the pavement needs complete reconstruc-
tion; over most of the length an adequate and less expensive alternative is
to strengthen the pavement in stages over a period of years. Arrangements
to follow this alternative have been worked out with MPW and are described in
paras 3.04 and 3.05. Although the realignments might be judged desirable to
bring the layout up to a uniform standard, there is as yet little evidence
that they can be justified in the Liberian context by benefits in the form of
reduced journey times and improved safety (para. 2.35).



- 24 -
3.04      The studies for strengthening the pavement involve first a deflec-
tion survey, and then the preparation of revised estimates and contract docu-
ments. The deflection survey completed by consultants Davies and Associates
in February 1978 showed that less than 25% of the road needed reconstruction;
the remainder can be restored to have a design life of 15 years by local
repair and strengthening. Estimates have been revised accordingly.
3.05      The works will be supervised by international consultants and
undertaken by international contractors. Both will be required to employ a
stated minimum number of Liberian engineers in order to build up the stock
of Liberian engineers with experience in the strengthening and maintenance of
bituminous roads (para 5.01).
3.06      Improvement of the Paynesville-Robertsfield Road (28 mi).  This road
connects Monrovia with the main international airport at Robertsfield and the
area beyond Robertsfield. Faults in initial construction have required con-
tinuous efforts to keep the road in serviceable condition (para. 2.36). The
deflection survey has shown that some 70% of the pavement requires reconstruc-
tion and that the remainder can be restored by local repair and strengthening
to provide a pavement throughout with a design life of 15 years.
3.07      Detailed Engineering.  The proposed project provides for the de-
tailed engineering of the reconstruction of the Ganta-Sanniquellie road (25
mi) and the Ganta-Tappita road (65 mi). Feasibility studies undertaken as
part of the Third Highway Project are well advanced; final reports are ex-
pected by mid-1978. Arrangements for the detailed engineering will be re-
viewed by the Government and the Bank in the light of the conclusions of these
reports.
3.08      Feasibility Study.  The proposed project provides for a feasibility
study for the improvement of the Gbarnga-Voinjama-Kolahun road (152 mi). This
main road connects the developing areas of Lofa County with the main road from
Sanniquellie to Monrovia. At present, it follows a ground-hugging alignment
and, though surfaced with gravel, is difficult and slow to traverse, particu-
larly in wet weather. The rate at which traffic will develop is a key issue
in planning the improvement of the road. It is proposed to carry out the
feasibility study in two stages:
Stage 1.  A prefeasibility study to indicate the likely growth of
traffic, including that generated by agricultural develop-
ment (on the assumption that road user costs are reduced
to those appropriate on an improved road) and a prelimi-
nary estimate of cost of improving the road to standards
appropriate to a main road.
Stage 2.  A detaLled study of sections of the road selected on the
basis of the Stage I study, to refine the predictions
of traific growth, to undertake preliminary engineering
including cost estimates and to carry out the necessary
economic-engineering studies to indicate appropriate
standards and appropriate timing for improvement of the
selected lengths.



- 25 -
3.09      The Planning and Programming Division of MPW will undertake Stage 1.
After Stage 1 is completed, the Government and the Bank will review the find-
ings and select the most feasible improvements for detailed feasibility
studies by consultants in Stage 2 * Preliminary engineering of these selected
sections will be undertaken as part of Stage 2.
3.10      Technical Assistance for Road Maintenance.  The project provides for
retaining for another three years the consultants who are giving technical aid
in planning and executing road maintenance. The consultants have made good
progress in training staff in the physical operations of maintaining earth and
gravel roads. Progress has been slower in building up expertise within MPW on
the planning and organization of road maintenance at the district level and
on exercising the necessary financial controls. With this in mind, revised
objectives, outlined in Annex 4, have been prepared for the extension of con-
sultants' services and agreed upon with the Government.  The revised objectives
provide for civil engineering assistance (one engineer and four technicians)
to cover the preparation and implementation of the road maintenance program,
and mechanical engineering assistance (one engineer and four master mechanics)
to assist in building and operating the central and field workshops, in operat-
ing the road maintenance machinery and in training operators and mechanics.
Three of the technicians and three of the master mechanics will be attached to
District organizations in the field. In addition, an administrative expert
will be attached to the Bureau of Operations in MPW to implement proposals
that have been prepared for work programming and control, budgeting and cost
accounting, and a warehousing expert will be provided to put into use an
effective scheme for the procurement and issue spare parts and equipment in
central and field warehouses. These arrangements together with a commitment
from MPW to provide suitably qualified counterpart staff were confirmed
during negotiations.
3.11      Technical Assistance in Highway Planning.  One of the outstanding
needs is to develop local capacity in transport planning. The project pro-
vides for continued technical aid to MPW in building up the expertise of PPD
for highways. Two experts are envisaged, each for two years: one transport
economist and one traffic engineer. The latter would continue assistance
started under the Third Highway Project. Terms of reference are presented
in Annex 2 and were agreed upon at negotiations. Technical training for four
Liberian students abroad is also included in the project.
C.   Project Cost and Financing
3.12      The total cost of the project, net of taxes, is estimated at US$28.79
million of which US$21.21 million are foreign costs. No taxes or duties are
levied on projects financed by the Bank in Liberia except for income tax on
wages and salaries of local staff. Thus no component for local taxation is
shown in the estimates. Project costs are summarized in the table on page 26.
These estimates reflect prices as of June 1978 with appropriate allowances for
price adjustments and for physical contingencies.   Price adjustments have
been calculated at 9% for 1978, 8% for 1979, and 7% for subsequent years.
Detailed estimates for each component of the project, showing the contingency
allowance on each, are given in the table on page 31.

3.13      The costs of the civil works on the Paynesville-Totota road and
the Paynesville-Robertsfield road have been derived from revised estimates
prepared by the consultant after completion of the deflection survey. The
costs are considerably influenced by the unit price of crushed stone which
has increased considerably during the last two years. Because of this the
Bank has requested and the Government has agreed that in the contract docu-
ments cement-stabilized gravel be included as an alternative to crushed stone
as road base.
3.14      The cost of construction supervision was estimated in detail and
amounts to about 7% of construction costs. The cost of road preinvestment
studies is based on the cost of similar services rendered in Liberia. Esti-
mates for the road maintenance program are derived from the revised program
prepared by consultants Sauti and agreed by the Government and the Bank
(Annex 4). The program involves 420 man-months for the consultants' staff,
at a cost of US$7,500 per man-month. There are no cost-of-living allow-
ances. Estimates for technical assistance to MPW have been estimated on a
man-month basis using similar rates.
3.15      The Kuwait Fund has agreed to provide parallel financing for the
foreign costs of the improvement of the Paynesville-Robertsfield road; this
foreign cost is estimated at US$7.4 million and includes the cost of road
safety devices and of construction supervision. Negotiations between the
Government and the Kuwait Fund are scheduled for mid-May 1978. The remaining
foreign costs of US$13.8 million would be financed by the Bank. The Govern-
ment will meet all local costs of the project. Retroactive financing by the
Bank to a maximum of US$0.2 million is provided in order to ensure continuity
in the consultancy services for road maintenance after July 1, 1978.
D. Implementation
3.16      MPW will be responsible for execution of the proposed project.
MPW will be assisted by consultants in planning and supervising the construc-
tion works, detailed engineering and technical assistance for highway mainte-
nance. The project will take four years to complete, from July 1, 1978 to
June 30, 1982. The timing of the various activities in the project is as
shown in below:

3.17     The Government wishes to start work as soon as possible on the
Paynesville-Robertsfield road, and they have prepared a short list of con-
tractors previously prequalified for other roads.  If the Kuwait Fund accepts
bids being calle!d from the short-listed contractors, work could start at the
beginning of the 1978-1979 dry season.
E.  Procurement
3.18     The improvement of the Paynesville-Totota road would be undertaken
by contract awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. Prospective bidders would have to
be prequalified. Bidding documents would include an appropriate price adjust-
ment clause. The works would be supervised by consultants on terms acceptable
to the Bank.
3.19     The improvement of the Paynesville-Robertsfield would be carried
out by a contractor and works supervision would be undertaken by consultants
on terms acceptable to the Kuwait Fund.
3.20     The detailed engineering and the feasibility study would be under-
taken by consultants who would be appointed by MPW following Bank Group
Guidelines for the use of consultants. The Government has proposed that
consultants Sauti be invited to continue their work for road maintenance
begun under the Second Highway Project. This arrangement is satisfactory to
the Bank. Technical assistance to MPW, would be provided by qualified and
experienced consultants following procedures, and on terms, acceptable to the
Bank.
F. Disbursements
3.21     All project components except the improvement of the Paynesville-
Robertsfield road will be financed by the Bank Loan; disbursements will be
distributed as follows:



- 29 
(i) 72% of total costs of civil works on the improvement of
the Paynesville-Totota road (i.e. 100% of the estimated
foreign costs);
(ii) 100% of foreign expenditure on supervision of the civil
works on the improvement of the Paynesville-Totota road
(86% of total costs);
(iii)  100% of foreign expenditure on detailed engineering of
the Ganta-Sanniquellie and Ganta-Tappita roads (80% of
total costs);
(iv) 100% of foreign expenditure on the feasibility study of
the Gbargna-Voinjama-Kolahun road (86% of total costs);
(v) 100% of foreign expenditure on consultancy services for
the road maintenance program (76% of total costs); and
(vi)  100% of foreign expenditure for the technical assistance
to MPW (82% of total costs).

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
4.01      Liberia's main road network is rudimentary.  The 1976-80 Plan gives
high priority to development of road infrastructure with particular impor-
tance having been assigned to the of the Paynesville-Totota and Paynesville-
Robertsfield roads. The proposed project continues the work done as part of
previous Bank projects to improve the paved highway network.  In addition,
the project is designed to complete building up the Government's highway main-
tenance organization and execution of its work, and to establish a domestic
capability for transport planning.
4.02      The proposed improvement of the two roads is justified and expected
to yield a combined economic return (ER) of about 21%. The other elements of
the project (consulting services for road maintenance and technical assistance
to MPW) were not included in the ER calculation. They are partly an extension
of technical assistance: (i) in the maintenance program which has a 30% rate
of return (Second Highway Project) and (ii) in the Planning and Programming
Division (MPW), which is geared to strengthen the Government organization in
the transport sector, increase its efficiency and enable it to prepare future
projects.
1.   Improvement of the Paynesville-Totota Road (71 mi)
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.03      The bulk of project benefits for these works is related to (i) sav-
ings in avoiding reconstruction costs, and (ii) savings in vehicle operating
costs (voc) from the improved road condition. Additional benefits derive
from savings in road maintenance expenditures.  Other expected benefits are:
time savings and reduction of road accidents, which were not included in the
computation of economic return; the first are considered to be marginal and
the latter were difficult to quantify due to lack of reliable data. The main
benefits are to be obtained from the introduction of a phased strengthening
program to avoid full reconstruction. The road pavement has been deteriorating
due to increasing traffic. The damage is such that it cannot be repaired in
the course of regular or periodic maintenance; it has approached the level at
which vehicle operating costs are being affected. If no changes are made, the
pavements will collapse in the near future (1984-1985) and will have to be
completely reconstructed.
4.04      It is expected that, in the first round of distribution, the major
beneficiaries of transport cost reductions will be the local truck owners
and operators. Some of the cost reductions are likely to be passed on to the
farmers and their families in the zone of road influence, in the form of higher
farmgate prices due to lower transport costs or slower increases in transport
costs because of the competitive situation in the road transport industry.
Consumers are also expected to benefit from the reduced transport cost.
Private car and taxi owners would benefit directly from reduced vehicle



- 33 -
operating costs. Some benefits are expected to be passed on to passengers
since there is competition in inter-urban passenger transport. The project
is also expected to produce general benefits to other sectors, such as
promoting an increase in marketed agricultural production (in the road zone)
and to the economy as a whole by improving part of the most important main
road in the country. It is not feasible, however, to estimate quantitatively
how project benefits would diffuse to the Government, among the population
and to different economic sectors.
(b) Area of Influence of the Project Road
4.05      Paynesville-Totota is a section of the Monrovia-Ganta road, the
backbone of the country's road network. It provides the link from Monrovia,
the capital city and principal port, to regions in the northwest and south-
east; it also connects with the Ganta-Harper road in the east and is the
only direct route to Guinea and Ivory Coast. The main traffic-generating
activities in the areas directly served by the road through feeder roads are
cash crop cultivation by farmers, rubber production by foreign companies and
Liberian farmers, and exploitation of timber resources; planned cooperative
developments will also soon be making significant contributions to production
in the area.
4.06      In the road zone of direct and indirect influence, a few develop-
ment projects have started (e.g. Bank-financed rural development projects in
Bong and Lofa Counties). The project road traverses two populated counties
(Montserrado and Bong) with increasing agricultural activity. According to
estimates of the Ministry of Planning (for 1975) there are about 90,000 acres
cultivated in the hinterland of Paynesville-Totota road. Major crops are
rice, 17,000 t; cassava 10,000 t; and sugar cane 14,000 t. In addition, part
rf the country's important rubber production is along this road (about 12,000
t); there is also some coffee and cocoa production. The agricultural produc-
tion in the zone of road influence is expected to increase in the future par-
ticularly if agricultural projects envisaged in the 1976-80 Plan materialize.
(c)  Economic Analysis
(i)  Traffic
4.07      The traffic on the road was regularly counted in the period 1967-
1977.  It showed a steady growth of 6-7% annually but the traffic volumes
were not evenly distributed along the road. In 1977, the average traffic
on the first section was about 3,000 vehicles per day (vpd), on the second
section about 1,600 vpd, gradually decreasing to about 850 vpd on the last
section. The traffic composition on the project road in 1977 showed an
average of about 70% of light vehicles on all sections. Some 15% were trucks
and trailers, and the remainder were pick-ups and light buses. The traffic
structure is explained by the high density of population along the road and
its importance as a major social and administrative link to the north, north-
west and southeast.
4.08       Since the project road is part of the important Monrovia-Ganta
road the network traffic volumes are relatively high. At the beginning of
1981 when improving the project road is expected to be completed, on
the basis of the past growth, the normal traffic on the first section is



- 34 -
projected to be about 3,800 ADT, on the second about 2,000 ADT, and on the
third about 1,100 ADT. The improvement of the road is expected to generate
only a minor volume of additional traffic since it has been paved for about
20 years. The generated traffic, therefore, was not taken into accqunt in
the computation of the rate of return. In the first 10 years of the road's
ecconomic life, average growth of traffic is estimated at 6.5% p.a., tapering
thereafter to 5% p.a. (Annex 1).

(ii) Vehicle Operating Costs
4.09       Transport costs on the road are based on operating typical vehicles;
they are presented in the table below. The present road was paved in 1957/58
and is still in generally fair condition over most of its length. However,
due to the high and increasing traffic volume the road would gradually deterio-
rate to poor condition if there were no project, and would require full recon-
struction by 1984-85 and 1989.  After the improvement proposed in the project,
vehicle operating costs are expected to be reduced by about 13% - 23% depend-
ing on vehicle type and extrapolated time for VOC savings in the economic life
(until 1985/89). Consequently, in economic analysis, in addition to savings
in VOC, deferred construction costs are also important benefits.

(iii) Improvement and Maintenance Costs
4.10       Cost estimates, net of taxes at mid-1977 prices, of the road
strengthening are shown below.

Total                                       11,585
The works will include strengthening of specific road sections; the works are
estimated to take 30 months to complete (1978-1980). The improvement should
be completed early in 1981. No further pavement strengthening is estimated to
be needed before 1996. However, surface dressing after 7 years is envisaged.
Road maintenance costs have been assumed with and without the project, and the
latter case takes into account extrapolation of MPW actual expenditures on the
road (Annex 1). Even though the road carries relatively high traffic, the
proposed technical solution is less costly and yields higher economic return
than full reconstruction of the road.
(iv) Economic Return
4.11       Based on the improvement works an economic life of 15 years was
estimated. Economic analysis of the abovementioned costs and benefits shows
that improvement of the Paynesville-Totota road is well justified. The
overall economic return is estimated at 20% under the traffic growth rate
estimate. A separate analysis has also been carried out for each section of
the road. On the sections the ER are between 19% and 22%. The results are
presented below, ER are rounded. An additional economic return was calculated
assuming full reconstruction of the road. In that case reconstruction costs
were estimated at US$17.2 million and included in a 20-year economic life.
Based on savings in voc and in road maintenance cost, the economic return is
18%.

(v) Sensitivity
4.12       The various components of the economic evaluation have not been
estimated with equal degrees of reliability. To determine the sensitivity of
the ER to variations in the estimated costs and benefits (from the sensitivity
to duration of economic life), an analysis was carried out, assuming overall
increase in costs and decrease in benefits separately and simultaneously. The
results of this analysis, which are summarized above, indicate that, with costs
increasing or benefits decreasing by as much as 20% the ER would still remain
above 10-12%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Liberia. Since
there is a possibility that the economic life of the proposed works may be
less than 15 years, additional calculation of ER was carried out assuming an
economic life of 10 years; under these conditions the economic return ranges
from 18% to 21% for different sections. ER was not sensitive to the test
since most of the benefits end by 1990, because the last portions of the road
would have been reconstructed by that time as anticipated in the "without
project" case (Annex 1).
2.   Improvement of Paynesville-Robertsfield Road (28 mi)
(a) Area of the Road Influence and its Main Beneficiaries
4.13      The Paynesville-Robertsfield road is an important stretch of the
only coastal road providing the link between Monrovia and Buchanan, an
important port and the second largest town in the country. The road also
connects the country's main international airport with the capital. The main
traffic-generated activities in the road zone are rubber plantations, mostly
owned by the Firestone Company, and the airport traffic. According to the
estimates of the Ministry of Planning (for 1975), there are about 80,000
acres cultivated in the hinterland of Paynesville-Robertsfield road. The



- 37 -
major crop is rubber, about 36,000 t/p.a. (Firestone's share is about 76%).
In addition, some 10,000 t of sugar cane and about 5,000 t of cassava and
rice each are produced annually in the road vicinity. The productiPn volume
of other crops is marginal.
4.14      The bulk of project benefits lerive from (i) savings in W(C; (ii)
savings in deferred recoLstruction cost3; and (iii) savings in road mainte-
nance expenditures.  There will also be savings in reduction of road accidents
and some time savings which were not included in the quantitative analysis of
economic return.
4.15      Most of the benefits from the reduction in transport costs will
accrue to passengers (since there is competition among carriers) ano to owners
of light vehicles (about 90% of the whole traffic) going to and from Monrovia
to the international airport, Buchanan and other places. Some benefits will
be passed on to owners of rubber plantations and some farmers in the road
zone due to delays in increasing transport cost and better service since the
road has been closed to traffic during heavy rains.
(b) Economic Analysis
(i)  Traffic and Vehicle Operating Cost
4.16      The traffic on the road is the heaviest in the country.  It has
been regularly counted since 1966 and shows a steady growth of about 6-7%
annually. The traffic volumes are almost evenly distributed reachinig an
average about 2,400 vpd in 1977. However, most of the traffic is passenger
cars; taxis and vans make up 90% of the total traffic which is explained by
the services provided by the road. About two-thirds of the total traffic
serves the area between Monrovia and the airport, leaving about 36% to
contirlue beyond the airport mostly to rubber plantations and Buchanap, with
about 23% of the total traffic continually to Buchanan. Since the road was
paved more than 10 years ago and the traffic pattern and growth rate are well
established, no generated traffic was taken into account. In early 1981 when
the improvement will be completed, the normal traffic is expected to be between
2,900-*3,300 vpd. Average annual traffic growth is estimated at 6.5%.

The road is in worse condition than the Paynesville-Totota road, partly due
to higher traffic and to flooding caused by poor drainage during the rainy
season. If not improved as proposed, the road will need complete reconstruc-
tion in 5 years time. Vehicle operating costs are presented in paragraph
4.09. The savings from VOC are made on the basis of the difference of between
''without the project" case estimating the road surface to be in poor condition
and on the new paved road.
(ii)  Improvement and Maintenance Costs
4.17      Cost estimates, net of taxes at mid-1977 prices, of the road are
shown below.
Item                                    Cost
(US$'000)
Civil Works (including physical contingencies of 10%)    5,680
Supervision                                                    495
Cost of Studies                                                150
Total                                                  6,325
Road improvement is estimated to occur in three years (1978-1980) and the
works will be completed, at the latest, in early 1981. Actual road mainte-
nance expenditures have been relatively high; they have been estimated at
US$1,500-$2,000/mile per year, since the Government has been trying to keep
this important road open for traffic in spite of its constant deterioration
(Annex 1).
(iii) Economic Return and Sensitivity
4.18      Based on the type of work planned - improvement to two-lane bitu-
minous paved standard - an economic life of 15 years was estimated. Economic
analysis of the above-mentioned costs and benefits involved in the road
improvement demonstrate that the proposed works on Paynesville-Robertsfield
road are well justified. The economic return is 22%. Since the various
components of the economic evaluation have not been estimated with equal
accuracy, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. If the costs are increased
by 20%, ER is 16%.  Assuming simultaneous overall increases in costs (+20%)
and decreases in benefits (-20%) the economic return is about 11% still
satisfactory sinc:e the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Liberia is
10-12% (Annex 1).
3.   Other Project Elements
4.19      The extension of technical assistance for road maintenance under
the proposed project puts increased emphasis on building up capacity within
MPW to plan and organize road maintenance in more economical ways. An im-
provement of 15% in the efficiency with which maintenance funds are used is
well within expectation.



- 39 -
4.20      The project also provides technical assistance for the Planning
and Programming Division (MPW). The benefits of the assistance couLd not be
quantified, but in addition to training of PPD personnel, it is an important
institution-building element of the project, particularly to pave the way for
highway sector lending. The technical assistance is economically justified
and is expected to prepare a comprehensive road network development plan.
The proposed feasibility study (152 mi) is well justified; it is to determine
appropriate timing and level of improvement for the only road connerting
economically active Lofa County in the north with the rest of the ciuntry.
Provision for detailed engineering (90 mi of roads) will materialize~ only if
the feasibility studies now underway justify it.
B.   Risks
4.21       In the improvement of the Paynesville-Totota and Paynesvi'le-
Robertsfield roads, part of the works consists of strengthening the existing
road pavement which is of variable quality. The risks associated wLth this
procedure have been minimized by the deflection survey which provided quanti-
tative information on the variability of the old pavement and on the strength-
ening required. Remaining risks are associated with possible price fluctua-
tions, particularly of crushed stone and asphalt. It seems likely that the
price of these two main components has stabilized and it is possible that as
the efficiency of quarrying operations in Liberia become more effic-ent, the
price of crushed stone may fall from its current high level.
4.22       In the technical assistance cvmt  lents of the project there are un-
certainties of a different nature. The two components, in road maintenance,
and highway planning are directed to building up the efficiency of Fovernment
institutions. The speed with which these local institutions can be built
up to a level at which they can operate at full efficiency without outside
assistance, depends on Government responsiveness in pursuing the matter and
on the rate at which the Liberian professional staff can acquire the necessary
knowledge and experience.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01        During negotiations on the proposed loan, the following items were
discussed and agreed upon with the Government and specified as special condi-
tions in the Loan Agreement:
(i) the allocation of adequate local funds in the 1980-1982 budgets
to provide for routine and periodic maintenance of roads as
indicated in annual maintenance programs and a yearly review by the
Government and the Bank of progress in improving the organization of
road maintenance (para 2.16);
(ii) the provision of local staff of adequate competence to plan,
supervise and execute annual road maintenance programs (para
3.10);



- 40 -
(iii) arrangements for Liberian engineers to be employed by
international contractors on Bank-aided construction
projects (para. 3.05).
5.02      During negotiations, agreement were reached with the Government on
the following items:
(i)  outline terms of reference of technical assistance for
organization and execution of road maintenance (para. 3.10),
(ii)  procurement procedures (paras. 3.18-3.20); and
(iii)  financial arrangements for the capital cost of the project
(para 3.15).
5.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$13.8 million
on normal Bank terms.

LIBERIA
PROPOSED FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference for Experts to be attached to Programming and
Planning Division of MPW
Background
The Third Highway Project provides technical assistance of an en-
gineer for 18 months in the Programming and Planning Division (MPW). The
assistance will be expanded under the proposed project to two experts for
24 months each, a transport economist and a traffic engineer. Their major
task will be to prepare a comprehensive and coherent long-term program of
road network development.
1.   The transport economist will assist in:
(i) establishing road investment priorities, including those
for feeder roads;
(ii) establishing a long-term investment plan for the highway
sector;
(iii) participating in preparation of feasibility studies for
construction of new roads or improvement of existing
ones;
(iv) establishing operating costs for representative types of
vehicles under various road conditions;
(v) carrying out a study on structure and level of road user
charges;
(vi) organizing and operating a data bank within the Division
to assemble and interpret economic data related to
development of road network;
(vii) establishing an operating manual for the Division
activities; and
(viii)  training Liberian personnel in all the above activities.
2.        The traffic engineer will assist in execution of all the tasks
listed under items (i) through (vii) above, and will also assist in:



ANNEX 2

(i) establishing a systematic traffic counting system, including
data collection and analysis;
(ii) reviewing and, if necessary, updating present road classi-
fications;
(iii) reviewing existing traffic regulations, and formulating
recommendations oft desirable new legislation, particularly
with regard to vehicle axle-load limits;
(iv)   reviewing existing road design and maintenance standards
and construction practices for various road categories,
including feeder roads, and assist in establishing
new ones; and
(v) teaching Liberian personnel in all the above activities.



ANNEX 3
Page 1
LIBERIA
PROPOSED FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference for a Position Paper on the
Reorganization of Transport Planning and Coordination
I.   Background
1.        Development of the transport sector needs improvement in planning
and coordination between different modes. Several different Ministries and
Government organizations have been involved in the sector: Ministry of Pub-
lic Works (MPW); Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Transportation (MCIT),
Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA); National Port Authority
(NPA), Ministry of Justice, etc. Improvements in transport planning are
handicapped by the division of responsibility and lack of clarity of func-
tions, qualified personnel and funds.
2.        In the letter of July 16, 1977, the Government of Liberia agreed
to the principle that the responsibility for planning and coordination of
the transport sector should be entrusted to the MCIT, specifically to its
Bureau of Transportation (BT). It was also agreed that a Position Paper
should be prepared: first, clarifying the roles and field of responsibility
of the several organizations involved; second, outlining proposals for
changes, designed to improve efficiency and coordination; and third, setting
forth detailed proposals for the organization and staffing and training, and
the initial work program of the Bureau of Transportation with its expanded
functions.
II. Tasks of Transport Specialist
3.        The transport specialist should investigate related legislative,
institutional, financial and staffing problems and should present specific
recommendations on how to strengthen the Bureau of Transportation (MCIT)
and enable it to perform its integrated functions in transport planning and
coordination between different transport modes. MCIT is basically expected
to coordinate the work of the related ministries and other entities concerning
the sector, and not to exercise any executive power on transportation activi-
ties for which the related ministries have executive responsibility. The
paper is expected to be prepared within two months.
4.        The expert will, in close coordination with MCIT, MPW, NPA, MF, MPEA
and other Government entities:
