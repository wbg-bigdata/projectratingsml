I. THE NONFORMAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING SUBSECTOR
Background
1.01      During the past decade Indonesia's formal education system has
expanded rapidly resulting in a net enrollment rate of 98% at the primary
level, and gross enrollment rates of 35% at the junior secondary level, 22% at
the senior secondary level, and 4% at the tertiary level, respectively for
1980/81./1 Despite such rapid expansion of the formal school system, about
20% (18 million) of the Indonesian population aged 7-44 years remains illi-
terate. In addition to this large number of illiterates, there is a growing
number of school dropouts who contribute to a pool of some 19.2 million under
and unemployed persons. Over the decade of the 1970s about 17 million chil-
dren did not complete primary school and in 1980/81 alone about 1.2 million
children dropped out of primary school. Between 1980 and 1985 the labor force
in the 15-24 age group is expected to increase from about 13 million to 15
million. A large proportion of this age group will enter the labor force with
less than full primary education and minimal or no employable skills.
Organization and Financing of Nonformal Education
1.02      The Directorate General for Nonformal Education, Youth and Sports
(DGPLSPO) (Chart 1) in the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) has the
major responsibility for providing basic educatior. and training (functional
literacy, numeracy and basic skill training) to the out-of-school population
through a national program of nonformal community education (Dikmas). The
Dikmas organization and program is aimed at school leavers, dropouts and
illiterates aged 7-44, as well as those adults in need of further training to
become more productive citizens. The Dikmas programs are administered through
a network of regional and district offices and resource centers (BPMs and
SKBs), subdistrict fieldworkers (Peniliks), and village tutors and
facilitators.
1.03      Dikmas activities are complemented by activities of other govern-
mental agencies and nongovernmental organizations which also undertake
nonformal education programs in Indonesia. For example, the extension units
of the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Social Affairs, and Interior
(community development) and such nongovernmental bodies as the women's family
welfare movement, scout movement, and student service and youth volunteer
programs are all engaged in community nonformal education activities. In
1980, a Junior Minister for Youth Affairs, whose responsibilities include
promoting training and guidance for out-of-school youth, was appointed. He
reports directly to the President, indicating a rise in the status and
importance of such nonformal education activities.
1.04      Growing government concern for nonformal education activities is
reflected in the increasing share allocated to Dikmas in the overall MEC
budget. From a budget of US$1.9 million in 1975/76, the Dikmas budget grew
/1 Ministry of Education and Culture Statistics and Comparative Education
Indicators (Annex 1).

to a total of US$16.2 million in 1980/81, an average annual growth rate of
43%. During the same period, total allocations to DGPLSPO rose from US$4.3
million to US$24.8 million, an increase of 34% p.a. In 1975/76, expenditure
on Dikmas programs represented abouit 0.5% of the MEC budget as compared to
4% in 1980/81. Comparable figures for the DGPLSPO are 3.6% in 1975/76 and
6.5% in 1980/81. During the past 'ix years Dikmas expenditure per person in
the target population has also increased significantly from the equivalent
of US$0.05 in 1975/76 to about US$0.56 in 1980/81, a growth rate of about
47% p.a.
Key Issues in Nonformal Education
1.05      The First Nonformal Education Project (Loan 1486-IND) approved in
August 1977 had three major objectives:
(a) strengthening Dikmas capacity to provide effective village
nonformal education programs, including direct and flexible
funding of village-level learning activities;
(b) improving the quality of nonformal programs through the
creation of institutions to develop, produce and distribute
improved learning materials and the establishment of a system
for in-service training; and
(c)  reinforcing management and supervision capabilities through
agency reorganization and the introduction of continuous
evaluation.
1.06      Loan 1486-IND, scheduled for completion in June 1984, has
largely accomplished these goals whtich has resulted in a revitalization of
the Dikmas organization.  A major mid-term review was conducted in
December 1981. While the review was unable to assess impact, e.g. learning
gains, it did provide substantial evidence on such measures as participation
rates to warrant proceeding with a second phase project. Major accomplish-
ments of the First Nonformal Education Project are described below.
1.07      Provision of Effective Nonformal Education Programs.  Under the
project a core of complementary education programs in basic literacy, family
life education, vocational training, and small-scale enterprises were devel-
oped. In 1977-78, at the start of the project, Dikmas programs reached
about 400,000 learners. By the end of 1982, approximately 5 million learners
had been assisted by Dikmas programs of which 4.4 million were in basic educa-
tion classes and the remainder in vocational training and small business
development. The small business component (called Learning Funds) was an
experiment in the creation and operation of small-scale enterprises.
Approximately 2,700 learning and production groups were established in four
years. Based upon their ability to sustain an economic activity and provide
increased incomes to participants, about two-thirds of these groups were
successful. Through the project an allocation of US$155 (1983 prices) was
provided to each group as start-up capital. Each group was required to



- 3 -
accumulate savings until the total equaled the original allocation.  These
savings are used to start new groups, to which technical assistance is
provided by existing groups. More than 500 different types of businesses
have been helped by the First Nonformal Education Prolect.  TUsing data
gathered during prolect preparation, it is estimated that the individual
rate of return to investment (rate of growth of individual income compared
to rate of growth of the cost of training) is about 25%. This compares
favorably to a 22% rate of return to investment in primary school education
in Indonesia.
1.08      Learning Materials Development and Staff Training.  Between 1q78
and 1981 a system was set up to develop, produce and distribute basic
learning materials and create supplementary materials serving the needs of
the various learner populations. In four years approximately 18.5 million
basic literacy booklets were produced, while about 600 prototype posters,
slides, tapes, cassettes and other visual aids were developed. During the
same period, a field-based system of staff training was established empha-
sizing problem solving skills for program development and implementation at
the local level and stressing technical support skills at the district and
provincial levels.  Approximately 17,000 Dikmas staff and learning group
monitors and tutors were trained in the regional training and materials
development centers (BPMs).
1.09      Strengthening Management.  The creation of RPMs permitted the
integration and coordination of staff training, materials development and
evaluation. It permitted the creation of a direct line of communication
from the national to the local level and clarified operational functions at
each administrative level. It began the process of decentralization of
planning for operational activities to the provincial, district and local
levels thereby bringing program design closer to the learning locale. To
buttress the new organizational structure (see Table 1.1), a svstem was
created for the generation of quantitative data for program delivery, evalua-
tion, and administration.
1.10      Despite the basic attainment of project goals, the December 1981
mid-term evaluation of the project raised several issues related to the
scope, quality and management of the new programs.
1.11      Scope.  Although the First Nonformal Fducation Project covered the
seven most populous provinces, containing about ROX of the population of
Indonesia, there remains a need to intensify and expand services to these
provinces because they contain 5n% of the country's illiterates and a large
number of unemployed youth. There is also a need to expand nonformal
education programs outside Java to the Other Islands, particularly densely
populated areas such as Bali and high growth areas such as South Sumatera.
Poverty-stricken regions like East Nusa Tenggara also require increased
assistance.
1.12      Quality.  The evaluation revealed that the project had facilitated
access to basic education for large numbers of learners, provided them with
instructional materials and created a flexible institutional format in which
to learn. Nothwithstanding these achievements, substantial improvements could

be made in the content of learning materials and the use of participatory
teaching methods. Many learning group leaders and fieldworkers indicated
that the literacy materials are too technically specific. Weaknesses were
also noted in the organization of the small business program. In order to
provide effective technical support during the initial development period,
fieldworkers and tutors would require more training in marketing, simple
accounting, and business management techniques.
1.13      Management.  A review of the structure of the Dikmas organization
revealed that horizontal integration and communication between functional
units needed strengthening, and feedback from the field to decision-makers
needed reinforcement at every level. During the First Nonformal Education
Project, a method and instruments for collecting quantitative program
evaluation data have been developed. The mid-term evaluation cited a need
to collect performance data on program effectiveness, as well as data on
participation rates in order to strengthen overall planning and management.
Government Strategy
1.14      The government strategy is to address the problems of inequity,
under and unemployment and illiteracy in part through the provision of a
total education system which promotes nonformal community education as a
complement to the formal education system. Nonformal education provides
educational opportunity through programs of basic literacy, primary school
equivalency and craft training for those bypassed by the formal system and
those who have dropped out.
1.15      During the Fourth Five-Year Plan, 1984-89 (Repelita IV), the
Government is expected to continue Dikmas programs begun under Repelita III
to: (a) increase literacy in the national language by expanding access to
basic education through the formal and nonformal school system; and (b)
increase access to training in income-generating skills. The Government
plans to improve program quality and expand program coverage in all
provinces with the assistance of the Bank under the proposed second-phase
project and the involvement of domestic non-government organizations.
Bank Role
1.16      To date the Bank Group has financed 13 education projects in
Indonesia. Investments have pursued the main objectives of meeting critical
manpower requirements, improving quality, and increasing equity./l Partic-
ularly significant for the proposed project is the First Nonformal Education
Project (Ln. 1486-IND) which revitalized the Dikmas Directorate through
in-service staff training and basic literacy materials development
/1 To date, two OED Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) have been
prepared for education projects. The lessons of experience with these
two projects have been incorporated in the design of the proposed
project.



(paras. 1.06-1.09). Apart from education projects per se, the Rank is also
helping the Government to overcome specific short-term manpower constraints
through project-related training in projects in a variety of sectors (viz.
agriculture, power, coal development, populationi and health). More
recently, the Bank has embarked on a major in-service training project with
the Ministry of Public Works. Other donor assistance has included the
promotion of access to basic education, strengthening of secondary technical
and vocational schools, and providing staff development at the university
level. Major donors are the ITnitece States, Rritain, the Netherlands, Japan,
Australia, UNICEF, TJNDP and the Asian Development Rank.
II. TWE PROJECT
Objectives and Scope
2.01      In support of the Government's stress on poverty alleviation,
"spreading the fruits of development," and expanding opportunities for employ-
ment, the project would increase access to nonfcrmal education, improve the
quality of nonformal education programs, and strengthen the management
capability of Dikmas. The second phase would build on the experience of the
First Nonformal Education Project which covered 7 provinces, by expanding
the program to 10 additional provinces and giving greater emphasis to
overall Dikmas quality improvement.  The project would support: production
and distribution of learning materials to the 17 provinces covered under
the first and second phases, staff training in all provinces, including
institutional development, infrastructure investment costs and a portion
of the recurrent costs for the fourith five-year plan (1984-89). Tn
addition, it would provide direct assistance to basic education Drograms in
the poorest subdistricts of the country.
2.02      To achieve these objectives, the proie2t would provide funding for
civil works, furniture, equipment, 'Learning materials, technical assistance,
and operating costs to:
(a)  provide direct support to learning programs in basic education and
employment-oriented training to reach about 8S6,0o0  people in
selected poorest subdistricts who are in need of sulch training;
(b)  improve the quality of nonformal education programs bv estab-
lishing new provincial and district staff training and materials
development centers (BPMs and SKBs) and by strengthening existing
centers to: (i) develop learning materials relevant to learners'
needs; and (ii) provide training in program development and
operations to staff at all administrative levels; and
(c)  improve program implementation by strengthening the management
capability of Dikmas, including the introduction of improved
planning, monitoring and evaluation systems, and by carrying out
an applied research program.



-7-
Components
Increasing Access to Educational Opportunities - Expansion of Village
Learning Programs (US$31.6 million) /1
2.03      The proposed project would support two types of village learning
programs: (a) basic education programs for illiterates and dropouts from
primary school; and (b) employment-oriented training for under and unemployed
youth. The project would expand these programs from the initial seven
provinces (Annex 3, p. 1) financed under the First Nonformal Education Project
to an additional ten provinces (Annex 3, p. 2) selected in accordance with
the five following indicators: (i) total population; (ii) population density;
(iii) number of illiterates; (iv) number of school dropouts; and (v) youth
unemployment rate. Within the ten provinces the program would be concentrated
in 63 districts and 381 subdistricts selected on the same criteria as used to
select the provinces. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that it would establish criteria and procedures satisfactory to the
Bank for the selection of subdistricts in which employment-oriented training
groups and basic education learning groups supported under the project would
be located (para. 6.01(a)).
2.04      Basic Education.  The delivery system for learning programs would
continue to be structured around learning groups, except that the family life
groups, previously distinct from literacy classes, would be subsumed under the
basic education curriculum. Working in close cooperation with local govern-
ment officials and village leaders, fieldworkers would identify priority
village training needs and organize groups composed of about 10 villagers.
Each group would be led by a tutor who, in addition to teaching, would
schedule meetings (daily, semi-weekly, weekly), keep records of attendance,
and make administrative arrangements. Learning group tutors work with
Dikmas fieldworkers and monitors to manage learning activities by providing
the required resources, e.g. meeting site, resource persons, and funds. The
duration of the learning groups' activities depends upon training objectives
and previous educational experience of the participants, varying from a few
months to as long as two years.
2.05      The core learning material for basic literacy groups is a series of
booklets termed Paket A. The core material would provide the learner with a
sustainable literacy level. It contains basic information related to family
life (home economics, nutrition, health), civics, leadership, and prevoca-
tional skills. The project would provide funding for the production of about
30 million Paket Al-A100 booklets. About 4.5 million supplementary materials,
audiovisual aids and simulations would also be developed.
/1 This and subsequent cost figures indicate proposed outlays including
contingencies.



2.06      This component would assist the Government to establish 76,200 new
village groups conducting basic education classes in literacy (Bahasa
Indonesian) and numeracy through the financing of basic education funds
provided for the groups. The funding is based on total group enrollment and
funds would be used to purchase consumable learning materials. The field-
workers (Peniliks) would also be provided with motorcycles to improve
supervision of learning groups in the more remote rural areas.  The oroject
would thus finance assistance to approximately 762,200 learners. This
represents about 10% of the total number of persons (about 7 million) for
whom the Government plans to provide basic nonformal education during
Repelita IV.
2.07      Employment-oriented Training.  Employment-oriented training groups
would facilitate a flexible and ixtmediate Dikmas response to village specific
Learning and employment priorities and encourage active local participation in
the formulation of learning programs. In selecting activities for assistance,
the degree to which a proposed program would create productive skills,
generate income, enhance the effectiveness of other local development projects
and involve the least educated and poorest members of a community would be
taken into consideration (see Annex 2 for selection criteria).  Fieldworkers
and local officials would meet with residents to determine the types of skills
available in the community and the interest of residents in organizing small
businesses to meet local demand for desired goods and services. Group leaders
would have attained a high craft proficiency level and have some business
experience.  Each group member would make a counterpart contribution in kind
or in cash equal in total to at least 2% of the start-up costs. Croup members
would agree to a training schedule! and keep records of financial transactions.
The Departments of Industry, Agriculture, and Tlome Affairs would provide
technical support to the groups.  The Bank Rakvat Indonesia would provide
credit information to these pre--credit learning and production groups (see
para. 2.10).
2.08      The proposed project would support the expansion of employment-
oriented training groups initiatedL in the Firsi: Nonformal Education ProJect.
A total of about 19,500 groups (approximately ]LOO,000 individuals) would be
assisted. The Government proposes to support the creation of an additional
15,500 groups in the provinces assisted by Loan 1486-INT). In the 10 new
provinces, the project would support about 4,000 groups, making an average
of two groups per year to be established in the 381 selected subdistricts
over the proposed five-year period. This average annual target is
reasonable in light of experience gained under the first phase project.
2.09      The project would providLe from an Employment-oriented Fund an
average grant of Rp 200,000 (US$200-1983 prices) per group to cover
operating costs, i.e. mainly consumable materials and small equipment
purchases. This figure represents a 30% increase in the allocation accorded
under the First Nonformal Education Project wh-ich is based on a 1981 survey
of the funding requirements of 15 different types of small businesses and an
examination of 1982 fieldworker assessments of small business start-up



_ q _
costs. Supplementary training materials, audiovisual aids and simulations
developed in the BPMs and SKBs would also be provided to assist fieldworkers
in training the groups. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
the Government would establish criteria and procedures, satisfactory to the
Bank, for the selection of activities to be assisted by the
Employment-oriented Fund and for the replenishment of this Fund (para.
6.01(a)).
2.10      In order to strengthen available technical assistance and increase
prospects for expansion and the development of training groups into small
businesses, Dikmas is formalizing links with other government departments.
Agreements specifying joint consultation and shared programs have been
signed between Dikmas and the Ministries of Industry (October 22, 1q81),
Agriculture (August 15, 1982) and Home Affairs (January 24, 1983).
Discussions with the Bank Rakyat Indonesia are at an advanced stage.
Improvement of the Ouality of Educational Programs - Improvement of
Learning Materials and Staff Development (ITS834.1 million)
2.11      Establishment of new BPMs and SKBs and Strengthening of Existing
Provincial Offices and SKBs.  To support the expansion of village learning
programs through the improved quality of learning materials and staff
training programs, the proposed project would finance construction, and
equipment and furniture for three new )PMs ana for the establishment of
SKBs in 24 of the selected project districts.  Financing would cover
construction, equipment and furniture at these centers. The overall project
institutional target is shown in Table 2.1 below.
2.12      The BPMs would continue to improve Dikmas management capability by
integrating previously dispersed responsibilities for planning, staff train-
ing, materials development, and evaluation. The BPMs would: (a) oversee
the production and distribution of Paket A booklets; (b) develop supplemen-
tary materials to support basic literacy courses and employment-oriented
training groups; (c) develop materials for staff training courses; and (d)
implement the monitoring and evaluation of Dikmas activities. Based upon an
evaluation of the role of SKBs in the First Nonformal Education Project,
these institutions would be increasingly responsible for: (i) producing
locally relevant supplemental materials; (ii) training monitors and
village-level tutors; and (iii) promoting greater coordination between
Dikmas programs and those of other MFC departments.
2.13      Learning Materials Development.  The BPMs would be responsible for
the production of about 30 million Paket Al-AlOO literacy booklets and their
distribution to the 17 provinces through the district offices (Annex 3).
This core learning material would be supplemented by 900 different types of
instructional materials relevant to regionalized learning needs and prepared
by the BPMs according to national and regional plans agreed annually by the
Directorate, the national materials development centers (BP'KRs) and the RPMs
(Annexes 4 and 5).  The staff of the RPMs would be responsihle for field

service location planning techniques.
/e  The two national centers (BPKBs) serve a dual function as provincial
centers (BPMs) and are therefore included in this figure.
/f  While the project assistance to the village level programs would only
focus on the 7 provinces under the First Nonformal Education Project and
10 provinces under the proposecd project, the training centers would
provide in-service training to Dikmas staff from all of the nation's
provinces.



- 11 -
testing supplementary materials before mass production (see para. 2.22
below). SKBs would provide technical support to Dikmas fieldworkers in
preparing locally relevant supplementary materials to serve learning groups
within their area of responsibility.
2.14      Staffing.  Additional staff would be required for the expanded
program. New and existing staff would require further training to
improve the quality of Dikmas nonformal education activities. There are
about 4,500 existing Dikmas staff. About 1,381 new staff would be required
to cover the proposed project expansion plans. By the end of the project,
each of the country's 3,457 subdistricts should have one fieldworker.
Similarly, by 1987, all staff of the 3 new BPMs and 24 SKBs would have been
recruited and appointed. The number of professional staff in each of the
BPMs would be about 40, while in the SKBs the number would be about 17
(Annex 6). At negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that staff would be appointed or transferred to these new positions in
accordance with a schedule prepared by the Government and reviewed and
agreed with the Bank (para. 6.01(b)).
2.15      In-service Training.  During the project, approximately 717,000
staff-days of regular in-service training would be provided at the national,
provincial, and district levels as indicated in Table 2.2. Training would be
provided to: (a) improve planning and programming capability; (b) strengthen
technical support skills; and (c) improve Dikmas outreach.
2.16      While the project village learning programs and institutional devel-
opment are focused on 17 provinces, the project would expand and improve the
quality of Dikmas in-service training for staff from all provinces. During the
first three years of the project, the six existing BPMs would be responsible
for all in-service training of provincial and district level Dikmas staff.
By 1986/87, when the three new BPMs would be operational, the training
workload could be shared among the nine regional BPMs.
2.17      Improvement of Planning and Programming Capability.  Under the
project, annual training workshops focussed on policy, planning, and overall
management, would be organized for 162 project implementation unit (PIU)
staff, provincial Dikmas directors, and technical unit chiefs of the BPKBs
and the BPMs. To further strengthen the ability of the SKBs to provide
support to Dikmas activities at the subdistrict and village levels,
management and technical workshops would be held for 217 SKB chiefs and 434
technical staff. Training for SKB staff would be centered on the
identification of learning needs, the development, testing and production of
locally relevant learning materials, and the evaluation of project
activities.

2.18      Strengthening of Technical Support Skills.  To improve the perfor-
mance of BPMs, 540 key professional staff from the BPMs would attend an
annual workshop specialized in areas such as materials development, train-
ing, programming and evaluation. In order to improve their ability to
supervise fieldworkers and oversee Dikmas activities, 311 district-level
chiefs, 933 district field officers and technical staff, and about 1,500
Dikmas subdistrict chiefs would be trained in personnel management, training,
project administration, methods of monitoring and evaluation and
participatory leadership techniques. Building on the experience gained in
the First Nonformal Education Project, training for 3,457 subdistrict level
fieldworkers (Peniliks) would be more field-based and practically, rather than
theoretically, oriented. Training sessions would focus on improving
implementation skills, facilitating group discussion, producing learning
materials, training design and management and collecting data for program
evaluation.
2.19      Improvement to Dikmas Outreach.  Training for organizers, examiners
and trainers for private nonformal courses would be provided to enhance their
ability to use various training techniques, construct relevant curricula,
use audio-visual aids, and understand and conduct evaluation. Approximately
350 private sector nonformal education personnel would benefit from these
skill upgrading courses. To further expand the coverage of its nonformal
education activities, Dikmas plans to mobilize the support of local organiza-
tions which have initiated and financed a large number of basic education
groups within the country. Approximately 762 representatives from women's
and youth organizations, two from each of the 381 selected subdistricts of
the project area, would be trained to organize nonformal education groups.
Similarly - about 24,000 representatives of subdistrict and village govern-
ing councils would be trained to identify potential learning groups. To
provide adequate support for the expanded learning programs, approximately
12,700 monitors (one per ten tutors) would undergo training on recruitment of
tutors and learners and learning group administration, in order to assist
fieldworkers to assess learner needs and supervise basic education groups.
To alleviate the problems of inadequate supply of trained tutors, funds would
be provided to train 126,820 volunteer tutors from villages throughout the
country. In addition to instruction on how to teach adults and how to use
Paket A, the training program for tutors would be designed to enhance
competence in: (a) developing locally relevant learning materials; (b)
linking basic education courses with employment-oriented training
activities; and (c) assisting non-Bahasa Indonesia speakers to acquire
literacy and fluency in the language.
2.20      Technical Assistance and Overseas Training Fellowships.  To
support the materials development and in-service staff training programs,
444 man-months of domestic specialist services and 54 man-months of foreign
consultant services would be provided for the National Directorate and the
BPMs (see Annex 8). Key staff members in BPMs and provincial offices would



- 14 -
receive specialized training, either abroad or in-country, in  anagement,
program development, training design, learning materials development,
evaluation and nonformal education curriculum design. Fi nds g.ould be
allocated for 118 man-months of domestic fellowships for contracts with
local educational institutions to conduct training in the above six areas of
specialization plus computer application for BPM and provincial ceotter staff
(see Annex 9). During negotiations assurances were ob-tained t-hat the
Government would establish criteria and procedures sat-sfactory to the Bank
for the award of fellowships [para. 6.01 (c)l
2.21      In addition to the in-service training described above the project
would continue to support Dikmas pre-service training through the Di Diploma
Course offered by the secondary teacher training colleges (IKI7Ps3>  Started
in 1980, the D1 program is a joint project between Dikinas and the IKIPs to
train students in nonformal education through a competency-based erriculum,
including field practice. Over 680 students have graduated from the program
and a large majority have been appointed as staff in tlhe SKBTs. The project
would finance pre-service field practicums for 2,000 students who would
provide a pool of graduates for recruitment and appo-inotinera   to the Dikmas
staff.
2.22      At negotiations, assurances were obtained from, tie Government that
it would ensure adequate field testing of instructiona'l materials developed
under the project, using sampling procedures satisfactory to the Bank, and
undertake any necessary revisions arising from such testing, prior to mass
production of any such materials [para. 6,01 (d)] Furthermore, in the
context of the proposed joint Bank-Dikmas Annual Review, the Government
would furnish to the Bank for review and comment by September 1 each year, a
plan and budget detailing a training and materials development, production
and distribution program for the coming year and thereafter implement such a
plan, taking into account the Bank's comments [para. 6.0J(e)(>i)!.
Strengthening of Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and App"Led Research
(US$5.1 million)
2.23      Planning and Management.  While the First Nonformal Education
Project was successful in institutionalizing technical aspects of the Dikmas
program, especially in the areas of training and learning materials develop-
ment, there remains a need to improve the program planning and management
system. The Dikmas Directorate's planning capability would be strengthened
through the creation of a technical secretariat responsible for the
management of technical assistance and an expanded monitoring and evaluation
section described below. The project would provide about 30 staff months of
technical assistance to assist the Directorate in establishing an effective
planning and management system including an improved monitoring, evaluation
and research program.  To strengthen the process of decentralization begun
in the seven initial provinces of the First Nonformal EduCation Project
(under Decree 089), BPMs and SKBs would have increased responsibility for



- 15 -
preparing, pilot testing, producing and distributing locally relevant
learning materials and conducting field-based training in their use. To
make this effective the Government would have to extend the provisions of
Decree 089 to the ten provinces of the proposed project. At negotiations
assurances were obtained from the Government that it would extend the
provisions of Decree 089 to include the ten new project provinces by January
1, 1984 [para. 6.01(f)].
2.24      Monitoring and Evaluation.  The system (SPEM) which was developed
under the First Nonformal Education Project provides information on project
finances, as well as program activities. While this system has provided
Dikmas with accurate monthly financial and quarterly reports on attainment
of quantitative program goals, it has not yet become a fully effective
management tool since it does not provide relevant information on program
outcomes and qualitative assessment of achievements. In the proposed
project the monitoring and evaluation system would be extended to cover
identification of key program activities; determination of appropriate
performance measures and indicators; definition of supervision and
monitoring responsibilities of Dikmas staff at all levels; and design of
effective reporting and review activities, including feedback and follow-up.
Case studies would also be undertaken of the effectiveness of learning
programs and of the administrative system. The project would finance about
117 staff-months of technical assistance to assist in the design and
implementation of the modified system (Annex 8).
2.25      Computer-assisted Information System.  The project would include
financing for a computer-assisted information system in order to support the
management, monitoring and evaluation systems. More specifically this
system would: (a) increase Dikmas' capacity to analyze data generated by the
SPEM; (b) provide data more rapidly; (c) enable the organization to reply to
constituencies to which it is responsible; (d) maintain better project
accounts; (e) compare monthly, quarterly and annual expenditures with actual
program goal attainment; and (f) free SPEM staff from laborious manual data
collection to promote their involvement in data analysis and designing
program activities.
2.26      This system would consist of:  (a) one micro-computer and peri-
pherals, e.g. printers, at the Directorate office in Jakarta; (b) one micro-
computer each in West, Central and East Java; and (c) data capture units in
each of the remaining 13 provinces. Provision would be made for 36 man-
months of technical assistance to re-examine the current data collection
system and set up the new system (Annex 8). Staff training would include
instruction in the operation of the new system.
2.27      Mid-term and Final Evaluations.  As a supplement to the activities
described above, mid-term and final evaluations would be conducted under the
auspices of the MEC's Office of Educational and Cultural Research and
Development (BP3K). The reviews would concentrate on assessing the degree
to which Dikmas has met its objectives under the project and on identify-
ing areas of strength and weakness. The final evaluation would serve as the



- 16 -
project completion report and would assess Dikmas' capacitv for program
implementation after an expansionary period of about a decade. During
negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would conduct
mid-term and final evaluations in accordance with terms of reference and a
schedule satisfactory to the Bank, and prompt'Ly submit such evaluations to
the Bank; a project completion report would be submitted to the Rank within
six months of the loan closing date of September 3f, IQsn [para. 6.nl1(g)J.
2.28      Applied Research.  In order to find appropriate solutions for
long-range problems, disseminate results from the proiect, and develop
innovative approaches, the project would prov-ide some TTS8250,nnf  financing
for about five studies in nonfornmal community education. These studies
would address issues such as the following:
(a)  the development of mechanisms for local financing
of nonformal education activities;
(b) the development of a national test and measurement system to
assess: (i) literacy level of learners in Paket A and other
basic education programs; and (ii) skill acquisition of
learners in the employment-oriented training and other similar
basic skill training programs;
(c)  economic and financial analysis of the basic village-level
nonformal education programs, including the institutionali-
zation of linkages between emplovment-oriented training
activities, the cooperative movement, small-scale investment,
credit agencies, and other relevant training and emplovment
schemes;
(d) the study of incentive patterns and requirements for volunteer
and other village workers of various nonformal education
extension systems, e.g. family planning cadre, nutrition and
health cadre, Dikmas tutors, and agriculture lead farmers; and
(e)  the institutional development of 1PFBs, S'Bs and RPMs as
training and materials development centers serving multi-
sectoral needs.
2.29      An administrative mechanism and criteria and procedures for
identifying and selecting priority areas of study which assign implementa-
tion responsibility to BP3K in consultation with Dikmas, were reviewed
during appraisal. During negotiations the Government provided assurances
that, by September 1 of each year, it would furnish to the Pank for review
and comment an annual program, including detailed terms of reference, for
studies to be carried out during the coming fiscal year under the project,
and thereafter implement such a program taking into account the Bank's
comments [para. 6.O1(e)(ii)].

III. COSTS AND FINANCINC
Costs
3.01      Summary of Cost.  The total cost of the project, including the
capitalized front-end fee, is estimated at USS71.6 million equivalent. The
estimated costs by project component are summarized below in Table 3.1.
Other cost tables are presented in Annex 10.
3.02      Base Cost Estimates.  Base costs refer to August 1983 prices.
Construction costs ranging from about TJS$122-270/sq m were based on recently
contracted works similar to facilities developed under the First Nonformal
Education Project. Equipment costs were derived from master equipment lists
which were reviewed during appraisal and found appropriate in scope and cost.
Furniture costs were estimated as 10% of construction costs. Costs of
learning materials and printed materials were based on experience gained under
the first phase project, ranging from about US80.30 per Paket A booklet to
US$6.80 for simulation games. Unit costs for technical assistance were
estimated at an average of about US$8,000 per staff-month for foreign
consultants (inclusive of salaries, allowances and international air fare),
and about US$900 per staff-month for local consultants. Professional fees for
architectural services were based on acceptable national practice of about 8%
of construction costs. Fellowships were calculated on average tuition fees
and subsistence costs including housing and travel allowances, as well as
administrative costs. Overseas fellowships were estimated at about TIS$2,000
per staff-month, and local fellowships at about TUS$800 equivalent per
staff-month. Recurrent costs such as consumable materials, honoraria and
travelling allowances were based on current practices in the first phase
project, which were reviewed during appraisal and found reasonable.
3.03      Customs Duties and Taxes.  Directly imported goods would be exempted
from customs duties and taxes. Taxes on other items were insignificant and
have not been included in project costs.
3.04      Contingency Allowances.  Physical contingencies (TUS84.9 million)
represent 10% and price contingencies (UTS$17.5 million), 36% of base costs.
Price contingencies were calculated on base costs plus physical contingencies
and estimated on the basis of the implementation schedule and the following
percentages: local - 20% for 1983, 15% for 1984, 11% for 1985, and 7% for
subsequent years; foreign - 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% for
subsequent years.
3.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  Based on detailed analysis of expendi-
tures of similar projects in Indonesia and particularly those of the First
Nonformal Education Project, the foreign exchange component has been
estimated as follows: (a) civil works 25%; (b) equipment 87%; (c) furniture

30%; (d) learning materials 40%; (e) foreign consultants and overseas
fellowships 957; (f) local consultants and in-country fellowships 10; (g)
honoraria 0%; (h) per diem allowances 5%; and (i) travelling allowances 50%.
The foreign exchange component, including contingencies, is estimated at
US$21.52 million, or about 30% of the total project cost.
Financing
3.06      The total project cost of TTS$71.6 million equivalent (including
the front-end fee of US$0.1 million) would be financed by a proposed loan
of US$43.0 million equivalent, covering 60% of total project costs excluding
taxes (100% of foreign and 43% of local expenditures). The Government would
finance from its annual budget the remaining costs of IUSS28.6 million (40X
of total project costs).
3.07      The financing plan and loan allocations by category of expenditure
are presented in Table 3.3.
3.08      Recurrent Costs.  To assist the Government in setting up and
operating the expanded program the Bank would finance some incremental
recurrent costs including: (a) expenses of the tutors involved in the
training of staff; (b) per diem allowances; (c) travel allowances; and (d)
consumable materials used during the project period.
3.09      Recurrent Cost Implications.  The annual recurrent costs generated
by the project when fully operational in 1989/90 would amount to Rp 5.5
billion, representing 17% of the total 1982/83 recurrent expenditures of the
Directorate for Community Education (Rp 33 billion) or 0.5% of the 1982/83
recurrent budget for the MF.C (Rp 1 trillion). These additional costs should
not constitute an unreasonable constraint on the MEC budget. The recurrent
cost per learner when the proposed new programs become fully operational
would decrease to Rp 6,257 or US$6.45 (19R3 prices), as compared to the
present cost of Rp 7,623 or TUS$7.49 (1983 prices), due to economies of scale
in program delivery.
3.10      Budget Allocations.  Budget allocations would be made available to
the project on an annual basis, in accordance with an updated Expenditure
Schedule similar to the one shown in Annex 11. In addition, related funds
required for expenditures not financed under the loan, such as taxes, land
acquisition, cost of utilities and salaries, would also be provided by the
Government in the Dikmas budget. The project would be reviewed annually by
the Bank and Dikmas Directorate and the financial allocations for the project
would be adjusted as necessary by Dikmas to ensure that project implementation
is not delayed, and operations do not suffer due to lack of funds.

Disbursements
3.11      The proposed loan of US$43.00 million would be disbursed over a
period of about six years (Annex 12). Disbursements are expected to be
completed by September 30, 1990.  Disbursements would be made against the
following categories of expenditures:



- 21 -
(a)  Civil works                              60% of total expenditures

allowances                             50% of total expenditures
3.12      Documentation of Expenditures.  Withdrawal applications would be
supported by full documentation, except for expenditures on training, per
diem allowances, travel allowances, consumable materials, and employment-
oriented fund which would be reimbursed against statements of expenditure
certified by the Project Director. Documentation for these statements would
be retained by the project unit and be available for review by the Bank
during project supervision missions. To the extent practicable, withdrawal
applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$100,000 or more, prior to
submission to the Bank.
IV. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Project Management
4.01      The existing Dikmas Directorate under the Director General for
Nonformal Education, Youth and Sports, would continue to staff and have
responsibility for overall project management (Chart 2). The Directorate
General would liaise with the chairman of BP3K and other relevant units of
the MEC on matters related to policy decisions, scope and content of program
monitoring, review, and evaluation of project activities. The BP3K would
assist in the management of the project mid-term and final evaluations in
cooperation with the appropriate Dikmas units. The organizational structure
(Chart 3) established in the First Nonformal Education Project would be
adopted in the ten new provinces under the proposed project. Day-to-day
management of project activities would be conducted at all levels, by the
national, provincial and district offices of the Dikmas organization. The
overall coordination and liaison with the Bank would be the responsibility of
the Dikmas Directorate.



- 22 -
Implementation
4.02      The project would be implemented over a period of about five years,
starting in February 1984 (Indonesian FY84/85) and ending in January 1989.
The construction, furnishing and equipping of all physical components are
scheduled to be completed by mid-1988. The technical assistance, staff
training and education program activities would continue to be supported by
the loan until the end of the Indonesian FY88/8'9 (March 31, 1989). In order
to allow sufficient time for processing of the final withdrawal applications,
the Closing Date would be scheduled for September 30, 1990. A detailed imple-
mentation schedule is shown in Annex 13. This implementation schedule and the
expenditure schedules shown in Annex 11 would serve as bases for monitoring
project implementation and would be updated annually by the Dikmas staff.
Status of Project Preparation
4.03      The project would require 27 new sites (3 BPMs and 24 SKBs) all of
which are in the process of acquisition. The Government expects to complete
all actions necessary to acquire these sites by December 31, 1983, and funding
for this is available in the 1983/4 government budget. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that acquisition of these sites would be accomplished
not later than six months prior to the scheduled start of construction at each
site, and satisfactory evidence of such acquisition would be furnished to the
Bank ipara. 6.01(h)]. Local consultants have been appointed to work on the
standardization of designs for the BPMs and SKBs. Improved preliminary
designs based on experience gained under the First Nonformal Education Project
have already been produced by the consultants and have been reviewed by the
Bank. Final designs, including a brief, accommodation schedules, construction
methods and cost estimates, were prepared by the Government and reviewed at
negotiations. Construction drawings and bid documents are scheduled for
completion by November 1983 and construction is expected to begin within three
months of loan effectiveness. Basic lists of eqjuipment and standard bid
documents for the BPMs and the SKBs have also been reviewed by the Bank.
Terms of reference for technical assistance experts and planning and
scheduling for the staff training and fellowships programs are at an advanced
state of preparation. As these are. "repeater"1 activities, no problems are
anticipated.
Procurement
4.04      A procurement profile of the major expenditure categories is pre-
sented in Table 4.1.
4.05      Civil Works.  Past experience in Indonesia has shown that contracts
for civil works do not attract foreign bidders unless they are grouped into
very large packages. Since this is not feasible under the proposed project
because of the geographical dispersion of project sites, contracts for civil
works (US$14.0 million including ccntingencies) would be awarded on the basis
of local competitive bidding following procedures which are satisfactory to
the Bank.

4.06      Equipment and Consumable Materials.  Equipment bid packages
exceeding US$100,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines and are expected
to represent about US$2.0 million in total. Equipment in bid packages below
US$100,000, and all consumable materials would be procured locally and are
expected to represent about US$3.8 million in total. Off-the-shelf items of
equipment and consumable materials not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent for
each package and aggregating to a maximum of about US$500,000 could be pur-
chased through prudent shopping on the basis of a minimum of three competi-
tive price quotations. Local manufacturers would receive a margin of
preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing imports
or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower.
4.07      Learning Materials and Books.  Most learning materials would be
printed textbooks and tutors guides produced locally, and are expected to
represent US$13.5 million in total. Printing services would be procured



- 24 -
through local competitive biddirg from private printing enterprises or
government establishments. Books and instructional printed matter would be
purchased directly from publishErs or distributors at the lowest possible
prices.
4.08      Technical Assistance. Employment of consultants would be carried
out in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
4.09      Bank Review and Approval of Procurement Decisions.  Prior approval
of the Bank would be required fcr the award of civil works contracts
exceeding US$500,000 equivalent (covering about 76% of the value and 33% of
the estimated number of contracts) and for contracts for the purchase of
equipment, consumable materials, learning materials and books exceeding
US$200,000 equivalent (covering about 78% of the value and 41% of the
estimated number of contracts).
Accounts and Audits
4.10      All agencies involved in project implementation would prepare and
maintain separate project accounts in accordance with sound accounting
practices. Accounts and documentation supporting the statements of expendi-
ture would be maintained separately and would. be readily available centrally
for review by visiting Bank missions. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that: (a) accounts, statements of expenditure, and
financial statements for each fiscal year would be prepared and audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (b) certified copies of
the audited accounts and financial statements, for each fiscal year,
together with the auditor's report would be furnished to the Bank as soon as
available, but not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year
(para. 6.02 (i)).
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      Benefits.  In expanding and strengthening Dikmas nonformal educa-
tion programs the project would )rovide basic education and employment-
oriented skill training to about 800,000 Indonesian illiterates and school
dropouts in 17 provinces between 1984 and 1989. The educational opportu-
nities provided would reach aboult 10% of the 7-44 year old out-of-school
population over the next five-year plan. In line with the Government's
stress on poverty alleviation and "spreading the fruits of development", the
project is targeted to serve the poorest segments of the population.
5.02      In the long term, the project is expected to: (a) increase literacy
levels and promote access to primary school equivalency for those desiring
to re-enter the formal school system at the secondary level; (b) provide
village-level skill.training, direct employment and increased incomes to the
poorer segments of the population; and (c) improve the effectiveness of and
increase receptivity to government services and programs such as health,
nutrition, family planning and agricultural extension.



- 25 -
5.03      Risks.  The benefits expected from the project depend largely on
the competence and commitment of the Dikmas staff especially the tutors and
monitors working directly with learners. To minimize the risk of poor
quality staff the project provides strong staff support, especially to lower
level staff, in the form of increased training, development of relevant
learning materials, and improved supervision, monitoring and evaluation. In
addition, studies would be conducted under the project to analyze incentive
requirements of village level extension cadre and to explore alternative
means of generating local financial support for nonformal education
activities.
5.04      There is also a possibility of misallocation of resources,
especially from the employment-oriented training funds, to members of the
village who are not necessarily in the greatest need of such resources and
training. Control would be exercised by a strengthened monitoring system at
the village level and by applying stringent criteria, developed in
consultation with the Bank, for selecting learning groups to be funded, based
upon lessons drawn from the pilot component in the First Nonformal Fducation
Project.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RFCOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations the Government provided assurances that it
