                               Extension of Closing Date

     PHILIPPINES – SECOND MINDANAO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                               P084967
                            LOAN PH-7440

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.     The Borrower is requesting that the closing date for the Philippines – Second
Mindanao Rural Development Project (MRDP2), Loan PH-7440 be extended from
December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2014. This restructuring proposes only a time
extension and no other changes are being sought.

2.      The Project is in a good position to achieve its development objectives. The mid-
term outcome targets were estimated to have been exceeded. For instance, the goal of
increasing the household incomes of the target beneficiaries by 7% over the baseline by
mid-term was estimated to have been surpassed, already reaching around 16%. Thus, for
the Project Development Objective (PDO) 1 on “improving the livelihood opportunities
of targeted communities?, the project is currently performing better than expected. The
mainstreaming of MRDP 2 reforms in line with PDO 2 (institutionalizing a decentralized
system for agriculture and fisheries service delivery that promotes participation,
transparency and accountability) is also well under way. The continuing progress in the
pilot-testing of the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) Harmonized Interim Operations
Manual for Local Government Unit (LGU) engagement, and the support provided by the
project to the DA Planning Service’s initiative to better integrate Local Development
Plans (LDPs) in Regional Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plans (RAFMPs) are
expected to be effective instruments for the institutionalization of the target reforms.

3.      Implementation progress, in terms of both physical and financial
accomplishments, continued to accelerate and is poised to further improve. The recent 8th
World Bank Implementation Support Mission for MRDP 2 (July 31 to August 16, 2012)
observed that physical accomplishment is better than the best-case scenario projection for
the review period. The physical accomplishment of the rural infrastructure (RI)
component of the project reached 34.1% during the mission, a remarkable 15.5
percentage point increase over a six-month period. It is, therefore, highly likely that the
end-2012 physical accomplishment target of 50% will be met. Meanwhile, disbursements
reached 41.2% during the mission, posting a hefty 11.2 percentage point increase over the
past 6 months. This favorable trend in project performance is expected to continue due to
the progress achieved in procurement. For RI, there have been dramatic advances to the
procurement stage so that only 3 subprojects worth PhP43 million (US$1 million) remain
in the Feasibility Study/Detailed Engineering stage. As of August 2012, RI subprojects
worth about PhP1.6 billion (US$39 million) have been awarded. There has been
considerable progress in the implementation of the Community Fund for Agriculture
Development (CFAD) and Natural Resource Management (NRM) subprojects for
livelihood and sustainable resource management and conservation.

4.       Project implementation progress continues to accelerate and has been rated
satisfactory for the past year. Virtually all project funds are fully obligated or committed
to specific subprojects. As of this date, a total of PhP3.79 billion (US$92.39 million)
worth of rural infrastructure are currently under various stages of contract
implementation. Meanwhile, about 96% of the PhP1.3 billion (US$31.7 million) CFAD
funds have already been obligated or have been issued Certificate of Availability of
Funds (CAF) by end- June 2012.

5.       It has been estimated that a 2-year extension of the closing date is necessary to
fully complete and disburse all remaining sub-projects primarily to make up for the 18-
month implementation hiatus brought about by the re-examination of the National
Government-Local Government Unit cost sharing policy made by the Oversight Agencies
the at the start of the project. An action plan has been prepared by the Department of
Agriculture to complete the project by end-2014 and has been reviewed and found
adequate by the Bank. There are no outstanding audit reports and interim financial reports
for the project.

6.     This will be the first extension of the project.
