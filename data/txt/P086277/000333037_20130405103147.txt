1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal for the Secondary and Local Road Project (SLRP), in early 2004,
Georgia was still recovering from the economic shocks caused by disintegration of the
Former Soviet Union and the subsequent civil war. The country also suffered the effects
of two years of sustained drought and an earthquake. Despite these shocks, there were
periods of strong economic performance, primarily reflecting the initiative of the private
sector in taking advantage of emerging opportunities. However, the country still showed
its heavy reliance on agriculture, which provided 56% of employment and accounted for
18% of GDP in 2002. An important feature of Georgia’s economy was trading with its
neighbors (both transit and bilateral), totaling $2 billion in 2002, which was high in
relation to its GDP of $3.3 billion in the same year. The population at this time was
around 5 million with 40 percent living in the rural areas. The incidence of extreme
poverty in Georgia was around 11 percent, but exceeded 30 percent in many rural areas.
Official per capita GDP in was $660 at the time of appraisal.

In 2002, the road network in Georgia consisted of 1,474 kilometers of main roads with
about 70 per cent in good to fair condition; 3,392 kilometers of secondary roads of which
over 60 percent were in poor condition and needed rehabilitation; and 15,429 kilometers
of local roads which were, on average, in very poor condition. The condition of the
secondary and local road network reflected the severe reduction in resources allocated to
road maintenance. Despite the existence of a Road Fund, revenues were estimated to be
about a third of what was needed for maintenance; only a fraction of this was allocated to
the rural road network. The poor road quality was estimated to raise transport costs by
28-56%, deterring transport operators from using rural road due to excessive damage to
their vehicles.

Prior to SLRP, Bank operations in the Transport sector had focused primarily on the main
highway networks because of their importance for trade and transit, and on institutional
strengthening of the Roads Department (RD). However, the SLRP focused on
rehabilitating important sections of the rural network, while improving its sustainability
and road safety in tandem. This was important both to spur agricultural output, and to
make various social services more accessible to the rural poor.

Although rehabilitation of the extensive rural network was a major challenge, a bigger
challenge was the transformation of a centralized, institutional structure in the road sector
to one more responsive to local needs and to the demands of a market economy. There
had been previous attempts by the Government to modernize the Ministry of Transport
and Communications using a Bank Learning and Innovation Credit (LIC). While some
progress on institutional issues had been achieved, many issues remained unresolved. The
then reliance on inefficient and costly Soviet era design and construction standards was
not economically viable, exacerbating the maintenance problem. Furthermore, the lack of
a framework for the involvement of local communities in the planning and development

                                             1
of roads meant that the needs of road users were not aligned with the road planning
decision-making process.

The original Project supported the priorities of the Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Program (EDPRP) of Georgia, June 2003 and the Bank’s assistance strategy
for Georgia through: support for sustainable growth of the rural economy; improving
expenditure management through reducing costs and better programming of available
resources in the roads sector; and strengthening institutional capacity and governance
through introduction of modem road management systems and participatory mechanisms
for road sector programs at the local level. More specifically, the project supported
broad-based growth through a pilot program for rural roads, which prepared the ground
for a more extensive, and more cost effective, program to improve rural access. The
resulting improvements in access were expected to benefit producers through reductions
in the cost of inputs and increases in farm gate prices for outputs. Expenditure
management was expected to improve as a result of multi-year plans and cost-effective
designs. Road management systems for engineering-economic prioritization of projects
combined with community participation in the planning of local road expenditures was
expected to improve road programming and budgeting and also serve monitoring to
ensure that monies are well spent. The Project was designed to institute these
arrangements as a permanent feature of the annual planning cycle in the road sector.

The rationale for the World Bank’s involvement in the SLRP were the following: (i) the
Bank was uniquely placed to help the Government and RDMID gain from experience in
other countries experiencing similar challenges (in Europe and the FSU, and also in Latin
America and Asia) in terms of community participation, innovative technologies, and
appropriate design standards for the secondary and local road network, which contributed
to the advancement of the Government’s objectives for the sector; (ii) improvements in
access for rural areas, where many of Georgia’s poor resided, was particularly suited to
the Bank’s involvement in view of its special commitment to, and extensive experience in
addressing poverty issues; and (iii) the Bank had broad experience in Georgia’s transport
sector. The trust that had resulted from this long involvement meant that the Bank was in
a good position to provide substantive assistance to the Government and RDMID for the
needed institutional reforms in the sector.

The rational for agreeing to the Government’s request for additional financing to
rehabilitate an additional 450 km of secondary and local roads were stated as (i) the
original project was well performing with technical documents for about 65% of the
roads proposed for rehabilitation under the additional financing already prepared under
the original SLRP or state budget thus ensuring fast commencement of implementation;
(ii) increasing employment opportunities and laying the ground work for improved
economic productivity in the future.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The main objective of the proposed Project were to: (a) improve the economic and social
well-being of the rural population in selected areas through upgrading of their secondary
and local road networks; (b) improve the effectiveness of Road Department of the
Ministry of Infrastructure to maintain a cost effective and sustainable secondary and local
road network; and (c) improve the effectiveness of Road Department of the Ministry of
Infrastructure and Development in its interaction with local communities and its
responsiveness to local needs. Assessment of the Project was designed to be undertaken
using the following set of quantitative and qualitative indicators:

    a. Linked to the first PDO: (i) reduction in transport cost and (ii) increases in off-
       farm employment income. 1
    b. Linked to the second PDO: (i) reductions in the unit cost of road works; and (ii)
       annual expenditures on secondary and local road maintenance.
    c. Linked to the third PDO: Annual publication of road condition, expenditure and
       future program information; and (ii) preparation of a proposal for annual local
       road improvements by each Road Management Committee 2

Not explicitly linked to a PDO but related to the third PDO was statements that the
Project would assist the RDMID establish regional offices to allow closer linkages with
communities, and better monitoring of implementation.

It is noted that the results framework in the PAD did not include the indicators linked to
the first PDO. This was corrected in the course of the restructuring related to the
Additional Financing.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The revised PDO at the time of the Additional Financing which involved a Level 1
restructuring of the Project were to: (i) upgrade and rehabilitate the secondary and local
roads networks; and (ii) improve 3 Roads Department of the Ministry of Regional
Development and Infrastructures’ and local governments’ capacity to manage the road
network in a cost effective and sustainable manner. To better measure the revised PDO
and fully capture the impact of the rehabilitated roads and their contribution to poverty
alleviation within the Project, two new outcome indicators and three new intermediate
indicators were added to the results framework. The additional outcome indicators were
(i) travel time improvement over current situation on targeted road sections; and (ii)


1
  The off-farm employment to be measured was those created from the execution of civil works under the
project.
2
  The composition of the RMC provided opportunity for representatives of the RDMID to interact with the
local governments and communities.

  This is as per the supplemental paper no 2 for the AF.

                                                  3
number of person-months of jobs created (Bank estimates). The three new intermediate
indicators were: (i) guidebook produced and provided to Local governments; and (iii)
workshop for local governments conducted; and (iii) 730 km of roads designed. The latter
indicator was a useful addition as it provided a more measurable indicator for component
3 compared with that stated in the appraisal results framework. Increases in the scope of
planned road rehabilitation with the additional financing were reflected by adjustments to
relevant targets for the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

There was no specific mention of the ‘primary target groups’ or ‘beneficiaries’ in the
PAD. However, the Project objectives and key indicators suggests that the primary
beneficiaries of the SLRP would be the rural communities living in the vicinity of the
road improvements. Socio-economic surveys 4 carried out during Project preparation had
suggested that road improvements would have a positive impact on the economic and
social well-being of rural Georgia. The reduction in transport costs were expected to
increase the competitiveness of local produce, improve access to social services, i.e.
schools and medical facilities, and to off-farm employment opportunities. The safety of
road users and pedestrians were also expected to improve as a result of the road
improvements. In addition, tourism was expected to improve in rural areas, which has
historically been an important sector of the Georgian economy.

From the PAD, the secondary beneficiaries of the Project were expected to be the Road
Department of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (RDMID). The
institutional component of the Project was expected to improve RDMID’s management
capacity of the secondary and local road network; through better funding and
organization of road maintenance and rehabilitation, and by introducing more cost-
effective contracting mechanisms. In addition, the Project was expected to improve
RDMID’s interaction with communities and its responsiveness to local needs, through
well-functioning participatory mechanisms.

Activities included under the additional financing made more direct the benefits of the
local governments from the Project in the form of the production of guidebooks for the
maintenance of local roads and conduct of a workshop to explain their use to the local
governments. These were intended to improve the local governments’ knowledge of good
practice in the preparation and delivery of road maintenance works.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Rehabilitation of approximately 500 to 750 kilometers of paved
secondary and local roads, including between 150 to 250 kilometers of local roads
(US$ 22.54 million).

Component 2: Strengthening the capacity of road sector institutions by improving
engineering standards and data collection capabilities, establishing between four and six
regional offices for network and works monitoring, development and implementation of
regional road maintenance plans, improved interactions with local communities, and
traffic safety enhancements (US$2.40 million); and

Component 3: Design and supervision of the road works and to produce reports for the
Mid-Term Review to evaluate the first year program (US$2.50 million).

It was also envisaged to provide trust fund support for the training of traffic police,
through a twinning arrangement in traffic safety enforcement, crash data recording and
analysis, and traffic police work in general. Required equipment was to be acquired under
component (2) above.

With the initial Project nearing completion, a decision was taken to expand its scope
through an Additional Financing operation. The Additional Financing involved a Level 1
restructuring of the Project. While the Project components remained unchanged,
additional civil works and technical assistance (TA) activities were added.

1.6 Revised Components

The Additional Financing and restructuring resulted in the following revised components
for the Project:

Component 1: Rehabilitating about 700 kilometers of secondary and local roads, include
some 565 km of secondary and 135 km of local roads in six regions throughout Georgia.

Component 2: Strengthening the Capacity of Road Sector Institutions: (a) strengthening
the capacity of RDMRDI and its six regional offices in management and maintenance of
the secondary road network through the provision of: (i) consultants’ services for data
collection; (ii) computer equipment, laboratory, equipment, vehicles and office furniture;
and (iii) training (b) Strengthening the capacity of local government units in management
and maintenance of local road network through: (i) the provision of consultants’ services
for assessing needs and resources of the local governments for roads maintenance and for
designing a local road management and maintenance resource manual; and (ii)
conducting workshops for local governments on local road management and
maintenance; and (c) Provision of consultants’ services for preparing project audits.

Component 3: Designing and Supervising Road Rehabilitation: Designing about 150
kilometers of road rehabilitation and supervising approximately 450 kilometers of road
rehabilitation works, through the provision of consultants’ services.

1.7 Other significant changes

The design of the Project did not change during implementation but the scope did with
opportunities taken to increase the responsiveness of the Project to changing policy and

                                            5
institutional environments by making more explicit the assistance under the Project to the
RDMID and the local governments to increase their capacity to manage and maintain
their road network. The change in design and scope were reflected through four
restructurings of the Project as outlined in the table below.

The first restructuring 5 led to a change in the scope of component 1 to ‘rehabilitation of
about 250 km of secondary and local roads, including about 75 km of local roads,
carrying out drainage improvements and providing signage and access to adjacent
properties.’ The reduction in the original length of roads to be rehabilitated was a result
of agreement to increase the standard of rehabilitation to be carried out relative to those
agreed at appraisal.

The second restructuring was linked to an additional financing of US$70 million to allow
for the rehabilitation of an additional 450 km of roads comprising about 390 km of

secondary roads and 60 km of local roads. 6 This increased the target length of roads to be
rehabilitated under component 1 of the Project to approximately 565km and 135 km for
secondary and local roads respectively7. Regarding component 2, two new activities were
added (i) guidebook produced and provided to local governments and (ii) workshop for
local government conducted under component 2 while component 3 saw an increase in
the consulting services due to an increase in the length of roads to be designed as 730 km
and supervised. The PDO for the Project was revised as part of the restructuring (see 1.3).
To allow the additional civil works and TA activities to be undertaken, the original
closing date of the Project was extended by 24 months from October 31, 2009 to October
31, 2011. The additional financing was approved by the Board of Directors on March 19,
2009. 8

The third restructuring was a level 2 restructuring to increase the lengths of roads to be
rehabilitated under component 1 from 450 km to between 590 to 630 km, increase the
length of roads being designed and supervised under component 3 from 150 km to 250
km and from 450 km to 590 to 630 km respectively. This restructuring was approved on
February 25, 2010.

The fourth and final restructuring was also a level 2 and was approved on October 28,
2011. Its purpose was to extend the closing date of the project from October 31, 2011 to
June 30, 2012 to allow completion of two civil works contracts which had experienced
some delay.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis. Project preparation included a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges facing the road sector at the time of appraisal and extensive dialogues with the
Government to assist it define a responsive strategy 9. These analyses led Government to
two important conclusions: (i) the transit movement east to west through Georgia is
important to Georgia’s economy and its better integration to the world economy; and (ii)
the condition of the road network beyond the national highway was poor reflecting
historically inadequate maintenance expenditures 10 and was a major impediment to
development, particularly for the rural economy. Most critical was funding of the
maintenance of secondary and local roads, essential for access to both to the primary

  In the signed Loan Agreement (LN 7671-GE) dated February 25, 2010 the target length was stated as
between 590 to 630 km. These figures are the total length of roads to be rehabilitated while the figures
stated in the PAD are the additional length to be rehabilitated under the additional financing.

  The studies included ‘Transport Sector Review of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia’, ECSIE, World
Bank, 2002 and ‘Trade and Transport Facilitation in the South Caucasus – A Georgia Policy Note- ECSIE,
World Bank, 2003.’
10
   In 2002, the sector review had revealed maintenance expenditure to be about US$600 per kilometer
against a need of between US$4,000 to US$6,000.

network and to markets and social services for communities in the more remote areas.
The poor condition of the secondary and local roads was adjudged to be contributing to
increased incidence of both relative and extreme poverty. A third strand of findings from
the background analysis related to the challenge to transform the centralized institutional
and administrative structures of Government to make them more responsive to the
demands of a market economy and to local needs. Quite importantly, it indicated a need
for continued efforts to move road design and construction practices away from the old
Soviet era methods and to establish a framework for involving local communities in the
development and upkeep of their roads.

The scale of the problem suggested by the background analysis led the Project to be seen
as a pilot (p18 of PAD). It was to be the first of a potential series of interventions directed
at: (i) improving the condition of the extensive secondary and local roads network of
Georgia; (ii) introducing methods and practices that would strengthen the institutional
framework for managing the secondary and local roads of Georgia; and (iii) technical
assistance to improve practices relating to the design and supervision of works. Allied to
these elements was a need to increase the expenditure on maintenance while at the same
time reducing the unit cost of road maintenance. Road safety was also planned to be
improved through trust fund resources. Given the extent of the deterioration of the
secondary and local roads, and the scale of institutional transformation needed at the level
of the RDMID and Government to improve efficiency of road sector management and
financing, it was appropriate for the Project to be positioned as the first phase of a series
of interventions needed to address the problem. The view of the Bank team was that a
low cost rehabilitation approach was best as this would allow coverage of more
kilometers of roads within available funding envelope. While not fully convinced on the
correctness of this approach due to the more frequent maintenance interventions that
would be required, the RDMID nevertheless accepted the Bank position. Selection of
roads included in the Project involved the selection first of the secondary roads followed
by selection of the local roads for repair based on the zone of influence of the secondary
roads. This approach optimized connectivity of the local communities to markets. Project
preparation included three workshops for local firms doing the engineering design works
on environmental issues.

Assessment of Project design. The Project design was satisfactory from many
standpoints. It was clearly focused on the priority need of the Government to improve the
secondary and local roads network and its transformational agenda of improving
efficiency of service delivery and responsiveness to the needs of the rural poor. It was
satisfactory also because it recognized the likely need for change to the design perhaps in
scope by building into the mid-term review an explicit review of the Project scope and
design. Preparation for the mid-term review benefited from there being a budget in the
Project for the preparation of a mid-term review report which provided a good diagnostic
of implementation progress and lessons learned. Two factors influenced the approach to
capacity building activities.

The first, aimed at improving methods and practices by including development of new
design and maintenance standards and activities to improve design capacity of the

                                              8
emerging private sector design firms. A second aimed at improving the basis for and
nature of decision-making on planned maintenance investments through preparation of 5-
year rolling plans and participatory approaches involving local governments and
communities. Improving monitoring and evaluation was facilitated by the establishment
of an inventory of local roads. Linking outputs to specific policy objective was a good
feature of the design as it allowed the Government to better assess the direct impact of the
Project on its key policy objective, reducing poverty. While the design was inherently
simple, it did require the procurement of many civil and consulting services which was
quite a burden on RDMID during implementation. In hindsight, the technical assistance
could have included a specialist to help with the design and implementation of the
participatory processes with the local governments and communities. This said, the
design of the required participatory approach was very well detailed in the PAD.

Three key lessons from previous projects were reflected in the design of the Project. The first
was that while there was a viable civil works industry in Georgia, for both design and
construction, the absence of competition and published, predictable work programming had
limited its potential. This was responded to in the Project design by introducing competition
among local firms in the design of works under the Project with tenders for multiyear road
programs prepared and published to make future levels of construction activity more
predictable. The second lesson was RDMID’s lack of a regional organization which limited
its ability to supervise and monitor works closely. The Project therefore provided for the
re-establishment of a regional structure and decentralized arrangement for managing
maintenance works. This was expected to not only permit better local knowledge by RDMID
but also voice by local governments and communities in the programming of road
improvements. Third, technical assistance in the ongoing project had introduced new road
structural standards and material specifications which should lead to increased road durability
and service life. Resistance had however been experienced to the introduction of new
geometric standards (e.g. road width). To address this issue, the Project included development
of more appropriate geometric standards through a design competition. This approach was a
useful innovation as it allowed areas for possible cost savings to emerge from the peer review
process and thus confirm the need for revision of the existing standards and practices.

The Project was designed to avoid the triggering of any land acquisition. Consultation
meetings with community members and with Raion government and village council
officials" were conducted to explore their interest in participating in the proposed Road
Management Committees (RMCs), and to understand the social impacts of road
programs. 11 Some of the issues raised at the meetings included (i) poor condition of the
roads which made difficult access to schools, markets, etc; (ii) while some equipment and
skilled labor to fix roads at the local level were available, funding was not available to
pay for labor, fuel, repairs, and unemployed was available; (iii) skilled technicians were
available and ready to work for 10 Lari a day with helpers costing less; (iv) villagers
could contribute very little financially to meeting the cost of road maintenance; and (v)
Raion Government could contribute funds from annual budget allocation. The result of

 The outcome of these consultations and resultant recommendations were documented in Annex 10 of the
PAD.

                                                 9
these meetings demonstrated the importance of understanding community interests and
mobilizing communities along shared interests. The Project design therefore provided for
Regional Coordinators to organize similar meetings annually, and help communities’
articulate priorities for road improvements. The result of such meetings were then to be
communicated to the RMCs, with the final program agreed between the RMC and
RDMlD presented for adoption at a Raion Transport meeting organized each year by the
RMCs. The Project design also included how the RMCs would monitor Project impacts.
The design could have been improved by the inclusion of a TA to help with
implementation of this sub-component.

Government commitment. Perhaps the most important evidence of the Government’s
commitment was its recognition of the need for change in the approach to the planning
and executions of maintenance activities to not only make them more cost effective but
within a more participatory framework which reinforced collaboration between central
and local governments and communities. This position of Government encouraged the
RDMID to accept responsibility to assist under the Project the addressing of the problems
of local roads for which it did not have direct responsibility. This approach and other key
elements were contained in a Letter of Road Sector Policy provided by the Government
as one of the conditions of project effectiveness. Additional evidence was the
Government’s readiness to commit to increase expenditure on maintenance of secondary
and local roads on an annual basis during the Project period from 20 million GEL in 2005
to 60 million GEL by 2008. This helped to significantly increase the length of roads
eventually rehabilitated under the Project. The government also displayed a willingness
to increase its financial contribution to the Project as the economy improved and the Lari
appreciated.

Risks and mitigation. The Project design risks were described under the context of
‘sustainability’ of the Project and assessment of ‘critical risks and possible controversial
aspects. In relation to sustainability, the principal risk identified related to inadequacies or
uncertainties regarding availability of funds for continued maintenance as this would
affect the condition of the network as it becomes difficult to plan and commit
maintenance programs in a timely manner. It was also considered as likely to affect the
construction industry’s viability, ability to acquire equipment and maintain financial
capacity to undertake contracts. This risk was said to be mitigated by covenants requiring
agreed level of annual increases in the funding of maintenance. However, no such
covenants were among the covenants included in the Project design. There was however
an outcome indicator which specified a level of increase in the annual expenditure on
road maintenance over the Project implementation period. A second risk associated with
the sustainability of the Project related to institutional development with possible
resistance foreseen to the restructuring of the RDMID from mid to lower level
management staff. While mitigation was expected to come from the Government’s strong
commitment to restructuring the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (MID), the
need was foreseen for strong supervision by TRRC and close monitoring of
implementation to overcome obstacles that could arise from such resistance. During
implementation, the little resistance experienced was well dealt with by the incorporated
mitigation action. This was in part because the reforms became more driven by the needs

                                              10
for implementation of projects relating to the upgrading of the East-West highway
between Tbilisi and the Rikoti Tunnel for which the MID had a strong commitment to
expedite.

The most critical risk identified by the team was the inadequacy of the road budget for
project counterpart financing and for maintenance of the network. This was designed to
be mitigated through adoption of increased road user charges or increased road budget
allocation. In the event, the Government well exceeded the budget it was to allocate for
maintenance secondary and local roads. The participatory arrangements embodied in the
design was also seen as entailing some risks as they could raise expectations among local
communities’ which may not be able to be met with the available financial resources. To
mitigate, it was recognized that care would be needed to ensure that communities were
made aware of the financial constraints. A factor not specifically identified as a risk was
the possible negative impact on project implementation of lack of investment by private
firms in road works technology and the absence of a competitive road works industry but
contributed to by the lack of a predictable roads program. During implementation, the
designs submitted and approved were of higher standard than assumed at appraisal
leading to higher bid prices. This had the impact of reducing the length of roads that
could be rehabilitated under the Project and led to the first restructuring of the Project to
reduce the target length of roads to be rehabilitated from ‘approximately 500 to 700 km’
to ‘about 250 km’.

Environmental Safeguards. Environmental Assessments (EAs) were prepared for the
work included in the first year of the Project. EAs were then to be prepared for all
subsequent works under the Project in line with the provisions of the Environmental
Management Framework (EMF) 12. The EAs also included Environmental Management
Plans (EMPs) that detailed mitigation and monitoring activities. An EMF was also
prepared for the Project which provided policy frameworks for chance finds and
specifications of mitigation issues to be included in construction contracts. The
monitoring responsibilities of the project manager serving as supervising engineers were
also included. Such social issues as access to farmland and private residences or access to
utilities were to be addressed and their cost included in the cost of rehabilitation.
Necessary clearances and agreements on these environment documents were obtained
from the Georgian Ministry of the Environment (MoE).

Social safeguards. The Project was designed to avoid the triggering of any land
acquisition. It therefore did not provide for the preparation of Resettlement Management
Frameworks (RMF) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAP). During implementation, one of
the contractors however saw the need to acquire a small amount of land. Upon
assessment by the Bank Social Safeguards specialist, the amount of land involved was
adjudged not significant enough to have triggered land acquisition. It is noted that the
second SLRP project triggered the preparation of RMF and RAPs to provide flexibility in
dealing with unexpected need for land acquisition during implementation.



12
     These site-specific EAs were carried out as required.

                                                       11
Consultation meetings with community members and with Raion government and village
council officials" were conducted to explore their interest in participating in the proposed
Road Management Committees (RMCs), and to understand the social impacts of road
programs. 13 Some of the issues raised at the meetings included (i) poor condition of the
roads is a major problem - difficult to access schools, markets, etc; (ii) while some
equipment and skilled labor to fix roads at the local level were available, funding was not
available to pay for labor, fuel, repairs, and unemployed was available; (iii) skilled
technicians were available are ready to work for 10 Lari a day with helpers costing less;
(iv) villagers could contribute very little financially to meeting the cost of road
maintenance; and (v) Raion Government 14 could contribute funds from annual budget
allocation. The result of these meetings demonstrated the importance of understanding
community interests and mobilizing communities along shared interests. The Project
design therefore provided for Regional Coordinators to organize similar meetings
annually, and help communities’ articulate priorities for road improvements. The result of
such meetings were then to be communicated to the RMCs, with the final program agreed
between the RMC and RDMlD presented for adoption at a Raion Transport meeting
organized each year by the RMCs. The Project design also included how the RMCs
would monitor Project impacts.

Fiduciary. Compliance with fiduciary requirements was satisfactory. A procurement
assessment of RDMID and TRRC (acting as the PIU) was conducted and both entities
were found qualified for the activity. The procurement risk was however rated as High in
view of the conclusions of the June 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR) and the country environment. This rating impacted the thresholds for prior and
post review as well as the periodicity of the procurement supervision missions established
for the Project. A plan to address perceived procurement risks was agreed with RDMID
and TRRC. The financial management assessment found TRRC as having in place
acceptable financial management arrangements sufficient to meet Bank requirements in
respect of the quality of accounting, reporting and internal controls system and also in
respect of the audit arrangements. During implementation, the system in place worked
quite smoothly to the extent that the RDMID decided that even activities financed from
the national budget would be procured using the Bank procurement system.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation efficiency. Implementation arrangements remained the same throughout
Project implementation except for a change in the role of TRRC upon creation of the
Foreign Projects Unit (FPU). The FPU was created to undertake all procurement
activities and provide technical support to RDMID units responsible for implementing all
externally financed activities of the RDMID. In this arrangement, the role of TRRC was
reduced to financial management and monitoring and evaluation. A commendable

   The outcome of these consultations and resultant recommendations were documented in Annex 10 of the
PAD.
14
   Decentralization carried out in 2006 led to the abolition of Raion level of government. Therefore, the
project requirement for this institution to coordinate local transport issues was excluded from the project.

                                                    12
feature of implementation was the degree of proactivity and between the Bank team and
RDMID which led to timely addressing of issues as they emerged. The Project was
restructured four times. The first restructuring involved increasing of the standards to
which project roads would be rehabilitated. During appraisal, the Bank team had argued
for relatively low standard of rehabilitation with the RDMID arguing for a higher
standard. During implementation, it was found that roads rehabilitated to the Bank
suggested standards soon deteriorated after rehabilitation thus requiring maintenance
interventions. This experience led the Bank team to agree that the roads be rehabilitated
to higher standard. Though this would increase the cost of rehabilitation of each road
section, government was willing to increase its contribution to the Project as the economy
improved and the Lari appreciated and the government budget could accommodate a
greater level of public expenditure. The mid-term review was used to correctly assess
progress with implementation and the need for revisions to the Project. 15 The main
findings of the review were that (i) capacity building and technical assistance activities
were on track and already producing substantive results with the Government deciding
that road network financed under the Budget would adopt the same modern principles
being applied under the Project including use of Bank procurement methods and bidding
documents; (ii) budget earmarked for road maintenance was by then three times what was
expected at appraisal. This should facilitate planned capacity building of the construction
and contribute to overall project sustainability; and (iii) need seen to change the original
low cost interventions which were agreed to have being set too low. This implied that
lower kilometers of roads would be completed under the Project.

Restructuring of the Project was carried out four times to principally to change the length
of roads to be rehabilitated under the Project, adjust the results frameworks to revise
targets and add new ones to better capture the poverty impact of the project. A last
restructuring led to extension of the closing date to allow two road sections tendered late
to be completed.

Quality of works. This was variable especially for road sections passing through urban
centers with signing, access connections to abutting properties, lack of attention to
sidewalks and drainage areas of particular concern. This was attributed to inadequate
provision for these items in the designs: it was later agreed that they could be financed
from contingencies under the contracts. There were also instances of loss of seal on some
paved sections. These shortfalls in quality were also in part due to inadequate supervision
of the works by the supervision consultants and infrequent monitoring by the RDMID of
the performance of the consultants and contractors. Significant cost savings arose from
the appreciation of GEL, the 2008 economic crisis which led to aggressive bidding by
contractors. Units costs of roads rehabilitated varied from GEL 81,000 to 308,000 for
local roads and from GEL 111, 000 to 467,000 for secondary. This led the Bank team to
recommend that the RDMID set up a cost monitoring system and also to establish an
inventory of local roads.



15
  Annex 2 to the aide memoire of the July 2006 mission is a good practice on planning of mid-term
reviews which is worthy of being widely shared.

                                               13
Implementation delays. The Project did not experience any significant delays. Most
activities of the original Project were completed by July 2008 with disbursement at 95%
and closing foreseen by end of year. In general, implementation progress was good. By
the mid-term review, the early closing of the Project was foreseen by April 2008 and
discussions on a possible new project were initiated. While there was a closing date
extension for the Additional Financing, this was to allow completion of two on-going
contracts the signing of which had been delayed and thus having difficulties being
completed within the Project closing date: without extension of the closing date the
burden for payments not made under the Project would have fallen on the government.

In parallel with the Project, the RDMID also had to implement three other Bank
operations related to the upgrading of the E60 road corridor. This additional
responsibility at times stretched the capacity of the RDMID which adversely impacted its
ability to effectively supervise the Project.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The indicators and targets for results monitoring were in general well linked with
Project design and allowed good monitoring of the outputs of the components. The output
indicators captured the key activities under the Project while the outcome indicators
reflected the outcomes carrying out of the activities would have. An exception was the
definition of the indicator for capturing the outputs from component 3. At appraisal, the
indicator was defined as ‘same as components 1 and 2’ which was not the case. This was
corrected with the second restructuring when specific measurable targets were set for the
two activities under this component. The Project ‘outcome’ indicators were essentially
‘output’ indicators. During the restructuring for the AF, this was corrected by defining
two indicators which allowed the capture of the outcome of the road rehabilitation
activities. The targets were realistic and were well linked to specific activities under the
Project. By the MTR, the Project was well on its way to meeting its targets despite delays
experienced early in implementation. There were no specific indicators relating to
implementation of the Letter of Sector Policy. This said, one of the main issues of course
was adequate funding of maintenance for which there was an indicator to capture
increases over the Project period.

Implementation. Project monitoring and evaluation including preparation of progress
reports were carried out regularly, although the latter at times experienced delays. The
targets were timely adjusted during implementation to reflect progress being made,
changes in approach to the road rehabilitation and increase in the contribution of the
Government to the Project which allowed an increase in the scope of planned road
rehabilitation.

Utilization. Monitoring reports were used to measure Project progress as evidenced in
comments by the Bank team in the Aide memoires and ISRs e.g. the early signaling of
the need to adjust the target for roads rehabilitated as a result of slow implementation
progress. It is noticed in the ISR that the indicator ‘annual reports published’ stated at

                                            14
appraisal as an outcome indicator were sometimes recorded in the ISR as an intermediate
outcome indicator thus creating confusion: the final ISR correctly reflected it as an
outcome indicator. It is noted however that the indicators of the original project were not
well documented in the ISR and this adversely affected their utilization. This lapse was
corrected when the PDO was revised during the second restructuring.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental safeguards. The Project triggered Bank safeguards policies
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). An EMF was prepared during appraisal was
later used to prepare full environmental assessment with specific EMP completed for
each road design package. Throughout implementation, the Project was in compliance
with the World Bank’s environmental policy. Insufficiency of signing of work sites and
disposal of waste from road sides were shortfalls noted during safeguard supervision
missions. The environmental reports to be submitted by the works supervision
consultants were not always well prepared or timely submitted. Proactive interventions
by the Bank team finally led to a correction of the situation.

Social safeguards. The participatory approach to the selection of local roads to be
rehabilitated was implemented with relative success. This is particularly so after the
opening of the Regional Offices which facilitated regular contacts between the RDMID
and the local government. These offices however had differing capacity with some well-
staffed as (e.g. the ones in Batumi and Katausi) while others were not so capacitated (e.g.
Sagarejo) and this affected the relative impact of the offices in facilitating the work of the
RMCs. While the road rehabilitation was not expected to trigger any land acquisition, a
minor land take did take place caused by the necessity to realign a road section lost due to
the erosion of the river bank. From review of the report prepared by the client and site
visit, the Bank’s social scientist however determined that the Bank’s Involuntary
Resettlement Policy was not triggered due to the small and singular nature of the
occurrence.

Fiduciary compliance

Procurement. Procurement under the Project was relatively well handled with the
implementing agency gaining in confidence during implementation. Comfort with and
acceptance of the merit of the Bank procurement process was the decision by the
Government to use Bank procurement methods for procurement of activities funded from
government budget. This is a commendable achievement by the Bank’s Project team as
it reflected not only the extent of the capacity built in the RDMID but also the good
relationship they had developed such that the merit of the process was clear to the
government and RDMID. During implementation, it is to be noted that the procurement
function under the Project was taken away from the TRRC into the newly created Foreign
Projects Unit (FPU) within the RDMID. The overall procurement management rating is
Satisfactory.




                                             15
Financial Management and Disbursement. Apart from a few instances of late
submission of monitoring reports and late payments, this function was discharged
credibly by the TRRC throughout implementation. The only issue was that of adoption of
eDisbursement by the TRRC which it could not do without being approved by the
government. Overall, financial management and disbursement is rated as Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The level of deterioration of the secondary and local road network was correctly seen as
requiring several operations to be fully addressed. Thus, the Project was seen as a pilot.
The AF financing of US$70 million provided and the additional investment by the
government since appraisal have led to significant improvements in the condition of the
secondary and local roads network. The percentage of secondary roads in poor condition
is now 40 instead of the appraisal figure of 61. This is a significant achievement which
however also clearly indicates the need for more interventions to improve the condition
of this section of the road network. The follow on SLRP 2 which became effective on
May 24, 2012, will rehabilitate and or improve an additional 425 kilometers of roads and
this should contribute to increasing the percentage of the secondary and local network in
good condition. Planned assistance to the RDMID under other project supported by the
Bank includes improvements to the institutional capacity of the RDMID. This should
help secure gains under the SLRP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of the PDO. The PDO as originally defined and revised remain relevant as
secondary and local roads of Georgia still require rehabilitation and improvement to
improve connectivity, economic and social wellbeing of the rural population thereby
contributing to reducing rural poverty. The institutional capacity of the RDMID still
needs strengthening given the scale of the challenges in the road sector. Quite importantly,
participatory road planning is closely linked to administrative arrangements at the at the
local government level.       New arrangements were established early in project
implementation. These are still evolving and may require the RDMID to adapt its
approaches to engaging with the local governments and communities.

Relevance of design. The secondary and local roads are the backbone of efforts to
decrease rural poverty, promote regional development and better integrate the economy at
the national level. The manuals for the design of rehabilitation and maintenance produced
under the Project have helped to institutionalize good and cost effective road designs and
maintenance approaches: the unit cost of works carried out in the latter stages of the
Project based on the newly adopted design standards were lower than those for the initial
works under the Project. The benefits of these manuals are expected to be increasingly
felt as more people gain familiarity with their use. The participatory approaches provide a
framework that the Government can use to deepen the involvement of the population in
decision making in the road sector. The potential to use road rehabilitation to create

                                            16
temporary job creation has been well demonstrated under the Project. The design
approach to these works is one that the Government can use in response to an economic
crisis such as that faced in 2008.

Relevance of implementation. Rehabilitation of roads under component 1 constituted 92
per cent of the overall Project cost. It was clearly the main focus during implementation
due to its high priority to the government. Attention given by the RDMID to the technical
assistance and design and supervision services activities could have been improved.
Capacity building activities in the form of specific training to the traffic police,
workshops for local design engineers and contractors as well as the mixing of
international and local consultants in some of the consulting services have significantly
contributed to institutional strengthening within the RDMID and its service providers
(consultants and civil works contractors) who have become more receptive to adopting
new standards and practices. The workshops to disseminate the manuals produced to
help local governments in carrying out maintenance works could have been conducted
more frequently than done given that staff changes take place within these institutions.
During implementation, some bids were found not to have been competitive with only
one or two bidders. This in part reflected the decreased competition within the domestic
construction industry as the level of activities under the Project increased. This is a
situation that has been experienced on other projects including the follow-on SLRP 2 and
needs to be addressed by both the Bank and the government. 16


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the PDO is rated as overall satisfactory.

The PDO was formally revised during the Level 1 restructuring for the Additional
Financing by Board approval as was the original Project. The project outcome has
therefore been assessed against both the original and revised PDOs with separate
outcome ratings (for original and revised PDOs) derived by weighing them in proportion
of actual disbursements at the time of and before the approval of the revised PDO in
order to arrive at the overall outcome rating. The result of this calculation is shown in the
table below.

                                                                        line’


Achievement of the original PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory based on
achievement of the project just prior to its restructuring with all its planned civil works
representing about 70 percent of project cost almost completed and a key indicator
associated with the sustenance of this investment, increase in maintenance funding
exceeded by more than four fold. However, other indicators stated at appraisal to monitor
achievement such as reduction in travel time and jobs created were not monitored in the
results framework before the restructuring of the Project involving the AF.

At the time of the revision of the PDO, progress towards achievements of the original
PDO was as follows:

       (i) Regarding the first PDO, improve the economic and social well-being of the rural
            population in selected areas through upgrading of their secondary and local road
            networks, impact was to be measured through the indicators ‘reduction in
            transport cost/time for rural communities to access markets and social services’
            and increased access to off-farm employment for the rural poor’, these two
            indicators were not included in the results framework in the ISR until after the
            PDO was revised. Thus no baseline or target figures are available to assess
            achievement.
       (ii) Regarding the second PDO ‘improve effectiveness of RDMID maintain a cost
            effective and sustainable secondary and local roads network’ achievement was to
            be measured by two indicators ‘ increases in road maintenance expenditures’ and
            reduction in RDMID’s maintenance and unit costs’. The target for the first
            indicator was GEL 60 million and achievement was GEL 280 million
            representing about fourfold over achievement. 17 For the second indicator,
            achievement for secondary and local roads respectively were GEL186,000/km
            and GEL132,000/km against targets of GEL80,000/km and GEL60,000/km.
            These achievements compare with baseline figures of GEL170,000/km and
            GEL90,000/km respectively. Thus for secondary roads, there was a regression
            between the baseline and what was achieved while there was an improvement for
            local roads.

     See ISR 10 of 09/28/2008.

                                                18
   (iii) For the third PDO, improve the effectiveness of RDMID in its interactions with
        local communities and its responsiveness to local needs, these were to be
        measured by ‘Raion level RMDs and public meetings’, ‘Raion Councils annual
        proposals for road improvements’ and ‘RDMID annual reports on road network
        condition.’ The results framework did not reflect these as PDO indicators but had
        them as intermediate outcome indicators. Taking RMCs established as a measure
        of of the first indicator, the number of RMCs was said to be still assessed but
        likely more than the target. Two annual reports had been published and a 5-year
        rolloing maintenance plan was said to be ‘underway’.
   (iv) Regarding intermediate outcome indicators, achievement was good with the
        target 175 km of secondary roads for rehabilitation said to be almost completed
        and works contracted on 85 km of local roads, above the 75 km targeted for
        rehabilitation. Four of the planned ‘four to six’ regional offices were operational
        hence the target could be said to have been achieved.

The achievement of the revised PDO is rated as satisfactory. This reflects the
achievement of the target for the PDO indicators ‘reduction in travel time improvements
over current situation on targeted road sections’, and ‘the achievement of the target for
the third PDO indicator relating to road maintenance expenditures and achievement of
eight out of the ten output indicators. At close of the Project, its achievements in relation
to the outcome indicators were as follows:

   (i) The target for the indicator ‘reduction in travel time improvements over current
           situation on targeted road sections’ was 20 percent. Achievement at closing
           was measured as 19.9 percent.
   (ii) The second outcome indicator was ‘number of person months of jobs created
           (Bank estimates)’ and had the target of 24,000 jobs being created. By project-
           end, 13,431 jobs were created. In setting the target, the assumption at
           appraisal was that labor intensive road works methods would be used to a
           significant extent. In reality:
               • Application of new, less labor intensive technology for road base (cold
                   recycling using milled material). Stating from 2009, the SLRP AF
                   rehabilitated 4 more time roads (per km basis) by cold recycling
                   technology, as compared to the SLRP (jobs created was estimated for
                   SLRP). The cold recycling methodology required much fewer workers
                   than the traditional method. The SLRP rehabilitated a total 250km of
                   roads about 40% by cold recycling. The SLRP AF rehabilitated total
                   593.4km of roads 60% by cold recycling.
               • Application of less labor intensive methods for piling and concrete
                   works. RD made example of past best practice for manual excavation
                   of piles for bridges. Manual excavation is replaced by drilling
                   machines. Also contractors used more precast structures (culverts and
                   drains) as opposed to the cast on site process.
               • Application of a more skilled work force with higher salaries.




                                             19
                 •  Indirect job creation through subcontracting was not reported. About
                    28% of total values works was subcontracted. The jobs created by
                    subcontractor was not accounted and reported.
   (iii) The third outcome indicator ‘road maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures
            (GEL) million’ had the target of increasing from GEL 20 million at the start of
            the Project to GEL 155 million at its closing. The achievement was GEL 184
            million, thus exceeding the target by about 20 percent and reflecting the strong
            commitment of the government to the Project. The fourth and final outcome
            indicator was ‘annual report published’. This report was published annually
            from 2006 to 2011 and the target can therefore be taken as achieved. It should
            however be said that the content of the reports was more a publicity brochure
            than a technical report on the performance of the government and its road
            agency. It would have been expected that over the six years of its publication
            the Bank and government team would have improved the quality of the initial
            report as it is only in it informing in an evidence based way on the
            performance of the government and its road agency in management the road
            sector could the indicator be justified as an outcome indicator. .

Nine of the ten output indicators were achieved. The indicator not achieved was that
relating to the production of design and maintenance manuals which is regarded as
partially achieved as not all of them were brought to use by the RDMID. . Regarding
local roads rehabilitated, the target (150-170 km) was exceeded with 211 km achieved.
Regarding secondary roads rehabilitated, with about 693 km rehabilitated of which about
62 km were later reclassified as local roads. Regarding the target of opening six regional
offices, while achieved, in reality, only the two at Batumi and Kutaisi are fully functional.
While guidebooks and workshops were held for local government officials as planned, it
would have been good to see these as continuous activities under the Project rather than a
one off activity given staff changes that would occur overtime. The same observation
could be made regarding the training of traffic police.

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency is rated as satisfactory.

After project completion, the Borrower carried out an ex-post economic evaluation of the
49 project roads, totaling 844 km - 11 project roads were financed under the original
project and 38 project roads under the additional financing. The ex-post economic
evaluation was done using the HDM-4 model adopting an evaluation period of 20 years
and a discount rate of 12 percent. Vehicle operating costs were derived for the four
vehicle types which predominate in the traffic mix based on current vehicle fleet
characteristics. The new economic evaluation would supersede the economic analysis
done at project appraisal for respective project roads financed under the original SLRP
and SLRP Additional Financing.

The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was recalculated for the 49 project roads
(Annex 3) by updating the baseline economic data with actual construction costs

                                             20
(GEL/km) and latest traffic growth rates (vehicles/day). The new traffic growth rates are
based on median growth rates during the last 4 years of SLRP implementation.

The ex-post ERRs show a significant variance, ranging from -0.7 to 99 percent. The ERR
was lower than 12 percent for 8 of the 49 roads. The overall ERR of the program is 24.7
percent, which represents a decrease of 20 percent over the overall ERR estimated during
the preparation of the additional financing (30.7 percent), and an increase of 4 percent
over the overall ERR estimated by the Roads Department during the project
implementation period (23.7 percent). Thus, an ex-post ERR of 24.7 percent indicates
that the rehabilitation program has a robust economic justification.

Other indicators of efficiency. The Project experienced delays early in its implementation
arising from more than expected time to arrive at cost effective designs for some of the
Project roads. Some of the initial tenders also experienced delays. The Bank and
Borrowers team recovered well from these delays and by mid-term review progress was
such that discussions could be initiated on a possible follow up project. A comparison of
estimated and actual costs of road works shows an increase of about 20 percent (see
Annex 3). This is not unusual and, indeed, a good outcome given the high inflation
experienced during part of the implementation period. While the civil works were well
implemented, the technical assistance elements and studies suffered significant delays
which diluted their impact on the Project’s outcome. Notable in this regard were those
relating to the preparation of the maintenance manuals and the geometric design
standards. The participatory approach built into the Project design proved to be a
challenge to the RDMID. To its credit, the RDMID over the project period came to
accept the merit of the approach and is now applying them in other ongoing projects.

A beneficiary survey was carried out (see Annex 5). From this, the following
observations and key impacts were identified:
   • Improved access to healthcare and the facilitation of qualified medical services in
       hospitals.
   •   Additional routes for minibuses have been added on rehabilitated roads due to an
       increase in public passenger demand in rural areas.
   •   Timely supply of commodities and other products to the village.
   •   Improved access to products & services in the district center, other district,
       regional center and Tbilisi.
   •   Improvement of the social services in the district centers, regional centers and
       Tbilisi.
   •   Advantageous road conditions for importing raw materials and exporting the
       products.
   •   Better participation of the local population in economic, social, cultural and
       political aspects of life in the country.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

This rating reflects: (i) the relevance of the PDO to the priority needs of the sector; (iii)
and the satisfactory achievement with regard to efficiency in relation to the EIRR and
other indicators of efficiency. Overall, activities under the Project have resulted in
improved condition of the secondary and local roads network. The percentage of
secondary roads in good condition increased from 40 percent to 61 percent as a result of
the length of such roads rehabilitated under the Project. The increased allocation for
maintenance expenditure and preparation and utilization of the 5-year rolling
maintenance plan prepared under the Project coupled with the adoption of Bank
procurement methods for the procurement of nationally funded works evidence increase
in RDMID institutional capacity to manage the secondary and local roads network.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project had a focus on poverty reduction through its Additional Financing with
achievement in this regard designed to be measured by the number of jobs created.
While the target was not achieved, what was would indeed have impacted positively on
the poverty situation in the Project areas by increasing available income for the purchase
of goods and services. The rehabilitation of the roads also had a more direct and general
positive impact on the livelihoods of those within the Project areas as evidenced by the
results of the beneficiary survey which clearly demonstrate that road users see the roads
rehabilitated as improving their access to economic and social services (see Annex 5)
carried out for the Project. Gender aspects of the Project were not specifically measured
or explored in the beneficiary survey and this is unfortunate.

(b) Institutional Change/ Strengthening

The Project improved the institutional capacity of the RDMID through the new
methodologies and practices that were introduced in the course of Project implementation
particularly in relation to efforts to induce a change in practice amongst project
consultants and contractors and RDMID staff, the implementation of the participatory
approaches to the selection of roads to be rehabilitated under the project, the preparation
of the manuals and design standards. The increased funding of maintenance by the
government has allowed the RDMID to see preparation of the 5-year maintenance plan
not as a theoretical effort but an important tool for improving the planning and
implementation of maintenance works in an effective manner.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Establishment of a monitoring system on the cost of road works was not part of the
project design but its addition has provided RDMID with a useful tool for monitoring the
cost of its road works and establishing bench mark unit costs. Similarly, establishment of
an inventory of the secondary and local road network was an additional activity which

                                             22
now helps the RDMID to make more rational decisions on needed interventions on this
network.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

See Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: This risk is rated as low to negligible.

The government continues to see improving the secondary and local roads network as a
priority evidenced by the ongoing SLRP2 and its indicated interest in receiving additional
assistance from the Bank to improve the network. The inventory of secondary and local
roads established under the Project is being maintained and used to assist decision
making on prioritizing interventions on the network. This and the 5-year maintenance
plan should help ensure a rational approach to the determination of future planned
interventions.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was well prepared, focused on priority needs of the sector and was based on
good background analysis. The design of the participatory approach for the selection of
local road to be improved was good. A technical assistance to help in its implementation
could have been a useful addition. A more realistic expectation regarding the number of
jobs to be created under the Project should have been adopted or the target revised once
more equipment based methods were being applied in executing the road work. An
analysis of the local domestic industry could have been usefully included in the Project
design to provide a more strategic basis for efforts to increase the capacity of the industry.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank supported the RDMID during implementation and provided timely guidance.
The mid-term review was well executed and crucial to redirecting the Project. The
number of restructuring that the project went through reflects the good project
management and the Bank team’s proactivity in supporting the government and the
RDMID. The first TTL during implementation was from Washington but was supported
by a team member based in the country office who later became the TTL: this helped to

                                              23
ensure continuity. The last TTL of the Project was also based in the country office. It
would have been good for the Bank team to include from the start of implementation a
road engineer specialized in rural roads. This could have helped to more timely resolve
issues relating to the quality of works. In 2009, such a person became a member of the
Bank project team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The satisfactory rating reflects the satisfactory rating for quality at entry and the
satisfactory rating for Project supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower demonstrated great commitment to achieving the objectives of the Project
evidenced by its compliance with the agreement to increase substantially funding of
maintenance and its willingness to provide additional financing from its own resources to
ensure achievement of the target number of roads to be facilitated.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance is rated as satisfactory evidenced by its willingness to effect changes to
its practices and adopt new methods and standards for carrying out the works under the
project. This assessment is not to disregard some of elements of resistance displayed at
times during project preparation and implementation. This is only to be expected given
the long tradition of applying Soviet era practices.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

This rating is due to the government’s commitment to the Project, demonstrated by its
willingness to increase its financial contribution to the Project as the economy improved
which led to the length of roads rehabilitated being far greater than envisaged in the
original project. Allowing the RDMID to use Bank procurement methods for road
rehabilitated from the national budget was a sign of confidence in the Project.

6. Lessons Learned

   (i) Supervision of works is a joint responsibility of the supervision consultant and the
       Employer. This requires that both have adequate staffing in terms of numbers,
       qualification and experience. This was not always the case during implementation
       resulting in poor workmanship by the contractor which were not corrected and
       inability of the RDMID to ensure compliance with provisions of the contract.

   (ii) During implementation, it is important for the Bank team to include required
        skills blend. For several years during implementation, the Bank team did not
        include a road engineer and this limited the outputs from site visits and thus the
        team’s ability to carry out its due diligence responsibility.

   (iii)For projects involving the rehabilitation of roads scattered over several locations,
        it is prudent to trigger OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and prepare an
        RMF. This would then allow the project team deal with any unexpected need to
        acquire land for project purposes.

   (iv) An assessment of the local construction industry should be carried out during
        preparation of a project with significant civil works activities particularly if
        several operations are needed. Findings and recommendations of such analysis
        should then be used to determine actions under the project to ensure adequate
        participation of the local construction industry in project implementation. Such a
        study should have been part of project preparation or included in the AF given the
        difficulties being experienced in adequately involving the local construction
        industry in the civil works.

   (v) During preparation of new projects with the same implementing agency, the Bank
       should be aware of the impact on the ability of the agency to effectively implement
       all of the projects with Bank involvement. This would allow it to better monitor
       the impact of its operations on the client as a whole, particularly in assessing the
       agency’s implementation capacity and determining what needs to be done to
       improve them. Over the period of implementation of the SLRP, the Bank
       approved three new operations for implementation by RDMID. These greatly
       stretched the capacity of the RDMID. Given the high profile of these new
       operations to the government, and their greater technical complexity, the needs of
       the SLRP were often secondary.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
The appraisal economic evaluation assessed the economic returns from rehabilitating
some 22 roads identified by RDMID as the most important secondary roads in the
network. These roads comprised 1,529 km out of a secondary network totaling 3,336 km.
The evaluation was done using the Highway Development and Management Model
(HDM-4) that perform a traditional cost benefit analysis of road investments, measuring
as benefits the reduction of road user costs (vehicle operating costs and travel time costs)
and maintenance costs with the project over the evaluation period. The evaluation
compared four different maintenance strategies ranging from patching and simple surface
treatment to full reconstruction. Based on that evaluation, the Project appraisal document
presented the economic evaluation results of three roads selected for the first year
program, totaling 58 km, only in terms of Net Present Value (NPV), without presenting
the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the first year program roads nor an estimated
ERR for the overall program, which is not good practice because it does not allow an
affective assessment of the robustness of the economic impact of the project.

The additional financing economic evaluation was carried out by RDMRDI using HDM-
4 and is based on the analysis of 377 km of the total 450 km of secondary and local roads
for which data was available, using 2008 traffic counts and cost estimates. The additional
financing economic evaluation confirmed the economic merits of the project, with the
ERR for the different road section ranging from about 10 to 92 percent, above the
adopted 10 percent discount rate, which is generally accepted for secondary and local
roads. Overall, the proposed additional financing was expected to generate an ERR of
30.7 percent. During the project implementation, when road sections were selected to be
part of the project, the Roads Department performed an economic evaluation of the
rehabilitation works of most sections taking into account the contract costs and using the
HDM-4 model. The overall ERR of the project roads estimated by the Roads Department
during the project implementation is 23.7 percent.

The ex-post economic evaluation evaluated the total 49 Project roads, totaling 844 km,
taking into account actual road work costs and current traffic information. Eleven Project
roads were financed under the original project and 38 project roads under the additional
financing. The ex-post economic evaluation was done using the HDM-4 model adopting
an evaluation period of 20 years and a discount rate of 10 percent. Vehicle operating
costs were derived for the four vehicle types which predominate in the traffic mix based
on current vehicle fleet characteristics. The table below presents the project roads length
(km), roughness (IRI, m/km) and 2008 daily traffic (vehicles per day). The project roads
were in very poor condition with roughness varying from 7 to 16 IRI, m/km, estimated by
subjective evaluation. The carriage width varies from 6 to 8 meters with most roads
having an 8 meter carriageway width.

  The daily traffic of the project roads in 2008, year in which traffic is available for all
  roads, varies from 156 to 4,393 vehicles per day with an average of 822 vehicles per day.
  The current average traffic mix is composed of 74, 21, 4 and 1 percent cars, small buses
  and pickups, medium buses and 2 axle trucks, and 3 axle trucks and trailers respectively.
  At appraisal, the estimated traffic mix was 72, 18, 7, and 2 percent respectively, which
  shows an increase in the percentage of cars, small buses and pickups over time due in
  part to the better road condition. The current traffic is available only for 17 project roads.
  The observed annual traffic growth rate from 2008 to 2011 on the 17 project roads show
  a significant variance, ranging from -10 percent to +25 percent per year, with a median of
  2.8 percent per year for all vehicles. The project appraisal document traffic growth
  estimated 5 percent per year for cars and 2 percent per year for the other vehicle types,
  representing a 4.3 percent annual growth for all vehicles. Thus, the observed traffic
  growth rates are lower than the appraisal traffic growth rate estimates.

  The average contract cost of the rehabilitation works on the total 49 roads is Lari 318,264
  per km, in 2011 Lari prices, while the average actual cost is Lari 324,852 per km, in 2011
  Lari prices, representing a 2 percent average cost overrun on the contracts costs during
  project implementation in constant terms. The average contract cost of the rehabilitation
  works on the 11 roads financed under the original project is Lari 258,951 per km, in 2011
  Lari prices, while the average actual cost is Lari 255,377 km, in 2011 Lari prices,
  representing a 2 percent average decrease on the contracts costs during project
  implementation in constant terms. The average contract cost of the rehabilitation works
  on the 38 roads financed under the additional financing is Lari 335,434 per km, in 2011
  Lari prices, while the average actual cost is Lari 344,964per km, in 2011 Lari prices,
  representing a 3 percent average cost overrun on the contracts costs during project
  implementation in constant terms.

  The road works were executed in different years from 2005 to 2011 and the Georgia
  consumer price index increased by 55 percent during this period. The chart below shows
  the contract and actual costs per km, in 2011 Lari per km, of the 49 contracts indicating
  that the rehabilitation cost per km increased over time in constant terms. During the
  implementation of SLRP Additional Financing the geometrical design standards have
  been improved, this being one of the reasons for the increase in costs and the need for the
  additional financing. The average rehabilitation cost of the 2005 road works is Lari
  255,377 per km (US$ 151,425 per km), of the 2009-2010 road works is Lari 299,167 per
  km (US$ 177,390 per km), while of the 2011 road works is Lari 415,184 per km
  (US$ 246,182 per km).

The ex-post economic evaluations of the 49 project roads was done adopting the actual
rehabilitation costs for each road, current traffic data, and an annual traffic growth rate of
2.8 percent per year. The ex-post ERRs show a significant variance, ranging from 2 to 99
percent. The ERR was lower than 10 percent for 8 of the 49 roads. The overall ERR of
the program is 24.7 percent, which represents a decrease of 20 percent over the overall
ERR estimated during the preparation of the additional financing (30.7 percent), and an
increase of 4 percent over the overall ERR estimated by the Roads Department during the
project implementation period (23.7 percent). An ex-post ERR of 24.7 percent indicates
that the rehabilitation program has a robust economic justification. The chart below
shows the histogram distribution of the ex-post ERRs.

In addition, the program of rehabilitating secondary and local roads created about 14,560
person-months of short-term employment in rural areas. This was lower than what was

                                                                                                 33
estimated during the preparation of the additional financing (24,000 person-months) due
to the optimistic planning of the indicator. In reality, modern methodologies and
technologies were applied in the construction process, which lead to the reduction of the
labor force. The methods were the following: (i) cold recycling method applied using
modern equipment and (ii) installation of concrete drainage canals carried out using the
special equipment.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
A beneficiary assessment 19 was carried out in 2009 to assess the impacts of road
rehabilitation, implemented under the Secondary and local roads project (SLRP), on the
local population. The assessment was financed by IDA credit (3938-GE) and was carried
out by “Sakgzametsniereba? Ltd (the Consultant), in accordance with the agreement
signed with the Roads Department (RD).

The Consultant performed the sociological study to measure the impacts related to the
life, commercial and business activity of the population residing in and around the
vicinity of the rehabilitated roads. The RD chose ten rehabilitated roads for the impact
assessment. Three questionnaire surveys were conducted to residents in 23 design
villages 20 and 23 control villages. Questionnaire No.1 asked questions relating to travel
mode, travel time, road conditions, accessibility to markets & services and other
demographic information. Questionnaire No2 asked questions to determine the impact of
rehabilitated roads on commodity supply, services, business development, the costs of the
main produce inter alia the local vegetables and costs of goods that are imported from the
outside. Questionnaire No.3 focused on assessing the satisfaction of beneficiaries and
overall selection/management of rehabilitated roads.

In general, the road rehabilitation has positively impacted the living and working
conditions of the local population. The following observations and key impacts were
identified in the study:
    • Improved access to healthcare and the facilitation of qualified medical services in
        hospitals.
     •   Additional routes for minibuses have been added on rehabilitated roads due to an
         increase in public passenger demand in rural areas.
     •   Timely supply of commodities and other products to the village.
     •   Improved access to products & services in the district center, other district,
         regional center and Tbilisi.
     •   Improvement of the social services in the district centers, regional centers and
         Tbilisi.
     •   Advantageous road conditions for importing raw materials and exporting the
         products.

   The Design Villages were within close proximity of the rehabilitated roads; connecting to the nearest
district center. On the contrary, the Control Villages were connected to the nearest district center by roads
in poor condition.

                                                    37
   •   Better participation of the local population in economic, social, cultural and
       political aspects of life in the country.
The assessment also identified key recommendations for improving the secondary and
local road network:
   •   It was recommended not to rehabilitate separate portions of one and the same road
       at different villages and regions. It recommended rehabilitating the whole stretch
       of road, thus solving the problems of several inhabited locals dispersed
       throughout the regions.
   •   It is desirable in regions (under the Governors’ administrations) to create the
       regional managements of local roads that would coordinate the activities of the
       local municipalities in the mentioned field and, would take care of mobilization of
       resources and direct the received transfers to appropriate tasks.
   •   The road teams/groups must be organized at municipal level and the mentioned
       groups would be responsible for regional management.
   •   It is necessary to organize training courses for motor road employees; such
       courses would be useful for improving the management and qualification of
       workers and engineers.

Introduction

Georgia is a sovereign state in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located at the crossroads
of Western Asia and Eastern Europe, it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea, to the
north by Russia, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to the southeast by Azerbaijan.
Georgia covers a territory of 69,700 km² and its population is almost 4.7 million. In 2007
Georgia's real GDP growth rate reached 12%, making Georgia one of the fastest growing
economies in Eastern Europe. The World Bank dubbed Georgia "the number one
economic reformer in the world".

Since 2004, the development of the roads infrastructure has been one of the top
priorities of the Government of Georgia, As a result, the Government of Georgia
applied to the World Bank for a loan to implement the Secondary and Local Roads
rehabilitation Project which was aimed at the support to the development of
agriculture and sub-regional trade. To this end, the Government of Georgia continues
to closely cooperate with Development Partners-Asian Development Bank, European
Investment Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency to implement construction,
rehabilitation, modernization of the roads network. Also, the Government of Georgia
with World Bank financing started the implementation of the Second Secondary and
Local Roads Rehabilitation Project after the successfully completion of the Secondary
and Local Roads Rehabilitation Projects

The Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (M.RDI) is responsible
for the road sector in Georgia. The ministry was established on February 2, 2009
according to Article 81 (2) of the Constitution of Georgia and Law on the Structure,
Powers and Order of Activity of the Government. The Ministry oversees regional and
national infrastructure development throughout the country, which includes modification
and modernization of state road networks of international and domestic importance.

The Roads Department 21 is the subordinated agency of the Ministry of Regional
Development and Infrastructure and is responsible for the management and
administration of the International and secondary road. The Roads Department is a
relatively streamlined road agency, with a total staff of 190, including 150 in
headquarters and 40 in the regions. Headed by the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen,
it comprises 11 divisions and units, and 6 regional offices. The Roads Department is
responsible for a road network of about 6.930 km. it has a ratio of about 2.7 staff /100
km, which is relatively low compared to other road agencies in transition economies.

Project Description

Financial Issues - The credit of US$20.0 million for the project was financed under a
Specific Investment Loan (SIL). This was considered the most appropriate for this
particular project owing to the nature of the pilot program it financed. Afterwards the
Government has requested the Bank to scale up activities under the well performing
SLRP by rehabilitating an additional 450 km of secondary and local roads, with a World
Bank ratio of USD 70 million, with a view to both increasing employment opportunities
and laying the ground work for improved productivity in the future. During the
implementation of SLRP/AF the Geometrical design standards have been improved.
The program of rehabilitating secondary and local roads was expected to create about
24,000 person-months of short-term employment in rural areas.

The project committed funds above the loan amount at the end stage of the
implementation. The causes of the over commitment were the following: the subsequent
appreciation of the GEL against the US$ caused а deficit of project funding and
additional civil works. To address the deficit and to al1ow the completion of works, the
Government allocated additional budget funding. To this context, the financing ratio of
Government share was increased till 50%, which was reflected in the restructuring paper
of a project.

Project Components:
The initial project had three components
Component 1: Rehabilitation of approximately 500 to 750 kilometers of paved secondary and
local roads, including between 150 to 250 kilometers of local roads.
Component 2: Strengthening the capacity of road sector institutions by improving engineering
standards and data collection capabilities, establishing between four and six regional offices for
network and works monitoring, development and implementation of regional road maintenance
plans, improved interactions with local communities, and traffic safety enhancements.
Component 3: Design and supervision of the road works. After the successful implementation of
the initial project the Components remained unchanged, but their scope increased to reflect
additional civil works and the technical assistance (TA). Therefore, the project consists of the
original project and the following additional parts:

     The financing ratio of the World Bank has been decreased from 70% to 50%

                                                    43
Component 1: The Rehabilitating about 690-710 23 kilometers of secondary and 150-170
kilometers of local roads in six regions throughout Georgia (Guria, Samegrelo, Imereti, Kakheti,
Shida Kartli, and Mtskheta-Tianeti) took place.
Component 2: Strengthening the Capacity of Road Sector Institutions
(a) Strengthening the capacity of RDMRDI and its six regional offices in management and
maintenance of the secondary road network through the provision of: (i) consultants’ services for
data collection; (ii) computer equipment, laboratory, equipment, vehicles and office furniture; and
(iii) training.
(b) Strengthening the capacity of local government units in management and maintenance of
local road network through: (i) the provision of consultants’ services for assessing needs and
resources of the local governments for roads maintenance and for designing a local road
management and maintenance resource manual; and (ii) conducting workshops for local
governments on local road management and maintenance.
(c) Provision of consultants’ services for preparing project audits.
Component 3: Designing and Supervising Road Rehabilitation through the provision of
consultants’ services.


Project Development Objective and Key Indicators:
     (1) Improve the Economic and Social Well-Being of the Rural Population in
         Selected Areas Through Upgrading of their Secondary and Local Road
         Networks. Socio-economic surveys by consultants have confirmed that road
         improvements made a significant impact on the economic and social well-being
         of rural Georgia. The surveys covered a random sample of 400 persons in five
         districts (Lanchkhuti, Gori, Kaspi, Gurjaani and Borjomi). In rating the various
         problems they face, the condition of roads ranked second only to health services
         as a problem for rural residents, with 93 percent of respondents rating it an
         important problem. Reduced transport costs increased the competitiveness of local
         produce, improved access to social services, i.e. schools and medical facilities,
         and to off farm employment opportunities, and in some cases spurred tourism
         development which in the past was an important sector of the Georgian economy.
         Indicators proposed for the baseline and follow-up surveys of villages in the zone
         of influence of improved roads were:

             • Reduction in transport costs/time

             • Increases in off-farm employment income

     (2) Improve the effectiveness of the Road Department of the Ministry of
         Infrastructure and Development to maintain a cost effective and sustainable
         secondary and local road network. MRDIRD’s capacity to deliver an efficient

  The capacity of the initial project has been reduced despite the additional financing due to the
improvement of the Geometrical Designs Standards.

                                                44
          road network depended on the adequacy of funding for maintenance and
          rehabilitation, and their ability to stretch available resources by introducing more
          cost-effective techniques. Following Indicators were adopted:

                 • Reductions in the unit costs of road works

                 • Annual expenditures on secondary and local road maintenance

     (3) Improve the effectiveness of Road Department of the Ministry of
         Infrastructure and Development in its interaction with communities and its
         responsiveness to local needs. MRDIRD’s responsiveness to local needs
         depended on the extent to which communities are made aware of road programs,
         and the extent to which their views and priorities are regularly expressed and
         taken into consideration. This requires well-functioning participatory
         mechanisms, for which the following indicators were adopted:

               • Annual publication of road condition, expenditure and future program
          information

            • Preparation of a proposal for annual local road improvements by each
          RMC

The project also assisted RDMID to establish regional offices six to allow closer linkages
with communities, and better monitoring of implementation.

*Note: The indicator was fulfilled only for 14560 man/months. It was conditioned by the
optimistic planning of the indicator calculated based on the financial resources for 1 man/month.
In reality, modern methodologies and technologies were applied in the construction process,
which lead to the reduction of the labor force. The methods were the following: (i) cold recycling
method applied using the special modern equipment (ii) installation of concrete drainage canals
will also be carried out using the special equipment that results in the decrease of the number of
the labor force.
**Note: The Regional Offices are located in Kutaisi, Poti, Batumi, Sagarejo, Borjomi. Selection
of the office space for Borjomi regional office is ongoing. The offices are provided with relevant
equipment with total of 25 persons employed. The responsibilities of the regional offices are the
following: cooperation with the local government in terms of roads maintenance and
improvement, providing the unobstructed traffic flow in the state of emergency, monitoring of the
ongoing activities.

                sections have been prepared by the four companies (locals, foreign) based on
                international procurement. The shortcoming of the detail design works was that the traffic
                safety measures were not considered for the certain sections of the roads. During the
                implementation of the civil works, as a result of the consideration of the above-mentioned
                issues, the additional commitments have taken place, such as: access roads of the schools,
                nursery houses, paths in residential areas.
                Note: The detail design for the seven road sections with approximate length of 30 km
                prepared by the SLRP AF is being implemented under II SLRP.

                Supervision                    – the supervision consultant was selected based on the international
                procurement and the contract was signed with Joint Venture represented by the foreign
                and local companies. In the earliest stage of the project, the reports submitted by the
                consultant did not include the sufficient technical information. After discussion of the
                format of the report, the parties agreed to adopt a new format to improve the quality of
                the information.

                Civil Works – around 35 foreign and local companies were employed under the project
                based on the international procurement. 631 km of Secondary and 211 km of Local roads
                have been rehabilitated. The total rehabilitated roads length is 842 km. Due to the
                shortcomings of the detail designs the additional works were executed to enhance the
                road safety measures recommended by the World Bank. Please see below the list of the
                rehabilitated road sections:

              Environmental Safeguard – Based on the nature and scope of the proposed project
              activities, the Project was classified through environmental screening as Category B. The
              project activities were confined to rehabilitation works on the existing alignment and
              construction of new roads or widening were not included. Therefore, the project did not
              carry any major risk of affecting important habitats, damaging forest stands, or affecting
              other ecosystems in any tangible and/or irreversible ways.
              Environment Impact Assessments were prepared and agreed with the World Bank for all
              49 road sections. The non-compliance in terms of the environment was observed during

                                                                                     51
the implementation of the civil works for the several road sections. The environmental
check list was prepared by the close cooperation between the World Bank’s and the
Roads Department’s specialists. The environmental check list was elaborated as a part of
the monthly report. As a result, the environmental part of the project was improved. The
Project rehabilitated 450 km of secondary and local roads within the alignments.

Social Safeguard            - the project significantly improved the basic access of the rural
population in Georgia by reducing the travel time to regional centers where various social
services and economic opportunities are available. The project also created short-term
employment through civil works, as well as mid-term employment in the form of routine
maintenance. All civil works were conducted within the existing right of way.
During the rehabilitation of the road section - Ozurgeti-Shemokmedi-Bzhuzhgesi the
land take cases on site took place. The RD has presented an inventory of the land take
cases which included names of each owner, and description of the land taken. There
were 15 cases of land take; in each case а strip of the land was taken and fence was
moved. About 4,000 m2 total land was taken, the maximum width of the land strip was 9
meters. In all cases the fences were rebuilt by the contractor.

Procurement - Under the Project the following procurement methods: ICB, NCB,
QCBS, QCS, LSC, IC, Shopping were used. 50 procurement activities have taken place,
which have been completed successfully.

Institutional strengthening A – Technical Assistance for Local Governments in
Management and Maintenance of Local Roads
The main objectives of this project was to strengthen the capacity of Local Self-
Governments in road maintenance and management as well enhancement of their skills

                                                   52
for realization of the planned road works through providing them concise and “easy to
use? manuals on:

I.     Planning and management of Local Roads in Georgia.

II.    Executing effective road maintenance.

Activities for this project included knowledge transfer and improvement of not only
planning skills, but also execution of effective maintenance activities.

Project covered mainly 5 major activities namely:

1)     Fact finding;

2)     Preparing the draft manuals;

3)     Approval of prepared final manuals;

4)     Publishing manuals, which were disseminated to the local governments.

5)     Implementation through seminars and workshops

Georgian and English version and have been distributed to all 69 local municipalities
through MRDI.
This project provided the basic tools for planning and executing road work activities.
However, the degree of success to improve the local road network in Georgia remains in
decisions to be made by the Central Government as well as the Local Governments for
sufficient budgeting for rehabilitation and maintenance works of local roads. Although,
having a good plan is important but being able to execute the plan is even more
important.

Workshop
The two workshops were led by the Ministry of Regional development and Infrastructure
and the Roads Department. The 2-day Workshop targeted participation of about two
representatives from each LSG (total of 140 from LSGs, as well as about 20 participants
from respective central government agencies). The participants were invited by the
Ministry. The consultant assisted the Ministry and RD to design the Agenda. The
Guidebooks/Manuals were distributed at the Workshop. The consultant prepared all
audiovisual and other materials for presentation at the workshop, made specific
presentations, and provided general logistical support. The workshops costs were a
reimbursable expense on the contract.

Institutional strengthening B - Inventory of Local Roads
Objective of the client was to establish a road and pavement condition database of local roads to
use with Road Management Systems to monitor network condition status and perceived benefits
from the maintenance practices.

This project was a first attempt to survey and digitalize local roads, therefore it included
identification and coding together with the inventory process. During the project more than
9000km of local roads has been surveyed according to specifications provided in the TOR which
in detail described the mandatory requirements for data collection. Currently all geographic and
inventory data is available in Roads Department’s GIS database.

This project was a parallel to the project “Technical Assistance for Local Governments in
Management and Maintenance of Local Roads? and is believed to improve and support planning
procedures for local municipalities by providing access to up to date condition and inventory of
local roads.

Institutional strengthening C - Technical Assistance for IT Technology

The consultant was provided with office space, equipment, supplies, etc. at the Roads Department
and worked with Road Data Unit team to strengthen, update and extend the existing data base on
a sustainable basis and to undertake systematic program level analysis of the road network to
indicate priorities for expenditures based on economic analysis. He was responsible for the
implementation and development of Geographic Information System (GIS), Road Development

                                               54
and Management System (HDM4) and the integration of different data types into the GIS system.
In particular, the consultant was responsible for:

Strengthening capacity of Planning Unit for road investment and maintenance to develop multi-
year investment and maintenance programs by implementing HDM-4 2.0 new version of the
software;

Calibrating the HDM-4 2.0 to better reflect local conditions. In the process, to achieve a level of
understanding of the system in Road Administration. Assisting Planning Unit with the
development of a programming method for annual road improvements and maintenance for
asphalt and concrete roads, and assisting with the preparation of a five-year rolling Highway
Management Program (updated annually); Providing support for GIS applications and assisting in
data migration, planning, and maintenance of above systems; Implementation of corporate
policies supporting data collection (inventory and inspection protocols) and condition analysis
reporting, for supervising a process of collection and renewal of data for road pavement and
inventory process; Developing and implementing the rules and procedures for providing data
security and integrity. Maintaining confidentiality with regard to the information being processed,
stored or accessed by the network; Training of the Roads Department and its regional offices staff
in data collection, use of GIS and HDM4 systems;

The assignment Assessment of benefit acquired by the population living within the area of
the executed road rehabilitation project has been prepared under initial SLRP. The report
proved the relevance of the project performance indicators.

Unintended Impacts

The road rehabilitation created the good conditions for transportation. New routes for the micro-
busses have been added in rural areas. 28

Based on the general observations, the number of the rural residents increased as a result of the
implementation of the SLRP Project.



Lessons Learned

     a) adequate number of the supervision specialists which results in the intensive supervision
        of each contract/object
     b) (ii)    adequate consideration of safety measures in the design documents and engineer
        design
     c) concentrated management and monitoring of the project from the side of the employer
