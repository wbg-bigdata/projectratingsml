PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND AGROINDUSTRIES PROJECT
(LOAN 2243-EGT)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Agroindustries Project in Egypt. Loan 2243-EGT, for US$81.2 million, was
approved on March 8, 1983 and closed on June 30, 1990 some 30 months behind
the originally planned date. Due to a declining sub-project pipeline (under
onlending terms of this project) the Government requested that US$24.7 million
of the loan be cancelled; US$56.5 million was disbursed, the last disbursement
was made on July 3, 1990.
Parts I and III of the PCR have been prepared by the Agricultural
Operations Division of the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA)
Region. Preparation of this PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan and Project agreements. supervision reports, progress reports provided by
the participating banks, consultant's reports, case studies, and disbursement
data. A consultant was recruited to prepare a Part II; however the report
submitted contained primarily disbursement data with no other assessment of
project implementation. Subsequently, the borrower was requested to prepare a
full Part II consistent with PCR Guidelines; this has not been received.
In mid-1990 the Bank employed a consultant to undertake case studies on
a subset of the sub-projects. A copy of this document is available in the
EMENA Information Center.

SECOND AGROUDUSTRIZS PROJECT
(LOAN 2243-RCT)
EVALUATON SUMAR
Objective
The principal objectives of the project were to: (a) add value to the
agricultural sector by financing investments to store, transform and
distribute agricultural conuodities; (b) strengthen linkages between banks
lending to the agricultural sector and small/sedium size agroindustries; and
(c) strengthen the capacity of these banks in identifying, appraising and
supervising agroindustrial loans to improve the investment quality.
Implementation Experience and Results
The project achieved its objectives in varying degrees. The banks that
participated in the project provided US $52.3 million in foreign exchange sub-
loans to small/medium size agroindustries which were disbursed over a six year
period. Technical assistance was provided to better train participating bank
staff in project preparation, appraisal and monitoring. Other technical
assistance personnel worked with the banks to assess the demands for agro-
processing lending and assist in developing a balanced lending portfolio.
These funds financed 136 sub-loans in agricultural and agro-related
enterprises. Most of the sub-projects are financially profitable; however, a
few have declared bankruptcy or ceased production.
While the objectives were met, at least in part, implementation
weaknesses remain. The appraisal and supervisory capacity of the
participating banks certainly improved. But their limited ability to assess
projects economically resulted in the approval of projects which proved
unviable when macroeconomic and sectoral distortions were subsequently
removed. Thus, further improvement in their analytical capacity is needed to
better evaluate projects.
The institution building process initiated under the preceding project
(Cr. 988-EGT) was furthered by the training consultants recruited and by the
experience gained; but, as noted above, further training is needed. The
technical assistance staff recruited to assess the agro-industrial sub-sector
and assist in strengthening the lending portfolio was determined to be
ineffective and was subsequently terminated. Given this unsatisfactory
experience the participating banks declined to recruit further assistance for
this purpose.
The bankruptcies and closed plants represent wasted resources and
detract from the value added objective. The reason for these bankruptcies lay
partially in the inability of the banks to assess the poultry sub-sector.



- iv -
Also, the requirement that loan repayment be in the local currency equivalent
of the foreign exchange loan at the time of repayment, coupled with a rapidly
declining value of the local currency, also contributed to the bankruptcies.
The foreign exchange risk issue caused the sub-project pipelines to dry
up and the cancelation of over one-fourth of the loan. Also, it created a
serious cash flow problem for sub-borrower repayments and increased arrears
for the banks. Lastly, it has resulted in legal action by the sub-borrowers
to escape the high nominal interest rate which reached 49X per annum and may
be higher for later maturing sub-loans.
Sustainability
Although the capacity of the participating banks to analyze projects
needs further strengthening, it is adequate to sustain an agro-industrial
lending portfolio; provided, however, that loans are in local currency. The
banks' capacity to evaluate foreign exchange risk remains inadequate and
developing that capacity is a high priority need.
Sub-loans for small agro-industrial enterprises have proven viable if
lending/repayment is in local currency. Small enterprises are typically
unfamiliar with external markets and produce only for the domestic market.
Small scale agro-industrial lending is sustainable but additional training in
financial management for both lending officers in the banks and borrower
entrepreneurs would further improve the quality of such lending.
Lessons Learned
The inability of small sub-borrowers to assume foreign exchange risk was
the key finding of the project. Small agro-industrial entrepreneurs who
process materials for the domestic market must borrow in local currency; when
foreign exchange is required it should be purchased on the spot market (i.e.
let the spot market assume the foreign exchange risk) as these borrowers have
neither the capacity to assess foreign exchange risk nor the mechanisms to
manage or limit the risk.
Sub-Sector reviews are necessary pre-conditions when indications point
to concentrated lending in a specific sub-sector. This is particularly
important where the macroeconomic and/or sectoral environment is distorted,
and financial and economic indicators diverge.
Sub-project aRpraisal in a distorted macroeconomic and/or sectoral
environment must be very thorough to ensure project viability when structural
or sectoral adjustment occurs. Although detailed economic rate of return
analysis may be impractical, adjusting the component prices which are most
distorted is necessary to ensure "normalcy" and "realism" in the appraisal.
In this regard the participating banks require further improvement in their
capacity to appraise and monitor sub-projects.



- v -
It is crucial that highly competent consultants be selected for
technical assistance assignments. Egypt, like many borrowers, is reluctant to
spend loan funds for technical assistance; in this instance technical
assistance was needed but the participating banks declined to replace a
consultant who was terminated for mediocre performance, as there were no
perceived benefits.
The imRlementation Reriod for this loan was overly optimistic. Even
discounting the drying up of the sub-project pipeline, normal procurement and
installation of equipment, civil works, etc. is a lengthy process. Final
disbursement on a sub-project may follow an initial disbursement by two years.
Thus, the closing dates for such loans should be not less than two years
following the last expected commitment.

(LOAN 2243-EGT)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Project Name:     Second Agroindustries Project
Loan Number       2243-EGT
RVP Unit    :    EMENA
Country     :    Egypt
Sector      :    Agriculture
Sub-Sector  :    Agroindustry
Background
1.    The project was identified by Bank staff as a continuation of the
activities initiated under Credit 988. These activities included the
development of the banking sector's capacity to appraise, implement and
monitor small and medium scale agroindustrial loans and to add value to
agricultural production through processing. The project was prepared by
FAO/CP who submitted the preparation report in November 1981; it was appraised
by the World Bank in March 1982. The project became effective in November
1983; the original closing date was December 31, 1987 but was officially
extended three times to June 30, 1990.
2.    The project was developed and implemented as Egypt was reassessing the
role of Government in agriculture. An agricultural strategy evolved in the
early 1980's, culminating in a strategy paper 3, which aimed at replacing
production disincentives that policy interventions had created over the post-
revolution period with positive incentives. A rationalized agricultural
pricing policy (inputs and outputs), agricultural land zoning and emphasis on
modern technical inputs and greater agro-processing were components of the
strategy. The strategy paper noted the high level of wastage in the marketing
system (particularly post-harvest losses of perishables), and the need for
more private storage and processing facilities.
3.    Much of the needed policy reform was delayed until the latter half of
the decade when policy reform was initiated in earnest. However, at the time
of appraisal it was perceived that there was little net intervention in the
agro-industrial subsector, as it was not significantly affected by the price
distortions that impacted upon agricultural production; subsidized interest
for "food security" investments being the exception.

4.    The project provided US$79.5 million for onlending for specific
agroindustrial activities plus US$0.56 million for training and technical
assistance (the total loan amount was US$81.2, which included capitalized
front end fee). However, some US$23.9 million was cancelled at Government's
request (Table 3), leaving US$55.7 for onlending.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
5.    The main objectives of the project were the following: (a) to add value
to the agricultural sector by financing activities to store, transform and
distribute agricultural commodities; (b) to strengthen links between
participating banks (PB) and small/medium size agroindustries; and (c) to
strengthen participating banks' capacity to identify, appraise and supervise
agroindustrial investments, thus improving the quality of investments.
6.    The project proposed to assist four participating banks to finance
agroindustrial investments throughout Egypt for the establishment, expansion,
and modernization of facilities for processing, marketing and distribution of
agricultural commodities and inputs. Investments were envisaged primarily in
the private sector but cooperatives and state owned enterprises also were
eligible. In addition, the project offered technical assistance to the banks
in three areas: (a) consulting services for project identification, analysis,
monitoring and evaluation; (b) training courses and fellowships; and (c)
computerization of monitoring and evaluation data.
Project Design and Organization
7.    This project followed the pattern established under Credit 988-EGT to
foster competition and broaden lending coverage by selecting four intermediary
banks, one more than participated in the First Agroindustries Project. The
participating banks were quite diverse. The PBDAC is the apex bank for the
sector, with the Banks for Development and Agricultural Credit (BDAC) as the
central agricultural banks in the Governorates; Development Industrial Bank
(DIB) is fully devoted to development banking primarily in the private and
cooperative sector; Bank Misr (BM) is a state owned commercial bank engaged
primarily in short-term lending (long-term lending capacity developed only
with the assistance of previous IDA Credits); and National Bank for
Development (NBD) is a newly incorporated bank with the legal status of a
private bank licensed to undertake commercial, merchant and investment
financing. Each participating bank had an extensive branch network, thereby
making funds available outside the main urban centers.
8.    The banks' on-lending interest rate was 15% plus a one percent
commission. As indicated in the Project Agreement, sub-borrowers were obliged
to repay their sub-loans in local currency in an amount equivalent to the
foreign exchange loan at the highest exchange rate (US$ to LE) declared by the
Central Bank at the time of repayment. The Government then bore the cross
currency exchange risk associated with loan repayment. Lending terms were for



- 3 -
a maximum of 15 years with a grace period of up to 3.5 years. Minimum sub-
borrower contribution for the various sub-projects was expected to be 15-20%.
9.    The project provided for technical assistance and the training needs of
PBs. Consultancy assistance was needed to improve portfolio planning and
management as lending was concentrated in only a few types of agroindustries.
Also, consultants were required to develop standardized procedures and prepare
guidelines and operational manuals. Similarly, monitoring and evaluation
activities were underdeveloped and needed computerization and integration in a
management information system. Training included one external fellowship for
each participating bank, basic lending seminars, project appraisal courses,
refresher courses and basic business management courses for new entrepreneurs.
10.   Coordination of the project was provided by the Ministry of Investments
and International Cooperation. But project organization and management was
vested in the four individual participating banks. The Government and IBRD
entered into a subsidiary loan agreement and project agreement, respectively,
with the participating banks. This was consistent with the organization
developed under the First Agroindustries Project. Each participating bank
dealt directly with IBRD as necessary on technical issues.
11.   The participating banks were to conduct subproject appraisal based upon
agreed guidelines including a minimum IRR of 12%, and supply, marketing and
technical criteria. Appropriations and approvals of subloans in excess of
US$1.0 million were sent to the IBRD for review and approval. The maximum
allowable subloan was US$2.0 million; subloans were permitted to state owned
enterprises but were to comprise no more than 25 percent of the lending
portfolio. To ensure that borrowers of small sums would be adequately
serviced, each Participating Bank was required to direct not less than 25% of
the loan to small borrowers (fixed assets of less than LE 500,000 and subloan
amount not more than LE 400,000).
Project Implementation and Results
12.   The project became effective in November 1983 and closed on June 30,
1990, thirty months after the original closing date. Each participating bank
prepared a sub-project pipeline prior to effectiveness, and was thus able to
implement on-lending activities upon the loan being declared effective.
Implementation problems centered on the tendering-procurement process and the
sub-borrowers' foreign exchange risk.
13.   The usual procurement delays were encountered and implementation began
slowly; the first onlending disbursements were made early in 1984. However,
momentum was quickly gained and disbursements of US$ 12.4 million, US$ 14.1
million, and US$ 10.7 million were achieved in 1985, 1986, and 1987,
respectively. But, as the central bank exchange rate began to deteriorate,
some sub-borrowers accelerated repayment, if permitted, while others did not
request disbursement. Due to the continuing devaluation, the project



- 4 -
pipelines dried up; the last sub-project approved was in October 1987,
although disbursements continued until July 1990.
14.   Although onlending was proposed to broadly address primary processing,
marketing, and distribution of agricultural commodities and inputs, the
appraisal documents specifically noted poultry production, dairies, bakeries,
and cold storage facilities as investment priorities and computed rates of
return for model investments. Also, specific reference was made to greenhouse
production of high quality horticultural products for export.
15.   The foreign exchange risk and the high implicit interest rate created by
devaluation was the major problem associated with the sub-loans. It rapidly
became apparent to the sub-borrowers that their financial position was worse
by having borrowed at the official exchange rate which required repayment at
the commercial exchange rate, than would have been the case if they had
borrowed local currency and purchased foreign exchange in the secondary
market. The following table indicates the situation under both scenarios as
it evolved and might be anticipated.

a/ See Annex Table 9
The central bank's foreign exchange rate reflected an overvalued currency
which subsidized the procurement of foreign exchange; thus repayment of a
five-year loan in local currency equivalents at the commercial exchange rate
would imply an annual interest rate of 49% (assuming the initial five-year
loan in foreign exchange at the free market rate). Clearly, borrowers'
financial situation would have been improved by borrowing and repaying in
local currency, and purchasing foreign exchange in the secondary market.
16.   Despite the explicit statements in the Project Agreement and Subsidiary
Loan Agreement relating to repayments to the PBs and to Government,
respectively, the terms of repayment were subsequently challenged and
interpreted variously. The Ministry of Finance wrote a letter to DIB stating
that it would be permitted to apply an exchange rate of US$1.00 - LE 0.84 to
repayments of loans committed prior to January 5, 1985 and a rate of US$ 1.00
- LE 1.34 to repayments of loans committed after that date. However, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs wrote to PBDAC indicating that repayment to



Goverrment should be on the basis of the exchange rate prevailing at the date
of disbursement of the sub-loan.
17.   The foreign exchange issue severely impacted upon the Participating
Banks through reduced repayment and increasing arrears. Prior to mid-1987
arrears were not a particular problem but by June 1988, repayments for NBD and
DIB were only about one-third of the amounts (principal and interest) due.
This improved somewhat as collections increased to 42% and 57% for NBD and
DIB, respectively by December 1989. Eighteen of 25 sub-projects analyzed in
mid-1990, had outstanding loan balances totalling LE 18 million; and overdue
principal and interest on the outstanding balances totalled LE 11.3 million.
18.   The repayment problem became so acute that 10 of the 25 sub-borrowers
mentioned above, where the loan was a major portion of the investment, have
taken legal action to escape the high nominal interest rate. This has
temporarily deferred repayment exacerbating the overdue accounts. A court
decision in favor of the sub-borrowers will transfer the profitability/cash
flow problems from the sub-borrowers to the participating banks and could
place them in a severe financial situation.
19.   Bank Misr concluded the foreign exchange issue would be a continuing
problem and made only one sub-loan after May 1985. In January 1987 it
informed Government it was unwilling to continue participation in the project.
It subsequently repaid Government the borrowed funds, rescheduled the sub-
loans which had not been repaid and converted them into local currency loans.
20.   None of the legal documents addressed the issue of prepayment (including
prepayment penalties), which also became a problem as prepayment conditions
were inconsistently applied; some sub-borrowers have prepaid without penalty
while others have been prohibited from prepaying. Other sub-borrowers have
claimed that "favored" clients were permitted to transfer their loans to local
currency before increases in the exchange rate.
21.   Sub-borrowers encountered other financial problems but they were
principally due to management difficulties. Sub-borrowers who obtained
financing for expanding their enterprises were more successful than were sub-
borrowers who were establishing new enterprises. The former were more market
conscious and more aware of quality control, purchaser responses to price,
etc. Records of sub-borrowers often differed from that of the banks and, in
turn, participating bank's records differed from those of the World Bank.
22.   The sub-borrowers felt that the loans were accompanied by excessively
stringent conditions, tedious procedures and long delays in issuing letters of
credit. The requirement that goods estimated to cost more than US$150,000
equivalent be procured through local shopping procedures, obtaining not less
than three written offers, were viewed as an unnecessary World Bank regulation
rather than a procedure to make efficient use of the sub-loan. Feasibility
studies were perceived as vehicles to obtain credit and not as a planning



tool; thus this requirement was honored more in the letter than in the spirit
of the requirement.
23.   Similar to onlending under Cr. 988-EGT, sub-project loans were
concentrated in poultry projects which accounted for about 24X of the total
amount on-lent. Other activities which accounted for significant proportions
of the total included bakery/confectionery, dairy production/processing, food
manufacturing, and packaging materials. The loans were well distributed
geographically within lower and middle Egypt (no sub-loans were made in upper
Egypt). The Cairo-Giza conurbation received 34 of the sub-projects which
accounted for about 23% of the loan value and the new cities (10th of Ramadan
and 6th of October) received a similar proportion of the loan. About 50% of
the loan was invested in projects outside the main urban areas. About 30% of
the loans were to small borrowers.
24.   Whether the sub-project focus on poultry, dairy, bakery/confectionery,
etc. was a promotion decision affected by the appraisal documents or was
simply the area where private entrepreneurs anticipated greater profitability
is uncertain. However, poultry investments did comprise the largest share of
the sub-loans and became the sub-sector experiencing the most financial
difficulty. In retrospect it is surprising that massive lending/investment
was promoted for a specific subsector without a subsector analysis. There
were several uncertainties in the subsector, including; the size of the
poultry/poultry product market, the impact of Ministry of Supply sales of
subsidized imported poultry meat, the availability of subsidized feedgrains
and the impact of its phase-out, and particularly the impact of devaluation;
all of which needed to be assessed. These factors, plus Government's
pervasive intervention in agricultural production and commodity marketing,
should have alerted all concerned that a sub-sector assessment was necessary.
The dynamics of these factors caused financial and economic profitabilities to
diverge and some of the poultry investments subsequently went bankrupt.
Without a subsector analysis and excluding ERR from the sub-project
feasibility studies substantial resources were directed toward poultry
enterprises which would subsequently prove to be unviable.
25.   About 50% of the on-lent funds created some 3200 new jobs in various
sub-projects; including all those financed by DIB and some financed by PBDAC.
The other participating banks did not systematically collect information on
jobs created in the sub-projects.
Sustainability
26.   A number of factors impacted upon the viability and sustainability of
the sub-borrowers. Their profitability and financial performance were
adversely affected by the devaluation of the local currency which resulted in
loan repayments much greater than anticipated. However, the continuing
currency devaluation had other unanticipated impacts, particularly on those
sub-borrowers that depended upon imported inputs; the poultry related



subsectors were seriously affected as imported maize subsidies were eliminated
concurrently with the devaluation. Other sub-borrowers were undercapitalized
as they often established their enterprises without considering working
capital requirements. Profitability was often related to the proportion of
self-financing.
27.   Although various management problems were encountered, they focused on
an inability to understand the market (competition, consumer reactions to
price and quality, consumer needs, etc.). The ubiquitous problem, however,
was the foreign exchange risk. The attraction of borrowing funds under this
project was the availability of foreign exchange at the central bank rate but,
ex Dost, all entrepreneurs felt they would have been better off by borrowing
local currency and buying the needed foreign exchange on the secondary market,
at the free market rate. Capacity utilization in about half of the
enterprises remains below feasibility estimates. Despite the problems
encountered, most of the non-poultry related sub-projects appear sustainable.
Some sub-projects in specialized activities (fish net manufacture, mushroom
production, etc.) are much more profitable than their appraisal estimates.
Financial rates of return were computed ex ante as part of the feasibility
study but, generally, were not evaluated ex post, except for 12 sub-projects
included in the study mentioned above. In these 12 cases, where the most
serious price distortions had been eliminated, the IRRs ranged from 16 to 39
percent. This sample of sub-projects appear to be representative of the
entire set, except for poultry related sub-loans; otherwise small and medium
sized enterprises, urban and rural, and various subsectors are represented
28.   The poultry subsector is still adjusting to the new price structure.
Three of 25 interviewed firms, all poultry related, are bankrupt or have
ceased production and another will likely fail. These four firms represent 10
percent of the funds borrowed by the 25 sub-projects. These failures reflect,
in part, the inability of the participating banks to compute ERRs. Despite
these shortcomings, the project succeeded in improving the capacity of the
participating banks to appraise sub-loans, thus improving the quality of their
future lending portfolio.
Bank Performance
29.   As this project was a continuation of the agro-industrial on-lending
project initiated under Credit 988-EGT, the Bank should have better understood
the problems of passing on the foreign exchange risk to sub-borrowers.
However, the magnitude of the underlying structural imbalance in the foreign
exchange market was not obvious at the time of appraisal and became evident
only during implementation.
30.   The project was supervised at regular intervals (Table 8b) and when the
issue of foreign exchange risk began affecting implementation, the missions
repeatedly met with Ministry of International Cooperation, Ministry of Economy
and Ministry of Finance officials requesting that the problem be resolved with
the Participating Banks and their sub-borrowers. This problem was common with



- 8 -
other on-lending projects, and a solution was implemented for some projects
(Small and Medium Scale Industry Loan, Ln 2458-EGT; Export Development Loan,
Ln 2459-EGT; and Construction Industry Loan, Ln 2460-EGT) through an option of
paying a 9% premium on loans repayable in local currency. (This reduced the
demand for project on-lending funds until the premium was reduced to 6.35% in
June 1989.) World Bank supervision missions suggested that this option apply
to Agroindustries II; however, the lack of systematic coordination by
Government resulted in no resolution of this issue.
31.   Bank staff reviewed the larger loan requests and, using economic prices,
recalculated rates of return, but, in retrospect it is apparent that the Bank
should have been more insistent that economic rates of return be computed for
all sub-projects where serious price distortions existed. This would have
applied particularly to poultry related enterprises. Such an analysis would
have identified those projects which might be financially unviable when
subsidies or other pricing distortions were removed. Also, given the
experience under Cr 988-EGT, and the expectation that a large volume of sub-
lending would be for poultry sub-projects, a sub-sector analysis should have
been undertaken to evaluate some of the policy and institutional issues not
assessed in sub-project feasibility studies.
32.   It is clear that in future projects the foreign exchange risk issue
should be thoroughly reviewed with the banking and other policy making
entities, and responsibilities be assigned which clearly delineate the
responsibilities of Government, Borrowing Institutions and sub-borrowers, not
only under prevailing conditions but under other potentially adverse
conditions. In this instance the disparity in the central bank and free
market exchange rates indicated the need for a currency devaluation; the
impact of devaluation could easily have been assessed. Also, prepayment
penalties should be clearly stated.
33.   It is equally clear that even if government intervention in a subsector
is minimal (e.g. agroindustry), but significant macroeconomic or sectoral
distortions exist, a sector/subsector study should precede the promotion of
such subsector projects. Sub-project preparation should include calculation
of ERRs; this is probably infeasible, but recalculating financial rates of
return with corrected values of the most distorted prices would be practical.
Borrower Performance
34.   The four Participating Banks, individually, performed relatively well
except for occasional delays in submitting audited accounts. Also, as noted
above, the participating banks had the expertise to evaluate sub-projects
financially but not economically; nor was such expertise developed during the
project. The participating banks wanted to improve their portfolio
management, but they were reluctant to employ consultants with borrowed funds;
thus only modest use was made of technical assistance.



35.   The Government was indecisive in addressing the exchange rate issue.
Although certain rulings were made regarding dollar exchange rates applicable
to borrowers' repayment obligations, they were of an ad hoc nature, sometimes
rescinded or not applied. The net result was the application of inconsistent
repayment criteria to the sub-borrowers; some sub-borrowers went bankrupt,
partially due to repayment at exchange rates 300% greater than the borrowing
rate, while other sub-borrowers took legal action to repay at the borrowing
rate; the courts have ruled favorably for some sub-borrowers and many cases
are still pending. The Government's position remains that the sub-borrowers
should bear the exchange risk.
36.   Except for delays in submitting various reports, covenant compliance was
good. Although the Project Agreement contained covenants pertaining to
repayment of the loan by the participating banks, there was no covenant
relating to the repayment of sub-loans by the sub-borrowers; these details
were specified only in the appraisal documents.
Project Relationship
37.   The relationships between the Bank, Government and the Participating
Banks remained good throughout appraisal and implementation. However, as
noted above Bank Misr withdrew from participation in the project in early
1987.
Consultinz Services
38.   A consultant, financed by the EEC, assisted in developing training
programs for the Participating Banks, building upon the capacity established
during implementation of AgroIndustry I Project (Cr. 988-EGT). Training
focused on NBD as it was a new bank participating in its first on-lending
project. Training addressed the organizational aspects of development lending
(developing and maintaining a project pipeline, portfolio diversification,
etc.) as well as project appraisal, supervision and evaluation; but project
appraisal analyses did not include economic rates of return.
39.   A local agro-industries adviser was recruited in September 1985 to
assist the Participating Banks assess the demand for such lending and develop
a balanced agro-industrial lending portfolio. The adviser's terms of
reference included assisting the PBs to identify investment opportunities
regionally and prepare marketing plans for small scale enterprises and assist
in preparing/maintaining balanced project pipelines. The adviser resigned in
June 1986 by mutual agreement as the PBs were disappointed in the poor quality
of his work. The adviser was not replaced as the PBs felt they could perform
this task adequately. In retrospect, it is apparent that a well qualified
consultant replacement could have well served the PBs and perhaps have
prevented the disproportionate lending in the poultry sub-sector.

Project Documentation and Data
40.   The loan agreement, project agreement, and subsidiary loan agreement
were generally adequate for achieving project objectives. The appraisal
report provided a useful framework for project implementation; the
Participating Banks were adequately evaluated but the estimate of sub-loan
demand was overly optimistic, primarily due to the exchange risk.
41.   The SAR was specific on exchange risk responsibility, but the Loan and
Project Agreements lacked a specific covenant on sub-borrower loan repayment
terms. This deficiency, coupled with the dislike of some sub-borrowers and
inability of others to repay principal and interest rates in the local
currency equivalent of the foreign currency borrowing resulted in repayment
arrears and the various legal actions.
42.   Over the course of the project the PBs improved their capacity to
appraise and supervise projects, but remained weak in analyzing in economic
(rather than financial) terms and in evaluating risk. Also, they remained
weak in sub-project monitoring and evaluation. Record keeping has improved,
information on repayments and arrears is readily available; however, there are
slight differences between World Bank and PB statistics on the volume of sub-
loans. This is partially due to fluctuating currency conversion rates.
Summary of Findings and Lessons Learned
43.   The key finding of the project was the inability of small sub-borrowers
to assume foreign exchange risk. Small agro-industrial borrowers invest in
enterprises which focus on the domestic market as, typically, they are
unfamiliar with external markets. Consequently, these borrowers have no
capacity to repay in foreign currency. Therefore, small agro-industrial
borrowers must borrow and repay in local currency; when foreign currency is
required it should be purchased on the spot market and let the spot market
reflect the exchange rate risk.
44.   Sub-Sector reviews are necessary pre-conditions when indications point
to concentrated lending in a specific sub-sector. This is particularly
important where the macroeconomic and/or sector environment is distorted, and
financial and economic indicators diverge.
45.   Sub-project appraisal in a distorted macroeconomic and/or sectoral
environment must be very thorough to ensure project viability when structural
or sectoral adjustment occurs. Although detailed economic rate of return
analysis may be impractical, adjusting the most distorted prices is necessary
to ensure "normalcy" and "realism" in the appraisal. In this regard the
participating banks require further improvement in their capacity to appraise
and monitor bus-projects.



- 11 -
46.   It is crucial that highly competent consultants be selected for
technical assistance assignments. Egypt, like many borrowers, is reluctant to
spend loan funds for technical assistance; in this instance technical
assistance was needed but the participating banks declined to replace a
consultant who was terminated for mediocre performance, as there were no
perceived benefits.
47.   The imRlementation period for this loan was overly optimistic.  The
normal procurement process, equipment installation, civil works
implementation, etc. is a lengthy process and final disbursement on a sub-
project may follow an initial disbursement by two years. Thus, the closing
dates for such loans should be not less than two years following the last
expected commitment on a sub-loan.
