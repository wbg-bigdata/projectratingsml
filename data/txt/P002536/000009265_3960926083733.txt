Borrower:          Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe
Amounts:
IDA:               $DR 3.1 million (US$4.0 million equivalent)
African Facilitys  SDR 2.3 million (US$3.0 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard
Co-financing:      African Development Fundt PUAs 7.0 million (US$8.5
million equivalent).
Including proposed MIO SAF of SDR 1.9 million (US$2.4
million equivalent), the financing package totals about
US$18.0 million.
Program            The proposed IDA Credit and Special African Facility
Descriptions       Credit would provide US$7.0 million to support the
Government's economic recovery program and allow econo-
mic activity to expand while the reform prQgram is
implemented. The policy package Includes a major
exchange rate devaluation, monetary and fiscal policies
Including the restructuring of the public investment
program and of loss-making public enterprises, price
liberalization and an incentive package to facilitate
private initiative. Technical assistance, financed
under separate arrangements, will be provided to
strengthen economic management In the areas of exchange
rate, fiscal, monetary and investment policies as well
as economic date collection.
Estimated          The Credits vould be disbursed in two tranches.  The
Disbursementst     first tranche of 8DR 1.5 million (US$2.0 million
equivalent) would be available upon effectiveness of the
Credits and the second tranche of about US$5.0 million
equivalent, following a performance review In mid-1988.
Estimated period of disbursements: September 1987 -
March 1989.
Benefits           The proposed structural adjustment program is expected
and Risks:         to improve the growth prospects of the economy through
better incentives, an adequate supply of producer and
consumer goods, more efficient allocation of foreign
exchange and concentration of Investment in the produc-
tive sectors. Also, it would help to create an environ-
ment favorable to private initiative and investment.



- ii -
One important risk lies in the inadequate administrative
capacity in the country, which may delay the implementa-
tion of the adjustment program. This risk has been
minimized by the progressive withdrawal of the State
from productive and commercial activities and by the
technical assistance (provided by several multilateral
and bilateral institutions and coordinated by the TUNDP)
which will assist the Goverment in managing the pro-
gram. To counter the risks associated with the removal
of distortions and the increase in tertiary sector
unemployment in the months following the devaluation,
the Government has introduced programs to alleviate the
impact of the price increases on the vulnerable groups,
including a redeployment fund to facilitate the reloca-
tion of redundant public sector employees.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TEE mECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT OF SDR 3.1 MILLION
AND AN AFRICAN FACILITY CREDIT OF SDR 2.3 MILLION
TO TEE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
FOR A STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit of SDR 3.1 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) and a
proposed credit of SDR 2.3 million (US$3.0 million equivalent), from the
Special Facility for Africa (SFA), established by resolution No. IDA 85-1
of May 21, 1985, on standard IDA terms to the Democratic Republic of Sao
Tome and Principe to support the Government's structural adjustment program
for the period 1987-88. Financing would also be provided by the African
Development Fund in the amount of PUAs 7.0 million (US$8.5 million equiva-
lent). The IMP would provide SDR 1.9 million (US$2.4 million equivalent)
through a Structural Adjustment Facility (SAP) covering 1988-90.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        An informal report on the country economic situation, discussed
with the authorities in Sao Tome and Principe in November 1986, presents an
analysis of the country's economic performance and sets forth the essential
elements of a comprehensive structural adjustment strategy. This section
summarizes and updates its contents. Economic data appear in Annex 1.
Given the weak data base, measurement of economic activities is subject to
an unusual degree of uncertainty.
3.        Overview. The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe
consists of two islands located in the Gulf of Guinea with a total area of
1,000 km2. Ninety-five percent of the total population (108,000) is
concentrated on the island of Sao Tome. At independence in 1975, the
country emerged from five centur'es of Portuguese colonization with an
economy overwhelmingly oriented towards the productioa of a single crop,
cocoa. Most of the agricultural land was nationalized and divided into 15
state enterprises. Cocoa production, which had peaked at about 36,000 tons
in 1920, stood at an estimated 10,000 tons a year in 1975. The country has
a satisfactory resource endowment and inherited a relatively good infras-
tructure from the colonial administration. However, because maintenance
has been inadequate since the late sixties, these assets are today in great
need of repair and rehabllitation. The soils are particularly suited for
the production of cocoa, although the variety of microclimates renders
possible the cultivation of a broad range of ciops.
4.        Recent Economic Performance: 1980-86.  Ten years after indepen-
dence, the country is facing its worst economic and financial crisis ever.
Primarily due to a sharp reduction in cocoa production from 6,000 tons to
4,000 tons between 1980 and 1986, GDP per capita declined by an estimated
30 percent in real terms over the interval. In spite of the adoption in



- 2 -
1984 of a series of economic measures aimed at reforming the incentive
system, internal and external imbalances remain at critical levels.  Both
the Government budget deficit and the overall deficit of the balance of
payments averaged over 40 percent of GDP during the 1982-86 period.  The
debt service ratio increased from 6 percent in 1981 to 63 percent in 1986.
5.        The continuous decline in cocoa production has resulted in a
marked deterioration in the public finance situation. Declining cocoa
revenues from export taxes and mounting transfers to finance the agricul-
tural state enterprises' operational deficits have contributed to the
emergence of large current account fiscal deficits (estimated at 10 percent
of GDP in 1986) largely financed by monetary expansion   Total credit to
the Government has been increasing by an annual average of 33 percent
between 1983 and 1986. The large public sector investment program (40
percent of GDP on average), which concentrated primarily on capital-
intensive projects that did not contribute significantly to value added,
was financed mainly through external borrowings, often at less than conces-
sional terms.
6.        The mounting debt service burden, together with declining cocoa
exports, have led to a rapid deterioration of the external accounts.
Between 1980 and 1986, deficits in the goods and services balance averaged
50 percent of GDP, and translated into corresponding deficits in the
current account balance, which have been financed through a draw-down on
external reserves, short-term borrowings in 1982 and 1984, reachedulings in
1984 and 1985, and a build-up of external arrears from 1983 to 1986 amount-
ing to over US$24 million at the end of 1986 (equivalent to over two years
of exports). Scheduled external debt service payments amounting to US$7.0
million in 1986 represented over two-thirds of the country's exports of
goods and non-factor services. The stock of outstanding external debt at
the end of 1986 (US$65 million, excluding arrears) reached the equivalent
of about 141 percent of GDP. External reserves represented only 6 weeks of
imports at the end of 1986.
7.        Assessment.  Although the sharp decline in agricultural output
experienced since the early eighties may be explained in part by technical
factors and lack of management, four fundamental policy deficiencies
contributed to the present economic difficultiess
(a) Overvaluation of the e=chanae rate. The nominal effective
exchange rate appreciated by about 80 percent between 1977 and
1985. Sao Tome and Principe's currency, the dobra, remained
constantly pegged to the SDR over this period, while cocoa
production declined from 10,000 to under 4,000 tons. This has
maintained import prices artificially low and eroded the competi-
tiveness of domestic product-on and exports;
(b) Lack of Rublic finance disclpline. The oversized public invest-
ment program, together with declining revenues from the cocoa
sector, have led to unsustainable public finance deficits.
Moreover, the investment program was based on projects that did



-3-
not contribute to the growth potential of the country. Only 5
percent of total investment in the 1982-86 period supported the
cocoa sector;
lc) Laxity of monetary and credit golicies. Enpansionary monetary
and credit policies to finance fiscal deficits have led, in the
presence of official price controls, to the appearance of paral-
lel markets for both domestic ard imported goods. As a result,
the purchasing power of workers in the state farms has fallen
substantiall;;
(d) Incentive policies. Trade and domestic wages ard price policies
have contributed to a distorted incentive system. The present
structure under which prices, wages and investment decisions are
made by the Central Government provides virtually no incentive to
increase productivity. The combination of wage arrears and lack
of consumer goods has acted as a powerful disincentive to produc-
tion.
8.        Since 1984, the Government has moved to progressively liberalize
the economy. Initial steps have been taken to withdraw the public sector
from cvwnercial activities, a new investment code has been adopted to
attract foreign private investment, and more recently, a land distribution
program has been initiated. Within this framework, the Government's
priority objective is to rehabilitate the cocoa sector. An increase in
cocoa production can be achieved in the short term through better crop
husbandry and improved management of the state enterprises. However, a
long-lasting recovery of cocoa output and of the agricultural sector at
large will depend on the successful implementation of an incentive reform,
which presupposes that the agricultural state enterprises are financially
viable. Given the severe distortions which currently characterize the Sao
Tomean economy, these reforms cannot succeed if a parallel effort is not
undertaken to introduce fundamental changes in the macroeconomic policies
that are one of the root causes of the decline of the sector. Considering
the size of the present imbalances and of the external debt contracted
prior to 1986, substantial balance of payments support would be required to
bridge the external gaps over the next few years, until the cocoa rehabili-
tation projects start yielding substantial increases in exports.
PART II. THE MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK AND THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. Overall Development Strategy
9.        In order to resolve the present economic and financial crisis and
to avoid a further deterioration of the situation, the Government of Sao
Tome and Principe intends to systematically pursue an outward-oriented
development strategy. This strategy will take advantage of Sao Tome and
Principe's relatively extensive natural resource base for the expansion of
agriculture and take into account the country's socio-economic structure
resulting from five centuries of monocultivation of cash crops and the very
small numbers of independent farmers. The Government's strategy, which is



- 4 -
outlined in the Government Statement of Development Policy and Action Plan
(Annex IV), is based on four essential objectives:
li)  create the conditions for a strong expansion of agricultural
output and exports based on the country's comparative
advantage in the cocoa sector as well as a progressive
diversification towards other export and domestic crops and
tourism-related activities. This would be achieved by
restoring external equilibrium through a real devalua- on of
the dobra and the adoption of more flexible exchange rate
and trade policies;
(ii) reduce the public sector deficit while shifting available
resources towards the productive sectors, particularly
agriculture. This would be achieved by restoring internal
equilibrium through speeific measures to increase current
revenues and reduce expenditures, a restructuring of the
public investment program in line with development priori-
ties and financing availability on concessional term, and a
restrictive monetary policy;
Ciii)  stimulate growth by initiating a broad reform of the incen-
tive system including pricing and wage policies aimed at
achieving a shift in the internal terms of trade in favor of
the rural sector and a greater private sector participation;
and
Civ) implement a financial strategy to mobilize the concessional
external resources needed to achieve stabilization over the
medium term and balanced growth over the longer term.
10.       Phasing of the Program.  Considering the severity of structural
distortions and the need to mobilize adequate balance of payments financing
over the next few years, the Government has decided to Implement its
macroeconomic policy reform in two phases:
(a) Phase I (remainder of 1987) is designed to remove the most
critical macroeconomic distortions (overvalued exchange rate,
excessive fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy) and
restore the profitability of the agriculture sector, cocoa in
particular. Phase I would be supported by the first tranche of
the proposed Credits, including retroactive financing (para. 63)
for an aggregate amount of SDR 0.7 million CUS$l.o million
equivalent). During Phase I, long-term technical assistance
(coordinated by UNDP and financed by the UNDP, AfDB, IDA and IMF)
would be selected to assist t.e Government in managing the
structural adjustment process tparas. 56-57).
(b) Phase II C1988), to be supported by the second tranche of the
proposed Credits and the proposed IMF Structural Adjustment
Facility (SAF), would consolidate progress under the first phase



-5-
of the adjustment effort, including the implementation of a
flexible exchange rate system, as wel; as measures to increase
public sector efficiency, to pursue the reform of the incentive
system, and to further liberalize the economy in order to set the
stage for sustainable supply responses under a more diversified
production system.
B. Restoring External Equilibria
11.       Exchange rate policy.  In May 1987, the Government adjusted the
exchange rate from 45.25 Dobra per SDR to 100 Dobra per SDR, in order to
reestablish the competitiveness of cocoa production and set the stage for
diversification of the agricultural sector.
12.       During Phase II, the Government will take further exchange rate
action by setting up a flexible system with the objective of eliminating
the gap between the official and the parallel market rates by mid-1988,
according to a schedule and a mechanism to be agreed with the IMF in
consultation with IDA. The Banco Nacional de Sao Tome e Principe (BNSTP)
would sell foreign exchange to any enterprise, trader or private citizen
who is prepared to pay the price set under the new system. During a
transition period up to mid-1988 before the flexible system is in place,
the Government would issue import licenses for non-essential goods to be
sold through an auction system within the framework of a foreign exchange
budget which has been agreed with the Association.
13.       Trade policy.  Since 1984, the Government has pursued a liberal-
ization of the trade system by allocating a portion of the available
foreign exchange to private traders. Given the overvalued exchange rate,
the Government recognizes that this partial liberalization has contributed
to the emergence of widespread parallel markets. The Government's long-
term objective is to completely liberalize the internal and external trade
systems. Urider the proposed Structural Adjustment Credit, significant
progress would be made towards this objective. As a first step in this
direction, the Government has decided to allow the private sector to
compete with ECOMEX for all import and export transactions (except for the
six products of the strategic list [para. 331) following the devaluation.
14.       During Phase II, the Government will take the following actions:
(i) convert, by March 1988, all specific import taxes to ad valorem rates,
and implement by mid-1988 a uniform ad valorem rate across the board,
except on the products included in the strategic list (para. 33) and in
(ii) below. The import tariff will be agreed with the IMF, in consultation
with IDA, in the framework of the review of the taxation system (para. 17)
and the schedule to reform the cocoa export tax system (para. 25); (ii)
impose an ad valorem surcharge on petroleum products and luxury goods,
including spirits, by mid-1988. The required magnitude of the ad valorem
surcharge will be determined with IDA and IMF assistance prior to its
implementation; and (iii) remove, by mid-1988, all quantitative import
restrictions.



C. Restoring Internal Eauilibria
15.       Fiscal Policy.  As a component of Phase I, the Government intends
to limit the current account fiscal deficit to Db 85 million in 1987,
versus an estimated Db 239 million without devaluation and fiscal measures.
To achieve such a reduction, the Government has adopted a series of mea-
sures on both revenues and expenditures including increasing civil service
wages in 1987 by a maximum of 10 percent following the devaluation and
reducing Government travel expenditure in foreign currency terms by half in
1987 (details in Annex IV).
16.       Public Enterprises.  In addition, the Government has launched a
comprehensive study of the public enterprise sector for which terms of
reference have been agreed. As the financial situation of the 15 cocoa/
coffee agricultut31 state enterprises will improve following the devalua-
tion and their individual performance will be analyzed under the Cocoa
Rehabilitation Project, the study involves the following enterprises: EMAE
(public utilities), Constructora EE (construction), EMAVE (poultry),
EMPESCA (fisheries), EMSERA I and II (bricks), ROSEMA (brewery), ECOMEX
(external trade), and ECOMIN (internal trade). The deficit of these
enterprises represents over 80 percent of the total public enterprise
deficit. The study's recommendations, including an action plan and a
timetable, will be reviewed by IDA and AfDB by March 1988. In the short
term, the Government agreed with IDA on a full pass-through of the devalua-
tion on the price of fuels and electricity by end-June 1987.
17.       During Phase II, the main objective of the Government's fiscal
policy is to achieve a surplus in the current account. Targets for the
Government's current account fiscal deficits and the overall budget defi-
cits for 1988 and 1989 will be established in agreement with the IMF under
the SAF and in consultation with IDA. In connection with this objective,
the Government will implement the following measuress (i) undertake by end-
1987 a broad review of the taxation system with DMF technical assistance,
and reach an agreement with the IMF and IDA by March 1988 on the implemen-
tation timetable of the new taxation system reform; (ii) based on the
result of the study of the public enterprise sector (para. 16), the Govern-
ment will adopt by June 1988 an action plan to be agreed with IDA and AfDB
to reduce public enterprise deflcits, to close the public enterprises whose
viability cannot be established and to privatize the public enterprises
whose activity is primarily in the productive and commercial sectors. It
is currently estimated that approximately 2,000 public enterprise employees
(out of a total public sector employment of 15,000) would be laid off
during Phase II; and (iii) reduce the size of the civil service according
to a plan to be drawn up by end-1987, in consultation with IDA and the INF.
18.       Reducing and restructuring the public investment program.  The
Government agrees that improving the efficiency of investment is one of the
principal conditions for the success of the structural adjustment and the
resumption of growth. In this respect, the Government has decided to
undertake a review of its public investment program in order to concentrate
investments in the productive sectors. Specifically, the Government agreed



- 7 -
to carry out only projects which meet acceptable criteria concerning the
economic rate of return (10 percent minimum), cost effectiveness (where a
rate of return cannot be calculated), and recurrent cost impact on the
budget. In addition, the start-up of major new projects is strictly
limited and their implementation will be subject to thorough technical,
economic and financial appraisal which will demonstrate their suitability
in the context of the public investment strategy and financial constraints.
19.       The Government has reduced the planned 1987 investment program
from US$42.0 million to US$19.0 million by delaying, redesigning and
eliminating non-priority projects. The Government, IDA and AfDB have also
agreed on the size and composition of the 1987 investment program. In
addition, the Government will seek AfDB and IDA agreement before implement-
ing projects not included in the investment program and whose total cost
exceeds US$500,000. Finally, the Government has decided not to carry out
projects financed on non-concessional terms (para. 36).
20.       During Phase II, the Government would pursue the broad review of
the public investment program, limiting it to projects which directly
support productive activities and rehabilitate existing infrastructure.
over the next few years, a substantial increase in the investment program
is necessary to rehabilitate the cocoa sector and improve infrastructure in
support of productive activities. The Government will agree with IDA and
AfDB on the size and composition of the public investment program for 1988.
An annual investment programming system will be developed in the Ministry
of Economy and Plan which will establish the criteria for project selection
and prepare an economic analysis for each project before its formal approv-
al by the Council of Ministers.
21.       Monetar  npolicy.  The Government intends to implement a restric-
tive monetary policy compatible with both the new exchange rate and the
overall budget deficit targets. In 1987, the Government intends to limit
new Central Bank credit to the Central Government to Db 400 million. This
limit includes the amortization of non-rescheduled external debt, a partial
repayment of internal and external arrears and is conelstent with the
targeted deficit in the current budget. The Gover-ment intends to use the
domestic counterpart funds of non-project borrowings to reduce BNSTP claims
on the Central Government and to cover the domestic counterpart of external
debt service to multilateral institutions in 1987. Taking into acciunt the
funds generated by the sale of foreign exchange from non-project external
borrowings, net credit to the Central Government is projected to decline
sigAificantly in 1987. In addition, the Government intends that increases
in credit to the private sector and public enterprises be used to finance
productive activities, and there will therefore be no increase in credit to
loss-making public enterprises.
22.       During Phase II, credit to the Central Government would be
reduced further in line with the reduction in the fiscal deficit in 1988 to
be agreed with the IW under the SAF. In addition, the Government will
agree with the IMF, in consultation with IDA, on an overall target for
domestic bank credit in 1988 and would implement the following measures:



(i) undertake within the BNSTP a study to separate the functions of the
National Bank from its commercial bank functions by mid-1988 (there is no
private financial institution in STP); and (ii) review the interest rate
structure with the objective of achieving positive real interest rates by
mid-1988.
D. Stimulating Growth
23.       Cocoa sector.  The basic thrust of the structural adjustment
program and the proposed Cocoa Rehabilitation Project is to restore cocoa
output by providing cocoa workers with adequate incentives, improving
management, introducing better crop husbandry and providing for the timely
availability of inputs. As a component of Phase I, in May 1987, the
Government: (i) allowed the exporting enterprises to maintain 30 percent
of their export proceeds in special central bank accounts abroad for the
purchase of necessary productive inputs; (ii) settled existing wage arrears
owed to workers by using available World Food Program (WFP) counterpart
funds; (iii) started to base wages on a combination of fixed wage and
productivity bonuses; (iv) introduced remuneration on the basis of piece-
work wherever possible; and (v) increased the fixed portion of wages by 30
percent over the 1986 level for field workers and team leaders following
the devaluation.
24.       Three factors would contribute to making the combination of a 120
percent devaluation and a minimum 30 percent increase in agricultural wages
a viable scenario; first, agricultural wages have often not been paid at
all in the past; second, considering the foreign exchange made available
under the structural adjustment program, the parallel market prices are
expected to actually drop following the devaluation because they currently
reflect the scarcity value of those goods; and third, wages in the agricul-
tural sector would increase faster than public eector wages following the
devaluation.
25.       During Phase II, the Government will pursue its policy of con-
tinued rehabilitation of the cocoa sector by implementing the following
measures by mid-1988: (i) periodically review, according to a methodology
and a timetable to be agreed with the Bank and the IMF, the foreign ex-
change retention scheme of the public enterprises. Once the foreign
exchange system outlined in para. 12 is in place, the foreign exchange
retention scheme will be phased out; (ii) present a plan, acceptable to the
Bank, for the phased settlement of the internal debt of the state enter-
prises to both the BNSTP and the Treasury; and (iii) prepare a plan,
acceptable to the Bank and the IMF, to reform the export tax system within
the framework of a new taxation system outlined in para. 17. Under this
system, the export tax rates would vary in line with international cocoa
prices in order to share the burden (rent) resulting from a price decrease
(increase) between the producers and the Government.
26.       Foodcrop producers.  Given the colonial heritage, there is little
small farmer tradition in STP. In order to generate the meaningful supply
response which is necessary to ensure the success of the structural



- 9 -
adjustment program, the Government will establish a line of credit to
provide short- and medium-term credit to private farmers. Its implementa-
tion wvil be studied under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project. In addition,
in May 1987, the Governments (i) abolished all price controls on domesti-
cally produced goods, including food crops: and (ii) allowed the private
sector to compete with ECOMEX on all import and export activities (para.
13).
27.       During Phase II, the Government intends to pursue its policy of
shifting the incentives towards the private sector by implementing the
following actions: (i) prepare a plan, with external technical assistance,
to focus and accelerate land distribution to small farmers currently
operating without a land title and public sector employees whose jobs are
terminated under the reform program; (ii) initiate the diversification
study included in the proposed Cocoa Rehabilitation Project by end-1987;
and (iii) extend, by mid-1988, the measures related to foodcrop production
included in the proposed Cocoa Rehabilitation Project to the remaining
agricultural state enterprises. Under this project, agricultural workers
are given access to family food plots as part of their remuneration.
28.       Fisheries.  Fish is the principal source of protein for the Sao
Tomean population. As a consequence of 400 small motors donated by the
Japanese Government in November 1986, production has increased substantial-
ly and prices have fallen by a factor of five between November 1986 and
March 1987. In order further to increase fish production, the Government
hast (i) abolishad price controls on private fishermen's catch; and
(ii) allowed EMPESCA to set its prices freely, taking into account market
conditions and reasonable production costs, including a provision for
depreciation. In addition, the Government will prepare an action plan, by
March 1988, to rehabilitate EMPESCA and reduce its operating deficit, in
consultation with IDA and AfDB (para. 16). This plan will in particular
address the issue of the two trawlers which do not operate satisfactorily.
29.       Energy.  Sao Tome and Principe relies heavily on imported fuels
for electricity generation, transport and industry. STP has been totally
dependent on Angola, from which it imports all of its fuel needs, and to
which it owes US$11.0 million in arrears on past oil shipments (about half
of all external arrears). The main problems that have affected the sector
ares (i) a pricing policy that does not cover production costs; (ii) low
levels and frequent interruptions of electricity generation due to the poor
state of repair of the equipment; and (iii) low priority given to tariff
collection.
30.       The Government's objective is to strengthen the institutional
structure of the energy sector and to reform pricing policies in order to
achieve full cost recovery by mid-1988. Specifically, the Government has
taken the following measuress (i) increased the price of fuels and the
electricity tariffs in line with the devaluation and (ii) reached an
agreement with IDA on the terms of reference of the technical assistance
needed for the long-term rehabilitation of the power and water sectors to



- 10 -
be financed under the IDA Line of Credit for Economic Rehabilitation and
Modernization (Cr. 1590-STP).
31.       During Phase II, the Government intends to give priority to the
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing installations, especially in the
hydroelectric subsector with technical assistance financed by AfDB, PAC and
IDA (through the Line of Credit). In particular, the Government wills (i)
contract by end-1987 the external experts and training program financed by
AfDB in order to strengthen the accounting and billing practices of EMAE
(the electric and water utility); and (ii) adopt by mid-1988, in agreement
with IDA and AfDB, a new tariff structure for imported fuels, electricity
and water in order to achieve full cost recover),
32.       Commercial services.  Before 1984, external and internal trade
had been under the total control of two state enterprises, ECOMEX and
ECOMIN. All goods were imported by ECOMEX and sold through ECOMIN (either
via ECOMIN retail outlets or via private traders). Prices were fixed by
the Government and private retailers' margins were tightly controlled.
Since 1984, the Government has moved to encourage more competition in
commerce, to limit direct price controls to 13 products and to reduce the
role of the public sector. In particular, the Government has rented out
ECOMIN's retail stores to private traders that are allowed to compete with
ECOMEX in importing goods under a system of foreign exchange allocation.
Consumer prices, however, continued to be controlled through the intermedi-
ation margins.
33.       The Government has decided to accelerate the liberalization of
the commerce sector and of pricing policies. The objective is to permit
the sale of domestic and imported products, including food aid, at market
prices in order not to undermine domestic output, particularly foodstuffs.
However, during an interim period the Government intends to sell six
products at low prices in order to cushion the social impact of the struc-
tural adjustment. Food prices will gradually rise to forestall the danger
of a permanent subsidy. Specifically, the Government has implemented the
following measures in May 1987s (i) elimination of price controls (includ-
ing intermediation margins) for all but six basic consumer goods included
in the strategic product list (rice, beans, milk, sugar, wheat flour, and
cooking oil); (ii) limitation of ECOMIN's scope of activity to food
security stock management and marketing of food aid and of the six products
included in the strategic list; and (iii) allowing the private sector to
compete with ECOMEX on the imports and exports of all goods (except for the
six products on the strategic list).
34.       During Phase II, the Government will pursue its policy of liber-
alization of the commerce sector by implementing the following measures:
(i) establish by March 1988, in consultation with IDA, a methooology for
the gradual adjustment of the price of controlled goods included in para.
33 and take initial action on prices of these goods by mid-1988. In
particular, the price of cooking oil will be increased in order not to
undermine the growing domestic production; (ii) prepare by March 1988, an
audit and diagnosis of the financial situation of ECOMEX; and



- 11 -
(iii) implement by mid-1988 an action plan acceptable to IDA to restructure
ECOMEX accounts.
E. Financial Restructuring
35.       Internal finance.  The key goals will be to increase the mobili-
zation of resources by the BNSTP and to allow the free allocation of credit
towards the areas of comparative advantage. The Government intends to
ensure that private and public enterprises receive equal treatment in the
allocation of credit and to achieve a positive real interest rate by
mid-1988 through the following measurest (i) reducing the inflation rate by
adopting restrictive fiscal and monetary policies (paras. 17 and 22); (ii)
increasing nominal interest rates according to a plan acceptable to IDA and
the IMF by mid-1988 (para. 22); and (iii) implement, with external techni-
cal assistance, a line of credit within the BNSTP to facilitate smallholder
access to credit.
36.       External finance.  The Government's assessment is that past
borrowing policies have led to the present financial crisis. The debt
service burden cannot be sustained without the aid of multi-year debt
reschedulings and/or debt relief, and the country will require a continuing
high level of external assistance on concessional terms for some years to
come. In this respect, the Government hass (i) banned the contracting of
loans and guarantees of loans with a grant element inferior to 50 percent;
(ii) adopted legislation ensuring that all concessional loans or grants be
approved of the Ministry of Finance; and (iii) prohibited the BNSTP from
borrowing on non-concessional terms except for short-term trade credits
that are purely self-liquidating within no more than one year.
37.       With respect to external debt, the Government has decided to
prepare a comprehensive medium-term financial strategy in close coordina-
tion with IDA and the DMP. This strategy will focus on mobilizing substan-
tial resources in the short and medium terms, but with a progressively
declining need for extraordinary assistance. The ratio of disbursed
external debt to GDP is expected to increase significantly over the adjust-
ment period (from 141 percent of GDP in 1987 to 262 percent in 1995). The
increase in the debt/GDP ratio is inevitable considering the need for
substantial foreign-financed investments in the productive sectors to
increase output. Because of the production lags associated with invest-
ments in the cocoa sector, the debt/GDP ratio is expected to decline
rapidly after 1995. Th, totality of the financing requirements (invest-
ments and balance of payments) are covered for 1987-88. Approximately
one-third of the total project and non-project financing requirements for
the 1987-95 period are already committed.
38.       The key elements of the financial restructuring strategy ares
(i) increasing grants to approximately US$10.0 million per year over the
1987-89 period, compared to an average of US$7.0 million In the 1985-86
period; (ii) approaching by mid-1987 the major creditors to which it owes
arrears to negotiate debt forgiveness, reschedulings and some fresh money.
At the same time, the Government's financial strategy is designed to ensure



- 12 -
that sufficient resources will be available to service all remaining debt
obligations, repay accumulated external arrears on a regular basis and
achieve a modest increase in external reserves; and (iii) mobilizing
additional capital inflows in the short and medium terms to finance the
costs of structural adjustment.
F. Medium-Term Economic Prospects
39.       The Bank's view of the country's medium-term economic prospects
is summarized below under the assumption that the Government will implement
in a rigorous and timely fashion the structural adjustment policy outlined
above and that additional external assistance resources will be made
available to the country on concessional terms for balance of payments
support.
40.       Two scenarios have been prepared to assist the country in the
design of a sustainable financial strategy. Both scenarios assume that the
policy reforms are implemented in a timely fashion. It is impossible to
identify a viable scenario without policy reforms. Arrears (about US$24.0
million) would be repaid at the rate of US$1.5 million per year over the
1987-95 period. Both scenarios also assume identical cocoa price projec-
tions. The Base Case Scenario (Table 1) assumes that an additional US$20.0
million would be invested in the cocoa sector between 1989 and 1993 above
the currently programmed level. Under reasonably optimistic assumptions,
this could lead to a growth in exports averaging 14 percent per year
between 1991 and 1995. Cocoa production in 1995 would stand at 12,500
tons, approximately 50 percent of the country's estimated capacity. Given
the technical and managerial uncertainties involved in the rehabilitation
of the cocoa estates, there is a likelihood that actual production may fall
short of these projections by about 10 percent.
41.       The additional US$20.0 million investment in the cocoa sector
during 1989-1993 could be achieved by an acceleration of the execution rate
of the cocoalcoffee projects currently in the pipeline. The scenario
assumes that five additional cocoa estates would be rehabilitated. An
accelerated execution rate is technically feasible since the labor con-
straint will be eliminated by the incentive package and the foreign firms
managing the estates have the capacity to rehabilitate additional enter-
prises. In addition, follow-up projects would have to be implemented ahead
of the current schedule to ensure continued implementation of this program.
This would imply advancing the proposed follow-up agriculture sector
project to be financed by IDA and by other donors involved in the rehabili-
tation of the sector. Under this scenario, the need for exceptional
balance of payments support (excluding food aid but including re-
schedulings) would average US$11.0 million per year (including US$5.0
million in fresh money) over the 1987-95 period. Scheduled amortizations
due to bilateral creditors as of the end of 1987 would be rescheduled in a
declining fashion from 1987 to 1995.  Approximately 80 percent

of scheduled bilateral amortizations are due to non-member countries
(mainly East Germany and the Soviet Union, both of which plan rescheduling
missions before July 1987). Guinea-Bissau's recent experience with resche-
duling its debt to the Soviet Union would suggeet that there are reasonable
prospects for STP to reschedule its debt to the major creditors on conces-
sional terms. The financing requirement would decline rapidly starting in
1990 and the fresh money requirements would disappear starting in 1994.
External debt outstanding would represent 273 percent of GDP and debt
service before rescheduling would represent 37 percent of exports of goods
and non-factor services by 1995.
42.       The results of the Downside Risk Scenario stress the seriousness
of the country's external debt situation and the magnitude of the turn-
around which is necessary to ensure the viability of the balance of pay-
ments over the medium term. Considering the investment currently scheduled
in the cocoa sector in the 1988-1990 period, exports would grow by an
average annual rate of 7 percent from 1988 to 1990 and 11 percent from 1991
to 1995. Under this scenario, cocoa production in 1995 is projected at
8,800 tons, or approximately twice its 1987 level. In spite of the projec-
ted increase in exports, the need for exceptional balance of payments
financing would exceed US$15.0 million per year over the 1987-1995 period
(including approximately US$9.0 million per year in fresh money), which
would be difficult to mobilize. Furthermore, the balance of payments gap
would only decrease marginally from 1992 to 1995. External debt outstand-
ing would represent 313 percent of GDP in 1995.
43.       The principal source of economic growth under the base case
scenario will be the impact of improved incentives on the agricultural
production, cocoa in particular. Production increases averaging 10 percent
per year over the 1987-95 period would be induced by the following factors:
(a) the entering into production of extensive acreage of foodcrop and
diversification crops as a result of the Government's new land
distribution and price liberalization policies; and
(b) the rehabilitation of extensive acreage of cocoa trees under the
projects financed with external assistance. The base case
scenario assumes that approximately 12,000 ha of cocoa would be
rehabilitated and/or replanted.
43.       In addition, there is a significant potential for increased value
added from the restructuring of the public enterprises and the increased
availability of imported inputs, particularly in the fishing, energy and
manufacturing sectors. At the same time, the reduced demand for non-
agricultural services implicit in the first phase of the structural adjust-
ment program would translate in lower rates of growth for this sector.
Overall, real GDP is expected to grow by 2.4 percent per year between 1987
and 1990 and by 8.4 percent thereafter. On the demand side, real private
consumption is projected to grow by 0.9 percent per year between 1987 and
1990 and by 4.4 percent thereafter. The burden of the adjustment falls
primarily on central Government services whose share in GDP is expected to



- 15 -
decrease from 42 percent in 1986 to 31 percent in 1990. In parallel,
overall consumption is expected to decline from 110 percent of GDP in 1986
to 79 percent in 1995. The share of investment in GDP (which averaged 35
percent of GDP between 1980 and 1985) would increase sharply between 1987
and 1990 and gradually decline to 35 percent by 1995. This is inevitable
given the need for considerable investments to rehabilitate the cocoa
sector and improve infrastructure in support of productive sectors.
Private investment would represent 20 percent of total investment in 1995.
44.       The restructuring period would be marked by a rapid improvement
of the public finance situation. As a result of the measures adopted to
increase revenues and reduce expenditures, the Government's current deficit
excluding grants is expected to decline from over 10 percent of GDP in 1986
to 5 percent in 1987. The Base Case Scenario assumes that the Government
would maintain a restrictive wage policy and implement rhe proposed tariff
reforms to maintain a surplus in the current account starting in 1988.
With respect to credit, the structural acijustment program would be marked
by a reversal of the policies followed until 1986. Between 1987 and 1991,
the Base Case Scenario shows that it would be possible to substantially
decrease BNSTP's net claims on the Central Government. This is consistent
with the policy of public sector retrenchment and '-yould allow the alloca-
tion of additional credit to the private sector.
G. Social AsRects of Structural Adjustment
45.       The Sao Tomean economy is expected to be able to adjust structur-
ally with a positive GDP growth rate by the end of the decade. The shift
in the internal terms of trade in favor of the rural sector will be accom-
panied by substantial increases in the incomes of rural households. The
new wage and price liberalization policies will directly benefit 10,000
workers and about 3,000 smallholders. While public sector incomes are
expected to decrease in the initial years of the structural adjustment, as
the public sector starts to retrench from productive and commercial activi-
ties, the incentive policies are expected to to promote growth and thereby
soften the overall impact of the adjustment program on employment. On
balance, the negative social impact of the structural adjustment will be
limited and outweighed by the benefits in terms of growth and efficiency
and by the specific measures to protect the most vulnerable groups (para.
47). In addition, the redistribution of incomes should shift in favor of
the agricultural sector, which would benefit a large majority of the
population.
46.       Nevertheless, the adjustment process, whether managed or not,
will require a reduction in Government spending and employment, particular-
ly in the public enterprise sector. The shift in resource allocation and
incentives will take some time to generate new investment and employment.
Accordingly, the Government will reduce spending primarily through savings
in areas other than the wage bill, while maintaining the bulk of employees
currently on payrolls during a transition period.



- 16 -
47.       As restructuring must not be allowed to falter because of a
negative social impact, the Government intends to protect the most vulnera-
ble groups and allow them access to the means to participate in development
as followss
(a) maintaining and increasing as appropriate the distribution of
food aid through the World Food Program (WFP). Currently, the
progrem provides basic foodstuffs equivalent to one-third the
daily wage of some 10,000 cocoa workers and directly distributes
free lunch to 20,000 school children. In addition, food for work
is provided to workers who build and maintain access roads to
schools. The Government will explore with the WFP ways to expand
food for work opportunities in road and other public works
maintenance and construction projects. In addition, increases in
the prices of six basic products included in the strategic list
will be phased to limit the impact of the devaluation on the
lower income groups (para. 33);
(b) improving the efficiency of public expenditures in social sectors
such as health and education by assuring adequate budgetary
allocations and by redesigning with external partners programs
and delivery systems to maximize the impact of such programs;
(c) monitor, starting in 1988, the social dimension of the structural
adjustment program through a UNDP-financed study managed by the
World Bank with the .bjective of: (i) developing and maintaining
an adequate data base on the social dimension of structural
adjustment, (ii) carrying out economic and social studies on the
implication of this adjustment, and (iii) strengthening the
official capacity of the administration to identify, appraise and
evaluate additional programs for poverty alleviation;
(d) during the transition period, the access to new opportunities
will be enhanced for the more affected groups by the distribution
of land presently not in use (para. 27). This program will
permit the development of a new category of smallholders and will
contribute to the diversification of agricultural product-ion, to
an improved supply of fcadstuffs on the internal market and to
the increase of exports; and
(e) establishing a redeployment fund with the objective of providing
for an orderly transition of public employees who are dismissed
as a result of the reduction of the public sector. These employ-
ees will receive training and will be oriented towards specific
projects (such as road maintenance) for a period of two years.
The employees concerned consist of 1,000 workers in the public
enterprises in various sectors (construction, fisheries, commerce
and industry) and approximately 1,000 employees in the adminis-
tration of the cocoa state enterprises. The Government will
allocate to the redeployment fund Db 60 million per year. The
workers assigned to the redeployment fund will receive the



- 17 -
minimum salary of Db 32.040 per year for a period up to two
years.
H. Benefits and Risks
48.       The proposed structural adjustment program is expected to improve
the growth prospects for Sao Tome and Principe's economy through improved
incentives, more assured availability of vital inputs, concentration of
investment on productive projects with a high return, and more efficient
allocation of available foreign exchange. Nevertheless, the Government
will face a number of risks:
(a) A less-favorable-than-expected international environment.
Considering the economy's heavy dependency on cocoa, t.e downside
risks are high if cocoa prices decline in the short and medium
term. If cocoa prices turned out to be 10 percent lower than
projected, the financing gaps would increase from US$11.0 million
per year (para. 41) to US$14.0 million per year. There are no
real alternatives to restoring cocoa production in the short run,
as colonial policies have implanted a production system based on
large cocoa estates which absorbed the totality of the work
force, leaving virtually no room for private farmers. In the
medium term, the transition towards a greater reliance on private
farmers will be facilitated by the reformed incentive system and
the change in land tenure which the Government is considering.
The proposed Cocoa Rehabilitation Project would include studies
on diversification and prepare a line of credit to the private
farmers;
(b)  Lower-than-expected supild  responses, especially from private
farmers, could prevent the realization of the targets for domes-
tic production and export growth, import substitution and GDP
growth. In order to generate the expected increase in domestic
food production, the land distribution program should be acceler-
ated, and the measures included in the Cocoa Rehabilitation
Project with respect to foodcrop p7oduction will have to be
extended as rapidly as possible to the remaining agricultural
state enterprises;
(c) Inadequate administrative capacity may prevent the Government
from successfully implementing the adjustment program in a timely
fashion. In order to minimize this risk, the adjustment program
has been designed for simplicity of administration. IDA is
coordinating closely with the IMF, the AfDB, the UNDP and bilat-
eral donors to ensure that the necessary technical assistance
positions are filled (para. 57); and
(d)  Socio-political risks.  The Government is making a major effort
through extensive radio coverage by the President and his cabinet
to explain to the population the justification for the reforms to
end the current economic crisis. In order for the program to



- 18 -
succeed, it is of the utmost importance that the devaluation be
accompanied by an adequate supply of imported producer and
consumer goods. In this respect, SDR 0.7 million (US$1.0 million
equivalent) from the proposed credits would be used through
retroactive financing to finance essential imports during Phase
I.
I. Aid Coordination
49.       The Government will work closely with international donors and
creditors to channel assistance according to the country's highest priori-
ties. In this regard, the Government plans to hold a restricted meeting of
donors present in the country in late 1987. This meeting, to be jointly
sponsored by AfDB and IDA, would discuss the mix of assistance among
project aid, food aid, and other non-project aid, and seek a solution to
the accumulated arrears and to the unsustainable burden of existing exter-
nal debt.
50.       The Role of IDA.  Sao Tome and Principe has been a member of the
Bank since 1977. Dialogue with the Government became more active beginning
in 1984 with discussion on the preparation of both the Line of Credit for
Economic Rehabilitation and Modernization and the proposed Cocoa Rehabili-
tation Project. A report entitled Issues and Options in the Energy Sector
was published in 1985 by the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Assessment
Program. IDA operations in Sao Tome and Principe will respond to the
Government's economic policy reforms as well as its request for assistance
in developing its human capital, strengthening its administrative capacity
and participating in the rehabilitation of the cocoa sector. Since the
problems confronting the country are deep-rooted and widespread, the
proposed SAL and Cocoa Rehabilitation project should be seen as first steps
to remove the existing distortions, strengthen key economic institutions,
and rehabilitate the cocoa sector. A follow-up Structural Adjustment
Credit would support the next phase of the adjustment process into the next
decade.
51.       The Role of Other Donors.  The UNDP has played an active role in
Sao Tome and Principe, sponsoring in 1985 the country's first Round Table.
A follow-up meeting on the sectors of agriculture, energy and water supply
was held in July 1986 and an NGO meeting was held in November 1986. The
UNDP would play a central role in assisting the Government in managing the
implementation of the action program by providing short- and long-term
technical assistance (para. 56). The AfDB and the EEC are the most
important other donors active in the country. In addition to being closely
associated with the preparation of the proposed Structural Adjustment
Credit, AfDB is supporting a cocoa/coffee rehabilitation project, the
improvement of the Sao Tome airport and a road rehabilitation project. The,
AfDB and the Bank have jointly appraised and will be jointly supervising
the proposed SAL. The EEC is financing a palm oil project and the rehabil-
itation of the energy sector. Many other donors are active in the country
and are increasingly concentrating their activities on the rehabilitation



- 19 -
of the cocoa state enterprises and in the energy sector. The principal
bilateral donors are currently France, Portugal, and Sweden.
52.       IDA/Fund Collaboration.  IDA has coordinated closely with the
Fund in the preparation of the proposed SAL. Fund staff participated in
both the preparation and appraisal missions of the proposed SAL, in partic-
ular to provide support to the discussions with the authorities on monetary
and fiscal policies. Based on the result of the SAL appraisal mission, IDA
and Fund staff have prepared a draft Policy Framework Paper (PFP) as a
basis for the proposed Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) requested by
the authorities in February 1987. The IMF and Sao Tome and Principe have
held preliminary discussions on the draft PFP and have reached a broad
agreement on its content. The IMF assessment is that the measures
described in the SAL would produce a major improvement in the country's
overall economic and financial situation and represent a very important
step toward the achievement of external viability.
53.       Use of Fund ordinary resources is not envisaged by Sao Tome and
Principe. It seems unlikely that the Government would be in a position to
service borrowings from the Fund over the medium-term. The Fund will,
however, provide vital assistance to the authorities in formulating their
macroeconomic policies, and specific annual performance targets in the
areas of monetary and fiscal policies will be agreed witb the Fund in the
context of the SAF. It is currently expected that a first year program
under the SAF would be in place before the end of 1987.
J. The Need for Institutional Reforms and Technical Assistance
54.       Institutional reforms.  In order to facilitate coordination among
economic ministries, the President reorganized the Cabinet in January 1987.
The Ministry of Economy and Plan is placed under the direct authority of
the President and will be responsible for the supervision of the structural
adjustment process. It is expected that the coordination of fiscal and
monetary policies will be facilitated by the creation in January 1987 of
the Ministry of Finance. One Minister is currently responsible for both
Finance and the National Bank (BNSTP), and acting for the Ministry of
Economy and Plan.
55.       The Government has also decided to prepare a medium-term macro-
economic framework that integrates national accounts, money, public fi-
nance, balance of payments and external debt. This framework will be used
for setting compatible targets, in particular concerning Government reve-
nues and current and capital expenditures, as well as ceilings on domestic
credit to the Government and on external borrowings as a function of the
projected evolution of the economy over the medium term.
56.       Technical assistance.  Given the limited number of qualified
civil servants, the Government's administrative capacity is weak. In
addition, the authorities lack experience in macroeconomic management.
Therefore, the successful implementation of the policies outlined in the
structural adjustment program will depend on the availability of



- 20 -
experienced technical experts to assist the authorities in managing and
monitoring the process. The proposed technical assistance would train
local staff and contribute to strengthening the main institutions. The
appraisal mission made an initial assessment of technical assistance needs
and reached an agreement with the UNDP, IDM and AfDB on how to meet these
needs.
57.       The staff of the IMF, Bank, and AfDB will assist the Government
in implementing the devaluation and related fiscal and monetary measures
through short-term technical missions. Given the small size of the country
and the relatively straightforward nature of its economy, a satisfactory
monitoring of the Structural Adjustment Program would be achieved in close
coordination with the IMF, the AfDB, the UNDP and bilateral institutions
around the following key positions for which draft terms of reference have
been agreed upons
(a) an economist (financed by IDA's Line of Credit) to advise the
Ministry of Economy and Plan on the coordination of fiscal and
monetary policies. This expert would be assisted by two UNDP-
financed experts (fiscal policy and administrative reform) and an
IM-financed expert setting up legal and accounting procedures at
the BNSTP (all three in place);
(b) an IDA-financed public investment- programmer and an AfDB-financed
project analyst who will assist the Ministry of EcoAomy and Plan
in implementing the new investment selection criteria as well as
putting in place a flexible aanual Investment programming system;
and
(c) a national statistical advisor to introduce a Living Standard
Measurement Survey and assist the Government in the set-up of
national accounts and a domestic price index (financed by UNDP).
PART III. THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDITS
Background
58.       Subsequent to the appraisal of the proposed Cocoa Rehabilitation
Project and an IMP Article IV consultation mission with IDA participation,
a report analyzing the country economic performance and discussing the
essential elements for a comprehensive structural adjustment stragegy
(para. 2) Was discussed with the authorities in November 1986. The
authorities expressed their full agreement with IDA's assessment and with
the overall objectives of the structural adjustment strategy. Two IDA
missions, both with IMf and AfDB participation, prepared and appraised the
proposed Credits in November/December 1986 and March 1987 respectively.
Negotiations were held in Washington from May 11 to May 15, 1987, with a
Sao Tome delegation headed by the Minister of Finance and Governor of the
BNSTP. A Statement of Development Policy sets out the action program
envisaged by the Government for 1987 and 1988 (Annex IV) and forms the



- 21 -
basis for this operation. There is no separate Staff Appraisal Report.
Supplementary Data appear in Annex III.
The Credits
59.       The Government's structural adjustment program would be supported
by a proposed IDA Credit of SDR 3.1 million and an African Facility Credit
of SDR2.3 million equivalent. In addition, the AfDB will provide FUAs7.0
million (US$8.5 million equivalent). The proposed Credits would be
disbursed in two tranches: SDR1.5 million would be made available imedi-
ately after effectiveness. Satisfactory progress by the Government in
carrying out the program is a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Cred-
its. The remainder would be made available after the Government has made
significant and satisfactory progress in implementing the structural
adjustment program including the specific actions outlined in para. 65
below.
Procurement. Disbursement and Retroactive Financing
60.       IDA financing will be limited to imports procured from eligible
countries. The Credits could not be used to finance items financed by
other sources or on a specific list of excluded items, such as military and
para-military items and luxury goods. Financing under the African Facility
Credit will be limited to imports procured from contributors to the African
Facility and Part II countries of IDA. Financing of foodstuffs would be
limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed a cumulative SDR 1.8 million
of disbursements under the proposed IDA and African Facility Credits.
61.       The import and distribution of goods would be handled by normal
commercial channels selected by the lmporter. Direct imports by the public
sector would follow IDA procurement guidelines. Imports over US$250,000
equivalent would be procured under international competitive bidding. All
awards of contracts of US$250,000 equivalent and above will be subject to
prior approval by the Association. Goods costing less than US$250,000
equivalent would be procured through limited international bidding by
requesting no fewer than three quotations from reputable suppliers.
Provision has been made for procurement by direct purchase by contracts
costing less than US$50,000 up to an accumulated amount not to exceed
US$1.0 million equivalent when demonstrated urgency requires, and for
proprietary items. Expenditures for goods procured under contracts of less
than US$10,000 equivalent would not be eligible for IDA financing.
62.       Disbursements under the IDA and African Facility Credits would be
effected through two special accounts to be established in a commercial
bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and into which US$1.0
million would be disbursed upon Credit effectiveness (US$500,000 equivalent
for IDA Credit and US$500,000 equivalent for African Facility Credit).
Replenishment of these accounts, up to the limit of the first tranche.
would be made when the accounts have beer. reduced by one-third, or monthly.



- 22 -
63.       Disbursements against contracts or purchase orders above
US$50,000 equivalent or under applications for direct payments or for
issuance of special commitments will be fully documented. All other
disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure certified by
the Minister of Finance or his authorized representative. For small
contracts between US$10,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, full documentation
including invoices will be retained for periodic examination by Bank staff,
and withdrawal applications would be consolidated and accepted on the basis
of written statements indicating the country of origin, a description of
goods, date and currency in which payment was effected, the commercial bank
involved and the final beneficiary. The Credits would be disbursed only
against foreign expenditures, with retroactive financing of expenditures
made before signing of the Credit Agreements, but after January 1, 1987, up
to an aggregate amount of SDR700,000 equivalent for the IDA and the African
Facility Credits.
Moonitoring
64.       The following actions have already been taken by the Government
in the context of the proDosed Droaram:
(a)  Closiuig the gap between domestic cocoa production costs and
international cocoa market prices by a 121 percent devaluation of
the dobra in domestic currency terms (para. 11);
(b)  Adoption of a satisfactory 1987 foreign exchange budget (para.
12);
(c)  Adoption of a satisfactory 1987 fiscal program, including discre-
tionary measures to contain expenditures and increase revenues
(para. 15);
(d)  Agreement with IDA and AfDB on the criteria for investment
selection (para. 18), and on the size and composition of the 1987
public investment program (para. 19);
(e)  Adoption of a satisfactory 1987 credit program, including the use
of counterpart funds to reduce BNSTP claims on the Central
Government (para. 21);
(f)  Agreement on a list of public enterprises for which a study,
including an action program, will be prepared for restructuring,
privatization and closure before second tranche release (para.
16);
(g)  Elimination of all price controls (including the intermediation
margins) for domestically-produced and imported goods except for
rice, beans, milk, sugar, wheat flour and cooking oil (para. 33);
(h)  Allowing the private sector to compete with ECOMEX on all import
and export transactions (except for rice, beans, milk, sugar,



- 23 -
wheat flour and cooking oil) on an equal basis and on limiting
ECOMIN's scope of activity to food security stock management and
to storage marketing of food aid (para. 33);
(i) Adoption of the interim foreign exchange retention scheme for the
exporting enterprises for the import of necessary inputs (para.
23);
(j) Settlement of the wage arrears to the agricultural workers and a
30 percent increase in the fixed portion of the wage paid to
field workers and team leaders (para. 23);
(k) Forbid the contracting of external loans with a grant element of
less than 50 percent (para. 36); and
(1) Distribution of land to private groups or individuals (para. 8).
65.       Release of the second tranche of the proposed IDA and African
Facility Credits would be contingent upon progress satisfactory to the
Association in implementing the structural adjustment program, in particu-
lar the following actions:
(a) the implementation of an exchange rate reform (para. 12);
(b) the implementation of an action plan to reduce the size of the
civil service (para. 17);
(c) the settlement of debt owed by the public sector enterprises to
BNSTP and the Treasury (para. 25);
(d) the implementation of a gradual increase of the price of rice,
beans, milk, sugar, wheat flour and cooking oil (para. 34);
(e) the approval of 1988 fiscal program and credit targets (paras. 17
and 22), including a public sector investment program (para. 20);
(f) the approval of an action plan to restructure, privatize or close
public enterprises (para. 17);
(g) the approval of an action plan for setting-up a new tariff
structure for fuels, electricity and water in order to achieve
full cost recovery (para. 31);
(h) the approval of an action plan to restructure ECOMEX accounts in
order to settle past debt (para. 34); and
(i) the approval of an action plan for the reform of the cocoa export
tax system (para. 25).

PART IV. WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
66.       Sao Tome and Principe joined the Bank and IDA in 1977.  In April
1979, the Government submitted a first project to upgrade the electric
power and water supplies in the country and IDA granted in 1980 a
US$350,000 Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance to prepare a suitable
project, but after appraisal Government withdrew its request because of
expected financing from alternative sources.
67.       In 1985, the Line of Credit for Economic Rehabilitation and
Modernization (Credit 1590-STP) was approved as the World Bank Group's
first operation in the country. The Line of Credit is designed to support
a series of institutional reforms and cover the foreign exchange costs of
small investments in agriculture, transport and energy, including the
financing of inputs in the cocoa sector. Following delays in project
start-up, the Government has recently recruited a project coordinator and
is preparing the first subprojects in the energy sector.
68.       The lending strategy followed by IDA in STP is directed towards
facilitating the recovery of its productive capacity. This implies8
(a) financing investments permitting the rehabilitation of the cocoa
enterprises; and (b) supporting over the next few years the Government's
structural adjustment program through cofinancing with other multilateral
institutions.
PART V. RECOMMENDATION
69.       I am satisfied that the proposed IDA Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
70.       I am satisfied that the proposed African Facility Credit would
comply with the provision of Resolution No. IDA 85-1 of May 21, 1985.
71.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit and the proposed African Facility Credit.

Annex IV
DROOCATIC  3UPUIC OF SAO Tom AND PRCIPE
Statement of Develovnmst Policy
I. Economic and Financial Background
Sao Tome and Principe is facing an extremely difficult economic and
financial situation, c'aracterized by several years of no real economic
growth, very large fiscal and external imbalances, and a rapidly rising
external debt service burden.
At the heart of this economic deterioration is the progressive long-
term decline in cocoa production in the agricultural enterprises, which has
accelerated in recent years. Output fell from about 10,000 tons in the
mid-1970s to about 4,000 tons in 1986. The decline in cocoa and other
export crops can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the
absence of worker and management incentives, insufficient Imported inputs,
lack of maintenance, and limited access to modern technology. In spite of
the increase in food production, the country still depends on imports for a
considerable amount of its needs, a large part of which continues to be
donated from abroad. In addition to the poor agricultural performance, the
Government has undertaken a number of large investments in the industrial
(beer, bricks, and construction), fishing, and transport sectors, which
have not made a significant contribution to national production but are
instead now imposing heavy recurrent costs to the Government. Some of
these investments were financed on less than concessional terms, and their
servicing is falling due.
The fall in agricultural production and exports has contributed to the
emergence of operating deficits for the 15 state-owned agricultural enter-
prises, which in turn has reduced their capacity to maintain the production
base, to pay the salaries of workers on a timely basis, and to contribute
resources to the Government budget. Instead, the enterprises have become
increasingly dependent on domestic bank credit and on transfers and credit
from the Treasury to cover their operating losses.
In general, the situation of the public enterprise sector can be
characterized by the following aspects:
-    absence of adequate management and accounting systems;
-    excess of employment and insufficient qualifications;
-    dependency on imported inputs, as well as on maintenance spare
parts leading to an excessive use of scarce foreign exchange;
-    overall, as the result of inadequate feasibility studies, the
investments were too large, which resulted in over-capacity in
relation to internal markets and little perspective for exports;
-    high energy consumption;
-    lack of coordination between the Ministries;
-    need for increasing transfers from the Treasury and credit from
the Central Bank to cover the operating costs.
This situation has had direct repercussions on the financial system.
In particular, the Government budget has been incurring large deficits, as



- 33 -
current expenditures have generally exceeded revenue by a substantial
margin and the current budget deficit (commitment basis) has averaged the
equivalent of 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) during this period
(1988-86). Two-thirds of the cumulative fiscal deficits of the last five
years have been financed by external resources, while the remainder was
covered by recourse to the central bank.
As a result of these large fiscal deficits, credit to the Government
increased on average by 31 percent of beginning money stock during 1983-84
and 9 percent of beginning money stock in 1985-86. Total dcmestic credit
has been increasing by 17 percent per annum during the same period. This
infusion of liquidity into the economy, along with a shrinking production
base, has led to high domestic inflation, estimated conservatively at 18
percent per annum during 1984-86, which, in turn, has been a major factor
in the erosion of competitiveness of the productive sector.
The resulting weak export performance, combined with consistently high
levels of imports, has also resulted in large external current account
deficits, which were equivalent on average to an estimated 33 percent of
GDP during the period 1983-86. To a large extent, these deficits were
financed by external borrowing and grants; however, the central bank was
also obliged to draw heavily upon its external reserves, and, to the extent
that these became exhausted, began to accumulate external arrears.  The
stock of arrears is estimated to reach US$24 million by end-1986, even
after completing the reachedulings of debts with Portuguese comercial
banks and with the German Democratic Republic. The debt service ratio
amounted to 63 percent in 1986 and the stock of outstanding external debt
reached the equivalent of about 175 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
Due to the lack of appropriate government economic policies to correct
the ever-increasing financial distortions, the effective exchange rate of
the dobra has appreciated significantly during the period 1977-86, in part
due to a constant peg to the SDR. The resulting large external imbalance
severely affected the profitability of the cocoa sector and has reinforced
the demand for imported goods and services. The exchange rate policy has
seriously reduced the incentives to channel resources to the export sector,
because yields on investment in that sector have been held down, while the
scope for increasing wages and other incentives to motivate the labor force
has been limited. Moreover, the artificially low domestic prices for goods
from abroad have accentuated dependence on imports, which, in turn, has
reduced the incentive to develop domestic substitutes. The overvalued
exchange rate has also tended to bias investment decisions toward projects
relying heavily on imported inputs, raising serious problems for their
viability in the medium term.

II. The Obiectives of the Structural Adiustment Program
Part A: Introduction
This program aims to implement a series of reforms in the economy.
These reforms will be oriented towards creating the conditions for the
development of cocoa production as a component of a medium-term strategy
aiming at liberalizing the economic system, including the progressive
withdrawal of the State from the productive sectors, a more efficient
allocation of public resour^es and the implementation of an incentive
system to increase and diversify production. This macroeconomic adjustment
strategy will be complemented by an internal and external financial strate-
gy. Among other objectives, this strategy will aim at reducing the exter-
nal debt service burden and at mobilizing external resources at conces-
sional terms.
Part B: Medium- and Long-Term Objectives
The central medium-term objectives of the Government's structural
adjustment policy ares
(a) to systematically achieve a shift in the internal terms of trade
between tradeables and non-tradeables in order to provide incen-
tives for exports and import substitution; and
(b) to significantly improve efficiency in the mobilization and use
of public resources.
The fundamental components of STP's development strategy over the long
term are:
(a) to raise per capita income in parallel with the restoration of
internal and external macroeconomic equilibria;
(b) to progressively diversify the economy away from cocoa by devel-
oping other cash crops and tourism-related activities.
While these objectives are adequate over the medium to long term, the
economy will nevertheless remain heavily dependent on cocoa for some time
and the rehabilitation of the sector is therefore a key priority for the
Government.
Over the next few years, the objective would be to restore the compet-
itiveness of the cocoa sector and to move toward macroeconomic equilibrium
by launching a macroeconomic adjustment process. Such a program will imply
a fundamental change in institutions and policies and should aim at cor-
recting the most obvious deficiencies in the exchange rate, monetary, and
fiscal policies, as well as in the system of economic incentives.
During the macroeconomic adjustment process, GDP growth would be led
by an expansion of exports, cocoa in particular. An intensification of the
policy of public sector retrenchment initiated by the Government in 1984
would imply a liberalization of the system of incentives in favor of



- 35 -
private economic agents and a progressive shift from the public to the
private sector as a source of savings and investment. The diversification
phase would aim at reducing the country's dependence on a single crop,
cocoa, and would be based on the development of the main areas of compara-
tive advantage in the agricultural sector.
III. Program of Action 11
Part A; Restoring Macroeconomic Eauilibria
a. Exchange Rate Policy
The Government will devalivs the dobra by 54.75 percent in foreign
currency terms (from Db 45.25 to Db 100 to the SDR) during the first
semester of 1987. As foreign exchange availabilities are unlikely to meet
demand during an interim period following the devaluation, a foreign
exchange budget will be established and managed by the central bank, which
will mobilize available foreign exchange to meet the higtest priority needs
of the economy for consumer and producer goods, with a view to avoiding the
re-emergence of parallel markets. As it is clear that available foreign
exchange from export proceeds and balance of payments aid will be insuffi-
cient to ensure an adequate supply of goods to the economy, Sao Tom6 and
Principe will need to pursue the efforts to renegotiate its external debt
service payments falling due over the 1988-99 period, as well as to mobil-
ize a substantial volume of non-project external assistance to finance
necessary imports. With the assistance of the IMP, the Government would
review over the medium term the appropriateness of the exchange rate
system, with the objective of avoiding the emergence of gaps between
official and parallel market rates. This will include the establishment of
a foreign exchange system under which the BNSTP would sell foreign exchange
to any enterprise or private citizen who is prepared to pay the price set
under the new system. In order to implement and effectively manage this
system, the Government intends to seek external technical assistance to
establish a consumer price index during 1987.
In the transition period, during which it is expected that foreign
exchange will continue to have a scarcity value somewhat above the official
exchange rdte, the Government will study the possibility of capturing the
scarcity value for all non-essential imports through the implementation of
an auction system for import licenses. Under the system under study,
specific import licenses would be sold to the highest bidder using a sealed
bid procedure. If only one bid is received for a particular import li-
cense, that license would be divided into two or more smaller licenses
which will be offered at a subsequent auction, in order to allow comp-
etitive access to the auction market. Aside from providing revenue to the
Government, this system would provide a means of measuring the imbalance in
11 A detailed timetable for carrying out these actions is attached.



- 36 -
the supply of and demand for foreign exchange, and will thus provide
valuable information for the setting of economic policy in the coming
months.
b. Fiscal Policy
The Government estimates t.-at after devaluation and after the imple-
mentation of new fiscal measures, the current budget deficit will amount to
some DB 85 million in 1987, compared with an estimated deficit of Db 239
million in the absence of a devaluation and fiscal measures. Reducing the
deficit to this amount will depend on the rigorous implementation of the
following fiscal measures (note: the size of the deficit will be reviewed
by the Government in the framework of the preparatory IMF mission to
discuss a specific program under the Structural Adjustment Facility): (a)
increasing all specific import duties in proportion to the change in the
exchange rate so as to ma'ntain their value in foreign currency terms; (b)
increasing sales taxes by 15 percent; (c) increasing fees charged by the
Ministry of Justice (which have not been changed since 1959) by 150 per-
cent; actualize airport fees to international standards and the excise tax
on petroleum products at the same level in foreign exchange terms; (d)
adjusting the retail prices of petroleum products and electricity, so as to
increase the transfers from ENCO and Rosema to the Government in proportion
to the exchange rate adjustment after covering the production and distribu-
tion costs of these enterprises; specific import duties on petroleum
products will be increased in proportion to the devaluation; (e) adjusting
the retail price structure of the six basic consumer items (rice, beans,
milk, sugar, wheat flour and cooking oil) in the strategic list to be
distributed by ECOMIN. The financing of subsidies on these six basic
products will be achieved through additional fiscal measures; (f) limiting
the increase in wages for civil servants to 15 percent for the salary
groups from L to Z' and to 10 percent for the other salary groups;
following the devaluation and during the rest of 1987, the monthly salary
bill after June 1987 will not increase by more than 10 percent over the
reference period (January 1987). However, these percentages could be
reviewed if the Government finds additional resources allowing the
maintenance of the current budget deficit at acceptable levels; (g)
reducing the expenditures of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by 20 percent
in foreign currency terms; (h) reducing foreign travel expenditures by
one-half in foreign currency terms; (i) limiting unclassified expenditures
from the Fundos Centrais to no more than the 1986 level (Db 81 million) in
nominal terms; (j) limit the increase in salaries of technical assistance
to the same proportion as civil servants; and (k) limiting the reduction in
domestic arrears to Db 20 million, while drawing up a complete inventory of
domestic arrears, excluding arrears on counterparts related to external
debt.
Over the next three years, the main objective of the Government's
fiscal policy is to achieve equilibrium in the current account. Targets
for the public sector current account fiscal deficits and the overall
fiscal deficits for 1988 and 1989 would be established by the Government in
consultation with the ADF, World Bank and the IMP. To this end, IMF



- 37 -
technical assistance has been requested. Among other measures, the review
of the taxation system would include the conversion of all specific import
taxes to ad-valorem rates and the removal of all quantitative import
restrictions.
c. Monetary policy
The Government intends to implement a restrictive monetary policy
compatible with both the new exchange rate and the overall public sector
deficit targets. Credit and monetary policies will facilitate the alloca-
tion of resources toward the priority sectors and promote financial inter-
mediation. For 1987, the Government agrees to set an indicative target of
Db 401 million for new credit to the Central Government. This limit
includes the amortization of non-rescheduled external debt (Db 124 mil-
lion), the repayment of external arrears (Db 172 million) and repayment of
internal arrears (Db 20 million). Taking into account the counterpart
funds of the balance of payments loans, net credit to the Central Govern-
ment will not exceed Db -767 million in 1987 (subject to the findings of
the DMF mission).
The use of counterpart funds of the structural adjustment loans is an
important component of the monetary policy. The Government's policy is to
use these counterpart funds only to reduce net BNSTP claims on the Central
Government and to finance the dobra counterpart of the debt service to
multilateral institutions in 1987 and 1988.
Over the next two years, net credit to the public sector would be
further reduced in line with the reduction in the fiscal deficits according
to targets to be agreed with the IMF under the SAF. In addition, the
Government intends to pursue the study to separate the functions of commer-
cial and central bank within the BNSTP.
The reduction in net bank credit to the Government in 1987-89 will
permit some increase in credit to the private sector and the public enter-
prises, while maintaining an overall reduction in total domestic credit.
This reduction in domestic credit will relieve, to some extent, the excess
liquidity which has accumulated in recent years, thus reducing the pressure
on the parallel market exchange rate and on domestic prices. An overall
target for domestic credit will be agreed with the IMF in the context of
the SAP. The Government intends that increases in credit to the private
sector and the public enterprises be used to finance productive activities
or the importation of necessary inputs and consumer items. To this end,
credits will be extended only on a short-term basis or to profitable
enterprises. There will be no increase in credit to loss-making public
enterprises. Finally, the Government will adopt an interest rate policy,
in consultation with the IMP, designed to reflect the opportunity cost of
capital in real terms, with the aim of permitting a better mobilization of
financial savings, as well as their more efficient allocation.



- 38 -
Part B: ImDrovina resource allocation
The Government has reviewed the public investment program for the
1987-89 period with a view to eliminating low-priority projects and intends
to carry out projects which meet acceptable criteria concerning the rate of
return (10 percent minimum), cost effectiveness where a rate of return
cannot be calculated, and recurrent impact on the budget. Accordingly only
projects for which concessional financing has been obtained will be imple-
mented. The Government will further discuss with the World Bank and ADB
the 1988 investment program as well as any additional projects it might
wish to implement in 1987 which are not included in the attached table and
whose cost exceeds US$500,000. The Government intends to refrain from
contracting and guaranteeing non-concessional loans (defined as those loans
with a grant element of less than 50 percent), except for short-term trade
credits that are purely self-liquidating within no more than one year.
The Government intends to implement a set of measures to restore the
viability of the public enterprise sector over the medium term and to allow
past public investment in those enterprises to yield a reasonable economic
and financial rate of return, while giving productive and more attractive
employment to the Sao Tom#an labor force and contributing to import subst;.-
tution. This would be achieved by a combination of short-term measures and
the implementation over the medium term of a public enterprise restruc-
turing program for which an action plan will be prepared by March 1988.
With respect to immediate measures, the Government would ensure that
the proposed devaluation would impact positively on the enterprises'
operating accounts at the time of devaluation by implementing relative
price increases and by setting an overall target for treasury transfers to
the public enterprises compatible with the restrictive monetary policy
under the structural adjustment program.
No credit from the BNSTP would be granted to the public enterprise
sector to cover operating losses in 1987. In the case of strategic enter-
prises, credit will be granted only in parallel with measures to ensure
that operating costs are covered.
In parallel with the implementation of the short-term measures, the
Government decided to launch diagnostic studies for the enterprise sector.
These studies, to be realized with the help of external technical
assistance according to the draft terms of reference after discussion with
the World Bank and ADP, would identify specific accounting, management,
marketing, and production problems and prepare an action program.
Enterprise studies will be launched and conclusions discussed with the
World Bank by March 1988. In this framework, the Government will implement
a uniform accounting system to facilitate the management of the enterprises
and, as general principles, promote management autonomy combined with
specific performance targets, especially with regard to pricing and access
to foreign exchange.



- 39 -
The Government intends to close the enterprises whose viability over
the long term cannot be proven (taking employment impact into considera-
tion), and will consider the privatization of the enterprises whose activi-
ty is primarily in the productive and commercial sectors. The phased
implementation of the action program (including reduction in personnel)
would be discussed with IDA and ADF in March 1988 with a view to initial
implementation by mid-1988.
Part Cs Incentive Policies
The basic thrust of the government's economic adjustment program is to
restore the output of the agricultural sector by providing workers with
adequate incentives, improving management, introducing better crop husband-
ry, and providing for the timely availability of inputs to the agricultural
sector. The Government intends to implement the following action plan:
(a) Wage arrears to agricultural workers will be paid in full by June
30, 1987, to be financed by available WFP counterpart funds. Mhe
agricultural enterprises will benefit from a greater autonomy
with the authority to hire and fire staff. Wherever possible,
payment on the basis of work performed will be introduced. If
the present work force containing an excessive number of non-
field workers is retained in the cocoa sub-sector, the labor
available will substantially exceed real requirements and wages
will constitute a disproportionately high percentage of agricul-
tural costs (some 67 percent against a norm of perhaps 40 per-
cent). Alternative employment opportunities are expected to
emerge for surplus workers over the medium term (point (e)). An
essential component of the new incentive system will be the
proposed reform of the wage system: wages will be based on a
combination of fixed wage (to be increased by 30 percent over the
1986 level for field workers and team leaders) and a productivity
bonus for the same categories. The agricultural state enter-
prises will be allowed to freely set the productivity bonus.
(b) In the last few years, the agricultural enterprises have been
given insufficient access to foreign exchange to import produc-
tive inputs which has accelerated the decline in production.
With the objective of improving this situation, the BNSTP will
open a special foreign exchange account for each of the exporting
enterprisc3 in a correspondent bank abroad. The BNSTP will
deposit a percentage (30 percent on average) of the enterprises'
export proceeds in the special accounts for the import of neces-
sary productive inputs. The categories of products eligible for
import will be published previously by the Government.
(c) The Government intends to promote private sector involvement in
the agriculture sector and the diversification of output through
the distribution of land to small farmers for the production of
food crops and export crops. The Government has prepared a legal
framework under which the land will be distributed, and intends



- 40 -
to seek external technical assistance to publish the legislation
regarding land distribution.
(d) An essential element of the Government structural adjustment
policy is to reduce the price distortions which have character-
ized the economy over the last few years. The Government policy
is to permit the sale of imported products, including food aid,
at market prices, in order not to undermine domestic output,
particularly foodstuffs. In this respect, the Government pro-
poses to implement the following measuress
(i) eliminate all price controls for domestic and imported goods
before end-May 1987, except for the products listed in (ii).
This would include all domestically-produced goods, in-
cluding foods;
(ii) during an interim period and with the objective of reducing
the impact of the devaluation on the poorest groups, the
Government intends to maintain the price of six basic
consumer goods included in the strategic list (rice, beans,
milk, sugar, wheat flour, and cooking oil). By March 1988,
the Government will establish in consultation with IDA and
ADF the appropriate methodology for the gradual increase of
the prices of said goods. By June 1988, the Government will
take initial action for the gradual increase of the price of
the six basic consumer goods included in the strategic list.
.e) As a component of the policy of structural adjustment, all
exports and imports will be open to the private sector with the
exception of the six products included in the strategic list
during an interim period.
(f) Following the devaluation a system will be established to period-
ically set the minimum producer prices, taking into consideration
the changes in world prices and the marketing costs. In this
respect, the Government will, before the end of 1987, study with
the assistance of the World Bank, a system to establish the rate
of export taxes as a function of international prices.
Part D: Financing Reauirements
The growth scenario and investment program for the Sao TomA and
Principe economy outlined above have as one of their major objectives an
improvement in the country's external trade balance through an increase in
exports and in domestic food production. Export earnings, which are
estimated at US$9 million in 1986, are expected to rise to US$9.2 million
in 1987, US$10.7 million in 1988, aud to US$13.1 million in 1990. However,
owing to the lags between new plantings and increased output in the cocoa
sector, the main effects of the investment program on export eanmings will
not be felt until the later 1990s.



- 41 -
In the meantime, imports of producer goods and basic consumer goods,
which have been severely depressed owing to foreign exchange scarcity, need
to be restored to levels adequate to maintain the functioning of the
economy. Imports (excluding capital goods) are projected to rise from
US$11 million in 1986 to US$15.5 million in 1987, and to remain at the
US$16-17 million level through 1990. However, by 1990 food imports will be
falling as domestic production responds to the incentives of the program,
and intermediate goods will assume a larger share of total imports. In
order to reduce the demands for foreign exchange, the Government will in
1987 reduce its expenditures on travel by one-half and in foreign represen-
tation by 20 percent. With rising exports, constant non-capital goods
imports, and savings in the services account, the deficit in the current
account, which will peak in 1989 at US$23.3 million, is expected to decline
thereafter.
Unfortunately, Sao Tome and Principe enters the structural adjustment
program with an extremely heavy burden of foreign debt. Debt service
obligations falling due in 1987 amount to US$8.5 million, or 73 percent of
projected earnings from the export of goods and services. Without a major
rescheduling to release resources for investment goods and the import of
basic necessities, no program in Sao TomE and Principe would be viable.
Therefore, the Government will seek rescheduling from all creditors other
than the mtltilateral agencies on the basis of a seven-year grace period,
fifteen years repayment period, and three percent interest, to be applied
to both current maturities and arrears. Assuming terms at least this
favorable can be obtained on average, the resulting debt relief will amount
to US$5.4 million in 1987, US$5.2 million in 1988 and an average of US$6.5
million in 1989-90.
In this respect, the Government is systematically seeking rescheduling
of non-multilateral debt and will seek ADF's and World Bank's assistance in
organizing a restricted donor meeting before end of 1987. This meeting
would aim at informing the donor community of the country's adjustment
efforts and the needs for project and non-project financing over the
1988-1990 period. The Government would also request the necessary techni-
cal assistance for the various ministries and the BNSTP. The Government
will coordinate the technical assistance requests with the World Bank, the
ADF, the IMF and the UNDP, as well ae with a few bilateral donors.
Sao Tome and Principe's foreign exchange reserves are also very low,
at about the equivalent of six weeks of imports as of end-1986. With a
growing level of imports, maintenance of the reserve level in relation to
imports will require an increase in gross reserves of about US$2.5 million
in 1987-88. Some repayment of commercial arrears, which now amount to
about US$19 mlllion, will also be necessary to maintain normal trade
relationships. It is estimated that US$2.3 million will be needed for this
purpose in 1987 and an average of US$1.5 million in the 1988-90 period.
After taking into account all of the above factors, the balance of
payments financing requirements (including debt rescheduling and drawings
inder the Structural Adjustment Facility of the IMP) total US$9.8 million



- 42 -
in 1987. As the economy responds to the investments and changed incentives
of the program, this requirement will fall progressively to US$8.7 million
in 1988, US$8.5 million in 1989 and US$7.9 million in 1990.
Part Et The Social Adiustment
The Sao Tom6an economy is expected to be able to adjust structurally
with a positive GDP growth rate over the 1987-89 period. The shift in the
internal terms of trade in favor of the rural sector will be accompanied by
substantial increases in the incomes of rural households. The new wage and
price liberalization policies will directly benefit 10,000 workers and
about 5,000 smallholders.
While public sector incomes are expected to decrease in the initial
years of the structural adjustment, as the public sector starts to retrench
from productive and commercial activities, the incentive policies will
contribute to improve the economic environment of the private sector and
will dampen the overall impact on employment. In balance, the overall
social impacts of the structural adjustment will be limited and outweighed
by the benefits in terms of growth and efficiency. The redistribution of
incomes should shift in favor of the agricultural sector, which would
benefit a large majority of the population.
Nevertheless, the adjustment process, whether managed or not, will
require a reduction in Government spending and employment, particularly in
the public enterprises sector. The shift in resource allocation and
incentives will take some time to generate new investment and employment.
Accordingly, the Government will reduce spending primarily in non-wage
areas, while maintaining the bulk of employees currently on payrolls during
a transition period.
As restructuring must not be allowed to falter because of adverse
social impact, the most vulnerable groups will be protected and be given
access to the means to participate in development as follows:
(a) maintaining and increasing as appropriate the distribution of
food aid through the WFP. Currently, the program provides basic
foodstuffs equivalent to half the daily wage of some 10,000 cocoa
workers and directly distributes free lunches to 20,000 school
children. In addition, food for work is provided to workers
building and maintaining access roads to schools. Government
will explore with the VWP ways to expand food for work opportuni-
ties in road and other public works maintenance and construction
projects. In addition, the six basic products included in the
strategic list will be maintained at present levels for an
interim period to limit the impact on lower income groups;
(b) improving the efficiency of public expenditures in social sectors
such as health and education by assuring adequate budgetary
allocations and by redesigning with external partners programs
and delivery systems to maximize the impacts of such programs;



- 43 -
(c) monitor, starting in 1988, the social impact of the structural
adjustment through a UNDP-financed study managed by the World
Bank with the objective of: (i) developing and maintaining an
adequate data base on the social dimension of structural adjust-
ment, (ii) carrying out economic and social studies on the
implication of this adjustment, and (iii) strengthening the
official capacity of the administration to identify, appraise and
evaluate additional programs for poverty alleviation;
(d) during the transition period, the access to new opportunities
will be enhanced for the more affected groups by the distribution
of land presently not in use, which will provide the necessary
social and economic infrastructure. This program will permit the
development of a new category of smallholders and will contribute
to the diversification of the production, to an improved supply
of foodstuffs on the internal market and to the increase of
exports;
(e) the Government will explore thE possibility of establishing a
credit fund to aid and train t..e employees which will be dis-
missed as a result of the rep cucturing of the public sector to
establish their own businesses. With the objective of providing
for an orderly transition of public employees who are laid off to
employment in other parts of the economy, the Government will
establish a personnel bank. These employees will receive train-
ing and will be oriented towards specific projects to be defined
by the Government for a period of two years. The employees
concerned consist of 1,000 workers in the public enterprises in
various sectors (construction, fisheries, commerce and industry)
and approximately 1,000 employees in the administration of the
cocoa state enterprises. A special fund will be set up amounting
to Db 60 million per year. The workers affected to the personnel
bank will receive the minimum salary of Db 32,040 per year.
