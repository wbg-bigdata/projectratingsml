FISCAL YEAR
July 1 - June 30
1/   On September 16, 1979, the Government abolished a tax/subsidy procedure
previously used to arrive at the official rate of exchange and a direct
rate of US$2.00 per Sudanese pound was established. Valuation of all
imports for customs purposes has been changed to the new official rate
(LSd 1.00 = US$2.00) from the old official rate (LSd 1.00 = US$2.50).
This Report is based on the findings of the appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. J. Shaukat and J. Larrieu who visited the Sudan in August 1978 and
in June 1979.

I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Local Energy Resources
1.01      At present hydroelectric power is the only indigenous source of
commercial energy available in the Sudan, where existing hydro stations supply
about 70% of the country's electric energy requirements. Preliminary investiga-
tions indicate that Sudan might have some fossil fuel resources (para. 1.04).
The country's non-commercial sources of energy are forests 1/ and vegetable
wastes (charcoal, sugar cane bagasse and stalks from cotton fields). Bagasse
is used in the sugar factories and charcoal in the households (especially in
rural areas) as a source of heat. The Sudan has no known geothermal resources.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.02      The waters of the Nile river represent the most important resource
for hydroelectric development in the Sudan. In the past, the Bank Group has
provided funds to the Government of Sudan to finance studies 2/ on further
major hydro power development possibilities. The best potential sites are
located at the various cataracts along the Main Nile, north of Khartoum.
Major hydroelectric developments suggested by these preliminary design studies
and investigation reports are listed below:
Approximate               Potential
Name                   head range (m)            capacity (MW)
Sabaloka (6th Cataract) 3/           5-10                        100
Shereik (5th Cataract)              18-27                    300-450
Merowe (4th Cataract)               29-37                    400-600
Dal (near Egyptian border)          28-40                    400-600
Shirri Island (4th Cataract)         8-20                        240
1/   Mainly in the south of Sudan.
2/   During 1977 and 1978 three reports were completed by Sir Alexander
Gibb and Partners: Blue Nile Waters Study, Investigations of Hydro-
electric Sites at Sabaloka and Jebel Aulia, and The Nile Waters Study
(draft report).
3/   The only detailed investigation report available on major hydroelectric
developments is the one produced for the Sabaloka site.



- 2 -
1.03      Development of the Blue Nile river potential is limited to the
expansion of the existing facilities at Roseires and Sennar power stations
where potential would be significantly increased after heightening of the
existing Roseires dam. The Roseires hydro plant capacity (para. 2.04) when
fully developed would increase by 120 MW and Sennar by 30 MW.
Hydrocarbon Resources
1.04      Pursuant to the Petroleum Resources Development Act of 1958, Sudan
is investigating and exploring its hydrocarbon resources in three maln areas:
offshore in the Red Sea, the South Central area near Bentiu and the North-
western area near the border with Libya and Egypt. Natural gas was discovered
in the Red Sea and the Government Is presently planning to continue with the
offshore exploration to determine whether the gas field is commercially
exploitable. Although no positive results were obtained in the Northwestern
area, the Government intends to continue exploration in the area in the
future. Geological, gravimetric and seismic investigations have been carried
out in South-Central Sudan. Exploratory wells were drilled during 1978 in
Babanusa and Malakal and oil of medium-light characteristics was found.
Investigations indicate that the area could have a major sedimentary basin
containing hydrocarbons. Additional exploratory drilling and investigations
are being carried out in this area to determine the size of the reserves. It
is expected that by 1982 investigation would be sufficiently advanced to allow
an assessment of real reserves and production capability of the area.
Petroleum Imports and Their Transformation
1.05      Petroleum products used in the Sudan are mainly processed at Port
Sudan refinery from imported crude oil. The refinery capacity for processing
various petroleum products amounts to about 1.3 million tons/year. The
processing structure of the refinery does not correspond to that of the
national requirements. About 35% of the gas oil and 44% of the kerosene
consumed in Sudan are imported, mainly from Kuwait. On the other hand there
is a considerable surplus of naphta and residual fuel 3500 R (national con-
sumption of these two products is negligible) which are reexported. The
proposed project and power development plans for Port Sudan which Include
installation of steam power generating units would result in the consumption
of a substantial amount of the residual fuel oil presently reexported. These
developments would also decrease the use of gas-oil and kerosene since the
change-over from gas oil burning diesel-based irrigation pumps to electric
pumps constitute a part of the load to be supplied from the new power stations.



-3-
Energy Demand and Supply
1.06      Commercial energy consumption in FY1977 was estimated to be about
930,000 tons of petroleum equivalent. 1/ Imported oil covered about 80% of
these requirements and the balance was met by hydroelectric generation. The
demand for commercial energy has increased annually at about 5% during the
period 1966-1973, and at about 6% annually during the period 1973-1977.
Production of hydroelectricity has increased at a much higher annual average
rate during the same periods, 23% and 17% respectively (it has increased from
64 GWh in 1966 to 269 GWh in 1973 and to 501 GWh in 1977). The use of com-
mercial energy by sectors is as follows: transport about 40%, agriculture
25%, industry 20%, households 10%, and government and municipal sectors 5%.
About 10% of the total petroleum consumption is used as fuel for generation
of electricity.
Relative Energy Pricing
1.07      The Government of Sudan regulates official prices for all essential
commodities including electricity, fuel and to a certain extent firewood.
In general, prices vary regionally as they reflect cost of transportation,
marketing, profit, taxation, etc. (Prices for some essential goods are fixed
at lower levels by levying lower taxes and for some less essential commodities
at higher levels through heavier taxation; in some cases, a cross-subsidy from
one commodity to another results). Prices of diesel oil and residual oil
750 R in Sudan (mainly used for power generation and large irrigation pumps)
are 14% and 33% below their prices calculated on import parity rates and
applicable transportation and marketing costs of those products, while gaso-
line and gas oil (mainly used in vehicles, small irrigation pumps and opera-
tion of gas turbines) are heavily taxed and are priced 42% and 29% above the
level calculated based on import parity rates. The different petroleum prod-
ucts presently consumed in Sudan are not subsidized by the Gdvernment. In
general their prices have been fixed satisfactorily so as to discourage the
use of petroleum products which are scarce in Sudan and have to be imported,
and instead provide incentive for use of those which are in surplus supply
and have a low economic cost. Electricity tariffs reflect geographical
differences due to differing proportions of thermal generation (in the Blue
Nile Grid 85% of the energy produced is from hydroelectric sources and in
the rest of the country the bulk of the energy is produced by fuel oil-based
thermal plants).
1.08      Firewood, kerosene and electricity are the most commonly used sources
of energy in Sudan's households. Firewood and kerosene are mainly used for
cooking, while electricity is used for lighting. The following table illus-
trates the relative energy pricing in Sudan:
1/   Ton of petroleum equivalent (TEP):
1 TEP = 10 x 10  Kcal
1 GWh = 330 TEP (based on thermal steam plant heat rate of 3,300
Kcal/kWh)



-4-
Price/
Kilocalories/unit         unit (LSd)        LSd/Kcal 10
Fuel-oil              10.0 x 106/ton              85/ton             8.50
Diesel-oil            10.2 x 106/ton             114/ton             11.17
Kerosene              10.3 x 106/ton             135/ton            13.11
Firewood               3.0 x 10 /ton              30/ton            10.00
Electricity          860/kWh                     0.025/kWh          29.07
This pricing structure seems to reflect scarcities quite accurately since
firewood is also scarce; Sudan's forests are limited to the Southern region
and distances are very great. The University of Khartoum is studying the possi-
bility of utilizing the thermal energy from the enormous quantities of cotton
stalks that are annually burned in the fields.
II. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
2.01      Although a very low proportion of the population of Sudan, about
8%, has access to electricity services this represents one of the highest 1/
in East Africa. However, small towns remain without electricity supply and
rural electrification is mainly limited to the more developed irrigated areas
located in the Blue Nile and Khartoum provinces. The present per capita
consumption of electricity, about 50 kWh/year, is among the lowest in the
world.
2.02      The Public Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC) is the main
producer and sole distributor of electricity in Sudan, generating about
90% of the total electricity produced in the country (para. 2.03). Self-
generating industrial undertakings account for the balance. 2/ PEWC has
divided into operational activities into nine geographical areas in order
to facilitate its administration. These areas are Khartoum, Blue Nile,
Damazin, Kordofan, Darfur, Southern Region, Red Sea, Northern and Eastern
Regions. Most of these areas contain individual small diesel plants
operating at individual population centers. Only the Blue Nile Grid and
Eastern areas include two or more interconnected power plants feeding the
major load centers in their respective areas. At present, each of these
1/   Percentages of population with access to electricity in other East
African countries are as follows: Tanzania: 7%, Kenya: 6%,
Lesotho: 3.5%, Zaire: 2%, Malawi: 2%.
2/   In addition several agricultural schemes along the Blue and White Nile
are irrigated by individual diesel-powered pumping stations. When these
stations are converted in the future to use electricity rather than
diesel oil, their estimated energy use would be about 120 GWh/year or
equivalent to 14% of the electricity produced in Sudan in 1978.



-5-
two areas operates its respective network independently; however, a trans-
mission line linking the two systems is planned to be constructed in the
future.
PEWC's Existing Facilities
2.03      PEWC's present installed power capacity is about 234 MW, of which
118 MW is hydroelectric and the balance is thermal (Annex 2.1). The principal
generating and transmission facilities are located in the BNG along the Blue
Nile with an installed capacity of 177 MW, of which 105 MW is hydro. The BNG
system produces about 90% of PEWC's total energy and supplies (a) the city of
Khartoum and surrounding areas, as well as Sennar, Damazin, Wad Medani, Hassa
Heissa, Es Suki, Singa and other individual centers, and (b) various irrigation
schemes at N.W. Sennar, Wad El Hadad, Guneid, Rahad and Gezira.
2.04      The BNG system comprises the following installations:  3 x 30-MW
hydroelectric units at Roseires station, 2 x 7.5-MW hydroelectric units at
Sennar station, 2 x 5-MW and 2 x 10-MW steam units at Burri station, 1 x 15-MW
gas turbine at Kilo X station near Khartoum, 8 diesel units (totalling 18 MW)
at Burri station and 9 MW (10 diesel units) at Wad Medani and Damazin stations.
A fourth hydroelectric unit at Roseires station rated at 42 MW 1/ and 3 x 5-MW
diesel units at Burri station, financed by IDA Credit 564-SU, are scheduled to
be commissioned during 1980 and 1981, respectively. The Roseires and Sennar
stations are connected to Kilo X substation (Khartoum) by a 485-km, 220-kV
double circuit (only one circuit strung), 2/ and a 270-km, 110-kV single
circuit transmission lines, respectively. The two transmission lines follow
nearly the same route and Sennar station is also tapped to the 220-kV circuit.
Several 110-kV and 33-kV subtransmission lines interconnect the different
step-down distribution substations to the main grid.
2.05      The plant capacities given above correspond to the nameplate ratings
of the production units. Due to seasonal variations in the operating para-
meters 3/ the effective installed capacity in the BNG at peak time was only
115 MW, 105 MW and 120 MW during the critical months of July, August and
September 1978 respectively (para. 4.01 and Annexes 2.3 and 4.1) when the
system demand was at levels above the system capability and load shedding had
to be resorted to in Khartoum and vicinity. During the months of January,
1/   The rating of this unit corresponds to the planned heightening (10 m)
of Roseires dam. The turbine rating for the existing head is similar
to the first three units, i.e. 30-MW.
21   Stringing of the 220-kV second circuit from Roseires to Sennar (215 km)
is being financed by IDA Credit 564-SU and is expected to be commissioned
in 1981; the second circuit from Sennar to Khartoum is planned to be
strung under the proposed project (para 3.09 (iv) and (vi)).
3/   During the months of March, April and May hydroelectric generation is
reduced as water is abstracted from Roseires dam for irrigation schemes.
Furthermore, Roseires and Sennar plants have reduced power capabilities
during the months of July and August due to the low net head available
as a result of low reservoir and high tailwater levels.

February and March 1979 the total BNG effective installed capacity was 148 MW
and the system demand was 123 MW, 126 MW and 137 MW respectively and therefore
reserves had to be reduced to 25 MW, 22 MW and 11 MW respectively, which is
even below the rating of a single hydroelectric unit at Roseires. The
condition in the remaining months of 1979 was worse than 1978 and early 1979,
and new power capacity is urgently required. The project will meet the needs
up to 1986.
2.06      The remainder of PEWC's capacity (57 MW) is made up of a number of
isolated stations in other areas. The largest of these installations are at
Atbara, Port Sudan and Khashm El Girba. Annex 2.1 shows a list of PEWC-owned
plants.
The BNG's Present Power Market
2.07      PEWC supplies electricity to about 165,000 customers in Sudan,
of whom 121,000 are located in the area served by its Blue Nile Grid (BNG),
which produces about 80% of the electricity consumed in Sudan. The distri-
bution of electricity consumption in the BNG by categories during FY1978 is
given below:
Category                      PEWC's Blue Nile Grid
GWh                %
Residential                   206              30.7
Industrial                    215              32.1
Agricultural                  105              15.7
Others                         48               7.2
574
Losses                         96              14.3
Total                         670             100.0
Total electricity sales in the Blue Nile Grid have increased annually at an
average rate of 11% from 375 GWh in FY1974 to 574 GWh in FY1978. Simultaneously
the system's maximum demand has followed the energy growth trend, increasing
from 86 MW in FY1974 to 126 MW in FY1978 (Annexes 2.2 and 2.3). It should be
noted that the BNG system energy requirement in 1978 was 670 GWh including
transmission losses, and this requirement was well within the capability of
the total production plant as seen in Annex 2.3.
Future Power Development Strategy
2.08      PEWC intends to expand its existing facilities in order to supply
energy to industries, irrigation schemes and other consumers in accordance
with the country's economic and social development objectives. Power schemes
which represent the least cost solutions are selected for construction. How-
ever the cost of energy is very high in Sudan due to (i) the gentle gradient
of the Nile flowing through nearly flat land, thus requiring very extensive
civil works even for a small head of water for hydroelectric schemes; (ii)



- 7 -
the consequent necessity to use large turbine-generator sets which can
accommodate large quantities of water; (iii) the need to import fuel for
operation of thermal plants; (iv) the relatively small demand in scattered
centers which can best be supplied with diesel sets that use very expensive
distilled fuel, even in Khartoum; and (v) the long inland distances where
transportation is very difficult and costly and consequently civil works
are both difficult and costly to implement.
2.09      To maximize the benefits and to take account of the requirements of
other sectors such as irrigation, municipal water supplies, transportation,
recreation, fishing etc. for which the Nile is also a very important resource,
the hydro development schemes have to be part of a total development program.
PEWC, under the pressure of immediate requirements (para. 2.05), has prepared
with the aid of consultants a development program for the BNG for the period
1978-1986 (paras. 3.06 and 3.07). This could not cover a longer period since
such a program would have to be coordinated with developments for which
studies were not then completed. However, at present, consulting engineers
are preparing a long-term plan for the Sudan (1985-2000). The Nile Waters
Study, now completed in draft form by Sir Alexander Gibb and associated
consultants, covers the use of the Nile waters for future development of
irrigation and power schemes. The Nile Waters Study master plan establishes
among other priorities the following sequence for development of the BNG
system for the period 1985-2000 and includes the following possibilities:
i)   10 m heightening of Roseires dam (for both irrigation and
power generation) and installation of the 7th generating
set at Roseires, 40 MW (1985-1990);
ii)   Addition of 30-MW hydroelectric capacity at Sennar (1985-1990);
iii)   Development of Merowe (4th Cataract) site on the Nile river,
north of Khartoum, 600 MW (1995-2000);
iv)   Addition of 30-MW hydroelectric capacity at Khashm el Girba
dam on the Atbara river (1985-1990); and
v)   Further extension of thermal generating capacity at Khartoum.
In addition to the above options, the Long-Term Power Plan (1985-2000) will
identify suitable new thermal expansion for PEWC systems outside the BNG and
their interconnection, if feasible.
Electrification of Isolated Urban Centers
2.10      Electricity supply is very limited in urban centers which are
distant from the developed area of the Blue Nile Grid. At present about
50 such centers, each with more than 5,000 inhabitants, and with a total
population of 470,000, are without public electricity. According to the 1978
PEWC Development Program, the Government of Sudan and PEWC have defined in
principle a development strategy for electrification of such centers in which
priority will be given to schemes (a) with outstanding economic benefits and
(b) which are identified by the Government as being of prime importance.



2.11      Several potential schemes have been identified and in 1977, DECON,
German consultants, completed a feasibility study for their electrification.
The Government of Sudan and PEWC have arranged financing on soft terms from
the Federal Republic of Germany amounting to DM 40 million to implement these
projects and six isolated urban centers are scheduled to be el-"Ctrified
during the next three years. The primary objective is to establish a basis
for economic development in the isolated centers. In addition, Denmark has
agreed to provide 150 million kroner (about US$22.0 million) on soft terms,
for improvement and expansion of power generating facilities in five pro-
vincial towns.
III. THE BLUE NILE GRID DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
BNG's Future Power Market
3.01      The economy of Sudan is predominantly based on agriculture and the
industry is mostly related to the latter. The bulk of Sudan's export earnings
is derived from agriculture (cotton and groundnuts), within which irrigation
is the most important subsector. The introduction of improved and modern
technology, which includes electrification of existing, ongoing and already
committed irrigation projects, would, amongst other things, help to increase
the agricultural output. Expansion of the existing BNG generating and
transmission/distribution facilities is expected to provide energy, 40% of
which would be used on agricultural and agro-industrial projects.
3.02      During the last few years a large number of industrial and agri-
cultural projects have been initiated in the BNG area and they are now in
various stages of development (Annexes 3.1 and 3.2). Most of these projects
are receiving financial assistance from foreign investors and bilateral or
multilateral donors. The energy and power capacity requirements of these new
projects, the planned expansion of existing industry and irrigation projects,
and the increasing demand by residential and commercial loads were the basis
for planning the BNG Development Program. Future demand was built up on the
basis of application for new connections and analysis of consumption trends
for domestic and commercial consumers, and discussions with ministries,
corporations, developers and large consumers in the case of industrial and
agricultural consumption.
3.03      The BNG total energy requirements, including transmission and
distribution losses, are expected to increase from 670 GWh in FY1978 to
1166 GWh in FY1982 or an annual average growth rate of 14.8%.  Although this
growth rate is greater than that realized during FY1974-FY1978 (about 11%,
para. 2.07), it is due to the demand that will be forthcoming from irrigation
and industrial schemes which are already under construction and it reflects
only the most conservative expectations. During 1982-1986, energy demand is
expected to increase at a lower average rate, 10% per annum, from 1166 GWh
in FY1982 to 1712 GWh in FY1986. This lower rate, which is below the rate
actually realized during FY1974-FY1978, reflects the delayed effect of the
recent slow-down in the Sudan's economy. Maximum demand is expected to
increase from 126 MW in FY1978 to 324 MW in FY1986, or an annual average
growth rate of 12.5% (Annex 2.2).



- 9 -
3.04      Specific components of aggregate demand are projected as follows:
(i)  The industrial load is expected to increase at an average
rate of 18.5% per annum, from 215 GWh in FY1978 to 424 GWh
in FY1982, as most of the major industrial developments are
expected to be commissioned during this period (para. 3.02
and Annex 3.1). This rate is to be followed by a lower
trend during the following four years, 12.5% per annum, and
the requirements would rise to 679 GWh by FY1986.
(ii)  The agricultural load is expected to be the component
of the forecast which would increase at the highest
rate during FY1978-FY1982, as three major irrigation
schemes, Rahad (cotton and groundnuts), Kenana (sugar)
and Hagar Assalaya (sugar) (Annex 3.2), have been commis-
sioned or are scheduled to be commissioned during this
period. The agricultural load will increase from 105 GWh
in FY1978 to 231 GWh in FY1982, an average growth rate of
22% per annum. It is expected to be followed by a lower
average growth rate, 10% per annum, during FY1982-FY1986
to reach a demand of 338 GWh by FY1986.
(iii)  Residential loads are expected to follow historical trends
and would increase from 206 GWh in FY1978 to 356 GWh
in FY1986 (annual average growth rate: 7%). Other loads,
which include commercial and municipal users, are expected
to increase at a constant rate of 10% per annum from 48 GWh
in FY1978 to 103 GWh in FY1986. System transmission and
distribution losses are expected to grow from 96 GWh in
FY1978 to 236 GWh in FY1986 (Annex 2.2).
A sensitivity analysis of the BNG load forecast has been carried-out and the
results are discussed in paras. 4.07 and 4.08 and annexes 4.4 and 4.5.
3.05      The structure of consumption is thus expected to change consider-
ably at the end of the period of the study. The share of the industrial
category is expected to increase from 32% of the total BNG's energy produc-
tion in FY1978 to about 40% in FY1986 while the share of the residential
category will decrease from 31% of total production in FY1978 to about 21%
in FY1986. The share of the agricultural category will increase from 16%
in FY1978 to about 20% in FY1986. BNG's total energy and power capacity
requirements in the coming years estimated on the above basis are tabulated
in Annexes 2.2 and 2.3.
BNG Development Program
3.06      Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners/Merz and McLellan of U.K., PEWC's
consultants, prepared a feasibility study for the future power development in
the BNG area through 1986. One of the main factors that affected the study
was the choice of power generating plants with the shortest construction



- 10 -
periods for the initial stages of development so that pressing needs could
be covered as soon as possible (para. 4.03). The resulting BNG Development
Program, which would meet the energy and power demand requirements for the
period 1981 through 1986, is described below and is expressed as growth of
installed capacity in Annex 2.3. Increasing demand and increasing production
capacity are shown in Annex 4.1 in monthly detail. The proposed development
program would require a total investment of LSd 170 million (US$339 million)
excluding interest during construction which is estimated at LSd 24 million
(US$48 million). The foreign exchange component (including the possible
future project) is estimated at LSd 136 million (US$273 million) (Annex
3.3). In order to facilitate the financing of the considerable foreign
exchange requirements, the BNG Development Program has been divided into two
implementation parts: the proposed project to be financed from the proceeds
of IDA credit and the Overseas Development Administration (ODA of U.K.) and
the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation (BMZ) grants and a future project,
for which financing commitments would be required to be secured during the
first half of 1982 (paras 3.13 and 6.12).
3.07      The BNG Development Program 1978-1986 comprises in the first phase
the proposed project which is summarized in para. 3.09 and described in detail
in Annex 3.5. After completion of the proposed project, a further 60-MW steam
generation capacity at the new Khartoum North thermal station may be required
to be added to the BNG system in the second phase.
Project Objectives
3.08      To meet the BNG power requirements (paras. 3.01 to 3.04), the
Government of Sudan requested Bank assistance in financing part of the foreign
exchange costs of the BNG Development Program 1978-1986. The appraisal mission
visited Sudan in August 1978 and again in early 1979 and found that the BNG
Development Program, of which the project forms a part, is suitable for
financing. The objective of the proposed IDA project is to provide additional
generating capacity and transmission extension facilities to meet the growing
demand of BNG at least cost (paras. 4.07 and 4.08). The proposed project also
provides institutional improvements and strengthening of PEWC's organization
and operation through comprehensive management and staff training programs
(paras. 5.23 and 5.24) and reform of tariff policies (paras. 6.08 and 6.09).
Project Description
3.09      The project, for which a detailed description is given in Annex 3.5,
comprises the following:
IDA Financing:
i)   Addition of the 5th and 6th 1/ hydro units (40 MW each) at
Roseires hydroelectric station and embedded parts of the
7th unit, including engineering and site supervision.
1/   Roseires hydro unit #6 does not contribute with firm power to the Blue
Nile Grid and its installation is justified only by savings in fuel
costs (it displaces the corresponding thermal generation during the
rainy seasons when hydro availability at Roseires is higher).



- 11 -
ii)   Reinforcement of the 33-kV transmission circuits between Burri
and Khartoum North, including engineering and site supervision.
iii)   Extension of the existing Khartoum North substation facilities,
including engineering and site supervision.
iv)   Engineering and site supervision for Burri Diesel Station and
the second 220-kV transmission circuit between Sennar junction
and Kilo X substation. 1/
v)   Management and staff training, including workshops, laboratories
and equipment.
BMZ Financing:
vi)   Stringing of the second 220-kV transmission circuit between
Sennar junction and Kilo X substations, excluding engineering
and site supervision.
ODA Financing:
vii)   Installation of about 40-MW diesel generating capacity at
the Burri thermal station, excluding engineering and site
supervision. 2/
viii)   Installation of about 60-MW oil-fired steam turbine plant at
the new Khartoum North thermal station, including engineering
and site supervision. 2/
Project Cost Estimates
3.10      The project cost is estimated at LSd 122 million (US$245 million
equivalent), of which LSd 98 million (US$196 million) is the foreign ex-
change component. These cost estimates exclude interest during construction
estimated at LSd 22 million (US$45 million). The project represents about
73% of the total cost of the BNG Development Program 1978-1986. The cost
estimates, which are detailed in Annex 3.4, are summarized on the followin#,
page.
1/   These consultants had been engaged according to World Bank Guidelines
and with World Bank financing just before ODA and BMZ made their
commitments.
2/   Considering the sizing of the generating units, it has been realistically
assumed that each steam and diesel unit to be installed would be of
about 30-MW and 10-MW capacity, respectively. A detailed project report,
to be used as basis for the tendering documents, will optimize the size
of the steam and the diesel units and their technical characteristics.

Basis for Cost Estimates
3.11      PEWC consultants prepared the cost estimates on the basis of recent
quotations from manufacturers and contractor's offers for similar equipment
and works. The appraisal mission reviewed and updated the consultant's
estimates. The base costs are at July 1979 price levels. Physical contingen-
cies have been calculated at a rate of 15% of base costs on all project
components except for Roseires hydroelectric unit where 10% was used for
electrical and mechanical works. Price contingencies have been calculated
using the following annual escalation rates and rounded to the nearest
thousand:
Percent (%)
1979    1980    1981    1982    1983-1986
Local Products and Services        18       14      11        9         8
Foreign Products and Services       9        8       7        6         6
Engineering and site supervision estimates have been based on an average
man-month rate of LSd 3,500 (US$7,000) which includes consultant's salaries,
overhead, travelling, benefits and profit. 1/ To minimize the risks of cost
overruns on the main IDA-financed components, bids for the Roseires hydro
units were received in recent weeks and they are within cost estimates shown
in this report.
3.12      The high percentage of foreign exchange costs (about 80%) is due to
the fact that the local contribution would be limited to labor, land and some
materials for civil works (lumber for formwork, sand, etc.). The Government
of Sudan has indicated that it would exempt the project imports from duties
and taxes (para. 6.15).
Financing Plan
3.13      The financing requirements for the project are estimated at US$290
million, which includes a foreign currency cost of US$196 million and interest
during construction (IDC) of US$45 million which together add up to 83% of
the total requirement. The financing plan proposed for the project includes
an IDA credit of US$65 million which would meet 22% of the total financing
requirements and a proposed Overseas Development Administration of U.K. (ODA)
grant to cover US$114 million equivalent or 39%, and an expected grant of
US$25 million equivalent or 9% from the Ministry of Economic Cooperation of
1/   450 man-months were estimated to be required for engineering and site
supervision services of Roseires hydro unit #5 and an additional
260 man-months for the engineering and site supervision of the 220-kV
transmission circuit Sennar-Kilo X, reinforcement of the 33-kV circuit
Burri-Khartoum North and extension of Burri diesel station.



- 14 -
Federal Republic of Germany (BMZ). The BMZ grant would finance US$17 million
of foreign exchange cost and US$8 million of local cost. The entire amount of
IDC, though calculated mainly on foreign currency requirements of the project
would be payable in local currency since the foreign financing will be avail-
able for the project on soft term credit or grant basis and the Government
will then relend these funds to PEWC on commercial terms. IDC of US$45
million or 16% will be treated as the Government's contribution, and the
remaining local costs of US$41 million or 14% of the total financing require-
ments would be met from PEWC's internal cash generation. The financing plan
is summarized in the following table:

Engineering and Construction Schedule
3.14      For the components to be financed with the proceeds of the proposed
IDA credit, PEWC will engage engineering consultants in accordance with Bank
guidelines, whose qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employ-
ment are satisfactory to the Associaton (para. 7.03a). In addition PEWC shall
employ consultants to coordinate the designs and construction of different
components of the project. PEWC technical staff will participate, whenever
possible, in the design and supervision of the project through staff seconded
to the consultants for training. PEWC had already been provided by the
Association with an advance of US$1 million from the Project Preparation
Facility (para. 6.14) to engage consultants to complete a major part of the
bidding process before Board presentation of the proposed credit. Except for
the engineering consultants for Burri diesel station thus financed, engineer-
ing consultants for the IDA and BMZ components will be appointed in accord-
ance with ODA and BMZ guidelines. Bids for the major components of the
project proposed to be financed by IDA were received in mid-March, 1980 and
are within estimates.
3.15      No major construction problems are foreseen as the works represent
extensions to existing facilities (Roseires and Burri stations, Sennar-Kilo X
and Burri-Khartoum transmission circuits). The implementation schedule aims
for commissioning the first four 10-MW diesel units at two-month intervals
starting August 1982; Burri-Khartoum North transmission circuit in September
1981; the fifth hydroelectric unit at Roseires station and the 220-kV trans-
mission circuit in July 1983, the Khartoum North steam power plant and the
extension of Khartoum North substation are scheduled to be commissioned in
March 1983 (Annexes 3.6 and 3.7). The target dates are achievable provided
financing arrangements are completed on time. The various components of the
training program would be implemented during the period 1980-1983 as programmed
in the training proposal (paras. 5.23, 5.24 and Annex 3.7).

Procurement
3.16      All contracts with estimated cost exceeding US$100,000 for civil
works and for the supply and installation of material and equipment to be
financed with funds from the proposed IDA credit will be awarded under
international cumpetitive bidding procedures in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines on procurement. Competitive bidding in accordance with other
procedures, such as international and local shopping satisfactory to the Bank
will be appropriate for a few contracts not exceeding US$100,000. Total
expenditures under such procedures would not exceed US$500,000. All equipment
and material would be imported as there are no local manufacturers in this
specialized field.
Disbursements
3.17      Funds from the proposed IDA credit would be applied to the payment
of the foreign exchange expenditure of:
-    installation of Roseires hydro units 5 and 6 and
embedded parts of unit 7 at Roseires power plant;
-    reinforcement of the 33-kV transmission circuits between
Burri and Khartoum North;
-    extension of the existing Khartoum North substation
facilities;
-    consulting services only for Burri diesel station and
for the second 220-kV transmission circuit between
Sennar junction and Kilo X substation;
-    management and staff training program; and
-    refunding of Project Preparation Facility advance.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1985. Annex 3.8
gives an estimated disbursement schedule.
Monitoring
3.18      Monitoring standards will be established to achieve efficient
implementation of the project and to help improve the performance of PEWC.
Major project components to be monitored against target dates are the tender-
ing, contract awards, construction stages and the commissioning of Burri
diesel plant and Roseires hydro station. The training program and training
activities will be checked and reviewed against target dates to be prepared
by PEWC and reviewed by the Association. Financial and management monitoring
will be concentrated on (a) rate of return and review of tariffs; (b) collec-
tion of revenues; (c) project costs and financing; (d) progress in reducing
the staff; and (e) progress in introduction of quarterly financial statements
and management reports. PEWC has agreed to the Association's completion
report requirements. Agreed project monitoring guidelines are given in
Annex 3.7.

Environment
3.19      The extensions of the existing Roseires hydroelectric and Burri
diesel power stations and the expansion of the existing transmission system
are not expected to have an adverse impact on the environment. Steam power
plant will be designed to keep the effects of stock gases, condenser,
cooling and fuel systems and other types of waste within the normally
accepted levels.
IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Technical Justification
4.01      The Blue Nile Grid's present power market (para. 2.07) and PEWC's
existing facilities (paras. 2.03 and 2.04 and Annex 2.1) have been described
in Chapter 2. It was shown that the BNG's present demand is greater than its
available supply (para. 2.05) and it will remain so, even after commissioning
of the ongoing construction of the Power II Project at Roseires and Burri
diesel power stations (para. 2.04) and after increasing the existing thermal
capacity by rehabilitating the existing steam units at Burri (para. 5.17 and
Annex 2.1). If the already, or nearly, completed industrial and agricultural
projects are not to remain idle, power generating facilities must be installed
in the BNG as early as possible.
4.02      The consultants' feasibility study for the future power develop-
ment of the BNG (para. 3.06) was based on a careful analysis of (a) the
existing facilities; (b) the present power market situation; (c) expected
demand for power and energy; and (d) the several alternatives of plant addi-
tion to meet the BNG requirements.
Alternative Expansion Programs
4.03      The urgent need for new power facilities (para. 4.01) limits the
choices in the earlier stages of the development program to the installation
of diesel or gas turbine units at Burri and/or Kilo X stations and the
extension of the existing Roseires hydroelectric station. Gas turbine plant,
which requires distilled fuel (gas oil) for its operation, was eliminated as
analysis proved its poor economy in comparison with diesel sets which can use
part of the residual fuel oil that Sudan's energy market cannot absorb (para.
1.05). Although space is available for three additional sets at Roseires
power station, restriction of water during the period of low reservoir levels
(paras. 2.05 and 4.05) limits the addition to two units (5th and 6th).
Construction of embedded parts of a third unit (7th) is justified on technical
grounds and on grounds of economy of expenditure (Annex 4.6).
4.04      The additional possibilities for later stages would be limited to
oil-based steam turbine plants as further hydro-development would require
heightening of Roseires dam or development of new sites, both of which are
very long-term propositions (para. 1.02).



- 1 7 -
4.05      Four alternative programs of power plant additions were developed
based on the concepts given in the previous paragraphs (4.02 through 4.04)
together with the realistically estimated construction period for each type
of plant considered. All programs are designed to meet the BNG's energy and
power requirements during the period considered in the study and they are
described below:
a)   All Thermal Program:  This alternative consists of the
addition of about 60 MW diesel generating capacity at
Burri station, each set of about 10-MW 1/ rated capacity,
to be commissioned at two-month intervals starting
August 1982. This stage would be followed by the
installation of four steam turbine-driven generators,
each of about 30-MW rated capacity, 1/ to be commissioned
at one-year intervals starting March 1983. It also
includes associated transmission extensions. As a vari-
ation of this alternative, the 6 x 10-MW diesel units of
the program were replaced either by 3 x 20-MW diesel units
or 4 x 15-MW diesel units placing each unit at suitable
intervals. The rest of the program (4 steam units)
remained unchanged.
b)   Hydro-Thermal Program:  This alternative comprises the
installation of 40 MW diesel generating capacity at Burri
station, each set of about 10-MW 1/ rated capacity, to
be commissioned at two-month intervals starting August 1983.
The addition of the 5th and 6th 2/ hydro-generators at
Roseires power station would be commissioned in July 1983
and in December 1983, respectively. During the perlod
of low reservoir levels, March through June, as Roseires
station's power and energy output is reduced to about 75%
and 35% respectively, unit 5's useful power and energy
capacity is substantially reduced and unit 6 makes no
contrlbution. This program also includes the installation
of four steam turbine-driven generators, each of 30-MW
capacity, to be commissioned at one-year intervals starting
March 1983, and associated transmission facilities (Annex
4.1). As a variation of this alternative, the 4 x 10-MW
diesel units of the program were replaced either by 2 x 20-MW
diesel units or 3 x 15-MW diesel units placing each unit at
suitable lntervals. The rest of the program (hydro and
steam units) remained unchanged.
1/   A detailed project report to be used as basis for the tendering documents,
will optimize the diesel's size and other technical characteristics.
2/   Installation of unit 6 at Roseires is justified in terms of fuel cost
savings (by displacing use of oil-burning plant) during the rainy season
when hydro generation availability is higher (Annex 4.6).

Power and Energy Allocations
4.06      System simulation studies were conducted for monthly power and
energy allocations during dry and medium water year conditions for all
alternative sclutions taking into account existing and proposed BNG's hydro-
thermal generation plant capability. (Annex 4.1 illustrates power avail-
ability and requirements and Annexes 4.2 and 4.3 illustrate the energy
allocations).
Least Cost Solution
4.07      Comparison of the net present capital and operating economic 1/
costs of the alternatives demonstrates that the recommended Hydro/Thermal
Program is the least cost solution at discount rates of up to 100%, which
is substantially higher than the opportunity cost of capital in the Sudan,
estimated at 12% in real terms. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out
to evaluate the effects of (a) variation in capital costs, (b) variation in
fuel costs and (c) lower load growth. Capital cost variations of + 10% and
fuel cost variations of + 25% were assumed and the selected program remains
the least cost solution at discount rates of up to 100% (Annex 4.4 gives the
detailed cost streams and assumptions on which they are based). Lower load
growth has been assumed for the period covered by the study (10% as compared
with 12.5% "probable" average load growth) and it is demonstrated that the
selected program is the least cost solution at discount rates of up to 100%.
Return on Investment
4.08      The rate of return 2/ of the proposed BNG Development Program is
estimated at approximately 16%. The rate of return would drop to about 12%,
if costs were 10% higher than estimated and expected revenues 10% lower
(Annex 4.5 gives the detailed cost streams and assumptions on which they are
based). However, it is unlikely that costs would be higher, as estimates are
based on recent experience and are relatively high. Furthermore the demand
growth estimate is already conservative.
Risks
4.09      The physical risks of the BNG Development Program are negligible.
Roseires hydroelectric power plant extension should not pose any significant
risks since major civil works have been completed and only installation
1/   In calculating economic costs shadow prices (LSd 1 = US$1.75) were
used for valuing all imported inputs (foreign exchange component)
and all direct taxes were omitted (para. 3.12).
2/   Defined as the discount rate which equalizes the present worth of the
associated economic net cost streams, including capital and operating
costs but excluding taxes, and the present worth of the associated
expected revenues obtained over its lifetime. The latter is based on
tariff levels after PEWC had increased them (paras. 6.01 and 7.03(g)).



- 19 -
of equipment and minor civil works would be required. Additions to Burri
power plant would involve extension of existing simple civil works and in-
stallation of equipment. The Khartoum steam power plant is expected to be
simpler than most thermal plants since it will include relatively low pressure
oil-fired steam units. Furthermore, cooling water is readily available from
the Nile in sufficient quantities. Foundations and site investigation would
be the only components which will require careful study.
4.10      Other risks related to timely and efficient implementation of the
proposed project are: (a) timely disbursements of foreign currency financing;
(b) shortage of local funds if PEWC's financial viability is not maintained;
(c) institutional and management weaknesses; and (d) delays in tender evalua-
tions and in opening of letters of credit for supply of equipment and mate-
rials. Steps proposed to minimize these risks are described in the following
paragraphs.
4.11      Commitment by other financing agencies of foreign currency funds
required for the project would be a condition of effectiveness for the pro-
posed credit (paras. 6.14 and 7.04b).
4.12      To ensure that PEWC is able to meet its local currency requirements
for operations, debt service and capital expenditure, PEWC has revised its
tariffs so that it should earn a reasonable return on its fixed assets (paras.
6.09 and 7.02g) and would be required to continue to do so in the future
(paras 6.01 and 7.02b).
4.13      The reconstitution of PEWC's Board of Directors in August 1978
(paras 5.04 to 5.08) should help correct a major institutional weakness by
separating policy-making from operational functions. PEWC's management
will be strengthened by (a) delegation of adequate authority to the General
Manager (para. 5.07); (b) a comprehensive training program for all levels
of management (para. 5.24); and (c) institution of a system of management
reporting to provide data for monitoring and control of PEWC's operations
and activities.
4.14      The Government has agreed to streamline the procedures of the
Ministry of Finance for tender evaluation and of the Bank of Sudan for opening
letters of credit which in the past have delayed project implementation.
These new procedures were reviewed by the Association, and their implementa-
tion will be monitored by the Association (paras. 5.17 and 7.01a).
V. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
5.01      The Government of Sudan would be the borrower, while the proceeds
of the proposed credit would be applied to expenditures on the project through
the Public Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC). The Bank group's past
operations in the power sector in the Sudan and a review of PEWC's performance
with regard to those operations are described briefly at the end of this
chapter.



- 20 -
Background
5.02      PEWC's origin goes back to 1908 when a small generating unit was
installed at Burri by a British company to provide electricity to an ice
factory.  Subsequently in 1925 a group of British companies neotiated an
agreement to provide electricity and water supply services in the cities of
Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman by forming the Sudan Light and Power
Company (SLPC) to provide capital, technical advice and management, while
ownership of the assets was vested with the Government. Concurrently with
the work of SLPC, the Public Works Department (PWD) developed electricity and
water supply in other towns on a smaller scale. SLPC's management was nation-
alized a few years before Sudan became a sovereign state in 1956, and the
Central Electricity and Water Administration (CEWA) was formed in 1959 as a
government department, directly responsible to a Minister, to take over SLPC's
functions. In 1966 an autonomous entity, the Central Electricity and Water
Corporation (CEWC) was established as a statutory corporation to take over
CEWA's functions. CEWC took over the operation of all PWD installations in
1971.
5.03      CEWC's operations were reasonably satisfactory until 1969 when its
Board of Directors was abolished by the Government and the powers of the
corporation were vested in the Minister. The standard of operations steadily
deteriorated after this change as many of the important management and opera-
tional decisions could not be made promptly due to the Minister's preoccupa-
tion elsewhere. Collection of electricity and water supply billing had fallen
more than eight months into arrears by 1974 (para. 5.19) and power breakdowns
due to technical difficulties were becoming increasingly frequent. In an
effort to rectify the situation an autonomous Board of Directors was reestab-
lished with the Bank's advice through an Act in 1975 which changed the cor-
poration's name to the Public Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC). Under
that Act, the Board of Directors comprised the general manager, the deputy
general manager, PEWC's departmental managers, three representatives of PEWC
staff unions and two members from outside. This Board composition proved to
be ineffective partly because, in the absence of firm leadership and guidance
by the general manager, the departmental managers who were members of the
Board perceived themselves to be outside the authority of PEWC management and
not subject to its discipline. This gave rise to a situation in which the
Board members could not agree on even matters of staff appointments, transfers
and promotions and these matters, with conflicting accounts and recommenda-
tions of individual Board members, reached the Minister for decision. The
issues were then made subjects of long, and mostly inconclusive, deliberations
of committees appointed to investigate and report on them. As a result, key
staff positions remained vacant for years and service standards improved only
slightly in comparison with 1974 (paras. 5.15 and 5.17).
PEWC Act of 1978
5.04      A new PEWC Act in August 1978 changed the composition of the Board.
The 15-member Board of Directors is headed by a nominee of the President of
the Republic as the Chairman (at present, the Minister of Presidential Affairs),



- 21 -
and includes the undersecretaries of the Ministries of Finance and National
Economy, National Planning, Industries, Irrigation; a representative of
the Presidency of the Republic; a representative of the People's Local Gov-
ernment; five members representing trade unions and syndicate organizations;
and two members appointed by the President of the Republic. The only member
representing PEWC's management on the Board is the General Manager of PEWC.
Except under special circumstances, the Board is required to meet once every
three months and is expected particularly to review PEWC's activities relating
to electricity and water supply services in the various regions of the country
and to submit reports and proposals thereon to the President of the Republic.
5.05      The 1978 Act places PEWC under the direct supervision of the
President or a person designated by him and provides (as did the 1975 Act)
the legal framework for autonomy of administration and the authority to
plan, develop and operate an efficient and financially viable electricity
and water supply system in the country. The Act requires the General Manager
to submit annual budget estimates for approval to the Board, the latter to
submit the estimates to the President of the Republic for approval. The Act
also requires the General Manager to submit tariff proposals for electricity
and water supply to the Board of Directors which would approve the tariffs
after consultation with the Minister of Finance and National Economy.
5.06      The new Act, unlike its predecessor, does not include any of the
departmental managers of PEWC as members of the Board of Directors which
should help in separation of the policy-making function from that of operation
and thus remove the conflict which, in the past, made both these functions
virtually inoperative (para. 5.03). On the other hand, with 15 members the
Board may prove to be unwieldy. The various ministries represented on the
Board are related to PEWC's functions and could help provide coordination
between PEWC's planning and operation and the Government's policies as well
as developments in the related sectors. Of the two outside members, one is a
prominent businessman in the private sector and a major electricity and water
consumer, and the other is an engineer. The interval of three months between
Board meetings could prove too long at times; the Act, however, provides for
calling meetings at shorter intervals.
5.07      The Board is authorized under the new Act to delegate any of its
powers to the General Manager, and it has done so to enable him to manage
PEWC's activities effectively, particularly in respect of staff appointments,
transfers and promotions, and procurement (para. 7.03b).
5.08      The new Act does not change PEWC's responsibility for both the
electricity and urban water supply operations in the Sudan. The Government
has had under its consideration a proposal to separate the water and electri-
city operations of PEWC. This, in the past, has given rise to uncertainty
among both the staff and management of PEWC regarding the future of the
organization of water supply operations, with the result that the water
supply planning and operation have received less than adequate attention by
the Board, the management and the staff of PEWC. To dispel this atmosphere
of uncertainty, the Government decided that the possibility of separation of



- 22 -
water supply operations from PEWC would be considered only after operation of
PEWC's water department had been brought to an acceptable level of efficiency
and reliability. The Association should go along with this approach since
each of the two alternatives, of separate organizations or a single organiza-
tion for electricity and water supply operations, has both advantages and
disadvantages; and since the Association is involved in both power and water
supply sectors, its efforts in helping to achieve institutional and operational
improvements would be concentrated on one institution in the context of both
the sectors. Preparation for the development of PEWC's water supply expansion
is progressing with the assistance of consultants financed under a technical
assistance project in which IDA is participating (Credit 614-SU). Training
needs of the water supply staff together with other staff of PEWC are proposed
to be included in the project (para. 5.24).
Management and Staff
5.09       The present general manager of PEWC was appointed in January 1977.
The General Manager attributed lack of operational and administrative effi-
ciency and discipline to insufficient authority having been given to PEWC in
the past to appoint, remove, transfer or discipline its staff (para. 5.10),
even though the PEWC Act of 1975 provided these powers to the PEWC Board of
Directors, subject to directives of a general nature which the Minister was
authorized to issue. The President informed the Bank appraisal mission that
PEWC would be allowed to operate with full autonomy in administrative and
personnel matters after enactment of the PEWC Act of 1978. Accordingly,
PEWC's board of directors has delegated adequate powers to the general
manager to deal with these matters.
5.10      The organizational structure of PEWC is shown in Annex 5.1.  PEWC's
main departments are Electricity, Water, Administration, Regions, Commercial,
Supplies and Finance. Almost the entire organization operates at inadequate
levels of efficiency, reliability and discipline. The staff at practically
all levels lacks motivation. Coordination between different departments of
PEWC, in fact even within departments, is often lacking. Although some basic
statistics are recorded, very little work is done on matching, summarizing,
comparing, analyzing and reporting the results. The departmental managers,
the General Manager, the Board of Directors and the Government receive very
little information relating to the operations of the corporation. The project
therefore contains a substantial training component which would include an
elaborate program designed to increase management skills throughout PEWC.
Details of the training component are given in paragraphs 5.23 and 5.24. It
is important to ensure that PEWC is under sound management at all times and
is capable of achieving an efficient standard of operation. Confirmation was
obtained during negotiations that PEWC shall at all times employ appropriately
qualified and experienced staff including the positions of Directors of
Electricity, Water and Finance (para. 7.03c).
5.11      PEWC is grossly overstaffed, particularly in the unskilled category.
Electricity and water operations jointly have about 14,600 employees, i.e.
one for every 23 consumers or meters. Although this proportion in a well-run
utility in North America would be between 100 and 200 active meters per



- 23 -
employee, a realistic initial objective for PEWC to achieve would perhaps be
between 35 and 40 active meters per employee, 1/ considering the conditions
in the Sudan where staff training needs are considerable, operations are
scattered, and automation in operation is practicable for fewer applications.
During the negotiations PEWC agreed that it will not engage additional non-
technical, unclassified staff until after PEWC has achieved a proportion of
more than 40 active meters per employee (para. 7.03c).
Management Consultants
5.12      PEWC has employed consultants in the past to assist in improving
its performance through better systems and procedures and staff training.
Between 1966 and 1973 PEWC employed Middle West Service Company (MWSC) of
Chicago as management consultants. PEWC and the Association were dissatis-
fied with the performance of MWSC and their services were terminated in
1973. Since 1973, PEWC has employed Electricity Council of United Kingdom
(ECUK) and its consultancy organization British Electricity International
(BEI) to help improve and reorganize PEWC's electricity operations, review
its organizational structure, prepare job specifications for various posi-
tions, staff training, power market survey, annual electricity development
plan, reorganization of the water supply operations, and financial control
and procedures.
5.13      BEI has made a number of recommendations for the reorganization of
PEWC and for improvement of its policies, procedures and practices. Although
PEWC has accepted many of the recommendations relating to electricity oper-
ations, reorganization of electricity and commercial departments and job
specifications for their staff, the measures necessary to implement them have
either not been initiated by PEWC or have not taken full effect, mainly due
to PEWC's management problems (para. 5.10).
5.14      While the assistance provided by BEI in technical matters, organi-
zational improvement and staff training has been useful, the quality of their
assistance in improving PEWC's financial management, systems, procedures and
reporting has been unsatisfactory. BEI's financial experts assigned to PEWC
did not prove to be of the required caliber and they devoted much of their
time to routine bookkeeping and clerical work rather than analyzing the
systems, procedures and information requirements for financial control and
planning. In view of this, PEWC with the Association's concurrence suspended
those financial experts' visits to Sudan but continued to use BEI to arrange
training abroad for PEWC's financial staff.
5.15      PEWC should now concentrate on making use of the work done in the
past by the management consultants rather than continuing to employ them for
general management studies, particularly since the management consultants'
involvement has so far neither been successful in achieving improvements
in effectiveness and control at senior and middle management levels, nor in
1/   Number of active meters per employee in some other countries in
East Africa are: Kenya 46, Mauritius 74.

instituting a system of internal management reporting and thereby helping to
ensure accountability and departmental coordination in PEWC. The proposed
management training (paras. 5.10 and 5.24) is expected to help achieve these
objectives.
Operations and Maintenance
5.16      Economic operation of the BNG system depends to a large extent on
the maximum utilization of Roseires hydroelectric power plant. The main
problems that have affected the operation of this station since commissioning
are: (a) siltation of water intakes and blocking of trash-screens; (b) lack
of proper maintenance and operational schedules of power plant; and (c) key
technical positions at Roseires and in the electricity department remaining
vacant over the last two years. Improvements were achieved in operational and
maintenance procedures during 1976-1977 when operation of Roseires was under
the supervision of an expatriate expert. PEWC recognizes the nececessity to
continue to employ an expert at the station and has initiated steps to appoint
an expert for the Roseires station (para. 7.03d). PEWC has confirmed that
almost all the senior positions which had remained vacant in the past have now
been filled.
5.17      Existing thermal plant output is severely restricted due to lack
of spare parts for cooling systems, boilers and diesel engines. Delays and
difficulties in opening letters of credit and non-availability of foreign
exchange are the main causes of the problems. To improve this situation the
Government of Sudan is taking steps to streamline procedures followed by
the Bank of Sudan for opening letters of credit, and those followed by the
Ministry of Finance for review of tender evaluations (para. 7.01a). ODA
has offered to provide financing for purchase of spare parts to upgrade the
existing thermal plant at Burri, and is considering PEWC's request for supply
of spare parts worth about US$9 million.
5.18      Since the fuel requirement of the thermal-power plant represents
about 10% of Sudan's total fuel use, PEWC has made efforts to economize on
fuel consumption by improving the use of hydro-generation. In spite of the
difficulties mentioned in para. 5.16, BNG system's hydroelectric generation
increased to 85% of its total generation in 1977/78 as compared with 78% in
1975/1976.
Accounting and Audit
5.19      During appraisal of the first two power projects (Loan 522-SU
and Credit 564-SU) in 1967 and 1974 respectively, considerable difficulties
were experienced in evaluating PEWC's finances. These were (i) lack of
reliable and consistent information on past performance; (ii) long delays in
closing the books of account; and (iii) billing problems caused in part by
equipment failures. PEWC has made considerable improvement in the availability
of basic accounting information since 1975 but much further improvement is
needed in the availability, accuracy and quality of information. Billing
difficulties and the resulting delayed collection of revenue, however,
continue. However, a new computer with greater capacity than the previous
one is in operation which should help reduce the level of accounts receivable.



- 25 -
PEWC also had difficulty in collection of its dues from the Government
departments and agencies. Of the net amount due to PEWC from the government
agencies totalling about LSd 2 million as on June 30, 1979, the Government
has already paid LSd 0.9 million to PEWC and agreed to pay the balance in
monthly installments from March to June 1980. Moreover, PEWC and the Govern-
ment have established suitable procedures so that these dues are paid promptly
in the future (para. 7.02a).
5.20      PEWC's accounts are decentralized and are maintained at its various
area offices. At the head office in Khartoum, only the accounts of that
office are kept. The regional offices do not send periodic accounts, income
statements, balance sheets or other reports to Khartoum more often than once
every year after the close of financial year. PEWC has agreed that accounting
information and management reports would be prepared in respect of all of
PEWC's regional offices and consolidated with the head office accounts no less
frequently than at quarterly intervals starting from July 1, 1980 (para. 7.03e).
5.21      PEWC's external auditors are appointed by the Auditor General of
the Sudan, generally well after the closing of PEWC's accounts and consequently
the auditors' report becomes available long thereafter. The Association
has written to the Auditor General about this delay. Assurances were obtained
that either the Auditor-General would carry out the audits or would appoint
external auditors acceptable to the Association no later than six months
before the end of each financial year (para. 7.01b).
5.22      PEWC's accounts are audited annually by a Sudanese firm, Mohamed
Abdel Latif & Co. The quality of this firm's reports is not fully adequate:
both the audited accounts and the auditors' report thereon contain errors
and unverified figures. The Association has pointed out these discrepancies
to the auditors; the latter have taken note and promised to improve their
reporting standards. The auditors' performance should be closely monitored
by future supervision missions to determine if the quality of their reports
improves to an acceptable level.
Training
5.23      PEWC maintains two levels of training programs for its staff:  (a)
technical personnel, in which every year several engineers are sent abroad for
practical and academic training for periods ranging from 1 to 2 years. It
also sponsors full-time students in universities abroad; (b) skilled workers
who attend an apprenticeship program which includes two years of theoretical
training and two years of on-the-job training.
5.24      As the present programs do not fulfill satisfactorily PEWC's re-
quirements, PEWC requested the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB) to
prepare a detailed training and development plan for PEWC's technical staff.
PEWC has recently forwarded to IDA ESB's training proposals which include:
(a) a comprehensive training program covering all categories of technical
staff, and (b) extension of the existing training facilities to include
workshops, laboratory, lecture rooms and electrical and lecture rooms and
electrical and mechanical training equipment. The proposals are satisfactory



- 26 -
and, in view of PEWC's expanding training requirements, it is intended to
include these proposals as a part of the training component to be financed by
the proposed IDA credit. The more complex training component will deal with
management training at all levels, from foreman to general manager. Part of
the training may be conducted through courses and seminars, but proposals
which emphasize in-house training are being sought. PEWC will provide
detailed proposals for IDA's approval by July 1, 1980 (para. 7.03 (f) and
Annex 3.5).
Insurance
5.25      PEWC has satisfactory insurance coverage through companies which
insure its plant and equipment against the risks of machinery breakdown,
explosion and collapse of boilers, fire, lighting and transit.
Review of PEWC's Performance in Bank-Financed Projects
5.26      In 1961, the Bank Group provided US$32.5 million to the Government
of Sudan through Loan 284-SU and Credit 2-SU to assist in the financing of
Roseires irrigation project and, in 1963, a further US$6.3 million to
cover the construction of the substructure and related works of the Roseires
dam power station. The Bank made its first loan, 522-SU, to PEWC in 1967 to
finance the installation of the first three 30-MW generating sets at the
Roseires dam, a 15-MW gas turbine, and complementary transmission facilities.
The power stations have been in operation since 1971. The original amount
of the loan of US$24 million was subsequently reduce to US$19 million due to
savings on construction of transmission lines. In 1975 IDA provided to the
Government a US$23 million credit, 564-SU, which was relent to PEWC to help
finance a fourth generating set (42 MW) at Roseires dam, three 5-MW diesel
generators at Burri thermal station in Khartoum, complementary transmission
system extensions, a 5-MW diesel generator at Juba power station, Juba dis-
tribution system improvements and consultants' services for long-term planning
studies and for providing assistance to improve PEWC's management and tech-
nical operations. All the project components are scheduled to be commissioned
in 1980 and 1981.
5.27      The first power project, financed by IBRD Loan 522-SU and completed
in 1971, was the subject of a Project Performance Audit Report (No. 1169)
dated May 13, 1976. The conclusions of that report pointed up the difficul-
ties of carrying out a large and sophisticated program of expansion and, at
the same time, attempting to overhaul and improve the financial management of
a weak institution. These difficulties related to planning and implementation
of the project and developing the borrower's technical and managerial compe-
tence, and resulted in delays of over a year in completion of the project and
failure of efforts for institutional improvement.
5.28      The second power project, financed by IDA Credit 564-SU, has
encountered similar difficulties as the first project, particularly in project
implementation and institutional reform. Some positive results have been
achieved, however, in preparing market studies, development planning and
financial management; and a framework has been provided by BEI for imple-
mentation by PEWC in respect of job specifications and technical operations
manuals.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
6.01      Since 1975, PEWC has not met the rate of return covenant of IDA
Credit 564-SU which requires that PEWC should earn a minimum of 8% annual
net operating income on average revalued net fixed assets on its electricity
operations and 4% on its water supply operations. Additionally, in incurring
some recent long-term debts PEWC has marginally contravened the debt coverage
requirement of a ratio of 1.5:1, internal cash generation to debt service.
The unsatisfactory financial performance was brought about by rapid increases
in operating costs due principally to escalation of wages and material costs
which outstripped revenues generated with tariff increases averaging about
30% for electricity and 34% for water supply which were put into effect in
September 1975. PEWC's financial position is expected to improve, however,
after increases of 100% in electricity tariffs and 200% in water supply
tariffs which it implemented effective July 1, 1979 (para. 6.09). To help
ensure financial viability of PEWC, the covenants of Credit 564-SU relating
to rate of return and debt service coverage have been repeated in the
proposed credit (para. 7.02b).
Financial Position and Past Operating Results
6.02      PEWC's balance sheets as of June 30, 1976, 1977 and 1978 indicate
that its cash position and current ratio during these years has been satisfac-
tory. This was principally due to (a) a grant of LSd 3.32 million from the
Saudi Arabian Government to PEWC to help improve its electric supply service;
(b) the Government taking over PEWC's liability for a Bank of Sudan loan of
LSd 8.25 million and converting it into a grant; and (c) the Government taking
over an Italian loan of LSd 0.73 million utilized by PEWC in exchange for an
equity interest. PEWC's financial position on June 30, 1978 is summarized
on the following page and shown in detail in Annex 6.1.

6.03      The accounts receivable on June 30, 1978 after providing for doubt-
ful accounts are equivalent to about 158 days' sales revenue which indicates
an unsatisfactory situation in billing and collections; however, this level
represents an improvement over 232 days on June 30, 1976 but no significant
improvement over 160 days on June 30, 1977 (para. 5.19).
6.04      PEWC's debt/equity ratio on June 30, 1978 was 15:85, indicating
that it is conservatively capitalized. PEWC's equity capital represents the
net value of electricity and water supply assets contributed by SLPC and PWD
since 1971, the grants described in para. 6.02, advances made by the Govern-
ment, retained earnings and the net increase due to revaluation of fixed
assets.

6.06      After the implementation of electricity and water tariff increases
averaging about 30% and 34% respectively in September 1975, it was expected
that the higher revenues generated would help restore PEWC's financial viabil-
ity; but despite these increases PEWC's electricity operations during the two
years ended June 30, 1978 generated funds sufficient to finance only about
19% of the electricity development program. Water supply operations did not
generate any funds during these two years to finance the water supply develop-
ment program and, in fact, the operating costs had to be subsidized by the



- 30 -
Government to the extent of some LSd 1.3 million. Energy sales during these
two years were 11% and 5% below the estimates made during the appraisal of
Power II Project; electricity sales revenue, however, was only 3% more in
FY1977 and 9% more than appraisal estimate in FY1978 due to higher tariff
increases thaci assumed for the estimates. Operating expenses were 44% and
39% higher than appraisal estimates in FY1977 and FY1978 mainly because the
actual operating expenses, other than fuel and depreciation, increased at
well above the annual rate of increase of 8% assumed at appraisal to cover
both the expanded volume of operations and the price escalation whereas even
apart from growth in volume of operations, actual inflation in Sudan was 17%
in FY1978, 25% in FY1979 and is expected to be 27% in FY1980. The rate of
return for electricity was 3.2% and 6% for FY1977 and FY1978 respectively,
compared with the appraisal estimate of 11.6% and 10.1% and the covenanted
minimum rate of 8% under the IDA Credit 564-SU.
6.07      Performance in water supply operations of PEWC also proved much
below the expectations at appraisal of Power II Project. Water sales volume
in FY1977 and FY1978 was 21% and 24% below, sales revenue 22% and 36% lower,
and operating expenses 9% and 19% higher due to greater increases than assumed
at appraisal (para. 6.06). The rate of return for water supply was minus 5.4%
and minus 10.5% for the two years, compared with the appraisal estimate of 3%
and 6% and the covenanted minimum rate of 4% under the IDA Credit 564-SU.
Tariffs
6.08      In 1974 the Bank carried out a detailed study in which a tariff
structure was formulated reflecting the economic cost of supplying energy to
different consumer categories. A year later, PEWC's consultant (R. Dixon of
U.K. North Eastern Electricity Board) carried out a follow-up study mainly to
bring it up to date to implement the Bank's study. PEWC has attempted to
implement cost-reflecting tariffs with seasonal and time-of-the-day features,
based on the above mentioned studies. There is also an attempt to reflect
regional differences in the cost of energy supply (mainly due to transport
and regional cost differences in fuel).
6.09      PEWC's present electricity and water supply tariffs which were put
into effect on July 1, 1979 are adequate to provide sufficient funds to
meet its requirements of operating expenses, debt service and normal capital
expenditure, and to meet the rate of return covenant of IDA Credit 564-SU
relating to electricity and water operations. Electricity and water tariffs
in the Sedan average LSd 0.05 or US cents 10 per kWh and LSd 0.20 or US cents
40 per m respectively; and are among the highest in Africa. 1/
1/   Electricity tariffs for some other East African countries in US cents
per kWh are:  Botswana 3; Kenya 5; Malawi 5; Mauritius 9; Swaziland 3;
Tanzania 6. Water supply tariffs in US cents per m are: Gaborone,
Botswana 28; Mombasa, Kenya 48; Nairobi, Kenya 42; Lesotho 31;
Antananarivo, Madagascar 13; Blantyre, Malawi 29; Mogadishu, Somalia
32; Swaziland 32; Zaire 27.

Future Financial Position and Operations
6.10      Projected balance sheets shows that between June 30, 1980 to 1986
current assets/current liabilities ratio varies between 4.3 and 8.0 which
are high values in part resulting from unusually large amounts tied up in
receivables and inventories. Targets have been set for reducing the receiv-
ables and progress in achieving the targets would be monitored (Annex 3.8).
Inventories, however, are expected to remain at high levels in view of major
expansion works being undertaken, and unusually long lead time required in
Sudan for import of material due to port and transportation bottlenecks. The
debt/equity ratio will increase from 24/76 for FY1979 to 43/57 for FY1984 and
40/60 for FY1986, which is within acceptable limits.
6.11      PEWC's electricity operations are estimated to produce rates of
return on average net revalued fixed assets in excess of 8% per annum, as
required by the financial covenants of IDA Credit 564-SU until FY 1983.
Tariff increases would require to be implemented, however, at the rates of
4%, 16% and 19% in July 1983, 1984 and 1985 respectively, to achieve an 8%
rate of return. Water supply operations are expected to produce rates of
return in excess of the covenanted 4% per annum until FY 1984; tariff
increases would require to be implemented, however, at the rates of 5% and 8%
in July 1984 and 1985 respectively to achieve 4% rate of return. Assuming an
annual price escalation rate of 10%, the levels of electricity and water
supply tariffs in real terms would remain close to the mid-1979 levels.

3/   Including the amount expected to be disbursed in 1985, the total amount
of the proposed ODA grant is LSd 57 million (US$114 million).

6.13      The proposed IDA credit of US$65 million will provide 8% of the
financing required for PEWC's general construction program during FY1980 to
FY1984. The Government will relend the proposed IDA credit to PEWC at 12%
annual interest for a period of 20 years including a grace period of five
years. Interest during the grace period will be added to the principal
amount. The proposed rate is lower than the expected inflation rates in the
Sudan which are projected at 18%, 18% and 14% respectively for the years 1978,
1979 and 1980 and were 24%, 22% and 20% during the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.
The proposed interest rate of 12% is, however, in line with the interest the
Bank of Sudan charges on loans to public corporations but higher than the
interest rate of 8% the Government charges on the amounts of other foreign
credits or grants relent by it to PEWC. The disbursements from the proposed
credit will be converted into LSd at the Bank of Sudan's official exchange
rate on the date of each disbursement and the total amount of all disbursements
from the credit together with interest during the grace period will be con-
sidered the relent IDA loan to PEWC. The Government will assume the risk of
foreign currency rate fluctuations subsequent to each disbursement from the
proposed IDA credit. These relending terms were agreed with the Government
and PEWC during negotiations for the proposed credit, and execution of an
agreement between them will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit (para. 7.04a). A proposed grant of US$114 million equivalent from the
United Kingdom (ODA) will provide 16%, and a proposed grant of US$25 mil-
lion equivalent from the Federal Republic of Germany (BMZ) will provide 4%
of the financing required during FY 1980 to FY 1984 (paras 3.06 and 3.13).
6.14      Loans and credits which have been committed or are being negotiated
relate to a part of PEWC's other power development programs and will provide
(LSd 36 million) 10% of financing required during FY1980 to FY1984. Financing
for the foreign exchange expenditure which remains to be arranged totals LSd
43 million or 12% of the total financing required during FY1980 to FY1984,
and comprises: BNG Future Project LSd 22 million or 6%, portion of the power
development program outside BNG financing for which has not yet been arranged
LSd 5 million or 1%, and the water projects LSd 16 million or 5%. Completion
and commitment of the entire cofinancing required for the project should be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (para. 7.04b). The finan-
cing plan would take into account that the amount utilized by PEWC out of the
project preparation facility of US$1 million provided by the Association
would be reimbursed from the proposed credit.
6.15      The local currency funds needed during the period are estimated to
total LSd 95 million, representing 27% of total financing required during
the financial years 1980 to 1984. These are proposed to be provided out of
funds generated from operations (LSd 141 million) representing 41% of total
financing required. To ensure that the funds generated from electricity
operations will not be used on water supply projects, the covenant of IDA
Credit 564-SU for Power II Project, requiring that the Government would cover
any deficit arising between net internally generated funds from PEWC's water
operations and the cost of its water construction program, will be repeated
in the proposed credit (para. 7.02b). The Government has indicated that it
would exempt from payment of import duties and taxes, the generation, pro-
duction, transmission and distribution equipment to be imported by PEWC for



- 34 -
its electricity and water supply development programs and has exempted PEWC's
income from corporation tax for a period of five years.
6.16      The water supply projects and their estimated costs included in the
total PEWC construction program are tentative since consultants' feasibility
studies for the major water projects are not yet complete. The financing of
these projects has, therefore, been assumed in this report to be by outside
loans for the foreign currency component and the local costs to be financed
by internally generated funds from water supply operations.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations satisfactory agreements and assurances were
obtained from the Government with regard to the following:
(a) The procedures followed by the Bank of Sudan for opening of
letters of credit and those followed by the Central Purchase
Agency of the Ministry of Finance for review of tender
evaluations would be streamlined in accordance with changes
to be agreed with the Association (paras. 4.14 and 5.17).
(b) PEWC's external auditors would be appointed by the Government
no later than six months before the end of each financial
year (para. 5.21).
7.02      During negotiations satisfactory agreements or assurances were
obtained from the Government and PEWC with regard to the following:
(a) PEWC and the Government have established suitable procedures
for prompt payment of PEWC's electricity and water supply
dues by the government departments and agencies and to settle
past dues from them for electricity and water sales outstanding
on June 30, 1979 before June 30, 1980 (para. 5.19).
(b) Covenants of IDA Credit 564-SU dealing with rates of return,
debt service coverage, and provision of funds by the Govern-
ment to cover any deficits arising from PEWC's water operation
and water construction program would be repeated for the
proposed credit (paras. 6.01 and 6.15).
7.03      During negotiations satisfactory agreements or assurances were
obtained from PEWC with regard to the following:
(a) PEWC would continue to engage engineering consultants in
accordance with Bank guidelines for all phases of the project,
whose qualifications, experience and conditions of employment
are satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.14).



- 35 -
(b) PEWC'S board of directors had delegated adequate powers to
the General Manager, particularly in respect of staff
appointments, transfers and promotions, procurement, and
other powers necessary to enable him to manage PEWC's
activities effectively (para. 5.07).
(c) PEWC would employ at all times appropriately qualified and
experienced staff including management staff to fill the
positions of Directors of Electricity, Finance and Water
departments. Further, PEWC would not employ additional
unskilled staff until it had achieved a ratio of active
meters to employees of at least 40:1 (paras. 5.10 and 5.11).
(d) PEWC had initiated steps to appoint an expert for supervision
of the operation of Roseires hydroelectric station (para. 5.16).
(e) PEWC would prepare accounts statements and management reports
in respect of all of PEWC's regional offices and consolidated
with the head office accounts no less frequently than at
quarterly intervals starting from the accounts for periods
starting after July 1, 1980 (para. 5.20).
(f) PEWC had received some consultants' proposals (and would
receive others) for formulating training programs for its
technical and management staff and would submit the program
to the Association by July 1, 1980 (para. 5.24).
(g) PEWC had implemented cost reflecting tariffs with effect from
July 1, 1979 (para. 4.12).
7.04      The following events will be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed credit:
(a) Conclusions of the onlending agreement between the Government
and PEWC relating to the proposed credit (para. 6.13); and
(b) Completion of cofinancing arrangements for the proposed
project (para. 6.14).
7.05      With the above agreements, the project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$65 million equivalent for a term of fifty years including a
grace period of ten years to be relent to PEWC through a subsidiary loan
agreement acceptable to the Association.

POWER III PROJECT
Description of the Project
1.        The proposed Power III Project comprises the following major com-
ponents which are described below:
i)   Addition of the Fifth and Sixth Hydrogenerators and Embedded Parts
of Unit 7 at Roseires
When the Roseires dam was constructed, provision was made for the
installation of seven generating units. The proposed project includes the
engineering, supply, erection, commissioning and maintenance of units 5
and 6 comprising a vertical shaft Kaplan turbine similar to the four
existing turbines; a vertical shaft, salient pole synchronous generator rate
about 40 MW (43 MVA, 0.9 P.F.), with generation voltage of 11 kV, complete
with excitation equipment; gates and penstock to suit the existing structure,

management and all levels of technical staff (para. 5.24). The management
training program will include courses and seminars in Sudan and abroad for
PEWC's top and middle management positions as well as training for the senior
staff in the finance, administration and supplies departments. PEWC and its
consultants, the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB), have prepared a
technical training proposal which includes: (a) a comprehensive training
program covering the requirements of all technical staff (from engineer to
craftsman), and (b) extension of the existing training facilities (includes
addition of workshops, laboratory, lecture rooms and electrical and mechanical
training equipment). ESB's proposals on management training are presently
under review with PEWC and IDA.

NOTE: Comparing the two alternative programs, project components that are identical in both
programs   (40 Ml diesel units at Burri Station and reinforcement Burri-Khartoum North
transmission circuit) have been excluded when calculating the capital cost streams.
Furthermore, incremental fuel costs are shown in the cost streams (additional thermal
generation in the All Thermal Program).

POWER III PROJECT
Justification of installing Roseires Unit 6 hydro generator and embedded parts
of Unit 7 before raising the reservoir level at Roseires
Background
1.        The original conception of the Roseires development envisaged a
two-stage construction for the dam. Provision was therefore made for increas-
ing the dam height by 10 m and installing additional hydro generators at the
existing power plant. Only five hydro units could contribute with effective
power and energy capacity to the BNG before heightening of the dam, although
this contribution is substantially reduced during the period of low reservoir
levels (para. 4.01 and Annexes 4.2 and 4.3). The proposal to heighten the
Roseires dam would permit major irrigation projects to be developed and would
add significantly to hydroelectricity production (the first five units would
produce increased power and energy and all seven hydro units would contribute
with power and energy capacity during the entire year). The heightening of
Roseires dam is economically justified by its benefits in the irrigation
sector alone as well as by its power benefits alone. 1/
Installation of unit 6 at Roseires
2.        The installation of unit 6 in 1983 is justified in terms of fuel
cost savings during the rainy season when hydro availability is higher (it
displaces the corresponding thermal generation). No effective power and
energy contribution can be expected from this unit due to the limitation
of water when the reservoir level is lower (March through June). Therefore,
when comparing the two alternative programs of power plant additions (paras.
4.03, 4.04 and 4.05), unit 6 has been excluded from the basic "Hydro-Thermal
Program" and its costs and benefits were analyzed separately (with and without
heightening of the dam) based on the following assumptions:
1/   The justification and recommendations, which are included in the
Blue Nile Waters Study report prepared by the consultants of the
Ministry of Irrigation of Sudan, have already been accepted by
the Government of Sudan.

If the dam is heightened by 1988, unit 6 would contribute about
200 GWh/year during the period 1988-2019 on the basis of the system simulation
studies carried out by PEWC consultants.
b)   The cost of installing unit 6 and benefits (savings on fuel oil up
to year 2019), assuming the reservoir level at Roseires is not raised, are
shown in the following table:
1/   It is expected that the Eastern Grid would be interconnected to the BNG
during 1979/80. This proposal is included in the PEWC's 1978 Develop-
ment Plan and justified in terms of (a) savings in capital expenditures
(as additional 5-MW capacity would be required by 1983 in the Eastern
Grid); (b) savings in fuel costs by gaining access to cheap hydro power
at off-peak periods; and (c) greater security and continuity of supply.
2/   Energy contribution of Roseires unit 6 to the BNG and Eastern Grid is
based on results of simulation studies carried out by the consultants
(para. 4.06) and PEWC's 1978 Development Plan Assessment respectively.

Economic Analysis
3.        The total economic costs and benefits streams were discounted at
12%, Sudan's opportunity cost of capital in real terms, and the present
values are shown in the following table:
1!   Life hydro unit:  40 years
Fuel savings (benefits), were estimated based on operation of diesel
units with the following assumptions:
-    Effective economic cost of residual fuel 750 R viscocity:  105 LSd/ton
-    Specific fuel consumption:  0.26 kg/kWh
-    Specific cost of fuel:  0.0273 lSd/kWh
-    The energy produced by Roseires unit 6 and allocated to the Eastern
Grid would be absorbed by the BNG in the event that the Eastern
Grid's interconnection is not implemented.

With Dam Heightening            6,533          16,295            9,762
Without Dam Heightening         6,533          10,235            3,072
Further the equalizing discount rates (rate of return) of installing unit 6
with and without heightening the dam are 25.3% and 18.6% respectively.
4.        The installation of hydro unit 6 at Roseires is clearly justified
with heightening of the dam as the present value of its net benefits of
LSd 9,762,000 and the internal rate of return, 25.5% is substantially higher
than the opportunity cost of capital in Sudan. The investment is also justi-
fied, in case the height of the dam is not increased, as the present value of
its net benefits is estimated at LSd 3,702,000 and the internal rate of return
at 18.6% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital. The latter case is,
however, unlikely since the Government of Sudan has already accepted the
recommendations made by its consultants to heighten the dam.
Installation of Embedded Parts of Unit No. 7 at Roseires
5.        Because the working area becomes increasingly restricted as further
units are installed, the interrelated program for the remaining unit has been
carefully examined by the consultants of PEWC. They have concluded that the
embedded parts of unit 7 (mainly constuction of penstock and control gate)
should be built at the same time, thus enabling all concrete works to be
completed in one operation, leaving only the mechanical erection and cabling
of the unit to be carried out at a later date. Otherwise, (when units 5 and 6
are commissioned, among other restrictions, there would be no access from the
intake deck for erection of unit 7 penstock. Cost of the embedded parts of
unit 7 is a fraction of the project cost.

POWER III PROJECT
Comparison of Gas Turbines and Diesel Plant
1.        The types of generating plant that could be added to the BNG Grid
in time to meet the expected shortfall in capacity in FY 1981 are gas turbine
and diesel. The bulk of the additional plant must necessarily be diesel
plant as distillate fuel (gas oil) cost and its scarcity discourages the
use of gas turbines at present (see paras. 1.05 and 1.08) except at low plant
load factors, and diesel plant is the least cost alternative.
2.        The basic "Hydro-Thermal Program" (para. 4.05) was modified by
replacing either 20-MW or 30-MW capacity of diesel plant by an equivalent
capacity of gas turbine. Economic cost streams were developed for 15 years
for each alternative, considering only the cost streams of the modifications,
as other costs and benefits of the selected program are common for both
alternatives.
3.        Energy allocation simulation studies were carried out by PEWC
consultants for different types of existing and proposed power plant. It
was assumed that the gas turbines would be used to the minimum extent as gas
oil prices are markedly higher than the residual fuel used in the other
existing thermal plants (diesel and steam). Results show that the only
existing gas turbine at Kilo X would have first preference to operate as the
"'peak" unit. The proposed new gas turbines would receive second preference
but they would have to operate for more prolonged periods, working as "nearer
the base" (as they displace portion of the energy and power capacity of
equivalent diesel units which operate at a higher load factor). The energy
to be generated by the 20-MW or 30-MW gas turbines, which is equivalent to
the energy to be produced by the diesel units, is given in the following
table:

3.        The following table gives the total economic cost streams which
include capital, operation, maintenance and fuel costs, 2/ for the different
diesel plant capacity to be replaced (20-MW or 30-MW) as well as for the
different alternatives of gas turbine units (2x10-MW, 3x10-MW, 1x20-MW or
1x30-MW) which would replace the original diesel plant:

4.        The total economic cost streams were discounted at 12%, Sudan's
opportunity cost of capital in real terms, and the present value of each of
the alternatives were calculated. Furthermore, the equalizing discount rates
when comparing equivalent alternatives were obtained. The following table
illustrates the results of the economic comparison:

1/   The following assumptions were taken:
- Specific Fuel Price:  Diesel : 0.0193 LSd/kWh
Gas    : 0.0410 LSd/kWh
- Shadow exchange rate: LSd 1.0=US$1.75
- Expected life of equipment: 15 years
- Price levels of July 1979
- Operation and maintenance: Diesel : 2% of capital investment
Gas Turbine : 3% of capital investment

Difference in favor diesel units         538                15.55%
5.        The installation of 20-MW diesel generating units (present value =
LSD 11,592 million) in the early stages of the program is clearly more eco-
nomical than installing one 20-MW gas turbine unit (present value = LSd 11,795
million) or two 10-MW gas turbines (present value = LSd 12,192 million) as the
equalizing discount rates are 14.35% and 20.25% respectively. Diesel units
are economically preferable also for 30-MW capacity as the diesel units
(present value = LSd 16,986 million) are more economical than one 30-MW gas
turbine (present value = LSd 17,524 million) or three 10-MW gas turbines
(present value = LSd 19,648 million) at discount rates up to 15.55% and
27.65% respectively. The addition of gas turbines at present is not an
attractive alternative mainly due to:
(a) extremely high specific cost of distillate oil as compared
with residual oil (approximately 110% higher than residual
oil, 750 sec. viscosity, and 150% higher than residual oil,
3,500 sec. viscosity; and
(b) surplus in the Sudan of residual oil, which is being reexported
with a loss to the Sudanese economy (para. 1.05) and would be
used in considerable quantities when the steam turbine-driven
generators are installed in early 1983.

Local              18       14      11        9         8
Foreign             9       8        7        6         6
PEWC revalues its fixed assets annually to reflect the effects of currency
realignments as well as local and foreign price increases considering that 40%
of the value of its fixed assets represents local costs and 60% foreign costs.
Using these proportions and the above price escalation rates the fixed assets
values have been increased at the following rates:
13      10        9       7          7
2.   Accounts Receivable
After FY1978 PEWC is assumed to improve its billing and collections
with better management and with the help of a new computer. The percentage
of accounts receivable to sales revenue is, therefore, assumed to decline
gradually to 40%, 35%, 30%, 25% and 20% from FY1979 to FY1983 and then to 17%
in FY1984 and thereafter.
3.   Inventories
These are calculated at 4% of revalued fixed asset balances, in
accordance with past experience.
4.   Accounts Payable and Customers' Deposits
These are assumed to increase at 10% annually.

5.   Long-Term Debt
A statement showing the composition of projected foreign exchange
loans and credits and interest during construction assumed to S'e financed
in local currency appears on pages 3 to 7. The foreign exchange debt is
assumed to be provided through credits and grants to the Government, relent in
accordance with the Government's policy, to PEWC at an average of 8% annual
interest, repayable in 20 years including 5 years grace period, except for IDA
credit and ODA and BMZ grants which are assumed to be relent at 12% annual
interest. Interest during construction on relent amounts is assumed to be
financed by the Government in local currency.
II. INCOME STATEMENT
1.   Sales and Revenue
Energy sales projections for each customer category appear on
Annex 6.6. Water sales are assumed to increase 9% every year, which is
based on the growth rate between the period 1972 to 1977.
2.   Fuel Cost
This is based on estimated requirement of fuel for energy generation.
Unit cost of fuel is assumed to escalate at 10% annually after 1979 which may
be greater than the expected increase in international crude oil prices but is
realistic in view of the fact that with each increase in international oil
prices, the need for fuel conservation becomes greater and taxes on oil
products are progressively increased.
3.   Other Costs
These have been increased at various annual rates which provide for
increase in activity as well as price escalation of 10%. Maintenance require-
ments of electricity, for example, are estimated with reference to the plant
in operation each year and increased at different annual rates so calculated.
Other generation costs are assumed to increase 14% annually and energy distri-
bution and administration costs, 16%. Water supply production costs are
estimated to increase 16% annually and water distribution and administration
costs 14%.
4.   Taxes
PEWC's income has been exempted from corporation income tax (busi-
ness profits tax) for a period of five years FY 1980 - FY 1984. Income tax
for FY 1985 and FY 1986 has been provided for at 59% of net taxable income in
accordance with the current tax law.
5.   Depreciation
Depreciation is charged at 3% of the revalued fixed asset value at
the end of each year.
