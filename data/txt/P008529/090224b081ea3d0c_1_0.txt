Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower

SCHEDULE 8
Single Currency LIBOR Determination
1.    Single Currency LIBOR for any Single Currency for any Interest
Period shall be the offered rate for deposits in the Single Currency
for a period of six months which appears on the display designated
as page "3750" on the Telerate monitor (or such other page or
service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying London
interbank offered rates of major banks for Single Currency
deposits), as of 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the second day on which
banks and foreign exchange markets are open for business in London

Determination Date).
2.    If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on
such service as may replace it, the Bank shall request the London

which deposits in the Single Currency are offered by such banks on
the Interest Determination Date to leading banks in the London
interbank market for a period of six months ending on the last day
of such Interest Period. Single Currency LIBOR for such Interest
Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to
the fifth decimal place) of such offered quotations as determined by
the Bank.
3.    If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such
quotations under paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall be
arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth decimal
place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at least two
major banks in New York City for U.S. Dollars and Frankfurt for
Deutsche Marks, as the case may be selected by the Bank on the
Interest Determination Date for loans in the Single Currency to
leading European banks for a period of six months ending on the last
day of such Interest Period. If fewer than two of the banks so
selected are quoting such rates, Single Currency LIBOR shall be the
Single Currency LIBOR in effect for the last preceding Interest
Period.
