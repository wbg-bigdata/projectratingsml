MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR THE
PUMPING STATIONS REHABILITATION PROJECT II
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Arab Republic of Egypt for US$31.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including a grace period of five
years, and carry the Bank standard variable interest rate. The loan would
help finance a pumping station rehabilitation project covering 50 stations
throughout Egypt.
2.       Background:  Agriculture occupies a dominant position in the
Egyptian economy, accounting for 20% of GDP, 351 of the civilian employment
and 25% of merchandise export earnings. The land base for agricultural
production consists of 6.6 million Ieddan (fd) (2.7 million ha) of arable,
irrigated land. Irrigated farming in Egypt is supported by one of the
world's largest single river basin systems, extending 1,200 km from this
High Aswan Dam to the Mediterranean coast.
3.       Water for agricultural use accounts for about 90X of total demand
and pumping stations play a key part in delivering water to the field.
There are currently about 670 irrigation pumping stations of varying sizes.
The drainage system for removing excess water from the cultivated lands
consists of open drains and subsurface drains installed in an area of about
2.8 million fd, currently served by about 100 drainage pumping stations.
Given the flat topography of the country, an important feature of the
system is its critical dependencw or pumping stations, both tQ lift water
for irrigation and to pump out excess drainage flows.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement:  The current Bank strategy for
assistance to Egypt gives high priority, in a constrained budget situation,
to financing projects which improve the utilization of existing capacities,
particularly in commodity-producing sectors such as agriculture. With
demand growing rapidly, there is a pressing need to increase agricultural
production.  The pumping stations play a pivotal role in the operation of
the vast irrigation and drainage network in Egypt, which is crucial to
agricultural production. The rehabilitation of the aging pumping stations
was recommended as a priority operation in the Irrigation Subsector Review
carried out by the Bank in 1981. The first stage of the program is now
being successfully implemented, financed by a Bank loan of US$41.5 million.
Under that project, to be completed on December 31, 1990, 70 pumping
stations are being rehabilitated. The Bank's continued support will help
in maintaining the vital infrastructure in the irrigation and drainage
subsector. The facilities to be created under tne second project would be
complementary to those under the Upper Egypt Drainage II Project and Nile



- 2 -
Delta Drainage II Project. A list of ongoing projects is given in Schedule
D, page 1 of 2.
5.       Lessons Learned.  The Bank's long association with, and
substantial support to, GOE's program to improve the production efficiency
of the sector has provided certain guidelines for future agricultural
projects: (i) the most effective projects are simple and preferably involve
only one implementing ministry; (ii) the project implementation period
should take into account factors that usually cause delays, viz.,
procurement problems, staff shortages, and inadequate budgetary
allocations; (iii) the Government must be fully committed to the project;
and (iv) the strengthening of the management capability of agencies
responsible for project implementation must receive priority. These
lessons, and those learnt from completed drainage projects as well as the
experience gained from the first project, have been incorporated into the
design of the proposed project.
6.       Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are to
avoid future declines in yields and agricultural production, which would
occur if the proposed rehabilitation were not carried out. Other important
objectives are to reduce the operation and maintenance cost of the pumping
stations and to strengthen the institutional capability of the Mechanical
and Electrical Department (NED) of the Ministry of Public Works and Water
Resources (MPW).
7.       Project Description:  The proposed project would include:  (i) a
firm progrumn for the construction of six new pumping stations, the
extension of three stations for additional capacity, the replacement of
nine existing floating stations in Upper Egypt with land-based stations,
and the complete replacement of pumps and motors in eight stations; (ii) an
indicative program to replace electro-mechanical equipment and provide
spare parts for about 25 stations; (iii) the provision of 14 light mobile
workshops, equipment for central electrical laboratories, standard tools
and testing instruments for 200 stations and provision of vehicles and
miscellaneous equipment; (iv) provisions for electrification of cranes,new
electrical cranes, mechanized equipment for cleaning trash racks, power
capacitors and repair of the existing 80-ton floating dock; (v) civil works
for new and/or extensions to existing stations; new workshops, stores,
offices and staff housing, as well as the repair/rehabilitation of existing
facilities; (vi) institutional support through the provision additional
computer equipment for the Management Information System (MIS), including
microwave telecommunication equipment; (vii) technical assistance covering
specialized services for the MIS program; operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs/budgets; the privatization of workshop and repair facilities and the
strengthening of MED electrical laboratories; and the monitoring of
effluent quality and environmental studies at the two pumping stations near
Alexandria; and (viii) overseas and in-house training for key MED staff.
8.       The project would be implemented over a period of seven years by
MED. A Project Coordination Committee has been set up to expedite
implementation. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$49.1



- 3 -
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$32.4 million (66X). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement ari disbursement, and the disbursement schedule,
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank group operations in Egypt are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 8235-EGT dated
April 25, 1990 are also attached.
9.       Actions Agreed during Negotiations:  The following are key
assurances which were obtained from the Government of Arab Republic of
Egypt (GOE) during negotiations: (i) HED would submit for Bank review by
March 31 of each year an annual report giving details of the achievements
of the previous year and the budget provisions for subsequent year; Bank
comments, particularly on budgets for both O&M and local counterpart funds,
would be incorporated before final approval. The work programs would
specify, in detail, which stations are to be rehabilitated with estimated
cost, procurement and implementation schedules. Bank approval of the
program would be required before procurement could begin. (ii) For two
stations with environmental problems, the water quality would be monitored
over a period of at least one year and studies conducted to establish
methods of treatment to improve the quality to acceptable levels. (iii) The
Government would cause MPW to establish two Central Directorates, one for
Technical Inspection and another for Civil Works, and put in place an MIS
organization with appropriate staff by December 31, 1991. (iv) The
Government would cause MPW to prepare a study for O&M cost recovery by June
30, 1991 and a phased plan to implement the agreed recommendations of the
study by December 31, 1991. A phased plan for a continued transfer, to the
farmers and farmers groups, of booster pumps, wells and smaller capacity
lift stations would be prepared by December 31, 1991.
10.      The Government has taken the following actions to facilitate
project implementation: (i) MED assigned the technical inspection of the
pumping stations to its Technical Office and Secretariat pending the
establishment of the Central Directorate of Technical Inspection - a core
team of about ten professional engineers has been assigned to this task;
(ii) MED has appointed two senior civil engineers as acting Directors
General at the two Central Directorates for Upper and Lower Egypt with a
core staff to undertake civil works activities until a Central Directorate
for Civil Works can be established; (iii) MPW has established a Project
Coordination Committee; and (iv) MED has assigned six more experienced
engineers and appropriate support staff to the General Directorate for
Studies and Specifications.
11.      Benefits:  The benefits of the project would be obtained through
improvements in overall efficiency leading to lower operating costs,
reductions in maintenance costs and an increase in the reliability of pump
operations. These improvements would all help to ensure the primary
objective of the project -- safeguarding agricultural production and
preventing a decline in yields. The total area benefitting from the
project is estimated to be about 0.85 million fd; about 560,000
smallholders would benefit as they would be able to maintain their



- 4 -
production and, in most cases, diversify to increase their income. The
Economic Rate of Return for the pro3ect has been estimated to be 24X.
12.      Risks:  The main project risk is that the stations will not be
properly operated and maintained after rehabilitation and, therefore, will
quickly deteriorate. Progress has been made under the ongoing project (Ln.
2270-EGT) in implementing a computerized MIS to assist in O&M and stores
management. MED is taking steps to implement improved procedures and
systems in these areas. The establishment of an independent Central
Directorate for Technical Inspection and another Central Directorate for
Civil Works under the proposed project sh.)uld improve the situation and
reduce the risk of further deterioration. The proposed study on O&N costs
will help to estimate and provide an adequate level of funding for these
costs. Another possible risk is the lack of an adequate budget for both
operation and maintenance and counterpart funds for the execution of the
project. This risk would be reduced through an annual Bank review before
final government approval of the budget. There is a risk of delay in
project implementation. However, this is not considered lik3ly since MED
has gained considerable experience in procurement through the ongoing
project; it has the procurement processing of initial contracts already in
motion, which would zrllow for the award of initial procurement soon after
project effectiveness.
13.      Recommendarion:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
