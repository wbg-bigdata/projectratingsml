F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective was to improve child welfare and to protect children's
rights in Bulgaria through promoting community-based child welfare approaches such as



                                            ii

de-institutionalization, abandonment prevention and street children services, as cost-
effective alternatives to institutionalized child care.


  The key indicators and their targets as initially approved were:

  - the reduction of children in institutions, and
  - the provision of improved access and quality of services to economically and socially
disadvantaged children and their families.


  The specific original indicators and their targets were:

  - Number of institutionalized children be reduced by 20 percent;
  - Number of new entrants in the institutions from pilot municipalities be reduced by 20
percent;
  - Re-train 50 percent of the staff working in state residential care institutions in the pilot
municipalities, and re-deploy 20 percent of staff to provision of alternative care;
  - Provide social services and support to at least 30 percent of families at high risk in the
pilot municipalities;
  - Return 20 percent of the registered street children to their families, or place them in
alternative care; enroll 30 percent of them in alternative educational and vocational
programs; and provide health care services to 80 percent of those in the pilot
municipalities;
  - Average cost per child in community-based alternative care is maintained at no more
than 80 percent of the cost of care in traditional state owned institutions;
  - The following institutional structures responsible for the child protection become
operational by end of June, 2001 and be maintained thereafter. State Agency for Child
Protection (SACP), National Council for Child Protection (NCCP) and Child Protection
Departments (CPDs) at municipal level.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
There was no revision of the project development objectives.

  However, the key indicators were revised in line with the recommendations of the Mini
QER conducted during the MTR, in order to be more relevant to the children well-being
outcomes, to link them better to the different steps of the implementation of the CWR
strategy, and to make their targets more realistic. The revision of the key indicators was
requested by the Bulgarian's Government and approved by the Bank in a Letter dated
May 25, 2005.

  The revision consisted of the:

  - Introduction of three new key indicators: (i) overall reduction of child
institutionalization rates for the country, (ii) institutionalization rate in the pilot
municipalities is maintained below the country's average and (iii) permanency plans
provided for all the children in residential care in specialized institutions under the CPA,


                                               iii

and one intermediate indicator (percentage of staff working in the pre-school services in
the high-risk communities in            the pilot municipalities, belonging to the ethnic
communities);

  - Replacement of some of the initial ones less relevant to the development objectives
(juvenile delinquency rate) or unable to be adequately measured (average duration of
staying in child residential care).

  - Adjustment of the target values and deadlines for some of the initial ones.

  The revision improved the results framework without affecting the project expected
outcomes.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country context. Following the adoption of the Currency Board Arrangement in 1997,
Bulgaria undertook accelerated structural reforms accompanied by conservative fiscal
policies, that succeeded to restore growth, abate inflation and improve public and
investors' confidence. The GDP growth reached the level of 5.4 percent and the FDI
inflows got close to US$1 billion in 2000. The unemployment, however continued to
increase up to 18.1 percent in 2000, but noteworthy the poverty fell by nearly two-thirds,
from 36 percent in 1997, down to 13 percent in 2000.

CAS link. The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bulgaria, supported the
Government development agenda to advance substantial structural reforms, to rationalize
the role of the state and to enhance EU accession-related sector programs with
simultaneous provision of measures to protect people and vulnerable groups during the
transition and restructuring of Bulgaria's social protection system. One of the vulnerable
groups identified, inter-alia, by the CAS, where the children. It was estimated that in
1995, more that 40 percent of the children were living in poverty. The project, supported
the CAS objectives, by assisting the Government in developing and implementing a
comprehensive Child Welfare Reform strategy. It also contributed to the CAS goals by
promoting community based services and providing technical support and training for
capacity building at both local and central levels. The Government's efforts towards EU
accession were sustained by the CWR project, through the promotion and observance of
the concepts embodied in the UN and EU programmatic documents.

Sector background

Institutionalization.   Like in many other countries in Central and Eastern Europe,
institutionalization of children was a serious problem that needed urgent attention. A
number of 35,123 children (1.78 percent of the total number of children) were living in
public care institutions in September 2000. Most of these children were abandoned for
economic or social reasons. Many of them were physically or mentally disabled, but only
1 percent of the total institutionalized children, were orphans. The living conditions in
the institutions were poor and the quality of care provided was low, in the absence of
proper standards and regulations, as well as of adequately trained staff. The lack of
proper attention, care and programs to prepare them for independent living, made many
of them vulnerable to becoming unemployed and homeless, or led them towards violence,
crime, drugs, abuse or prostitution, when they had to leave the institutions at the age of
18.

Street Children. The emergence of the street children phenomenon was a common
feature in many ECA countries, including Bulgaria. Up to 5,000 children were estimated
to be living or working in the streets, this number fluctuating seasonally. Besides the
reasons related to transition hardships, homelessness, parental death/disability, or



                                             1

institutional drop-outs, some of the Government measures aimed at limiting the
admission in institutions, had adverse results in the absence of effective alternatives, and
contributed to the increase in the number of street children.

Limited Alternative Services. The very few alternative opportunities were available for
families in economic and social distress. The poorly designed cash or in-kind benefit
programs, and the few community-based services (either preventive or alternatives to
institutionalization) available at that time, were not able to improve the welfare of
children in need.

Diffusion of Responsibility. The responsibility for child welfare issues was divided
among five ministries and municipal authorities, making intervention and coordination
very difficult. Different institutional structures, each of them with its own bureaucracy,
induced confusion and made the people in need (families and children) running from an
institution to another, hampering the proper and timely resolution of their cases.

Rationale for Bank assistance. Deriving from its extensive international and regional
experience, the comparative advantage of the World Bank was linked to the ability to
design comprehensive reform programs, in consultation with other development partners,
covering the most critical reform areas and avoiding wasteful overlaps.           The well
recognized good results obtained in the implementation of similar programs designed by
the Bank, often attracted the interest of other donors and secured additional non-
reimbursable financing and technical expertise, which complemented thus the work of
the Government and the Bank in an integrative networking approach. The Bank had an
additional comparative advantage in that it created and enhanced circumstances for
ensuring successful intermediation between the Government's development policies and
the local community-based initiatives.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project development objective was to improve child welfare and to protect children's
rights in Bulgaria through promoting community-based child welfare approaches such as
de-institutionalization, abandonment prevention and street children services, as cost-
effective alternatives to institutionalized child care.

The key indicators and their targets as initially approved were:

     The reduction of children in institutions, and
     The provision of improved access and quality of services to economically and
        socially disadvantaged children and their families.

The specific original indicators and their targets were:

     Number of institutionalized children be reduced by 20 percent;
     Number of new entrants in the institutions from pilot municipalities be reduced by
        20 percent;



                                               2

     Re-train 50 percent of the staff working in state residential care institutions in the
       pilot municipalities, and re-deploy 20 percent of staff to provision of alternative
       care;
     Provide social services and support to at least 30 percent of families at high risk in
       the pilot municipalities;
     Return 20 percent of the registered street children to their families, or place them
       in alternative care; enroll 30 percent of them in alternative educational and
       vocational programs; and provide health care services to 80 percent of those in the
       pilot municipalities;
     Average cost per child in community-based alternative care is maintained at no
       more than 80 percent of the cost of care in traditional state owned institutions;
     The following institutional structures responsible for the child protection become
       operational by end of June, 2001 and be maintained thereafter: State Agency for
       Child Protection (SACP), National Council for Child Protection (NCCP) and
       Child Protection Departments (CPDs) at municipal level.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

There was no revision of the project development objectives.

However, the key indicators were revised in line with the recommendations of the Mini
QER conducted during the MTR, in order to be more relevant to the children well-being
outcomes, to link them better to the different steps of the implementation of the CWR
strategy, and to make their targets more realistic. The revision of the key indicators was
requested by the Bulgarian's Government and approved by the Bank in a Letter dated
May 25, 2005.

The revision consisted of the:

     Introduction of three new key indicators: (i) overall reduction of child
       institutionalization rates for the country, (ii) institutionalization rate in the pilot
       municipalities is maintained below the country's average and (iii) permanency
       plans provided for all the children in residential care in specialized institutions
       under the CPA, and one intermediate indicator (percentage of staff working in the
       pre-school services in the high-risk communities in the pilot municipalities,
       belonging to the ethnic communities);
     Replacement of some of the initial ones less relevant to the development
       objectives (juvenile delinquency rate) or unable to be adequately measured
       (average duration of staying in child residential care);
     Adjustment of the target values and deadlines for some of the initial ones.

The revision improved the results framework without affecting the project expected
outcomes. The Results Framework Analysis reflects the above mentioned revisions
accordingly.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

The allocation of project funds envisaged the provision of a wide range of services to the
local communities, especially to families at-risk (including young single mothers) and
their children, children already in institutions, as well as other children in difficulty such
as street children or children in temporary custody of the police.

Different levels of government, both central government and selected municipalities were
to benefit from capacity building, direct investments, and the support provided to them in
order to identify and test sustainable approaches that subsequently could be replicated at
a larger scale. NGOs and other private service providers were expected to be involved in
partnerships, developed with the central and local authorities for the implementation of
the sub-projects fostered under the project.

The project aimed at contributing also to the correct perception of the children rights and
issues by the population at large, as a result of the public awareness campaigns
implemented. Additional benefits envisaged the enhancement of coordination among a
wider network of development partners in support of child welfare reform, and the
provision of more cost-effective and socially-effective alternatives to large state
institutions.

1.5 Original Components

The project consisted of four components as follows:

Component 1. Capacity Building (US$8.27 million/EUR9.10 million total base cost).
This component envisaged the provision technical assistance (TA) and training for
capacity building, management and standard setting for the SACP and for the provision
of social services at the local CDP level. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for all the
project components, development and implementation of a Management Information
System (MIS) and public information campaigns, were activities included to support
effective and efficient reform implementation.

1.1. Policy Development Sub-Component (US$3.22 million/EUR3.54 million total base
cost). TA and training was to support the development and institutional building of the
SACP and the CPDs for the implementation of a coherent national policy for child
protection. Most of the financial support for this sub-component was pledged by other
donors: EU - Twinning Arrangement with Austria, and UK-DFID. The TA and training
earmarked for this component aimed at supporting the establishment of the SACP and its
capacity building, the establishment of the National Training for Social Work aligned to
EU standards, the development of the national minimum standards for child welfare
services, the strengthening of the implementation capacity in the pilot municipal CPDs,
as well as the specialized training for judges dealing with children.




                                              4

1.2. Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.66 million/EUR4.03 million total base cost). The
M&E of all project activities was consolidated under this sub-component. Three inter-
related Management Information Systems were to be developed for: (i) the Municipal
Social Assistance Services - Sofia headquarters and local branches; (ii) the CPDs in order
to implement a child monitoring and tracking system at national, regional and municipal
levels able to monitor the in- and out-flow of institutionalized children; and (iii) the
overall project related MIS for monitoring impact and performance. Support for carrying
out impact surveys as well as several beneficiary assessments in the selected pilot
municipalities were also included.


1.3. Public Awareness and Training (US$0.78 million/EUR0.86 million total base cost).
This sub-component envisaged support for the design and implementation of public
awareness campaigns that made families aware of the existence of alternative services to
institutionalization, changed the public attitudes regarding the institutionalized children
and the acceptance re-integration of institutionalized children into society and also helped
changing the attitudes of the professionals working in the child welfare/protection system.
The delivery of specialized training for social work and management of social services
targeted to the CPDs staff in the selected pilot municipalities was also intended.

1.4. Project Management (US$ 0.61 million/EUR 0.67 million total base cost). This sub-
component aimed to support the functioning of the Project Management Unit (located in
the MOLSP), which was responsible for the implementation and management of project
activities in the areas of: procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation,
communications and public awareness, donor coordination and management training.
Provision of furniture and limited office equipment (software, computers, printers,
copiers and fax machines), financing of the PMU operational costs (including staff
remuneration and training) as well as the consultants' fees were included in the project
design.

Component 2. De-Institutionalization (US$ 7.01 million/EUR 7.71 million total base
cost). This component aimed to support the improvement of child welfare in the selected
pilot municipalities, by identifying, financing, monitoring and evaluating social services
targeted at the: (i) prevention of child abandonment and institutionalization; (ii) de-
institutionalization of children living in the old type residential institutions; (iii) fostering
and adoption; (iv) prevention of deviant behavior and school drop-out; and (v)
restructuring and rehabilitation of the viable existing institutions.

Initially, seven municipalities were pre-selected to become pilot areas for the
implementation of project activities, using a clearly defined set of evaluation criteria:
Plovdiv, Varna, Shumen, Russe, Stara-Zagora, Sliven and Sofia, with the possibility of
adding another three municipalities later on during the project implementation.

The alternative community-based services to be financed as sub-projects, were based on
the models of Mother and Baby Units and Community Support Centers developed
previously with the NGO support, under a wide participatory approach that involved



                                               5

large consultations with both professionals and potential beneficiaries. These services
were to be developed in partnership with the municipalities, which committed the
provision of buildings and/or land for the construction of new small facilities, while the
loan was to support the financing of feasibility studies, designs, civil works for the
rehabilitation/construction of building infrastructure, furniture, equipment and supplies.

Component 3. Abandonment Prevention & Protection of Children's Rights
(US$ 3.39 million/EUR 3.73 million total base cost). This component was to support the
implementation of community based services aimed at the prevention of child
abandonment amongst high-risk and disadvantaged communities with a particular
emphasis on Roma communities. The project funding planned to cover two specific
areas of intervention: (i) early child development and pre-school education, and (ii)
police interaction with children in general and high-risk communities in particular, in
supporting the prevention of abandonment and institutionalization, as well as the
appropriate resolution of social problems involving children.

3.1. Child Development in Disadvantaged Communities (US$1.06 million/EUR1.17
million total base cost). A competitive grant scheme of EUR1 million was planned to be
established with financial support form the JSDF, in order to finance small sub-projects
for the establishment/expansion of pre-school and kindergarten programs for children in
the poorest communities (mainly Roma), and prepare them for school attendance,
enhance the Bulgarian language skills, provide basic health care and nutritional aid.

3.2. Child Protection (US$ 1.41 million/EUR 1.28 million total base cost). Drawing upon
the positive results obtained under programs previously financed by the UK DFID, this
sub-component included support for the delivery of specialized training to the police
officers working with children, the minor refurbishment and training equipment for the
National Training Center in Sofia, as well as the development of training materials. The
Bank loan also earmarked support for the extension of community police program
successfully piloted in Plovdiv, focused on schools outreach to prevent crime, enhance
life skills and promote the correct understanding of the police and its role.

In addition, the project envisaged support for the refurbishment of Child Pedagogic Units,
Juvenile Temporary Placement Homes, and 24-hour detention rooms, in order to properly
accommodate children in distress (e.g. juvenile offenders, lost children, victims of
violence, abuse and/or crime), and to comply with EU norms for child safety, comfort
and security, ensuring thus the protection children's rights.

3.3. Reduction of Social Exclusion (US$1.05 million/EUR1.15 million total base cost).
This sub-component, entirely financed by UK DFID, envisaged mainly the provision of
technical assistance and advisory services for the development of Roma social exclusion
local plans and sub-projects, and of training for Roma community facilitators in social
work, children's issues and economic development and employment. These activities
were envisaged to be implemented in selected areas in Sliven, Nova Zagora and Yambol,
in strong partnership with the MSAS, CPDs and the selected municipalities.




                                             6

Component 4. Street Children Services (US$0.86 million/EUR0.95 million total base
cost). In order to decrease the magnitude of the street children phenomenon, common to
many countries in transition, the project planned to support the selected municipalities,
working in partnership with local organizations and NGOs, to identify, finance,
implement and monitor social services, aimed at promoting family and social
reintegration, securing shelter and basic services (health, education), providing legal and
vocational advice as well as psychological support and family counseling.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were never revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

The project closing date was extended twice by an aggregate number of 24 months.

The first extension of 12 months (until June 30, 2005) was granted in March 2004. The
extension requested by the Bulgarian Government was discussed during the MTR
mission (Dec. 2003) and agreement was reached on the next steps to be undertaken as
prerequisites for the approval of the extension. The main reason of the first extension
was the recognition that the project design was too ambitious to be implemented during
the original period of three years.

The second extension of 12 months (until June 30, 2006) was granted in February 2005,
and it was accompanied by a re-allocation of Loan proceeds among the expenditure
categories, in order to allow the proper funding of the operational costs for the first year
of functioning of the community based services, established under the project. The
extension was granted following the achievement of the agreed pre-conditions.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

In-depth assessments of the overall situation of child protection and of the various
particular sector issues in Bulgaria were carried over during the early stages of project
preparation.   Institutional and social assessments, beneficiary surveys, and well as
stakeholder consultations were conducted. Of a particular importance for the correct
identification of the problems that the child protection system faced at that time, was the
"Social Assessment of the Bulgaria Childcare System of Bulgaria", jointly conducted by
UNDP, UNDESA and the World Bank (July 2000).

During the preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from the
previous experience gained both globally and locally, identified critical risks and their
mitigation measures. The project preparation was conducted in a participatory approach
involving the relevant stakeholders at both national and local levels, professionals, NGOs
and beneficiaries.



                                             7

The following lessons were taken into account during project preparation, and measures
were envisaged to address them during the project implementation.

    Project Complexity. The complexity of the Bulgarian child welfare system was
       known at the time of the project preparation, with a division of responsibilities
       among five line Ministries, municipalities and with many inter-related dimensions.
       The need to adequately respond to the challenge of a complex coordination of
       project activities and institutions involved was identified. To address this issue,
       the simplification of implementation arrangements was considered, through the
       establishment of a single PMU in the MOLSP with an operational linkage to the
       CPDs at the municipal level, and with a special emphasis on the development of a
       national MIS and a solid M&E.           A Project Steering Committee was also
       established to ensure a coherent multi-sectoral approach to the overall Project.

    Integrated approach. Many inter-related aspects have to be tackled in the attempt
       to improve the child welfare such as: living condition, nutrition, health education
       and training. Therefore, in order to achieve a real impact the interventions have
       to be done on multiple fronts simultaneously. Therefore, the project design
       envisaged the promotion of integrated activities, targeting a relatively small
       number of locations to achieve the critical mass of tangible results and
       demonstrating       the    positive     effects   of     such     an     approach.

    Sustainability. The absence of a coherent approach to child welfare issues may
       lead to scattered interventions supported by the government and other various
       development partners. Although positive results were observed in some cases, the
       sustainability issue remained an important one, since often the good practice and
       human capital acquired was lost after the project completion. The adoption of the
       Child Protection Act and of the first National Strategy and Action Plan for Child
       Protection, during the project preparation phase, provided solid ground for
       sustainable reforms. The project design paid significant attention to the need of
       securing adequate financial support for all the activities envisaged for both the
       implementation            and            Post         completion            phases.

    Project Readiness.        Often, the project implementation is delayed and the
       achievement of development objective is hampered in the absence of the
       readiness for implementation when the projects become effective. To prevent this
       problem, intensive efforts were made so that sub-projects were prepared up-front
       (in terms of selection and design), effective procurement and disbursement
       arrangements were in place, as well as clear flow of funds and implementation
       procedures (PIM, MIS, M&E and FMS), before the project effectiveness.

Adequacy of participatory processes.

All the project preparation stage was marked by a continuous consultation with a wide
range of stakeholders such as: (i) central Government agencies represented by all the line
Ministries involved in the child protection issues; (ii) municipalities, local level



                                             8

administration and the decentralized units of the central Government agencies; (iii)
various international and bilateral development partners: UNICEF, UNDP, EU PHARE,
UK DFID, Austrian Government and Swiss Development Cooperation; (iv) key NGOs
active in the child welfare system in Bulgaria; and (v) individual and community
beneficiaries whose opinions were collected through social assessments and beneficiary
surveys. This participatory approach was reflected in the financing of the project and
continued throughout the entire project implementation.

Risks and their mitigation:

The enhanced consultations with the various stakeholders involved in the child protection,
allowed the identification of the following potential risks that could have adversely
impacted the project performance, and of the appropriate measures to address them:

     Scarce allocation of budgetary resources to the project activities due to
       constrained fiscal space. Mitigation measures.       The PMU and the selected
       municipalities had to ensure rigorous and timely planning of the budget
       allocations needed to cover all the project activities. The Bank, NGOs and the
       development partners had to thoroughly monitor the budgeting process.

     Lack     of adequacy and unclear regulations developed for the reform
       implementation. Mitigation measures: All the development partners involved in
       the project implementation were to provide specific support for SACP's capacity
       building.

     Negative public attitude and non-supportive environment. Mitigation measures:
       The project design included the development and implementation of public
       awareness campaigns to enable the correct understanding of the rationale for the
       activities agreed to be implemented in the communities. Also, the involvement of
       the local communities in the preparation of the sub-projects, contributed to the
       prevention                   of                negative                 reactions.

     Adversity of the ethnic minority groups. Often the minority ethnic groups (Roma)
       become suspicious when "outsiders" interfere in their community life, questioning
       the need of the intervention and become reluctant to accept them. Mitigation
       measures: The community members (beneficiaries) and especially the traditional
       community leaders were involved both in the preparation and implementation
       phase     activities.       The    PMU      hired    an    Ethnicity   Specialist.

     Street children do not respond to services offered. Mitigation measures: Specially
       trained teams of social workers outreached the street children and provided
       adequate counseling support. The project supported also, the development of
       specific and attractive educational and vocational training programs for the street
       children.

2.2 Implementation

The project was never at risk, although the implementation was slower that expected,
sometimes being hampered by the scarce availability of counterpart funds or by political
changes. Several key factors contributed to the successful implementation performance,
and the achievement of the development objectives, despite the difficulties faced at
various moments during the implementation period:

    Solid reform background. The reform legal framework initiated by the Child
       Protection Act (aligned to the best international standards), and backed up by the
       subsequent relevant secondary legislation, promoted principles and actions to be
       implemented, difficult to be ignored or rejected by any governing entity. This
       allowed the project to continue its implementation as initially designed, in spite of
       the   frequent    changes    in  the   Government,        over   the   project    life;

    Strong capacity building support. The success of the reforms implementation
       depends to a large extent, on the appropriate understanding of these reforms and
       on the capacity of the implementing partners. The training and the technical
       assistance provided to the main agencies responsible for the child
       protection/welfare both at central level (MOLSP, SACP, Social Assistance
       Agency) and regional and local levels (Regional Social Assistance Directorates,
       CPDs, Municipalities and even NGOs), made them valid partners in the process ,
       equally motivated to implement the child protection reform programs. Notably
       the Municipalities' willingness to effectively collaborate has increased
       significantly during the project implementation (as acknowledged also by the
       representatives of the NGO sector), which made possible the completion of the
       integrated community support centers in the selected areas, and the first year of
       functioning;

    Implementation arrangements. In the context of multiple players involved in
       the child protection system, the single PMU solution, and its placement in the
       premises of the MOLSP, close to the major policy decision maker in the social
       protection area, ensured continuity in the project implementation, overcoming
       most of the hardships caused by the changes in the country's political
       environment.

There were no major changes of the project design, its content and components. The
only changes were the two extensions of the closing date and one reallocation of funds
mentioned earlier, that actually allowed the full utilization of the project potential and its
proper completion.

The Project greatly benefited from the conclusions and recommendations of the Mid-
Term Review (MTR), which took place in December 2003, which assessed the progress
on all project components, using the outcome, progress and financial indicators
developed at the design stage. As part of the MTR exercise, a Mini Quality Enhancement
Review (QER) was conducted, further contributing to the identification of the current



                                            10

issues and of the actions to be taken to ensure the proper completion of the project. The
main conclusions are summarized below:

     Development Objectives. The Mini QER confirmed that PDOs were still valid
       and relevant, and that the Project obviously contributed to the modernization of
       the Bulgarian child welfare policies, and indicated that special efforts were
       needed to ensure the achievement of the DOs. At the same time it recommended
       to establish more clear links between policies and program intervention on one
       hand, and the outcomes for children on the other, and hence to seek for more
       relevant measurable intermediate indicators.
     Institutional arrangements.      The Project complexity, with linkages to many
       ministries and agencies, often resulted in a lack of consensus amongst the
       involved    institutions,  which    slowed    down    the    implementation.   MTR
       recommended that more attention be paid to inter-agency/cross-ministerial
       mechanisms, to the definition of clearer roles for all relevant players, and to the
       strengthening of cross-sectoral approach at both central and municipal levels.

     Pilot provision of community-based child care services.           The feasibility and
       realism of the effective implementation of these services in the remaining project
       timeframe and budget was analyzed, recommending further in-depth assessment
       of the demand-side factors that led to the institutionalization, and the development
       of clearly articulated strategies for institutional restructuring and prevention of
       institutionalization, before going to the investment phase.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E was based on the management information system (MIS) developed within the
PMU. Information on project progress was collected through regular reports, supervision
missions, and routine visits to the sites where the sub-projects for social services were
implemented. The physical inspections on the project sites revealed proper utilization of
project funds and of the goods, works and services financed.

Also, external evaluations were sequentially conducted within the framework of the
Component 1 of the Project, where five assessments were periodically carried out,
including one baseline beneficiary survey.        The PMU employed a Monitoring and
Evaluation specialist that collected the relevant information and kept updated progress
against PDO indicators and intermediate outcome indicators as they are presented in the
Data Sheet F (Results Framework Analysis) of this ICR.

The relevance of the PDO indicators and intermediate outcome indicators was constantly
assessed, and as a result of the MTR exercise they were revised to better link them to the
PDOs, both country-wide and in the project targeted areas (Municipalities). The revision
consisted in both structural changes and minor adjustments of the target values for some
of them, as presented in Section 6.3, in order to be more realistic. Data Sheet F (Results
Framework Analysis) reflects this revision accordingly.




                                             11

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no major environmental issues during project implementation, given the
relatively small size civil works for the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, or the
construction of new small building infrastructure for the sub-projects under components
II, III and IV. Although Bulgaria's environmental laws and regulations were compatible
with the Bank and EU policies, at the time of the project approval, the Project
Implementation Manual indicated that enhanced precautions be taken in order to avoid
any negative impact. Thus: (i) only licensed constructors were eligible to undertake
construction works; (ii) information regarding the sub-projects was widely disseminated
in the beneficiary communities, local stakeholder consultations were held and they
feedback was seek; and (iii) the PMUs inspection visits to the sub-project sites focused
on environmental issues as well, ensuring that the sub-projects with likely negative
environmental impact were not financed, and the implementation of the approved sub-
projects was done in full compliance with the national environment legislation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The CWR Project is considered by the Bulgarian Government a successful intervention,
which supported the design of the child protection/welfare reforms and their
implementation. The development of standards for social services for children, the
introduction of licensing regime for the social service providers, the approval of the
procedures for outsourcing the provision of social services for children, the introduction
of the case management mechanism in the activity of the CPDs, and the approval of the
unified financial standards for the funding of the social services are key achievements of
the project that secured a solid legal framework to enable both the adequate maintenance
of the current investments and the expansion of investments through future programs.

Of particular importance for the future enhancement of public-private partnerships in the
area of child protection in Bulgaria is the approval of new unified client based standards
for the financing of Community Support Centers, Mother and Baby Units and Day Care
Centers for Street Children, beginning with July 2006.

The institutional capacity built both at the central and municipal levels as well as the
capacity building provided by the Project to the NGOs involved in the design and
implementation of the sub-projects, contributed to the better understanding (at all levels)
of the child welfare system needs and further necessary actions to be taken. The project
also paved the way for a smoother collaboration among all the key system stakeholders
for the further promotion of reforms.

The CWR Project also paved the way for subsequent, more systematic, efforts by
Government to promote intergenerational social inclusion. The Bank is supporting these
efforts through the planned FY'07 Social Inclusion Project (SIP) which will promote
social inclusion through increasing the school readiness of children below the age of 7,
targeting low-income and marginalized families (including children with a disability and
other special needs). The SIP will also contribute to the sustainability of the school



                                             12

readiness program by supporting the absorption of European Social Fund financing for
this purpose.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objective was clear and valid for the entire project life, and
continues to be relevant to the country's social and economic development, today. This
is reflected in the recent Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria (May 2006)
which indicates four key challenges that remain for Bulgaria's successful integration with
EU: (i) further enhancement of reforms to promote productivity and employment for
sustained high private sector led growth; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity and
public finance management for improved service delivery and effective absorption of the
EU grant funds; (iii) addressing the poverty and social exclusion issues aimed at a wider
participation in growth; and (iv) maintenance of macroeconomic stability as the
foundation for sustained economic growth.

The objective of the project remains relevant for the third CPS challenge, as the social
inclusion can be promoted also through an aggressive de-institutionalization process
backed up by the strong development of alternative community based services. It is also
relevant for the second challenge since the institutional capacity building supported by
the CWR project is a prerequisite for the proper absorption of the EU grant funds for this
area. At the same time, the positive experience gained in the de-institutionalization pilots,
can be easily replicated country wide with financial support of the EU structural funds.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall rating for outcome: Satisfactory

Policy development and capacity building.             The legislation regarding the child
protection that was adopted prior to project effectiveness, and the primary and secondary
legislation passed during the project implementation, consolidated the legislative
framework needed for the reforms implementation. The newly established institutions:
SACP and CPDs were supported by the Project with staff training, technical assistance
and office equipment, so that in relatively short period of time they became key players in
the child protection system administration and reforms implementation. Some 337 staff
(social workers) activating at all levels child protection system administration, were
trained during the project implementation in various topics of the social work.
Interestingly, the Government agreed to also support specific training for the NGOs staff
in the areas where the NGOs were less developed.

The SACP was initially created as an autonomous public body to protect children's rights
by developing and enforcing child welfare standards and monitoring compliance with
them. However, the role and the future of the SACP remains unclear in the perspective



                                             13

of the EU integration, when it may lose some of its prerogatives related to service
standards' setting and supervision and thus its operational autonomy may be diminished.
The CPDs were initially established as part of the Municipal Social Assistance Services
(structures at the local level at double financing and administration of the National Social
Assistance Agency, and the municipal authorities) and later they were incorporated in the
frame of municipal offices of the executive Agency for Social Assistance.

The development and approval of new and tightened criteria for admission in child care
institutions, corroborated with the prevention activities implemented under the Project,
contributed to the decrease in the number of new entries in the residential institutions in
pilot municipalities by 27% (well beyond the initial target of 20%). The minimum
quality standards for social services (for Residential Care, Foster Care and Community
based Services) and the unified per capita financing standards for childcare services
(Community Support Centers, Mother and Baby Units and Street Children Centers)
developed under the Project are valid for both public and private service providers. Their
proper enforcement will be conducive to the provision of high quality child care services
across the entire Bulgarian child welfare system.

At the same time, the regulations regarding the contracting/outsourcing the provision of
services for children and families, approved in 2003, enabled the development of public
private partnerships for the provision of such services as community based alternatives to
the institutionalized care.

Significant importance was attached to the developments in the Monitoring and
Evaluation areas. A three pillar inter-related MIS (software and hardware) was developed
to cover the IT needs for (a) Monitoring and Evaluation in the Municipal Social
Assistance Services; (b) CPDs for monitoring the flow of children in and out institutions,
and (c) PMU for CWR project reporting purposes. All the elements of the MIS were
functional at the project closing date, except for the child tracking system which became
functional before the end of 2006. The richness of information provided by the MIS
allowed the accurate evaluation of the achievement of PDO in great details as presented
in the Results Framework Analysis.

The Public Awareness Campaigns, conducted during the period 2003-2006, successfully
contributed to the correct understanding and wide acceptance of the reforms, to the
outreach of targeted beneficiaries, and gave a good exposure to the Government efforts of
improving the overall situation of children in Bulgaria.

De-Institutionalization and Street Children.

Besides enabling the legislative framework, real de-institutionalization is possible when
alternative and sustainable solutions are available. Hence, the Project supported the
establishment of 10 Community Support Centers that are hosting a variety of social
services for children and their families (more types that initially envisaged), such as: day
care for disabled children, family counseling and support, prenatal and postnatal care,
family planning, child abuse prevention and support for children victims of domestic



                                              14

violence, emergency reception, life skills training, prevention of deviant behavior and
support to young offenders, school drop-outs prevention, foster care, community
development, mother and baby units, adoption services, and shelters for street children.
Nine of these centers were fully functional at the project closing date, and the last one
became functional before the end of 2006. The Project supported also the establishment
of 9 Mother and Baby Units and 6 Day Care Service Units for Street Children in the
selected municipalities, which were all fully functional the project closing date, except
for one MBU that became functional few months later.

The development and provision of social services supported by the project led to the
improvement of the children's welfare in the selected pilot municipalities. The good
results obtained in the assistance of the 3,721 clients (children and families) in the
relatively short period of time that they effectively functioned before the Project closing
date, together with the certainty of future adequate financing secured by the approved
transfers for the state budget to municipalities, gives confidence that they will be
enhanced on the long run, in a sustainable manner.

The availability of a wide range of community based services as viable alternatives to the
institutionalized care, contributed to the decrease of the number of children in public
child care institutions in pilot municipalities, by 18.2%, exceeding the revised target
value. Also the overall country wide institutionalization rate decreased from 1.91% to
1.53% at the end of the Project implementation. The participatory approach in which
these services were designed and developed, ensured ownership, contributed to the
increase of the human capital and to the wide acceptance of the new approach, while the
competitive process used for the selection of the service providers led to good proposals,
reflected later in the high quality of services provided.

The positive impact of the de-institutionalization activities was also confirmed by the
comprehensive independent assessment of the Complexes for Social Services, conducted
in May 2006, that revealed significant changes of attitude to children's problems, both on
the responsible stakeholders and beneficiaries after only 6 months of effective
functioning, in 7 out of the 10 pilot municipalities.

Also, the perspective of the still institutionalized children has been influenced by the
Project, as a result of the enforcement of permanency plans provision for each
institutionalized child. Thus, more than 60% of all institutionalized children in pilot
municipalities had such plans developed before the project closure. [ PDO. 6 ]

The street children interventions had positive results.      As a result of the programs
implemented under the Project in the pilot municipalities, 107 children (25% of the
registered number) were returned to their natural families or were placed in alternative
services, and 160 children (37.8% of the registered number) were enrolled in alternative
education or vocational training programs. [IO. 18 ]

The dissemination of the good results obtained increased the interest for a wider
replication of such services outside the pilot municipalities. Thus, many similar sub-



                                              15

project proposals are currently in the pipeline, waiting to be financed under the
forthcoming EU PHARE 2004 program or post-accession funds.

Abandonment Prevention & Protection of Children's Rights.

Through a participatory approach that targeted the youngest children in the disadvantaged
communities (mainly Roma and Turkish), and their families, the Project (with JSDF
Grant support) enabled the establishment and expansion of pre-school and kindergarten
programs, allowing these children to prepare for school, enhance their Bulgarian
language skills. Also basic health care services, nutritional support and school supplies
were provided to the poorest families. Kindergarten infrastructure and classrooms was
rehabilitated with joint support from the Grant and parents, and staff adequately trained.
The Project was instrumental for the formalization of the profession of "Ethnic Minority
Teaching Assistant", and for the increased formal involvement of the people from the
ethnic communities in the provision of pre-school services.

During the implementation period of June 2002  October 2003, 87 NGOs from the 10
pilot municipalities implemented 55 sub-projects with 4,102 children as direct
beneficiaries, supporting the social integration and early childhood development
initiatives (equal start at school for children from disadvantaged communities). The
Implementation Completion Report (May 2004) of the JSDF Grant (TF024743),
confirmed the positive results obtained under this program.

Recognizing child delinquency as a visible phenomena, the Project also supported
specialized training for police staff working with delinquent children or with deviant
behavior, as well as the refurbishment of the child pedagogic units (almost 200 units)
from the Police Departments in the pilot municipalities, in order to enforce the
observance of the children rights even when these children are in barely legal situation.
The training program developed with the technical support financed by DFID, was well
perceived by the Ministry of Interior that decided to include it in the regular curriculum
of the police training.

The outreach activities implemented by the police departments in partnership with
schools and communities (parents included) in areas with high delinquency rates,
contributed to attitude chance regarding the role of the police, as well as to the prevention
of delinquency among the children. A number of 944 schools were included in the
community police program exceeding by far the initially envisaged targets.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

As documented above, the CWR project has achieved its objectives and is rated as
satisfactory.    The Project successfully supported the Bulgarian Government in its



                                            16

attempt to improve the child welfare in line with the EU requirements and best practices,
and to fulfill its commitment to the observance/compliance of the United Nations
Convention on Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The positive policy developments, the
commitment of the Bulgarian Government to implement these reforms as well as the first
tangible results in the improvement of child welfare, contributed significantly to the EU
appreciation of overall situation of children's protection, and hence to the removal of the
warning flags that Bulgaria had in the EU accession reports.

The satisfactory rating is based on the evaluation of all Bank reports, documents prepared
by the Government of Bulgaria, beneficiary surveys and stakeholder analysis workshops
conducted by independent consultants, and on direct discussions with relevant
development partners, Government officials and representatives of the NGO sector, as
well. At one stage in 2004, the likelihood of meeting the PDO was endangered by the
lack of adequate counterpart funds but this problem was addressed in due time.

This rating is also supported by the Government of Bulgaria in its assessment of the
project implementation. The Government ICR highlights that the Project acted as a
"driving engine" that significantly contributed to the launch of reforms in the child
protection area and to the successful implementation of its early steps. Having in mind
that the implementation these reforms still has to be expanded country wide in order to
build-up a sound child welfare system in Bulgaria, the Project can be considered as an
"ice breaker", enabling the fast consolidation of the child welfare reforms.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Social development. The Project had an important impact in terms of the Government
support for the development of alternative community based social services for a wider
rage of beneficiaries, country wide. Once the outsourcing of child welfare activities to
other social service providers outside the public sector providers was agreed, and the first
good results were obtained under the Project, the Government had good incentives for the
approval of the unified financing standards for the funding of social services for children
and their families.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact at both central
level and local level agencies as recognized also by the Borrower's ICR (Annex 7) and
demonstrated by the following:

Central Government Capacity.         The State Agency for Child Protection (SACP),
established as a new autonomous body in the landscape of the central Government
institutions, during the Project implementation, became in a relatively short period fully
functional, exercising its the prerogatives with great commitment.           The technical



                                            17

expertise acquired by the SACP staff, allowed the Agency to significantly contribute to
the development of standards for child social services, procedures for licensing the
service providers, and of the case management mechanism in the CPDs. The SACP
became the key player in the coordination and harmonization of the interventions in the
Bulgarian child protection system.

Local Government Capacity. The Project was instrumental for building the capacity in
the newly established CPDs, as local structures of the Agency for Social Assistance.
Initially the CPDs were established only in some of the larger municipalities, but later on
they became present in all the municipalities. The training provided to the CPDs staff as
well as to the managers of Social Assistance Directorates (SAD) and Regional Social
Assistance Directorates (RSAD) from the ten project pilot municipalities, allowed them
have a good common understanding of the child protection issues and of the measures
needed to properly address them. Thus, the collaboration among the various players at
the local level has been improved significantly at the completion of CWR project,
compare with the time the project was prepared.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Project implementation revealed an unexpected issue that could have endangered the
achievement of the development objectives, namely the limited capacity of the NGO
sector in the country that was meant to provide the new services developed under the
Project. Though many of the services supported under the CWR project were themselves
based upon the previous NGO initiatives, in many parts of the country there were few
effective NGOs capable to provide adequately the needed services. It was a novel
experience in Bulgaria for the Government to agree to use public resources to increase
the capacity of the NGO sector through the provision of TA and training, thus to helping
them to become reliable partners in the project implementation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

An independent assessment of the Complexes for Social Services, conducted in May
2006, revealed the gains observed after only 6 months of their effective functioning, in 6
pilot municipalities: Plovdiv, Stara Zagora, Varna, Shumen, Turgovishte and Rousse.
The assessment used both quantitative (polls) and qualitative (in-depth interviews and
focus groups) methods gathering information from beneficiaries and stakeholders. For
details, see Annex 5. The main achievements are summarized below:

     Positive change in the communities attitude to children's problems such as: (i)
        emphasis has shifted from the family to the child itself; (ii) positive attitude of the
        beneficiaries of social services, in the sense that the professional interventions are
        no longer perceived as sanction to the respective family; and (iii) the
        understanding that all children have the same rights gained ground, as the service
        providers managed to integrate children in unfavorable situations;
     Change of approach of the responsible institutions involved in the child welfare,
        in the sense that they turned towards the community's problems, offering social



                                              18

        services in the specialized institutions, and assistance to and development of
        services for the reintegration of children in institutions;
     Appreciation of the increase in the quality of services provided, as most of the
        users witnessed, relating to the material assets, conditions and professional
        assistance.

The above mentioned assessment also revealed problems which have to be addressed
during the next period in order to ensure a more effective and efficient functioning of
these centers, such as:

     Interaction and relations among the representatives of all institutions operating in
        the field of social welfare suffered some times due to the different level of
        understanding of the reforms;
     Difficult and sometimes poor cooperation among the complexes and the
        institutions responsible for the child protection system administration, due mainly
        to the poorly harmonized legislation, regulating different areas of activity;
     Relatively low public awareness regarding the provision of the services offered by
        complexes, may impede the operation of the centers at full capacity.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

A major contribution to the sustainability of the services developed under the Project is
the adoption of the unified per capita financing standards for the new services which were
piloted under the Project (CSC, MBU and SCC). This implies, that the financing of this
type of services is an acknowledged state responsibility (as introduced and described in
the revised Implementing Regulations for the Social Assistance Act.), providing solid
ground for enhanced sustainability beyond the Project completion, as well as strong
incentives to the expansion of these services beyond the pilot municipalities.

The participatory approach in which the social services were designed and the good
results obtained in the first periods of community-based services functioning, led to
enhanced ownership and commitment both at the national and municipality levels, and
hence to the increase of the interest for the continuation and even expansion beyond the
Project completion.

Although, the institutional framework for the child protection system in Bulgaria has
been improved through the establishment of the SACP (as a specialized agency), the
overall structure of the system still remains complicated and fragmented across several
line ministries and agencies, making the coordination difficult in spite of the efforts made
by the National Council for Child Protection. After the EU accession (January 2007), the
institutional consolidation will likely be speeded up, and at the same time, the institutions
supported by the Project (such as SACP and CDPs) are expected to be given enhanced
autonomy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank's performance during the preparation of the project was satisfactory. The main
gaps of the country child protection system and opportunities for interventions were
properly identified, and the design of the project took into account the complexity of the
issue. The wide participatory approach undertaken during the project preparation phase
(involving the central and local Government representatives and various social service
providers (including NGOs sector representative) enabled the correct identification of
major risk factors. At the same time, most of the lessons learned from previous social
sector projects were considered and incorporated in the project design. The only issue,
which was not realistically appraised, was the overly optimistic timeframe of three years
originally set for the implementation of such a complex operation.

The close collaboration of the Bank with all the potential development partners, backed
up by the strong Government commitment to reforms, secured additional financial
support for both project preparation and implementation phases supporting the
investments in the soft areas such TA and training, as reflected in Annex 1 (Project Costs
and Financing).

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory.
Adequate budget and staff resources were allocated, and the Project was intensively
supervised and closely monitored. Extensive efforts were dedicated to undertake in-
depth field visits to the implementation sites and to conduct substantive dialog with all
stakeholders involved in the implementation of the Project activities. The task team
prepared regular supervision reports alerting the Government and the PMU on the
implementation bottlenecks, and facilitating timely remedies. Also, the Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) realistically assessed the project performance, from the angle of
both PDO and implementation.

The Bank team made greater than usual efforts to mobilize additional resources for
Technical Assistance (TA), e.g. municipal capacity building for the contracting out,
management, monitoring and evaluation was financed by a capacity building JSDF; the
piloting of early childhood initiatives and related capacity building was financed by
another JSDF grant; the Swiss Development cooperation and the UK Government
financed other consultants' contracts, etc.      This raises the question if TA was
underestimated at the design stage and the Bank team had to take mitigating efforts.




                                            20

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during the project preparation phase and supervision as
presented in Section 10.1, and as perceived by the Borrower's ICR, the Overall Bank
Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall sustained Government's commitment to reforming the child protection
system made possible the preparation and the successful implementation of the CWR
project, in spite of the delays that led to the extensions of the closing date. The changes
in the Government, during the project design and implementation phases, did not lead to
questioning the validity of the reforms supported by the CWR project. However, the
implementation was hampered at some stages, due to overall constrained fiscal space that
the Government faced, when priorities had to be revised and less budget support was
made available to the Project. Luckily this problem was solved in a relatively short
period of time and the Project implementation did not suffer too much.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy agreed to be the leading implementation agency
and to host the PMU.         This approach was beneficial to the satisfactory project
performance, as it gave weight and visibility to the Project and was supportive the
development of the new institutions responsible for the child protection at both central
and local/municipal levels, and ensured adequate political support for the promotion and
approval of the enabling legislative framework.

All the CWR Project activities were implemented under the direct guidance of the PMU
hosted in the MOLSP, close to the key senior decision makers in the social protection
area. The PMU was effective in carrying out all the aspects of the project management,
such as financial management (with the remark that that FM Information System was not
properly completed), procurement arrangements, reporting activities and disbursements.
The seriousness with which the project M&E activities were considered by the PMU can
be an example for many other similar projects.

The PMU acted during the entire implementation period not only as a management unit,
but also as a competent technical assistance unit, with staff highly specialized in many of
the technical areas of the project. The capacity developed in the PMU would be an




                                              21

important asset in the preparation and implementation of the proposed follow-up Bank
financed operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Borrower's performance during the project preparation phase and
supervision as presented in Section 10.1, the Overall Bank Borrower's Performance is
rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The implementation of the CWR project was a useful exercise for both Bank and
Government counterparts, in the sense that it allowed for some lessons to be learned,
which can be incorporated in the design of future projects as follows:

     Involvement of the NGO sector. The NGOs become more and more a reliable
       partner in both the design and provision of social services. However, their
       capacity is not always equally well developed across the country. Thus, before
       outsourcing these services to the NGOs, thorough assessment of their capacity
       and effectiveness has to be conducted, and if training needs are identified, they
       should be provided with.

     Dealing with new institutional arrangements. When new institutions are
       created at both national and local levels, a particular attention has to be paid to a
       clear definition of responsibilities between the new ones and the already existing
       one in the institutional landscape, to avoid possible institutional clashes that could
       hamper                      the                    reform                    process.

     Local Government Commitment. The sustained commitment of the local
       authorities (municipalities) is a pre-requisite for the successful implementation of
       the sub-projects in the local communities. This commitment has to be built up
       and secured well before their selection as partners in the project implementation is
       done.

     Implementation timeframe. The up-front acknowledgment of the project
       complexity, in the preparation process, has to be accompanied by a realistic
       implementation timeframe, to allow the proper achievement of the project
       objectives. In most of such cases, three year implementation period is not enough.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The MOLSP (on behalf of the Borrower) reviewed and provided comments on this ICR,
which were considered and appropriate changes were made wherever possible.



                                             22

Following the review of the ICR, the MOLSP sent a letter to the Bank, confirming its
agreement with the content of the report by stating that "The report provides clear and
objective overview of the project objectives, implementation and outcomes, as well as,
that the concluded need for continuity of the child welfare reform activities in Bulgaria,
corresponds to the Government's priorities in the social policy making". The letter
highlighted also the "excellent cooperation between the Bulgarian Government and the
Bank team under the CWR project".

(b) Cofinanciers

The discussions with the EU Delegation representatives involved in the project co-
financing and implementation, confirmed the positive results of the project
implementation, and the comments provided to the task team, were adequately
incorporated in the relevant sections of the ICR.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component I. Capacity Building (US$ 12.01 million).

Institutional Structures. As a prerequisite for project implementation, the following
structures were created in Bulgaria: (i) State Agency for Child Protection, (ii) National
Council for Child Protection and Child Protection Departments.

Since its creation, the SACP became the focal point for policy developments on child
welfare/protection area: developing framework standards for child protection services,
monitoring the observance of children rights and the quality of services provided to
children, and licensing the NGO service providers.

The NCCP represents the main dialogue structure, the advisory body of the SACP,
bringing together representatives of main actors involved in child welfare/protection
(MLSP, MOE, MOH, MOJ, NGOs).

The CPDs are the main administrative structures dealing with child welfare/protection
issues at local level. Initially they were created as departments within the Municipal
Social Assistance Services (structures administered and financed by the National Social
Assistance Services and the Municipal authorities). Beginning with January 2003, these
services were transferred as Directorates for Social Assistance (DSAs), incorporating the
CPDs, under the centralized responsibility of the MOLSP - Agency for Social Assistance.
CPDs were developed in all municipalities.

TA and Training. The newly developed structures benefited of an important volume of
training and technical support for capacity building, under the EU PHARE financed
CWR Twinning Program (EUR 3.5 million) with Austria which provided TA and
training for establishing and building the operating capacity of the SACP; developing
minimum standards for child welfare services; establishing the National Training Center
for Social Work; and strengthening the implementation capacity in 10 small pilot CPDs
(Dimitrovgrad, Vetovo, Dve Mogili, Berkovitsa, Lom, Boichinovtsi, Pomorie, Nessebur,
Karnobat and Sredetz).

The following training activities were carried out with the Bank financing:

     Social work training program (in 2 modules) for staff working with children and
        families for the Child Protection Departments; 179 CPD social workers, heads of
        CPDs, directors of DSAs and Regional DSAs from the 10 pilot municipalities of
        the WB financed project (Sofia, Ruse, Shumen, Targovishte, Varna, Burgas,
        Sliven, Stara Zagora, Plovdiv and Pazardjik), officials from MLSP, the ASA and
        the SACP. Training for 18 trainers was also delivered in the pilot CPDs, while
        training materials were disseminated to all CPDs across the country.




                                            26

    Social services management training (in 5 modules) was developed and delivered
       to 158 specialists from the pilot municipalities - directors of DSAs and RDSAs,
       heads of CPDs, social workers, middle-level units' heads from the MLSP, SACP
       and ASA.

    Training in Management and provision of community-based social services for
       children and families (in 5 modules), was developed and delivered to 160
       representatives of local authorities from the 28 districts, NGOs, providing services
       for children and families and staff of Complexes for Social Services.

    The PMU organized two training sessions under a mini program "Enhancing the
       Capacity in combating the Worst Forms of Child Labor of the Ten Centres for
       Social Services" within the joint project of MLSP and the International Labor
       Organization. The 50 trainees were representatives of municipal administrations,
       CPDs, Labor Bureaus and Complexes for Social Services from the pilot
       municipalities.

    Training for judges in children's rights protection was delivered to 17 judges from
       district courts and 20 judges from regional courts covering the pilot municipalities
       on topics related to adoption procedures, basic knowledge on child development
       and specifics, implementation of the principle for "best interest of the child", and
       cooperation with the social protection system. At the PSC meetings and at the
       project closing workshop MOJ representatives confirmed their intention to
       include a child protection module in the regular curriculum of the National
       Institute                                for                                Justice.

    Training on prevention of abandonment, prevention of violence and case
       management was delivered to 60 municipal child protection social workers from
       the following districts: Burgas, Pazardhik, Plovdiv, Ruse, Shumen, Sliven, Sofia,
       Stara Zagora, Targovishte and Varna.

Apart from the training, study visits and bilateral meetings were organized for
representatives of stakeholders on central and local levels:

    study visit for deputy minister of LSP, deputy director of ASA and deputy mayors
       from the pilot municipalities was conducted with the main purpose to familiarize
       with the principles and practices of outsourcing of social services in the
       Netherlands;
    study visit to the UK for representatives of municipal administration from the
       pilot municipalities and representatives of MLSP was organized under the main
       theme "community-based social services for children and families";
    three study-visits with the purpose of familiarization with the Romanian
       experience in social services for children were organized for CPDs and staff of
       Complexes for Social Services.




                                             27

Throughout the project implementation the PMU, with local and international consultants
support, provided TA both for the central level authorities (MLSP, ASA, SACP) and the
municipal level structures (DSAs, CPDs, Municipal Authorities, Service providers). The
PMU team and consultants were actively consulted and involved in drafting all legal and
regulatory framework related to child welfare (including the regulations regarding the
selection procedures for contracting the provision of services for children and families)
and protection and also provided monitoring, coaching and supervision in all aspects
related to developing and implementing the preventive and alternative services in the
pilot municipalities to all actors involved (DSA/CPDs, Service providing NGOs,
Municipal Authorities, ASA, SACP).

Public Awareness. Two information campaigns were prepared and implemented during
the Project:

     The first one, addressing information about the reform under the slogan "To every
       child with love and care" was launched in June 2003, covered national and
       regional levels and included the production and broadcasting of 1 video spots, 2
       radio spots and 5 educational films; the design, printing and distribution of 2
       posters in total print 15 000 and 2 brochures in total print 20 000. More than 20
       radio emissions covering child protection topics and issues were broadcasted on
       the National Radio station "Horizont". Eight regional reportages on the new
       alternative social services were broadcasted on the local cable TVs. Four regional
       meetings with representatives of the professional community and stakeholders
       were held in Ruse, Shoumen, Plovdiv and Stara Zagora. A photo exhibition "The
       Children of Life" was produced and inaugurated on the project closing
       conference, which took place on 9th June. The exhibition was also shown in the
       Parliament in July 2006. As part of the campaign two 2-day educational seminars
       on child protection issues for journalists were carried out.

     The second one launched in 2005, addressed the introduction of foster care
       services in Bulgaria. It consisted of producing and broadcasting of TV video-clips
       and radio spots, educational films, workshops and discussions with professionals,
       the public and journalists, and dissemination of printed materials (posters,
       leaflets). The campaign featured as well lobbying activities for foster care such as
       conducting a meeting of MPs with NGOs active in the foster care field. In
       addition sociological studies on public attitudes toward foster care were
       conducted.

Beneficiary and stakeholder assessments.           Five assessments were carried out
periodically: Baseline beneficiary assessment, Assessment of the impact of Component 3,
Assessment of the CPD's capacity in 11 municipalities.               Assessment of the
decentralization of services and Assessment of the Social Service Centers.

Monitoring and assessment. Monitoring of the results included various methods to cover
on one hand the achievement of indicators and on the other "softer" characteristics of the
reform such as municipal involvement in social service provision, cooperation on local



                                             28

level between stakeholders, trends in development of the Social Service Complexes. The
tracking of indicators was done through regular collection of child protection relevant
data from CPDs, Agency for Social Assistance, State Agency for Child Protection,
National Statistic Institute. The process of development of municipal social services was
monitored through on-site visits and meetings between representatives of PMU and
representatives of municipal authorities, CPDs, managerial and specialized staff of Social
Service Complexes.

Management Information System. IT equipment (1,200 work stations, 330 local servers,
550 printers and 281 switches) were procured and delivered to all DSAs in the country,
and MIS software was developed, installed and the training of the social workers
finalized. At the project completion date the software for the child protection part of the
MIS was testing corrections to respond to the latest amendments in the legal and
regulatory framework, and CPD social workers were trained for data entry and use.

Components II and IV  Deinstitutionalization (US$ 10.18 million) and Street
Children Services (US$ 3.34 million)

The outputs of these two components are discussed together because they followed the
same pattern and, wherever Component IV (street children services) have been developed
in the selected pilot municipalities, implementation was done jointly with the Component
II activities.

Development of social services. Prior the launching of the investments supporting the
establishment of the 10 Complexes for Social Services, each of the selected
municipalities developed and adopted municipal strategies for the development of
alternative community based social services for children and their families.          Ten
implementation agreements have been signed between the municipal authorities, MOLSP
and SACP, and 10 feasibility studies were concluded.

The Project financed works and goods for the refurbishment of 9 buildings and
construction of 10 new buildings for the 10 Complexes of Social Services that are
hosting: 10 Community Support Centers (CSC), 9 Mother and Baby Units (MBU) , and 5
Street Children Centers (SCC). In addition a separate center for street children was
refurbished in Sofia, to expand the services provided there. For the last 12 months of the
CWR project implementation the provision of services in the Complexes of Social
Services was contracted on a competitive selection process with 6 NGOs: National
Center for Social rehabilitation (Burgas, Varna, and Sofia), Consortium with leading
organization Institute for social services and practices (Pazardjik and Shoumen),
Consortium with leading organization CARE International Bulgaria (Ruse and Sliven),
Consortium with leading organization Every Child (Plovdiv), Consortium with leading
organization Samaritans (Stara-Zagora), and Consortium with leading organization
International Social Service (Targovishte).

A number of 3, 721 clients benefited from services provided in the Social Service
Complexes during the period of June 2005  May 2006. The breakdown of beneficiaries



                                            29

by main categories of services is as follows: 3,322 for CSC, 57 mothers and babies in
MBU and 104 children for SCC. At the same time a number of 423 street children were
returned to their families. These numbers could certainly be higher if all the works for all
the centers were completed in due time.

Starting with the closure date of the Project, in 9 out of the 10 pilot municipalities
services were further contracted out from NGOs on a competitive basis by the Municipal
Authorities (services were recognized as state delegated activities and funding is
provided by state subsidies based on agreed financial standards).            In one pilot
municipality, the authorities took over full administrative and management responsibility
for the services (funding ensured through the same state subsidy mechanism as
previously mentioned).

Restructuring of institutions and de-institutionalization. With the support provided by
the CWR project, the selected municipalities prepared and launched the restructuring and
de-institutionalization process. Thus 17 institutions have been selected for restructuring
in 8 pilot municipalities, for each of them having prepared restructuring plans by
consultants, feasibility studies carried out, and staff trained and counseled to adequately
cope with the post restructuring impact.       As a result, a number of 32 specialized
institutions for children have undergone assessment, and 1 institution has been
restructured. The restructuring process will continue beyond the CWR project completion.
The above mentioned restructuring plans are summarized below, for each of the 8 pilot
municipalities:

        and foster families.

At the end of the project the number of institutionalized children decreased in the pilot
municipalities (from 5,476 to 4,479) and well as country wide (from 30,751 to 23,688),
achieving thus the targets. However the de-institutionalization performance could have
been even better if the social services for children supported by the Project, were in place
earlier in the process, as initially envisaged.

Component III  Abandonment Prevention & Protection of Children's Rights
(US$ 1.72 million)

During the implementation period of June 2002  October 2003, 87 NGOs from the 10
pilot municipalities implemented 56 sub-projects with 4,102 children as direct
beneficiaries. The projects aimed at social integration and early childhood development
initiatives (equal start at school for children from disadvantaged communities). A total
number of 223 representatives of the communities took part in these projects. The
initiatives piloted by this sub-component were scaled up nationally and will likely be
continued and expanded with the proposed follow-up operation, Social Inclusion Project.

Under an agreement between the MOLSP and the Ministry of Interior, the component
funded the following activities, aiming at improving the work of the police with children:
- Refurbishment: repair works, furnishing and equipping of 202 child pedagogical units,
77 units for 24-hour detention and 5 homes for temporary placement;
- Training and capacity building: training of 225 officials of the Ministry of Interior under
the program for Police Outreach in Schools; training of 300 officials for work with
children; computer training for 281 police officers.

  ASSESSMENT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPLEXES FOR SOCIAL
                    SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

Study Description

The Assessment of the Activities of the Complexes for Social Services to Children and
Families Study was performed in May 2006 in the cities where such complexes for social
services to children and families (CSSCFs) exist, namely, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora, Varna,
Shumen, Turgovishte and Rousse. These municipalities were chosen to carry out pilot
studies on the organization and offering of comprehensive social services to children and
families at risk.

The basic aim of the study in question was to assess the efficiency of the complexes'
activities. The main tasks to be solved in order to achieve this aim were examining the:

     conditions in CSSCFs - human resources, material assets and activities;
     the relative place in the respective communities of the alternative social services
        to children and families;
     the interaction between the institutions within the system for children care and
        protection, as seen from the pint of view of the said complexes.

The methods used for information gathering were quantitative - polls, and qualitative - in-
depth interviews and focus groups.
The qualitative methods were used to study the opinion of:

     the CSSCF teams and Children Protection Departments (CPD) experts;
     the social services users in the CSSCFs;
     representatives of: families at risk, local authorities, institutions dealing with
        children, such as Regional Education Inspectorates (REI) at the Ministry of
        Education and Science (MES), the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Health, the
        Commission for Combating Anti-social Behavior, the Probation Service;
     the services specialized in children's problems.

The polls carried out were of two types and were used to gather objective information
concerning the activities of each of the complexes and to construct the profile of the
CSSCF employees, in terms of number, education, age and motivation.




                                             35

I. THE COMPLEXES - MATERIAL ASSETS, WORKING CONDITIONS AND
TEAMS, PRACTICES IN ACCEPTING USERS

1. Material assets and working conditions

The conditions in complexes are exceptionally good, not only in terms of the overall
parameters, such as, lighting, cleanliness, furnishing, but also bearing in mind the basic
activities, namely, work with children.       The comfortable conditions are among the
reasons why the users are coming to the complexes willingly and with pleasure. In fact,
such willingness is part of the guarantees for the CSSCFs effectiveness.

2. Team
As a rule, the CSSCF teams are comprised of very young people - this is the first
employment for most of them. In all such CSSCF teams, the personnel are hired
following an appropriate competition. The most important characteristics of those
working in the CSSCFs, besides the age (the average age being 28 years), is
professionalism - all possess suitable education and demonstrate strong motivation, more
than one-third consider this work as being a calling, while about 25 % see it as an
opportunity for personal and professional development.

The data gathered during the study indicate that the overall number of specialists
occupied in the complexes is 147. More than a half of them, namely 75, are social
workers; the psychologists are 18; the number of tutors is 11; while the specialized
pedagogues are 4. Other specialized personnel employed by the complexes are nurses (7),
accountants (7), one rehabilitator and one legal consultant. The technical personnel
comprise 17 persons, whose tasks include maintenance and repairs of the building and the
associated equipment.

3. Practices Concerning Enrolling CSSCFs Users

The nature of the CSSCF operation determines the strong ties between the CPDs and the
complexes. The CPDs issue instructions concerning each individual case, while the
CSSCFs provide the social care needed. Another institution empowered to send users is
the Commission for Combating Anti-social Behavior. It must be strongly emphasized
that in all of the six cities listed above the correct ways have been found of interacting
with the CSSCFs,with the focus placed on the children's best interests.

II. PROBLEMS IN THE CSSCFs ACTIVITIES

1. Short period of effective work

The period of effective work of CSSCF is extremely short - up to 7 months. This is in
fact the basic problem, from which all other problems arise. It is impossible to assess
realistically the effect of the complexes' operation.




                                             36

2. CPDs instructions

Many opinions were expressed to the effect that the practice of receiving instructions
from the CPDs must be changed. The basic reasons are: the excessive workload of the
CPDs employees and the insufficient competence of some of them. Among the rest of
the reasons we should mention the lack of motivation and the formal approach to giving
instructions.

The problem of instructions is related to the incorrect choice of users. There have been
cases of neglected signals for grave family problems, such as abuse and poverty.

3. Problems in the interaction between the main institutions operating in the
network of social care for children at risk

The main reason for the poor cooperation between the complexes and the institutions is
the poorly coordinated legislation. This is the source of tensions between them, in certain
cases even of struggle for supremacy and of senseless accusation for usurpation of
powers. The result is a feeling of the existence of chaos, not only among the wider
societal strata, but also among the experts. This situation opens up possibilities for
shifting duties and responsibilities, as well as for increasing the role of the personal factor
to an intolerable level.

4. Lack of CSSCFs popularity within the community

The wide public is not well informed about the complexes' activities, which is an
impediment to their operation at full capacity. The complexes' representatives explain
this lack of popularity with the potential users' lack of abilities of using social services, as
well as with the short period of CSSCFs operation.


III. SUCCESSES IN THE CSSCFs ACITIVITIES

The successes in the CSSCFs operation must be considered in two directions. The first
deals with the specificities of operation, the other has to do with the principles of and the
changes resulting from the implementation of the Increasing the Welfare of Bulgarian
Children Project, which began in 2001.

1. Specific successes in the CSSCFs operation

During the six months of CSSCFs operation in the six pilot municipalities, 15 types of
social services were developed to a different degree. These were as follows: family
consulting, pre- and post-natal care, reintegration, work with children with deviant
behavior, prevention of school drop-out, assistance to children with anti-social behavior,
emergency acceptance, independent life training, family planning, prevention of violence,
foster families training, assistance to adoptive parents, hot telephone line, assistance to
single mothers, work with street children.



                                              37

As of the moment of performing the present study, the complexes have dealt with more
than 1500 cases, all of which have been solved. This is the main reason why the CSSCFs
enjoy a high degree of approval of their operation by the social services users.

The opinion of the CPD experts is the second most important factor. We should note
here that the CPDs stand unequivocally by their colleagues from the CSSCFs.

The opinion of the representatives of the municipalities-partners in the present project
clearly shows that they are strongly motivated to continue providing social services to
children and families.

2. Successes of Increasing the Welfare of Bulgarian Children Project

First among the project successes is the change in the communities' attitude to the
children's problems. This is a comprehensive change that was manifested along several
directions.

Firstly, when dealing with children's problems, the emphasis has shifted from the family
to the child itself. The persons studied share spontaneously the opinion that the care of
the child must be provided by the community, rather than by the individual family.

Secondly, the attitude to receiving social services has changed. The intervention of a
specialist in solving problems related to children is no longer perceived as a sanction to
the respective family.

Thirdly, the understanding has gained ground that all children must enjoy the same rights.
The foundations have been laid of integrating children in unfavorable situation, such as
children with impairments, children with deviant behavior, Roma children, etc.

In second place among the project successes we should note the change in the attitude of
the various institutions. These can be summarized broadly in three groups, namely, the
institutions turning towards the community's problems, offering of social services in the
specialized institutions, and assistance to and development of services for reintegration of
children in institutions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Conclusions

     The material assets of and the conditions in the CSSCFs are adequate to the social
        services they offer;
     The highest marks of the CSSCFs operation is given by the social services users.
     A notable change in attitudes is registered in the specialized institutions for
        children. Intensive effort there is directed to offering alternative services to
        children at risk.




                                             38

    The study unequivocally registers a change in the community's attitudes to novel
      ways in offering social services to children and families at risk.
    The study registers an increased sensitivity among the population to the children's
      problems, as compared with that observed by the date of the project's beginning in
      2001.
    The good interaction and positive relations between the representatives of all
      institutions, operating in the field of children protection, are of paramount
      importance for the future development of good practices in social services usage.
    The CSSCFs activities are not known to the wide public. The reasons may be
      sought both in the relatively recent establishment of CSSCFs, and in the
      population's inertness in what concerns receiving social services.
    The established practice of users acceptance consists in receiving instructions
      from the CPDs, from the Commission for Combating Anti-social Behavior, and
      directly in the CSSCFs. It is assumed that the latter type of users' acceptance will
      prevail in the future.
    The CSSCFs consist entirely of young people with suitable education, good
      professionalism, who are ambitious and strongly motivated. This fact is among
      the greatest successes of the CSSCFs.
    Representatives of the groups studied exhibit a positive attitude to the CSSCFs
      future. Everyone recognizes the CSSCFs importance. The doubts expressed have
      to do with the possibility of their future financial support.

2. Recommendations

    The future work with the teams of the institutions specialized in children's care
      must be directed to breaking the existing frameworks, to offering social services
      and to utilizing the experience of the personnel.
    Mobile teams must be organized and used to popularize the operation; reaching
      isolated communities is an urgent task.
    Unambiguous criteria must be developed concerning the selection of CSSCFs
      services users.
    The development and supply is necessary of social services to children and
      families at risk in smaller municipalities.
    Coordination and cooperation must be established between all institutions
      working in the field of children and families at risk.
    Efficient channels must be found to inform the wide public about the social
      services offered by the CSSCFs. This must include bringing the services near the
      users by using mobile teams and more efficient work in schools, as well as
      organizing meetings with mayors and municipal social workers.

               BULGARIAN GOVERNMENT'S CONTRIBUTION TO
                          THE CHILD WELFARE REFORM
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT AND


1. Assessment of the project's objective, design, implementation, and operational
experience.

The Child Welfare Reform Project was launched to support the already started by the
Bulgarian Government reform of the child protection system.         Bulgaria ratified the
Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, thus starting the process of harmonizing
the national legislation with the international standards and agreements in this field.
The main aim of the reform was to protect the best interest of the child and their right to
live in a family environment. This aim was fully supported by the implementation of the
Child Welfare Reform Project targeted at the establishment of a system of community
based services, which would support the families in raising their children and thus
reducing the number of children in residential care.

1.1. Compliance and contribution of the Child Welfare Reform Project to the
Government policy for the reform of the child protection system

The project design and the activities, envisaged for its implementation reflected the idea
of an overall reform in the child protection system.

1.1.1. Component 1 "Capacity Building"

First - by creating and developing of the capacity of the protection system.          The
conditions for launching the project were the following:

     Adoption of the Child Protection Act (CPA);
     Establishment on the 1 of January of the State Agency for Child Protection
        (SACP);
     Child Protections Departments (CPD).

These structures were established, however in the beginning the CPDs were present in
only some of the larger municipalities, and since 2003 such departments have been
established in all Bulgarian municipalities. Beside the activities under the Twining
project, funded by the European Union, under the World Bank loan a series of activities
had been funded for the development of the capacity of the system and the policy in this
field .

The main being:




                                             41

- Development of a training programe in social work for the CPDs. In the period July
2002 - June 2004, this training was delivered to 179 social workers, heads of CPDs,
directors of Social Assistance Directorates (SAD) and Regional Social Assistance
Directorates (RSAD) from the ten project pilot municipalities, Ministry of Labor and
Social Policy (MLSP), Social Assistance Agency (SAA) and SACP employees. Trainers
in the pilot municipalities have been trained and the training materials were distributed in
all the CPDs in the country.

- Management of Social Work training was organized, which was delivered to 158
specialists - SAD, RSAD, CPD directors, social workers from the pilot municipalities,
middle management from the MLSP, SAA, SACP.

- A Social Assistance and Child Tracking Management Information System software was
developed. Computers were purchased and delivered to all SAD in the country. The
Social Assistance module was installed and the training of social workers was completed.
The Child Tracking module was installed, national adoption database was established.

- In June 2003 the Public Awareness Campaign started, and in 2005 - the foster care
campaign. It consisted of educational documentaries, TV and Radio broadcasts and spots
aired by the national electronic media. Seminars and discussions with specialists,
representatives of the public and journalists were organized. Printed materials were
distributed.

- A training on solving cases related to child protection for the judges from District and
Regional Courts was organized and delivered. The training included judges from the ten
pilot municipalities (17 from District Courts and 20 from Regional Courts). The training
was organized together by the MLSP, SACP and the National Justice Institute.

- In June 2006 started the training "Management and provision of social services to
children and families" for the municipal administration representatives from the 28
regional centres in the country, representatives of NGOs providers of child services and
representatives of the newly established Complexes for Family and Child Social Services
(CSSCF) in the pilot municipalities. Some 160 people attended this training.

1.1.2. Component 2 "Deinstitutionalisation" and Component 4 "Street Children
Services"

Second, main achievement of this project is the establishment of Complexes for Family
and Child Social Services (CFCSS) in the 10 pilot municipalities. They offer to the
community a lot of new - both in their content and scope - services and very soon were
recognized as an established model.

The CFCSS were established in partnerships with the municipal administrations and the
main local partners. Their development started immediately after the risk groups needs
assessment and the drafting of the municipal strategies for the development of social
services for children and families. The model of these municipal strategies and the need



                                            42

for drafting such strategies was later adopted in the Implementing Regulations of the
Child Protection Act.    The local authorities provided land and/or buildings for the
development of the CFCSS in the ten pilot municipalities.

Design projects were produced on the basis of the Feasibility Studies carried out and
following tender procedures started the construction and refurbishment works for the ten
CFCSS. For the built up and refurbished CFCSS furniture and equipment was procured
and delivered.

Following competitive tenders contracts were signed with NGOs - service providers. In 4
of the municipalities (Plovdiv, Ruse, Sliven and Shumen) the contracts were funded with
loan resources, in other 6 - with the Bulgarian co-financing for the project. The contracts
were for only 1 year, a relatively short period, however efficient enough for the
development and establishment of the new social services.

Community Support Centres (CSC) offer a wide range of services to support children
and families in the following areas:

     Prevention of abandonment and abuse of children;
     Foster care and adoption;
     Reintegration of children from specialized institutions and life skills training;
     Prevention of deviant behaviour and work with deviant children;
     Prevention of school dropping out.

Mother and Baby Units (MBU) offer services for prevention of abandonment of newly
born babies. They provide to the young single mothers and pregnant women for whom
there is a risk to abandon their children an opportunity for a short-term accommodation.
Some work is done for the development of the attachment between the mother and the
child and developing the mother's skills for independent living.

The Street Children Centres (SCC) offer services for taking children back to school,
healthcare services, development of social skills of children who temporarily or
permanently live on the streets.

Since the beginning of July 2005 till the end of May 2006 in the CFCSS in the ten pilot
municipalities services were provided to some 3 721 clients, out of which in CSC - 3 322,
in MBU - 57 mothers and babies, and in the SCC - 104.

The project idea envisaged also support for the restructuring of the specialized
institutions, where the number of children has been considerably reduced as a result of
the development and delivery of community-based services. The project timeframe
however did not allow the needed sequence of the activities, and they had to be
implemented simultaneously.

32 institutions were assessed in 2003. Out of these institutions 17 from 8 municipalities
were selected for restructuring, i.e. to develop alternative social services. The plans for



                                            43

their restructuring were developed as well as feasibility studies for the needed works,
related to the improvement of the equipment and the premises. A methodology was
developed, which was later used for the development of the SACP methodology for the
assessment of all specialized child-care institutions in the country in 2004, as well as in
the Criteria for restructuring, reformation and closing down specialized institutions,
adopted by the Ministers of Labor and Social Policy, Education and Healthcare in 2006.

The UK Department for International Development (DFID) funded a training needs
assessment for the staff, employed in these institutions, as well as technical assistance
and training.

After discussions at the Project Steering Committee the activities for restructuring of the
institutions were very much reduced, due to the need for amending various statutory
documents. At the end of the day the restructuring was implemented only in Shumen
Home for Disabled Children "Kalinka". Room was provided for work with the families
and for specialized activities with children, additional staff was employed, short staff
trainings were organized.


1.1.3. Component 3 "Abandonment Prevention & Protection of Children's Rights"

A. Child development in disadvantaged communities

Within this component, based on the pilot projects models, funded by other donors, were
funded projects for pre-school education, delivered by local organizations, who worked
for the provision of equal start in school for children from high risk communities.

The implementation of this component, funded with Japanese Social Development Fund
(JSDF) grant allowed the experts to learn several lessons:

- undoubtedly higher efficiency of NGOs compared to the budget structures, therefore
their need to establish public-private partnerships;
- NGO performance is characterized by high flexibility and capacity to implement
innovative approaches;
- the work with local organizations guarantees higher commitment to the local problems
and sustainability of the achieved outcomes.
- the prevention of school dropping-out interventions are more efficient compared to
bringing the already dropped-out children back to school;
- the main guarantee for the success of such projects is the constant work with the parents,
performed mainly by members of the same communities, which are involved in the
project implementation.




B. Protection of children's rights




                                              44

Within this sub-component, which provided funding for activities meant to improve the
work of the police with the children, have started the changes in the police approach to
children. Some investments in the premises and trainings allowed the police to fully play
its role as a Protection Body as provided for in the Child Protection Act.

1.2. The added value of the project regarding the implementation of the reform of
the child protection system.

As seen from the above, during the whole project implementation period it fully complied
with and supported the Government deinstitutionalization policy, the creation of a
protection system, which would guarantee observing the children's rights on the one hand,
and on the other - a system which allows efficient and effective spending of public funds.
During its implementation the project had a significant added value - it not only funded
the development of new social services, but it provided a considerable technical
assistance, and what is really important, it started many new initiatives and legislative
changes.

1.2.1. Legislative changes

The most important areas, where the project has contributed significantly, are:

-       The development of standards for child social services. Since mid 2002 Bulgaria,
represented by the State Agency for Child Protection was a pilot country under the World
Bank and UNICEF Project "Changing Minds, Policies and Lives". Under this project a
handbook for standards development was tested and the real development of standards
for child social services started, which was completed with the adoption of the Ordinance
on the Criteria and Standards for Child Social Services.

-       Introduction of a license regime for the providers of child social services. During
the process of implementing the abovementioned project it was proposed to introduce
licensing of all service providers. Licensing was introduced as a function of the SACP
Chairperson following the amendments of the Child Protection Act in 2003.

-       Introducing the procedure of contracting out the service provision.             The
contracting out procedure for social services was introduced in the Social Assistance Act
and its Implementing Regulations.

-       Introducing the case management mechanism in the CPDs. With the amendments
in the Implementing Regulations of the Child Protection Act in 2003 the case
management procedure was introduced in the CPD.

-       Introduction of unified standard for funding social services. Council of Ministers'
Decision (CMD) 426 of June 2006 approved the financial standards for the client
allowance in a Community Support Centre, a Mother and Baby Unit and a Day Street
Children Centre. This decision guaranteed the state subsidy for the maintenance of the




                                             45

CFCSS in the pilot municipalities, where the service is provided by a specialized service
provider, and also the multiplication of the model.

-       Development of a methodology for assessment of specialized child-care
institutions and initiating the development of a plan for reducing the number of children
placed in specialized institutions (mentioned in Component 2).          The activities for
restructuring the specialized institutions within the framework of this project started in
the beginning of 2003.       In order to prepare the restructuring, assessments of the
institutions were carried out. The methodology developed then is now used for the
national assessment of institutions in the country and in developing criteria for reforming,
restructuring and closing down specialized child-care institutions.

-       Regulating the relationships between CPDs and providers of social services.
When amending the Implementing Regulations of the Child Protection Act in 2006, on
the basis of the experience gathered by the project, more detailed regulations were
adopted to regulate the relationship between the CPDs and service providers in case
management, which also reflected the real practice.

-       The project implementation and the problems, related to the social practice,
revealed by this process, served as a basis for series of methodological guidelines, issued
by the SACP and the SAA.

-       In 2003, through amendment of the Public Education Act, pre-school education
was declared mandatory for all children in the country.

1.2.2. Introduction of new institutional practices

This project contributed considerably to the development of the inter-institutional
cooperation and coordination of the policies regarding children, as described in item 3.
It is of key significance that in the course of project implementation many central and
local institutions were involved - ministries, institutions, municipalities NGOs,
communities, etc. The project implementation resulted in a considerable improvement of
the capacity and commitment of local authorities to manage child social services. Rise
was given to the development of some horizontal cooperation in the field of child
protection.

And last, but not least, this project provided stable foundation for the public-private
partnerships in the field of child social services, as well as a strong impetus for the
development of the social services market.         The experience from the contracting
procedures and management of social services will be widely used in the future MLSP
activity.




                                             46

1.3. Project duration

Proposed by the MLSP the original project deadline has been extended twice. This
extended deadline allowed for the smooth project implementation, without any serious
cataclysms, which led to the gradual development of the capacity of the system (SACP,
CPD, municipal administrations, NGO sector), which then was very actively involved in
social services provision, and in turn created guarantee for maintaining their quality after
the end of the project.

The implementation of the project within the initially planned 3 years was not realistic,
bearing in mind the technological time, needed for the implementation of each of the
steps, as described in the Project Implementation Manual and the WB procurement
procedures.

1.4. Institutional arrangements

This project was implemented with the support of an investment loan and initially 79%
percent of the loan funds were directed to investment costs. Bearing in mind that the
initial investment costs are among the basic prerequisites for the development of
alternative social services, this loan was extremely appropriate. On the other hand, due to
the shortage of funds for technical assistance, training and service delivery, additional
financial sources had to be identified and provided, as well as some redistribution of loan
funds was needed.

The procurement procedures have been conducted in accordance with the WB rules.
They were managed by the PMU, but MLSP, SACP, SAA and municipal authorities
representatives were included in the evaluation panels. Given the capacity MLSP has
built in the last years in conducting procurement procedures, as well as the amendments
to the national legislation, it would be more appropriate for future projects to be
implemented using national procedures.

One of the main recommendations regarding future projects is the delegation of more
rights and responsibilities to the municipal authorities, which would create conditions for
faster project implementation by achieving higher level of commitment.

2. Assessment of the outcome of the project against the agreed objectives

As specified under item 1: The Government accepts that the project objectives have been
fulfilled in general. Moreover, it underlined the significant value added the government
"earned" due to the project implementation. In the view of all participants in the process
the project was not only supporting the reform but practically became "engine" of the
reform.

An evidence for the achievement of project objectives is the performance of the key
indicators for project results (see enclosed table).




                                              47

As the table shows only five of totally 14 impact indicators have not been fully achieved.
The visible trend is of reduction of the number and the rate of children in institutional
care (indicator 1). An evidence of the project impact is greater reduction in the number
of children at institutions in the pilot municipalities compared to the average country rate
(indicator 7). This fact we can explain with 1) the creation of the new services, 2) the
active work for the capacity strengthening of the CPDs, which gradually have expanded
the scope of their work (indicator 14), 3) the development of inter-institutional
cooperation and the public awareness campaign, which was carried out more actively in
the pilot municipalities (indicator 5).

Although the objective 30% of the placements of children outside the biological families
of CPDs in the pilot municipalities to be in family environment (indicator 14) has not
been achieved, the data shows the exclusively positive trend of reduction of the number
of children in residential care (indicator 8). This fact corresponds to the intention to
finance and develop under the project mainly services related to prevention of
abandonment of children at institutions as a more efficient measure than the re-
integration activities.

Even more important is the fact that the reduction of the share of institutionalized
children at the earliest age (0-3 years) is bigger as compared to the entire child population
with regard to institutions where the placement is according to the procedure of CPA
(indicator 3). This comes to show the achievement of project objectives whose target
group were exactly the children in that age group.

The information on financial dimensions of the alternatives - family care and specialized
institutional care (indicator 4) - where the advantage of raising a child in alternative
family even financially turned to be absolute.

The indicators which have not be fully achieved outline the future work of the
government: 1) developing the professional foster care, which would increase the share
of children raised in a family against those raised in residential care (indicator 2 and 14);
2) decentralization and restructuring of specialized child-care institutions and
strengthening the role of CPDs and the private services providers therein (indicator 13).

The data related to indicator 12 shows that street children have not had access to
healthcare in the centres, which work with them. We should note though that since 2003
the healthcare for all children in Bulgaria is free, regardless of whether their parents have
paid their health insurance contributions. On the other hand it is exactly the inclusion of
the rest of the systems - education and healthcare - which is one of the main targets of the
reform, so as to establish a real child welfare system.

3. Evaluation of the Government's own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the project with emphasis on lessons learned

3.1. Project management structures

Project leader

According to the project documentation, it was managed by MLSP. The project leader
was a deputy minister in charge of social assistance and social services. In this respect the
project differs from other international projects of MLSP, which were managed by a
deputy minister in charge of international relations. This approach allowed a greater
commitment by the ministry and active dialogue with regard to the implementation of
child protection and welfare system reform, supported by the project. Thus the project
was actually used in support of the ongoing reform, whereas on the one hand the actions
implementation was corresponding to the actual situation, and on the other the proposals
for further changes ensuing from the project implementation were directly communicated
to the political level and even caused amendments of laws. We should note that for the
period August 2003 - August 2005, the project manager was the then minister of labor
and social policy (the only project in the ministry from numerous international projects to
be managed directly by the minister).        This supported both the necessary synergy
between the project and the reform mentioned above and the provision of the necessary
co-financing by the Bulgarian Government, even further supported with additional
Council of Ministers Decrees.

Project Steering Committee

Since the reform supported by the project concerned the overall child protection system,
the Project Steering Committee included deputy ministers of the concerned ministries
(MES, MH, MIA, MJ, MoF) and the Chairperson of the State Agency for Child
Protection. Unfortunately they were not always present at the meetings and did not
support enough the activities related to the restructuring of their subordinated specialized
institutions (MES and MH). On the other hand, the Steering Committee meetings often
passed discussing problems and issues not directly concerning the project implementation
and concerning the reform as a whole.

Project Management Unit

A Project Management Unit managed the project on operational level. Some of the
experts of the unit were recruited during the period of preparation of the loan agreement,
and thus on the project launch they already worked as a well-established team. The unit
had to recruit additional experts in the course of the project depending on the needs (e.g.
the second procurement expert). All appointments were performed in compliance with
the tender procedures of the World Bank. The qualification of PMU members was
upgraded through additional MLSP financed training. There were some positive and
some negative points resulting from the project management by this specifically
established unit. The risk is that after the project completion and ceasing the PMU



                                             49

activities, MLSP will loose a large part of the capacity built. On the other hand the
existence of an independent unit of experts in the field allowed the more efficient and
quality project implementation. Just because its independent status, the PMU experts
were integrated sufficiently into the MLSP structures and activities (an evidence to that
effect is their participation in the development of legislative documents, projects and
programs) and on the other hand they were providing an external view on the reform
process. Through this special status of relatively integrated/independent experts, PMU
contributed also for the capacity building at MLSP in the child protection field.

3.1. Project financing

In whole the project implementation ran relatively smoothly when the necessary financial
resources were promptly provided. Initially the cost ceiling for 2004, 2005 and 2006,
both concerning the loan but mainly the Bulgarian co-financing, was insufficient with
view to implementation of planned activities and therefore it was necessary to find
additional funds. For the years 2004 and 2005 this was done trough the adoption of
special CMDs and for 2006 there was internal budget reallocation within the MLSP
budget.

The scope of the Bulgarian co-financing was significantly expanded against the initial
plan. The total size of the counterpart funds reached 7 191 342 Euro. The co-financing
covered 11,1% of the civil works costs, 24,5% of the goods purchasing and 61% of the
costs of services.

Apart of the additional republican budget funds additional sources of financing were
sought. The PMU activities for 2003-2004 were financed with a donation of the Swiss
Agency for Cooperation and Development amounting to USD 78,600. A UK DfID grant
financed the training need analysis for the staff of 17 specialized child-care institutions
and later on the very training. The Japanese Social Development Fund grant for local
government capacity building for provision of social services, requested by the World
Bank from MLSP, still provides financing for the technical assistance and training at
local level.

3.2. Implementation of the Reform in the Child Protection System

Fulfilling the agreements on project preparation, a State Agency for Child Protection was
established as an independent body, responsible for the policymaking and coordination,
related to child protection. After its establishment and having made certain amendments
in the Child Protection Act, its obligations include the creation of standards for child
social service, monitoring of these standards and licensing regime for the child social
service providers.

Child     Protection    Departments      were    established    in   all    municipalities.
Having identified the need during the interim project review, a pilot training for judges
was organized jointly by MLSP, SACP and the National Justice Institute.
The Government made series of amendments of regulations, which were on the one hand



                                             50

initiated by the project team during the implementation, but on the other hand are proof
of commitment and created conditions for the successful project implementation,
expressed by:

     Created child social services standards,
     Introduced case management procedures at the Child Protection Departments,
     Introduced social service contracting procedure,
     Introduced unified financing standards for state-delegated activities of the
        Community Support Centres, Mother and Baby Units and the Day Street Children
        Centres,
     Introduced mandatory preschool attendance,
     Amendments of the legislation concerning foster care.

The decentralization of specialized institutions for children at MES and partially those at
MH, as stipulated in the project documentation, will be implemented starting 2007.

4. Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, other financing institutions or
partners during the preparation and implementation of the project, including the
effectiveness of their relationships, with an emphasis on the lessons learned

As we mentioned, the successful project implementation is due to a large extent to the
established practice of equal partnership and equal commitment of a number of
institutions. This statement is especially valid in the case of the relations with the World
Bank.

4.1. Project preparation

The project preparation pooled the efforts of international and local experts and
representatives of the state institutions. The first National Strategy and Action Plan for
Child Protection were created in the course of the project preparation.           The Child
Protection Act was adopted with the support of the World Bank. A Social Assessment of
the Child Care in Bulgaria was conducted with the joint financing by the World Bank and
UNICEF. It was the first to describe and analyze the protection system and provided
exceptionally important information for the shaping the field of work of the new State
Agency for Child Protection. Even today this assessment serves as benchmark for the
forthcoming changes.

4.2. Project implementation

During the project implementation the role of the World Bank's team was not the
traditional one - as a controlling institution - but much more as a partner helping find
jointly solutions for many cases - related to programming, tendering, financial
management, etc.

The supervision missions for the project gave opportunity for a snapshot analysis of the
degree of implementation, outlining potential problems and their timely solution.



                                             51

The PMU capacity was built with the World Bank support by including the team in
training and providing regular TA for 5 years. The training of judges started after the
midterm review of the project.       The quality enhancement review helped making a
decision to reduce the volume of activities related to the restructuring of specialized
child-care institutions and reallocation of thus released funds to financing of social
services.

As we mentioned above, the introduction of social service standards and licensing is a
result   of    the   pilot    project   "Changing     Minds,      Policies  and    Lives".
The second JSDF grant covered a significant deficit for the project. The provision of
regular technical assistance to pilot municipalities helped the prompt launch of the new
social services. Moreover, the training courses for representatives of municipalities and
NGOs from all over the country multiply the pilot municipalities' practices with regard to
the    type     of    social    services    and     the    their    practical   provision.
The dialogue with the World Bank was performed not only within this project but also
within the PAL, whose matrix included the continuation of the reforms in the system of
child protection and the development of community-based social services.

5. Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project

The Complexes for Family and Child Social Services established under the project were
transferred for management by municipal administrations in nine of the ten pilot
municipalities (in the last one by the end of 2006, the contract financed by MLSP). New
tenders were announced in eight municipalities, based on the Implementing Regulations
of the Social Assistance Act and contracts were signed with social service providers for
3-5 years. Seven of the municipalities retained their old service providers. The Complex
in one of the municipalities is managed directly by the municipal administration.

The Complexes for Family and Child Social Services were financed thorough the
financial standards for state-delegated activities. In 2005, during the preparation of
budget 2006, funds were allocated for the ten complexes, where the new services used the
standards of other standards. In 2006 a Working Group within MLSP developed and
proposed to the MoF new standards for Community Support Centre, Mother and Baby
Unit and Day Street Children Centre. These standards were approved with a decision of
the Council of Ministers of June 2006. For the first time the country saw introduced
unified client allowance standards, as to oppose the practice of splitting the funds into
"salaries" and "means of substance".       The introduction of unified standards helped
overcome the obstacles to the contracting out of social services provision to external
providers.

The new services were regulated also by their inclusion into the Implementing
Regulations of the Social Assistance Act.           These legislative amendments (the
Implementing Regulations of the Social Assistance Act and the financial standards)
created prerequisites and opportunities for the other municipalities to also start offering
the same services.




                                            52

MLSP will continue monitoring the development of services and provide support for their
improvement and management both to the providers and the municipal administrations,
by retaining part of the Project Management Unit by the end of 2007. The project
implementation experience will be also used in the preparation and implementation of the
social inclusion loan, targeted at children from poor families.
