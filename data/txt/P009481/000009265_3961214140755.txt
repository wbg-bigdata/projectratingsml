FOURTH FLOOD CONTROL AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(Credit 1784-BD
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fourth Flood Control and
Drainage Project in Bangladesh, for which Cr. 1784-BD in the amount of SDR16.6 million (US$20.0
million equivalent at that time) was approved on April 28, 1987 and made effective on February 12,
1988.
The project was designed to be implemented over 7 years (1987 - 1993); 4 years on
construction and 3 years building a sustainable project specially O&M capability within the Bangladesh
Water Development Board (BWDB). In actuality it took 8 years to complete construction allowing
little time to initiate O&M operations during the project period.
The Credit (Cr. 1784-BD) was closed with one year delay on December 31, 1994.
Towards the end of FY1992, an amount of SDR4.36 million out of the Credit was reallocated for the
rehabilitation of coastal embankments and related structures damaged during the cyclone of April
1991. (This work financed from this credit, three other credits, and Japanese and European
Community Grants, will be covered in a separate ICR) Still, there was an unspent balance of SDR
1.36 million and which was cancelled effective April 30, 1995. Co-financing for the project was
provided by the European Union for technical assistance.
This ICR was prepared by a mission' from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme
which visited Bangladesh from March 14 to March 30, 1995.1 It is based on material in the project
files at the Bank office in Dhaka. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
submitting all data required, and subscribing to the contents of the Aide-Memoire.

FOURTH FLOOD CONTROL AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(Credit 1784-BD)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.        The Fourth Flood Control and Drainage Project (FCD IV) as well as several on-going
projects at the time, including three supported by IDA credits (Cr.864-BD for FCD I, Cr. 1184-BD for
FCD II and Cr. 159 1-BD for FCD EI), were similar in their objectives and were designed to assist the
Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) policy of promoting full use of the productive potential of the
country's scarce land resources by controlling floods, improving drainage and increasing access to
irrigation. FCD IV was to be under the same management as FCD III (Cr. 1591 -BD) and as in the case
of the latter project, its feasibility study was financed by IDA's fourth technical assistance credit and
prepared by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) with the assistance of the
Netherlands Development Consultants (NEDECO). This feasibility study was the basis for the Bank
appraisal.
Project Objectives
2.        Project objectives included protection against crop losses, loss of life and property
damage due to floods and to improve the physical environment for better agricultural practices in a
gross area of 63,100 ha in Rajshahi and Natore Districts in the North-Western Region of Bangladesh.
The project was also to strengthen BWDB's implementation capacity. To achieve these objectives, the
project included: (i) construction and rehabilitation of embankments, water control structures, drainage
channels, and upgrading of roads; (ii) support to BWDB to improve the planning, design, and
monitoring of FCD projects, and to improve land acquisitions and operation and maintenance; and
(iii) the preparation of programmes for the development of agriculture and fisheries within the project
area and three adjacent polders.
3.         The project objectives were clear, realistic and important to protect cropped areas, as well
as people and their properties from floods, and to promote increased food production. No changes in
the original project objectives occurred during implementation, although engineering designs prepared
after the project's approval led to modification or omission of certain infrastructure works that were
initially envisaged under the SAR. Some of these changes resulted in cost increases and others in cost
reductions. For example, cost savings have been due to the reduction in drainage canals (from 465 km
to 262 kin), irrigation inlets (from 50 to 32), and water control structures (from 27 to 17), whereas a
cost increase has been due to the increase in road coverage (from 67 km to 127 k1m).



iii
4.         Although special covenants, such as to ensure timely acquisition of land for construction
works, were included in the DCA, their effectiveness has been mixed. The covenant to accelerate land
acquisition and project implementation (DCA Section 3.03) was only partly complied with and did not
lead to expected results as was the experience under FCD Im (Cr. 159 1-BD). Most other covenants
were either partly complied or complied with delay.
Implementation and Results
5.        The physical components of the project achieved their development objectives as set by
the SAR. The institutional development components are more difficult to judge, since improvements in
capabilities and processes were not specified with precision. While some strengthening may have been
achieved, the weaknesses in BWDB's implementation maintenance and monitoring performance
remain as serious issues. It should be noted that the strengthening of BWDB has been a continuing
process also funded by the two preceding IDA projects (Cr.864-BD and Cr.1 184-BD) concurrently
pursued under FCD III - Cr. 1591-BD (see Part II, Table 2), and currently being supported under the
Systems Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2099-BD).
6.        The principal and most important unfavourable impact of FCD-IV concerns the project's
adverse effect on flood plain fisheries in the project area. GOB's main concern and priority at the time
(as supported by most of the donors) of protecting farm lands from floods to increase food production
seemed to have overshadowed the need for timely introduction of suitable measures to mitigate this
adverse impact. An attempt to neutralise this effect is now being made by a fish culture program in the
polders. The expected development of fish culture may eventually compensate for the reduction in
flood plain fish supply but it would not fully compensate for the loss of income of those fishermen who
belong to the socially lowest population stratum in Bangladesh. Introduction of fish culture would not
also help mitigate the environmental concems over diminution of fish species, claimed to be due to the
water flow obstruction caused by the embankments. In this situation, GOB should actively pursue and
ensure that the recommendations emanating from the project-supported Agricultural and Fishery
Development Studies (para. 19 of Part I) and any further follow-up recommendations to redress this
issue that are available, are fully implemented as part of post-project operations plan.
7.        Maintenance of structures is the responsibility of BWDB. This at present is being hardly
done. Similarly, no routine maintenance work has been carried out of the embankment and of
embankment roads. Seven years were originally planned for project implementation, of which four
were intended for the construction of infrastructure and three for O&M of project works. However, it
took the entire seven years of original project period plus one year of the extended period to complete
construction of works. Hence, little time remained to initiate O&M operations. The main reason for
this delay has been the problems of land acquisition, which delayed the construction phase. Presently,
there appears to be no O&M system in place, even though an O&M Manual was developed under the
Flood Action Plan in 1993. This manual stipulates BWDB's role as well as beneficiary participation
and is to be used as a guideline for maintenance of polder embankments and related structures. GOB
has recently prepared an O&M plan for project works. To ensure sustainability, GOB must ensure that
adequate funds are provided to carry out the plans and that staff are trained to implement new



iv
participatory O&M guidelines. Otherwise, the benefits to be derived from the project's investments
would be lost in a relatively short period.
8.         The SAR estimated total project cost at US$27.5 million, of which 16% was foreign
exchange, while at project completion actual total cost was US$21.5 million of which 5% has been
estimated to have been spent on foreign exchange cost. This permitted about US$6.0 million to be
reallocated to emergency rehabilitation works following the 1991 cyclone. (These works will be
covered on a separate ICR.) Favourable movement in the SDRtUS$ and US$/Taka exchange rates
during project implementation permitted disbursement of US$21.25 million as compared to US$20.0
million anticipated while an additional SDR 1.36 million of the IDA credit had to be cancelled.
9.         The project's economic impact has been better than anticipated. The ERR re-estimated at
completion (25%) is higher than the ERR of 18% estimated at appraisal. This is mainly due to higher
production and introduction of other higher-value crops.
10.        The Bank's performance during the project implementation phase has been satisfactory,
but several oversights occurred during appraisal. Firstly, the project appraisal was based on preliminary
designs and cost estimates which led to a number of alterations after the subsequent completion of
detailed designs (para 3).  As many as 210,000 people were to be protected from  floods.
Consideration should, therefore, have been given to fuse plugs allowing the polders to be filled in a
controlled manner in the event of floods exceeding the design levels. Secondly, whereas at appraisal it
was recognised that appropriate mitigating measures would need to be taken to minimise the possible
effects of floods on the adjacent unprotected areas due to the project interventions, no such proposals
were included under the project. Neither had appraisal listed any measures to minimise the project's
hindrance on the nigration of certain species of fish3 in the project area. The Bank supervision
missions, however, had been effective in guiding the project management and are to be credited for
their pointed observations and advice given during implementation.
11.        The Borrower's performance has been satisfactory during the construction phase, but
rather disappointing in pre-construction land acquisition. The poor performance in land acquisition has
been the principal obstacle to timely project implementation and led to a construction phase of eight
4
rather than four years.
12.        Despite the mixed performance of the Bank and of the Borrower, the overall outcome of
the project is rated as satisfactory. The embankments have been built, the farmers in the polders have
shown enthusiasm and are now cultivating high yielding and high value crops. However, the principal
key to a continued success would be project sustainability, i.e., introduction of an effective O&M
programme, and the Borrower's willingness to provide funds to implement this programme.
3 The Project Summary of the SAR interpreted this as meaning the risk of a potential decrease in production of
natural fisheries; no mention of this was made in the SAR.
4  Compared to FCD-III (eight years of construction), this could be interpreted as an improvement, but it should
be realized that the project area of FCD-III was significantly larger.



v
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
13.        Implementation delays in the processing of land acquisition was identified as a possible
risk at appraisal, but arrangements made to minimise the risk proved inadequate. This has been the
principal obstacle to smooth and timely project implementation. Also, finalization of project proposals
based on preliminary designs at appraisal led to a number of alterations after completion of detailed
designs during implementation. The most important findings with regard to avoiding implementation
delays are, therefore, that land acquisition compensations should be fair and based on market studies of
prevailing land values, land acquisition procedures should be streamlined and detailed designs should be
completed prior to appraisal.
14.        The BWDB's Operation Wing wil be responsible for O&M of the project infrastructure
and thus for the project sustainability. BWDB's intention is to involve polder beneficiaries in its O&M
planning and implementation. Some funds are available but these are largely used to cover the basic
running cost of BWDB's Operation Wing and little is left for actual O&M servicing. BWDB has
recently prepared O&M plans for project works involving beneficiary participation. To ensure
sustainability, GOB must ensure that adequate funds are provided to carryout the plan and that staff are
trained to implement new participatory O&M guidelines. An action plan has been agreed to improve
BWDB's O&M activities, and progress in implementing this plan is essential to sustainability of most
BWDB subprojects.
15.        The most important lessons from the project are similar to those from FCD-lI and
concern the need for better overall planning for land acquisition and preparation of detailed engineering
designs before project appraisal; addressing environmental issues (such as reduced floodplains fish
production or higher flood levels elsewhere) in advance of project appraisal; and the need to ensure
adequate O&M planning, availability of funds for implementation of the O&M operations, and
strengthening of O&M institutional capacity, without which post-project sustainability of projects
works would be in jeopardy. An additional lesson is that when two similar projects, such as FCD m
and FCD IV, are processed and implemented as almost parallel operations,5 a better alternative would
be to either be cost-effective and merge them under one operation or allow for sufficient time lag
between the two so as to benefit from the lessons of experience of the first project in planning and
implementing the second operation.
5 According to the SAR of FCD III, the preparation study for FCD IV was to be terminated by mid-1985, while
according to the PMU, both studies were completed at about the same time.

FOURTH FLOOD CONTROL AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(Cr. 1784-BD)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.        The Fourth Flood Control and Drainage Project (FCD IV) was similar in its objectives and
design to several on-going projects at the time, including three supported by IDA credits (Cr.864-BD for
FCD I, Cr. 1184-BD for FCD II and Cr. 1591-BD for FCD m). The main objectives of FCD IV were:
(a) to protect against crop losses, loss of life and property damage due to floods; (b) to enhance the
physical environment to allow farmers to apply improved agricultural practices; (c) to strengthen the
Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB); and (d) to promote increased food production. The
project was designed to cover an area of 63,100 ha under flood control and drainage (FCD). About
34,500 farm families or about 210,000 people were expected to benefit. The project included: (i) the
construction and rehabilitation of embankments, water control structures, drainage canals, and building
and upgrading of roads; (ii) institutional support to BWDB and the Ministry of Irrigation, Water
Development and Flood Control (MOI); and (iii) preparation of programs for further development of
crops, livestock and fisheries within the project area and three adjacent polders.
2.        The SAR was based on a feasibility report commissioned by BWDB and prepared by
international consultants (NEDECO). Final designs were completed by BWDB during implementation
with the help of technical assistance (local and international) under the project. Due to appraisal prior to
completion of final designs, some items originally included in the SAR were later dropped or modified
(see para 10).
3.        The project objectives were clear, realistic and important. Owing to the experience gained
from the previous FCD-lII, the SAR for FCD IV included several regulators-cum-inlet sluices to be
located at the out-fall of drainage channels to allow fish migration into permanently submerged areas. In
fact, such regulators-cum-inlet sluices have not been provided and no reason could be found for this
omission. Also, the question arises that when two similar projects such as FCD III and FCD IV were
almost concurrently processed and implemented, why the projects were not merged under one credit,
particularly since they were appraised based on the feasibility study reports prepared by the same
consulting firm (NEDECO) and were also executed by the same PMU in BWDB. Further, due to their
overlapping implementation schedules, no lessons could be learned from FCD III to be applied to



2
FCD IV, except the one mentioned above about the need to permit fish migration into submerged areasu'
while the parallel execution of both projects increased administration costs. It is also to note in this
context that both the projects also closed almost at the same time and the experience gained and lessons
learned from them are very similar.
4.        As a result, despite availability of necessary technical assistance in an attempt to ensure
smooth project implementation, BWDB faced under FCD IV the same obstacles that had been hindering
FCD-IITs implementation. These impediments included lack of counterpart funds mainly for land
acquisition and the bureaucratic hurdles that had to be taken to complete the land acquisition
arrangements, on which BWDB had no control.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.        Most of the project's physical and development objectives have been achieved, albeit with
significant delay causing concerns about O&M and sustainability of works (see para 17). The polder has
been established and its embankments are protecting the lives and properties of polder inhabitants.
Agricultural production has already increased without any further project intervention; most farmers
living in the project polder have been practising their agriculture largely without fear of floods, which has
spurred production of high-yielding and high value crops. Although some problems are still to be
overcome (see Appendix 1), it is clear that the project has already had a positive impact on the
agriculture development. Its full development impact can only be actually assessed in about two to three
years time.
6.        The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and the Net Present Value (NPV - opportunity cost
of capital 12%) of the project have been re-estimated and show a significantly better economic
performance than was anticipated at appraisal, i.e. 25% viz-a-viz 18% and Tk 609 million viz-z-viz
Tk 182 million. These calculations take into account anticipated losses in fish production due to the
project. The higher ERR and NPV are mainly due to the following: (i) a substantial amount of other
more profitable crops not foreseen at appraisal (vegetables, potatoes, tomatoes and spices) were
produced during the project implementation period; and (ii) the overall estimated production volume has
been higher than the one estimated in the SAR. So far, no other factor has favourably affected the ERR
and NPV. The economic investment cost and the economic prices in the ICR are largely similar to those
estimated in the SAR, while the actual project investment period was longer than anticipated in the SAR
and should have had an adverse rather than a favourable effect on the ERR (see Part I, Table 9 and
Appendix 2).
7.        Strengthening of BWDB under FCD-IV has been a continuing process previously financed
under FCD I and FCD II and also a parallel exercise funded under FCD-lI. Because of this, it is
difficult to segregate and assess FCD IV's contribution to the improvement of BWDB's organisation and
capabilities. There has been some improvement in implementation performance but serious weaknesses
remain.  Poor performance in maintenance and monitoring are still major concerns. During
A second lesson concemed the measures that were included under the project o resolve the adverse effect
of the project's embankments on adjacent polders, i.e. Polders A, B and C, for which the embankments
were not designed for a 20-year return period on a confined basis.



3
implementation, the Task Manager at the Bank's office in Dhaka and the PMU had a close relationship
with BWDB in terms of prioritising of development issues, and problems and problem solving.
8.        However, the recommendations of the study on BWDB's structure and organisation that
was undertaken under FCD mI, were to be carried out during FCD IV implementation. Little evidence
so far could be found that this has really been done.
9.        Despite the reasonably satisfactory achievement of the project in increasing agricultural
production and protecting the lives and properties of polder inhabitants, mention should be made of the
potentially adverse effects on the environment and the livelihood of the flood plain fishermen. Due to the
construction of the embankments, the free movement of several fish species to the spawning grounds has
been impeded and jeopardised the existence of these species. The flood plain fishermen who previously
could catch the produce easily from the wild are now sometimes faced with empty beels and need to
obtain permission for fishing other areas now created by the polders. An attempt is now being made to
compensate for the decrease in fish catch from the wild through promoting culture fisheries, but this
would neither fully help the flood plain fishermen nor help mitigate the environmental concerns about
diminution of fish species. In this situation, GOB should actively pursue and ensure that the
recommendations emanating from the project-supported Agricultural and Fishery Development Studies
(para 19) and any further follow-up recommendations to redress this issue that are available, are filly
implemented as part of post-project operations plan.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors Not Generally Subject to Government Control
10.       The project was appraised on the basis of preparatory work done by NEDECO consultants
with preliminary engineering design. This resulted, during implementation, in a considerable number of
alterations and omissions of components, of which the major ones include: (i) reduced drainage canals
from 465 km to about 262 km; (ii) decreased number of irrigation inlets from 50 to 32"2; (iii) reduced
number of water control structures from 27 to 17; and (iv) increased length of road infrastructure from
67 to 127 knm, of which 12 km were new roads, and the remainder rehabilitated.
11.       Project appraisal did not evaluate effects on fish migration. Indications are that about 1,750
tons of foodplain fish production, with an estimated worth of US$1.3 million per year, have been lost
due to the project 3'. There are expected to be compensating gains in cultural fisheries due to the
improved flood protection provided by the project, and this process has already started. However, this
does not mitigate the loss of income to landless floodplains fishing families. The approach to this issue
used in the SAR of requesting the project designs to include mitigating proposals (which in fact was not
done) appears in retrospect to have been inadequate4'

4A study to this effect was only finalized in April 1994, but so far no follow-up action has been taken.



4
Factors Subject to Government Control
12.       Land acquisition for construction of the embankments and drainage channels was
cumbersome after the land acquired for the first year of construction was used up. This was due to the
fact that land acquisition prices offered by the project were based on land values reported to the tax
authorities rather than on market studies of prevailing land values. The land acquisition prices offered
were, therefore, much too low and often disputed. In addition local political and ministerial obstruction
also contributed to land acquisition delays. As a consequence, completion of construction was delayed
by three years (it took eight years instead of five years estimated at appraisal) and O&M for the last two
years of the project could not be practised as foreseen. The lack of O&M on civil works is clearly visible
and sustainability is already in doubt (para 17).
13.       Flood protection provided by the project concerns about 210,000 persons who would be at
risk of inundation if the one-in-20 years design flood level is exceeded. In such an event, the breach of
embankment would be unpredictable and occur with a tremendous force. GOB should, therefore, install
flood warning systems and fuse plugs designed to flood the polder in a controlled manner.
14.       The SAR based investment on a one in 20-year flood protection for the project area. As the
embankment along the Baranai river is built about one meter below the project embankment crest,
higher floods should be expected in these northem polders in future, due to flood water displacement,
than in the without project situation. Consideration should be given to the costs and benefits of raising
the height of these low embankments to the required crest levels. However, this would be a substantial
undertaking. In the future, such effects of projects on flood levels elsewhere should be thoroughly
reviewed during project preparation.
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
15.       Day-to-day management by the PMU of BWDB was satisfactory considering the large
number of small contractors dispersed over the project area who had to be co-ordinated and supervised.
Nevertheless, based on the mission's observations during field visits some specific aspects need BWDB's
attention. These are: (i) due to land acquisition problems, embankment slopes are occasionally below
specification requirements which diminishes their stability; (ii) in-and-outflow sections of regulators are
not protected by hand rails and represent a danger to the public; (iii) an additional irrigation inlet was
installed after the construction of the embankment was completed, using an inferior structural design
with wooden portable gates and thus creating a weak point in the embankment, reducing the flood
protection safety; and (iv) at Tahirpur, a local government (LG) road crosses the embankment, about
one meter below crest level giving room for spillage in case of floods.
Source: PMU. The SAR indicates a crest height to protect the Chalan Beel Polder for a return period of
100 years and for the Chalan Beel Polder A, B and C for a return period of 20 years.

16.       The studies on Agriculture and Fisheries Development in the completed polder were done in
great depth and can be considered as being satisfactory, except for their late completion which precluded
taking action on the studies recommendations during the implementation period.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17.       Project sustainability depends upon BWDB's Operational Wmg maintaining the civil works.
Past experience in this regard with the existing 40 polders throughout the country (including those
implemented under FCD HI) is not encouraging and present O&M funds do not cover much more than
the regular running cost (salaries and the like). Beneficiary participation in maintenance does not yet
exist and embankment cuts by the public occur occasionally (for various motives including flood release
by outsiders,6 drainage by insiders and irrigation). These problems were foreseen at appraisal and
provisions were made to finance O&M for two years after project construction. However, due to late
completion of civil works, actual O&M operations have started only recently and that too on an ad hoc
basis since a proper maintenance plan was not yet established. First deteriorations are visible on
structures and embankments, the latter being eroded by human action and the environment. Brick roads
are also undulating and eroding due to heavy traffic and bricks are being pilfered. Unless the
beneficiaries are involved in maintenance of at least the embankments and the drainage channels (as is
customary in other countries, for example) through Beneficiary Associations, sustainability is uncertain.
BWDB has recently prepared an O&M plan for project works. To ensure sustainability, GOB must
ensure that adequate funds are provided to carry out the plan and staff are trained to implement new
participatory O&M guidelines. An action plan has been agreed to strengthen BWDB's O&M activities
(see para 28) and IDA intends to closely monitor performance.
E. IDA PERFORMANCE
18.       IDA's performance during the project implementation phase has been satisfactory, but
several shortcomings occurred during appraisal. The project was appraised based on prelininary designs
and cost estimates which resulted in a number of alterations during detailed designs (para 10). As about
210,000 people were to be protected from floods, consideration should have been given to a fuse plugs
design to fill the polder in a controlled manner during floods in excess of the design levels.
19.       The SAR foresaw the possible environmental impact the polders would create on the fish
population and proposed to introduce measures in project design to minimise any negative impact on
natural fisheries. No such measures were specifically listed in the SAR and none were implemented.
Also, the Agricultural and Fishery Development Studies financed by the project with EC grant funding
were completed only in April 1994 and therefore no measures could be taken prior to project completion
to mitigate the above environmental concern. It is reported that the Department of Fisheries is now
implementing some development programs in the project area based on the recommendations of these
studies.
6 As adjacent polders flood first, cutting the project's embankments appear to be releasing the adjacent
polders' flood waters (the effect of a single cut will however be minimal).

20.       IDA placed a Task Manager in its Resident Mission in Dhaka which alowed close and
continuous superision and frequent contact with the PMU. Ten supervision missions were fielded and
the identified problems were clearly spelled out. Particularly the land acquisition problem was
highlighted by all missions. Reporting was done in great detail and can be rated as highly satisfactorily.
21.       Although IDA was not responsible for technical assistance and training, it should be
mentioned that these components were successfully completed, although with some delay. The EU is
undertaking an evaluation of this component (for which it was mainly responsible), together with an
overall evaluation of the project, and a report is expected by mid-1996.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.       The Borrower's perfom ance has been satisfactory during the construction phase, but rather
disappointing in pre-construction land acquisition. An area of concem is also the O&M of completed
works. Detailed designs of civil works have been done very satisfactorily by the Borrower with the help
of its consultants, except for the failure in incorporate measures to reduce damage to fisheries. The
PMU established under the FCD III continued to operate competently under this project and BWDB
used its field offices effectively for the execution of civil works. While progress in institutional
development is difficult to quantify, the weaknesses in BWDB's implementation monitoring and
maintenance perfomiance remain as serious issues.
23.       Polder regulators are operated either by farmers' representatives or by BWDB staff on the
instructions of farmers' committees. BWDB staff participates in the committee meetings and advises as
necessary. Maintenance of structures is intended to be carried out by BWDB even though so far this has
hardly been done. Similarly, no routine maintenance has been carried out of the embankment and of the
embankment roads. After the first year of the project, the implementation of the O&M component fell
behind due to the continuous lag in land acquisition, which delayed construction and thus maintenance
operations. Presently there is no O&M system in place, even though an O&M Manual was developed
under the Flood Action Plan in 1993. This manual requires a strong BWDB role as well as beneficiary
participation and is to be used as a guideline for the maintenance of the polder embankments and related
structures. An O&M plan has recently been prepared.
24.       All three studies which were to be prepared under the project (Part II - Table 7) have been
completed satisfactorily. On the basis of the Agricultural and Fisheries Development Program, a joint
plan of action was prepared by BWDB, the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), and the
Department of Fisheries (DOF) but due to some errors required revisions, which was completed by
December 1995. In addition, the project financed the preparation of a Project Completion Report (PCR)
which was issued in June 1994 - prior to project closure. Some statistical data of the report were used in
the present ICR. However, the PCR was weak on analysis work, discussed excessively a Ganges
barrage (not a subject of the project), presented as a main lesson the proposal to rehabilitate the project
after five years and finally was considered unsatisfactory and not accepted by BWDB.
25.       BWDB is now implementing the recommendations that have been made by the BWDB's
Institutional Capability Study financed under FCD Im which made specific suggestions to strengthen its



7
planning, construction, operation and maintenance capacities and which were to be followed up by this
project, FCD IV. So far, funding for the new functions of BWDB do not appear to be a problem.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
26.       The project has achieved most of its major objectives as set out in the SAR and its overall
outcome could therefore be rated as satisfactory. However, for reasons of serious delays in
implementation of the construction programme, O&M operations could not be started as planned
thereby causing concerns about the project's sustainability and this aspect needs GOB's urgent attention
(see para 17).
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
27.       BWDB's Operation Wing will be responsible for O&M of the project. While overall
BWDB expenditure on maintenance doubled between FY89 and FY94, expenditure levels are still
inadequate. Full participation of beneficiaries in maintenance of the embankments and the brick roads
(as practised in other countries) appears essential to render the project investments sustainable in the
long-term.  While O&M  plans involving beneficiary participation have recently been prepared,
sustainability will require that priority be given to their effective implementation, including provision of
adequate funds and staff training in implementing participatory O&M methods.
28.       An action plan has been agreed to improve BWDB's O&M  activities through:
(i) separating staff and responsibilities for O&M and construction, to focus a portion of the staff on
O&M; and (ii) increasing the staffing of the Division responsible for assisting the organisation of
beneficiary participation. Continued close monitoring by the Bank's Resident Mission in Bangladesh is
planned, in conjunction with the ongoing BWDB Systems Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2099-BD), to
ensure O&M is given appropriate priority. Future sector work and water sector lending is also intended
to place heavy emphasis on issues of O&M and beneficiary participation.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
29.       Key lessons learned under this project are similar to those learned from the experience of
FCD mII. These are:
(i)   land acquisition compensations should be fair and based on market studies of
prevailing land values and the land acquisition system itself ought to be carefully
planned and the bureaucratic process should be initiated before project appraisal or
negotiations;
(ii)   detailed designs of key works should be undertaken before appraisal;
(iii)   FCD  projects need to be carefully planned takdng due note of possible
environmental consequences (such as reduced fish production and higher flood



8
water elsewhere) and be designed to include specific measures to mitigate them;
and
(iv)   preparation of an appropriate O&M plan, adequate funding for its implementation
and strengthening BWDB's O&M institutional capacity are essential to ensure
sustainability of water-sector investments. (The recent preparation of O&M plans
for the project, involving beneficiary participation and an action plan for improving
BWDB's O&M activities are positive developments, but vigilance is needed to
ensure that these plans are effectively implemented.)
30.       An additional lesson is that when two similar projects, such as FCD mII and FCD IV, are
processed and implemented almost parallel, a better altemative would be to either be cost-effective and
merge them under one operation or allow for sufficient time lag between the two so as to benefit from
7
the lessons of experience of the first project in planning and implementing the second operation.
7 According to the SAR of FCD III, the study of FCD IV was to be terminated by mid- 1985, while
according to the PMU, both projects were completed at the same time.

2/  Appraisal was based on insufficient design details and ignored the possible adverse environmental
implications of the polders, however the latter can be stated now only with the benefit of hindsight.
3/  This satisfactory rating is based upon the recent progress in developing a suitable O&M plan, and
assumes that this plan is adequately funded and implemented. While overall BWDB expenditures
on maintenance doubled between FY89 and FY94, expenditure levels are still inadequate. Various
actions have been agreed (para 28) to improve BWDB's O&M activities. Continued close
monitoring by the Resident Mission is planned to ensure that O&M is given appropriate priority.
Future sector work and water sector lending are also intended to place heavy emphasis on the issues
of O&M and beneficiary participation.

Date of final disbursement
End FY92 SDR 4.36 million had been reallocated to a Section ofthe DCA that was added in April 1992 and dealt with rehabilitation of coastal
embankments and related structures damaged during the cyclone of April 1991. SDR 4.25 million was disbursed for these purposes. Converted into
USS, this meant that about US$6.0 million of the US$21.250 million was not spent on the original project (the work on rehabilitation of coastal
embankments, financed by this credit, three other credits, and Japanese and European Community grants, will be covered in a separate ICR). In this
context it should be noted that the SDR 4.36 is included in the disbursement schedule but not in the actual project cost nor in the actual project funancing
tables (Tables 8A and 8B).
'MThe percentiles after 1990 are rather misleading since the SDR value vis-a-vis US$ increased. Due to the increase in the value of the SDR,
inspite of disbursing 106% in USS ofthe SAR estimate, SDR 1.36 million was cancelled at credit closing.

AIDE-MEMOIRE (MARCH 30,1995)
Appendix 1
Introduction
1.        The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) Mission" from the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP), comprising Messrs. D.J. Lens (Project Analyst, Mission
Leader) and V. Branscheid (Land and Water Development Engineer), visited Bangladesh from
March 14 to 30, 1995 ' to: (i) assess the project implementation and operation performance,
including the operational plan if prepared; (ii) solicit the Borrower's views in the same; and
(iii) advise and support the Borrower in the preparation of its own contribution to the ICR.
2.        Upon its arrival in Dhaka the mission held meetings with officials from the Project
Management Unit (PMU) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the World
Bank Project Task Manager and the FAO. Country Representative. Subsequently, it undertook
field visits to the project area where it met and discussed project implementation with BWDB
field staff and representatives of the agricultural extension services, and held interviews with
prqject farmers.
3.        The Aide-Memoire reflects the findings of the mission which was reviewed and
agreed upon first with the Project Task Manager and the PMU, and subsequently with all
institutions involved in the project at a wrap-up meeting held on March 30, 1995 and chaired by
the Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources. The Aide-Memoire covers: (i) the project's
implementation performance and reasons for its drawbacks; (ii) the status of the Operation and
Maintenance (O&W Plan; and (iii) the necessary actions to be taken to maintain the project's
established infrastructure and to complete the Government's contribution to the ICR.
4.        The mission wishes to thank the staff of PMU, BWDB and the Ministry of Water
Resources for the assistance, cooperation and courtesy they extended to the mission and would
like to express its appreciation for the frankness with which they discussed and reviewed the
implementation issues.
In Dhaka, the mision recnrited the services of Dr. Tajul Islam (Agronomist) under separate Terms of
Reference through the FAO Representative's office to undertake a rapid ass_ment of the agricultural situation
in the project area.
V'  During the period, the ICR misson also covered FCD-M for which a separte Aide-Memoire has been
preaed.

BANGLADESH: Fourth Flood Control and Drainage Project
(Cr.17S4-BD)
Appendix 1: Aide Memoim.
Objectives, Area, Components and Cost of FCD-IV
5.         The principle objectives of the project were to: (i) protect crops, human life and
property against floods; (ii) enhance agricultural potential; and (iii) strengthen BWDB. The
project comprised 63,100 ha" of flood protection and drainage in the Rajshahi and Natore
Districts in the North-Westem Region of the country. Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) components
included: land acquisition (15% of project cost); civil works (60%); technical assistance and
studies' (4%); operaltion and maintenance (O&M - 3%); and others (18% -covering equipment,
surveys and investigations, and engineering and administration). Total project cost was estimated
at US$27.5 million of which 17% was foreign exchange. The project was to be funded over a
seven-year period by IDA (73% of project cost), the Government of Bangladesh (GOB - 23%),
and the European Commission (EC - 4%). The latter was to finance the technical assistance and
the studies component.
Implementation of FCD-IV
Land Acquisition
6.         Despite the. more stringent arrangements than those incorporated into the project
design of FCD-EII to minimize the risk of delays in land acquisition, slow land acquisition
became again a problem after the first year of project implementation. The first year itself went
relatively smooth due to the conditions of negotiation.' Also the relatively tight implementation
schedule in FCD-l had been more relaxed to accommodate a better implementation of the land
acquisition component than had been the case in FCD-II. Apparently, this was to no avail since
land acquisition followed a similar pattern as in FCD-m except in the first year, and also here
became a continuous drag on project execution. Like in FCD-L, GOB assurances that the
continuously reset land acquisition target would be met were futile and may have established a
credibility problem  with the Bank.  Due to this, and lack of initial counterpart funds
implementation was delayed and the project had to be scaled down in 1992 and extended for one
more year. The scaling down and a change in the SDR/Tk exchange rate enabled the project to
save about SDR 4.6 million (US$ 6 million) of the Credit.' By mid-1993, 100% of the revised
"   Net command or agricultwual area - 48,300 ha.
4' Including the rehabilitation studies for Poldms A, B & C.
5' wSubmion to the Deputy Commissioner of land acquisition plans by BWDB for the first year construction

' Those savings were reallocated through an amndment of the DCA for a program to filize the rehabilitation
of cyclone-damaged cotl embankt and afforestation of the foreshore areas which was supervised
separately, and as such, not covered by the present ICR mission.

target area had been acquired, while according to the SAR implementation schedule, all land
acquisition was to be completed by mid-1990.7' The overrun of about three years is still
excessive, taking into account that the land acquired was only about 25% of that in FCD-M.
Hence an unsatisfactory rating would not appear incorrect for the implementation of the land
acquisition component. It would therefore appear that the study on an improved land acquisition
system, which was carried out before this project was initiated, has not been effective.
Civil Works
7.         A total of 64 km of drainage canals re-excavation was not completed by the extended
project closure date of December 31, 1994 which reduced the total work on drainage channels
to only 193 km, which is equal to only 42% of the SAR target of 465 km. So far, it is not clear
what effect this reduction will have on the overall agricultural performance of the project, but this
is expected to be indicated by the ongoing EC-financed evaluation study when completed.
8.         The assessment of civil works was based on field visits to the Baranai polder and the
implementation can generally be considered as satisfactory' based on the following observations:
(i) embankment slopes are occasionally below requirements due to land acquisition problems
which diminishes their stability; (ii) in-and-outflow sections of regulators are not protected by
hand rails and represent a permanent danger to the public; (iii) one additional irrigation inlet was
installed after the construction of the embankment was completed, using a less expensive and
inferior structural design with wooden portable gates and thus establishing a weak point in the
embankment, which diminishes the flood protection security; and (iv) a local government (LG)
road crosses the embankment at Tahirpur about one meter below crest level inviting spillage in
case of floods.
9.         Finally, the mission is also concerned about flood hazards when the design flood of
"once in a 20 years period" will occur. In such a case, the breaching of embankrnents would be
at unpredictable locations (except for the LG road crossing) and probably with a destructive force.
Hence, flood warning systems should be installed and spill ways designed to allow the flood to
enter the polder in a more controlled manner.
71 Required land was reduced from 325 ha in the Project Proforma to 315.96 ha after detailed design (the SAR
indicates an area of 560 ha).
v  Unlike for FCD-M, the ICR mission did not possess a detailed survey at the final part of project
implementation and had to limit its implementation assessment on visual observation, supervision reports and
data provided by the PMU.

Appendix 1: Aide Memoire
Technical Assistance and Studies
10.       The technical assistance has been successfully completed, although with some delay.
The EC is now conducting an evaluation of this component (for which it was mainly responsible)
in the overall context of the project. The studies on benchmark survey, monitoring and
evaluation, and on agriculture and fisheries development were also undertaken by the EC and
completed satisfactorily. Another study that was to be carried out by IDA, i.e. the assessment
of hydrological studies of the Chalan Beel polder A, B, C and D" and the rehabilitation plan
for these polders, were completed satisfactorily.
Operation and Maintenance
11.       The operation of polder regulators is either done by farmers' representatives or by
BWDB staff on the instructions of farmers' committees. BWDB staff participates on the
committees' meeting and advises as necessary. Maintenance of the structures to be carried out
by BWDB is barely done as evidenced by rusting gates and missing screws on gate lifting
devices, which can be moved fIeely and might fail in an emergency. Similarly, no embankment
routine maintenance is carried out which is clearly visible by the status of the embankment roads;
tracks have now been fonned on these roads due to heavy traffic while bricks missing in several
places have not been replaced. If the no-maintenance situation is allowed to continue, the polder
would eventually become a flood plain again and the investment would have been in vain.
12.       Funding appears to be the principal obstacle to O&M  and hence to project
sustainability. Although GOB realizes that lack of maintenance is likely to endanger the entire
investment and is generally less expensive than periodic rehabilitation, it has been unable to take
appropriate action.
13.       The global operation plan developed under the System Rehabilitation Project was
submitted to the World Bank in December 1994 and is now being adapted specifically for FCD-
IV. So far, no O&M plan has been submitted to the ICR mission and it was agreed that it would
be sent to the Bank together with the Government's contribution to the ICR.
Government Contribution to the ICR
14.       The Govemment's contribution to the ICR is still in preparation and could not be
provided to the ICR mission, although all data required were made readily available to the
mission. The ICR mission explained that its draft report will be submitted to the Government

for review and that the Government's contribution to the ICR should then be completed and sent
to the Bank together with their comments on the draft ICR. It was agreed that the World Bank
Operational Manual guideline for ICR preparation be followed for the preparation of the
Government's contribution to the ICR.
Conclusions
15.       The overal assessment of project implementation, although scaled down, can be rated
as satisfactory on the basis of the data made available to the ICR mission and its own visual
observations. The works were relatively weUl done and the farmers were enthused about the
enhanced agricultural development opportunities created through the project. Nevertheless, the
mission would like to point out that O&M funding would need to be increased to an appropriate
level to ensure the sustainability of the project. In this respect, it should be noted that the
improvement of defects such as the recently installed inferior irrigation inlet structure is part of
the maintenance work. Although BWDB was previously already made aware that such structures
and situations could endanger the polder, no concrete actions have been taken.
16.       So far, the principal and most important dissonant on FCD-IV concerns the project's
possible adverse effect on flood land fisheries in the project area. An attempt to neutralize this
is now being made by a fish culture program in the polders' ponds. This may indeed countervail
eventuaUy the possible reduction in flood land fish catch, but would not compensate the inland
fishermen"w who already belong to the socially lowest population stratum in Bangladesh. The
introduction of fish culture would neither remove the environmental concerns that have been
expressed in respect of the fish species disappearance, claimed to be possibly due to the water
flow obstruction caused by the embankments. This matter should be looked into in depth as soon
as possible to avoid a continuous debate on the subject and thereby delaying any further
development action in these areas. If the claimed allegation would be true, other "polder"
concepts would need to be studied and introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of the
embankments on the flood land fisheries stocks.
17.       In brief, the project implementation performance and most probably also its outcome
can be rated as satisfactory, although not necessarily on a sustained basis. The latter wil be
achieved only once the O&M system is introduced, properly funded and hence has become
effective.
'( The ICR mission observed many fishennen during its visits and despite the allegation made on the adverse
effect that the project would have on the flood land fishermen.

Appendix 2
Asmptions
1.        Project Life: Twenty five years, with full development reached in project year 13
(FY2000).
2.        Prices: Farmgate prices for traded goods are all expressed at international 1994
prices (World Bank Commodity Outlook), while non-traded goods are based on financial prices
and are assumed not to change in real terms. Domestic prices are translated into border prices
using a standard conversion rate (SCR) of 0.9.
3.        Project Benefits: The project benefits observed (so far one year since the project
embankments have been completed in FY94) are not conclusive in quantitative terms, but would
result from an expected reduction of crop losses, and changing risk perception of farmers leading
to higher value cropping pattern, yield increases, and an increase in cropping intensity due to
a diminished flood risk brought about by the project. No benefits are assumed before the
embankments have been completed, which is the reason for the empty spaces in Table 1 for the
production in the with-and-without-project situation until the time that the embankments are
completed (the with-and-without-project situation is considered the same during that period).
4.        The expected annual losses in flood plain fish production (Tk 50 million)," due to
the project, have been taken into account. However, these losses would be compensated over
a five-year period after completion of the embanxkments due to the effect of the project's
increased flood protection in increasing fish production through fish culture, which is now being
practised by an increasing number of farmers in the polder. These benefits from culture
fisheries are evaluated net of costs. (However, inspite of the balancing effect on fish production
due to cultural fisheries expansion, there remains a negative distribution effect from landless
fisher-families to owners of fish ponds or tanks.)

5.        The estimated with-project benefits, based only on one year monitoring, have been
lowee than the with-project benefits estimated in the SAR, but are expected to increase at their
full development level within three years at the same rate as estimated in the SAR, i.e. 21%.
The without-project benefits have been estimated on the basis of the yields (which are relatively
higher than those estimated in the SAR) and cropping pattern in the adjacent areas to the polder
and have been assumed to remain stable. It should also be noted that the economic analysis does
not take account of the increased flooding in other areas over the without project situation. Data
is not available to analyze such effects.
6.        As in the SAR, the project benefits do not include an assessment of the potential
impact of floods with a recurrent period of over 20 years on the project area in the without-
project situation, because the statistical basis is too poor to estimate any potential damages.
It should also be noted that the economic analysis does not take account of the increased flooding
in other areas over the without-project situation. Data is not available to analyse such effects.
7.        Project Cost: The project costs, including O&M until completion of embankments -
and excluding land acquisition, expressed in current Takas have been converted into constant
1994 Takas by applying the Bangladeshi annual consumer index of the International Financial
Statistics (IMF monthly bulletin); the foreign cost component has been relatively small. The
costs were then adjusted by the SCF in border prices and form the basis for estimating the ERR.
The O&M costs, which have been separately calculated after completion of the embankments
and assumed to be equal to the requirements projected by the BWDB, have also been adjusted
by the SCF and tacen into account in the estimation of the ERR.
The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV)
8.        The ERR and the NPV of the project have been estimated on the above basis and
are respectively about 25% (SAR 18%) and Tk 609 million (opportunity cost of capital is 12% -
SAR Tk 182 million)."'
9.        The project has done better in economic terms than expected despite its delay in
implementation due to land acquisition problems. The main reason for this is the estimated
larger incremental benefit line (in comparison with the SAR) in the ICR, since in the SAR

estimated economic investment cost which was adjusted to constant 1994 Tk prices, is about
equal to the actual investment cost in the ICR. The reasons for the higher benefit line is due
mainly to the fact that other more profitable crops not foreseen at appraisal (vegetables, potatoes,
tomatoes and spices) were introduced in the meantime and the fact that the overall estimated
production volume has been higher than estimated in the SAR. Table 3 of this Appendix
indicates the first year figures only. At full development, in three years time, the overall
production is assumed to increase by 21% (see para 5 of this Appendix).
