MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEI REIN,ORCEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), with the
guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand, for US$50.0 million equivalent to help
finance a Distribution System Reinfircement Project. The proposed loan would be
for 17 years including four years of grace at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate.
2.        Background.   Thailand has been experiencing an economic boom since
1987. Between 1987 and 1990, Thailand's GDP growth. was among the highest in the
world, averaging over 11% p.a.  Since 1990, growth has been at about 8% p.a.,
which rate is expected to continue tnrough 1996. The rapid economic growth has
resulted in a concomitant growth in electricity demand, averaging 15% p.a. in the
past three years. Demand for electricity is forecast to grow at a rate of almost
10% p.a. over 1994-9Y.
3.        Industrial development in Thailand has in the past been centered in the
Langkok metropolitan  area.    Recognizing  the  infrastructural  limitations  of
Bangkok to support industrial growth indefinitely, the Government has established
a policy to balance growth in the urban and non-urban areas. It has designated
tax benefits for industrial and commercial developments outside Bangkok. Due in
part to the Government's efforts to stimulate industrial expansion outside of
Bangkok, a substantial amount of the expected increase in electricity demand
through the 1990s will fall within the territory of PEA, which is a government
corporation exclusively dedicated to electricity distribution systems outside of
Bangkok.   PEA sales are expected to go up by about 10% p.a. over the period.
Faced with the task of meeting this demand growth, PEA has proposed an investment
of about US$2 billion for the 1993-97 period. This program has the objectives of
reinforcing the provincial subtransmission/dIstribution system to improve its
efficiency, maintain losses at optimum levels, and enhance reliability. It also
will substantially complete the rural electrificacion (RE) program in the country
so that by the end of the period virtually all villages in Thailand will have
access to electricity.
4.        With regard to ownership of public enterprises,  the Government has
recently short-listed 15 state enterprise public utilities to consider for
privatization; the three power utilities are included among these 15 enterprises.
The Government had asked for Bank assistance in the development of a
privatization framework and an implementation program. The Bank study completed
in June 1994 focused largely on macro-level issues related to privatization,
leaving detailed planning for each enterprise to subsequent studies.   For the
power sector specifically, the Government has developed tentative plans for
deregulation, restructuring and privatization. The initial step in this process
tvould be to involve the private sector in EGAT activities and to corporatize the
distribution authorities, MEA and PEA; with the intention of eventually dividing
PEA into four or more regional companies.   PEA proposes to secure consultexcy



assistance to advise on the approach to corpcratization and regionalization of
PEA and in the context of this project, the Bank has been actively involved in
formulating terms of reference for the study, selecting consultar,ts, and will be
reviewing consultants' reports.
5.        While  pursuing  a  large  power  development  program,  including  a
comprehensive RE program, the Government has been: (a) planning a strong thrust
towards   energy   conservation;   and   (b)  placing   increased  emphasis   on
environmentally sound and sustainable development of the sector   The recently
enacted Energy Conservation Promotion Act creates an Energy Conservation Fund,
financed by surcharges on petroleum products.   The Act provides for rigorous
enforcement of energy conservation in factories and buildings.
6.        In 1992,  the Government approved the Demand-Side Management  (DSM)
Master Plan, setting a national target for saving about 300 MW over the period
1993-1997.   This plan is being supported by GEF funding under the Bank's
Distribution System and Energy Efficiency Project.   Over the duration of the
project PEA would be actively engaged in DSM in the provincial areas, and the
Bank would assist PEA in formulating and implementing specific DSM programs.
7.        Lessons Learned from Past Projects.  During past Bank projects, PEA has
improved its implementation capability by using consultants to assist in project
preparation and design of 115kV subtransmission systems. The main lesson learned
from the last project relevant to this operation is the need for more streamlined
procedures to deal with land acquisition, ICB procurement, and to improve the
quality of reporting of implementation. In this respect consultants will still
be needed to assist PEA to finalize bid documentation, improve bid evaluation
procedures and introduce computerized project management systems.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The rapid growth of the Thai economy
during the last decade has raised concerns about the quality and adequacy of
physical infrastructure, including facilities for the generation and distribution
of  electric  power.      Without  substantial  investments  and  complementary
institutional reforms, power shortages may become a significant constraint to
medium-term growth.  Hence the Bank's country Assistance Strategy for Thailand
(Report No. 13458-TH, which is being presented to the Board on September 22),
considers this area among the priorities for Bank. lending and policy advice.
Through its past involvement in the power sector, the Bank has assisted the three
electric utilities in Thailand in implementing least-cost investment programs and
in strengthening their capacity to undertake environmental assessments and local
consultation.  This project--the fifth with PEA--would improve the efficiency of
power distribution thereby complementing the efforts already underway, with Bank
assistance,  for demand-side efficiency improvements.   Moreover,  since PEA's
distribution system is located entirely outside the Bangkok Metropolitan Region
(BMR), the proposed Project would also help in reducing regional income
disparities, which has also been identified as an important priority for Bank
support in the CAS.
9.        The Project is consistent with the CAS and the Bank's policy paper for
the power sector in supporting the government's commitment to improve sector
performance through commercialization and corporatization and to encourage
private investment. The government however has yet to address the need for a
legal framework and regulatory process which will eventually be required. At
present, since PEA, MEA and EGAT are government corporations, the regulatory
fuiction handled by NEPO has performed satisfactorily in maintaining viable



-3-
tariffs and high efficiency of the respective organizations.   Looking to the
future, the government has requested the Bank's advice in reviewing the legal and
regulatory requirements for privat.zation of these and twelve other state
enterprises. In this context it can be expected to consider a number of options
for the power sector, once its future structure is determined. With regard to
PEA, the project will address the issues of commercialization and privatization
by designing an implementation program for decentralization of its regional
operations within the next two years. At the same time the expansion of 115kV
subtransmission into the regions should reduce the number of interfaces with
EGAT, eventually providing contiguous areas of operations for PEA's regional
companies,   giving  them  greater  flexibility  to  optimize  investment  in
distribution.    This  development  is expected to eventually provide a more
attractive basis for private investors to participate in offering a variety of
services, including direct sales of power to each of the regional companies.
10.       Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to expand the provincial 115kV subtransmission system to reinforce the 22kV
distribution system to meet the growth in power demand in the provincial areas at
optimum levels of losses and reliability; (b) to complete PEA's RE program by
extending eristing 22kV feeder networks to 1000 un-electrified and 10,000
partially electrified villages; (c) to assist PEA in studying and planning
corporatization and possible regionalization and privatization; and (d) to ensure
through the monitoring of appropriate financial covenants that PEt's financial
strength remains adequate to support its growth. Additionel objectives include
supporting PEA's efforts at Demand-Side Management (DSM) within the framework of
the national DSM plan.
11.       Project Description.  The project would involve:  (a) cornstruction of
about 19 115/22kV substations aggregating about 800 MVA in capacity and about 19
115kV transmission lines with a total length of about 920 km; (b) construction of
5500 km of 22kV lines, 84 MVA of distribution transformers, 8000 km of LV lines
and connections to 120,000 consumers in unelectrified and partially electrified
villages; (c) consulting services regarding corporatization and potential
regionalization and privatization of PEA; and (d) consulting services for
engineering and design of the subtransmission system.   The Bank loan would
finance the transmission line and the rural electrification components of the
project, and engineering consulting services.  During the course of the prne_ct,
PEA would formulate and implement pilot DSM programs in the provincial areas for
improving the efficienay of lighting systems, refrigerators, a:r conditioners and
agricultural pumping financed under Loan 3598-TH.  A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown ir Schedule B.   A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Thailand are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12235-TH dated August 18, 1994, is being
distributed separately.
12.       Project Implementation.  The feasibility study and basic design of the
project have been carried out by consultants under a grant from the US
government.   PEA will be the implementing agency for the project.   It hae
adequate capability for undertaking this major system expansion; it will avail of
consulting services for detailed engineering and design.
13.       Project Sustainability.  The technologies for lines and substations are
well proven and PEA is a technically competent utility which will operate and
maintain the project in a satisfactory manner; the project's physical
sustainability is thus assured.  The project is demonstrated to be least-cost



- 4 -
compared to alternative expansion proposals chich have considered distribution
expansion at 22kV with fewer substations. The projections for demand growth are
realistic,  and  the  project  is economically  sustainable.    PEA's  financial
performanc - is sound, and Government's policies for the sector are conducive to
financial  sustainability.    Even  though  the  financial  IRR  for  the  rural
electrification component is negative, satisfactory arrangements are in place to
assure its financing.
14.       Poverty Alleviation.   Overall Thailand's RE program has resulted in
significant benefits to the population at large, and has been a cornerstone of
the government's poverty alleviation program.   Between 1962 and 1988 poverty
incidence has declined from 57% of the population to 21.8%.   Real per capita
incomes increased more than threefold over this 26-year period, during which time
Thailand was transformed from a predominantly agrarian to industrial production
base. There is concern, however, over the sharp regional differences in average
income and poverty incidence, an issue which the project addresses in completing
the RE program.   The poor are overwhelmingly concentrated in rural districts
where there are pockets of poverty with few opportunities for employment. The
provision of electricity to these locations will provide an important component
of the basic infrastructure needed to accelerate productivity growth and provide
comparable employment opportunities to all sectors of the rural population.
15.       Agreed Actions.   Agreement was reached in the following main areas:
(a) annual review of PEA's investment program; (b) compliance with the Bank's
environmental guidelines; and (c) financial covenants for PEA, including the
requirement that it achieve a 25% self-financing ratio and maintain a debt/equity
ratio not exceeding 60/40.
16.       Environmental Implications.  The project is not expected to have any
substantial adverse impact on the environment and has been given a 'B'
classification. The concept of using 115kV subtransmission lines in place of a
host of lower voltage lines would reduce congestion in the line routes for 22kV
systems.   The subtransmission routings have been finalized, being parallel to
existing  roads  in open  areas.    The  lines  are not  expected  to  traverse
e_ologically sensitive areas such as primary forests nor are they expected to
involve resettlement of persons.   PEA carried out an Initial Environmental
Examination (IEE) of the lines according to the Bank guidelines, and submitted
their report to the Bank in mid-1993.  The substations will be located on the
outskirts of provincial towns, on plots of land purchased from the owners. No
resettlement of persons is envisaged and no problems are expected in routing the
lines in and out of the substations.
17.       Benefits and Risks.  The continuinE surge in electricity demand in the
PEA service territory has made it imperative for PEA to expand and upgrade its
system to deliver power to new areas and keep the losses and reliability of the
power distribution system at acceptable levels during the early 1990s.   The
project forms an important part of PEA's least-cost expansion program.   Its
implementation would help ensure the country's continued economic growth and the
Government's promotion of industrial growth outside of Bangkok. It would also
extend electricity availability to those villages in Thailand which do not yet
have access to power. The basic planning of the distribution system in the area
to be served by the project has been comprehensively carried out during the
feasibility study stage.   Detailed engineering design, for which consultants
would be appointed, should, therefore, proceed fairly smoothly. Implementation
of the transmission lines and substations is being planred on a single
responsibility basis under turnkey contracts which should result in speedy
execution of the project. The risk of delay in timely execution of the project,



- 5 -
which could affect progress of industrial and commercial development in the area,
could be due to delays in taking decisions on procurement. Accordingly, specific
milestone dates for procurement will be set and closely monitored by the Bank.
The risk of load growth not materializing as forecast is minimal, given the
development potentia' of the area.   However, the project returns are robust
enough to maintain its economic viability at slower than anticipated growth in
energy sales.
18.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
