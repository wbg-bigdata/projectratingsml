PUNO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1812-PE)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Puno Rural
Development Project in Peru, for which Loan No. 1812-PE in the amount of
US$15.0 million was approved on March 18, 1980. The loan was closed on
June 30, 1987. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on
June 11, 1987.
2.       The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based, inter alia,
on the Draft Completion Report prepared by the Borrower, progress reports
of the Project Unit (PU), the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee,
and Project Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda. No completion mission
travel was undertaken to the project area because of security concerns.i
3.       This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on March 1, 1990, for comments by
April 19, 1990, but none were received.

PVWO RURAL DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1812-PE),
Evaluation  numaryX
Objectives
1.       The Puno Rural Development Project was designed as a first step in
the Government of Peru's (GOP) strategy of poverty alleviation in the An-
dean Highlands (Sierra), one of the most densely populated and most impove-
rished regions of the country.
2.       The objective of this project was to increase the income of
approximately 17,000 low-income rural families and to improve their quality
of life. This objective was to be attained by the provision of irrigation,
agricultural credit, afforestation, crop and livestock estension and
applied research,  rural roads, health posts, potable water systems and
vocational training.   Studies for a much larger second phase were also
included.
3.       The project, a pilot for much lweger efforts planned in the
future, was slated to cost US$27.3 million, 'f which the loan provided
US$15 million (55 percent).  The two most cosuiy components were expected
to be credit 4US$8 miUlion or 37 percent of allocated costs) and irrigation
(US$3-9 million or 18 percent of allocated costs).  As a result of disa-
greements over interest rate policy, the Borrower r-'dertook to finance all
of the credit component.
Zmilementation
4.       While loan effectiveness took place more than 16 months after
approval by the Bank, in retrospect, the strict effectiveness conditions
may have been essential to the successful start-up of the project. There-
fore, at effectiveness, the Project Unit was set up and operatlng with a
bank account, fully staffed and its consultants recruited; the subsidiary
agreement with the Agricultural Bank was signed; and the various coordi-
nating committees and organlziations established.
5.       During  implementation,  the project  suffered  from the  general
governmental retrenchment in Perw so that local funds were often delayed or
short. It suffered from droughts and floods. The coordinating bodies did
not coordinate much, so that the project sometimes experienced competition
from NGOs giving away what it was selling.  And, with so many components,
coordination within  the project was difficult.    Project Unit  leaders
changed and staff morale was sometimes low.- Nevertheless, with a strong
and dedicated leader for five years, the project made great progress.
6.        The project's two largest components did not work as planned.
There was little demand for credit, even at heavily subsidized rates. The
credit the Agricultural Bank extended was only 17 percent of expectations.
And irrigation results were far from expectations, although the projected



- vi -
amount of money was spent.   There had been no engineering or agronomic
feasibility studies for the irrigation sub-projects agreed to at appraisal.
The new sib-project, Buena Vista, proved to be uneconomic and was droppe'.
Activities were re-oriented to rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure.
Nevertheless, farmers showed little interest in irrigation, certainly in
paying water charges for it.  (The studies covenant on wate, charges was
not fulfilled.) £n the event, 1,465 ha were rehabilitated instead of 3,200
(46 percent), the 400 ha new project was not built, and 29 ha of small-
scale systems were build instead of the 500 h., projected (6 percent).
7.       Most other components were able to achiive or exceed their physi-
cal implementation targets, albeit often with some time lag. This was the
case for roads, tree planting, drinking-water supply, health facilities,
vocational training, research, and telephones and post offices. An impres-
sive extension service was built up for both crops and livestock, though
the cropped area covered did not reach appraisal projections.             -
8.       The general suspension of TBRD disbursements to Peru in May 1987
brought IBRD financing of the project to a halt.  No disbursements have
been made since June 11, 1987 and the closing date of June 30, 1987 has not
been extended.  However, the undisbursed balance of $0.54 million has not
been cancelled.   IBRD has requested documentation regarding use of funds
already disbursed into the project's Special Account or return of those
funds. IBRD is awaiting a response to this request.
Results
9.       It is too early to make a firm judgement on the success of the
project in terms of crop and animal output.   Nevertheless, an initial
assessment suggeata that the project was responsible for   - significant
increase in crop and livestock production- (though to a lesser degree than
had been envisaRed at appraisal).  The project's main achievements weret
(a) creating a well-or;^anized, experienced and responsive local imple-
menting agency (the PU); (b) improving the rural road system and the capa-
city to maintain it; (c) establishing well-organized agricultural extension
services and achieving overall higher yields; and (d) providing needed
social services.  It is expected that the PU will continue to fulfill its
much needed development role in the area, even though Bank financing has
ceased.
10.      The project's main shortcoming was lower-than-expected actieve-
ments in rehabilitating irrigation schemes and building new ones, higher-
than-expected unit costs of these works, and much lower than expected
farming results with irrigation. Also, credit demand was far below expec-
tations, despite high subsidies.   There is no evidence, however, that
failure to achieve credit targets constrained farming or livestock deve-
lopment.
11.      The demand for irrigation, especially in medium-scale schemes, wAs
disappointing because the farmers were not interested in adopting new tech-
nology for fear of the effects of night frosts on irrigated crops.   It
appears that the major constraint on farm yields in the project area is not
availability of water but of heat.   Because of their assessment of the
benefits of irrigation, farmers lacked interest in building on-farm irriga-
tion canals and organizing water users' associations to carry out operation
and maintenance (0OM) of the irrigation schemes.   Furthermore,  farmers

using  irrigation water were reluetant to pay more than' nominai water
charges.
Sustainability
12.      It is particularly difficult to assess the project's sustaina-
bility,  only partly because no completion mission was possible.   Much
depends on both local and Government support for the PU, and for the public
fazilitiess roads, public drinking water, health programs, education buil-
dings, post offices and telephones, storehouses, mothers' clubs, etc.,
built up under the project.
13.       An far as crops and lives.tock are concerned, it is difficult to
comment on sustainability without knowing what caused the important and
gratifying increases in yields.  If they stem from the project's adaptive
research and extension, as seems likely, then the gains have been added to
farmers' and ranchers' stock of knowledge and are likely to be sustainec.
If the research, extension,- and input supply components themselves are
sustained, then the results of the project's first six years suggest that
more agricultural windfalls are possible.
141.     The benefits of irrigation in the project environment must be
regarded as unproved.   Reported irrigated yields are not significantly.
better than rainfed yield, certainly not enough to justify the cost.
Farmers' fears may ha,.a been well grounded.
Findings and Lessons
15.      Three lessons may be drawn from this projects
- Firstly, in a very remote and deprived region that had not
received much attention, a modest amount of attention to
applied research, extension, and input supply for farmers and
ranchers can produce significant results.
-  Secondly, weak project preparatior was costly.   There was a
failure to judge the reluctance of potential irrigators to risk
adopting the new technology, or to try to understand the rea-
sons for that reluctance.   The irrigation component passed
through appraisal without engineering or agronomic feasibility
studies of any of the sub-projects. Agronomic studies ought to
have identified the modest attractions of irrigations in most
sub-projects (there may be exceptions in certain micro-climatic
niches).   The  subsequent feasibility study of Buena Vista
proved it uneconomic even with optimistic agronomic assump-
tions.
- Thirdly, while it was difficult to coordinate such a wide range
of activities as were supported by this project, the existence
of a well-motivated and competent PU ensured sufficient flexi-
bility to crease a successful project. An outstanding-example
of this was the PU's ability to respond to unpredictable events
such as drought in the l982l3 crop year and the 1985/6 floods,
which required substantial modification of targets and rede-
ployment of resources. The project is a lesson in the benefits
of good management.



PROJECT COIPLETION REPORT
PEBU
PUNO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1812-PR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       Agriculture contributes about 152 of Peru's Gross Domestic Product
but employs more than 401 of its labor force. The growth of agricultural
output, and especially food production, has lagged behind population growth
for the last 20 years. Approximately 55? of the country's agricultural
population lives in the-Sierra, with an average of about 1.9 ha of cropland
per family.
2.       In the late 1970's the GOP adopted a strategy to promote
development in the Sierra. After eight years of concentrating the public
sector's human and financial resources in an ambitious agrarian reform
program, the Government committed itself to: (a) stimulating agricultural
productivity and output on the newly created Agrarian Reform Enterprises
(ARE) as well as on privately-owned farms; and (b) fostering the
development of rural populations, largely concentrated in the Sierra, that
had so far benefitted little from the agrarian reform or from the large-
scale investment programs implemented on the Coast.
3.       The Puno Rural Development Project was a modest first-phase rural
development project located in the Juliaca area of Puno in the southern
Sierra. As such, it was the first significant attempt to put the GOP's
rural development objectives into practice.
Proiect Area
4.       The Juliaca micro-region lies wholly within the Department of
Puno, in the southeast of Peru, with a population of about 200,000 in 1981.
Its total land area is 855,800 ha in a strip on Lake Titicaca at altitudes
ranging from 3,810 to 4,200 meters above sea level. The micro-region
consists mainly of a wide elevated plateau, with most of the agricultural
land at the lower altitudes. The climate is harsh and is characterized by:
(a) low temperatures; (b) low, unreliable and highly seasonal rainfall
(average 565 mm per year, of which 87? falls between November and April).
Frost hazards occur at night mostly during the dry season (July-August)
but potentially at any time of the year, and hail is common from November
to March.1 Soil suitability for agriculture varies widely within the area,
as do drainage requirements. Groundwater resources are substantial, but are
only used on a small scale.
5.       Of the total population of the micro-region, about two-thirds live
in rural areas. There are about 30,000 families engaged in agriculture,
composed as follows: (a) more than 402 minifundistas (average 1.1 ha of
land; farm income US$7e per year in 1977) who engage in part-time labor to
supplement their income, mainly as agricultural laborers in the coastal
regions; (b) 45% small farmers (average 12 ha of land; farm income about

-2-
$200 per year in 1977); (c) 2.5? medium-scale farmers (average 20 ha of
land; farming income $580 per year in 197.7); and (d) 12.52 members of the
ARE in the project area (farming income about $550 per family in 1977).
6.       At appraisal there were about 16,000 ha in crops in the micro-
region. Half of this area was in potato production, one quarter in quinua,
20X in barley and small amounts in canihua and legumes.2 Livestock output
included about 3,300 tons of meat (over 50? she.    1.2 million liters of
milk and 1,100 tons fK xool and fibers from the6, and alpaca. Cattle
fattening was also r',ez.iken, mostly by minifundistas and small farmers.
II. PROJECT F0t4ULA?ION
A. Identification and Prenaration
7.       During discussions of the Draft Agricultural Sector Survey Report
with the GOP in February 1977, the GOP and the Bank agreed to initiate
preparation of a first-phase rural development project in the Puna area. A
Peruvian team prepared the project with support from five FAO/CP
preparation missions and the report was sent to the Bank in October 1978.
Since the project was considered to be a pilot project, its financing
provided funds for studies -or a much larger second phase.
B. Annraisal and Reaotiations
8.       The project was appraised by the Bank in MaylJune 1979, negotiated
in February 1V80, and approved by the Board in March 1980. During
negotiations, the Bank withdrew financing of the credit component because
of disagreement on a formula to ensure that Bank-financed production credit
would be incremental to the Peruvian Agricultural Bank's (BAP) normal
credit in the project area. The GOP itself financed credit to BAP and the
percentages of Bank disbursements were increased in other components to
maintain the loan amount. As it turned out, the GOP disbursad only 23Z of
the agresd US$ 8.0 million for agricultural credit.
C. Proiect Obiectives
9.       The objectives of the project were tot (a) increase agricultural
production on approximately 20,000 ha of rainfed crop and pasture lands and
4,100 ha of irrigated lands in the project area, thereby increasing the
incomes of about 17,000 low-income rural families; and (b) to improve the
quality of life of rural families living in the project areas.
D. Prolect Descrigtion
10.      To accomplish these objectives, the project included:
(a) rehabilitation and construction of medium and small irrigation systems,
benefitting about 4,100 ha; (b) credit to finance on-farm investments and
incremental production costs; (c) 1,500 ha of forest plantation for soil
conservation and fuel; (d) an intensive crop and livestock extension

leaves and seeds are edible; the latter are -ich in proteins.  Quinuass
seeds can also be used to produce a beverage.

program; (e) a nutrition program; (f) technical assistance to promote and
strengthen small rural industries; (g) applied crop and livestock research,
an associated training and demonstration program and an irrigation training
and demonstration center; (h) rehabilitation and upgrading of rural roads;
(i) strengthening of the road maintenance capability of the Transport
Ministry in the micro-region, (j) constructior of six post-offices;
(k) construction and equipment of rural health facilities, training and
equipment of rural health agents, and equipment of the already constructed
small hospital in Lampa; (1) construction of small communal potable water
systems; (m) construction and equipment for vocational training centers;
and (n) studies to prepare a second-phase project, covering a much larger
area in the Southern Altiplano.
11.      A Project Unit (PU)  responsible for project execution was
established within ORDEPUNO, the Puno Regional Development Organization,
later CORPUNO, the Puno Development Corporation.
S. Proiect Costs and Financing
12.      The estimated total project cost at appraisal was US$ 27.3
million, with the loan providing US$15.0 million (552 of project costs),
the GOP US$ 11.55 million (422) and project beneficiaries USS 0.79 million
(3X). After completion, the actual project cost amounted to USS 21.4
million, of which 68? was financed by the loan, 312 by the GOP and 1? by
the beneficiaries. The shortfalls in financing were due to: (a) for the
Bank, an increase of the pari-passu in categories 2 and 3 from 80? to 902
under a Special Action Program and a later suspension of disbursement due
to non-payments of arrears by the GOP; (b) for the GOP, very low
disbursement to BAP of funds for the credit component; and (c) for the
beneficiaries, lack of interest in irrigation and therefore in the
provision of labor and local materials for irrigation-related works (Annex
-, Tables 1 and 2).
ITI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Proiect Effectiveness and Start-up
13.      The loan was signed in April 1980 but became effective only on
July 9, 1981 as compliance with the conditions of effectiveness3 became
unexpectedly difficult. The first disbursement was in SepteAber 1981. The
PU underwent a long period of low morale and minimal activity, but this
situation quickly improved once the loan became effective. Project
coordination was difficult at the beginning as implementing agencies
started to carry out their activities without proper knowledge of Bank
guidelines. Shortages of counterpart funds were aggravated in 1982 by a
GOP budget contraction, with a particularly negative impact on the
project's social infrastructure activities.
S/ Establish and staff PU, establish Project Coordinating Committee, -
recruit foreign consultants, sign subsidiary agreement with BAP,
establish PU and BAP accounts, and enact the Supreme Decree regulating
the Decree that established ORDEPUNO.



-4-
B. Proiect Imniementation
14.      Irrisation.  This component set out to rehabilitate three medium-
scale irrigation schemes (Taraco with 1600 ha, Huataquita with 600 ha and
Cabanillas with 1000 ha) and to develop one new one (Buena Vista with
400 ha). It also aimed to construct about 60 small-scale irrigation
schemes, covering about 500 ha.  The existing medium-scale schemes had
suffered from unsatisfactory maintenance and poor usage since their
original construction which had been financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank in the mid-60's.
15.      At the time of appraisal, none of the subprojects had engineering
and agronomic feasibility studies. Consultant studies and field and
experimental data indicated that irrigation could be very profitable at
farm level, provided the right crops were grown, and it was assumed that
with the appropriate promotion, organization and extension, farmers would
be willing to convert to irrigation.
16.      During supervision, however, this assumption was found to be
erroneous. Therefore, in 1982, it was decided to minimize new investment
in irrigation and concentrate on rehabilitating the basic infrastructure.
Investment in secondary and tertiary canals and drains and on-farm
investment were to be delayed until the farmers were better organized to
make proper use of the water. Buena Vista was postponed indefinitely
because preliminary studies indicated water could only be provided at a
very high cost and with limited benefits. Final designs for the three
schemes to be rehabilitated were completed at the end of CY 1982 and the
systems became operational in 1984/85. 1750 ha (552 of the total area
irrigable by medium-scale schemes) were under irrigation by the 87188 crop
year, and it is estimated that about 902 of potentially irrigable areas
will be in operation by 1990, if adequate funding is maintained by the GOP.
17.      The farmers' lack of interest in irrigation is mainly explained by
their fear of frost damage on irrigated crops4 and by the risk that cold
surface irrigation waters in the Altiplano would reduce plant growth and
yields. Those fears were compounded by a lack of knowledge of this
technology and by the previous lack of technical assistance. Other
contributing factors may have been farmers' greater interest in livestock
than in crops, and the frequent need for heads of household to be absent
earning income as agricultural laborers in the coastal tegions. For these
reasons, there was little on-farm development (or demand for credit), or
organization of water users' association for O&M. Even those farmers who
were using water for irrigation were reluctant to pay more than nominal
charges for it. The PU hopes that promotion and technical assistance will
eventually convert more farmers. The 1982183 drought and 1985/86 floods
might have helped convince them of the benefits of increased use of
irrigation and drainage infrastructure.
18.      In contrast to the medium-scale schemes discussed above, the
small irrigation systems show promising acceptance records. The program
originally involved about 60 systems aimed at bringing an additional 500 ha
under irrigation, but it was agreed during a 1983 supervision mission to
Al The project preparation team had considered that crops had "increased
resistance from the night frost when the soil is humid'.



-5-
concentrate on the construction of only half of these systems, which have
now been completed. These small schemes take advantage of local frost-free
micro-climatic conditions, favorable for vegetables (potatoes, onions) and
pastures. From the beginning, studies favored small gravity schemes for
10-15 ha, benefitting 80-100 farmers at a cost of US$ 800-1000 per ha of
irrigation. However, systems requiring pumps were also sometimes
necessary. The project provided subsidies to minifundistas producing for
their own consumption which covered all costs (technical studies, L.achinery
and pumps if necessary) except local labor and construction materials.
19.      The General Directorate for Water, Soil and Irrigation (DGASI)
demonstrated great competence in the preparation of studies for small
systems. It also supervised the studies for the medium-scale systems. In
addition, DGASI supervises farmers' O&M of small systems and advises them
on performing some maintenance work.
20.      Agricultural Credit.  The credit program lagged seriously behind
appraisal targets. As appraised, the project was to provide technical
assistance and credit to approximately 14,000 small and medium farmers and
seven ARE (with 3,000 farmers) in the project area. The project called for
13,000 short- or long-term loans over five years, but in spite of the PU's
promotional efforts, 5 the total number of loans extended was only 1,456
over the seven years of the project, only 45 of them long-term. As a
result, the Ministry of Economy and Finance disbursed only 21Z of the USS
8.0 million agreed upon in the Loan A4reement. The failure to meet project
targets arose mainly from the aversion of small farmers to risk and
indebtedness, which had been misjudged at appraisal. The availability of
other more highly subsidized credit lines in the region was also an
important contributory factor. Severe droughts in 1982 further reduced
demand for credit and some farmers were unable to meet payments due on
their production loans.
21.      Lending to the ARE was curtailed for other reasons.  These loans
required a prior review of the managerial, financial and production
capabilities of each enterp.i.se and the adoption of measures to correct
perceived weaknesses. Early in the project, the PU's ARE Development Staff
identified the ARE's problems as political in nature and decided to
interrupt credit processing until these were corrected.
22.      Forestry.  This component progressed well throughout the
implementation period.   Two nurseries for growing seedlings were
established on land not suitable for crops and livestock, and in the
ensuing years 2,243 ha of eucalyptus, cypress, pine and native species were
planted, surpassing appraisal targets by over 502. Over 5,000 families
5/ (i) The PU requested and reached an agreement that *certificados de
posesion' (or property certificates) be accepted as collateral in
investment, credit applications. However, certificates turned out to be
difficult and cumbersome to obtain from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food; (ii) promotional loans not exceeding US$ 500 were offered to
first-time credit applicants on a one-time only basis at a highly
subsidized interest rate. This ceiling was subsequently increased to
US$ 1500 for production loans and $3000 for investment loans; and (iii)
lending was accompanied with technical assistance &a PU supervision.



-6-
benefitted from the forests by obtaining a new source of fuel and income
from the sale of wood cuttings.
23.      Agricultural Extensiot.  This component did well in all three
subcomponents: technical assistance for crop and livestock; nutrition; and
small rural industries (Annex I, Table 3). Adoption of new technology was
hindered by local factors such as: (a) an accelerated fragmentation of
minifundia, further limiting demand for credit and agricultural machinery;
(b) migration to supplement income; and (c) the uncoordinated presence of
many philanthropic agencies distributing food, agricultural tools and
inputs which diminished the interest of farmers on community self-help
endeavors.
24.      Technical assistance for crop and livestock adopted the Training
and Visits (T&V) extension usthodology from the start and achieved some
remarkable results in yields, livestock and number of activities (Table 4.3
and Annex I, Table 3). Although T&V was adopted with some adjustments,
including programmed visits to groups, group leaders, services to producers
(artificial insemination and demonstrations), it still needed further
adjustments to integrate the local community orientation and it was
subsequently modified with the help of ANZDEC consultants from New Zealand.
25.      Nutrition and Small Industries.  The nutrition subcomponent
operated through the promotion of community organizations, formal and
informal education and technical assistance to increase and diversify food
production. It targeted 85 communities in the Juliaca micro-region. 'The
PU nutrition staff made good progress in developing a program based on the
training of community members in agricultural extension by establishing
vegetable gardens, small animal husbandry and home economics. These
promoters worked with community members in a variety of activities, perhaps
the most important being the organization of 74 mothers' clubs. Over 2000
families participated in social and educational activities in l986 alone.
In addition, the small industry subcomponent provided much needed advice to
73 small rural industries.
26.      Agricultural Research.  Most targets specified at appraisal were
achieved (Annex I, Table 4). Three research stations were completed: the
Illpa Crop and Livestock Station, the Tahuaca Experimental Station and the
Pirapu Irrigation Demonstration Center. Equipment installation began in
1980 and experiments in 1980/81. About half the experiments are carried
out on crops and half on livestock. The results were succet-fully
Incorporated in the technological packages transferred by the extension
agents. By mid-87, 65 experiments had been carried out on potatoes,
barley, quinua, canihua, pastures, sheep and alpacas, and 62 field testing
plots established.  In mid-1983, given limitations on the use of          I
artificial insemination for cattle in the dispersed smallholder situation,
the PU agreed to develop a system of distribution of suitable bulls to
communities to arriveœat a more widespread genetic improvement in milk/beef
animals.
27.      Roads and Covmamications.  This was one of the most important
components of the project. At appraisal it was proposed that the Ministry
of Transport should build and maintain the roads, but because of their
Regional Directorate's scarce budgetary resources, manpower, design
capacity and equipment, it was considered more practical to do it through



-7-
local contractors and force account, supervised by the PU. Therefore the
PU assumed responsibility for execution of the component. There were no
details or technical specifications provided for this componetit in the
appraisal report or working papers. The project constructed 370 km of
paved roads and 437 km of dirt roads and maintained 259 km of paved roads
and 340 km of dirt roads, well above the appraisal estimate of 515 km in
total. It also rehabilitated Juliaca's main paved and dirt roads rapidly
after the floods. In addition, six post-offices were built and equipped,
and eight telecommunications systems were installed in rural communities.
28.      Rural Health.  The physical targets of this component were
achieved, and improved services are now provided to the target population.
Nevertheless, health coverage is still far from adequate.  By 1987, the PU
had organized the training of about 50 volunteer health promoters and
provided them with health testing equipment and bicycles, to provide at
least minimal health services to remote villages. Expansion of the
regional health services has been hampered by stress caused by constant
change in the central government, including a drastic reorganization of
the national health system. The small Lampa hospital, in spite of its
remodeling and equipment, is still overstaffed and underused with several
empty wards and with such a small budget that it has been unable to repair
the ambulance obtained through the project.
29.      Drinkina Water.  Provision of drinking water was a major benefit
under the project. Some wells constructed during the early years of the
project were poorly sited, and their water was contaminated by nearby
sewage. However, this was later corrected through the use of specialized
consultants to select well sites. Initial targets have been significantly
surpassed (Table 4.1), and some 15,000 existing shallow wells have been
purified by chlorination.
30.      Vocational Training.  Twenty-two rural Occupational Education
Centers were built and equipped and are in use by the communities.
However, several problems arose in implementing this component: (a) some
centers had no provision for teachers; (b) some were constructed where
neither the Ministry of Education nor the community wanted them; (c) some
received inappropriate equipment not previously discussed with the
Ministry; and (d) others had no provisions for operation, maintenance or
educational materials.
31.      Studies and Follow-un Prolect Prenaration.  Preparation of a
second phase project was stalled in April 1986 because of the GOP's non-
payment of arrears to the Bank.
C.  Chwages Durina Implementation
32.      As is appropriate in complex projects such as this one, many
changes in scope and objectives occurred during implementation. These were
provoked both by more detailed study and by catastrophic weather
conditions. For instance, during a supervision mission in 1982 the Bank
and the GOP agreed to suspend the construction of the Buena Vista
irrigation system because studies indicated it was not viable. In response
to weather conditions, a seed potatoes program was introduced with the 1983
Emergency Program prompted by the drought. In addition, the PU expanded
activities in several fields and added new sub-Components, as described in



-8-
the preceding paragraphs. The PU demonstrated its excellent organizing
ability, when, following the early 1986 catastrophic floods, it proved to
be the only organization able to take immediate and effective rescue action
and later to undertake road and other infrrstructure rehabilitation works.
D. Disburseuents
33.      At appraisal, it was agreed that each agency would maintain
separate accounts for its own component and be responsible for preparing
their monthly statement of expenses and supporting material for submission
to the PU.- )%he PU would authorize reimbursement from the Project Account.
This system workad well, especially after PU staff became acquainted with
Bank procedures and the Special Account was established.
34.      The general suspension of IBRD disbursements to Peru in May 1987
brought IBRD financing of the project to a halt. No disbursements were
made after June 11, 1987 and the closing date of June 30, 1987 was not
extended. Once the full amount of the initial deposit to the special
account-was recovered, the undisbursed balance of US$0.54 million was
cancelled effective January 31, 1990.
R. Procurement
35.      Because of the area's remoteness very few Peruvian and no foreign
contractors were interested in bidding for civil works in the region.
Therefore, the PU resorted more to local procurement and fcrcQ account than
had been originally foreseen. International competitive bidding procedures
were followed for -Lwe pool of heavy and agricultural machinery and for
health equipment.
F.  Comwliance with Loan Covenants
36.      Compliance with loan covenants was satisfactory, except for the
preparation of a socio-economic study of water users repayment capacity.
The absence of this study was officially explained by the lack of data and
by delays in completing the irrigation schemes. However, the PU was not
actually interested in preparing this study, knowing that water users would
resist paying realistic water charges. This has been the case with all
other irrigation projects in Peru.
IV. PROJECT IPACT
A. Physical Develoment
37.      Most physical targets were met or surpassed.  Table 4.1 summarizes
these accomplishments.
B. Agricultural Imnact
38.      It is too soon to measure the agricultural Impact of the project,
although preliminary data indicate that it was positive. At project
completion, crop yields and livestock parameters were broadly higher. but
on-farm development (as measured by the cropped area) had not met
appraisal estimates. Complete information on incremental production is not
available, making it difficult to obtain an accurate measurement of the
project's full impact on agricultural production and incomes.

39.      The development of the cropp4d area (Table 4.2) differed widely
from that predicted at appraisal.  The project was expected to bring about
an increase in the cropped area from 11,960 ha to 12,300 ba and a change in
the cropping pattern. At completion, information on only 9,481 ha was
available, but it seems unlikely that any net increase in the cropped area
took place. The main factor here was the lower than expected uptake of
irrigation.

40.      The overall cropping pattern was expected to be altered by an
increase in the area devoted to potatoes and other crops (beans,
vegetables), a reduction in the area under barley, and the elimination of
canihua. The quinua area was expected to -remain about the same. In fact,
the cropping pattern changed quite differently. In rainfed areas, there
was a lesser area planted to potatoes and quinua, and an increased area
planted to canihua, harley and other crops.
41.      Crop yields (Table 4.3) were expected to increase due to
additional use of improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and changes in
cultivation practices. These changes werO to be brought about by a more
efficient extension servicE, expanded and improved infrastructur4 and the
provision of credit.  At completion, yields were indeed higher, mainly as a
result of improved researe, extension and infrastructure. Credit was not
a significant tactor in this improvement..

42.      ?he extension efforts also supported an increase in livestock
production. At c.mpletion, information was available on increases in milk
and wool production and carcass weight, which for the most part surpassed
appraisal targets. No data were available on the total incremental
livestock production, number of animals affected or their distribution into
type of production unit (minifundio, small or medium farm or ARE).
C. Economic Imuact
43.      On account of the security situation, it was not possible to carry
out a PCR mission, and there is no reliable data base for estimating the
economic impact of the project. A meaningful ex-post economic analysis
cannot be carried out. However, there is no doubt that the final economic
rate of return would be very much less than the appraisal estimate of 27
per cent. The following factors account for this: (a) the iL.rigation
infrastructure was only completed in 1985, two years behind schedule:
(b) less than half the farme:s in the potential irrigation areas had
adopted irrigation technology by the closing date, and only a very gradual
rate of adoption is now expected (at appraisal it was estimated that all
4200 ha would be under irrigation by 1983); (c) only about 102 of the
agricultural credit estimated at appraisal was actually ised; and (d) the
project became effective only in 1981, and took seven years instead of five
to be completed. The prospects for the project have further been cast into
doubt on account of the deteriorating economic and security situation in
the area.
44.      The project benefits were further constrained by the distortions
induced by high inflation and dual exchange rates during the implementation
period. Inflation ranged from 672 to 1252 annually, costs of production
and the value of sales were seriously distorted and changed on a month-by-
month basis. Also, the official exchange rate was held below the financial
arket rate, which had a premium varying from 1.4Z to 87.4t. These
conditions discouraged investment, created shortages of foreign exchange
required to purchase foreign inputs, reduced benefits and rendered any
further analysis of results impossible.
D. Social and Environmental Imoact
45.      In spite of the problems noted above, the project had a positive
impact on the living standards and the environment in the project area. It
brought about substantial investment in human capital and provided needed
rural infrastructure and social services. Human capital investment
included the training of extension personnel. comnunity leaders and
farmers, small entrepreneurs and rural health agents. Rural infrastructure
(roads, post offices and telecommunication systems) was built to facilitate
mobility and communications.   Eight hundred and eighty small rural
buildings, consisting of baths, drinking fountains, silos, wells, latrines,
conmunal stores and meeting places, stables and other small works were
constructed to improve living conditions. Health coverage (previously
almost non-existent) was expanded, education was diversified with more
vocational training, and water was made available and safe to drink in many
more places than before.
46.      The environment of the project area was improved by several
project activities. Of particular mention are the irrigation component,
which provided means to promote water management, and the forestry



- 13 -
component, which established more than 2300 ha of trees, promoting soil
conservation and land management, preventing further soil erosion and
providing wood for fuel and construction needs.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Institutional Imnact
47.      In 1982, the ORDEPUNO, the. organization originally proposed to
coordinate all development efforts in the region (and within which the PU
was administratively located) was replaced by CORPUNO, which turned out to
provide little real coordination. In this context, the PU emerged as an
independent and capable implementing unit.   The main force behind the
success of the PU was a capable and motivated director who led it for five
of its seven and a half years. Table 5.1 presents the PU staff composition
at project completion.

B. Project Coordination
48.      Project coordination was a problem both within the project, and
with other development activities in the region. Within the project, the
implementation of eleven components made it difficult to focus on any given
activity.  Too much energy was absorbed in trying to make some components
work (especiFlly irrigation) to the detriment of other activities. For
example, because of lack of coordination with the respective ministries,
some vocational education centers were left without!teachers, health posts
had not trained personnel, and effects regarding education, nutrition and
health remained uncoordinated.



_ 14 -
49.      In spite of repeated requests from the Bank, the Pt was unable to
coordinate its actions with other agencies working towards similar goals.
For instance, they were unable to draw the lessons from other irrigation
experiences in the region in order to improve their own approach in the
Puno project. Inter-institutional coordination was not helped by the fact
that CORPUWO, the entity in charge of coordination of development projects
in the re& an, was never able to bring together all the development efforts
of national and foreign agencies working in the region.
C. Consultants
50.      As in other rural development projects, the Borrower agreed to
employ qualified consultants to assist in implementing the project (Loan
Agreement Section 3.05). In this project, the contribution of the
expatriate consulting team was not key to the success of the project,
because the PU itself benefitted from capable and motivated national
management for most of the project life.
D. Agricultural Extension
51.      The project created an agricultural extension service in the area,
with 33 university graduates and 33 technicians. This service operated in
coordination with the research teams, by including their results into their
technological packages. As Table 4.3 and Annex I, Table 3 suggest, the
extension service was successful with crops and livestock and in creating
mechanisms to disseminate improved seeds. The service transferred higher
yielding technological packages for existing crops to the area's farmers,
particularly to the small and minifwtdio farmers who were the service's
main target group, and it introduced new crops (garlic, onions, and some
vegetables). It also promoted animal husbandry by improving livestock
quality through a program of swaps and loans of bovine, ovine and alpaca
breeders. Animal health was improved by better veterinary care. Finally,
the extension service supported a revolving fund, where farmers could
borrow and reimburse in kind (seeds or part of their harvest), ensuring
availability of seeds for new farmers for the next season.
E. Irrigation Oneration. Maintenance and Water Charies
52.      At project completion, only about 50Z of areas with rehabilitated
infra'tructure were under irrigation.   On-farm development, the
organization of water users' associations, O&M of tertiary canals, and
studies on a tariff system to recover O&M costs were all lagging. Some
irrigation committees had been organized, and some farmers were performing
ah adequate maintenance job on tertiary canals, but all farmers were still
unwilling to pay more than token water charges. Appraisal estimates were
not realistic about the willingness of the farmers and the GOP to recover
the costs of O&4.
VI. BANK PERFOU4ACE-
53.      In spite of frequent supervision from the Bank, project !
implementation took much longer than had been foreseen at appraisal, partly
because feasibility studies for the irrigation components were not
available. At appraisal in 1979,, it was assumed that the project would be
completed after four and a half years, but it soon became clear that works



_  15
c.uld not be completed by December 1984, especially in view of the
complexity of the project, lack of detailed technical studies, the delay in
effectiveness until September 1981, and droughts in the 1982183
agricultural year. This was later aggravated by heavy floods in the
1985/86 crop year. Frequent supervision missions, good continuity of
supervision staff and stable project management helped sustain momentum in
spite of setbacks in credit demand and the adoption of irrigation
technology. The Rank was less successful in ensuring compliance with loan
covenants related to O&M and water charges and disbursements for the credit
component.
- VIZ. LESNS  L EARD
54.      This project was the first phase of an ambitious vegional
development plan for the Sierra. It achieved many of its physical targets,
especially in transport, health, education and water supply. It Ws less
successful, however, in modernizing the traditional agricultural sector.
The main lessons are as followsa
(a) Like many similar RD projects, this project did not
accoknplish as much as had been predicted at appraisal. There
was a lack of involvement of the potential beneficiaries at
the preparation stage which led to a misjudgment of their
viilingness to take risks with irrigation and credit.
(b) The project was too complex. Its many components created
problems of coordination which were difficult to overcome,
and which de'ayed execution, in spite of above average
management. In retrospect, it is probable that a more
focussed effort would have yielded better results.
(c) In spite of the low success rate in irrigation and credit,
the research, extension, institutional and social services
components were all highly successful, due to good
micro-management and good project coordination. The project
created an efficient and well-organized PU w-ith 180 staff,
capable of responding to emergencies, and provided ne4Aed
social infrastructure to one of the poorest, remotest and
most densely populated areas in Latin America.
(d) The history of this project demonstrates the importance and
the impact of good, well-motivated management. As a pilot
project for a broader regional approach it was a qualified
success and served to establish a corps of well-trained and
well-motivated professionals. In spite of recent political
and economic events, this may still be of major long-term
benefit to the Peruvian rural sector.
