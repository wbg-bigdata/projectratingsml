MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRtCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TBiE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FONDO NACIONAL DE CAMINOS VECINALES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE
SECOND RURAL ROADS SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Fcndo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (FNCV) of Colombia for US$55.0
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
on standard IBRD terms with 17 years of maturity, including five years of
grace, and would help finance a rural roads sector investment and
maintenance project.
2.       Background.  The transport network developed considerably, though
not evenly, during the past thirty yearsa investments in farm-to-market
access and intra-regional connections were not been given adequate priority
nor were they coordinated with inter-regional transport infrastructure,
Today, the Government recognizes that the lack of sufficient adequately
built and maintained roads is a major constraint to efficient transport
services. User charges more than cover the maintenance, rehabilitation and
expansion costs associated with national, regional and local roads in
Colombia, but funds need to be mo's rationally allocated and spent between
the three networks.
3.       FNCV, an autonomous central Government agency since 1972
responsible for planning, constructing and maintaining rural roads, is the
only agency that adequately manages rural roads and implements Government
policies in the sector, and is capable of assisting local authorities,
under the recent decentralization scheme, to develop maintenance management
capacity. In the last ten years, the extension of the rural road network
under FNCV has grown at about 42 annually, from 16,300 km in 1979 to 25,200
km at present. The Bank's involvement, through two past loans, was
instrumental in sustaining this expansion ana building FNCV's project
implementation capacity. There remains, at the same time, scope to further
develop its institutional strength, especially for maintenance, which, in
the past, did not receive sufficient attention, partly because
responsibilities between local, regional and national administration levels
were never defined. This lack of definition has also been a major obstacle
*          to developing an adequate institutional, financial and policy framework in
transport.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank supports the
Government's efforts to accelerate economic growth through, inter alia,
ensuring adequate infrastructure to promote expansion of private sector
productive activities. In line with this, continuing Bank assistance for
rural roads will contribute through maintained and improved road access,
to provide conditions favorable to economic growth and higher living
standards in rural areas. Bank participation in the project will also
contribute to implement road sector aspects of the decentralization policy,



- 2 -
recently set in place, in a way which will clar'fy responsibilities, define
financing arrangements, and develop the institutional capacity needed at
the local level to manage the rural roads network.
5.       Project Objectives.  In line with the general objectives of
expanding markets and improving living conditions in rural areas, the
project will specifically: (a) help define road management functions and
responsibilities of national, regional and local authorities, and
strengthen their activities; (b) ensure satisfactory implementation of key
policies in the roads sector, including those related to decentralization
of decision-making to local governments, planning, coordination,
maintenance and resource mobilization: and (c) contribute to financing a
balanced four-year investment and maintenance program.
6.       Project Description.  The project is FNCV's 1990-1993 Investment
and Maintenance Program, and has been prepared to address rural roads
priorities and consolidate and further develop effective road management.
Only selective new construction has been considered under the project,
basically targeted to complete road accesses and support efforts to
alleviate rural poverty, increase agriculture production and facilitate
provision of social services. Improvement, construction and the
substantive part of the periodic maintenance road works of the project will
be carried out under contract with regional and national civil engineering
construction firms. Routine maintenance, some periodic maintenance, and
annual emergency works will be carried out through FNCV's own force
account. Investments in training, studies and supervision of civil works,
and in institutional strengthening of FNCV itself and the local
administrations are also included in the project.
7.       The main project components are: (a) maintenance, including
resurfacing works on 4,400 km of roads (39.OZ of the project's cost); (b)
improvement civil works along 1,650 km of existing dry-weather roads,
including completion of bridges and drainage structures (26.72); (c)
construction civil works for 950 km of rural roads (25.5Z); (d) repairs and
spare parts for road maintenance equipment (0.9Z); (e) consulting services
to design and supervise civil works (6.7Z); and (f) training activities,
technical assistance services and studies, including the review of road-
funding strategies, in light of increased resources available to local
governments and declining tax-revenues available to FNCV (1.2Z).
Implementation performance and programmed activities will be jointly and
twice-yearly reviewed by FNCV and the Bank. The focus of civil works
financing will be on maintenance and improvement contracts, with sub-
project selection and financing, acceptable to the Bank, tied to suitably
drawn up, financed and implemented action programs for road maintenance by
local governments, aimed to gradually building their institutional
capacity. The total cost of the project, to be carried out over four
years, is estimated at $157.1 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of $83.9 million (53Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the statue of Bank Group operations
in Colombia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7985-CO dated October 25, 1989, are also
attached.



-3-
8.       Agreed Actions.  To carry out maintenance, coordinate road
activities between different levels of the government structure, assist in
developing capacity in local governments to manage maintenance of rural
roads, and implement the decentralization policy, FNCV, in the course of
project preparation, established a Haintenance Division, strengthened its
regional offices, and prepared the necessary regulation to coordinate among
national, regional and local administrations. A decree establishing
Regional Coordinating Committees was issued, and the investments and
maintenance expenditures proposed for selection and inclusion in the
project for the first year (1990) were reviewed and found acceptable by the
Bank. The Government has approved functions and staff positions in FNCV's
Maintenance Division and regional offices, vhich the Bank reviewed and
found acceptable. In addition, key staff have been confirmed in place in
FNCV's regional offices where sub-projects will be implemented during the
first year (1990). Furthermore, during negotiations, the following
agreements were confirmed:
(i) prior to considering eligibility of civil works sub-projects in
any region, the Bank to review and be satisfied with the number
and quality of FNCV staff assigned to the respective regional
office and the quality of the respective engineering studies;
(ii) adoption of economic-environmpntal evaluation methods and
procedures for selecting and including in the project civil works
and maintenance sub-projects; revisions, if warranted, to be made
from time to time during Bank/FNCV reviews; construction and
improvement sub-projects to be selected only if they yield ERRs
higher than 12Z, and after priority allocation of funds to
maintenance activities;
(iii) FNCV, together with local administrations involved in the project,
to draw up monitorable action programs, including training, with
time-bound targets, beginning not later than September 30, 1990,
and to develop the latter's caracity to assume, within a
reasonable time frame, full responsibility for maintenance
management of their respective road networks; such programs to be
monitored and reviewed twice a year by the Bank and FNCV, and with
the local governments when so required by the Bank, beginning not
later than September 30, 1990;
(iv) for 1991 and every year thereafter, prior to considering
eligibility of civil works sub-projects in any region, the Bank to
a                     review aad be satisfied with the implementation performance of
FNCV's routine and periodic maintenance programs during the
preceding year, and the action programs drawn up with and
implemented by the local governments; the Bank to have the right
to suspend disbursements on sub-projects in municipalities/regions
that fail to meet their agreed obligations;
(v) FNCV, with assistance from the National elanning Department (DNP),
to study new strategies for mobilizing revenues for rural roads by
not later than August 31, 1990; the Government, through DNP, to
formulate and discuss with the Bank a related program of actions,
acceptable to the Bank, by not later than December 31, 1990;



a 4 -
(vi) the Government, through the Ministry of Public Works and Transport
(MOPT), to complete the condition inventory of all roads (except
national highways) by not later than July 31, 1990, have a
functional-jurisdictional road classification proposal by not
later than October 31, 1990, end put into effect or submit to
Congress the corresponding regulation by not later than January
31, 1991;
(vii) beginn ng in 19S0, PNCV to prepare and submit it_ yearly budget,
and the Government to approve the format, by regional or activity
sub-programs, and not by individual sub-projects;
(viii) the project, its Implementation and funding to be monitored and
reviewed jointly by FNCV and the Bank, by not later than March 31
and September 30 of each year, beginning not later than March 31,
1990; based on the conclusions of the review, any necessary
actions to improve implementation to be drawn up and executed;
(ix) value and justification of road works proposed for direct
contracting and force account to be reviewed and monitored twice-
yearly by PNCV/Bank by not later than March 31 and September 30 of
each year, beginning on March 31, 1990.
9.       Benefits.  By lowering farmers' and consumers' transport costs
while safeguarding the environment, for which specific analyses and
recommendations are to be prepared for each road investment sub-project,
the project is expected to directly benefit the rural population and
production, improving the access to social and market services. Equally
important, it will facilitate the decentralization process in the roads
sector, with FNCV, the regional and the local authorities coordinating and
jointly becoming more responsive to road needs and priorities of the rural
population.
10.      Risk.  An element of risk connected with the project relates to
the ability and readiness of local governments to organize and develop
technical capability to maintain the local road networks effectively. The
risk will be reduced by requiring (a) that action programs, tailored to
each local administration and acceptable to the Bank, be implemented and
monitored, with assistance from FNCV staff, consultants and national
training agencies, aiming at eventually achieving full-fledged transfer of
road maintenance responsibilities; and (b) that FNCV financing be linked to
satisfactory performance in implementing such action programs.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
