YE-U IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma.
Amount:           iDA Credit SDR 12.3 million
(US$14.0 million equivalent).
Terms:            Standard.
Project           The Project would be the first in a series of major
Description:    investments for rehabilitation and modernization of the
large river diversion schemes that account for about 352
of the area under irrigation in Burma. It would provide
for comprehensive repair and modernization of the Ye-U
system (with a cultivable command aree of 121,000 acres),
and for complementary agricultural services to project
area farmers. More broadly, the project would also streng-
thened the Irrigation Department (ID) by (a) supporting a
long-term Master Plan for irrigation rehabilitation and
improved operating procedures for the large diversion
schemes, and (b) creating a system for effective management
(especially maintenance) of ID's large and growing fleet
of heavy equipment. This institutional strengthening would
be achieved through the provision of limited but essential
technical assistance and upgraded mechanical workshop
facilities.  By promoting more intensive agricultural
development through rehabilitation of deteriorated irriga-
tion structures, the prGject would provide a more reliable
supply of irrigation water to about 20,000 farm families
in the Ye-U command area. Improved water management and
strengthened extension and input supply would result in an
increased cropped area, higher yields and an expansion of
overall production. These would help raise farmers' incomes
and improve their living standards.
Risks:            No adverse environmental impact is expected.  A possible
risk would be shortages of fuel and cement. However, these
shortages should be alleviated by the completion of major
works under the Kinda Dam Project.

BURMA
YE-U IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    This report appraises Burma's first irrigation rehabilitation and
modernization project, to be located in the central dry zone of the country.
It would be the first stage in a 25-year master plan for irrigation
rehabilitation, and also an important investment in the Fifth Four-Year Plan
(1985/86-1988/89), of which two objectives are the maintenance of a high
growth rate in agriculture and the promotion of a higher level of agricul-
tural exports. The proposed project would aim to further both of these
objectives.
1.02    In addition to its direct production benefits and its role in
initiating an important Long-term investment program, the proposed project
would focus on institution-building of Irrigation Department (ID), in two
vital areas. First, it would improve the ID's design standards and operating
procedures, to be implemented progressively in all of the large river diver-
sion systems in Burma. Second, the project would strengthen the ID's
currently inadequate mechanical services, by providing improved facilities,
technical training, and a system for managing better the Department's large
and expanding fleet of heavy equipment. Institutional support to the
mechanical wing of ID has been designed as the first stage in a 10-15 year
program to achieve major cost savings through enhanced equipment management
and repair.
1.03    In June 1982, the Government of Burma (GOB) and IDA, assisted by
FAO/CP, identified a possible rehabilitation project in the Ye-U command area
of the larger Mu-Kabo Irrigation System. In September 1982, consultants were
engaged to undertake hydrological and engineering studies of the Ye-U area;
this work was financed by UNDP and supervised by FAO/CP. The initial
preparation report was submitted to the Bank by FAO/CP in May 1984. The
second major part of the project, designed to improve the capacity of the
Irrigation Department to maintain its substantial fleet of heavy earth-moving
equipment, was initially identified by the Covernment and IDA in December
1981. FAO/CP was subsequently requested to carry out more detailed iden-
tification and to oversee preparation of a proposal for strengthening the
ID's Mechanical Branch. A consultant was engaged in late 1982 to study the
feasibility of investments to upgrade the performance of the Branch. Based
on his findings, FAO/CP drafted a preparation report for the Mechanical
Branch components, which was submitted to IDA in February 1984.

1.04    An IDA appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. P. H. Tamboli,
K. Unhanand, R. Hecht (IDA), A. Mackie and Y. K. Murthy (consultants)
visited Burma during November 1984. This report is based on the mission's
findings. 1/
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
The Agriculture Sector
2.01    Composition of the Sector.  The agriculture sector, including
forestry, fisheries, and livestock, dominates Burma's economy, accounting for
about 48% of GDP, 661 of the labor force, and 80Z of exports. Rice is
Burma's major agricultural and export commodity as well as a significant
source of Government revenue through implicit taxation based on official
prices. Paddy is grown principally as a single lowland rainfed crop in the
monsoon period. About 12.5 M acres are sown to paddy annually, representing
more than 50% of the gross cultivated area. In 1983/84, rice accounted for
more than one-third of total agricultural output, and rice and rice products
for an estimated 37% of the value of all merchandise exports. Other main
crops include sesame, pulses, groundnuts, industrial crops, and cereals.
2.02    Performance.  In common with other sectors of the economy, agricul-
tural value-added grew by an average of about 1.6% a year in the 1960s and
early 1970s, below the prevailing population growth rate of 2.2% a year.
Following the major liberalization reforms of the mid-1970s, however, the
agriculture sector underwent considerable transformation. Paddy production
increased by an estimated 7.5% a year between 1974/75 and 1982/83, and
value-added in the sector as a whole rose at about 7.0% a year in real terms.
Since the area under paddy remained broadly constant, the increase in rice
production was due almost entirely to higher yields obtained by Burmese
farmers througb the adoption of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) adapted to
local conditions. Policy reforms which contributed to this significant
improvement in the performance of Burmese agriculture included currency
devaluation, increases in official procurement prices and reductions in
procurement quotas for farm products, and the launching of the Whole Township
Rice Production Program, a nationwide program designed to mobilize farmers
for increased paddy output. On the technical side, the Government success-
fully developed and disseminated a number of HYVs suited to Burmese farming
conditions, adapting these varieties from imported seeds from other Asian
countries.
2.03    Future Prospects for Agriculture.  Although paddy yields will
inevitably rise more slowly in the future, now that the most obvious oppor-
tunities have been exploited, there is still considerable scope for improving
the quality of rice. Opportunities also exist for further extending the area

under cultivation through land reclamation. If a rapid growth rate in
agriculture is to be sustained, efforts in the paddy sector will have to be
complemented by increased output of other major crops. In this regard, the
expansion of the Whole Township Program to cover non-paddy crops should lead
to yield increases, particularly for maize and wheat (for which suitable HYV
technologies are available) and for oilseeds. The potential for industrial
crops such aq cotton is also substantial. Further diversification is
feasible for the medium-term through increased production of horticultural
crops, tree crops, livestock, and fisheries. Adequate transport and storage
facilities will also need to be developed to accommodate increased output of
all these agricultural commodities.
The Irrigation Sub-Sector
2.04    Irrigation has so far played a fairly limited role in Burma's
agricultural development. Only 2.65 million acres, or 13% of the net cropped
area, receive some form of irrigation, and double-cropping is restricted to
about 0.4 million acres or 15% of the irrigated area. These ratios are among
the lowest in Asia. Most of the existing public irrigation schemes were
built at the beginning of this century on tributaries of the Irrawaddy to
provide assured water supply for a single main season rice crop. Government-
run diversion systems account for about 915,000 acres (35% of the total)
under irrigation, while private diversion schemes cover another 690,000 acres
(26Z). More recently, tanks and reservoirs (180,000 acres or 7%) and various
pumps and groundwater schemes (865,000 acres, or 32%), many of them privately
owned, have begun to play an increasingly important role in irrigation in
Burma.
2.05    Prospects for Irrigation.  While the past role of irrigation has been
limited, its potential for contributing to future increases in agricultural
production is substantial. Burma's rainfall pattern is highly seasonal, and
without irrigation, cropping intensities must remain low. In Lower Burma,
the cropping intensity currently reaches 130-140%, since cultivation on
residual moisture sometimes follows a full main season paddy crop. However,
in Upper Burma cropping intensity averages no more than 70-80%, since even
during the monsoon season, rainfall is often inadequate for a full crop.
Besides restricting crop areas, variable rainfall and poor water control also
result in water stress on growing crops (especially in Upper Burma) 4nd
flooding (in Lower Burma), with as much as 10% of the sown area often
destroyed.
2.06    Since only a small fraction of the water flowing in Burma's rivers is
currently tapped for irrigation, there is clearly major scope for increased
cropping during the dry season and for ensuring a full main season crop.
This can be achieved through the construction of new storage and diversion
structures, drainage and flood control facilities, and pumping schemes. In
addition, Burma's existing irrigation infrastructure, especially the large
systems constructed in Upper Burma at the beginning of this century, has
suffered serious physical deterioration owing to inadequate maintenance.
Howeverp through a program of rehabilitation, coupled with appropriate opera-
tion and maintenance (O&M) activities, the fuller potential of these existing
irrigation systems can be realized.

Covernment Agriculture Policy and IDA Lending Strategy
2.07    Government Policy.  The Government's main objectives in agriculture
have been to increase productivity and diversify production in order to
(1) raise farmers' incomes, (2) expand the country's export earnings,
(3) reduce agricultural imports, and (4) improve the competitive position
of Burma's rice exports. Both increased productivity and agricultural diver-
sification are closely linked to the development of the country's irrigation
potential and its efficient use. GOB is increas:ngly recognizing that
upgraded performance in irrigation requires not only technological develop-
ment and provision of inputs, but also strengthening of public agencies and
the formulation of policies conducive to producers' participation in agricul-
tural development initiatives.
2.08    In an effort to achieve GOB's objectives in irrigation, a number of
major new programs have been launched or are under consideration. These
include combined flood protection, land reclamation, and pump irrigation
programs in the Irrawaddy Delta; major storage-cum-irrigation projects on
principal tributaries of the Irrawaddy, Sittang, and Salween; tank projects
on smaller tributaries and rivers; pump schemes; run-of-the-river diversion
schemes; and groundwater projects.
2.09    IDA's Irrigation Development Objectives.  The World Bank's approach
to development of irrigation in Burma has generally been consonant with the
Government's sub-sectoral objectives. In particular, the Bank has
emphasized: (1) intensification of production, especially of paddy, on
existing cropland; (2) improvements in the quality of export paddy through
better milling and storage methods; and (3) diversification of irrigated
output. In addition, the Bank has sought to strengthen the principal
Government institutions involved in irrigation, including the Agricultural
Corporation (AC, responsible for research, extension, and input supply), the
Irrigation Department (ID, responsible for the construction, maintenance, and
operation of irrigation facilities), and the Agricultural Mechanization
Department (AMD). Given the increasingly important role these institutions
will have to play in Burma's agricultural development, the Bank has recog-
nized the need to help them build up their human, physical, and financial
resources.
2.10    IDA Lending for Irrigation.  IDA has been closely involved in recent
investments in the irrigation sub-sector. The first project approved after
IDA recommenced lending to Burma in 1973 (Cr. 483-BA, US$17 M) financed some
13,000 low-lift pumps for sale to farmers, as well as rehabilitation of minor
flood embankments in the delta area, equipment repair, and feasibility
studies. Lessons from this project (Project Performance Audit Report dated
June 14, 1982) include the following: (a) supervision c-ncenItrated on the
projects' engineering aspects, while agricultural development received
inadequate attention; (b) despite marked differences in farm size, full
account was not taken by authorities to safeguard the interests of small
farmers; (c) the project provided for large centralized workshops even though
experienced mechanics could be found in all villages; this led to under-
utilization of project facilities; and (d) an adequate monitoring and evalua-
tion system was not established. In designing the proposed project, due
attention has been paid to remedy similar shortcomings.



-5-
2.11    The first project was followed by two Paddyland projects (Cr. 642-BA,
US$30 M, and Cr. 835-BA, US$34.5 H), which are currently supporting flood
protection works in the delta area, together with pump irrigation and
agricultural extension activities. In 1980, IDA financed a multipurpose
hydropower and irrigation project on the Paunglaung river in Central Burma
(Nyaunggyat Dam, now renamed Kinda Dam, Cr. 1031-BA, US$90 M). The most
recently approved irrigation projects includle two tank irrigation schemes
(Cr. 1315-BA, US$19.0 M) and a groundwater project (Cr. 1381-BA, US$14.0 M).
An area development and pump irrigation project (Henzada) for which a
UNDP-financed feasibility study has been completed, and second groundwater
and tank irrigation projects are currently under consideration. A third
Paddylands project is also being prepared. In related areas, IDA has
approved two Grain Storage Projects (Cr. 1092-BA and Cr. 1707-BA) to help
overcome post-harvest constraints upon grain procurement and handling, and
two Seeds Development Projects (Cr. 745-BA and Cr. 1616-BA) aimed at meeting
the growing demand for quality HYV seeds.
2.12    The IDA's experience to date in the irrigation sub-sector has been
generally positive. Implementation of Paddylands I and Groundwater I was
delayed at the outset, due to lengthy procurement procedures. Since then,
however, procurement performance, although somewhat time-consuming, has been
satisfactory, and implementation of IDA-financed projects has improved.
Progress on the large-scale Kinda project has been slightly ahead of
schedule, while the Paddyland, Tank Irrigation, and Groundwater Projects have
experienced some delays, due to shortages of cement and diesel fuel, problems
in initial procurement, and slow appointment of consulcants.
III. YE-U PROJECT AREA AND IRRIGATION INSTITUTIONS
Ye-U Project Area
3.01    Location and Topography.  The project area, situated in the central
part of Sagaing Division in Upper Burma (see IBRD Map No. 18409), is the Ye-U
cowaand area of the Mu-Kabo irrigation system. It is located on the right
bank of the river Mu, an important tributary of the Irrawaddy River which it
joins to the south in its swing to the west below Mandalay. The river is
located entirely in Burma. The project area covers all or part of three
townships: Ye-U, Tabayin, and Ayadaw.
3.02    The topography is typical of a wide river flood plain.  The general
slope is from north to south, and varies from about 0.03% to 0.05%. The
project area elevation lies between 384 ft ASL and 270 ft ASL. To the west
of the Ye-U command area, the land rises more steeply and joins a range of
low incised hills about 20 miles distant. These drain towards the Ye-U Canal
and the project area.
3.03    Climate.  The area experiences a ."t season from May through October
and a pronounced dry season from December through March. November and April
are transitional. The annual average rainfall is 34 inches, 92% of which
falls in the wet season. Rainfall is highly variable (see Annex 1, Table 1)



-6-
between years and within years. The minimnm recorded annual rainfall is 21
inches.
3.04    The project area experiences a cool season from November through
February, during which mean temperatures range from 20 to 23 degrees C with
mean minima falling to 13 degrees C. This is followed by a hot dry season
from March through May, with mean temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C and
mean maxima above 37 degrees C. During the wet season from June through
October, temperatures to the upper 20 degrees C are moderated by humidity.
Relative humidity averages below 67% during February through April; there-
after, it rises to a peak of 85% from August through October.
3.05    Soils, Land Classification, and Groundwater.  The Ye-U command area
is situated predominantly on clays and clay loams of recent and pleistocenic
origin. The majority of the lands in the project area are good paddy lands,
but of very limited application to upland crops, due to their poor drainage
characteristics when wet and difficult tillage properties when dry. Soils
suited to upland crops are very limited, and occur mainly outside the command
area UIBRD Map No. 18706). A groundwater aquifer exists in the eastern
two-thirds of the project area at 100-300 ft depth. The option of conjunc-
tive use of ground and surface water was studied during project preparation,
but it was found that development of groundwater would not be economically
attractive.
3.06    Existing Irrigation Structures.  The Ye-U command area derives its
water supplies from the intake at Kabo weir. This structure across the Mu
river comprises four large sluice gates at the Shwebo intake on the left
bank, and two large sluice gates at the Ye-U intake on the right bank.
Between these, the 455 ft-long weir has 91 "falling shutters" to improve
diversion at low discharges. The Ye-U canal intake is controlled by three
19 ft wide rising sill gates. All are manually controlled. Intake capacity
is nominally 1,750 cubic feet per second (cusecs). No sediment control
devices exist.
3.07    The main canal system is as shown in the project area Map (IBRD No.
18409). The Ye-U Main Canal (YNC) is 44 mi in length, but at 14.6 mi a major
bifurcation structure diverts a part of the discharge into the Mayakan Branch
Canal (MBC) which is 18 mi in length. The main canals are wider than
originally designed, due possibly to erosion deriving from a change in sedi-
ment characteristics. The banks are in poor condition in places due to
erosion, and large deposits of sand exist on their beds. All of the struc-
tures along the main canals, including siphons, drop structures, and bridges,
are in various stages of disrepair. Some require only minor patchwork, while
others need complete reconstruction. Major deficiencies in the system are
the shortage of cross-regulators, lack of side-escapes, and the presence of
only one dilapidated tail escape.
3.08    Taking off from the main canals, there are 37 distributary (secon-
dary) and 5 minor (tertiary) canals, with a combined length of 150 mi. The
offtakes are simple wooden sluice gates, with no specific measuring devices.
There are 155 drop structures in the distributary canals to accommodate the
steeper cross-slopes in sections of the project area. There are also some 77



-7-
bridges. A further 22 minor canals with a total length of 35 mi derive
conventionally from the distributaries.
3.09    All of these Ye-U irrigation facilities have deteriorated con-
siderably since 1940, due to neglect during the wartime years, political
changes in the post-war era, and finally, inadequacy f O&M funds - a situa-
tion still prevailing today. At present, the main distributary and minor
canals contain large deposits of sand and silt that have accumulated over
many years. Maior components such as cross-drainage structires, bridges, and
distributary offtakes are dilapidated.  Water control at the farmers' water-
courses is crude, due to primitive and often damaged offtakes. Flooding has
taken large areas out of command.
3.10    In addition to those items that have deteriorated due to neglect, it
is apparent that the Ye-U System is lacking in certain hydraulic components
necessary for more efficient water control. These include a sediment ejector
and silt trap at the intake, cross-regulation structures, side and tail
escapes, measuring devices, and responsive offtake structures at minor canal
and watercourse levels. Communications are very tenuous, especially in the
wet season, due to lack of all-weather surfaced inspection roads and
telephone or radio systems.
3.11    Two major drains evacuate rainfall, surface run-off from irrigation,
and cross-drainage flows outside the project area. These are the Payanpaga
Chaung stream to the west, and the Moksi Chaung to the east. Cross-drainage
flows, arising from runoff in the hills to the west, cross the Ye-U Main
Canal through 27 siphons and 2 superpasses. Due to impeded drainage in the
main Payanpaga and Moksi Chaungs and to neglect in the feeder drains, con-
siderable overland flooding occurs each year during the wet season. This is
responsible for some 15,200 ac of previously irrigated paddyland becoming
fallow and unproductive.
3.12    System Operation.  The YMC is opened on May 15 e-ch year following
maintenance to the system, and normally operates until mid- or end-November.
During periods of adequate river flow, the whole irrigation system operates
on full flow, with farmers taking their water requirements in excess of
rainfall. The absence of side or tail emergency escapes means that if sudden
heavy rainfall occurs when the main canal is running full, the only way in
which surplus water may be dissipated before the main canal closure takes
effect is by farmers passing it over their land to the drains. This may be
exacerbating the flooding problems referred to above (para 3.11).
3.13    At periods of low flow in the Mu River when irrigation is required,
it is current practice for the total river flow (less headworks leakage) to
be diverted alternately to the Shwebo and the Ye-U canals on a six-day cycle.
Within the Ye-U Division, water is then rotated between the YMC and the MBC
on a 4:2 and 2:4 day cycle. In this way, uoe attempt is made to provide
adequate flow in the sections of the main distribution system to give optimum
offtake discharge in the distributaries. This is not possible hydraulically
with only two cross-regulators, and consequently the system is inefficient
under these conditions.



-8-
3.14    Project Area Population.  Census information for 1981-82, the latest
available, indicates that t,-.e total population of the three townships in
which the Ye-U command area is located (Ye-U, Tabayin, and Ayadaw) is about
323,000 (Table 3.1). Approximately 93Z of the population are rural; Ye-U
town, with 7,600 inhabitants, is the only significant urban center in the
area. A socioeconomic survey carried out during project preparation revealed
that 127,239 persons, or 39% of the population of the three townships, live
within the command area and are, thus, expected to be affected directly by
the irrigation rehabilitation. The largest number of direct beneficiaries
resides in Tabayin (66% of township total), followed by Ye-U and Ayadaw. A
total of 197 villages are located in the command area, with an average of 646
persons per village. Average household size is estimated to be about 6
persons.

3.15    Land Tenure and Farm Distribution.  Legally speaking, individual
ownership of land is not permitted in Burma, except for plantation land
growing tree crops. Land is vested in the state, which allocates it to
farmers for their use. Tenancy and sharecropping are also prohibited. In
practice, however, the government rarely contests an individual farmer's
right to use land passed on to him through inheritance or other local trans-
actions, so that in many respects the farmer's rights are tantamount to
private ownership and he enjoys adequate security of tenure to make long-term
investments in his farm. Officially, the Village Land Committee (VLC)
assigns land use rights to individuals, who are expected to participate in
the production program of the village. Failing this, or if a farmer leaves
his land uncultivated for two successive years, cultivation rights can in
theory be taken away from him by the VLC.
3.16    In the project area, which includes both irrigated and rainfed (where
irrigation water supplies are inadequate) paddy, the average farm size is 6
acres. About 24% of the area is in holdings of less than 5 acres, 42% in
holdings of 5-10 acres, and 34% in holdings of more than 10 acres (Table
3.2). In addition, the average farmer in the project area has about two
acres of uplands for the cultivation of oilseeds, pulses, and vegetables.

3.17    Present Agricultural Situation.  The project area currently comprises
the following three categories of paddylands:
-  Irrigated                             96,400 ac
-  Rainfed/periodically irrigated         9,500 ac
-  Flooded (fallow)                      15,200 ac
Total Con-and Area         121,100 ac
The irrigated paddy area (or planted area) in the past 10 years has ranged
from 89,600 to 101,100 ac, with an average of 96,400 ac. Of this amount,
however, the harvested area has averaged only about 92,200 ac (95% of the
planted area), due mainly to insufficient water supply after transplanting.
3.18    Following the monsoon paddy harvest, about 16,000 ac of the paddy
area is estimated to be planted, mainly with chickpea grown on residual soil
moisture. The cropp,ng intensity on the presently cultivated paddyland is
estimated at about 115%; including the flooded land which is potentially
cultivable, the overall intensity is only about 105%. More than 90% of the
cultivaed paddyland is transplanted with high-yielding varieties. Applica-
tion of chemical fertilizers is widely practiced by farmers in the area
(about 80-90 lb/ac of urea and about 30 lb/ac of TSP). The existing cropping
pattern and yields, together with those projected with and without project,
are summarized in Annex 1, Table 2.
3.19    Some of the major constraints to increasing paddy production in the
project area include (a) lack of flood control, drainage and irrigation on
about 15,200 ac of fallow lands; (b) inadequate distribution system to
deliver irrigation water to the tail-end command area of about 9,500 ac;
(c) fluctuating and unreliable water supply with periodic shortages, which in
turn discourage farmers from applying greater doses of inputs.
3.20    Present Farm Income Levels.  Present farm income levels for
households located within the Ye-U command area are shown in Table 3.3.
They indicate that for the average family, current farm income is K 9,342
(US$1,153) or about K 1,557 (US$192) per capita. For the majority of



-10-
households with less than five acres of cultivated land, however, average
farm income is only K 4,515 (US$557) or K 986 (US$85) per capita. Since
households in the command area earn little off-farm income -- the only sig-
nificant source being tea-plucking in the Shan Hills during the dry season,
these figures suggest that the vast majority of farmers in the project area
receive less than Burma's national per capita income, estimated at US$190. A
large number of project beneficiaries can, therefore, be considered as living
below the poverty line.

Total             100.0          9,342       1,153
3.21    Input Supply and Storage Facilities.  Fertilizers are distributed
and sold to farmers by the Agricultural Corporation (AC) at highly subsidized
and uniform prices. Farmers or village tract cooperatives handle transport
from distribution points, usually township or production camp godowns
(warehouses). Demand for fertilizer invariabLy exceeds the supply, and
therefore a rationing system is currently operating with priority usually
given government- controlled and internationally traded crops. Total
capacity of existing AC fertilizer godowns in the three project townships is
about 5,400 tons. This capacity is inadequate when compared to the current
annual turnover of 6,500 tons of seeds and fertilizer in the Ye-U command
area, and is well below the forecasted turnover of 12,500 tons under the
proposed project.
3.22    Marketing.  The Government purchases paddy directly from farmers or
cooperatives through the Agricultural and Farm Products Trade Corporation
(AFPTC) procurement centers at a fixed price for subsequent sale to consumer
cooperatives and government stores, and for export. Paddy procurement,
milling, and rice distribution have been under Government control since 1964.
In 1973, a compulsory quota system was established under which production in
excess of estimated farm family requirements is procured by AFPTC. Quotas
are fixed using estimates of sown acreage and yields, with allowances made
for seeds, family consumption, and other on-farm requirements. These
allowances are currently as follows:
- Seeds - 1.5 baskets/ac (69 lb/ac)
- Family consumption - 13.5 baskets/person (621 lb/person)
- Hired labor - actual cost in paddy equivalent



-11-
Quotas are fixed on a seasonal basis for each farm in the township and for
the township as a whole. Sanctions are applied so that few farmers fail to
meet their quota requirements. Farmers are allowed to trade any surplus
production, although this practice is not backed by any legislation. Total
paddy procured by the Government nationwide in 1981/85 is estimated at about
4.1 H tons, or about 30Z of total paddy production.
3.23    A notice from the Ministry of Trade is issued each year announcing
the procurement quota of paddy. The procurement season starts in November
and continues up to July/August. To effect procurement, AFPTC maintains a
network of about 800 buying depots, of which 20 are in the project area.
Total paddy procured in the three townships included in the project areas,
amounted in 1981/82 to 2.6 million baskets or 53,400 tons. Farmers are paid
in cash on consignment, minus repayment for short-term credit.
3.24    Total paddy production in the three townships of Ye-U, Tabayin, and
Ayadaw amounts at present to about 8.6 M baskets (177,000 tons). It is
estimated that about 4.2 M baskets or 49Z of production is used for food
consumption. The rest is traded, about 30% through AFPTC and 20% on the
open market. It appears that at present only Ayadaw township is not self-
sufficient in paddy, which means that a large proportion of the project
production would be consumed outside the project area but within the Sagaing
Division.
3.25 - Storage. In the project area, the paddy procured by AFPTC is stored
in about 45 godowns with an estimated capacity of about 950,000 baskets
(19,500 tons). The shortage of storage capacity is made up by constructing
temporary facilities from bamboo and thatch (Nipa leaves), which provide only
limited protection for the paddy during the wet season.
3.26    Millin .  The total milling capacity in the project area amounts to
about 267 tons 8 hours for 29 mills, distributed as follows:
Total Capacity
Township        No. of Mills          (Baskets/8 Hours)
Ye-U                  13                     5,882
Tabayin               12                     6,750
Ayadaw                 4                       392
Total          29                     13,024
Private mills have contracts to process paddy for AFPTC and are also allowed
to mill for private persons, approximately in the ratio 70:30. Milling rates
vary from 34 to 38 Kyat/100 baskets for AFPTC and 100 Kyat/1O0 baskets for
private persons.
3.27    Communications.  Communications to the Ye-U project area are poor,
with only one all-weather access road from Monywa, some 50 miles from Ye-U
town. All other roads are unsurfaced, and are mainly impassable during the
monsoon season. The inspection tracks of the irrigation system are also
unsurfaced and are generally in poor condition. The railway from Mandalay



-12-
serves both Monywa and Shwebo on the opposite bank of the Mu River. Before
World War II, it connected Monywa and Ye-U, but during the war years this
section was removed and has not been replaced. Movement within the project
area is by dirt roads that are passabLe only during the dry season. The
national electricity grid has not yet been extended to the area, and
diesel-powered generators provide power for minimal lighting in Ye-U and
Tabayin towns. The only national telephone exchange in the project area is
at Ye-U, but the exchange will be extended to Tabayin town during 1985.
3.28    Social Infrastructure.  As elsewhere in Burma, medical services are
provided to the rural population through a network of township and
sub-township hospitals as well as regional health centers. In the project
area, each of the three townships has two hospitals and 4-6 health centers.
Nationwide primary school enrollment is believed to be around 34%. Although
no exact figures are available, this percentage is probably somewhat lower in
the project area.
The Institutional Setting for Irrigation
3.29    Irrigation Department.  In projects involving drainage, flood control
and irrigation, the Irrigation Department (ID) under the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Forests (MAF) is the lead agency. It comprises 14 maintenance and
construction circles, eight project construction entities, and two support
circles of Planning and Design and Mechanical Equipment (Annex 5, Chart
1(a)). In addition to its role in the planning, design, construction and O&M
of irrigation projects, ID is also responsible for the dredger fleet that
maintains the navigability of ports and waterways. Although close liaison is
maintained with the Agriculture Corporation (AC) in the planning of water
control projects, the Planning and Design Circle of ID has .ts own specialist
staff for soil surveys, topographic surveys and geology. Hydrology and
groundwater are the responsibility of two specialized subdivisions. A
reorganization of ID is currently being considered by GOB. The proposed new
organization would retain the 14 existing maintenance and construction
circles, but the eight existing project entities would be abolished. Ten new
circles would be added, including: (a) investigation. geological and
hydrological circles; (b) four construction circles; and (c) three mechanical
circles (Annex 5, Chart 1(b)).
3.30    Ye-U Command.  ID controls the irrigation water distribution system
from the Kabo Weir to the watercourse offtakes.  Within the Ye-U command area
on the right side of the weir, water distribution is handled by two subdivi-
sions of the larger Ye-U Irrigation Division; each subdivision is controlled
by an Assistant Engineer (AE). A comprehensive staff of canal inspectors,
canal revenue surveyors and their assistants, and gate operators provides
operational support. The head regulator at Kabo Weir is operated by an AE
from Shwebo Division, but good communications and liaison exists between him
and the Executive Engineer (EE) of Ye-U Division.
3.31    The watercourses are controlled by farmers' groups under the Village
Peasants' Councils. Each group has a manager, elected by his fellow farmers,
who is responsible for overseeing the operation and maintenance of his
watercourse unit. In times of shortage, rotation within the watercourse is
practiced. Supply is generally by field ditches and not plot-to-plot. As



-13-
long as water is supplied to the watercourses in a timely way during rotation
in the system, it is equitably distributed in the majority of cases.
3.32    Mechanical Circle.  All mechanical engineering services for irriga-
tion works in the ID are provided by the Mechanical Circle, headed by a
Deputy Director (Mechanical). The Circle comprises a headquarters complex,
base workshop, and stores sub-division in Rangoon; and regional workshops in
Mandalay, Meiktila, and Prome. To provide efficient services to construction
and maintenance activities, facilities and support staff are also provided in
seven major construction projects (Kinda, Ngaleik, Sedawgyi, Paddylands I,
Paddylands II, Groundwater I, and Medium Tanks I).
3.33    The regional workshops and base workshop perform the following roles:
(a) storage of spare parts, fuel, oil and lubricants; (b) engine and chassis
repair and overhaul of motor transport and light equipment; and (c) produc-
tion of minor components, including simple gates and fabricated steel work
for irrigation and drainage structures. Each regional workshop includes a
mechanical operating division that carries out mechanical works for the
affiliated construction and civil works maintenance divisions. These divi-
sions are provided with small construction equipment and motor transport.
The regional workshop nearest the project area is located in Mandalay.
3.34    The staffing of the Mechanical Circle and of the mechanical divisions
from construction projects is as follows:
Mechanical   Mechanical
Circle     Divisions     Total
Engineering Group                        75          93           168
Office Group (accounts, clerks)          80           53          133
Technical Group (superintendents,
supervisors, operators,
mechanics, tradesmen)               1,374       1,089         2,463
Totals           1,529        1,235        2,764
These figures reflect serious shortages, especially in the professional,
supervisory, and artisan categories. The senior and middle managerial staff
of the Mechanical Circle are technically competent, but lack formal manage-
ment training. At lower managerial levels, and in the case of operators and
mechanics, the quality of staff is highly variable. The only training center
is at Rangoon, and although courses are held regularly, the number of fully
trained operators and mechanics is limited.
3.35    All the ID's mechanical workshops are seriously lacking in installed
equipment such as overhead cranes, special tools, and hand tools. Although
there are large numbers of machine tools, such as lathes, most of them are
not operational due to lack of spare parts and cutting tools. The buildings
at most of the workshops are in satisfactory condition, except the regional
workshops at Rangoon and Prome, which only have earth floors and makeshift
wooden construction. The installed supporting services at the four mechani-
cal compounds are inadequate: electric power, water supply, fuel storage and



-14-
dispensing facilities, fire fighting equipment, and equipment cleaning
facilities need either to be installed or improved in these compounds.
3.36    The Mechanical Circle also suffers from the lack of a management
information system to establish programs for equipment and spare parts inven-
tories, equipment scrapping, overhaul, and purchase of new items. As a
result, equipment is not always optimally reallocated to new projects after
earlier ones are completed; some equipment assigned to specific activities
tends to be underutilized due to spare parts shortages; and other equipment
items that have become obsolete and unserviceable are retained by the ID,
instead of being disposed through a positive scrapping program.
3.37    Current operation and repair procedures tend to reduce efficiencies
of equipment utilization. There are no plant cards or log books on which to
record operating hours, fuel and lubricant use, repairs, overhauls, and spare
parts consumed. Fuel supply to job sites is by barrels, increas:ng the
chances of dirt contamination. Since oil quality in Burma is below normal
standards, high engine wear results. Equipment generally operates on site
until a breakdown occurs, with few attempts by operators or supervisors to
diagnose faults and correct them. Following a breakdown, most field repairs
are carried out under primitive conditions on dirt floors with little
protection from the weather. If spares are not available, the equipment is
immobile until repaired or cannibalized. The base and regional workshops are
utilized mainly to repair and sverhaul machines that have been brought into
the compounds at the end of maintenance or construction jobs, and not, as
should be the case, for all but minor field repairs. Due to inadequate hand
tools and lack of specialized knowledge of equipment, repairs are often of
inferior standard, leading to early failure of associated parts and requiring
additional repairs.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.38    The Agriculture Corporation (AC) of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forests (MAF) is responsible for agricultural extension and research, coor-
dination of fertilizer and agricultural chemical distribution, and seed
multiplication and distribution. Within AC, two research divisions are
operative--the Applied Research Division (ARD) at Cyogon (Rangoon) and the
Agricultural Research Institute at Yezin. ARD administers 24 seed farms and
18 central experimental stations throughout the country. The central farms
ore respon3ible for plant breeding, crop selection, yield testing, cultural
and fertilizer experiments, and extension manager training. The nearest
research station to the project area is Mandalay Central Farm, located about
70 miles southeast of Ye-U town. At Zaloke, about 50 miles south of Ye-U,
there is a wheat seed farm, assisted by an FAO Crop Development Project. It
is considered that existing paddy cultivation technol'ogy that has already
emerged from national research is sufficient to provide support to the
project farmers.
3.39    AC's Extensicn Division, also headquartered in Rangoon, has respon-
sibility for implementing agricultural production plans, procuring and
distributing agricultural supplies, and disseminating research information to
farmers. The farm-level extension worker, called a Village Extension Manager
(VEM), is supervised by a Vi'llage Tract Extension Manager (VTEM), who in turn



-15-
reports to a Township Manager. The township-level staff is supported by
officers at divisional and national levels.
3.40    The integrated package of inputs and services known as the Whole
Township Expansion Program (WTEP) has been in operation in Ye-U and Tabayin
since 1978, and has contributed to higher paddy yields. Ayadaw (accounting
for about 10% of the project area) is not yet covered by the WTEP. A typical
program has the following components: (a) establishment of a special commit-
tee to promote the program at township level; (b) increased staffing,
particularly at the Deputy Township Manager and VEM level; (c) distribution
of HYV seed, and increased provision of fertilizers and chemicals;
(d) promotion of a set of improved agricultural practices through intensified
contacts between different levels of the staff and between VEMs and vil-
lagers; and (e) mass mobilization at periods of maximum labor use (harvest-
ing, transplanting). The central focus for a program covering 10-15 village
tracts is the HYV production camp. There are 5-7 such camps in a township.
The VTEMs and VEMs live together at the production camp, which is also the
center for publicity, training sessions, and input distribution.
3.41    AC currently has a total of 67 staff in the three townships.  The
average ratio of VEMs to farm families is approximately 1:940. The current
staffing ratio of Village Tract Extension Managers (VTEM) to VEMs is 1:5.
There are no subject matter specialists (SMS) at township level.
3.42    The Myanma Agricultural Bank (MAB), the official source of agricul-
tural credit, was established in 1976 to provide seasonal loans to farmers
through township banks. The current interest rate charged to farmers is 12%
for seasonal and longer term loans. At present, 29 crops are eligible for
MAB loans, the main ones being paddy (82Z of the total) and oilseeds. Term
loans are made to assist farmers in the purchase of bullocks and pumps.
Farmers supplement credit available from MAB by forward sales of crops to
cooperatives and the Textile Industry Corporation. In 1983, MAB advanced
a total of K 18.2 million to farmers in the three townships covered by the
project. Loan recovery rates in recent years have been above 90%.
3.43    The Agriculture and Farm Products Trade Corporation (AFPTC), under
the Ministry of Trade, is responsible for implementing GOB's policies and
programs for crop procurement, processing, transportation and storage (para
3.22). It also handles exports of agricultural produce for the Myanma
Export/Import Corporation. At present, one of AFPTC's most serious weak-
nesses is the lack of covered storage at paddy purchasing centers, which
combined with the aging private enterprise rice mills, yields milled rice of
a high percentage of brokens, thus curtailing export values. To correct
this, AFPTC is currently involved in the construction of improved storage and
mills with assistance from IDA, the Asian Development Bank, and bilateral
donors.
3.44    The Ministry of Cooperatives overseas the Central Cooperative
Society's Council, which controls and supervises the Township Cooperative
Societies. These, in turn, organize and supervise the four major types of
primary cooperatives: consumer, village, producer, and savings/credit.
Producer cooperatives are most relevant for agriculture. Their farmer
members are able to purchase equipment with MAB credit, and through the



-16-
cooperatives, landless families are settled on reclaimed land. The coopera-
tive system is still in the process of evolution, and GOB is placing strong
emphasis on its development. A number of cooperatives are registered in the
project area, but less than 1Z of the land is actually cultivated on a
cooperative basis.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01    Rationale for IDA's Involvement in the Project.  While in recent
years, Burma has allocated significant resources to new irrigation invest-
ments, it has also increasingly recognized the importance of returning exist-
ing deteriorated schemes to their former operational efficiency and covering
fully commanded areas. In its dialogue with the Government, IDA has been
taking the lead in encouraging GOB to undertake such rehabilitation works.
The proposed project would not only be Burma's first major venture in irriga-
tion rehabilitation, it would inaugurate a program for rehabilitation over
the next two decades that would eventually cover at least five large schemes
in the country's dry zone with a combined area of 500,000 acres. Given
Burma's current financial resource constraints, rehabilitation is a highly
attractive area of investment, since water distribution system limitations
and flooding problems can be rapidly resolved using a known, low-cost tech-
nology, and farm production can continue uninterrupted during the construc-
tion period. Since IDA has been the leading source of financial assistance
and policy advice to Burma in irrigation over the past decade, and has been
the chief advocate of rehabilitation among the external donors, it is par-
ticularly well-positioned to initiate this important rehabilitation program.
IDA has evolved a close working relationship with ID, which has resulted in
policy breakthrough in areas such as ICB practices, recovery of electricity
costs in groundwater irrigation pumping, increased use of critically-required
external consultants, and, to a limited extent, monitoring and evaluation of
agricultural projects. Through the proposed project, IDA would continue to
achieve significant reforms by building up ID's long-range planning and
project preparation functions, and by creating an institutional capacity for
managing efficiently ID's large and expanding fleet of costly heavy equipment
and vehicles.
Project Objectives
4.02    The main objectives of the project are:
(a) to raise the incomes and improve the living standards of farmers
located within the Ye-U comnand area, by enhancing water delivery
through rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure
and strengthening of the Agricultural Corporation's (AC) extension
and input supply services;
(b) to strengthen the Irrigation Department's (ID) overall capacity to
plan and carry out the modernization, rehabilitation, and maintenance
of Burma's irrigation infrastructure, through the elaboration of a
Master Plan for the rehabilitation of at least five major schemes;
and



-17-
(c) to create within ID's Mechanical Branch a capacity for the full and
effective management of ID's fleet of heavy equipment, and also to
undertake the overhaul of a portion of the fleet for use in
implementing this Master Plan and other irrigation projects.

Detailed Features
Irrigation Civil Works (Base Cost US$6.18 M)
4.04    Rehabilitation (Base Cost US$2.77 M, Annex 2, Table 2).  The project
would provide for:
(a) General repairs to the masonry, gates, and downstream erosion protec-
tion works of the intake structure for Ye-U Main Canal at [abo Weir;
(b) Excavation of the Ye-U Main Canal (YMC) and the Mayagan Branch Canal
(MBC) (926,000 cu yd) and resectioning to design specifications. For
portions where serious erosion has occurred, siltation spurs would be
installed to prevent further erosion by inducing siltation to reduce
excessive width of the canals;



-*19-
(c) Excavation and resectioning of distributary and minor canals using
manual methods. This would involve earthworks of 107,800 cu yd.
Embankment for the minor canals would also be raised and graded to
the design configuration, involving about 16,500 cu yd of earthworks;
(d) Minor repairs to the bifurcation structure at which YMC and MBC
separate, and improved scour protection in both canals;
(e) Repairs to the 29 cross-drainage structures (i.e., two superpassages
and 27 siphons) on the YMC headreach and tail distributary, and
erosion protection works in the canal and cross-drains. Embankment
height would be increased to prevent overtopping and breaching during
peak floods. This would provide more hydraulic head for additional
discharge capacity of the cross-drainage structures, even though the
past experience during more than 60 years of operation indicates that
the capacity of these structures is adequate. An additional
cross-drainage structure, however, would be provided on the MBC
(para 4.05 (c));
(f) Repairs to the nine drop-structures on the NBC, together with
strengthening of the drop walls, improvements to stilling basins, and
erosion control works. Additional freeboard would be provided by
raising the wingwalls and embankments as necessary. Foot-bridges
would be replaced;
Cg)  Repairs to the 155 drop-structures on the distributary and minor
canals, covering wing walls, abutments, and stilling basins. Some 77
small bridges over these canals would also be repaired as required;
Ch) Refurbishing of 37 traffic-bridges and 10 foot-bridges over the main
canals, with work varying from minor patchwork and erosion control to
total rebuilding;
Ci) Minor structural repairs to 30 of the 42 head regulators, plus
rebuilding of the balance of 12 regulators; and
(j) Reclamation of some 15,200 ac of previously irrigable lands, now
abandoned due to flooding.- The flooding is causzd by siltation of
two major drainage channels, which backs up storm runoffs and causes
discharges to overflow the banks. The two drainage channels and
branches in the project area would be straightened and resectioned,
requiring 2.5 million cu yd of earthwork. New drains (about 1.0
million cu yd earthwork) _uuld be excavated. Embankments (total
earthwork of 0.6 million cu yd) would be constructed.
4.05    System Modernization (Base Cost US$1.64 M, Annex 2, Table 3).  The
project would provide for:
(a) Construction of a sediment ejector at Kabo Weir, in front of the
intake for the YMC. The ejector would comprise 16 reinforced con-
crete barrels of a 3 ft by 3 ft section, set on the existing upstream
floor of the right bank sand sluice;



-20-
(b) Building a silt trap in the headreach of the YMC, just downstream
from the intake structure, by widening and deepening of a 2,000 ft.
portion of the main canal to permit sedimentation of heavier material
entering the system. Two 1.5 cu yd-draglines and four 3.5 cu yd-dump
trucks would be provided to remove and transport the sediment. An
operation bridge and access road would be provided;
(c) Remodelling of one existing cross-regulator in the YMC, using a
combination of drop boards (movable overflow weirs) and undershot
gates to provide improved hydraulic performance and pass sediment
downstream. Ten new cross-regulators having similar design charac-
teristics would be installed in the YMC. In addition to the
modification of 29 existing cross-drainage structures, an "Irish
Crossing" cross-drainage structure would be constructed on the MBC to
allow overflow into an existing depression;
(d) Improvements to six escapes, to permit the safe removal of surplus
discharges in the main canal system. Six of these would be in the
YMC, using the existing cross-drainage superpassages (SP2 and SP4,
IBRD Map No. 18409) and siphons (5B, 6A, 9 and 13, IBRD Map No.
18409);
(e) Construction of tail escapes in both the YMC and MBC. In the former,
a rudimentary escape exists at siphon 16 (S16, IBRD Map No. 18409),
but would require complete remodelling and new gates. In the NBC, a
new structure would be needed. To facilitate the MBC's discharge
into the Pyanpaga Chaung, a 4,400 ft-escape channel and structures
would be constructed;
(f) Installation of measuring devices, Parshall flume or similar, in each
canal just downstream from the turnout structure. A suitable device
would also be provided for measuring the discharge in the MBC near
the bifurcation;
(g) Building of new intake structures at heads of minor canals taking off
conventionally from the distributaries. Proportional flow division
structures would be utilized, of which eight would have discharges
above 10 cusec;
(h) Building of protection works on the right bank of the Mu River near
Distributary 13, in order to check further bank erosion that might
endanger the distributary canal;
(i) Installation of 1,615 open-flume type intakes of reinforced concrete
and brick construction;
(j) Repairs to the collapsed major road bridge at Poktadaw village, about
150 ft long and with three spans;
(k) Improvements to the main and subsidiary maintenance and inspection
roads and tracks along the major canal embankment, and between the
tails of the YMC and MBC, to permit inspection, supervisory control,
and emergency maintenance in the wet season. Some 9.1 miles would be



-21-
enhanced with a 10 ft-wide, 10 in-thick gravel surface, while a
further 59.2 miles would have an eight ft-wide, six in-thick gravel
surface; and
(1) In order to exercise operational control over the constituent sub-
divisions for better water control and thus higher utilization
efficiency, installation of a telephone system comprising a basic
exchange at divisional headquarters at Ye-U, plus six stations at
sub-divisional level. Some 51 miles of overhead line would connect
these stations.
4.06    Irrigation Operation and Maintenance (0&H) (Base Cost US$0.96 H
Annex 2, Table 4). Over the past five years, ID has provided annually about
K 2.0 M for the system maintenance element of the O&M budget for Ye-U, or
K 20/ac (based on the net commanded area of 101,000 ac). Since these funds
have been insufficient, the project would provide for incremental O&M in
order to bring the totaL for maintenance of civil works to about K 32/ac or
K 3.88 M a year for the net area of 121,100 ac under rehabilitation. In
addition, the other important headings for recurrent exptnditure at Ye-U,
such as salaries (currently about K 0.6 million), travel (K 0.15 million),
building maintenance (K 0.12 million), vehicle maintenance (K 0.15 million),
the cost of removing the sand bar upstream from the Ye-U intake (K 0.5 mil-
lion a year) and repair to Kabo Weir (K 2.0 million a year), would also be
maintained in the future at least at their current levels in real terms.
Thus, total O&M expenditure for the Ye-U system would rise from K 5.5 to
about K 7.4 million (K 61/ac) a year. To sustain mechanized O&M operations,
two draglines, one grader, four 3.5 cu yd tipper trucks, and construction
equipment items would be transferred to ID's civil works division following
construction. Most of the transport items would also be passed on to the
O&M establishment. Many of the buildings would remain, to be used for O&H.
Assurances have been obtained from the GOB that it would provide these finan-
cial and other resources in a timely manner, in order to meet the revised O&M
needs of the Ye-U System; that GOB would review annually with IDA its budget
allocation for O&M of Ye-U; and based on this annual review, COB would adjust
its O&M allocations accordingly to ensure adequate O&M.
4.07    On-Farm Development (Base Cost US$0.81 M, Annex 2, Table 5).  The
number of watercourses would be increased to about 1,615 and measuring
devices (open-flume type) would be provided just downstream from the intakes
from the minors. Under this arrangement, an average watercourse would supply
about 75 ac. Watercourses would be manually excavated and resectioned where
necessary, the total earthworks volume involved being about 388,000 cu yd.
Since most watercourses are constructed in heavy-textured soils and have been
in service for more than 60 years without any evidence of excessive seepage,
lining of these watercourses would not be necessary. As most of the project
area has been under irrigated cultivation for about 70 years, farmlands
appear to be reasonably well levelled, and additional land-levelling would
not appear justified. Land-levelling experiments conducted recently in the
ADB-financed Sedawgyi Project show no significant improvements in yields.



-22-
Watercourse remodelling and realignment would be the reeionsibility of the
existing farmers' groups, 1/ assisted by ID technical -,ersonnel.
Earthmoving Equipment (Base Cost US*5.42 M, Annex 2, Table 6)
4.08    Equipment with adequate spare parts for the construction period would
be procured. Due to the uncertain completion schedule of on-going irrigation
projects and current problems related to equipment maintenance, the only used
items that are expected to be available for inclusion in the project would be
three Class II scrapers and one wheel dozer.
Construction Supervision (Base Cost US$2.83 H)
4.09    Camps and Offices (Base Cost US$0.71 M, Annex 2, TabLe 7).  Addi-
tional semi-permanent and temporary buildings would be constructed in the
Ye-U divisional compound to house a Construction Division, Design Division,
and Mechanical Division. New accommodations would be built in Tabayin for a
second Construction Division.
4.10    Vehicles and Equipment (Base Cost US$0.57 H, Annex 2, Table 8).  An
equipped project workshop would be established at Ye-U.  Office and engineer-
ing equipment would also be included. In addition, the ID divisions would be
provided with eight four-wheel drive vehicles, two trucks, and ten motor-
cycles.
4.11    Engineering and Administration (Base Cost US$1.54 M, Annex 2,
Table 9). The Project Director, of Superintending Engineer (SE) level, would
be located in Rangoon with a small staff. The current Executive Engineer
CEE) position that oversees Ye-U Division O&M, together with all staff, would
be absorbed into the construction organization. In total, the incremental
personnel would consist of some 54 professional staff (SE, EE, AE and SAE),
57 technical staff (supervisors, foremen, draftsmen), and 390 clerical,
logistics staff and labor.
Institutional Strengthening (Base Cost, US$1.79 H)
4.12    Agriculture Corporation (Base Cost US$0.42 M, Annex 2, Table 10).
The project would provide for (a) construction of three HYV production camps
(farmers' training and extension centers) and two fertilizer godowns; (b)
purchase of four 4-wheel drive vehicles, 19 motorcycles, and 93 bicycles; (c)
weighing scales and fire-fighting equipment for godowns; (d) 288 man-years of
additional staff; and (e) four man-years of overseas training.
1! The Village Tract People's Council and the Peasant's Asiayone, in
collaboration with Burma Socialist Program Party (BSAP) and AC, provide
an important forum for the expression of farmers' views on water-sharing
and local participation in maintenance of the irrigation system. These
farmer groups are also used by GOB agencies for purposes of extension,
input distribution, and crop procurement.



-23-
4.13    ID Civil Engineering (Base Cost US$0.54 M, Annex 2, Table 11).  Most
of the irrigation rehabilitation activities are of a straightforward
engineering nature, and would be handled by ID staff. However, more special-
ized technical assistance and equipment would have to be provided in three
6reas: (a) the testing of a sediment ejector model and design of a silt trap
in the main canal to minimize siltation (8 man-months of TA); (b) the estab-
lishment of new procedures for operation of the Ye-U irrigation system in
order to improve water use efficiency (4 man-months); and (c) the elaboration
of a long-term master plan for irrigation rehabilitation and preparation of a
follow-on project (18 man-months). The detailed Terms of Reference are given
in Annex 3, parts 1-3.
4.14    ID Mechanical Engineering (Base Cost US$0.83 M, Annex 2, Table 12).
A technical assistance team comprising a mechanical engineer and three
specialists (equipment operations, equipment workshop and service, stores and
spare parts - total of 81 man-months) would be provided under the project, to
advise and assist the Deputy Director of Mechanical Branch in the implementa-
tion of the other mechanical components of this project (paras 4.15-4.16).
They would seek to improve the overall management of the ID vehicle and
equipment fleet, by increasing the availability and utilization of units
through improved preventive maintenance and better operation. The technical
assistance team would further establish on-the-job training courses to
upgrade the skills of the existing ID mechanical staff. They would assist in
the assessment of ID's equipment needs and help to prepare a detailed
four-year equipment overhaul, scrapping, and replacement program. They would
also establish a central stock control system for the RangGon Workshop,
catering to the transfer of stocks from project to project and the iden-
tification of ID inventory stock at any given time.  This inventory control
would determine maximum and minimum stocks of fast-moving preventive main-
tenance spares for each project, and would avoid the over-purchase of stocks
of spares not normally be required in the first two years of new equipment
utilization. The project would provide a micro-computer to assist in Lhis
inventory control. The detailed Terms of Reference are given in Annex 3,
Parts 4-5.
Mechanical Circle (Base Cost US$3.00 M)
4.15    Mechanical Branch Services (Base Cost US$1.41 M, Annex 2, Table 13).
The project would provide improved facilities for workshops carrying out
preventive maintenance of machinery and construction equipment, to ensure
that the machines are operated and serviced in accordance with manufacturers'
instructions. The following items would be included: six skid-mounted field
service units; a hydraulic components workshop in Rangoon with services and
equipment; essential workshop tools and equipment; mobile workshop cranes and
forklift trucks; and improvements to the Okkyin dredger base and to the
Rangoon workshop water supply system.
4.16    Spare Parts for Equipment Rehabilitation (Base Cost US$1.59 M,
Annex 2, Table 14). The project has been designed to initiate an ID program
for rehabilitating existing equipment instead of the continuous procurement
of new units. A program for overhauling units suitable for use in future
projects up to 1990 would be drawn up by identifying the specific units
required, the workshops where the works would be carried out, and the



-24-
time-frame involved. From the analysis of the equipment needs, which woul-d
take into account the present fleet and the probable future projects, the
overhaul program would aim to rehabilitate some 75 units of heavy equipment.
The Mechanical Branch would select suitable units from the existing stock and
prepare a list of spare parts and estimates for the overhauling cost to
ensure the economic viability of the rehabilitation. The major overhaul
program would be undertaken in the Meiktila and Rangoon workshops.
Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost US$0.03 M, Annex 2, Table 15)
4.17    Since the benefits of rehabilitation of the Ye-U systems are expected
to be realized in the form of incremental crop production by smallholders,
evaluation of the project would be assigned to the Project Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (PMEU) in the AC, which was established for earlier
IDA-financed irrigation projects, including Paddylands II, Tanks I, and
Groundwater Irrigation I. PMEU would carry out benchmark, mid-term, and
final surveys of project farmers, covering cropped areas, yields, input use,
irrigation water distribution, and changes in employment, output, and farm
incomes (see paras 6.13 and 8.08(d)). Monitoding and evaluation would con-
centrate on the 15,200 acres to be reclaimed and the 9,200 acres to receive
more reliable water supplies under the project, since these are the areas
expected to gain the largest incremental benefits. The project would finance
tne operating costs-associated with the surveys (enumerators' salaries, local
travel, secretarial services, printing, and binding) plus minor items of
office equipment.
Water Supply, Demand, and Quality
4.18    Water Supply and Demand.  The project would derive its water supply
entirely from the Mu River at the Kabo Headworks. Discharge measurements of
the Mu River at the headworks have been carried out since the beginning of
this century, but the records prior to 1946 were lost during World War II.
Therefore, daily discharge records available for the period from 1947 to the
present were used in preparing the project. Daily rainfall data for the last
32 years have been collected at about 30 stations in the ploject area and
nearby over varying numbers of years. The river flow data and rainfall
records used in the water supply studies were selected on the basis of the
availability, reliability, and length of recorded period.
4.19    Studies on water supply and demand have been carried out using com-
puterized model simulation in two stages. The total crop area used in the
models was 360,000 ac, including 128,000 ac in the Ye-U system. The stage 1
study, conducted by Euroconsult in 1983, assumed that the following crops
were irrigated: 336,000 acres of monsoon paddy, 4,500 acres post-monsoon
cotton, and 12,000 acres of sunflowers from December to March (see cropping
pattern in Annex 1, Chart 1). Water balance analysis included prewatering
requirements (4 inches of water to saturate soil profile, a 2 inch layer of
water on the field for nurseries, and a 4 inch layer for transplanting). The
crop evapotranspiration was computed by multiplying the Penman's evapotran-
spiration by the appropriate crop factors. The effective rainfall was



-25-
estimated by the daily soil wacer budget method of the FAO. 1/ The consump-
tive use for paddy, over the entire project area, is 682 mm T26.9 in) for the
140 days variety (Annex 1, Table 4), similar to the estimated consumptive use
of 595 mm (23.4 in) for paddy in the Kinda Dam Project which has comparable
climatic conditions. The irrigation water requirement was determined by
subtracting the effective rainfall (by 10-day period) from the consumptive
use and pre-watering requirement, and adjusting with an overall irrigation
efficiency of 50 percent (80 percent for conveyance, 85 percent for field
application, plus 2 mm/day percolation loss during the irrigation season).
The soils in the project area are of the heavy textured type, and past
experience during 60 years of operation does not indicate universal seepage
Loss from canals. Furthermore, no porous strata susceptible to excessive
2epage loss have been observed. The irrigation requirement, computed for
each 10-day period during the growing season, was compared with the stream
flow available for the project (using 32 years record of stream flow,
1950-81). The study showed that the full acreage can be irrigated with an
adequate water supply in 80 percent of the years. Further analysis indicated
that out of 32 years simulated, a significant reduction in paddy yield would
occur in only seven years, while yields of dry season crops would be adver-
sely affected in six years. Under the existing regulations for water alloca-
tion between Shwebo and Ye-U systems, there will not be sufficient water to
irrigate winter crops in Ye-U. In all other years, crop yields would not
have been affected by water shortages.  Using 10 percent plus or minus over-
all irrigation efficiency, the results show that the area under paddy is
almost insensitive to changes in irrigation efficiency. The stage 2 study
was similar to stage 1, but was designed to permit crop planting date, crop
sowing build-up pattern, and farm efficiencies to be varied as sensitivity
tests. The results of the stage 2 study are similar to those in Stage 1.
4.20    Water Quality.  The overall quality of water of the Mu River for
irrigation purposes is good. The water has been used for irrigation under
the existing project for more than 60 years without the development of
salinity or alkalinity problems. Samples taken in 1983 confirm the good
quality for irrigation (class Cl-Sl, according to the US Salinity Laboratory
Classification).
Engineering and Designs
4.21    Even though the Ye-U system was built nearly 60 years ago, the diver-
sion weir (crest height about 6 ft), head regulators, and sand sluices on
both banks appear to be stable. Major repairs were made on a portion of
weir, sand sluice and head regulator (on the opposite side of project area)
in 1956 by Brown and Root, Inc., a large and well-known American contractor.
The condition of the headworks structures has been inspected regularly and
scour patterns surveyed annually. Repair work on these structures, as
required, has been done promptly.
4.22    Construction equipment to be procured under ICB would be delivered
in year two of the project, and a modest construction program would begin at
1/ FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 25 (1974).



-26-
that time. GOB has agreed that ID would begin carrying out site surveys and
design work as soon as possible, and in any case not later than January 1986,
and would have finalized designs for at least 201 of works by the second dry
season and for the remaining works by the end of Year 2. No difficulties
are anticipated in the preparation of these designs, since ID already has
extensive experience with this type of work. Furthermore, this design
activity would not be expected to affect cost estimates significantly, since
most structures are of small, simple, and standard type. Current cost
estimates are based on sound feasibility studies and designs carried out by
an experienced international firm, Euroconsult. The final desigr of the
sediment ejector at the head of YMC would be completed during Project Year 2,
withl assistance from the consultant (para 4.13).
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Cost Estimates
5.01    The project is estimated to cost US$26.1 M, including import duties
and taxes of US$1.8 M and price contingencies of US$4.9 H. The foreign
exchange costs would be about US$11.0 M or 42% of total costs. These costs
are based on prices prevailing in late 1984, adjusted to mid-1986 levels.
Physical contingencies estimated for each cost item would amount to an
average of 15X of civil works and 10% of equipment costs. Price contingen-
cies for foreign currency costs are estimated on the basis of annual
inflation rates of 6.8% for 1987-88, 7% in 1989, 7.1% in 1990-92. Price
contingencies for local currency costs are estimated on the basis of annual
inflation rates of 8% in 1987-89 and 5% in 1990-92. Total price contingen-
cies would amount to about 26% of base costs. Cost estimates are detailed in
Annex 2, Tables 1-15, and are summarized below.

-28-
Financing
5.02    The proposed IDA credit of US$14.0 M would finance about 54Z of total
costs, including foreign exchange costs of US$9.2 M and US$4.8 M (36Z) of
local costs, net of duties and taxes (US$1.8 M) (Table 5.2). GOB would
finance about US$10.3 M equivalent, including taxes and duties. The GOB and
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) have agreed that UNDP would
provide grant-financing for the full foreign exchange costs of technical
assistance, training, and monitoring and evaluation of the project, amounting
to about US$1.8 M. Local costs associated with this technical assistance and
training (US$0.1 M equivalent) would be financed by the GOB.
5.03    This UNDP-financed subproject (total cost US$1.9 M) would be executed
in two distinct parts. For the specialized technical assistance required
to (a) design and test a silt excluder; (b) design the main and branch
canals, and (c) develop improved methods for operation of the Ye-U system
(US$0.4 M), the GOB would either select a qualified executing agency (exclud-
ing the World Bank) or execute these activities itself. For the remaining
US$1.5 M earmarked for planning studies and strengthening the Irrigation
Department, the World Bank would serve as executing agency, as requested by
the GOB. The signing of a project agreement between GOB and UNDP covering
both parts of the technical assistance would be a condition of effectivenes
of the IDA Credit.

Procurement
5.04    Civil Works (US$9.2 M). Project civil works would not be suitable
for international competitive bidding.(ICB). The civil works comprise a
large number of small. technically-simple, scattered works: earthwork, minor
repairs to existing structures, construction of small structures and build-
ings. Construction would also be subject to seasonal weather interruptions
and would have to be phased so as to minimize disruption of the irrigation
system operation. These works are, therefore, unlikely to be of interest to
foreign contractors. Since no private contracting industry exists in Burma,
ID would carry out the work by force account. This arrangement has worked
well for the Irrigation I Project (Credit 483-BA), and the Paddyland I
Project (Credit 642-BA) and is currently being used for civil works in the
Paddyland II Project (Credit 835-BA).



-29-
5.05    Equipment, Vehicles, and Spare Part$ (US$11.1 M).  Equipment,
vehicles, and spare parts, with an estimated foreign cost of about US$8.7 M
equivalent, would be procured through ICB in accordance with Bank's Procure-
ment Guidelines. A preference limited to 15X of the CIF price or the
prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to goods
manufactured locally in the evaluation of bids. Equipment, spare parts, and
materials and groupings thereof, estimated to cost the equivalent of less
than US$25,000, may be purchased through international shopping and on the
basis of comparing prices from no less than three independent suppliers. Such
purchases would be limited to a maximum of US$0.5 M.
5.06    The appointment of consultants would be in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Table 5.2 shows the procurement arrangement according to
categories of expenditure.

N ote: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts to be financed by IDA.
Disbursements
5.07    Disbursements from the IDA credit would cover the indicated percent-
age of total expenditures fo= each item, excluding taxes and duties:
(a) Civil works: 50%.
(b) Equipment, spare parts and construction materials:
(i) Directly imported - 100% of the foreign expenditures,
(ii) Locally manufactured, procured under ICB - 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost),
(iii) Off-the-shelf procurement - 70% of total expenditures.
5.08    Disbursements for civil works that are carried out by force account
would be made against statements of expenditure, the detailed documentation
for which would be retained by ID for review by IDA. All other disbursements



-30-
would be fully documented. It is expected that disbursements would be
completed by June 30, 1993, about six months following completion of project
implementation. The proposed allocation of the Credit is given in Annex 2,
Table 16, and an estimated semi-annual schedule for disbursements is given
in Annex 2, Table 17. Although the overall 'DA disbursement profile for
irrigation, drainage, and flood control projects is nine years, the disburse-
ment projections for this project are for seven years, because it involves
works that are simpler than those in average irrigation and drainage projects
used in the compilation of IDA disbursement profiles. The works are confined
to the rehabilitation of an existing, relatively small system. These projec-
tions are consistent with the completed Irrigation I project in Burma
(Cr.483-BA) which had somewhat similar, but more complex works.
Accounts and Audit
5.09    All GOB agencies maintain accounts according to procedures and forms
established by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. The Central Audit and
Inspection Office, acting on behalf of the Council of People's Inspectors, is
responsible for auditing GOB agency accounts and is acceptable to IDA as an
independent auditor for this project.  Assurances were obtained from GOB
that: separate accounts for each project component would be maintained by
respective implementing agencies and consolidated by the Project Unit (PU);
these accounts would be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing
principles consistently applied by the Director General, Central Accounts
Office, acting on behalf of the Council of People's Inspectors of GOB; and
the PU would send to IDA copies of the sunmmary of the unaudited annual
project accounts within six months after the end of the fiscal year, followed
by certified copies of the audited accounts and auditor's reports within 12
months of the end of each fiscal year.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
6.01    Implementation Responsibility.  The Irrigation Department (ID) would
be responsible for over-all project implementation. Divisions within ID and
their respective responsibilities would be as follows:
Construction Phase (Annex 5, Chart l(b))
6.02    A separate project entity would be established within ID.  A Superin-
tending Engineer (SE) would be appointed as Project Director and, together
with a small staff, would be based at the project headquarters in Rangoon.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that this Project Director would be
appointed by October 31, 1986.
6.03    The field organization would consist of four units under Executive
Engineers (EE), including two for construction and one each for design and
mechanical services. The Executive Engineer (EE) currently in charge of the
Ye-U irrigation division would be in charge of one of the two construction
units. In addition to the current staff at Ye-U of 1 EE, 2 Assistant
Engineers (AE), 7 Sub-Assistant Engineers (SAE), 145 technical and 55 support
personnel, a total of 501 staff would be redeployed from completed projects
such as Paddyland I and Kinda (Table 6.1).

6.05    Surveys (topographic, hydrographic, site, and structures) would be
carried out by ID, which would also handle design and planning. The testing
of a sediment ejector model would be conducted at a hydraulic laboratory
outside Burma, to be selected by GOB. Expatriate experts would assist in the
investigation and designs for the silt trap, canaL and canal system.
6.06    The project activities of the Agriculture Corporation (AC) would be
supervised directly by AC staff. The construction of training centers, HYV
camps, offices, and godowns would be entrusted to the Construction Corpora-
tion, following AC specifications.
Post-Rehabilitation Operation and Maintenance Phase (Annex 5, Chart l(b))
6.07    Irrigation Department.  The Ye-U irrigation division of Sagaing
Circle is already a long-established part of the ID, and its organization has
evolved to meet changing requirements. Its two subdivisions responsible for
the Ye-U command area would continue to manage irrigation O&M in the
post-rehabilitation phase. Under the future organization for the
rehabilitated system, the only additional staff requirements would be for
operators and mechanics for the proposed draglines, tipper trucks, and the
road 'roller to be transferred to 0&M from th-e construction phase. TheSe
additional (to be deployed) staff would amount to about 16 persons. -
6.08    Agriculture Corporation.  It is proposed that the Agricultural
Corporation would extend its Whole Township Programme (recently renamed the
Special High-Yielding Program) to cover Ayadaw, or at least the part of the
township within the commanded area. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that GOB would extend the Special High-Yielding Program to the entire project
area by September 30, 1987. A Project Extension Manager (PEM) would be
appointed to coordinate the extension activities of AC over the project area
to ensure consistency. He would be supported by two Subject Matter
Specialists, one Deputy Township Manager for Ayadaw, 9 Village Tract Exten-
sion Managers and about 43 Village Extension Managers, who would be required
in addition to the present establishment. To improve the effectiveness of
the extension staff, it is proposed to provide an office, training centers,
equipment, and transport. The operation of the input supply and distribution
activities of the AC would remain unchanged, but two additional godowns w.ould
be added with an appropriate increase in staff.



-32-
6.09    Other Agricultural Services.  The future operation of the Agricul-
tural Mechanization Department and Myanma Agricultural Bank would continue
without changes attributable to the project. The former is little involved
in the project Area, and the latter would expand the volume of credit avail-
able within the limits of its present organization. There are no plans to
establish new irrigation farmers' cooperatives in the area. Crop procure-
ment, marketing and milling facilities are adequate in the region, and no
changes would be envisaged.
6.1C    Farmers' Organizations.  Rural administration would continue as at
present. The ID would advise farmers groups, especially regarding water-
course operation and water-sharing during low discharges, and any disputes
would be regulated by the Village Councils. ID would also establish
guidelines for maintenance of watercourses by the farmers groups, to be
enforced by the local councils.
Mechanical Engineering Activities
6.11    The two distinct areas of mechanical engineering activities under the
proposed project would come under the overall supervision of the Deputy
Director (Mechanical) in Rangoon. The Deputy Director would coordinate
closely with the Project Director (para 6.12) to assure that these mechanical
engineering activities are implemented in accordance with the overall project
schedule. First, he would oversee the work of the Fleet Management Division,
to be=set up under the project in order to plan and direct the national
program for reallocating, overhauling, scrapping, and purchasing equipment
and spare parts. The Fleet Management Division, to be headed by an Executive
Engineer based in Rangoon,. would also be responsible for the upgraded
workshop facilities and on-the-job training of ID mechanics under the
project. Second; the Deputy Director (Mechanical), through the Mechanical
Circle for Upper Burma headquartered in Mandalay, would assist the Project
Director and the personnel of the Construction Division at Ye-U, in maintain-
ing the equipment and vehicles needed at the Ye-U site and in providing
operators for this machinery.
Project Management and Coordination
6.12    Assurances were obtained that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest
would establish a Project Unit (PU), comprising senior technical officers of
the two key implementing agencies. The PU would coordinate the planning and
the field execution of the project. It would be headed by the Project
Director from ID. Assurances were obtained that a Project Coordination
Commuittee (PCC) would also be formed in MAP, similar to the PCC for the
Paddyland I and II Projects and Kinda Dam Multipurpose Project. The PCC,
chaired by he Deputy Minister of MAF, would be composed of the heads of the
implementing and related supporting agencies. The Project Director would
serve as secretary of the PCC.  The Couuittee would be responsible for:
(a) reviewing annual work programs, budgets, and quarterly progress reports;
(b) establishing project-related policies and solving inter-ministerial
problems; and (c) conferring with IDA on project-related matters.



-33-
Project Management Information Systems
6.13    Monitoring of project activities would center upon the preparation of
monthly and quarterly progress reports. Information on progress in irriga-
tion rehabilitation and modernization would be contained in reports submitted
by the Executive Engineers in charge of construction at Ye-U. Data on
progress under the mechanical engineering components would be drawn together
in a report forwarded to the Project Director by the Deputy Director (Mechani-
cal). Monitoring of improvements to agricultural support services to farmers
in the project area would be undertaken by the Project Monitoring and Evalua-
tion Unit of the AC (Dara 4.17), already established under the Paddylands I
and II Projects. The PMEU report would first be scrutinized by the Central
Projects Benefits Mionitoring Committee, with representatives from AC, Settle-
ment and Land Records Department, Myanma Agricultural Bank, and Finance
Ministry, before beirjg sent to the Project Director. These progress reports
would be reviewed by the Project Unit once a month, and by the PIC on a
quarterly basis, in an effort to identify and resolve implementation
problems.
Implementatipn Schedule
6.14    Civil Engineering. Overall project implementation would take six
years (Annex 1, Chart 2). The procurement of major construction equipment
and vehicles, carrying out of additional surveying work and design data
collection, and preparation of final designs for the upcoming construction
season, would occupy the initial 18 month period. Each year, major construc-
tion activity would be confined to the dry months. Technical data required
for the model studies for the sediment ejector are already being collected,
and facilities for the model would be provided by international consultants,
who would be engaged to assist the ID engineers. Most of the major construc-
tion works would commence in the dry season of the second year of implementa-
tion (starting November 1988). The rehabilitation master plan engineer would
be recruited to begin his work around the end of the second year of project
implementation. The water management expert would be engaged for three
months around the beginning of the irrigation season during the secon- year
of implementation. He would return to finalize his report in the following
year. The silt trap and canal design specialist would assist the ID
engineers during three visits of 2-3 months each during the first part of
the construction period, starting in 1988.
6.15    Mechanical Engineering.  An equipment management expert and three
other mechanical specialists would be engaged according to the overall
implementation schedule. The design for improved workshop facilities (about
US$0.2 M) would be completed within the initial 18 month period, during which
time the procurement of equipment and materials would be completed and actual
construction would follow promptly. For the mechanical equipment rehabilita-
tion program, the preparation of a detailed plan would begin during the first
year. Procurement of spare parts would begin early in 1988, with deliveries
later that year. Actual equipment rehabilitation (repairs, overhaul) would
start in the third year.



-34-
6.16    Assurances were obtained from the GOB at negotiations that all of the
above technical assistance (paras 6.14 and 6.15) would be appointed by GOB,
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, according to the implementation
schedule (Annex 1, Chart 2).
VII. PRODUCTION, PRICES, FARM INCOME, AND COST RECOVERY
7.01    Agricultural Development without the Project.  Records of planted and
harvested areas over the 1972-84 period do not show a falling trend. lt is
therefore assumed that agricultural development without the project wo'.ld
remain the same as the present situation. The water distribution system
appears to have stabilized at its present state of disrepair; if funding in
real terms were to decline below its current level, however, the system could
deteriorate further with related declines in cropped areas, yields, and
production.
7.02    Agricultural Development with the Project.  As a result of (a)
improvements in drainage and flood control; (b) the rehabilitation and mod-
ernization of the distribution system; and (c) related improvements in water
management to be promoted by the project, there would be increases both in
the average annual irrigable area and in crop yields. The net irrigable area
would rise from 96,400 ac to 121,100 ac, an increase of about 26%. Of this
increase, about 15,200 acres would be from land that has not been cultivated
in the recent past because of deep flooding, while a further 9,500 acres
would be on land currently used for rainfed and periodically-irrigated paddy
cultivation.  There would also be a minor increase of 2,850 ac in the area
planted to chickpeas on residual moisture following irrigated paddy. With the
project, the average yield of HYVs is expected to rise from the present level
of 1.33 tons of paddy to 1.5 tons per ac, a 13% increase. These yield
estimates take into account h-istorical records of water availability showing
that, on average, a successful crop can be harvested on 91.3% of the net
irrigable (planted) area--impl,'ing a yield, witb the project, of about 1.65
tons per ac in succesEfully harvested areas.
7.03    Overall Agricultural Impact.  Anvex 1, Table 2 shows the present and
projected cropping pattern, yields, and production. At full development
starting in Project year 9, annual incremental output would amount to about
45,650 tons of paddy and 700 tons of pulses.
Narketing and Pricing of Project Output
7.04    Paddy.  Increme.;tal paddy production under the project would be
marketed through two channels. Part of it would be procured by the AFPTC
under its compulsory quota system (Para 3.22), and the remainder would be
sold by farmers through the private market, essentially for co=sumption
within the Sagaing Division. Private market sale of rice across township
boundaries is officially prohibited, but in practice the authorik:ies tolerate
private transactions in small quantities, which are often of hirher quality
than the rice distributed through government stores. Paddy procured by the
AFPTC would also be sold to consumers in the rice-deficit areas of Sagaing
Division. In this way, incremental output under the project would allow the



-35-
government to export an equivalent amount of rice from the Delta region,
which would otherwise have been needed to cover the chronic deficits of
Sagaing. It is estimated that 50% of incremental paddy would be bought by
AFPTC, and the other half would be sold through private channels.
7.05    Official prices for paddy were increased substantially in 1974.
Since then, however, except for the introduction in 1976 of a 4% premium for
higher quality vice, prices have remained unchanged. The basic AFPTC price
is thus currently K 438/ton for the traditional Ngasein varieties (Annex 4,
Table 2), K 465/ton for the HYV Emata varieties, and K 531/ton for the
highest quality Ngakywe. For each of the three varieties, quality premiums
are also paid for higher grades as determined by the percentage of moisture,
dust and impurities, and by color and maturity of the grain.
7.06    Since procurement prices of paddy have remained fixed for a decade,
while costs of production and the general consumer price level have gradually
increased, the gap between official and private market rice prices has
widened in recent years. In 1980, it was estimated that private paddy prices
were 1.5 to 2 times AFPTC procurement price 1/; by mid-1984, private prices
had reached 3 to 4 times the level of AFPTC prices. The same type of paddy
procured in 1984 by AFPTC for K 9.55/basket (K 465/ton), for example, was
selling in the Ye-U town market for K 35/basket (K 1,704/ton).
7.07    Chickpeas.  All chickpeas produced in the project area would be
marketed through private channels and destined for local consumption; AFPTC
does not procure chickpeas in Ye-U. The private market chickpea price
prevailing in 1984 has been estimated at K 2,232/ton.
Farm Income
7.08    For all three models representing agricultural producers in the
project area, net benefits from irrigated farming (excluding uplapd agricul-
ture and off-farm activities) are expected to increase as a result of project
investments (Table 7.1). For farmers already cultivating irrigated land,
more reliable water deLiveries and greater fertilizer use would lead to a 9%
increase in net incomes; although such a rise in income is relatively modest,
these farmers are still expected to participate in the project since
incremental returns to labor are estimated to be K 47/man-day, well above the
prevailing wage rate. For farmers converting from part-rainfed to irrigated
cropping, incomes would increase by 38%. The greatest beneficiaries would be
the 3,800 families currently occupying partially flooded land to be drained
under the project: their net incomes from irrigated agriculture are expected
to rise almost fourfold, starting in the fourth year after joining the
project.

Agricultural Cost Recovery
7.09     Background.  Among the countries of South Asia, Burma presents a
unique case in irrigation cost recovery. By enforcing low official crop
procurement prices, especially for paddy and cotton, GOB effectively recovers
the cost of O&M plus a portion of capital costs, even though crop procurement
is used mainly to raise general revenues rather than specifically to meet the
public costs associated with irrigation. The other major category of cost to
GOB in irrigation - subsidies on fertilizer - is also partially recovered
through procurement taxation. This indirect form of agricultural taxation
typically accounts for 98-99% of GOB revenues from public irrigation schemes,
thus overshadowing forms of direct taxation, including water charges and land
taxes.
7.10    Costs to GOB.  Costs to GOB have been estimated in terms of present
values (PV) 1/ over the 30 year project life: (a) total capital costs
(excluding price contingencies, taxes, and duties); (b) recurrent O&M
expenses, based on an average incremental cost of K 12/ac over the Ye-U
command area, and Cc) subsidies on incremental fertilizer inputs, calculated
in terms of the difference between international prices and GOB controlled
prices.  The incremental subsidy is estimated to be about K 64/ac at full
production in Project Year 9.
7.11    Revenues to GOB.  Recoveries by GOB have been estimated in terms of
PVs of GOB compulsory procurement taxation, plus land taxation and water
charges.  The compulsory crop procurement system imposes an implicit tax on
producers that increases progressively with farm size and yields, and
provides a significant cost recovery source. This amount, calculated as the
difference between the projected export prices and GOB's procurement prices
plus processing, storage,and transport costs, has been estimated at about
K 137/ac over the command area at full production. The land tax currently
varies from K 1.5 to K 4.5/ac in the project area, depending on flooding
hazard and water supply; for cost recovery analysis, this tax with the
oroject was assumed to be the maximum rate of K 4.5/ac on all irrigated land,
1/ A discount rate of 12% p.a. is used. Capital costs are net of residual
value of construction equipment, but include physical contingency costs.



-37-
or an average increment of K 1/ac. Water charges are taken as K 10/ac, as
stipulated in the Water Tax and Irrigation Tax Law enacted in 1982 for all
publicly-owned irrigation works, resulting in average incremental revenues of
about K 2/ac.
7.12    Expected Cost Recovery Performance.  It is expected that COB would
recover about 95% of incremental costs associated with the project over the
30-year life af the investment (Table 7.2). In present value terms,
incremental OM would account for 8% of costs to GOB, with fertilizer sub-
sidies and capital costs making up 35 and 57% of costs, respectively.
Indirect procurement taxation is expected to generate 98% of GOB recoveries.

Cost Recovery Ratio   -   95%
7.13    Assurances were obtained from GOB that, in the event that the cost
recovery index is eroded significantly through modifications to the existing
crop procurement system, GOB, in consultation with IDA, would make adequate
arrangements for the direct or indirect recovery of the O0M costs of the
project. GOB would periodically review such cost recovery performance and
transmit its findings to IDA; and if it is found that recoveries are not
adequate to meet O&, GOB would take the necessary steps referred to above to
cover O&M costs in full.
VIII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS
.Overall Impact
8.01    Irrigation Rehabilitation.  The project would promote more intensive
agricultural development through rehabilitation of deteriorated irrigation
structures (e.g., excavation and resectioning of canals), installation of
improved irrigation technology (e.g., silt ejector, flow measuring devices),
and drainage of currently flooded areas. The project would thus provide
fuller, more reliable supply of irrigation water to a larger number of
farmers in the Ye-U command area. This condition, combined with improved
water manAgement and strengthened extension and input supply services, would
result in increased cropped areag higher yields, and an expansion of overall
production (para 7.03). At the local level, this in turn would provide
higher incomes and increased employment opportunities for the roughly 20,000
families in the project area. At the national level, enhanced agricultural



-38-
output in Ye-U would lead to an increase in export earnings and an improve-
ment in Burma's balance of payments position.
8.02    Mechanical Branch.  The mechanical workshop components of the project
would encourage more efficient use of the Irrigation Department's extensive
fleet of heavy equipment, by overhauling 75 items for use in future irriga-
tion construction schemes. As a result, COB would be able to reduce its
importation of new equipment, thereby achieving both considerable overall
cost savings and a reduction in foreign exchange outlays for capital costs of
future irrigation development.
8.03    Institutional Strengthening.  The project would also have a major
impact on two wings of the Irrigation Department. ID-Civil Engineering would
develop a capacity to undertake long-term planning of irrigation rehabilita-
tion in Burma, as well as the ability to prepare pre-feasibility studies on
specific individual projects. Products of this enhanced capacity would
include a Master Plan for irrigation rehabilitation in the country, and a
pre-feasibility study for a follow-on investment to the Ye-U Project.
ID-Mechanical Engineering would develop a capacity to manage better the
Department s entire heavy equipment fleet, through the establishment of a
system for taking inventories, estimating future needs, scrapping old items,
overhauling used equipment, and ordering new items. This institutional
capacity would complement project investments in improved workshop
facilities, training for mechanics, and spare parts, in a program for repair-
ing used equipment. Such repairs would result in cost and foreign exchange
savings.
Employment Effects
8.04    At full development, the project is expected to generate an addi-
tional 1.4 million mandays (4,750 manyears) of on-farm employment for
families in the Ye-U area. This additional employment would mainly absorb
non-wage household labor which is currently unemployed during slack periods
of the agricultural season. During the six-year implementation period of the
project, construction activities would also provide employment for about 500
incremental staff of the Irrigation Department, and the hiring of
approximately 1.96 million man-days (about 3,270 persons annually for five
years) of unskilled labor to carry out civil works. This unskilled labor,
performed by the local population, would help to solve chronic dry-season
unemployment in the area and reduce the flow of seasonal migrants from Ye-U
to the towns and to the tea-growing Shan State.
Distributional Impact
8.05    Since about 85% of farmers in the project area have fewer than 10
acres of land, including 51% with less than five acres, the project is
expected to assist mainly the medium- and small-scale landholders in the
region. In fact, the poorer farmers who are currently hampered by loss of
irrigable land as a result of uncontrolled flooding, would receive the
largest share of project-generated benefits (para 3.20). Moreover, since it
appears that all farmers have roughly equal access to inputs, extension and
marketing services in the Ye-U area, enhanced water deliveries and AC



-39-
activities under the project would benefit all groups of producers without
bias.
Environmental Impact
8.06    Since the project would essentially rehabilitate and modernize the
existing irrigation system, no adverse environmental impact is expected as
a result of the investment. By improving drainage and removing flood waters
from a part of the command area, the project can in fact be expected to
reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases.
Foreign Exchange Effects
8.07    The project would have a positive effect on Burma's balance of pay-
ments, through its impact on rice exports from the Delta region. Incremental
production of 45,650 tons of paddy annually in Ye-U would enable GOB to
divert toward exports an equivalent amount from the Delta which otherwise
would have been required to cover deficits in Sagaing Division. On the other
side of the ledger, additional foreign exchange costs occasioned by the
project would include irrigation rehabilitation expenditures during the
six-year investment period plus the foreign exchange portion of incremental
0hH and production inputs during the 30-year life of the project. At full
production starting in year 9, incremental foreign exchange earnings from
rice exports (in constant 1984 dollars) are expected to be about US$7.0
million a year, while incremental foreign exchange costs would be about
US$2.0 million, resulting in a net benefit of US$5.0 million. Over the
30-year period, the present values-(PV) of foreign exchange benefits and
costs due to the project are estimated to be about US$32.5 million and
US$17.3 million, respectively, implying a lifetime net foreign exchange
benefit of US$15.2 million (Table 8.1).

Benefits to the Economy and Economic Analysis
8.08    The benefits to be derived from the rehabilitation of the Ye-U system
have been compared with the total investment costs of the project, minus the
workshop components (i.e., institutional strengthening of ID Mechanical,
Mechanical Branch services, and spare parts for equipment overhaul) which
would have no direct bearing on production in Ye-U. On this basis, the
Burmese economy would be expected to earn an overall rate of return of 20.2x;
at the opportunity cost of capital to Burma of 12Z, the net present value of



-40-
the project investment would be about K 55.9 million (US$6.9 million). The
economic cash flow for the project is Dresented in Annex 4, Table 7. The
principal parameters underlying the economic analysis are the following:
(a) Project Life and Phasing. The project life has been assumed to be 30
years. The phasing of project farmers' participation in the project
is has been related to the construction schedule for Ye-U and its
anticipated impact on farm production. When combined with phased
increases in yields for each farmer and changes in cropping patterns,
the build-up in production benefits under the project would take
place according to the sequence set out in Annex 4, Table 6. Since
farmers would only be able to derive production gains from the
project once ID has mobilized fully (Year 1) and completed the first
year of construction (Year 2), benefits would start in 1987 (Year 3),
build up to 53% of total incremental benefits in 1989 (Year 5), 95Z
in 1991 (Year 7) and would reach full production levels in 1994
(Year 9).
(b) Prices. For internationally traded goods, prices were based on the
IBRD-projected world market prices expressed in 1986 currency values.
Appropriate adjustments were made for freight, handling, processing,
and quality differences. Local costs and locally valued benefits
were expressed in border prices through application of appropriate
conversion factors, principally a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of
0.80. Year-specific prices were used for inputs and outputs over the
1986-1995 period, after which real prices were assumed to remain
unchanged. Shadow wage rates of farm labor were estimated to
approximate respective financial wages. Economic wages were derived
by adjusting the shadow wage rates. Annex 4, Table 1 shows the
prices used for financial and economic analysis, while Annex 4,
Tables 2-4 present the derivations of economic prices for tradeables
and the key cost recovery margins.
(c) Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC). The OCC for Burma has been
assumed to be 12%.
(d) Farm Production Benefits. Incremental farm production benefits were
based upon most probable yields attainable with project investments,
as expressed in the expected changes in cropping pattern, the farm
models for representative producers (Annex 4, Tables 5a-5c), and the
anticipated rate of farmer participation in the project. These
provide the parameters for estimating the stream of incremental
production and benefits by comparing the "with" and "without"
scenarios.
(e) Capital Costs. For calculating economic capital costs, price contin-
gencies and taxes and duties were excluded from financial costs,
which were then converted to economic values expressed as border
prices through the use of conversion factors. The project provides a
significant amount of construction equipment that can be used to
develop subsequent irrigation schemes; residual values were therefore
estimated for the last year of the construction period, amounting to
about 40% of the economic purchase cost of these items. Capital costs



-41-
under the project that are not related directly to irrigation
rehabilitation at Ye-U - the workshop components - were excluded from
the economic analysis.
(f) Other Project Effects. The following non-quantifiable or minor
effects have been omitted from the economic analysis:
(i) incremental employment and value added through incremental
commodity processing, handling, transport and marketing;
(ii) demonstration effects upon farmers outside of the project area;
(iii) improved health resulting from drainage of deeply flooded land;
and
(iv) cost savings from more efficient transport of commodities and
persons on roads and tracks improved under the project.
Project Risks and Sensitivity Tests
8.09    Ye-U Rehabilitation.  The rehabilitation and modernization works to
be carried out at Ye-U are relatively simple and straightforward from an
engineering perspective; thus, there do not appear to be any serious techni-
cal risks associated with the project. ID has already demonstrated its
ability to execute such engineering works in other irrigation projects and
would be expected to have the necessary manpower available during the
implementation period; thus, no institutional risks are anticipated. The
very modest increa-ses in paddy yields projected under the project are con-
sidered reasonable and low-risk in nature, especially in view of the improved
irrigation water supply and farm extension practices to be established. One
significant risk associated with rehabilitation of the Ye-U comand area
would be shortages of fuel and cement, which could delay implementation.
These shortages, which have slowed the progress of the Paddylands Projects,
should be largely alleviated by the completion of major works under the Kinda
Dam Project. Other risks which have set back implementation of the
Paddylands and Groundwater Projects (but not Kinda Project), and could affect
the proposed investments at Ye-U, include (a) slow rate of procurement, (b)
delays in appointing consultants, and (c) tardy preparation of detailed
designs. Since the proposed procurement schedule has taken into account
Burmese conditions and the experience of earlier projects, the risk of addi-
tional delays would be minimized.
8.10    ID Equipment Management/Workshop Components.  The proposed project
would put in place a comprehensive system for managing the ID's fleet of
vehicles and equipment. This would require a considerable expansion of the
Mechanical Circle's current capacity to (a) monitor equipment use and condi-
tion; (b) control spare parts inventories; (c) estimate future equipment and
spares needs; (d) manage programs for scrapping, overhauling, and purchasing
equipment; and (e) carry out repairs of in-service items. There is, thus, a
potential risk that ID-Mechanical would not be able to develop the technical
and managerial skills required to fulfill this expanded role. In order to
minimize such a risk, the project would provide substantial technical assis-
tance, especially during the first years of implementation, in order to help



-42-
establish the necessary information reporting systems and maintenance proce-
dures, and to train the staff of the Mechanical Branch in these domains so
that GOB personnel can sustain such improvements over the longer term. The
project would also minimize institutional risks by financing only a very
modest amount of spare parts; the ability of the Mechanical Branch to perform
equipment repair and overhaul would thus be tested on such a pilot scale
before greater quantities of spare parts are ordered.
8.11    Sensitivity Tests.  Switching values were calculated and a series of
sensitivity tests were carried out in order to assess the impact of changes
in costs and benefits on the project's economic rate of return (ERR). The
detailed results are shown in Annex 4, Table 8. The relevant switching
values suggest that the project ERR is fairly robust: costs would have to
increase by 26%, or benefits would have to decline by 212, in order to drive
the estimated ERR down to the 12% level of the opportunity cost of capital.
The sensitivity tests (sunmarized below in Table 8.2) also indicate that the
project's economic viability is insensitive to increases in construction,
O&M, and on-farm production costs. A one-year delay in realizing project
benefits without deLaying the investment cost stream would also result in an
acceptable ERR.  The project would furthermore remain viable even if the
economic price of rice were to fall by IOZ-20Z below the projections used in
the base case, which are already well below historical rice price levels.

IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01    The following assurances were obtained at negotiations:
Irrigation O&M
(a) GOB would increase its annual outlay for O&M of Ye-U irrigation civil
works to about K 3.88 million starting in the Year 2 of project
ipimementation, thus bringing total O&M expenditure for the Ye-U
system to about K 7.4 million a year, or K 61/acre (para 4.06).
(b) During implementation, GOB would review annually with IDA its
proposed budget for O&M of the Ye-U system (para 4.0b).
(c) Based on the results of such an annual review, GOB would adjust its
O&M allocations accordingly to ensure adequate O&H (para 4.06).
Accounts and Audit
(d) separate accounts for each project component would be maintained by
the implementing agencies arad collated by the Project Unit (PU)
(para 5.09).
(e) these accounts would be audited annually in accordance with sound
auditing principles consistently applied by the Director General,
Central Accounts Office, acting on behalf of the Council of People's
Inspectors of GOB (para 5.09).
(f) the PU would send to IDA copies of the summary of the unaudited
annual project accounts within six months after the end of the fiscal
year, followed by certified copies of the audited accounts and
auditor's reports within 12 months of the end of each fiscal year
(para 5.09).
Special High-Yielding Program
(g) GOB would extend the Program to cover the entire project area by
September 30, 1987 (para 6.08).
Recruitment of Staff and Consultants
(h) The Project Director would be appointed by Octob;er 31, 1986 (para
6.02).
(i) All of the technical assistance under the project (paras 6.14-6.15)
would be appointed by GOB, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA,
in accordance with the project implementation schedule (para 6.16).
(j) A Project Unit (PU) would be established comprising the senior tech-
nical officers of the two key implementing agencies (para 6.12).
(k) A Project Coordination Conmittee (PCC) would be formed (para 6.12).



-44-
Cost Recovery
(1) In the event that .he cost recovery index is eroded significantly
through modifications to the existing crop procurement system, GOB,
in consultation with IDA, wouLd make adequate arrangements for the
direct or indirect recovery of the O&M costs of the project. COB
would periodically review such cost recovery performance and transmit
its findings to IDA; and if it is found that recoveries are not
adequate to meet O&M, GOB would take the necessary steps referred to
above to IDA, to cover O&M costs in full (para 7.13).
9.02    Condition of Credit Effectiveness.  The signing of an agreement
between GOB and UNDP covering technical assistance and training would be a
condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit (para 5.03).
9.03    With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for the IDA
credit of US$14.0 million on standard IDA terms.

YE-U IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR
SILT TRAP AND CANAL DESIGN SPECIALIST AND WATER MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST
A. Introduction
As part of the project, a sediment ejector and other devices for
reducing the amount of sediment entering Ye-U Main canal would be con-
structed. A silt trap is proposed to be built in the head reach of Ye-U Main
canal to further reduce bed load, which otherwise would travel downstream
and silt up the canal system. Furthermore, most canals would be re-sectioned
to improve their capacities; new structures such as cross-regulators,
flow-measuring devices, and escapes would be constructed to improve the
hydraulic performance of the canal system and water distribution efficiency.
It is therefore necessary to set up rules for the operation and monitoring of
the sediment ejector and related structures, as well as other water control
and measuring structures. The two consultants listed below would be advising
and assisting the project staff in achieving the above tasks.
B.  Silt Trap and Canal Design Specialist
This specialist would be engaged for a total of 8 man-months to
assist the ID staff in finding the most efficient means to reduce sedimenta-
tion in the Ye-U canal system. He would also assist the ID staff in the
design of canals and drains. His duties would be:
(a) To assist ID engineers in reviewing the final design of the sediment
ejector as recommended by the institute carrying out the hydraulic
model studies;
(b) To set up a program for collecting technical data required for the
design of the silt trap and for the assessment of the szdiment ejec-
tor;
(c) To review the criteria for the design of canals and canal systems as
proposed by the ID design staff in the light of silt-excluding fea-
tures to be introduced under the project;
(d) To review the criteria for the design of drainage system as proposed
by the ID staff;



-70-
(e) To guide ID staff in assessing the performance of the sediment ejec-
tor and related devices following their construction, and operating
in conjunction with the gates at the weir and the canal intake (as
recomeaided following the model studies);
(f) To design the silt trap based on the collected data, and advise the
ID staff on the construction of the structure;
(g) To set up procedures for the operation of the silt trap;
(h) To assess the performance of the silt trap after being constructed,
and search for an improved design or modification of the one already
built;
(i) Based on the data on performance of the sediment ejector and
silt-reducing devices, review the validity of existing canal and
canal system design criteria. If appropriate, advise the ID staff on
improved criteria; and

YE-U IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANCY SERVICES FOR MODEL STUDIES
Sediment Ejector Model Studies
1.      A hydraulic laboratory wouLd be engaged to conduct model studies of
the proposed sediment ejector, to be constructed in the pocket upstream of
the Ye-U undersluice, in front of the Ye-U head regulator. The Mu River at
the headworks is about 700 ft wide. The headworks consist of Kabo Weir
(455 ft long), Shwebo Undersluice (4 spans @ 40 ft), Shwebo Head Regulator,
Ye-U Undersluice (2 spans @ 30 ft), and Ye-U Head ReguLator. Ye-U Main Canal
has a discharge capacity of about 1,750 cusec. There is a sharp
convexed-bend in the Mu river on the Ye-U side, approximately 2000 ft
upstream from the Ye-U Head Regulator. The bend causes the bed load to move
in the direction of Ye-U Head Regulator and enter the Ye-U canal. It is
proposed that:
(a) a sediment ejector be built just upstream of the Ye-U undersluice
in front of the Ye-U Head Regulator. The proposed ejector, as
preliminarily envisaged, would consist of a series of the 16 barrels
of 3 ft by 3 ft openings set on the existing floor of the intake bay;
(b) groynes or baffles be built upstream of the intake bay on Ye-U side,
in an attempt to reduce sediment Load entering the bay; and
(c) rules be established regarding the operation of the undersluice and
Ye-U Regulator gates as well as weir shutters, to minimize the amount
of silt entering the Ye-U main canal.
Model studies would be conducted to:
(a) find the most efficient dimensions and shape of the proposed sediment
ejector (i.e., size and shape of openings, location of upstream and
downstream end of barrels);
(b) examine the possibility of constructing groynes or baffles to reduce
the amount of sediment entering the Ye-U intake bay. The dimensions
and locations of groynes and/or baffles would be verified from the
results of studies; and
(c) determine procedures for operation of undersluice and Ye-U Head
Regulator gates to minimize the amount of sediment entering the Ye-U



-73-
Main Canal (i.e., to establish rules of operation of gates). The
effect of altering the pond level (by raising shutters) should also
be investigated.
General Information
2.  (a) Cross-section of the Ye-U Head Regulator is given in consultants'
report; I/
(b) The weir crest is at R.L. (Relative Level) 358.4. It has shutters
which, when lifted, form a pond level at R.L. 362.4. Upstream apron
is at R.L. 351.6;
tc) Historical hydrographs show maximum flood Level at R.L. 370.4 with
an estimated discharge of about 100,000 cusec. The record for the
period from 1950-81 shows maximum discharges to be 40,627, 42,548,
and 47,806 cusec for August, September, and October, respectively.
The river bed slope is approximately 1:2,500;
(d) Estimated area of prototype to be modelled could be roughly deter-
mined from figures provided in consultants' report;
(e) Consultants' figures show approximate location and preliminary shape
of the proposed ejector. Final dimensions and shape are to be found
by model studies;
(f) A limited number of samples of bed materials taken from the Mu River
and Ye-U Main Canal have been analyzed to find grain size distribu-
tion (ID files); and
(g) A few sediment samples were taken from the intake bay of Ye-U Head
Regulator and from Ye-U Main Canal for analysis (ID Files).
Tentative Program of Experiments
3. (a) Various dimensions of ejector (i.e. number of openings, size, shapes,
length) as considered significant should be investigated and tested;
(b) Since pond Level has influence on flow velocity in the ejector tun-
nel, the weir shutters should be set at, say 2 ft and 3.5 ft above
the weir crest, and the performance of the ejector checked;
1/ Preparation of the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project for the Ye-U Canal
Command Area by Euroconsult, September 1983, for COB.



-74-
(c) Groynes and/or baffles should be placed at predetermined locations
on the right bank of the Mu River upstream from the Ye-U intake bay,
and their effect on the amount of sediment approaching the intake
should be investigated;
(d) An attempt should be made in the test described in (c) above, to find
ways to reduce the formation of the sand bar upstream of the Ye-U
intake bay;
(e) Tests should be conducted to find whether the amount of sediment
could be further reduced by proper operation of the undersluice and
the Ye-U regulator gates. If the result is positive and significant,
revised procedures for gate operation should be prepared.
The scale for modelling should not be smaller than 1:200 for horizon-
tal dimensions and 1:50 for vertical distance.
Reporting
4.      A report is required.  It should contain the following technical
details:
(a) Selection of scale;
(b) SeLectior of materials for model (i.e. sediments);
(c) Program of tests (i.e. list of variation of experiments);
Cd) Results and discussion of results;
Ce) Summary of results;
(f) Recommended designs and procedures for operation.
General Suggestions
5.      The hydraulic laboratory personnel responsible for this assignment
should visit the site of headworks being proposed for studies. A similar
model test (with limited scope) was conducted in 1951 by the Central Water,
Power, Irrigation, and Navigation Research Station, Poona, India. The report
for the study is referred to as "Specific Note No. 214" dated February 12,
1951, entitled "Report on Model Experiments Conducted for Evolving Sand
Exclusion Devices for Ye-U Canal". A copy may be requested from the Irriga-
tion Department, Government of Burma. Since the presence of sediment ejector
would have technical impacts on the design of silt trap, canals and canal
system operation, the model studies personnel should exchange information and
views with the Silt Trap Specialist and Water Management Specialist while
conducting model studies.



-75-
Timetableble
6.      The model study should commence as soon as possible, even prior to
the effectiveness of the associated IDA credit, so that the results of the
studies can be incorporaced in the design of the actual sediment ejector and
reduction devices. The duration of studies, including data collection,
construction of the model and related facilities, testing, and report writing
should not exceed 18 months in total.

BURMA
YE-U IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANT FOR MASTER PLAN FOR
REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION OF IRRIGATION PROJECTS
A. Introduction
GOB has recognized the importance of rehabilitation and modernization
of existing schemes and is beginning to attach importance to investments in
rehabilitation. To systematically execute this work, a master plan for
rehabilitating its currently deteriorated irrigation systems, composed of a
series of projects which might be suitable for external assistance, would be
prepared. The master plan would be elaborated by a unit within ID, with the
support of a team of consultants.
GOB has adopted the folloving criteria for selection of projects for
rehabilitation and modernization:
-   The irrigation projects would be located in the drier zones of Upper
Burma, where rainfall is erratic.
-   The projects would cover run-of-the river diversion systems without
backing from storage reservoirs upstream.
-   The projects would focus on diversion and canal structures in
deteriorated condition, requiring urgent repairs and rehabilitation.
-   The projects would command at least 20,000 acres.
-   The projects would have significant potential for increased crop
production, as a result of favorable soil conditions, application
of modern agricultural practices, and better availability of water.
Accordingly, GOB has proposed the following five major irrigation
systems, constructed in the early part of this century, for rehabilitation
and modernization:
I.    Mu (Kabo) Systems (Shwebo and Ye-U),
II.   Zawgyi System,
III. Mon System,
IV.  Mann System, and
V.    Salin System.



-77-
Of the five schemes, the system on the right side of the Nu River has
been selected for the fist phase of the IDA-financed series of rehabilitation
investments. Preliminary investigations of the other four systems, and thi
Shwebo Canal System on the left bank of the Mu River, have been carried out,
and a report prepared.
COB has proposed the following tentative implementation program,
taking into account the projected financial and manpower resources of the
country:
1.  Shwebo Rehabilitation Project             1989-1995        6 yrs
2.  Zawgyi Rehabilitation Project             1992-1997        6 yrs
3.  Mon Rehabilitation Project                1995-2000        6 yrs
4.  Mann Rehabilitation Project               1997-2002        6 yrs
5.  Salin Rehabilitation Project              2000-2004        5 yrs
B. Consultancy Services
A team of consultants consisting of an irrigation engineer (team
leader) and an economist would be employed to prepare a technical evaluation
and economic analysis of the five projects listed in para A above. A total
of 18 man-months of services would be required. A number of ID counterpart
staff at various levels would be provided by ID.
C. Terms of Reference
Consultants would conduct pre-feasibility studies (i.e. technical
and economic) for all five projects and prepare an investment priority list
for implementation. The following would be included:
1. An assessment of water availability using available hydrological
data. The assessment would include a study of surplus water avail-
able during months of December, January, and February for dry season
irrigation.
2. Agricultural soil studies to determine crop production suitability.
If it is found that salinity has developed in potential project
areas, corrective measures should be examined.
3. Field investigation of irrigation system and related structures as
follow:
a. Diversion Weirs
- From the result of water availability study in para Cl above,
estimate the area that can be irrigated under the proposed
projects.



-78-
- Similar hydrological studies would be made of the flood dis-
charges to check the hydraulic and structural stability of the
diversion weirs.
- Topographical survey of the area of headworks would be carried
out.
- In cases where the diversion weir has to be replaced, more
detailed topographical surveys and geological investigations
would be carried out.
- Topographical surveys of the area of the pond behind the
diversion weir would be carried out for the determination of
the available pondage and the extent to which silting may take
place.
- The diversion weirs, particularly those built on permeable
foundations in the early part of the century, would be inves-
tigated for possible existence of large cavities under the
structures.
- Installation of sediment ejector at many headworks appears to
be inevitable, in view of large-scale silting that has taken
place and the location of the weirs. For this purpose related
data collection for use in planning and designing sediment
ejector would be conducted.
- Other devices such as deflecting groynes to divert the silt
toward the spillway portion of the diversion weir would be
considered.
b. Canal System
- Topographical surveys of the command area, including the canal
system, would have to be carried out if such maps are not
readily available.
- Detailed topographical surveys would be required of proposed
sites of major cross-drainage works, cross regulators, and
other major structures.
- Measurement of silt charge in the river and canal systems
would be made at suitable locations. The data would be used
for the assessment of silting.



-79-
- Plans of the proposed modernization, including new structures,
would be worked out. Adequacy of the hydraulic control and
the cross-drainage works would be checked, and new structures
introduced if necessary.
- Limited groundwater surveys would be carried out in certain
parts of the command area with a view to studying the conjunc-
tive use of groundwater and canal water.
- Adequacy of canal escapes would be checked to take care of
excessive discharges during heavy rain storms. Alternatively,
a study may be made to examine the use of existing tanks in
the comnand area as balancing ponds to reduce wastage.
- A study for introducing water management would be made. If
any additional structures or modifications of the canal system
are required, such works would be incorporated in the final
design for the modernization of the scheme.
4.  Investigation of drainage problems and recomuendation for remedies.
5.  Studies of operation and maintenance of irrigation systems including
a review of O&H expenditure and management of existing systems on a
national basis and recommend appropriate level budget allocation and
management for O&M.
6. Preparation of a tentative implementation schedule for each project.
7. Preparation of cost estimates for each project showing costs of major
components.
8. Preparation of economic and farm-level analysis at pre-feasibility
level, including sensitivity tests.
D. Consultant Team

of the studies. His services would be for four months.
E. Timetable
The ID would prepare detailed terms of reference and contract docu-
ments as soon as the credit is signed. The consultant team would be
recruited following procedures consistent with IDA's guidelines. It is
expected that the team would commence its work by the end of year two of
project. The contract period would be 14 months.
F. Reporting Requirement
1. A progress report summarizing the team's activities would be sub-
mitted to ID every two months.
2. An interim report describing progress of works and future work plan
would be submitted eight months after the commencement of the con-
tract.
