SECOND ROADS PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Republic of Guinea-Bissau
Beneficiary:       Ministry of Public Works, Construction and Urban Develop-
ment (MOPCU) and Ministry of Transport and Tourism (MTT)
Amount:            SDR 3.9 million (US$4.00 million equivalent) from IDA.
SDR 3.9 million (US$4.00 million equivalent) from the
Special Fund administered by IDA
Terms:             Standard
On-lending Terms:  None
Project
Description:       The project would assist MOPCU to build up its new organi-
zation and continue the rehabilitation of its road network
begun under the ongoing First Roads Project (Cr. 878-GUB,
approved in January 1979) and address important institution
building objectives in the transport sector. The principal
components of the project are: (a) rehabilitation of about
500 km of roads; (b) establishment of a routine maintenance
service; (c) training; (d) improvement of the ferry service
at key crossings; and (e) assistance with management of the
sector to MTT and MOPCU.
Project Benefits
and Risks:         The project would benefit the country by reopening roads
neglected since independence, and by reducing transport
costs on 500 km of roads. The project would also postpone
future rises in vehicle operating costs and future costs
for expensive reconstruction by assuring effective routine
maintenance. Improvements to the ferry service would
reduce the severe disruption to internal and external
communications caused by frequent breakdowns.
The project is a direct follow up to IDA's First Roads
Project (Cr. 878-GUB) during which three rehabilitation
brigades were equipped and trained, and the supporting
administrative and workshop facilities built up, so the
physical components present few risks. The fiscal and
administrative reforms to be set up to improve management
of the sector may be hampered by a general lack of adminis-
trative experience in this country. Even with 95% donor
financing there is a risk that Government will have diffi-
culty with counterpart financing. This risk would be

INTERNATIONAL DREYLOPfENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
AND A SPECIAL FUND CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A SECOND ROADS PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Devel-
opment Credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for an amount in various cur-
rencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3.9 million (US$4 million equiv-
alent) on standard IDA terms and a proposed Special Fund Credit administered
by the IDA of SDR 3.9 million (US$4 million equivalent) on terms adopted by
the Executive Directors of IDA 1- to help finance a Second Roads Project. The
project will be cofinanced by Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, which
will provide US$5-1 million equivalent on terms to be established in a sepa-
rate agreement with the Borrower.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The latest economic report on Guinea-Bissau (3529-GUB), dated May 21,
1982, has been circulated to the Executive Directors. The following assess-
ment of the current situation and prospects of the economy is based on the
conclusions of that report and updated figures provided by U.N. sources.
Country data appear in Annex I.
The Setting
3.       Guinea-Bissau is a small nation of around 810,000 inhabitants (1982)
located on the West African coast between Senegal and Guinea. Including the
Archipelago of Bijagos, the country covers an area of 36,135 km2. The
territory is generally flat with a few hills and a coastline interrupted by
seven large estuaries which run far inland. The soils are mostly alluvial and
fertile; rainfall is sufficient for a variety of crops, but the country is not
immune from drought. The society is segmented, with several ethnic groups.
Bissau is the national capital, the country's largest city, and its main port.
1/ Resolution No. IDA 82-6 of October 26, 1982.



4.       Guinea-Bissau became independent in 1974 and has since been governed
by the sole political party (PAIGC) as a non-aligned centrally planned econ-
omy. For the most part, the Government controls the modern sector of the
economy, with a smallholder sector prevalent in agriculture. Politically
Guinea-Bissau has been quite stable, in spite of a change in the party
leadership in late 1980.
5.       Guinea-Bissau's economic situation has been difficult.  A war for
independence resulted in the destruction of part of the limited economic
infrastructure. The country's administrative capacity was further reduced with
the exodus of the Portuguese, and it has had to depend on international
assistance for most essential supplies. To rehabilitate and develop the
economy, the Government relied on the growth of the public and parastatal
sector, but lack of administrative experience and unwise investment decisions
led the country into serious deficits and external indebtedness. Today,
Guinea-Bissau is still among the poorest countries in the world. GDP per
capita is around US$190 (1982), life expectancy at birth is 42 years, and 75%
of the population is illiterate. Only one-tenth of the people, mainly in
urban areas, have access to safe water. Waterborne diseases are rampant and
mortality rates reach 20 percent among children.
6.       In spite of this grim situation, the country has a potential for
development in the longer term. With good soils and large uncultivated areas,
agricultural output could adequately meet domestic demand for foodstuffs and
increase export earnings. There are promising indications that commercial
development of petroleum, bauxite and phosphates will be possible. Identified
resources in fisheries and forestry could generate substantial foreign ex-
change in the medium term and, with other raw materials and traditional
skills, provide the basis for a small manufacturing sector.
Structure of the Economy
7.       Agriculture is the most important resource of Guinea-Bissau.  It
accounts for about 50% of GDP, most of the country's employment, and 60% of
exports. The sector is basically subsistence-oriented, producing rice (the
main staple), sorghum and millet; agricultural exports are mainly groundnuts,
palm kernels and cashew nuts. Performance has been poor owing to lack of
incentives, inadequate infrastructure, and unfavorable weather conditions. An
overvalued exchange rate (between 1978 and 1983, the Guinean peso was pegged
to the SDR, while in the same period the main trading partners devalued by
around 20-25%) and inadequate producer prices have contributed to smuggling of
export crops and some food crops (e.g. rice).
8.       The fisheries sector, whose contribution to GDP is only about 2%, has
shown considerable scope for development, based on joint ventures with the
USSR (Estrela do Mar), Algeria (GUIALP), and Senegal and France (SEMAPESCA) to
handle the capture and marketing of fish products, and on provision, through
bilateral agreements, of licenses for foreign boats to operate in Guinean
territorial waters. Industrial production is presently about 1,000t per year
(supplemented by about 4,000t from artisanal fishing), compared to an esti-
mated potential of 300,000 tons per year. Catches of foreign boats are subs-
tantial and were estimated at 80,000 tons in 1980.  GUIALP has been shutdown



- 3 -
and the boats sold. Senegal has withdrawn from SEMAPESCA and the EEC has
provided 4 million ECU's to rehabilitate the enterprise. The Government is
taking steps to raise artisanal output by providing fishermen with improved
equipment and adequate marketing support.
9.       With 65% of its territory covered by forests, Guinua-Bissau has a
good potential for forestry development. However, out of estimated potential
output of 120,000 tons of timber per year, only 8,500 tons are now produced
(2,500 tons for export). The sector is managed by a state-owned company which
is receiving assistance from the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA) to improve its management and. diversify its activities.
10.      The industrial sector is still undeveloped (10% of GDP), and includes
a ship repair yard, some old plants for hulling rice and groundnuts, a few
bakeries, some icemaking units, and several repair sbh'ps for transport equip-
ment. Modern plants include a brewery, an assembly plant for Citroen cars, a
groundnut processing plant, and several other units which were created during
1975-79. The sector was affected by the lack of planning and project evalua-
tion capacity in the years immediately after independence and most industrial
units work at only a fraction of capacity, hampered by insufficient imported
raw materials and spare parts, and lack of adequate management and trained
workers. Of around 30 public and mixed enterprises, only one showed a profit
in 1981.
11.      The poor state of transport infrastructure is a major constraint on
development. The North is served by roads in need of repair and rehabili-
tation, a situation which was addressed by the First Roads Project and which
is also the subject of the proposed project. The South, the rice growing
region, with the most promising agricultural potential for domestic consump-
tion, is badly served. Inland ports and feeder roads are equally poor. The
port of Bissau, which handles most of the country's foreign trade, has inad-
equate facilities. Assistance for rehabilitation of its commercial berth and
of its navigation aid system is being provided in a SDR 14.9 million Credit
for the Bissau Port Project, approved on June 23, 1983.
Recent Developments
12.      Economic growth in Guinea-Bissau has been disappointing.  After a
modest growth of about 3.0% p.a. during 1975-79, real GDP declined by about 5%
in 1980. Agricultural production was affected by droughts, and foreign
exchange constraints induced supply shortages of imported goods, leading to a
decline in industrial output.
13.      The current difficult situation of Guinea-Bissau stems in part from
policies followed after independence. Substantial international assistance,
but inadequate aid management, led to a mushrooming of projects, many of them
ill-conceived, and dispersion and overlapping of efforts. Investment financed
from abroad was high (20-25% of GDP), but until 1980 most of it was allocated
to infrastructure, the social sectors, and to over-ambitious industrial proj-
ects. Poor producer prices in the rural sector contributed to a lack of
investment and production incentives for farmers already hurt by the over-
valued currency and export taxes. Consequently, agricultural output was



- 4 -
sluggish, with foodstuffs unable to meet domestic demand, and exports
insufficient to generate the foreign exchange needed to meet the demand for
imported consumer goods and inputs to the modern sector. Capital flows,
although large, covered only part of the current account deficit, so that
foreign reserves declined drastically and net foreign assets have been
negative since 1978. Meanwhile, the role of the public sector grew well
beyond its financing capacity, with the result that bank credit financed
around 50% of budget current outlays.
14.      The Government is committed to remedying the major economic disequi-
libria with renewed emphasis on agricultural development. The first stage of
a stabilization program was enacted on December 23, 1983. The peso was de-
valued by 100% from 41 to 82 to the US dollar. Export taxes were reduced,
reforms were begun in the state trading sector, and private traders were
permitted to engage in foreign trade and to have a greater role in the
domestic distribution sector. Farm prices have been raised by between 50% and
70%. Further reforms, including measures to generate additional fiscal reve-
nues, are expected shortly. The country is also seeking technical assistance
to strengthen economic management (see para 20 below). The recently adopted
1983-86 First Development Plan outlines a Government strategy which includes,
after implementation of the stabilization program, investments in priority
areas, specifically, agriculture, fisheries, wood production and mining,
sectors in which increased production would be designed to attain food self-
sufficiency and expand exports.
15.      Guinea-Bissau' s external payments position has been extremely diffi-
cult. Between 1977 and 1980, imports of goods and services (mainly capital
goods and foodstuffs) grew by about 20% per annum, three times faster than
exports, leading to a resource gap equal to 30% of GDP. In spite of substan-
tial capital inflows and foreign grants (averaging US$28 million and US$31
million respectively) the overall deficit reached US$8 million in 1980. In
1981 the situation improved; imports declined somewhat compared with 1980 and
exports of palm and fish products increased by 20%. Net inflows of medium and
long-term capital continued to rise, partly to cover the growing debt service
which reached US$10.1 million in 1981, or about 70% of exports. At end-1982,
external debt was at US$125 million (US$165 million including undisbursed);
payment difficulties had increased and arrears on medium and long-term loans
were estimated at US$21.1 million (US$29.4 million including arrears on short-
term loans and suppliers credits). Help from the IMF was provided in 1981 (an
SDR 1.9 million compensatory financing facility), and from Portugal in 1982
under bilateral assistance.
16.      Guinea-Bissau' s government has shown an encouraging recognition of
past difficulties in economic policies, and a convincing commitment to reha-
bilitate the nation's economy. At a donor's conference held in November 1983
in collaboration with the Bank and the Fund, the Government outlined its
stabilization and reform program and secured assurance of more than US$15
million in emergency external aid, the principal contributors being Sweden,
Portugal, Holland and the EEC. Negotiations are about to begin with the IMF
aimed at agreement on a stand-by program. The Association, in turn, has begun
discussions, designed to formulate a program of structural adjustment which
could be supported with a structural adjustment credit.



- 5 -
17.      The Government has thus launched a politically courageous program of
economic reform. Nevertheless, recovery will be difficult in spite of the
Government's commitment. The present subsidized price of rice to consumers
should be increased substantially, and consistent policy to expand exports is
required.  To support the efforts of this young nation to place its economy on
a sound footing, heavy inflows of external assistance are now required. In
view of the country's extremely limited fiscal capacity, and its high debt
service burden, external project financing will need to cover a large share of
project costs and non-project financing would be desirable. External capital
assistance will have to be provided on very soft terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GUINEA-BISSAU
18.      IDA has made four credits to Guinea-Bissau totalling US$44.9 million.
Two have been in the transport sector and two were for petroleum exploration.
Compared with other official development agencies, the number of IDA opera-
tions in Guinea-Bissau is modest. As of mid-1982, IDA commitments accounted
for 9 percent of total external debt outstanding, including undisbursed. Annex
II contains a summary of IDA operations in Guinea-Bissau.
19.      In keeping with Government strategy in the transport sector, IDA
asistance has concentrated on urgently required rehabilitation and maintenance
of roads in the First Roads Project, Credit 878-GUB of US$9.0 million, ap-
proved in FY79, and of the Port of Bissau and subsidiary ports in the Bissau
Port Project, Credit 1392-GUB of SDR 14.9 million approved in FY83. The two
credits in the petroleum sector are assisting the Government in promoting
offshore oil exploration and provide for collection, processing, and evalu-
ation of seismic data, training and physical facilities, as well as assistance
in promoting exploration contracts.
20.      Future IDA operations in Guinea-Bissau in the medium term should be
responsive to the Government's economic policy reforms as well as to its
requests for assistance in the rehabilitation of its infrastructure. A
technical assistance project to strengthen the key economic ministries and
which includes a survey of some of the country's troubled public enterprises,
has been appraised, and, as noted, discussions have started to formulate a
structural adjustment program. Under the Cooperative Programs with the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and UNESCO, surveys of the agriculture and
education sectors were carried out in 1983, and will form the basis for dis-
cussions with the Government in early 1984. These reviews may open the way
for direct IDA participation in these important sectors, to supplement bi-
lateral aid programs.

PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
21.      Guinea-Bissau's transport network comprises 2,300 km of roads, of
which 485 km are paved, a deep water port and an international airport at
Bissau, about 27 small coastal and river ports, and 17 landing strips of which
only 10 are in good condition. Most domestic and international traffic flows
through Bissau and its port, although small amounts of goods are transported
by land to and from neighboring Senegal and Guinea. River transport accounted
in 1979 for 52% of tonnage, mainly in the south, while road transport account-
ed for the remaining 48%, primarily in the north and east. Except for inter-
national passenger traffic, less than 25% of which is handled by the national
airline, Linheas Aereas da Guine-Bissau (LIA), air transport is negligible and
no early expansion is expected. The distribution among modes of transport is
appropriate and reflects economic transport costs. However, considering the
linkages between road and river transport, particular attention needs to be
given to appropriate coordination and planning in the development of a bimodal
road/river transport network.
22.      The extent of the road network is in general adequate to meet the
country's present needs. However, maintenance is inadequate and there is a
considerable backlog of rehabilitation work to be done. Consequently, execu-
tion of priority rehabilitation works and the development of an institutional
capacity to carry out routine maintenance in a timely and efficient manner
have been the principal components of the ongoing First Roads Project and are
the focus of the proposed project.
23.      The seven rivers with wide estuaries intersecting Guinea-Bissau's
territory, along which most inhabitants live, result in ferry crossings being
an important component in the continuity of the road transport network. In
January 1983, the Government transferred responsibility for four principal
crossings to MOPCU. Assistance for ferry operations and maintenance is in-
cluded in the proposed project.
Oil Products Pricing
24.      Until 1978, retail prices for petroleum products generally moved in
line with CIF import costs and domestic inflation. Increases in subsequent
years were insufficient to match the large increases in import costs which
took place in 1979-80. Following a 20% increase in March 1983, retail prices
of petroleum at present are above the CIF import cost plus delivery cost, with
the exception of diesel fuel which still receives a very small subsidy. How-
ever, fuel taxes are still insufficient. They do not cover road user costs,
because of insufficient taxation level and widespread tax exemption for the
public sector. In addition, insufficient fuel price for road users may cause
non-optimal modal allocation between roads and rivers. Following the December
23, 1983 devaluation of the GP, urgent action is needed to increase proceeds
from fuel taxes. The Government is taking action in three steps: (a) in the
short run, all tax exemptions have been suppressed; (b) by September 30, 1984,
fuel prices will be increased and taxes doubled up to GP 26 per liter on



- 7 -
gasoline and GP 15 on diesel fuel; (c) in the long run, fuel prices will be
adjusted to the economically optimal level by June 1, 1985, following the
completion of a study on fuel taxation and administrative organization of tax
collection, financed under the Bissau Port Project.
Transport Companies
25.      Road transport has been a subsidiary activity of two public trading
companies, Armazens do Povo and SOCOMIN, which together account for sixty
percent of freight movement on land. The two companies have major management
and operational problems, which have resulted in provision of a service that
is inadequate and expensive, a factor which in turn limits, among other
things, the development of rice, fruit, and vegetable production. Government
is planning to transfer responsibility for transport from these companies to a
new national transport company. At the same time, it is planning to increase
the role and market share of the private sector in transport. The Ministry of
Transport and Tourism (MTT) is reviewing a report on the creation of the new
company, which would also assume the coastal and river transport functions
presently performed by GUINEMAR. Technical assistance for start-up of the
company is included in the IDA-supported Bissau Port Project. The national
bus company, SILO DIATA, encountered major management problems in FY1982, and
was closed down in 1983. The Government is presently envisaging either a
rehabilitation of the national bus company, or its privatization.
Transport Institutions and Planning
26.      Transport planning has been hampered both by a lack of qualified
staff and by poor coordination between the ministries and public bodies con-
cerned. The 1983-86 Development Plan reinforces the Government's commitment
to improve transport efficiency and to concentrate investment in the priority
areas rehabilitating the port of Bissau and other ports, continuation of the
road rehabilitation program, and the development of road maintenance capacity.
In addition, the Plan's sectoral objectives have become more diversified, and
include improvements to the ferry system and its operations; improvements in
the institutional framework for transport planning and sector management;
creation of a National Transport Company and increasing the role of private
transporters; and measures to strengthen road user cost recovery and road
maintenance funding.
27.      Transport planning is principally the responsibility of MTT, with the
Ministry of Public Works, Construction, and Urban Development (MOPCU) playing
a subsidiary role, and the Secretariat of State for Planning acting in a co-
ordinating capacity. In practice, however, MTT exercises little effective
control over the sector and has been hampered in its efforts by a lack of com-
petent staff, and by the absence of a national transport plan or clearly de-
fined transport policy. Institutional and policy issues affecting the opera-
tions of MTT are being addressed in the ongoing Bissau Port Project and in-
clude preparation of a new charter for MTT to strengthen its role in policy
definition and implementation, in planning and coordination, and in regulation
and supervision of state enterprises in the sector. In order to ensure an
adequate balance between road construction and maintenance, the Government
will submit to the Association for comments by May 31, 1985 and annually by



- 8 -
July 31 thereafter its annual road investment and maintenance plan, and the
corresponding budget proposal for the following fiscal year (Section 3.10 of
the draft Development Credit Agreement).
28.      Within MTT, the Directorate of Land Transport (DTT) is responsible
for sub-sector administration. Its duties cover vehicle inspection, licensing
of vehicles, drivers, and public transport operators, road safety and signing,
record keeping, and enforcement of Government axle load regulations. Since
these tasks are carried out in a rudimentary fashion, the proposed project
includes assistance to DTT in the important areas of road safety and signing,
record keeping, and enforcement of axle load regulations. To this end, Gov-
ernment has agreed to strengthen enforcement of its existing axle load regula-
tions by January 1, 1985 (Section 4.03 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement), and present annually to the Association by December 31 a satis-
factory budget allocation for project execution under a separate budget line
in MTT's budget (Section 3.01 b of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
It also agreed during negotiations to present annually by November 30 to the
Association an acceptable work program for DTT (Section 3.02 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
29.      MOPCU is a large ministry with a wide range of duties, a large number
of employees (1,750) but little working equipment. Because of its generally
weak organization and administrative capacity, a semi-autonomous project unit
was created under the First Project to run the three rehabilitation bri-
gades. However, under the proposed project, this unit will be merged with the
existing Roads and Bridges Directorate (DEP). The influence of the Director-
ate General for Administrative, Technical, and Financial Affairs (DGAT), which
was wholly responsible for management of the First Project, will diminish
under the proposed project, and by January 1, 1985, will be confined to fi-
nancial administration only. The entire MOPCU is presently undergoing an
extensive reorganization geared toward improving management, developing urban
planning, and improving national building standards. The proposed project
will finance technical assistance for the reorganization. Regarding road
maintenance, after the integration of the road maintenance units created under
the First Roads Project into DEP, the present Roads and Bridges Directorate
will be upgraded into a General Directorate, directly under the Secretary
General of the Ministry. In the longer run, the Government wants to transform
this General Directorate into an autonomous Highway Authority. As the backlog
of road rehabilitation is gradually reduced, staffing requirements will fall
correspondingly. Government will review MOPCU's staffing levels with the
Association annually by October 31 (Section 3.05(e) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement) with a view to reducing DEP staff to 400 by June 30, 1988.
Staff training is needed throughout the Ministry and the proposed project
provides for refresher training of existing brigade staff, on-the-job training
for DEP staff, and short courses abroad for brigade and workshop chiefs.
These and other organizational changes constitute part of an Action Plan (see
para. 31 below), which forms part of the agreement between the Government and
the Association.



-9-
Sector Finances
30.      In recent years, the Government has given high priority to the expan-
sion and rehabilitation of transport infrastructure. Between 1978 and 1981,
an annual average of about US$23 million, or 27% of the total investment bud-
get, was allocated to the sector, almost all of which was financed from
external sources. Road user taxes cover only about 60% of the insufficient
expenditures for road maintenance, although improvements have been made to the
tax structure recently with the removal of tax exemption for the public sector
and the taxation of diesel oil. Under the Port Project, Government is con-
ducting a Road User Taxation Study to determine appropriate levels of taxation
to cover road maintenance costs. Fuel prices and taxes are also being studied
under the Second Petroleum Project, as well as a restructuring plan for the
state oil importer, DICOL.
31.      The need to establish a sound basis for road maintenance funding and
cost recovery from road users has been discussed between the Government and
the Association and has led to the formulation of an Action Plan to be carried
out under the proposed project (Section 3.05 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). The Action Plan establishes the principles that road user charges
should at least equal the cost of road maintenance and that adequate funds
should be made available to the responsible authority in a timely manner. It
provides for establishment of a Road Fund satisfactory to the Association by
January 1, 1985 through which to channel road user revenues. The Plan defines
the approximate network to be maintained on an annual basis and establishes
the minimum annual budgets required to maintain this network, and, thus, the
revenues required. In addition, it allows for a gradual progression of re-
venue collection to the projected necessary levels. The Action Plan also
provides that in determining the appropriate level of taxation on road users
required to generate the necessary revenues, the Government will take into
account the results of the study on Road User Taxation mentioned in para. 30
above. In order to ensure that road user funds are utilized efficiently, the
Action Plan also includes a timetable of personnel and organizational changes
to be undertaken by MOPCU during project execution.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.      The proposed project is a continuation of efforts begun under the
First Roads Project to build up the road maintenance capacity and to reduce
the backlog of periodic maintenance.  The project was appraised in March 1983,
and an advance of US$650,000 from the Project Preparation Facility was granted
in July 1983 principally for priority equipment rehabilitation so as to ensure
prompt start-up of the brigades' work under the proposed project. Staff
Appraisal Report 4717-GUB is being circulated separately and supplemental
project data are contained in Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington
on January 25 to 28 with the Guinea-Bissau delegation led by Mr. Adelino Mano
Queta, Secretary General of MOPCU.

Project Description
33.      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) continue
the road rehabilitation program; (ii) establish a routine maintenance capacity
within MOPCU; (iii) improve ferry operations; and (iv) strengthen sector in-
stitutions and operations. The project also aims to respond to broader Go-
vernment objectives in the sector by helping to establish a sound system for
raising road user revenues and providing timely financing for road maintenance
activities.
34.      The proposed project would include:
(a)   rehabilitation of about 500 km of selected roads, of which
about 200 km are paved and 300 km are laterite or earth;
(b)   establishment and equipping of regional depots for routine road
maintenance;
(c)   training for all levels of MOPCU staff;
(d)   equipment and assistance to MOPCU for ferry operation;
(e)   assistance to MOPCU for general management, public accounting,
urban planning and laboratory; and
(f)   assistance to the Ministry of Transport and Tourism for axle
load control and road signing.
Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance
35.      The roads to be rehabilitated have been selected according to econo-
mic criteria. The Government also confirmed during negotiations its agreement
to submit its road rehabilitation proposals to the Association for approval
and not to include sections with an economic rate of return of less than 12
percent (Section 3.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Regional
depots for routine maintenance will be established at Gabu and Farim,
consisting of workshops, stores, offices and some housing, similar to those
already established at Buba and Bissau. At each depot a routine maintenance
brigade will be established, and by the end of the project all roads rehabili-
tated up to that date should be receiving routine maintenance. The Action
Plan (para. 31) will ensure continuation of adequate road maintenance after
completion of the project.
Technical Assistance for MOPCU's Reorganization and Urban Development
36.      MOPCU's reorganization (para. 29) extends beyond road maintenance, to
the ministry's accounting system, finances, administrative organization, and
to the directorates in charge of urban development and civil works supervi-
sion. As the success of the reorganization of road maintenance depends on the
overall management of MOPCU, and it is not desirable that the reorganization
be split between several consultants, the general reorganization of the minis-
try, the urban and civil works directorate and MOPCU's laboratory was included



- 11 -
in the project, for 145 man-months. This includes 60 man-months of accounting
and public management specialist 10 man-months of legal expert and 75 man-
months of experts in geotechnics, construction standards, and urban planning.
An outline of terms of reference for this technical assistance was agreed upon
during negotiations.
Technical Assistance and Training for Road Maintenance
37.      The project would provide 105 man-months of technical assistance over
the three-year implementation period. Technical assistance to MOPCU would
consist of a civil engineer to work as adviser to the project director, a
project administrator/mangement specialist, and a chief mechanic/equipment
inspector. This core team would be assisted by two instructors and a workshop
specialist for the training programs. The project includes training for MOPCU
technical and administrative staff and short courses overseas for brigade and
workshop chiefs. Government will submit for the Association's approval
details of the proposed overseas courses and the CVs of the proposed candi-
dates, and ensure that candidates returning from overseas courses remain at
least three years with the Government (Section 3.04 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Ferry Operations
38.      The project includes acquisition of a 20-30 ton reserve ferry boat,
provision of a mobile workshop and an initial supply of spare parts and other
materials, and repairs to four ferry ramps. The project also includes tech-
nical assistance and training to improve the administrative and financial
aspects of ferry operations, as well as a study to assess the country's longer
term fluvial and marine ferry needs.
Assistance to DTT
39.      The operations of DTT will be strengthened through provision of
vehicles, equipment and financial resources for carrying out road signing
activities, and for administrative improvements in record keeping. In addi-
tion, DTT's capacity to monitor enforcement of existing axle load regulations
will be enhanced.
Project Cost and Financing
40.      The total cost of the project, including taxes on fuel and salaries
and contingencies, is estimated at US$13.8 million, with foreign exchange
costs of US$11.8 million or 85 percent. Average man-month costs of consult-
ants' services, including salaries and overhead, are estimated at $12,500.
Physical contingencies have been included at a rate of 10%. Price contin-
gencies have been calculated on the basis of the following annual rates: 1984
- 8%; 1985 - 7%; 1986 et. seq. 6%. Total contingencies amount to US$2.9
million, or about 20% of total cost.
41.      A proposed Kuwait Fund loan would finance US$5.1 million equivalent
(37% of project cost). The proposed IDA and Special Fund Credits would cover
US$4.0 million equivalent (SDR 3.9 million) each or 29% of project cost each,



_ 12 -
and the Government will finance US$0.7 million equivalent (5% of project
cost). The proposed IDA and Special Fund Credits would be made on standard
terms to the Goverment.
Project Execution
42.       Project implementation will be the responsibility of a comittee
including MOPCU, MTT, MEF and the Ministry of Justice. The comittee will also
be responsible for the implementation of the Action Plan. Road rehabilitation
and maintenance will be carried out by force account by MOPCU, whose DGAT will
have administrative and financial control of the project. MTT will be respon-
sible for execution of the project component dealing with assistance to DTT.
Coordination of implementation of the Action Plan, which will involve other
branches of the Government, will be the responsibility of MOPCU.

Procurement for the items to be financed through the Special Fund Credit would
be limited to goods produced in, or services from, countries eligible for pro-
curement under the rules of the Special Fund Credit. Bidding documents for
all major purchases are being prepared. All purchases and contracts above
US$50,000 will be subject to prior review. Equipment bids are being invited
on the basis of a price for the basic equipment, for spares and consumables to
be delivered with it, and for spares to be purchased as and when required from
a priced list which will form part of the contract.
44.      Proceeds from the proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures for equipment for road construction, workshop
equipment, vehicles and spare parts (US$270 thousand equi-
valent);
(b)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures for road construction material (US$12 thousand);
(c)   85 percent of the cost of fuels and lubricants (US$127. thousand
equivalent);
(d)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local ex-
penditures for ferry boat engine, spare parts, and materials
for the ferry fleet (US$48 thousand equivalent);
(e)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures for technical assistance, auditing and ferry study
(US$597 thousand equivalent);
(f)   100 percent of foreign expenditures for technical assistance to
IOPCU for urban development and reorganization (US$1,394 thou-
sand equivalent);
(g)   initial deposits into the special accounts (see para 46 below)
(US$100 thousand equivalent); and
(h)   refinancing of the PPF advance (US$650 thousand equivalent).
US$814 thousand would remain unallocated. Requests for disbursements from the
IDA Credit on items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) would be fully documented,
except for some spare parts procured under (a) and special lubricants under
(c) through the revolving funds. For these items, disbursements will be made
on the basis of statements of expenditure; detailed documentation will be
retained by the Borrower and available for inspection by the Association. As
a special condition, disbursements may be suspended if the Kuwait Fund loan is
not effective by October 1, 1985, or any later date that the Association may
agree, and if the Government has not secured funds for an equivalent amount
from another source on acceptable conditions.

45.      Proceeds from the proposed Special Fund Credit would be disbursed to
cover:
(a)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures for road maintenance equipment, and for equipment
to DTT and rehabilitation of equipment by contract (US$1,488
thousand equivalent);
(b)   74 percent of wages of temporary MOPCU employees (US$909 thou-
sand equivalent);
(c)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures for a ferry boat and spare parts (US$240 thousand
equivalent); and
(d)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures for technical assistance for road maintenance,
auditing and consultant services (US$566 thousand equivalent).
US$794 thousand would remain unallocated. Disbursements from the Special Fund
Credit items (a), (c) and (d) will be fully documented. Disbursements against
item (b) will be made on the basis of statements of expenditure; detailed doc-
umentation will be retained by the Borrower and available for inspection by
the Association. As a special condition, disbursements may be suspended if
the Kuwait Fund loan is no+ effective by October 1, 1985, or any later date
that the Association may agree, and if the Government has not secured funds
for an equivalent amount from another source on acceptable conditions.
46.      To facilitate procurement of spare parts and smaller items unavail-
able in Bissau, it is proposed that a revolving fund be established at the BNG
by opening of two accounts in correspondent banks of BNG in Dakar and Lisbon
for purchases to be made in these cities. Upon Credit effectiveness, IDA
would deposit the equivalent of $50,000 into each of these accounts which
would be replenished upon presentation of justification of past expenditures.
Establishment of these accounts would be a condition of Credit effectiveness
(Section 6.01(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The Government
will also establish a local currency account at BNG through which its own
contribution to the project, chiefly wages, will be handled. A further condi-
tion of Credit effectiveness is that the Government will have opened this
account and deposited its GP 20 million contribution for the first year of the
project (Section 6.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
417.     The overall economic rate of return of the proposed project is esti-
mated at 37 percent. Project benefits arise chiefly through savings in vehi-
cle operating costs accruing to transporters, and through savings in
Government expenditures on road rehabilitation and maintenance resulting from
timely and less costly execution of these activities. These savings have a
high foreign exchange component of particular importance to Guinea-Bissau.
The ferry component will generate savings that are expected to accrue primar-
ily to consumers, retailers and traders through reduced breakdowns and



- 15 -
detours, as well as contributing to increased accessibility and continuity
within the country's overall transport network.
48.      Since this project is a continuation of the First Project, under
which the brigades and their supporting workshop and administrative structure
were established, the physical components present few risks. The main risks
of the project are that implementation will be hampered by a general lack of
administrative capacity in the country and that resource constraints will make
it difficult for Government to provide counterpart funds. These risks are
addressed through the technical assistance and training support provided by
the project and through the administrative arrangements for ensuring timely
project funding. Nevertheless, implementation of the proposed Action Plan
will require careful monitoring.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.      The Draft IDA Development Credit Agreement and Draft Special Fund
Credit Agreement between the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and the Association,
and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1
(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.
50.      Special conditions of the Draft Development Credit and Special Fund
Agreements are referred to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III
to this report.
51.      Special conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(a)   the Government has provided at least GP 20 million for its
contribution to the first year of the project (para. 46); and
(b)   the Government has opened the bank accounts referred to in
para. 46.
52.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit and Special Fund
Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
