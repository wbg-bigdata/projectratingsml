PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
1.        This report represents an evaluation of the Second Roads Project
(Cr. 1473-GUB) in Guinea Bissau, for which an IDA credit of US$4 million
equivalent and a Special Fund administered by IDA for US$4 million
equivalent (F018) were both approved on May 8, 1984. Both credits are
virtually fully disbursed with about US$327 and US$3,269 equivalent, to be
cancelled under the IDA and Special Fund Credits, respectively (taking into
account adjustments in exchange rate). The IDA credit was closed on
January 12, 1990, the date of last disbursement, and the Special Fund
Credit was closed on May 8, 1989, the date of last disbursement.
2.        The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Infrastructure Operations Division of the Western Africa Department. The
PCR is based on project correspondence and documentation, supervision
reports and discussions with staff currently assir-ed to the project as
well as with staff familiar with the history of the project.
3.        The PCR was prepared by the Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), which sent the PCR to the Borrower
for completion of Part II but no reply has been received. The PCR t8
based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, supervision
renorts, corresoondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal
Bank memoranda

PROJEXCT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation SummarZ
Obiectives
1.        The primary objectives of the project were to continue
rehabilitation of the road network begun under the First Roads Project and
assist with the reorganization and strengthening of the Ministry of Public
Works, Construction and Urban Development (HOPCU) (para 3.01). More
specifically, project financing supporteds rehabllitation of 200 km of
paved roads and about 300 km of unpaved roadsg and establishment of routine
road maintenance capacity and .n adequate system of road user charges and
road maintenance financing. Considerable training, technical assistance
and some equipment were also financed under the project (para 3.02).
Implementation Experience
2.        IDA and Special Fund credits were both approved on May 8, 1984,
declared effective on December 13, 1984 and closed on January 12, 1990 and
May 8, 1989, respectively. The original closing date for both credits was
June 30, 1990. Funds have been virtually fully disbursed under the
credits. There were two main variances in   lect implementation: V?) the
rehabilitation of paved roads by contract _aead of by force account as
under the previous project; and (b) a redefinLtion of project scope to take
account of prolonged suspension of parallel financing from the Kuwait Fund
(IF) (para 5.01).
3.        There was not expected to be a break in the operations of the
three force account brigades, or the technical assistance team between the
First and Second Roads Project. However, 95Z of the equipment purchased
earlier were found immobilized at project start-up. There was a virtual
breakdown in project management and equipment maintenance. Purthermore,
disbursements from the IF were suspended for some 23 months due to arrears
problems with the Government soon after the IF credit became effective on
January 6, 1986. There was also a countrywide shortage of fuel which
affected operations of the equipment. Project emphasis had to be redefined
and adjustments made to utilize IDA and Special Fund Credits first,
(including funds under a Reconstruction Import Credit II Project (RIC I).
Project activities financed by the RF will be ongoing for another two years
(paras 5.02 and 5.03).
Proiect Results
4.        In respect of the physical components, almost 100S of the
targets attainable using IDA Credits only were completed.  This is after a
crash repair program for the equipment was launched; problems of
procurement and rebuilding most of the departmental forces were overcome;



- iv -
adjustments were made to include works preriously carried out under tha
First Roads Project (due to maintenance problems), and an agreement reached
to undertake rehabilitation for paved roads by contract instead of by force
account (paras 6.02 and 6.03). The physical components completed under the
project will contribute to a more efficient and cost-effective transport
system that will permit a higher level of economic activity in Guinea-
Bissau (para 6.09). The weighted average economic rate of teturn (ERR) for
rehabilitation of both paved and unpaved roads financed by the IDA and
Special Fund Credits is 44 percent (para3 6.10-6.13).
S.        On the institutional side, with the help of technical
assistance, the project achieved its objective of assisting with the
reorganization of MOPCU which included merging the Project Unit, under the
First Roads Project, within the Ministry (para 4.02). A Road Fund was
established, a cost accounting and budgeting system put in place, but
act!ns were not taken by the Government to increase revenues to about
US$1.7 million estimated at the time of appraisal for road maintenance by
end-1988. Only US$.3 million equivalent or 13Z was generated under the
Fund. Training as envisaged under the project did not f'illy materialize
due to frequent. suspension of disbursements by the Kuwait Fund (paras 6.04
and 6.07).
Sustainability
6.        The framework for sustainability was put in place:  the
establishment of the Road Fund, effective reorganization of directorates
now under the MOPCU and the establishment of streamlined cost accounting
and budgeting systems. However, given the failure of government to
implement measures to effectively increase revenues, and the failure to
carry out training as envisaged under the project (partly attributable to a
redirection of project emphasis early in implementation), sustainability is
questionable. However these shortcomings are intended to be given highest
priority in an ongoing follow-up operation (Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project), which includei a timetable of covenanted agreements to generate
increased revenues to cover the longer term cost of road maintenance (paras
7.01 and 7.02).
Lessons Learned
7.        The important lessons to be learned from this operation aret
(a) in cases where there could be a risk of suspension of disbursements,
care should be taken to ensure that items financed by other donors are not
critical for the implementation of IDA-financed components; (b) force
account brigades should be relied on only to undertake minimal road
maintenance. Rehabilitation and even routine maintenance should be done on
a contract basis; and (c) non-resident management of technical assistance
needs to be avoided for the supervision of works particularly executed by
departmental forces, and particularly in countries like Guinea-Bissau where
counterpart staff is thin and often inadequately trained. Adequate
accommodation should be provided under the project if necessary to assure
this.

Sub-sector:           Transport
2. Background
2.01      Guinea-Bissau is a small country on the West African coast
between Senegal and Guinea with an estimated population of about 810,000 at
the time of appraisal. The country covers an area of 36,135 km2. The
territory is generally flat with a few hills and a coastline interrupted by
seven large estuaries which run far inland, and along which most
inhabitants live. Road and river transport are highly interdependent since
there is insufficient traffic to justify construction of bridges.
2.02      The national surface network comprises: (a) 2,300 km of roads,
of which 485 km are paved, some 412 km are all-weather laterite roads, and
the remainder are earth and rural roads; and (b) a deepwater port at Bissau
and about 27 small coastal and river ports located in the islands and along
the main estuaries and rivers. The extent of the road network is
considered in general adequate to meet the country's needs. However,
maintenance is inadequate and there is a considerable backlog of
rehabilitation work.
2.03      Transport planning is principally the responsibility of the
Ministry of Transport and Tourism (MTT), with the Ministry of Public Works,
Construction, and Urban Development (MOPCU), playing a subsidiary role and
the Secretariat of State for Planning acting in a coordinating capacity.
The Directorate of Land Transport (DTT), a part of MTT, is responsible for
administration of the subsector. The transport sector suffers from a lack
of qualified staff generally and particularly at the middle level,
inadequate coordination between the Ministries and public agencies
concerned, overstaffing in many areas compounded by little working
equipment or recurrent budget. A general transport study completed in 1980
identified investment priorities in the sector, and provided useful
recommendations on institutional reforms necessary to increase efficiency.
The Government has undertaken to reorganize MOPCU.
2.04      In keeping with the Government's strategy in the transport
sector, IDA assistance has concentrated on urgently required rehabilitation
and maintenance of roads in the First Roads Project (Cr. 878-GUB, approved
in FY79 for US$9 million, equivalent). The Second Roads Project continued



thi emphasis in order to address the poor state of transport
infrastructure which is a major constraint to Guinea-Bissau's economic
development.
3. ProJect Objectives and Description
3.01      Prolect Obiectives.  The Second Roads Project was intended to:
(i) continue the road rehabilitation program; (ii) establish a routine
maintenance capacity within HOPCU; (iii) improve ferry operations; (iv)
strengthen sector institutions and operations; and (v) establish an
adequate system of road user charges and road maintenance financing.
3.02      Project Description.  The project was originally designed to be
implemented over the period 1984-1990 and to finance the following
components:
(a) rehabilitation of about 200 km of paved roads and about 300
km of unpaved roads;
(b) establishment of a routine road maintenance capacity at
regional depots;
(c)  training for all levels of MOPCU staff;
(d) equipment and assistance to MOPCU for ferry operations;
te) assistance to MOPCU for general management, public
accounting, urban planning and the laboratory; and
tf)  assistance to DTT within MTT for axle load control and road
signing.
4. Proiect Design and Organization
4.01      The project was designed as a direct follow-up to the First
Roads Project to finance in effect the second tranche to further improve
road rehabilitation, build up a road maintenance capacity to reduce the
backlog of periodic maintenance, and to continue support for technical
assistance and training. The method of approach was to continue with the
use of force account brigades for the physical components of the project.
Justification for the use of brigades under a second operation was
supported by the fact that Guinea-Bissau had no local road construction
industry and, at the time of appraisal of the FIrst Roads Project, it was
virtually impossible to attract contractors for relatively small works
under difficult conditions prevailing in the country. Furthermore, the
existing brigades had proven their ability to carry out satisfactory work.
However, to guard against an excessive build-up of equipment, brigades
would be provided with the minimum equipment required, which would then be
applied to routine maintenance leaving no obstacle to the ir.troduction of
periodic maintenance by contract under a future operation.
4.02      The project supported institutional strengthening of the MOPCU,
which included merging the Project Unit established under the First Roads



- g -
Project with the Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DEP), and upgrading the
DEP into a General Directorate under the reorganized MOPCU which would
benefit from administrative, accounting, budgeting and personnel management
systems. The rehabilitation brigades under the First Roads Project would
also be integrated under the DEP. At the time of negotiations the project
also provided for technical assistance to support the operations of the
laboratory and for urban planning within the HOPCU.
4.03      The project concept was clearly understood by all parties
concerned. To the extent that the Second Roads Project is a continuation
of the rehabilitation program begun earlier, this project cannot be
considered to be innovative. However, the establishment of a Road Fund,
essentially as a financial entity under MOPCU, to ensure the longer term
financing for road maintenance in a timely manner, can be considered an
important element introduced towards achieving the goals of the transport
sector. It was also envisaged that the Road Fund would eventually lead to
an autonomous Highway Authority.
4.04      The total cost of the project for the original implementation
period (1984-1990) was estimated at US$13.8 million equivalent net of
taxes. The project would be financed by IDA, the KF and the Government.
IDA and Special Fund credits would finance 58Z of the cost (net of taxes),
the KF 37Z, and the Government the remaining 52 1/. The IDA and Special
Fund Credits, originally scheduled to close on June 30, 1990, was actually
closed on January 12, 1990, and May 8, 1989, respectively--the date of last
disbursements.
5.        Proiect Implementation
5.01      The critical variances during implementation are:  (a) the
rehabilitation of paved roads by contract instead of by force accounts and
(b) a redefinition of project scope to, inter alia, take account of the
suspension in parallel financing from the KF.
5.02      Neither of the above two factors could have been anticipated at
the time of apprqisal. In respect of (a) above, about one year after
project effectiveness it was determined that the minimum requirements to
start implementation of the project did not exist. That is, 952 of the
equipment purchased for the brigades under the first project (which were to
be used under the second project with some additional equipment) were
immobilized primarily because project management and thus equipment
maintenance broke down during the gap of about 15 months between the first
and second roads project. It was therefore evident that the basic
organizational structure for the effective operation of the brigades would
need considerable rebuilding. Technical assistance was therefore
reorganized in two teams, one focussing on the organization and supervision
of the force account brigades and another on strengthening the overall
Directorate of Public Works. Perhaps because of IDA-supported macro-

- 4 -
economic reforms being carried out in 1986--liberalizing trade and
commercial activities--, Guinea-Bissau was able to attract bidders on an
international competitive bidding (ICB) basis for rehabilitation work.
contracts.
5.03       In respect of (b) above, the KF suspended disbursements for a
total of some 23 months beginning in about the second year of the project
because of arrears problems (outside the project) with the Government of
Guinea Bissau. Adjustments were therefore made to first utilize funds from
IDA and Special Fund Credits (as well as from a Reconstruction Import
Credit (RIC II) project (Cr. 1531-GUB) approved December 1984, para 6.01).
Activities financed by the KF will be ongoing for another two years.
Equipment, spare parts and fuel purchased early iu the project under the RF
loan were eventually cancelled. The period of arrears also coincided with
a shortage of fuel throughout the country.
5.04      Durinig the course of early .plementation, because of the misuse
of project resources, the Project Director and supporting staff were
replaced after an audit was done. The replacement of project management
contributed to delays in project activities, but this was quickly overcome.
5.05      At appraisal there were few risks associated with the physical
implementation of the project as there was not expected to be a break in
the operations of the brigades or the technical assistance team. Effective
implementation of technical assistance began about a year after planned
with adveree consequences for the project, particularly in a country like
Guinea-Bissau where counterpart staff is already thin and training is often
inadequate
6. Project Results
6.01      Despite the problem of parallel financing with the KP (para
5.03), the project was able to complete almost all the physical targets
that could be financed using IDA and Special Fund credits only, and by
agreeing with the Government to allocate under RIC II an amount of
US$200,000 to help purchase fuel for rehabilitation works for the force
account brigade. Although emphasis was placed early in the project on
those components where progress had already been made, important
achievements were made on the institutional aspects of the project, though
not to the extent as previously planned.
6.02      Physical components:  It was agreed with the Governments of
Guinea-Bissau and Kuwait, that rehabilitation of the 200 km of paved roads
would be awarded to private contractors: the KF to finance 111 km under
separate contract and IDA and Special Fund Credits to finance about 90 km
following ICB process. The IDA portion is 1001 complete. Rehabilitation
of unpaved roads was undertaken by force account as planned with IDA
Credits financing 100? of its portion (111 km) of the 300 km. Routine
maintenance estimated to be carried out through 1989 on all paved roads
(460 km) is virtually complete (450 km or 97X). Maintenance on gravel
roads is about 54? complete (200 km of an estimated 370 km). Spot
improvements have been done with respect to maintenance of earth roads; 400
km was estimated to have received routine maintenance by end-1989.



6.03      The above was accomplished after adjustments were made in the
project to concentrate first on a crash repair of equipment before
purchase in order to restore most of the brigades in a phased manner.
(Three brigades were originally established under the First Roads Project).
Furthermore, because of the breakdown in project management--contributed in
large measure by the fact that the Project Director of the technical
assistance team was resident in Dakkar and therefore not svailable to deal
with problems on a day-to-day basis--portions of the rehabilitation works
undertaken under the fhrst operation had to be included under the Second
Roads Project. Because of the living conditions in Guinea-Bissau and the
lack of adequate accommodation, it has often proved difficult to attract
resident technical assistance. Accommodation for technical assistance
appointed under the project was provided through housing facilities
financed under an ongoing IDA-funded Ports project.
6.04      The Road Fund.  The Road Fund was established by Decree 19/84
and many of the administrative actions specified for its implementation
were put into effect, albeit at a slower pace than originally planned. Key
actions included: (a) the merger of the Project Unit established under the
First Roads Project within the reorganized !OPCU; and (b) establishment of
a satisfactory cost accounting and budgeting system with technical
assistance. However, counterpart staff will continue to need training and
support beyond this project to fully implement the system. Revenues
generated under the Fund (about USS.3 million equivalent), fall far short
of what was estimated at the time of appraisal (about US$1.7 million
equivalent) to finance road rehabilitation at end-1988. Supervision
missions urged the Government to increase revenues by raising charges and
implementing the provisions of the Decree, but without success.
6.05      Ferry Operations.  A 20-ton ferry was delivered as planned under
the project, and minor repairs were carried out to make operational most of
the ferries in the fleet.
6.06      Road Safety Program.  The project made little impact in
strengthening the Directorate of Land Transport to adequately address the
road safety program as envisaged under the project. Technical assistance
for this component arrived much later than planned.
6.07      Technical Assistance and Training.  Although this component
cannot be considered a failure, it did not achieve the full objectives as
originally envisaged under the project. Emphasis was redirected in the
early years of the project towards reorganizing, supervising and training
the force account brigades. Technical assistance was provided under
various departments of the HOPCU (some later than planned) but only limited
training was carried out for the majority of staff in the reorganized
MOPCU. Technical assistance which was added to the project at the time of
negotiations for strengthening MOPCU's laboratory for road maintenance was
carried out satisfactorily; the laboratory is now operational for both soil
and concrete testing although some equipment and considerable training are
still required. A free-standing, technical assistance program for the
Department of Urban Planning, as requested at negotiations, was determined



to be untimely taking into account the absorptive capacity of the
department; assistance was scaled down.
6.08      Proiect Costs. Actual project costs total US$14.6 million
equivalent (net of taxes), of whicn foreign costs amount to about US$14
million equivalent or about 962 of total costs. This compares to total
project costs at appraisal of US$13.8 million equlvalent (net of taxes),
with foreign costs estimated at US$11.8 million equivalent, or 862 of total
costs. Actual costs reflect exchange r*te adjustments and the assumption
that the Kuwait Fund, which will be ongoing for another two years due to
prolonged periods of suspension of disbursements caused by arrears problems
with the Government of Guinea-Bissau, will eventually disburse the full
amount of its loan. Adjustments were also made to the Kuwait financing to
reflect reduced equipment costs as the works component would be mostly
carried out by contract. Funds have been almost fully disbursed under the
IDA and Special Fund Credits--US$327 equivalent and US$3,269 equivalent are
being cancelled from the IDA and Special Fund Credits, respectively
(Annexes 3 and 4).
6.09      Economic Re-evaluation.  The project made possible critically-
needed rehabilitation of the country's road network, removing physical
bottlenecks in the movement of goods and people, reducing vehicle operating
costs (voc) and overall transport costs, thus facilitating the country's
economic recovery. It also enabled strengthening of sector institutions
for planning, monitoring and project implementation, and helped set up a
framework for systematic routine maintenance. Many of these significant
project benefits are, however, difficult to quantify.
6.10      The present economic analysis is limited to IDA and Special Fund
components (excluding Kuwait Fund components which are still in progress).
The total cost for IDA and Special Fund Credits was US$9.4 million
equivalent, of which US$4.5 million was for technical assistance. The
economic benefit for technical assistance could not be quantified, though
it supported the project objectives of strengthening institutions in the
sector. A reassessment of the Economic Rates of Return (ERR) from the
total road related components is summarized below.
6.11      The total cost of all road related components was US$4.9 million
equivalent, including rehabilitation of paved roads by contract (US$2.1
million) and rehabilitetion of unpaved roads by force account at an
estimated cost of US$1.0 million. The remaining US$1.8 million wad mainly
for routine maintenance, by way of equipment, materials and labor costs.
ERR estimates from road rehabilitation were obtained through the Highway
Design and Maintenan-e Standards Model (HDM). Detailed results are given
in Annex 5 and a summary is given below:
(a) Rehabilitation of paved roads by contract:
ERR - 432
(b) Rehabilitation of unpaved roads by force accounts
ERR - 352



6.12      No separste estimate of benefits from routine maintenance has
been done for the PCR. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) had estimated the
ERR for this component to be very high at 1371. Experience elsewhere
confirms that routine maintenance yields very high returns of such
magnitude. since lack of routine maintenance will result in very high voc
and will require more expensive road reconstruction works to correct the
damage. We assume a conservative 502 ERR for this component.
6.13      The weighted average ERR from all road related components of
this project amounts to about 44 percent.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.01      The framework for sustainability was put in place: the
establishment of the Road Fund, effective reorganization of directorates
now under MOPCU and the establishment of streamlined cost accounting and
budgeting systems. However, given the failure of government to implement
the provisions of the Decree to increase revenues to cover at minimum the
cost of road maintenance, and the failure to carry out training as
envisaged (partly attributable to a redirection in project emphasis early
in implementation), project sustainability is indeed questionable.
7.02      To the extent that agreements made under a follow-up operation
(Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (IRP), Cr. 2074-GUB, approved
December 1989, effective June 5, 19901. will be implemented, then the
sustainability of routine and, periodic road maintenance is still
achievable. Under IRP the Government agreed to increase revenues by: (a)
raising the tax on the c.i.f price of gasoline from 5 to 20? by December
1990; (b) increasing the circulation tax and adjusting it quarterly to
reflect inflation as indicated by the national bank; and (c) replacing road
and bridge tolls with a quarterly tax on diesel powered road vehicles to be
updated quarterly to reflect inflation. The training program begun under
the Second Roads Project will be continued under IRP.
8. The Association's Performance
8.01      This project was a continuation of the works begun under the
First Roads Project. In retrospect, by assuming that there would be no
break in operations of the force account brigade (para 5.05), the appraisal
team failed to evaluate the prevailing condition of the road network at
project start-up. Horeover, the assumption of the continued use of non-
resident technical assistance from the first operation should have been
questioned as the relations between the technical assistance team and the
Borrower were apparently less than fully satisfactory.
8.02      Given the above, and the fact that the project was faced in its
early stages with exogenous factors--suspension of co-financing funds due
to arrears and countrywide shortage of fuel--the supervision team did a
commendable job in redefining the project scope and reallocating IDA,
Special Fund Credits and RIC II funds to finance about half of the physical
project objectives and almost 100? of the targets attainable using
resources frsm the above IDA Credits only. It is therefore understandable,
though regrettable, that all the objectives of institutional strengthening



-8-
and training were not fully implemented as envisaged under the project.
The training program begun under the Second Roads Project will be continued
under IRP and will be given greater emphasis.
9. Dorrower's Performance
9.01      It is difficult not to place responsibility on the Borrower for
the virtual iL1ncbilization of the equipment purchased under the First Roads
Project--sufficient to equip three brigades--which were also intended to be
used under the Second Roads Project. The state of immobilization was not
just due to a In,:,: of spare parts, but basic care which even minimal
supervision in     `'seace of on-site technical assistance could have
avoided.  Thf       z t did, however, overcome these problems and with a new
and resident i      cal assistance team and project management, important
objectives we- acj,iaved. Closer supervision of the Project Director first
appointed to the e 3ject might have avoided misuse of IDA resources and
subsequent delays In project activities. Although initial counterpart
funds were provided ±n a timely manner it is disappointing that action was
not taken to generate more than 18Z of the road funds estimated to be
required at end-1988.
10. Project Relationship
10.01     IDA's relationship with the Government, Kuwait Fund and
consultants/contractors was good despite challenging circumstances at
times. The Borrower's relationship with the new technical assistance team
was also very good.
11.  Proiect Documentation and File
11.01     Project documentation on file (SAR, legal agreements, project
management report, correspondence file and supervision reports) and
interviews with staff involved with the history of the project helped
provide a good basis for writing the PCR.
11.02     Legal documents dealt adequately with the issues at the time of
appraisal. Documentation on file did not include a systematic review of
the status of covenants. This will be avoided in the future with the new
reporting requirements of supervision missions.

PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The PCR was prepared by the Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), whlich sent the PCR to the
Borrower for completion of Part II. No reply has been received.
