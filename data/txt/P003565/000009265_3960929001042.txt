MEMORAPDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 44.4 MWLLION
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE SUANGUAI METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recounendation on a proposed credit to
China for SDR 44.4 million ($60 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be under standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.
It would be used to finance urban transport facilities and provide technical
assistance to strengthen planning and management in the urban transport sub-
sector. The proposed onlending terms between the Ministry of Financ.. and the
Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG) would be 20 years including five years'
grace at 1.9 percent interest per year with 0.75 percent per year commitment
fee on outstanding balance. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by SMG.
2.        Background.  The urban sector in China has experienced unprecedented
growth since 1979, when urban econoire reforms were first introduced.
Although constrained by recent controls oi capital investment and counter-
inflationary measures imposed by the central government, urban economic devel-
opment continues and city populations are swelling with increasing numbers of
migrant workers seeking off-farm employment. More than 5 million persons are
estimated to join the urban ranks in China eac.. year. Declining levels of
service, despite rising expectations, and backlogs in providing public service
to industry and households are major issues facing China's urban managers.
3.        The substantial infrastructure needs and severe resource constraints
facing China's central and local governments call for a well focused assis-
tance strategy. In response, the Association has adopted a strategy which
involves* (a) introducing tools to tdefine investment priorities; (b) utiliz-
ing existing facilities more effectitely; (c) making sector planning and man-
agement more demand-responsive; (d) encouraging greater cost recovery from
users of public utility services; and le) putting into operation environmental
resource management in urban areas. Following these objectives, studies were
carried out during 1988 and 1989, with assistance from the French Consultant
Trust Funds and the U.S. Trade and Development Program, to develop strategies
for resolving urban transport problems in the Shanghai Metropolitan Region.
These studies identified a program of investments for urban transport Improve-
ment, as well as important institutional strengthening work in line with the
Association's adopted strategy.
4.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  This would be the
first urban transport project in China supported by the Association. Two
previous projects, Medium-Sized Cities Development (Loan 3286/Credit 2201) and
Liaoning Urban Infrastructure (Loan 2219), include urban transport components
but since they were approved only in December 1990 and February 1991, respec-
tively, little experienci has been gained on implementation. Experience on
the Shanghai Sewerage Protect (Loan 2794/Credit 1779), which also involves
major construction in urban Shanghai, has been good and this is attributed to
sound preparation and strong management. These two elements have been
stressed in the preparation and design of this project with substantial tech-
nical assistance provided during project preparation and also allocated for



-2-
project implementation, including components for project management support
and construction oupervision.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  A significant contribution of the
Association's participation in the preparation of an urban transport invest-
ment program In Shanghai has been balancing the emphasis on various modes of
traffic, including nonmotorized vehicle tMQV) routes, and on prioritiaation of
investments. The emphasis placed on seeking alternative low-cost options has
In the short run enabled the Shanghai authorities to save or defer more than
$500 million on large urban transport investments and stressed the setting of
priorities in the analysis of the urban transport investmeut program. The
immediate Shanghai transport problem arises partly from the need to make up
for decades of neglected investment in infrastructure. The Bsank Group can
assist Shanghai in modernizing its approach to urban transport planning and
implementation, and in fiscal planning to achieve affordable development. A
finer definition of urban transport investment priorities will require use of
well-adapted traffic models, improved area expansion plans, NKV routes, light
rail systems, and combined transport development with land development or
redevelopment. IDA has extensive experience in these fields and can help
Shanghai tap other international experience that might not be directly acces-
sible to it.
6.        Prolact Obiectives.  The principal objective cJf the project is to
provide the basis for developing an efficient urban transport system in
Shanghai. In order to achieve this objective, the project is designed to
increase capacity, reduce congestion, and improve efficiency of the transport
networks and to improve the planning, programming, finance, and management of
tQe urban transport system in Shanghai. The project would represent the first
stage of a long-term program intended to upgrade and develop the urban trans-
port infrastructure of Shanghai in order to meet the demands generated by
modernization of the local economy.
7.        Prolect Description.  This project represents the first investment
slice of priority works intended to upgrade and develop the urban transport
infrastructure of the Shanghai Metropolitan Region (population 13 million).
It Involves: (a) construction of a 5.5 km viaduct over Zhongshan Road, with
surface road improvements underneath and to the north and south of the via-
duct; (b) traffic management and safety including the introduction of a 1.1 km
of busway along the Bund and 19 km of NKV roads; and (c) technical assistance
to strengthen the mmnicipality's capabilities for planning and implementing
urban transportation measures, effecting improvements in traffic and safety,
and improving bus operations. Resettlement of about 2,150 households and
about 200 enterprises would be required. The project is expected to 1 com-
pleted by June 30, 1997. The total cost of the project is estimated at $148.3
million, with a foreign exchange component of $69.4 million (47 percent).
Provision has been made for retroactive financing of Civil Works on account of
payments made for expenditures after July 1, 1990, up to the date of the
agreement, but not to exceed SDR 2.9 million ($3.9 million equivalent). The
financing plan and estimate of costs are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the schedule of disbursements are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of iank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  Staff Appraisal Report No. 8465-CHA  dated August 12, 1991, is
being distributed separately.



S.        Zuvironmental Impact.  The Project is expected to have a positive
environmental impact due to net reductions in engine emissions (associated
with higher vehicle speeds), reduced traffic accidents, and improved housing
and sanitation conditions for families relocated under the Project.
9.        Agreed Actions.  The Shanghai Municipal Government has agreed, inter
alla, on the following actious, (a) to furnish to the Association, commencing
June 30, 1992, details of the municipality's medium-term transportation
investment plan and subsequent annual investment plani, for the Association's
review and comments until completion of the project; (b) to carry out the
resettlement of the people affected by the project, in accordance with the
plan agreed with the Association, including the various steps to be taken and
the schedule for resettlement monitoring and reporting to the Association: (c)
to maintain the Project Implementation Unit with the necessary staffing and
responsibilities satisfactory to the Association; and (d) to furnish the Asso-
ciation, not later than January 1, 1992, the arrangements for coordinating,
planning and implementing the Traffic Safety and Management Program.
10.       Benefits.  The project would alleviate traffic congestlon and
improve road safety in the Shanghai Metropolitan Region. The improvements
financed through this project directly address the most serious traffic pzob-
lems in the inner city. Benefits would accrue from savings in vehicle operat-
ing costs, personal savings associated with shorter travel time, and reduction
in accident costs, with an internal economic rate of return (ERR) estimated at
18 percent for the Zhongshan Road investments and 32 percent for the Inner
City Road improvements.
11.       Risks.  Project risks mainly involve delays in the construction of
the Zhongshan viaduct and the needed demolition and resettlement. The land
needed for resettlement is already available to the agencies concerned. The
agencies responsible for demolition and resettlement have a great deal of
experience in this area, and resettlement for this project would be included
as a small part of Shanghai's already ongoing resettlement program. Given the
record of the Shanghai Municipal Government in major projects involving sub-
stantial demolition and resettlement, the risks are judged to be small.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would com-
ply with the Articles of Agreement of the Associaticot and I recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
