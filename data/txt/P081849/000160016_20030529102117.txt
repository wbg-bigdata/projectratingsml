Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
through 
strengthening 
elements 
of 
the 
policy, 
institutional, 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
the 
competitive 
provision 
of 
telecommunications 
infrastructure 
and 
services. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
by: 
(a) 
separating 
the 
policy 
and 
operational roles 
of 
the government 
in 
the 
sector 
by 
restructuring 
the 
Bangladesh 
Telegraph 
and Telephone 
Board 
(BTTB) 
to 
operate 
on 
a 
commercial 
basis; 
(b) 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
function 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Post 
and 
Telecommunications 
(MOPT); 
and 
(c) 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory capacity 
of 
the Bangladesh 
Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
period, 
it 
is 
envisaged that 
there 
will 
be 
a clear 
separation 
in 
the 
operational 
and 
policy 
roles 
of 
the 
government 
and 
that 
BTRC's 
capacity 
to effectively 
regulate a 
competitive 
telecommunications 
sector 
would 
be 
improved. 
The 
project 
objective 
is 
to improve 
the 
performance 
of 
Bangladesh's 
telecommunications 
sector 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
will 
include 
the 
following:

Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
21326-BD 
The 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
CAS 
objective 
of 
accelerating 
and broadening 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
by 
supporting governmental 
efforts to 
remove 
structural 
impediments 
and 
establish a 
conducive environment 
for 
private 
investment. 
The project 
will 
assist 
in 
enabling 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
through 
regulatory and structural 
reform 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
It 
will 
promote 
competition 
and 
private participation 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
telecommunications 
services 
by 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
a 
sound 
policy, 
legal, 
regulatory, 
and 
institutional 
sector 
framework. 
This 
will 
facilitate 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
more 
efficient 
delivery 
of 
services 
resulting 
in 
a 
reduction 
in 
costs 
for 
other 
sectors; 
and 
also 
establish a 
level 
playing 
field for 
all 
operators. 
The 
project 
is 
also 
in 
line 
with 
the 
CAS 
strategy 
of 
being 
responsive 
to 
Government 
initiatives 
and opportunistic

The 
project 
also supports 
the 
Government's 
Interim 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) 
pillar 
of 
accelerating pro-poor growth, through 
substantial expansion 
of 
the 
capacity 
and

of 
infrastructure 
services, 
including 
telecommunications, 
which 
serve 
as 
an 
important 
backbone 
of 
a 
growing 
economy. 
The project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
Group's 
Information 
and 
Communications 
Technologies 
(ICT) 
Sector Strategy 
(April 
2002), 
which 
calls for:

The 
MOPT 
is 
the 
government 
ministry 
responsible 
for 
formulating 
the 
government's 
policy for 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
The 
National 
Telecommunications 
Policy 
of 
1998 
is 
currently 
being 
implemented. 
The 
telecommunications 
sector 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
governed 
by 
the 
Bangladesh 
Telecommunication 
Act, 
2001. 
The 
law 
provides 
an 
adequate 
framework 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
workable 
regulatory 
regime. 
Through 
enactment 
of 
this 
legislation, 
the 
Government 
created 
the 
BTRC, 
which 
resulted 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
regulatory functions 
from 
MOPT 
to 
BTRC, 
and 
the 
Government 
appointed 
the 
chairman 
and commissioners 
of 
BTRC 
to 
start 
operation 
on 
January 
3 
1, 
2002. 
BTRC 
is 
responsible 
for 
regulating 
the 
sector 
in 
keeping 
with 
both 
the 
Act 
and telecommunications 
policy 
as 
determined 
by 
MOPT. 
It 
is 
responsible 
for 
licensing 
operators and 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
license 
terms 
and 
conditions; managing 
the 
radio 
spectrum; 
ensuring 
technical 
compatibility 
and 
effective 
interconnection 
between 
service 
providers; 
monitoring 
carrier 
quality 
of 
service; 
approving tariffs; 
and 
providing 
equipment 
type 
approval. 
The 
incumbent 
monopoly 
operator 
is 
the 
government-owned 
BTTB, 
established 
by 
the 
1979 
BTTB 
Ordinance 
No. 
XII, 
to 
function 
under 
the 
MOPT. 
This 
ordinance 
was amended 
in 
1995, 
to 
create 
the 
Telecommunications Regulatory 
Board 
(TRB) 
also 
functioning 
under 
the 
MOPT. 
TRB 
was 
the 
precursor 
to 
BTRC. 
BTTB 
has 
been 
operating 
as 
a 
GOB 
department. 
BTTB's 
management 
board 
consists 
of 
a Chairman, 
four 
full 
time 
members 
and 
three 
part 
time 
members, 
all 
of 
whom 
are 
appointed 
by 
the 
Government. 
The 
MOPT 
reviews 
BTTB's 
annual development 
plans, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF) 
approves 
the 
financing 
plan 
and 
allocates 
funds. 
The 
Planning Commission 
approves 
the 
Annual 
Development 
Plan 
and allocates 
capital 
development 
funds 
for 
BTTB. 
BTTB 
has 
a 
de 
facto 
monopoly 
on 
domestic 
fixed-line 
public 
telephony and a 
de 
jure 
monopoly 
over 
international 
telephony. 
The 
telecommunications 
sector 
in 
Bangladesh 
has 
limited 
competition, 
with 
four 
licensed 
private 
sector 
mobile 
operators 
and a 
number 
of 
value 
added service 
providers, 
including 
Internet 
Service 
Providers 
(ISPs). 
The 
mobile 
operators 
are 
directly 
responsible 
for 
72 
percent 
of 
all 
new 
lines 
in 
service since 1996. 
Grameen 
Phone, 
the largest 
mobile 
operator 
leases 
capacity 
from 
Bangladesh 
Railways' fiber optic network 
and provides 
nationwide 
mobile 
services. 
Main 
sector 
issues. 
The 
performance 
of 
the 
Bangladesh telecommunications 
sector 
has 
fallen 
far 
short 
of 
its 
potential 
and 
remains a 
significant constraint 
to 
economic 
growth. 
The 
main 
sector 
issues 
can 
be 
classified 
under 
two 
broad 
categories: 
(a) 
poor 
sector 
performance, and 
(b) 
weak 
competition 
and 
private 
investment 
environment. 
These issues 
are 
further 
discussed 
in 
the 
following 
sections. 
Poor 
sector 
performance. 
Despite 
being 
the 
first 
country 
in 
the 
region 
to 
license 
private 
operators 
to 
provide 
services 
in 
1989, 
Bangladesh lags 
behind 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
South 
Asia 
region, 
both 
in 
the 
coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
telecommunications 
services 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
indicators

This 
poor 
performance 
can 
be 
evidenced 
by 
a 
number 
of 
factors: 
e 
Limited 
access 
to 
telecommunications 
services. 
The overall 
level 
of 
teledensity 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
very 
low 
at 
approximately 
0.83 
lines 
per 
hundred 
persons 
compared 
to 
an international 
low 
income 
group 
average 
of 
4.00 
lines 
per 
hundred 
persons. 
This 
low 
level 
of 
teledensity 
reflects 
the 
failure 
of 
initiatives to 
attract the 
private 
investment 
needed 
for 
the 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
the 
poor 
performance 
of 
the 
dominant 
operator 
BTTB 
to 
meet 
customers’ demand. 
BTTB’s 
capacity 
limitations 
constrain 
supply 
within 
the 
overall 
sector. 
Despite 
high 
fixed-line 
connection 
charges 
(only 
recently reduced 
to 
approximately 
USS150 
from 
approximately 
US$350) 
BTTB 
cannot 
keep 
up 
with 
demand, 
and installation 
wait 
times 
average 
several years. 
Capacity 
constraints 
similarly 
affect interconnection 
for 
mobile 
operators, 
who 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
adequate 
interconnection, 
offer 
mobile-to-mobile 
only 
services 
for 
a 
majority 
of 
their 
customers 
and 
are 
unable 
to 
expand 
services 
in 
line 
with 
growth 
in 
demand. 
The 
results 
are (a) 
a 
significant 
unmet 
demand 
for 
basic 
telephone 
lines, 
estimated 
at 
about 
3.5 
million 
immediately, 
growing 
to 
10 
million 
within 
three 
years; 
and 
(b) 
inadequate 
fixed-line national 
and 
international 
services. 
e 
Low 
rural 
teledensity: 
Although 
approximately 
80 
percent 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
population 
resides 
in 
rural 
areas, access 
to 
services 
in 
these 
areas 
is 
limited. 
Non-Dhaka 
and 
rural 
teledensity 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
only 
about 
0.19 
lines 
per 
hundred 
persons. 
At 
present, 
the 
two 
private 
rural 
fixed-line 
operators 
provide 
only 
about 
26,000 
main 
lines 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Telecommunication 
services 
provided 
by 
cellular 
companies 
are 
not 
accessible 
to 
most 
of 
the 
rural 
population. 
Although 
some 
cellular 
operators 
like 
Grameen 
Phone have 
initiated 
a 
village 
phone 
program to 
bring 
connectivity 
to rural 
areas, 
less 
than one-third 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
68,000 
villages 
have 
access 
to 
phones. 
Given 
the 
economic importance 
of 
access 
to 
rural 
communities and 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
rural 
provision, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
public 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
intervention 
to 
promote 
access 
in 
rural 
areas.

e 
Poor 
performance 
of 
BTTB. 
The 
government-owned and 
controlled 
incumbent 
operator 
BTTB 
has 
not 
improved 
its 
performance 
despite 
substantial 
public 
investments 
in 
the 
organization. 
It 
continues 
to 
operate 
under 
a 
protective regime 
with 
little 
accountability 
to 
both 
its 
owners 
and 
customers. 
For 
example, 
as 
an 
indicator 
of 
efficiency, 
the 
BTTB 
has 
approximately 
29 
lines 
per 
employee 
(in 
2002), 
compared 
to 
the 
international 
low 
income group 
average 
of 
69 
lines 
per 
employee. 
BTTB 
has 
found 
it 
difficult 
to improve efficiency 
in 
an environment 
where 
it 
has: 
(a) 
faced 
limited 
competition, 
(b) 
needed 
to 
follow 
civil 
service procedures 
for 
staffing 
and 
procurement, 
and 
(c) 
had 
inadequate 
access 
to capital. 
BTTB, 
in 
its 
current 
structure, 
lacks 
the 
resources--financial, technical, 
human 
resources--and 
the 
autonomy 
to 
achieve 
its 
target 
of 
meeting 
demand. 
It 
has 
very 
limited 
decision 
making 
authority and 
needs 
MOF 
and 
MOPT 
approval 
for 
most 
investments 
and 
general expenditures. 
This 
has 
led 
to 
limited 
service 
availability, lack 
of 
new 
product 
rollout 
and generally 
poor 
service 
quality. 
Competition 
is 
also 
growing 
in 
several 
forms: 
mobile 
telephony 
is 
creating 
a 
viable 
substitute 
for 
BTTB’s 
services, 
voice-over 
Internet 
protocol 
(VOIP) 
(authorized 
or 
unauthorized) 
and 
falling 
international 
settlement rates 
have eroded 
BTTB’s 
highly 
profitable international 
monopoly. 
As 
BTTB 
lacks 
the 
autonomy 
and 
incentive to productively 
invest 
its 
profits 
back 
into 
building 
its 
network, 
national 
infrastructure and 
sector 
performance 
is 
crippled 
and 
this 
reduces 
the 
value 
of 
BTTB 
as 
a government 
asset. 
Competition 
and 
private 
investment 
environment. 
Many 
factors can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
low 
level 
of 
private 
investment 
in 
the 
sector. 
In 
general, 
there 
are 
inadequate 
incentives 
for 
high 
levels 
of 
private 
investment 
to 
take 
place.  Factors 
contributing 
to 
limited 
competition 
and 
poor 
private 
sector 
investment 
include: 
Lack 
of 
separation 
between 
policy 
and operational 
roles 
of 
government. 
BTTB 
is 
MOPT’s 
primary 
advisor 
on 
technical 
elements 
of 
policy 
issues 
and 
MOPT 
is 
responsible 
to 
government 
for 
BTTB’s 
revenue. 
This 
has 
not 
necessarily 
ensured transparent 
and accountable development 
of 
policies 
in 
the 
sector. 
It 
has 
instead 
created 
policy 
distortions 
in 
BTTB’s 
favor 
and 
an 
uneven 
playing 
field 
for 
private 
investors 
in 
a 
sector 
where 
the government 
is 
responsible 
for 
both 
policy 
formulation 
and 
service 
provision. 
Further, 
MOPT’s 
capacity 
to 
formulate 
sector 
policies 
remains 
weak. 
Limited 
competition. 
Important 
market 
segments 
such 
as 
international 
long 
distance 
remain 
closed 
to 
competition. 
While 
the 
National 
telecommunications 
Policy 
of 
1998 
clearly 
indicates 
that the basic 
services 
and 
national 
long 
distance 
segments 
will 
be 
opened 
to 
private 
participation, 
no 
new 
operators 
have 
as 
yet 
been 
licensed.  Further, 
despite 
the 
liberalization 
of 
very 
small 
aperture 
terminals 
(VSAT) 
service, 
private 
VSAT 
operators 
are 
not 
permitted to 
resell 
excess 
capacity 
on 
their 
networks. 
Provision 
of 
mobile 
services 
by 
the 
public 
sector. 
Progress 
is 
being 
made 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
mobile 
services 
by 
the 
public 
sector. 
Public 
sector 
provision 
of 
mobile 
services 
will 
have 
to 
take 
place 
in 
a 
pro-competitive 
manner. 
That 
is, 
BTTB 
has 
to 
ensure 
fair 
transfer 
pricing, provide 
the 
new public 
operator 
and 
other 
private 
operators 
the 
same 
conditions 
for 
interconnection 
and 
sharing 
of 
facilities, and 
the 
government 
has 
to 
provide 
adequate safeguards 
that 
level 
the 
playing 
field. 
The 
public mobile 
operator 
should 
operate 
in 
a 
pro-competitive 
basis, 
without public 
subsidies 
or 
government 
guarantees. 
Limited 
capacity 
of 
BTRC. 
BTRC 
is 
a 
young 
organization and 
faces 
the 
challenge 
of 
institution 
building 
while 
establishing 
the 
regulatory 
regime. 
BTRC 
has 
the 
authority to 
establish 
the 
-6- 
Page  11
regulatory 
regime 
relative to 
issues 
such 
as 
interconnection,  licensing, 
tariffs, 
spectrum 
allocation, and 
other 
issues 
that 
will 
affect 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
sector. 
Using 
these 
tools 
to 
create 
the 
initial 
regime 
and communicate 
them 
to 
sector 
players 
will 
be 
key 
to 
creating 
and 
maintaining 
a 
level 
playing 
field 
that 
provides certainty 
and 
adequate 
incentives 
for 
private 
investment 
in 
the 
sector. 
It 
is 
critical 
to 
build 
capacity 
in 
BTRC 
so 
that 
it 
can establish and 
maintain 
regulatory 
credibility, 
which 
will 
partly 
be 
measured 
by 
its 
ability 
to 
render 
impartial, 
transparent and enforceable decisions and 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
transparent 
regulatory 
processes 
and 
procedures. 
While 
the 
Act 
generally 
provides 
for 
a 
significant 
degree 
of 
independence 
for 
BTRC, 
it 
includes certain provisions 
which may 
compromise 
this 
independence, 
including: 
(a) 
BTRC 
Commissioners 
are 
appointed 
by 
government; 
(b) 
BTRC 
reports 
on 
its 
activities through 
the 
MOPT, 
not 
directly to 
parliament; 
(c) 
MOPT 
has 
the 
right 
to 
promulgate 
rules 
pertaining to 
the 
Act 
and 
to 
direct 
the 
BTRC 
to 
modify 
regulations; and 
(d) 
BTRC 
is 
subject 
to 
civil 
service 
rules 
and 
salaries.

Inadequate interconnection 
arrangements. 
One 
of 
the 
greatest 
bottlenecks 
to 
enhanced 
competition 
and 
private 
investment 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
interconnection 
capacity. 
Interconnection 
with 
BTTB 
is 
consistently 
named 
as 
one 
of 
the 
top 
issues 
to 
be 
resolved 
in 
the 
sector 
by 
private 
operators. 
The 
current interconnect 
environment 
is 
based 
on 
“revenue 
sharing 
agreements” 
between 
BTTB 
and 
the 
mobile 
operators. 
These 
agreements 
are 
based 
on 
retail 
prices 
and 
asymmetric 
payments 
(Le., 
BTTB 
does 
not 
compensate 
mobile 
operators 
for 
call 
termination, 
but 
mobile 
operators 
pay 
BTTB 
for 
termination). 
An 
additional 
feature 
of 
the 
interconnect 
environment 
is 
inadequate 
supply 
and 
difficulty 
concluding 
negotiations. 
An 
interconnection 
regime, 
conducive 
to 
fair 
competition 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
established and 
has 
thwarted 
growth 
of 
existing cellular 
service providers. 
BTRC 
is 
mandated 
to 
issue 
interconnection 
guidelines 
and 
resolve interconnection 
disputes 
among 
operators. 
In 
this 
regard, 
BTRC 
has 
received 
a 
limited 
technical 
assistance 
grant 
from 
the 
Public 
Private Infrastructure 
Advisory Facility 
(PPIAF) 
to 
establish a 
fair, pro-competitive, interconnection 
regime. 
BTTB 
and 
the 
private cellular 
operators 
recently 
signed 
a’memorandum 
of 
understanding whereby the 
private 
operators 
will 
invest 
approximately 
US$1.7 
million 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
BTTB’s 
network 
capacity 
to 
provide 
increased 
interconnection 
for 
cellular 
subscribers. 
This 
is 
a 
positive 
development. 
0 
Distorted 
tarvs. 
Bangladesh‘s 
current 
tariff 
regime 
cross-subsidizes 
local 
calls 
by 
revenues 
earned 
from 
the 
national 
long 
distance 
and 
international 
calls. 
Further 
the 
price 
structure 
does 
not 
reflect 
costs. 
This 
has 
led 
to 
an 
inefficient 
allocation 
of 
resources 
and 
has 
inhibited 
fair 
competition 
and 
private 
investment 
in 
basic 
and 
cellular 
services.

Ineffective 
spectrum 
management. 
A 
rational 
and 
effective 
spectrum 
management 
system 
that 
optimizes 
the 
use 
of 
a 
valuable 
national 
resource 
is 
essential 
for 
an 
orderly 
and competitive 
telecommunications market. 
The 
BTRC 
has 
not 
yet 
been able 
to 
effectively 
manage 
the 
radio 
spectrum 
or 
reap 
fiscal 
benefits 
from 
the 
optimal 
use 
of 
this 
national 
resource. 
Ineffective radio 
spectrum 
management has 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
significant 
problem 
by 
private 
sector 
investors. 
Problems 
encountered 
include slow 
processing 
of 
spectrum 
licenses, excessive 
spectrum 
fees, 
inadequate and 
inefficient 
allocation 
of 
bandwidth, 
and 
interference 
caused 
by 
unauthorized 
use 
of 
spectrum. 
This 
has 
created 
bottlenecks 
for 
sector 
development and 
served 
as 
a 
deterrent 
for 
new 
investments 
in 
services 
using 
wireless 
technologies. 
Government 
strategy. 
The 
Government 
has 
undertaken 
several 
initiatives 
over 
the 
past 
four 
years 
to 
reform 
the telecommunications 
sector, 
including 
introducing competition 
and 
sector 
regulation. 
Some 
of 
the 
key 
policy 
initiatives 
and 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Government 
are 
discussed 
below.

Page  12
The GOB'S prevailing 
National 
Telecommunications 
Policy 
of 
1998 recognizes 
competition 
and 
private participation 
as 
a 
means 
of 
promoting improved 
sector 
performance. 
Private 
investments 
and operations 
are 
expected 
to 
play 
an increasingly 
important 
role 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
telecommunications 
services. 
The 
MOPT 
has 
an 
informal 
goal 
for 
the 
sector 
of 
a teledensity 
of 
3.3 
by 
2005. 
Achievement 
of 
this 
goal 
will 
require 
a capacity 
increase 
of 
3.5 
million 
lines. 
MOPT 
also 
has 
an 
informal 
goal 
for 
telereach 
of 
having 
service 
available 
in 
every 
village 
in 
Bangladesh. 
With 
assistance 
from 
the 
Infrastructure 
Investment 
Facilitation 
Center (IIFC), 
the 
Government 
has 
had public 
stakeholder 
consultations and 
reviewed 
the 
1998 
policy, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
revise 
the 
policy. 
The 
Government 
announced 
its National Information 
and 
Communications Technology 
Policy 
in 
September 
2002, 
as 
it 
aspires 
to 
use 
ICTs 
as 
a 
key 
engine 
of 
economic 
growth. 
This 
policy 
envisions 
building 
a knowledge-based society 
by 
the 
year 2006, 
where 
access 
to 
information 
allows 
for 
citizen 
empowerment, 
enhanced democracy, 
and 
sustainable 
economic development. 
It 
states 
that 
ICT 
infrastructure 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
use 
in 
human 
resource development, 
governance, E-commerce, 
banking, 
public 
services 
and 
other 
ICT 
enabled 
services. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
the 
need 
for 
reliable 
and 
competitively 
priced 
telecommunications 
infrastructure 
as 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
meaningful 
implementation 
of 
its 
ICT 
policy. 
The 
policy 
calls 
for 
accelerated 
deregulation 
of 
and 
private participation 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
The 
prime 
minister 
heads 
a 
high 
level 
national 
ICT 
task 
force 
which 
is 
spearheading 
the 
ICT 
development 
agenda. 
Recognizing 
that 
BTTB's 
poor 
performance 
is 
a 
key 
hurdle 
in 
implementing 
its 
ICT 
policy, 
the 
GOB 
has 
taken the 
decision 
to 
restructure 
BTTB 
in 
order 
to 
dramatically 
improve 
sector 
performance 
and meet 
its 
ICT 
policy 
objectives. 
It 
has 
established a 
high 
level 
task 
force, 
led 
by 
the 
MOPT, 
to 
examine 
the 
various options 
available 
for 
restructuring 
BTTB. 
The 
committee 
will 
provide 
its 
recommendation 
on 
BTTB 
restructuring 
to 
the 
Government 
by 
the 
end 
of 
June 
2003. 
Key 
elements 
of 
justification 
of 
such 
a 
restructuring 
are 
to: 
(a) 
create 
a 
level playing 
field 
within 
the 
sector 
by 
separating 
the Government's 
policy 
function 
from 
operations; 
(b) 
to 
empower 
BTTB 
to 
operate 
as 
a 
commercial 
enterprise 
with 
the 
necessary 
financial 
and administrative 
autonomy 
to 
compete 
with 
private 
operators 
in 
a 
dynamic 
multioperator 
environment; 
(c) 
remove 
preferential 
treatment 
given 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
BTTB; 
(d) 
allow 
for 
the 
pro-competitive 
entry 
of 
BTTB 
into 
the 
mobile 
market 
on 
a 
level 
playing 
field; 
and 
(e) 
to 
increase 
overall 
employment 
and government revenue 
in 
the 
sector 
by 
allowing 
for 
a 
more 
robust competitive 
environment. 
The 
establishment 
of 
BTRC 
in 
January 
2002, 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Telecommunications 
Act 
of 
2001, 
and 
appointment 
of 
its 
chairman 
and 
commissioners, 
are 
steps 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
towards 
implementing 
telecommunications 
sector 
reforms.  The Government 
has 
recognized 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
BTRC's 
regulatory capacity 
to 
ensure 
a 
level playing 
field 
in 
a 
multioperator 
environment 
and 
is 
seeking 
multilateral 
and 
bilateral 
assistance 
for 
BTRC 
capacity 
building. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
introduce 
competition 
in 
local 
and 
long 
distance 
services 
by 
licensing private 
operators. 
The 
BTRC, 
assisted 
by 
the 
IIFC 
is 
currently 
preparing 
the 
necessary 
documentation 
to 
license 
new 
operators. 
The 
above 
initiatives and 
actions 
are 
a clear 
indication 
of 
the 
Government's 
commitment 
to 
reforming 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
Moreover, 
the 
National 
ICT 
Task Force 
of 
the 
GOB, 
headed 
by 
the 
prime 
minister, 
is 
leading 
the 
reform 
process 
with 
the 
Principal 
Secretary 
to 
the 
Government 
as 
the 
reform 
champion.

The 
Bank 
has 
pursued 
policy 
dialogue 
with 
the 
Government and 
in 
its 
assessment 
of 
the 
telecommunications 
sector, 
has 
discussed 
that a 
priority 
issue 
for 
improving 
performance 
of 
the sector 
is 
to 
implement 
its 
1998 
policy, 
including 
BTTB's 
restructuring. 
Recognizing 
that 
policy 
implementation 
requires 
a 
long-term 
view 
and 
short-term 
actions, 
the 
GOB 
and 
Bank 
have 
agreed 
that 
the 
overall 
long-term 
sector 
vision 
and 
plan 
will 
necessarily 
include 
actions 
on 
the 
priority 
issues

Sector 
issues to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
it 
is 
to 
improve overall 
sector 
performance and 
reach 
the 
level 
of 
growth 
that 
is 
required to improve 
access 
and thereby socioeconomic development 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
Government 
has 
realized 
this 
and 
has 
begun 
implementing reforms 
to 
improve 
performance 
of 
the sector. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
requested 
a 
number 
of 
donors, 
including 
the 
World 
Bank, Canadian 
International 
Development Agency 
(CIDA), 
United 
Nations 
Development 
Program 
(UNDP), 
the 
Government 
of 
Japan 
and 
the 
Department 
for 
International Development 
(DFID) 
for 
assistance 
to 
implement 
reforms. 
As 
there 
is 
strong 
government 
commitment and 
willingness to 
undertake reforms, 
it 
is 
very 
important 
that support 
be 
provided 
in 
a 
timely 
manner, 
especially 
as 
the 
Government 
has 
already 
made 
substantial 
progress 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
restructuring 
BTTB. 
As 
the 
table 
above demonstrates, 
Bangladesh 
needs 
to 
undertake comprehensive 
sector 
reforms

Issues to 
be 
Addressed by the 
Project 
Within 
the 
issues 
summarized 
above 
and 
keeping 
in 
mind 
the 
political 
realities 
in 
Bangladesh, 
including 
possible 
BTTB 
labor 
union 
resistance, 
the proposed 
project 
will 
support 
selected 
interventions 
that 
have 
the 
highest 
possibility 
of 
improving performance 
of 
the 
telecommunications 
sector, 
through 
increased 
competition 
and 
improved 
environment for 
private 
sector 
participation. 
The interventions 
are 
intentionally 
limited 
to focus 
IDA 
resources 
on 
addressing 
key 
bottlenecks 
that 
have 
affected 
sector 
performance. 
Bank 
support 
complements 
assistance 
being 
provided 
by 
other 
agencies such 
as 
CIDA, 
DFID, 
and 
PPIAF. 
IDA 
resources 
will 
be 
used 
to 
address 
the 
short-term 
policy 
objectives 
as 
stated 
in 
Table 
3. 
The 
project 
will 
address 
(i) 
separation 
of 
the 
government's 
operational and 
policy 
roles; 
and 
(ii) 
developing regulatory 
capacity 
in 
the 
BTRC 
to 
effectively 
regulate a 
competitive 
telecommunications 
sector. 
In 
particular, 
the 
following 
will 
be 
addressed: 
BTTB 
restructuring. 
This 
will 
address 
issues 
related 
to 
both 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
sector 
and 
in 
improving 
the 
environment 
for 
private 
investments 
and competition.  Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
MOPT 
to 
implement 
the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
from 
a Government 
department. 
Restructuring 
will 
allow 
for: 
(a) 
a clear separation 
of 
government's 
role 
as 
a 
policy 
maker and 
operator; 
(b) 
identification 
and 
removal 
of 
all 
preferential 
treatment, 
including 
tax and 
procurement, 
that 
BTTB 
as 
a government 
board 
receives and 
is 
a 
barrier 
to 
leveling 
the 
playing 
field; 
(c) 
BTTB 
to 
be 
subjected 
to regulation 
by 
BTRC 
on 
the 
same 
lines 
as 
other 
private 
sector 
operators, 
thereby 
allowing 
for 
all 
operators 
to 
operate 
in 
a 
level playing 
field; 
and 
(d) 
the 
government 
to 
better 
manage 
public 
expenditure 
accountability 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
Restructuring 
will 
prepare 
BTTB 
for 
competition 
through 
(i) 
productivity 
and 
profitability 
improvements; 
(ii) 
change 
in 
orientation 
towards 
becoming 
market and 
commercially 
focused; 
(iii) 
internal culture 
change; 
and 
(iv) 
decision-making 
autonomy and 
flexibility. 
This 
will 
facilitate 
funding 
of 
development 
projects and 
also 
provide 
BTTB 
with 
access 
to private 
capital, 
and 
strategic 
and commercial 
alliances. 
Overall, 
a 
restructured 
BTTB 
will 
create 
long 
term 
shareholder 
value 
and generally 
improve 
sector 
performance. 
Strengthening 
thepolicy 
function 
of 
MOPT. 
A 
restructured 
BTTB 
should 
not 
be 
able 
to 
influence 
MOPT's 
policy 
function. 
In 
addition, 
MOPT 
will 
no 
longer 
have a 
direct 
oversight 
function 
over 
BTTB. 
This 
separation 
of 
policy 
and operational roles 
in 
the 
government, 
necessitates 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
function 
within 
MOPT, 
so 
that 
it 
can establish a 
policy 
and 
institutional framework 
that 
encourages 
improved 
sector 
performance 
and 
growth, 
with 
increased 
private participation 
and 
investments. 
MOPT 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
Bank 
support 
through 
technical 
assistance 
to 
build 
and 
develop 
capacity 
to 
formulate and 
oversee 
sound 
policy, 
including 
the 
design 
of 
a 
universal 
access 
strategy 
in 
Bangladesh. 
Bangladesh 
has 
prepared a 
schedule 
of 
specific 
World 
Trade 
Organization 
(WTO) 
commitments 
under 
the 
telecommunications 
service section 
of 
the 
General 
Agreement 
on 
Trade 
in 
Services. 
This 
is 
currently 
being 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Commerce.  Support 
will 
be 
provided to 
review 
and 
revise 
this 
schedule 
of 
commitments 
so 
that Bangladesh can consider 
additional commitments 
on 
regulatory disciplines, 
such 
as 
compliance 
with 
the 
WTO 
Regulatory 
Reference Paper. 
Strengthening 
BTRC's 
capacity 
to 
regulate 
a 
multioperator environment and ensure 
a 
level 
playing 
for 
all 
operators. 
Recognizing 
that the establishment 
of 
a 
credible regulatory 
regime 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
key 
to 
increasing 
competition 
and 
private 
investment 
in 
the 
telecom 
sector, 
Bank 
support 
will 
be 
utilized 
to 
strengthen 
BTRC 
and 
assist 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a 
regulatory 
- 
10- 
Page  15
framework 
that 
is 
WTO 
compliant.  Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to: 
(a) 
establish 
credible 
regulations 
(e.g., 
interconnection, 
licensing 
and 
tariff 
regime) 
that 
lay 
the 
foundation 
for 
a 
competitive 
telecommunications 
sector; 
(b) 
implement 
further 
sector 
liberalization 
through the 
award 
of 
new 
licenses 
to private 
investors and 
removal 
of 
barriers 
to 
competitive 
provision 
of 
services; (c) 
address 
a 
regulatory 
strategy 
to improve 
rural 
access; 
and 
(d) 
build 
capacity 
within 
BTRC 
to 
address 
regulatory 
issues 
and 
manage 
scarce 
resources 
like 
the 
radio 
spectrum. 
BTRC 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
assistance 
to 
procure 
and 
implement 
a spectrum 
management 
and 
monitoring 
system. 
Strategic 
Choices 
In 
selecting 
the 
above 
areas, 
the 
project 
supports the 
government’s 
efforts to 
strengthen 
the 
environment 
to 
promote 
private 
investment 
and 
competition. 
The 
project intentionally 
does 
not 
address: 
Investments 
in 
interconnection infrastructure. 
The 
lack 
of 
adequate 
interconnection facilities 
in 
BTTB‘s 
network 
has 
always been a 
key 
factor 
thwarting 
sector 
development 
in 
Bangladesh. 
The 
GOB 
has 
asked 
for 
Bank 
assistance 
to 
provide 
funds 
to 
procure 
equipment 
to 
facilitate 
interconnection. However, 
Bank 
policy 
in 
telecommunications excludes 
direct 
financing 
of 
telecommunications 
infrastructure 
investments. 
Moreover, 
private cellular 
operators 
are 
going to 
finance 
key 
equipment 
in 
BTTB’s 
network to 
facilitate 
the 
interconnection 
of 
their 
subscribers 
to 
BTTB’s 
network. 
Instead, 
the 
Bank 
will 
focus 
on 
the establishment 
of 
an 
appropriate 
and 
credible interconnection 
regime 
that 
provides incentives 
for 
BTTB 
to 
establish 
proper 
interconnection 
arrangements. 
While 
this 
will 
help 
resolve 
some 
of 
the problems, 
much 
larger 
investments 
are 
required 
by 
BTTB 
to 
address 
this 
issue. 
The 
Japan 
Bank for 
International 
Cooperation (JBIC) 
has 
indicated 
the 
possibility 
of 
funding 
the expansion 
of 
interconnection 
capacity 
in 
BTTB’s 
network 
if 
BTTB: 
(a) 
adheres 
to 
the 
interconnection 
regime 
established 
by 
the 
BTRC; 
and 
(b) 
is 
restructured 
to 
ensure 
a 
level playing 
field 
for 
all 
operators 
especially 
since 
it 
is 
entering 
the 
mobile 
market.  Furthermore, a 
restructured 
BTTB 
will 
have 
the 
financial 
autonomy and 
incentives 
to 
reinvest 
its 
profits 
to 
develop 
interconnection infrastructure. 
Investments 
in 
a 
rural 
accessprogram: 
Given 
the 
dismal 
state 
of 
rural 
connectivity 
in 
Bangladesh, 
an output 
based 
aid 
(OBA) 
type 
program, targeted towards 
increasing 
access 
to 
telephony and 
ICTs 
was considered. 
However, 
experience demonstrates 
that such programs 
are 
more 
successful 
in 
countries where 
regulatory 
and administrative 
obstacles 
to market 
entry 
and 
competition 
are 
first 
removed. 
The 
proposed 
project 
therefore 
focuses 
on 
establishing 
a 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
to 
improve 
the 
environment 
for 
increased 
competition 
and 
private 
investment, and 
developing 
a 
rural 
access 
strategy 
for 
future 
implementation.

Component: 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
separate

roles 
of 
the 
Government. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
through 
(i) 
restructuring 
BTTB; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
function 
in 
MOPT.

Restructuring 
of 
BTTB. 
Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
implement 
BTTB 
restructuring 
and 
convert 
it 
from 
the 
present 
Government 
board 
into 
a company, 
registered 
under 
the 
Company's 
Act. 
Support 
will 
be 
provided to 
carry 
out 
a 
number 
of 
activities 
including: 
Re-examining Ordinance 
XII 
of 
1979 
(amended 
in 
1995) 
that 
established 
BTTB. 
The 
Government 
needs 
to 
approve 
the 
recommendation 
made 
by 
the 
high 
level 
committee 
on 
BTTB 
restructuring 
to 
guide 
the 
overall 
restructuring.  Ordinance 
XI1 
may 
have 
to 
be 
amended 
to 
enable 
the 
restructuring. 
The 
process 
of 
drafting, 
presenting, and amending 
the 
ordinance 
will 
be 
undertaken.  Further, other 
legal 
documents necessary 
for 
the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
will 
also 
be 
prepared. 
AssetAiability 
allocation. 
BTTB's 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
currently reflected 
as 
government 
property. 
In 
order 
for 
BTTB 
to 
operate 
on 
a 
commercial 
basis, 
it 
will 
need 
title 
to 
its 
assets 
and 
to 
develop depreciation 
and 
capital 
expenditure programs 
to 
support 
them. 
In 
addition to 
developing an 
inventory 
and 
valuation 
of 
fixed 
assets, 
this 
task 
will 
also 
include 
negotiation 
of 
land 
and 
building 
ownershiphse 
between 
BTTB 
and 
Government. 
Appropriate 
levels 
of 
debt 
to 
fund 
the 
assets 
to 
be 
transferred 
from 
Government 
to 
BTTB 
will 
also 
need 
to 
be 
determined. 
Financial 
audit and creation 
of 
openingjnancial 
statements. 
A 
financial 
audit 
will 
both 
identify 
BTTB's 
operating 
position 
and 
create 
the 
initial 
financial 
statements 
that 
the 
corporatized 
BTTB 
will 
be 
required 
to 
maintain. 
The 
financial 
audit 
will 
also 
provide 
valuable 
information 
about 
financial 
information 
systems 
to 
be 
created 
for 
BTTB. 
Cost-based 
tariffstudy. 
BTRC 
has 
a mandate 
to 
enforce 
a reasonable, cost-based 
tariff 
- 
12- 
Page  17
structure, 
which 
will 
mean rate 
rebalancing 
for 
BTTB. 
In 
parallel 
with 
BTTB 
restructuring, 
BTTB 
and 
BTRC 
will 
work 
together 
to 
establish 
cost-based rates 
and 
a 
plan 
to 
transition 
to 
those rates. 
The 
transition 
would 
require 
carrying 
out 
a 
benchmarking 
tariff 
study 
which 
will 
provide: 
(a) 
a 
tariff 
proposal 
by 
comparing 
it 
to 
other 
operators 
in 
the 
region, that 
run 
their 
business 
efficiently; 
and 
(b) 
an 
action 
plan 
with 
a 
monthly 
change 
in 
tariffs to 
rebalance 
tariffs 
in 
a couple 
of 
years. 
This 
will 
also 
provide 
BTRC 
with 
the 
required 
analysis 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
cost-based 
pricing for 
unbundled 
network 
elements. 
Examining 
options 
for 
rationalization 
of 
labor 
force. 
A 
restructured 
BTTB 
will 
likely 
need 
to 
employ 
fewer than 
its 
current 
labor force 
of 
22,000 
staff. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
restructuring 
process, an 
investigation should 
be 
made 
into 
a 
proposed 
new 
organizational 
structure and 
reduction 
plan. 
This 
reduction 
plan 
will 
need 
to 
be 
negotiated 
with 
the 
union, 
as 
well 
as 
any 
potential 
donors 
who 
might 
provide financing 
to 
implement 
it. 
Public 
relations. 
Because 
of 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
the 
stakeholder 
community, 
it 
is 
critical 
that 
MOPT 
manage 
public 
relations very closely throughout 
the 
restructuring 
planning 
period. 
BTTB 
union 
officials 
will 
be 
exposed 
to 
the 
experience 
of 
unions 
in 
telecommunications 
companies 
that were restructured 
in 
other countries. 
Development 
of 
a 
business 
plan. 
The 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
will 
require 
that 
it 
develops 
a 
corporate 
business 
plan 
to 
guide 
its 
operations 
after restructuring. 
Development 
of 
aperformance 
contract for 
BTTB. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
actually 
results 
in 
improved 
performance, support 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
develop a 
performance contract 
for BTTB. 
Project 
funds 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
carry 
out 
annual 
performance 
audits. 
Such a contract 
would 
provide 
incentives 
to 
BTTB 
to improve 
performance. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
BTTB 
does 
not 
fulfill 
its 
performance commitments, 
BTTB 
could, 
for 
example, 
lose 
its 
exclusivity 
to 
provide 
certain 
services, 
earlier than 
planned. 
Other support 
as 
may be 
needed. 
It 
is 
expected that the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
will 
(a) 
limit 
BTTB's 
function only 
to 
operations, 
thereby 
removing 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
incumbent 
distorting 
policy 
decisions 
in 
its 
favor; 
(b) 
allow 
the 
GOB, 
through 
BTTB's 
corporate 
financial 
statements, 
to 
get transparent 
information 
on 
the 
financial 
performance 
of 
BTTB 
and 
its 
contributions 
to 
the 
treasury; 
and 
(c) 
ensure 
that 
BTTB 
is 
subject 
to 
regulatory oversight 
by 
BTRC 
on 
a 
level playing 
field 
with all 
other 
operators 
in 
the 
sector. 
These 
important 
changes 
will 
positively 
impact 
sector 
performance 
and 
encourage 
greater 
competition 
and 
private 
sector 
participation. 
Strengthening 
MOPT's 
policy 
function. 
Technical 
assistance 
support 
for 
consultancy 
and 
training 
programs 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
MOPT's 
capacity 
to 
carryout 
its 
policy 
functions. 
This 
will 
include 
(i) 
policy 
review 
and 
formulation; 
establishment 
of 
processes 
and 
procedures 
for policy 
monitoring 
and evaluation;  and 
re-examination 
of 
Bangladesh's 
WTO 
commitments 
and 
preparation 
of 
a 
new 
telecommunications offer; 
(ii) 
development 
of 
a 
universal 
access 
strategy; 
(iii) 
other 
studies 
on policy 
issues 
such 
as 
convergence, 
market 
structure, 
competition; 
(iv) 
capacity 
building 
and professional 
development 
through in-country, 
on 
the 
job 
and external 
training 
programs; and 
(v) 
procurement 
of 
equipment and 
systems 
to facilitate 
information 
sharing 
and 
dissemination, 
within 
and outside 
of

Benefits 
and 
target population: 
affordability 
and 
quality 
of 
traditional 
and 
modern 
telecommunication 
services. 
Improved 
BTTB 
performance, 
the 
introduction 
of 
competition 
and 
a 
more effective regulatory 
framework 
will 
lead 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
more 
competitive 
services 
in 
terms 
of 
price, 
quality 
and variety. 
It 
will 
also reduce 
information isolation 
for 
populations 
living 
in 
rural 
areas. 
The 
improvement and 
expansion 
of 
telecommunication 
services 
will 
contribute 
to 
sustainable 
economic 
growth.  Also, 
the 
large non-resident 
Bangladeshi 
community 
will 
benefit 
from 
improved efficiency 
and 
affordability 
of 
communications 
services 
to 
Bangladesh. 
The 
project 
will 
benefit 
the 
Bangladeshi 
population 
as 
a 
whole 
by 
increasing 
the 
availability, 
The 
IT 
industry 
and 
businesses, 
which 
increasingly 
depend 
upon 
communications 
services 
to 
be 
competitive, 
will 
especially 
benefit 
from 
lower 
costs 
and 
the 
availability 
of 
a 
greater 
variety 
of 
value 
added services. 
A 
modern 
telecommunications 
regulatory 
framework, 
ensuring 
market innovations 
and 
competition, 
will 
make Bangladesh 
more 
attractive 
to foreign 
investors.

The 
two 
organizations responsible 
for 
implementing 
the 
project 
are 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC. 
Each 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
executing 
its 
respective component. 
Project 
Steering Committees 
(PSC) 
have 
been established 
at 
each 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
provide overall 
guidance 
on 
the 
management 
of 
the 
project 
components. 
The 
PSC 
in 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC, 
will 
be 
headed 
by 
the 
Secretary 
MOPT 
and 
Chairman BTRC, 
respectively. 
Project 
Management 
Teams 
(PMT) 
have 
been 
established 
at 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
to 
manage 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
the 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project. 
The 
PMTs 
are 
headed 
by 
a 
Project Director 
and 
include 
staff 
from within 
the 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
who 
are 
knowledgeable 
in 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management. 
The 
Project Directors 
for 
the 
PMTs 
are 
senior 
officials 
from 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC. 
The 
PMTs 
in 
both 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
will 
also 
be 
assisted 
by 
local

(PMC) 
and 
Project 
Implementation 
Specialist 
(PIS), 
respectively, 
funded 
under 
the 
proposed 
credit. 
Their 
principal 
task 
is

D. 
Project Rationale 
1, 
Project 
alternatives considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Rationale 
Although 
gaps 
exist 
in 
Bangladesh's 
policy 
and regulatory 
environment, there 
is 
a 
strong 
government 
willingness 
to implement 
sector 
reforms 
in 
Bangladesh, 
especially 
with 
regard 
to 
restructuring 
BTTB. 
BTTB's 
behavior 
as 
a 
Government 
enterprise 
department 
has 
been 
a 
key 
constraint 
to 
sector 
development. 
Given 
the 
Government's 
commitment 
to 
reforms, 
including 
its 
support 
for 
and 
readiness 
to 
separate 
the 
policy 
and operational roles 
of 
Government, 
the 
Bank 
can 
capture 
an 
opportunity 
to 
facilitate 
improvements 
in 
Bangladesh's 
telecommunications 
sector 
performance. 
The 
timing 
of 
this 
proposed 
operation 
is 
key 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Bank 
responds 
adequately and 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
to 
the 
GOB'S 
request. 
Further 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
project 
has 
deliberately 
been 
kept 
very 
limited 
to 
address 
the short 
term 
objectives 
of 
the 
Government's 
reform 
agenda 
and 
focus 
on 
the 
key 
constraints 
that have 
hampered 
sector 
development. 
The 
basic 
policy 
framework, although 
not 
perfect, 
is 
adequate 
to 
pursue 
this 
activity. 
Further, the establishment 
of 
the 
regulator 
BTRC, which 
is 
being 
provided 
limited 
support 
by 
both 
the 
PPIAF 
and 
CIDA, 
represents 
sufficient 
forward 
movement 
for 
IDA 
to 
support 
the 
government 
in 
implementing 
the 
remaining 
agenda 
on 
its 
sector 
reform 
program. 
The 
project 
outputs 
are 
also 
consistent 
with 
telecom 
sector targets 
specified 
in 
the 
Bangladesh 
Development 
Support 
Credit currently 
under 
preparation. 
Alternatives 
The 
following 
project 
design alternatives 
were 
considered and rejected: 
e 
Designing 
the 
project 
as 
a 
multisectoral 
(infrastructure 
including 
telecommunications) 
technical 
assistance 
facility. 
This 
approach 
was 
rejected 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
(a) 
a 
multisectoral 
approach 
would 
not 
allow for 
fast 
track 
processing 
of 
a 
project 
that 
is 
necessary 
to 
leverage 
upon 
the 
ongoing 
telecommunications 
reform 
momentum 
in 
the 
Bangladeshi 
telecommunications 
sector; 
(b) 
IDA 
is 
already 
supporting 
IIFC 
and 
the 
Infrastructure 
Development Company 
Limited 
(IDCOL), 
which 
can 
provide 
consultancy 
services 
and 
financing 
for 
infrastructure 
projects; and 
(c) 
the 
experiences 
from 
other 
umbrella 
technical 
assistance 
projects 
in 
Bangladesh, 
to 
support focused 
technical 
assistance 
projects 
with 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
pre-identified 
components 
in 
the 
future.

e 
Pursuing 
a broader 
Comprehensive 
reform 
project, 
rather 
than a 
focused, 
limited 
project. 
The 
telecommunications 
sector 
reform 
process 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
slow 
but 
ongoing. 
The 
Bank 
could 
pursue 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
reform 
program 
that 
would 
involve 
overhauling 
the 
existing 
legislative 
framework 
among 
others. 
However, 
given 
that 
important, 
necessary 
steps 
to 
accelerate 
the 
reform 
process have 
been 
taken 
(passage 
of 
Telecommunications 
Act 
of 
2001 
and 
establishment 
of 
BTRC), 
and that 
there 
is 
high-level 
government 
commitment 
to 
address 
the 
most 
critical 
impediments 
to 
sector 
development 
(BTTB 
restructuring),  a focused 
project, 
limited 
in 
scope 
would 
address 
key 
issues 
that have 
the 
potential 
to 
make a 
positive 
impact 
on 
sector 
performance. 
The 
implementation 
of 
these 
key 
reform 
initiatives 
would 
also demonstrate 
GOB'S 
seriousness 
to 
undertake 
more 
comprehensive 
reforms 
which 
could 
be 
addressed 
in 
a 
possible 
future 
IDA 
operation.

are

The

lessons 
were learned 
from 
other

reform 
and restructuring projects and 
from 
e 
Newly 
established 
regulatory 
agencies

overwhelmed,

resources 
to 
draw 
upon. 
Support 
from 
resident 
advisors, 
operational advice and 
hand 
holding 
during 
the 
initial 
years 
of 
operation 
are 
invaluable. 
Telecommunications 
sector 
policies 
should 
include 
a 
set 
of 
incentives 
to 
promote 
access 
to 
services 
for 
remote 
rural 
communities 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
affordability 
and 
availability 
of 
services 
to 
the 
poor 
in 
both rural 
and 
urban 
areas. 
Competition 
is 
key 
to 
increasing 
growth 
in 
the 
sector. 
A 
clear, 
predictable regulatory framework 
is 
a 
prerequisite 
to 
attracting 
investment 
in 
the 
sector. 
Furthermore, 
the 
momentum 
created 
by 
policy reform 
initiatives 
can 
lead 
to 
sustained sector 
growth, 
provided 
prompt 
implementation 
is 
undertaken. 
Government should 
not 
participate 
as 
a 
provider 
of 
telecommunications 
services, 
which 
are 
more 
efficiently 
run 
as 
commercial 
entities. 
Speed 
is 
key to 
telecommunications 
reform.  The 
design 
of 
this 
operation 
is 
intended 
to 
achieve 
a 
quick 
win 
in 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
policy 
and operational roles 
of 
government 
which 
is 
a 
cornerstone 
of 
sector 
reform. 
A 
project 
that 
is 
focused and 
simple 
to 
administer 
(e.g., 
focusing 
just 
on 
telecommunications 
rather 
than 
including 
other 
sectors) 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
get 
bogged 
down 
by 
administrative 
or 
other 
procedural 
delays. 
Strong 
government 
commitment 
is 
necessary 
for 
successful 
implementation 
of 
a 
technical 
assistance 
project.

Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
establishing 
an 
effective 
regulatory framework and 
its 
ownership 
for 
this

is 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
following 
actions 
and initiatives.

which 
places 
significant importance 
on 
the 
establishment 
of

Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
including 
India, 
Afghanistan, 
Nepal, 
Pakistan, 
and 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
the 
value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
extensive 
international 
experience 
in 
addressing 
telecommunications 
sector 
reform, 
designing 
effective policies 
and establishing 
regulatory 
frameworks. 
This 
experience 
coupled 
with 
the Bank's 
neutrality 
is 
attractive 
for 
the 
Government. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Bank 
has 
developed 
significant 
experience 
in 
supporting 
the 
international 
best 
practice 
approach 
to 
spectrum 
management 
and 
monitoring. 
The 
Bank 
is 
involved 
in 
supporting

management 
and 
monitoring 
in 
several 
countries, such 
as 
India, Nigeria, 
Pakistan,

The

regulatory reforms which, 
if 
successfully 
implemented, 
will 
enable 
supply 
and 
demand 
of 
telecommunications 
to 
evolve 
favorably 
for 
consumers. 
The 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
project, 
resulting 
from 
improved 
sector 
performance 
and therefore 
increased 
penetration 
and 
access, 
are 
likely

(see

- 
Given 
the 
small 
size 
and technical 
assistance 
nature 
of 
the 
project, an 
economic 
analysis 
is 
not 
improved 
range 
and 
quality 
of 
service 
provision; 
reduced 
prices 
for 
advanced services 
that 
will 
allow 
businesses 
and the 
Government 
to 
reduce 
business 
costs 
and expand 
their 
use 
of 
information 
technology; 
advanced 
information 
services also have 
wide-ranging applications 
in 
health 
care 
and 
education, 
and 
these 
will 
become 
more 
affordable 
as 
prices 
fall; 
improved 
investment 
climate; 
significant 
increases 
in 
off-farm 
employment 
and 
income 
generation 
across 
a 
number 
of 
countries, 
including 
Bangladesh; 
improvements 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery 
by 
the 
government; 
faster response 
to 
emergencies, 
as 
proximity 
to 
a 
telephone 
allow 
customers 
to 
easily 
receive 
unsolicited 
information not 
requested 
due 
to 
information 
asymmetries 
(for 
example, customers 
can 
receive 
information 
about 
imminent major 
hurricanes that 
they 
would 
not 
know 
in 
advance 
to 
request); 
and 
equalizing 
access 
to 
information 
infrastructure 
has 
a 
significant impact 
on 
reducing inequality 
within 
countries. 
While, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
provide 
a 
quantitative 
estimate 
of 
the 
response 
of 
private 
investors 
to 
the 
regulatory 
and 
policy 
environment, 
greater 
competition 
in 
the 
sector 
will 
lead to 
improved 
services, 
thereby 
stimulating 
economic growth, 
resulting 
in 
a broader 
source 
of 
revenues 
to 
GOB from 
tax 
receipts. 
Such 
indirect 
benefits, 
although 
difficult 
to 
quantify, 
are 
certain.

Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
fiscal 
impact 
analysis 
to 
estimate 
BTTB’s 
annual 
contribution 
to 
the 
national 
treasury 
before 
and 
after 
the 
restructuring 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
4. 
Historically, 
BTTB 
has 
produced 
a 
significant 
revenue 
surplus 
(cash revenues 
less 
cash expenditures) 
that 
is 
transferred 
to 
the 
treasury, 
which 
in 
tum 
funds 
BTTB’s 
annual 
investment 
requirements. 
The 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
and 
the 
on-going 
sector 
reforms 
(regulation, 
tariffs, 
interconnection, 
competition, 
licensing, 
etc.) 
will 
greatly 
influence 
the 
size, 
shape 
and 
direction 
of 
the 
sector 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years.  Because 
of 
all 
the 
changes 
that 
are 
taking 
place 
simultaneously 
in 
the 
sector, an estimate 
of 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
BTTB’s 
restructuring 
factors 
in 
all 
of 
these 
other 
elements. 
The 
government 
will 
experience an 
immediate 
cash 
flow 
impact 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
restructure 
process, 
but 
the 
overall 
magnitude 
of 
the 
contribution 
may not 
be 
as 
severely impacted. 
The 
treasury can 
potentially gain more 
(net 
cash), 
year-over-year 
from 
BTTB 
as 
a 
limited 
company. 
The 
net 
amount that 
is 
actually 
transferred 
to 
the 
treasury 
depends 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
on 
the 
level 
of 
investment 
made 
by 
BTTB. 
It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
note 
that 
beginning 
in 
2003 the 
mobile 
operators 
begin 
to provide 
more to 
the 
national 
treasury 
than 
BTTB, 
even 
though 
it 
is 
assumed 
the 
mobile 
operators have 
been 
granted 
a 
tax 
holiday 
through 
2006. 
In 
a 
high 
growth 
scenario, 
BTTB 
catches 
up 
to 
the 
mobile 
operators, 
in 
terms 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
treasury, 
in 
the 
year 
2010.

the

Under 
this 
framework, 
technology 
choices 
in 
the 
sector 
will 
be 
market-driven.  Private

will 
lead to 
the 
import 
of 
new 
technology 
and

know-how.

Procurement 
issues: 
During 
pre-appraisal, 
the 
procurement capacity 
of 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
was 
assessed 
as 
high risk 
and an action 
plan 
was agreed 
upon 
with 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
to mitigate 
this 
risk. 
See 
Annex

completed 
and actions 
to 
meet 
the

fiduciary 
requirements were 
agreed. 
The 
detailed findings 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
review 
and 
the 
action 
plan 
to mitigate 
these 
weaknesses are 
provided 
in 
Annex 
6 
(b). 
The implementation 
of 
the 
action 
plan 
during 
the 
project 
period 
will 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
financial 
management. 
Given 
the 
weak 
financial 
management 
capacity, 
MOPT 
will 
appoint before

a 
Project 
Management Consultant 
(PMC) 
with 
a 
financial 
management 
expert 
in 
its 
team 
to 
look 
after 
the 
project 
accounting 
needs 
of 
both 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
of 
BTRC. 
The 
PMC will 
define 
the 
financial 
management needs 
of 
BTRC 
and 
assist 
in 
the 
design and 
implementation 
of 
a 
computerized accounting 
system. 
The 
PMC 
will 
also 
provide 
adequate 
training to 
all 
financial 
management 
staff 
to transfer 
skills 
and knowledge 
to 
sustain an adequate 
system 
in 
BTRC 
beyond 
the 
project 
period. 
In 
addition, 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
will 
hire 
a 
project 
accountant and an assistant 
Director 
(Finance and 
Revenue), 
respectively,

Sustainability

Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
By 
developing an 
adequate 
institutional 
and 
regulatory framework 
for 
market-based 
telecommunications 
service 
provision, 
the 
project 
will 
help 
accelerate 
investment 
and 
improve 
sector 
performance. 
Incentives 
to 
sustain 
project 
objectives 
include 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
so 
that 
the 
rights 
and obligations 
of 
the 
incumbent and 
private 
operators 
are 
codified 
both 
in 
the 
legislation 
and 
licenses. 
Improved 
service coverage 
and 
quality 
at 
more 
competitive prices 
will 
be 
sustained 
as 
private 
investment 
grows 
in 
telecommunications infrastructure and 
services.

Detailed Project Description 
BANGLADESH: Telecommunications Technical Assistance Project 
The 
project 
objective 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
Bangladesh's 
telecommunications 
sector 
through 
strengthening 
elements 
of 
the 
policy, 
institutional, 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
the 
competitive 
provision 
of 
telecommunications 
infrastructure and 
services. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
by: 
(a) 
restructuring 
the 
Bangladesh Telegraph 
and 
Telephone 
Board 
(BTTB); 
(b) 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
function 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Post 
and Telecommunications 
(MOPT);  and 
(c) 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
capacity 
of 
the 
Bangladesh 
Telecommunication Regulatory 
Commission 
(BTRC).

Project Component

A. 
MOPT 
COMPONENT 
: 
Separation 
of 
the 
Policy 
and 
Operational 
Roles 
of 
the 
Government 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
first 
component 
is 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
separation 
in 
the 
policy 
and 
operational 
role 
of 
the 
government 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
This 
effort 
to 
prevent 
telecommunications 
policy 
capture 
by 
a government 
owned 
department 
will 
be 
achieved 
through: 
(i) 
restructuring 
BTTB 
into 
a 
company; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
function 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communications. 
BTTB 
restructuring 
is 
an 
opportunity to 
level 
the 
playing 
field 
for 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
sector, 
as 
it 
will 
allow 
for: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
a clear separation 
of 
government's 
role 
as 
a 
policy 
maker and 
operator; 
identification 
and 
removal 
of 
all 
preferential 
treatment, 
including 
tax, 
procurement, that 
BTTB 
as 
a government 
board 
receives and 
is 
a 
barrier 
to 
leveling 
the 
playing 
field; 
BTTB 
to 
improve 
investment, 
efficiency 
and customer orientation, 
thereby 
improving 
sector 
performance; 
BTTB 
to 
become subject 
to regulation 
by 
BTRC 
on 
the 
same 
lines 
as 
other 
private 
sector 
operators, 
thereby 
allowing for 
all 
operators 
to 
operate 
in 
a 
level 
playing 
field; 
the government 
to 
better 
manage 
public 
expenditure 
accountability 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
The 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
necessitates 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
function 
within 
MOPT, 
so 
that 
it 
can 
establish a 
policy 
and 
institutional 
framework 
that 
encourages 
improved 
sector 
performance 
and 
growth, 
with 
increased 
private participation 
and 
investments. 
This 
component includes, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
following: 
(i) 
BTTB 
Restructuring 
- 
Consultant 
support 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
number 
of 
activities 
to 
include: 
Re-examining 
Ordinance 
XI1 
of 
1979 
(amended 
in 
1995) 
that 
established 
BTTB. 
Government 
needs 
to 
select 
a 
model 
to 
guide 
the 
overall 
restructuring and 
then 
amend Ordinance 
XI1 
to 
enable 
the 
selected 
model. 
The 
process 
of 
drafting, 
presenting, 
and amending 
the ordinance 
will 
be 
undertaken. 
Other 
legal 
documents necessary 
for 
the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
will 
also 
be 
prepared. 
Asset/liability 
allocation. 
BTTB's 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
currently reflected 
as 
government 
property. 
In 
order 
for 
BTTB 
to 
operate ona 
commercial 
basis, 
it 
will 
need 
title 
to 
its 
assets 
and 
to 
develop depreciation 
and 
capital 
expenditure programs 
to 
support 
them. 
In 
addition to 
developing an 
inventory 
and 
valuation 
of 
fixed 
assets, 
this 
task 
will 
also 
include 
negotiation 
of 
- 
31 
- 
Page  36
land 
and 
building 
ownershipluse 
between 
BTTB 
and 
Government. 
Appropriate 
levels 
of 
debt 
to 
fund 
the 
assets 
to 
be 
transferred 
from 
government 
to 
BTTB 
will 
also 
need 
to 
be 
determined. 
Financial 
audit 
and 
creation 
of 
opening 
financial 
statements. 
A 
financial 
audit 
will 
both 
identify 
BTTB's 
operating 
position 
and 
create 
the 
initial 
financial 
statements 
that 
the 
restructured 
BTTB 
will 
be 
required 
to 
maintain. 
The 
financial 
audit 
will 
also 
provide 
valuable 
information 
about 
financial 
information 
systems 
to 
be 
created 
for 
BTTB. 
Cost-based 
tariffstudy. 
BTRC 
has 
a 
mandate 
to 
enforce a 
reasonable, cost-based 
tariff 
structure, 
which 
will 
mean rate 
rebalancing 
for 
BTTB. 
In 
parallel 
with 
BTTB 
restructuring, 
BTTB 
and 
BTRC 
will 
work 
together 
to 
establish 
cost-based rates 
and a 
plan 
to 
transition 
to 
those rates. 
The 
transition 
would 
require 
carrying 
out 
a 
benchmarking 
tariff 
study 
which 
will 
provide: 
(a) 
a 
tariff 
proposal 
by 
comparing 
it 
to 
other 
operators 
in 
the 
region, that 
run 
their 
business 
efficiently; 
and 
(b) 
an action 
plan 
with 
a 
monthly 
change 
in 
tariffs to 
rebalance 
tariffs 
in 
a 
couple 
of 
years. 
This 
will 
also 
provide 
BTRC 
with 
the 
required 
analysis 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
cost-based 
pricing 
for 
unbundled 
network 
elements. 
Examining 
options 
for  rationalization 
of 
labor force. 
A 
restructured 
BTTB will 
likely 
need 
to 
employ 
fewer than 
its 
current 
labor 
force 
of 
22,000 
staff. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
restructuring 
process, 
an 
investigation 
should 
be 
made 
into 
a 
proposed 
new 
organizational 
structure 
and 
reduction 
plan. 
This 
reduction 
plan 
will 
need 
to 
be 
negotiated 
with 
the 
union, 
as 
well 
as 
any 
potential 
donors 
who 
might 
provide financing to 
implement 
it. 
Public 
relations. 
Because 
of 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
the 
stakeholder 
community, 
it 
is 
critical 
that 
MOPT 
manage 
public 
relations 
very 
closely throughout 
the 
restructuring 
planning 
period. 
MOPT, 
BTTB 
and 
union officials 
will 
be 
exposed 
to 
the experience 
of 
telecommunications 
companies that were restructured 
in 
other countries. 
Development 
of 
a 
business 
plan. 
The 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
will 
require 
that 
it 
develops 
a 
corporate 
business 
plan 
to 
guide 
its 
operations after 
restructuring. 
Development 
of 
aperformance 
contract 
for 
BTTB. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
actually 
results 
in 
improved 
performance, support 
will 
be 
provided to 
develop 
a 
performance contract 
for 
BTTB. 
Project 
funds 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
carry out 
annual 
performance 
audits. 
Such 
a 
contract 
would 
provide 
incentives 
to 
BTTB 
to 
improve 
performance. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
BTTB 
does 
not 
fulfill 
its 
performance 
commitments, 
BTTB 
could, 
for 
example, 
lose 
its 
exclusivity to provide 
certain 
services, 
earlier 
than planned. 
Other 
support 
as 
may 
be 
needed. 
(ii) 
Strengthening 
MOPT's 
Policy 
Function: 
Technical 
assistance 
support 
for 
consultancy and 
training 
programs 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
MOPT's 
capacity 
to 
carryout 
its 
policy 
functions. 
This 
will 
include: 
a 
Policy 
review 
and formulation; 
re-examination 
of 
Bangladesh's 
WTO 
commitments 
and 
preparation 
of

made 
under 
the 
current 
policy 
and

a 
new policy 
to

GOB’S 
telecommunications 
offer 
to 
the 
WTO 
will 
be

assistance 
support 
will 
also 
be 
utilized 
for 
institutionalizing 
processes 
and procedures 
for 
policy 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
within 
MOPT.

universal 
basket 
of 
services regardless 
of

Fiscal 
Impact 
of 
Sector 
Reform 
BANGLADESH: Telecommunications Technical Assistance Project 
Method 
and 
Approach 
1. 
The 
fiscal 
impact 
analysis measures 
BTTB’s 
annual 
contribution to 
the 
national 
treasury 
before 
and after 
the 
restructuring. 
Historically, 
BTTB 
has 
produced 
a 
significant 
revenue 
surplus 
(cash revenues 
less 
cash 
expenditures) that 
is 
transferred 
to 
the 
treasury, 
which 
in 
turn 
funds 
BTTB’s 
annual investment 
requirements. 
To 
fully 
measure 
the 
impact, 
the 
analysis 
not 
only 
considers 
the 
revenue 
surplus 
but 
also 
all 
the 
other 
transfers 
BTTB, 
as 
a 
limited 
company, 
it 
will 
be 
obligated 
to 
make 
to 
the 
treasury. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
standard 
revenue 
surplus 
and 
investment 
flows, 
the 
analysis 
includes 
the 
following: 
VAT 
Import 
Duties 
and 
levies 
- 
average 
of 
15% 
(ranging 
from 
10-42.5%) 
Municipal 
taxes (estimate 
not 
available at 
this 
time.) 
MOPT/BTRC 
fees 
(8% 
of 
gross service 
revenues) 
Other 
transfers 
(employee 
taxes, 
etc.) 
(10% 
of 
employee 
salaries 
and 
wages) 
. 
Corporate 
Tax 
- 
45% 
. 
9 
. 
* 
2. 
sector 
reforms 
(regulation, 
tariffs, 
interconnection, 
competition, licensing, 
etc.) 
will 
greatly 
influence 
the 
size, 
shape 
and 
direction 
of 
the 
sector 
in 
the 
next few 
years.  Because 
of 
all 
the 
changes 
that 
are 
taking 
place 
simultaneously 
in 
the 
sector, an estimate 
of 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
BTTB’s 
restructuring 
factors 
in 
all 
of 
these 
other 
elements. 
A 
financial 
and operational 
model 
of 
the 
sector 
reform 
and 
the 
assumptions 
used 
are 
provided 
in 
the 
project 
files. 
The 
analysis also 
goes 
beyond 
the 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB. 
The 
restructuring 
of 
BTTB 
and 
the 
on-going 
Direct 
and 
Immediate 
Cash 
Flow 
Impact 
3. 
Currently, 
BTTB 
bank 
accounts 
are 
government 
accounts 
and 
thus 
it 
does 
not 
take 
possession 
of 
its 
cash 
collections. 
Local 
cash 
receipts 
are 
collected 
at 
various 
local 
banks 
and post 
offices 
and most international 
settlements 
are 
directly 
deposited 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
accounts 
both 
domestically and 
in 
foreign 
banks. 
Essentially 
the 
government 
controls 
all 
of 
BTTB’s 
cash 
receipts 
(approximately 
US 
$700,000 
per 
day) 
and 
uses 
these 
funds 
to 
manage 
the 
overall 
government’s 
daily 
cash 
requirements. 
Once 
BTTB 
is 
restructured, 
it 
will 
set 
up 
its 
own 
bank 
accounts 
and 
take 
full 
control 
of 
its 
cash 
flow. 
The direct and immediate 
impact 
on 
the government 
is 
that 
it 
will 
have 
to 
manage 
its 
daily 
cash 
needs 
without 
BTTB’s 
daily 
cash. 
Rather 
than 
provide daily 
cash 
infusions 
to 
the 
government, 
BTTB 
will 
make 
the 
standard 
transfers 
(e.g. 
corporate 
tax, 
VAT) 
at 
the 
standard 
times 
(monthly, 
quarterly, 
or 
annually). 
The 
conversion 
of 
BTTB 
to 
a 
limited 
company 
will 
have 
an immediate 
cash 
flow 
impact 
on 
the 
treasury. 
Key 
Findings 
4. 
As 
described 
above, the 
government 
will 
experience 
an immediate 
cash 
flow 
impact 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
restructure 
process, 
but 
the 
overall 
magnitude 
of 
the 
contribution 
may not 
be 
as 
severely 
impacted. 
The 
following 
table 
demonstrates 
that 
the 
treasury 
can 
potentially 
gain more 
(net 
cash), 
year-over-year 
from 
BTTB 
as 
a 
limited 
company. 
The 
net 
amount 
that 
is 
actually 
transferred 
to 
the treasury 
depends 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
on 
the 
level 
of 
investment made 
by 
BTTB 
and 
how 
this 
is 
funded. 
It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
note 
that 
beginning 
in 
2003 
the 
mobile 
operators 
begin 
to 
provide 
more to 
the 
national 
treasury than 
BTTB, 
even 
though 
it 
is 
assumed 
the 
mobile 
operators 
have 
been 
granted a 
tax holiday 
through 
2006. 
In 
the 
High 
Growth 
scenario,

MOPT/BTRC 
As 
a 
limited 
company, 
BTTB 
will 
pay 
the 
standard 
taxes 
and 
transfers 
as 
demonstrated 
above, and 
will 
fund 
its 
capital projects through 
its 
own 
budget constraints rather 
than 
through 
the 
govemment’s 
Annual 
Development 
Budget. 
The 
government 
as 
a 
100% 
owner 
of 
BTTB 
will 
have 
to 
decide 
on 
the 
level 
of 
capital 
it 
will 
contribute (or can afford) 
for 
BTTB’s 
expansion program.  Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
10-year 
financial 
planning model 
and 
assumptions 
used, 
the 
net 
revenue 
surplus 
now 
being 
contributed 
by 
BTTB 
to 
the 
national 
treasury 
will 
be 
more than 
offset 
by 
the 
collection 
of 
the 
standard taxes 
and 
duties 
paid 
by 
a 
limited 
company.

Since 
the 
contracts’ 
sizes 
are 
small 
and shopping 
is 
the 
preferred 
method, 
IDA 
will 
carry 
out 
prior

of 
the 
first 
two 
contracts 
for 
shopping 
under 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC. 
Review 
will 
include: 
request 
for 
quotations, 
evaluation 
of 
quotations and 
the 
purchase 
order. 
If 
NCB 
is 
used, 
one 
contract 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
prior

Review 
of 
Procurement 
Performance

IDA 
will 
monitor 
the 
compliance 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
Bank's different 
procurement methods 
and 
performance 
standards 
on 
a continuous 
basis. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
project's planned 
mid-term 
review, 
a 
comprehensive 
assessment 
of 
procurement performance 
will 
also 
be 
carried 
out.  Based 
on 
the 
review, 
in 
consultant 
with 
the government, 
IDA 
may

Procurement 
Issues. 
The 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR), 
broadly 
accepted 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
February 
2001, 
stated 
poor 
procurement 
as 
a generic 
problem 
in 
Bangladesh. 
The 
CPAR 
identified 
a 
series 
of 
factors 
accounting 
for 
procurement problems 
in 
the 
country 
that, among 
others, 
include 
absence 
of 
procurement 
law, 
poor 
advertisement, 
poor 
bidding 
documents, 
multiple 
evaluation 
committees, 
award 
of 
contract 
through lottery, 
negotiations, 
lack 
of 
professional 
competence, 
corrupt 
practices, 
political 
influence 
and 
pressure 
from 
special 
interest 
groups 
and 
collective 
bargaining 
agencies. 
The 
CPAR 
recommended 
for 
procurement 
reform 
with 
a 
series 
of 
action 
and 
the 
Government 
has 
received 
a 
Technical 
Assistance

institutional

management 
capacity 
of 
the 
Implementing 
Agencies 
(IAs), 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC. 
Both 
the 
IAs 
have 
limited 
experience 
implementing 
donor 
funded 
projects, 
with 
no 
experience 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
World 
Bank 
financed 
projects. 
It 
is 
critical 
to 
build 
capacity 
within 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC. 
Given 
the 
current 
assignment 
of 
staff 
in 
both 
the 
agencies, 
it 
is 
assessed 
that 
the 
capacity 
at 
the 
present 
time 
will 
not 
be 
sufficient to 
implement 
the 
project 
and 
should 
be 
enhanced. 
The 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
with 
a 
view 
to: 
(i) 
evaluate 
the 
capability 
of 
the 
IAs 
and 
of 
the 
adequacy 
of 
procurement 
systems 
in 
place 
to 
administer Bank-financed 
procurement; 
(ii) 
assess 
the 
risks 
that 
may 
negatively affect 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
IAs 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
procurement 
process; 
and 
(iii) 
develop 
an action 
plan 
to 
be 
implemented 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project to 
address 
deficiencies. 
The 
assessment 
included 
organization 
aspects, 
skills 
of 
staff 
and 
suitability 
of 
rules 
and 
regulations 
applicable 
to 
the 
agencies. 
The 
inexperience 
of 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
in 
implementation 
of 
World 
Bank 
financed 
projects, 
coupled 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR), 
would 
constitute 
a 
“high” 
procurement 
risk,

to 
enhance

capacity 
and 
mitigate 
the 
weaknesses 
identified 
are 
summarized 
below. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
financial

capacity 
of 
the

agencies was 
carried 
Ministry

Ministry 
of 
Finance 
render 
accounting 
services 
to 
the 
ministry 
and 
its 
departments. 
CAO 
(Posts 
Offices) 
looks 
after 
the 
financial 
and accounting 
needs 
of 
the 
ministry 
and 
its 
Post 
Office 
Department. 
CAO 
(T&T) 
releases 
any 
GOB 
fund 
for 
Bangladesh Telephone 
& 
Telegraph 
Board 
(BTTB) 
and 
compiles and 
consolidates 
the 
total 
income and 
expenditure 
of 
BTTB 
as 
recorded 
in 
various 
BTTB 
offices 
and 
some 
special 
bank 
accounts. 
Both 
the 
CAOs 
are 
accountable 
to 
the 
Secretary 
MOPT 
who 
is 
responsible 
to 
the 
Parliament 
as 
the 
Principal Accounting 
Officer 
of 
the 
Ministry. 
During 
Bank’s 
project 
preparation mission’s 
discussion 
with 
the 
MOPT, 
it 
was agreed 
that 
the 
CAO 
(T&T) 
would 
be 
the 
designated 
office 
to 
release 
the 
GOB 
fund 
of 
the 
project. 
Since 
it 
was 
assessed 
that 
the 
project 
accounting 
function 
could 
not 
be 
performed 
under an 
internal 
arrangement 
of 
CAO, 
MOPT 
has 
included 
in 
its 
TAPP 
a 
need 
to recruit 
an 
accountant 
for 
the 
project. 
IDA 
observed 
that the 
level 
of 
accountant 
proposed 
in 
the 
TAPP 
was 
not 
appropriate 
to 
attract 
the 
required 
skill 
to 
perform 
the 
project 
accounting 
function 
adequately 
and 
recommended that 
MOPT 
make appropriate 
revision to 
its 
TAPP 
proposal 
during 
its 
review 
process 
by 
the 
Planning 
Commission 
so 
that 
an Accounts 
Officer 
could 
be 
hired 
for 
the 
project.

BTRC 
is 
maintaining 
manual 
registers 
and 
ledgers 
and 
producing 
the 
financial 
statements 
using 
MS 
Excel 
worksheets. 
It 
has 
just 
completed 
the 
first 
year 
of 
operation and 
its 
ledgers and registers 
for 
financial 
activities, accounting documentation 
for 
transactions and 
internal 
control 
measures 
need 
to 
be 
improved. 
BTRC 
is 
considering 
introduction 
of 
a 
computerized accounting 
system 
for 
efficiently 
recording, analyzing and 
reporting 
its 
transactions. 
BTRC 
is 
awaiting 
the 
budgetary approval 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
computerization along 
with 
the 
MIS 
system, 
which 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
budget 
estimate 
for 
FY2004. 
1.4 
Auditing: 
BTRC 
is 
required to 
prepare 
its 
annual 
accounts 
and 
financial 
statements 
within 
60 
days 
from 
the 
end 
of 
a 
fiscal 
year 
and 
within 
the 
next 
60 
days 
get 
these 
audited 
by 
a 
firm 
of 
Chartered 
Accountants and 
submit 
such 
audited 
statements 
to 
MOPT 
for 
their 
presentation 
in 
the 
parliament. 
BTRC 
submitted 
its 
first 
audited 
financial 
statements 
for 
the 
period 
from 
January 
3 
1 
to 
June 
30,2002 to 
MOPT 
well 
within 
the 
prescribed 
time 
limit. 
BTRC 
being 
a 
statutory 
public body 
also comes 
under 
the 
purview 
of 
audit 
by 
the 
Comptroller 
and 
Auditor 
General (C&AG) 
but 
no 
such 
audit 
has 
been 
taken 
up 
as 
yet.

of 
the 
Government 
of

However, 
BTRC 
is 
empowered 
by 
the

to 
the 
Government’s  approval,

properly reflect 
the 
financial 
position 
of 
BTRC. 
BTRC 
plans 
to opt 
for Accrual 
Basis 
of 
Accounting 
that 
would 
comply 
with 
the 
International Accounting 
Standards. 
Various 
revenues 
of 
BTRC 
that 
are 
presently 
recognized 
on 
collection 
basis 
would 
be 
advisable 
to 
be recognized 
on 
accrual 
basis 
to 
keep 
track 
of 
accounts receivables, 
for 
efficient 
budgeting 
and 
effective 
performance 
measurement. 
1.6 
Staffing 
and 
Capacity: 
Finance 
and 
Accounting 
Unit 
of 
BTRC 
presently 
has 
three 
core 
accounting 
personnel 
in 
the 
positions 
of 
Deputy Director, 
Assistant 
Director 
and Accountant 
reporting to 
the 
Director, 
Administration 
and 
Accounts. 
BTRC 
has 
recently 
requested 
the government 
approval 
for 
additional 
manpower 
that 
includes 
one 
Assistant 
Director 
(Finance 
and 
Revenue) 
and 
a 
cashier. 
The 
recruitment 
to 
these 
proposed positions 
will 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
management 
and 
internal 
control 
environment. 
All 
the 
existing 
personnel 
have 
the 
adequate 
knowledge 
to 
carry 
on 
the 
day-to-day 
affairs 
but 
need 
the 
guidance 
and advice 
from 
a 
qualified 
accountant 
with 
adequate 
experience 
in 
setting 
up 
and 
smoothly 
operating 
an 
appropriate 
Financial 
Management 
System. 
The 
key 
position 
of 
Director, 
Administration 
and 
Accounts 
was 
recently 
filled 
by 
an 
official 
with 
experience 
in 
administration. 
BTRC 
needs 
to 
have 
the 
services 
of 
a 
qualified 
accountant 
with 
adequate 
and relevant 
experience 
so 
that 
financial 
management 
system 
with 
well 
defined 
rules 
and 
procedures, adequate 
documentation and 
internal control 
measures 
for 
transactions and 
an 
efficient 
accounting and 
reporting 
system 
is 
be 
quickly 
established 
and 
sustained 
in 
BTRC. 
As 
agreed 
during 
appraisal, 
the 
Project 
Management Consultant 
(PMC) 
will 
have 
in 
its 
team, 
a 
financial 
management 
expert 
with 
professional accounting qualifications 
and 
adequate 
experience 
to look 
after 
the 
project’s 
accounting 
needs 
in 
both 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC 
and 
also 
to 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
of 
BTRC. 
The 
PMC 
will 
define 
the 
financial 
management 
needs 
of 
BTRC 
and 
design 
and 
implement 
a 
computerized accounting 
system. 
It 
will 
also 
provide 
adequate 
training to 
all 
financial 
management 
staff to 
transfer 
skills 
and knowledge 
to 
sustain an 
adequate 
system 
in 
BTRC. 
The 
scope 
of 
work 
and 
the 
qualification 
requirement 
would 
be 
adequately 
reflected 
in 
the 
revised 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
PMC.

Hiring 
of 
an 
Assistant 
Director 
(Finance

would

BTRC 
Fund: 
BTRC 
is 
required to maintain 
a

that 
would

budget 
estimate 
for 
the 
next fiscal

specifying 
the amount 
required 
from 
the government and other 
source 
of 
finance 
to 
meet 
its 
revenue 
and 
capital 
expenditures. 
Before 
the 
commencement 
of 
a 
fiscal 
year, 
the 
government 
would 
accord 
its 
approval 
to 
the 
commission’s 
budget 
with 
or without 
revisions 
to 
the 
estimates. 
Budget 
for 
FY2003 
was 
approved 
with 
Tk. 
910 
million 
as 
its 
income 
and 
Tk.16.2 
million 
as 
the 
expenses, 
leaving 
a 
net 
surplus 
of 
Tk. 
893.8 
million. 
BTRC 
did 
not 
ask 
for 
any government 
grant 
for 
its 
operation and 
it 
can invest 
its 
fund 
in 
any 
project 
with 
the 
government’s 
approval. 
Budgetary 
Control: 
Every

BTRC

Although 
BTRC 
being 
a 
recently 
created 
entity 
does 
not 
have 
the 
institutional 
experience 
in 
the 
management 
of 
bank 
financed 
projects, 
it 
has 
inherited 
the 
capacity 
to 
manage 
the 
disbursements 
from 
the

as 
the 
designated 
Project 
Director 
and 
the 
Deputy 
Director 
(Accounts)  have 
been 
working 
with 
the 
erstwhile 
BTRC

of 
the

MOPT’s 
inexperience 
in 
the disbursement 
management 
of 
Bank

projects 
would 
be 
addressed 
by 
PMC 
having 
in

a

expert 
with 
appropriate 
experience. 
Transaction

The 
government 
will 
provide 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Credit 
as 
grant 
to 
both 
MOPT 
and 
BTRC. 
The 
government 
would 
ensure 
timely 
availability 
of 
its 
share 
of 
project 
funding. 
The
