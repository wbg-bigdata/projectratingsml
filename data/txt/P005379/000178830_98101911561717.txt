SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) is a mature
DFC, and has so far received seven Bank loans totalling $141 million. BNDE
plays a key role in the financing of industrial development in Morocco, both
in the private and public sector, and has been entrusted by the Government to
evaluate and advise on all industrial loans requiring term financing under the
provision of the Industrial Code.
ii.       During 1973-1976, Morocco achieved a 6% growth rate of GDP in real
terms. The average growth of the whole industrial sector during 1973-76 is
estimated at 10% p.a., in line with the 1973-77 Plan targets. Private invest-
ment in manufacturing and the processing industry (excluding construction and
transport) increased from about DH 754 million in 1973 to over DH 1,300 mil-
lion in 1976. Public investment in the sector increased even more dramatic-
ally, from DH 77 million in 1973 to DR 712 million in 1976, reflecting the
increased importance of such investments in the sector.
iii.      BNDE's operations have reflected the general upsurge in industrial
investments, and its direct loan approvals have more than quadrupled in the
last three years, increasing from DH 147 million in 1973 to DH 696 million in
1976. Privately sponsored projects, although they increased in absolute terms,
decreased in relative terms to 45% during 1974-76, compared to 75% of total
approvals during 1959-73.
iv.       BNDE's adherence to undertakings agreed with the Bank under previous
loans has been satisfactory. Operationally BNDE has also performed generally
well, and the quality of its appraisals has continued to improve and is satis-
factory.  Commitments and disbursements of the last two Bank loans are in line
with expectations at the time of their appraisals.
v.        The staffing of BNDE, under capable management, is considered satis-
factory.  BNDE has increased its staff to cope with the increased workload, but
a further increase will be necessary. The appraisal of large, complex projects
has posed new demands, particularly also for technical expertise.
vi.       BNDE is actively seeking new shareholders interested in playing an
active role in developing the Moroccan economy, and prepared to assist in for-
eign equity and loan investments in the country. This initiative is welcomed,
as is BNDE's increasing emphasis on promotion inside the country.
vii.      A significant new activity of BNDE will be its leading role in the
promotion of small scale industries (SSI), in cooperation with a commercial
bank, and using up to $5 million in Bank funds. The SSI have a high employment



- ii -
potential, but in the past have not been very actively promoted, or supported.
A pilot project to be initiated and supervised by BNDE will not only help SSI
development, but also may provide the experimental basis required for preparing
a much larger project in this field. The pilot project will be supported by a
sector study of SSI.
viii.     BNDE has been quite successful in mobilizing and diversifying the
resources required by its increased volume of activities during 1974-75.
However, in 1976, as Morocco ran into unforeseen balance of payments problems,
BNDE was unable to meet its resource commitments, and ended 1976 with a re-
source gap of DH 168 million. The Bank has urged BNDE to accelerate its
resource mobilization, and BNDE has since prepared a balanced resource mobili-
zation plan covering the period 1977 to mid-1979.
ix.       While BNDE's financial position and performance in the last three
years have, in general, been satisfactory, the increased volume of business
and related borrowing needs have affected BNDE's term debt/equity ratio which
has increased to 10.5:1 at end 1976. As previously agreed with the Bank, BNDE
should maintain a conventional debt/equity ratio below 10:1 from 1978 onwards.
In order to achieve this, BNDE will double its capital in 1977; this is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
x.        In order to remunerate the increased share capital, BNDE will im-
prove its profits by increasing its nominal interest rate from 10% to 11% on
its long-term loans. This will increase the effective cost of BNDE funds to
subborrowers from 9% to 10%, taking into account the Government rebate of two
points on industrial term loans and various fees and charges of 1% p.a.
xi.       BNDE expects to maintain its future business in real terms at about
the 1976 level, and to continue providing its financing for both private and
public projects. BNDE's expected commitments would amount to DH 2.8 billion
in 1977-80, and its projected resource requirements would amount to DH 2.2
billion through December 31, 1979. Based on BNDE's financing plan for the
period covered by the proposed loan (1977-mid-1979) a resource gap of DH 216
million remains to be filled; the proposed Bank loan would reduce the resource
gap to DH 13 million. The Bank would be providing about 10% of BNDE's projected
resource needs in 1977-mid-1979 (commitment basis). The proportion of Bank
funds in BNDE's outstanding borrowings,which was 42% in 1974 and 20% in 1976,
would decline further to 13% by the end of 1979.
xii.      The projected financial position and performance, which are based
on conservative assumptions, show an improving situation. BNDE's profit
before taxes, provisions and reserves would more than quadruple in 1977-81,
yielding 28% on average equity in 1981 compared to 23% in 1975. BNDE would
have no problem in maintaining or even increasing its present 8% dividend
rate. The resulting reserve build-up coupled with a doubling of the share
capital would help maintain a sound financial structure, well within the
agreed term debt/equity ratio of 10:1.
xiii.     BNDE continues to remain a suitable recipient for the proposed Bank
loan of $45 million; up to $5 million would be allocated to an SSI pilot
project. The proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule, with
subloans not to exceed 15 years, including three years of grace.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) was
established in 1959, and received its first loan from the World Bank in 1962.
BNDE has so far received seven Bank loans totalling $141 million 1/. The
most recent Bank loan, 1061-MOR, was signed in December, 1974 2/, and was
fully committed in October, 1976.
1.02      Although BNDE has been successful in mobilizing substantial addi-
tional resources from diverse sources, it needs further funds to fulfill its
role in the expanding Moroccan economy. This report appraises BNDE for an
eighth loan of $45 million, which includes a $5 million component for a
pilot project for the promotion of small-scale industries.
1.03      Through the proposed loan, the Bank will assist BNDE in:
(i)  providing continuing support for the development of the
industrial sector in Morocco, both with respect to the
private and public sector;
(ii)  expanding its promotional and development efforts, with
emphasis on labor-intensive small-scale industries (SSI)
for which a pilot project will be created;
(iii)  mobilizing additional resources, particularly in the
international market;
(iv)  strengthening its institutional appraisal capabilities,
particularly with respect to larger and more complex
projects, in line with the demands made on BNDE by the
evolving trend of industrial development in Morocco.
1.04      The proposed loan of $45 million equivalent would meet 10% of
the additional resources required by BNDE (commitment basis) for the period
1977-1979.

II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. Economic Situation
2.01      A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Morocco" (1021-MOR, dated January 26, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on February 13, 1976. An updating economic mission visited Morocco
in June 1976, and the report is to be issued in June, 1977.
B. Manufacturing Sector
2.02      The Third Plan 1973-77 aimed at a growth rate of the manufacturing
and the processing industry of about 10% through an acceleration of industrial
exports, and also through continued import substitution in the food processing,
textile, metal working and chemical industries. The Government sought to at-
tain these objectives by providing additional stimuli for the private industry
(such as the new Industrial Investment Code promulgated in 1973, granting
industrial investors a 2 point interest rebate, tax exemptions, etc.), and by
developing public and semi-public enterprises, which were expected to absorb
up to 70% of total investment during the Third Plan period. The Government
investment strategy was made possible by increased phosphate revenues which
permitted more ambitious public investment programs, and was prompted by the
limited investment potential of the private sector in comparison to Government
development objectives.
2.03      The objective of reviving private investment has been largely
achieved. Private investment in manufacturing and processing industry (ex-
cluding construction and transport) increased from about DH 754 million in
1973 to over DH 1,300 million in 1976. Public investment in the sector
increased even more dramatically, from DH 77 million in 1973 to about 712
million in 1976. Total industrial investment (public and private), is
currently estimated at DH 8 billion for the 1973-77 Third Plan period. To
stimulate capacity utilization, exports were promoted; as a result, the ex-
ports of finished products increased from DH 426 million in 1972 to DH 563
million in 1973, and to DH 795 million in 1975. An increase of 10% in these
exports is estimated for 1976.
2.04      Policies and measures to sustain and expand industrial growth in
general since 1973 have so far been effective, since the 10% p.a. growth
target of the Third Plan is being achieved. The growth of the manufacturing
sector alone has been somewhat less than expected, since its growth averaged
only about 7% p.a. during the 1973-76 period; its share in GDP remained at
about 13% throughout the period. The prospects for 1977, and for the Fourth
Plan period (1978-82), are discussed in Chapter VII.

C. Financial Community
2.05      Morocco's institutional finance system comprises (i) 15 commercial
banks with extensive regional coverage through a combined network of nearly
400 branches; (ii) 5 specialized institutions, including BNDE; and (iii) 2
savings banks. Long-term finance is provided to private investors principally
through three institutions, the agricultural bank (CNCA), the housing and
tourism bank (CIH), and the industrial bank (BNDE), each of which services
its respective sectors and has received Bank loans. The Banque du Maroc is
Morocco's Central Bank. Morocco has a relatively developed capital market
centered at the Casablanca stock exchange, where gold, bonds, shares and
government securities are traded. There is also an active inter-bank market,
which is free of Central Bank control.
2.06      BNDE derives its key position from being the only financial insti-
tution authorized to provide industrial projects, broadly defined 1/, with
contractual long-term financing under the 1973 Industrial Investment Code.
In addition, BNDE plays a major role in the distribution of medium-term loans
by commercial banks to the industrial sector, especially for the benefit of
smaller industrial enterprises. Medium-term loans for industry, initially
extended by commercial banks, may be rediscounted with the Central Bank only
if appraised and approved by BNDE. These loans have terms up to five years,
and bear an effective interest of 8.0% to the final borrower. The Central
Bank's rediscount rate is currently 4.5%, and BNDE's commission for processing
and approving rediscounted loans is 0.75%. The primary risk of default is
borne by the commercial bank, with BNDE guaranteeing only against the risk
that the commercial bank may fail to pay the Central Bank. Since the possi-
bility of such defaults is remote, BNDE bears practically no risk.
D. Interest Rates
2.07      The Government continues to strictly control the institutional in-
terest rates in Morocco. There has been upward movement of the interest rates
in the 1970's, including rates in the active bond market and increases in
BNDE's long-term lending rate from 7% to 10%. The lending interest rate
structure in Morocco is shown in Annex 3, and ranges from 4.5% (special export
credits) to 11% (for certain non-rediscountable medium and long-term credits).
2.08      The interest rate charged by BNDE consists of a nominal rate, 10%
at present, to which must be added various annual charges equivalent to about
1% of the outstanding loan amount. Since industrial borrowers receive a
direct rebate of 2% per year from the Government, the effective rate is thus
1/   Including transportation (shipping and airlines), ocean fishing and
mining, but excluding energy.



- 4 -
9%. It should be noted that the effective rate (including charges) was only
8Z until July 1975, when the rate was raised to 9% as agreed with the Bank at
the time of the seventh loan negotiations.
2.09      BNDE and the Government have agreed during negotiations to an
increase in BNDE's nominal interest rate from 10% to 11% on new long-term
loans (i.e. loans with maturities over seven years), thereby bringing the
effective rate to 10%.  Such an increase in interest rate would help to
improve the profitability of BNDE, as is required in view of the agreed
increase in the share capital (para 5.06), and as an inducement to attract
more foreign capital. In line with the explanation given in para 2.08, and
taking into account the existing and projected inflation rate 1/, this would
ensure that subborrowers pay a positive interest rate of about 3%. Medium-
term loans will continue to carry a lower effective interest rate of 9%
so as to maintain comparable, competitive rates with other commercial banks;
less than 20% of BNDE's projected loan commitments would be in the form of
medium-term loans so defined.
2.10      In reviewing BNDE's interest rate structure, the justification
of the 2% rebate and the Government carrying the foreign exchange risk were
also questioned. The Government views the rebate (together with other
incentives under the Industrial Code) as well as protection of investors
from foreign exchange risks as indispensable for maintaining a favorable
investment climate in Morocco. It is not prepared to pass on the foreign
exchange risk to subborrowers, nor to abolish the rebate at this time, as
these measures appear to help investments to expand at the desired rate.
The Government is nevertheless concerned with the cost and effecttlbeness
of rebates, and is from time to time reviewing these (e.g. Maritime Code);
however, it does not consider that a downward adjustment of the rebate would
be appropriate. The questions of interest rate, rebates and foreign exchange
risk have been points of discussion with the Bank for years. The agreed in-
crease to 11% in BNDE's long-term lending rate is a significant step, - the
only one the Government will consider at this time -, and seems sufficient
at this stage to help prevent misallocation of BNDE's long-term resources.
III. BNDE'S ORGANIZATION AND POLICIES
Organization
3.01      BNDE has its headquarters in Rabat, and a small regional office in
Casablanca for promotional purposes. BNDE is strengthening its Casablanca
office and establishing two additional promotional offices, in Agadir and
Oujda, for closer contacts with local entrepreneurs.
1/   Inflation in Morocco was running at a modest 2.4% p.a. average over the
period 1968-72, but is expected to average 8.2% for the period 1973-77,
and 7.2% p.a. for 1978-82.



3.02      A list of BNDE's shareholders as of January 1, 1977, is given in
Annex 3.  In 1975, and in line with an agreement reached with the Bank, BNDE
increased its share capital from DH 32.4 million to DH 70 million.  The share
capital issue was well received, and shares available to domestic investors
were oversubscribed. No major changes in institutions represented on the
Board (Annex 4) have taken place since the last appraisal in 1974, although
there have been changes in personalities. The Board has continued to dis-
play a considerable amount of initiative, and is active in policy anid invest-
ment matters. The Executive Committee meets once a month and has received
authority from the Board to approve loans up to DH 4 million. IFC is
represented on both the Board and the Executive Committee.
3.03      There has been remarkable stability in BNDE's senior management and
organisation since the last Bank appraisal in 1974 (Annex 5). Credit must
be given to the President and General Manager, Mr. Faris, for keeping a
capable management team together.
3.04      In line with the growth in operations, BNDE's staff has expanded
from 48 professionals in 1974 to 60 professionals by end 1976, including four
young engineers. A further strengthening of BNDE's staff is required to
improve quality standards under increased workloads. BNDE has agreed to
recruit five more financial analysts/economists, and a further three--hopefully
experienced--engineers; the latter are required to further improve the tech-
nical appraisal work, and assist with more frequent supervision of'projects.
Operational Policies
3.05      BNDE's Policy Statement has not changed since the last appraisal,
and is still considered satisfactory. The appraisals prepared by BNDE are,
in general, of good quality. BNDE calculates the effective rate of protec-
tion, as well as the economic rate of return for projects with more than 50%
effective protection rate or for which BNDE's financing exceeds DH 5 million.
For the proposed loan, BNDE has agreed to calculate the economic tate of
return for all projects financed with Bank funds (except for SSI sub-loans,
see Chapter VI), but will no longer be required to calculate the effective
rate of protection separately. For other projects, BNDE will also calculate
the economic rate of return for loans above DH 5 million.
BNDE's Role in Financing Large-Scale Enterprises
3.06      The appraisals of large-scale projects recently completed by BNDE
have been closely checked. A few of these projects, in the public sector,
were rejected by BNDE because of insufficient profitability, and in one case
a Government subsidy was eliminated on the basis of BNDE's appraisal. In the
other projects, BNDE participated in various degrees during the formulation
of the project, often in close cooperation with Office de Developpement
Industriel (ODI) and other Government agencies. In a few cases BNDE's
appraisal of large-scale projects has been less than satisfactory, mainly
due to staff constraints and inexperience and, more importantly, to the fact
that its assistance has been requested at times when all key decisions in a
project had already been taken.



- 6 -
3.07      To play a useful role in evaluating large-scale projects, and con-
tribute financial, economic and technical expertise, BNDE must be involved
at the earliest possible stage of project formulation. BNDE has now decided
that it will not normally consider financing of large-cale projects brought
to BNDE's attention after the engineering contract has been completed, or the
construction contract has been signed.
Fishing Industry and Merchant Marine
3.08      BNDE has been officially designated to act as the sole long-term
financing agency for the fishing industry and merchant marine.  Due to the
favorable incentives granted by the Government for the purchase of ships
(subsidy in investment cost of up to 30%, and a combined rebate of 6% on
the 10% BNDE interest rate) coupled with apparently profitable prospects,
BNDE is receiving a rapidly increasing number of applications for such
financing, particularly for the purchase of fishing vessels.
3.09      Expansion of Morocco's fishing fleet, particularly in view of the
increase in the territorial fishing rights to 200 miles, and the fishing
potential thereof, is considered reasonable. However, the impact fishing
loans may have on BNDE's portfolio quality must be further evaluated before
larger commitments in this rapidly expanding sector are undertaken, especially
as the generous incentives may be attracting some inexperienced investors;
under the proposed loan, Bank funds will, therefore, not be used for the
purchase of fishing vessels.
Use of Bank Funds
3.10      Taking account of the quality of BNDE's appraisal work, of infla-
tion which has raised the cost of all projects, and the fact that the Bank
would like to concentrate its supervision on large projects, it was agreed
to raise the free limit from US$0.9 million (DH 4 million) to US$2 million
(DH 9 million), with no aggregate free limit.
3.11      Under the condition of the seventh loan, the use of Bank funds in
any single enterprise was limited to US$4 million, and the aggregate use
of Bank funds for investment projects owned to the extent of 50% or Tore by
the Government was restricted to 40% of the total loan proceeds. In view of
the price inflation which has taken place since 1974, and taking accoWnt of
BNDE's increased outstanding loan portfolio (Annex 13), it was agreed to
increase the exposure limit to $6 million. However, the amount of any single
sub-project commitment under the proposed eighth loan would still be limited
to $4 million. The limitation of 40% on investments in public sector projects
with Bank funds, as stipulated in the previous loan agreement, is maintained.
3.12      Supervision.  BNDE's supervision reports have improved since the
last appraisal, but the technical supervision has been somewhat limited due
to staff constraints. The newly-hired four engineers, as well as the pro-
posed further increases in staff, should enable future supervisions to be
more frequent and the reports to be more complete.



3.13      Procurement and Disbursement.  BNDE does not normally insist on
international competitive bidding procedures, but its procurement policy has
been satisfactory and in line with that of other Bank-supported development
banks. Equipment supplies for projects are procured from a wide variety of
suppliers and countries. Disbursement procedures are satisfactory.
3.14      Sector Work.  BNDE's Economic Studies Department (Annex 5) not only
supports the appraisal work, but also undertakes and publishes industrial
product and sector studies. In 1975 a total of 53 such studies were published;
a sample survey of these indicated professionally competent work.
3.15      Promotional Activities.  BNDE's promotional activities are through
(i) sector studies; (ii) publication of brochures and other documentation to
assist local entrepreneurs; (iii) assisting in establishing a capital market
by participating in equity investment; and (iv) promotion of Moroccan industry,
and investment opportunities therein, abroad. In respect to the last point,
BNDE places great emphasis on the role its own foreign shareholders could per-
form. BNDE intends to further expand its promotional role by establishing two
new regional offices, and by assisting in the development of SSI. Considering
these efforts, the promotional work done by BNDE is considered satisfactory
and of importance for the industrial sector.
IV. BNDE'S OPERATIONS
4.01      In line with its Policy Statement, BNDE's operations consist of
direct medium- and long-term loans, rediscounted medium-term loans, and
equity investments. The following analysis of BNDE's operations is based
on Annexes 6-9.
A. Characteristics of Operations
4.02      BNDE's direct loan approvals have more than quadrupled since 1973
and reached DH 696 million for 1976. Rediscounted loan approvals have
increased five-fold since 1973, representing 35% of BNDE's 1976 total opera-
tions, compared to 29% in 1973.

4.03      The fast growth of BNDE's operations during 1974-76 is in line with
the growth of gross fixed investment, particularly in the industrial sector
(para 2.03). The investment codes of August 1973 gave further impetus to
industrial investments as reflected by industrial investment approvals by
the Ministry of Industry (Annex 6).
4.04      The average size of direct loans reached DH 9 million during the
1974-76 period. Whereas most of BNDE's loans to medium-sized industry averaged
7 years, the large-size projects require longer terms (Annex 7). The general
increase in the size and terms of BNDE's direct loan volume partly reflects
Morocco's industrial investment strategy, which increasingly emphasizes,
projects based on domestic raw materials (e.g. chemicals and cement), many
of which are capital intensive.
4.05      Rediscounted loans are at present limited by law to a maximum
five-year duration. BNDE cannot discount its own medium-term loans. For
approving, and guaranteeing medium-term loans offered by the commercial
banks for rediscounting to the Central Bank, BNDE collects a 0.75% fee.
4.06      During the period 1959 1/-73, about 75% of the amount of BNDE's
approvals were in the private sector. However, during the 1974-76 period
private sector approvals decreased to 45% as publicly sponsored projects,
in line with corresponding upward revisions in the Development Plan, became
increasingly more prominent. Nevertheless, there has not been a slow down
in the absolute level of private loan approvals, which grew from DH 307
million in 1974 to DH 559 million in 1976, an increase of 82%. Following
the Moroccanization laws of 1973, loan approvals for foreign-controlled
enterprises, which accounted for 38% of total approvals during 1959/73,
have dwindled to insignificant levels (7% in 1974, and 1.4% in 1976).
4.07      During the period 1974-76, a total of 67% of BNDE's approvals was
for loans to the manufacturing industry (chemicals 15%, food processing 11%,
textiles 10%, cement 7%, others 24%). Transport accounted for 29%, and fishing
for 4%.
4.08      The geographic distribution of BNDE's loans reflects the concentra-
tion of industries in the Casablanca-Mohammedia area. This area was on the
average the beneficiary of 59% of all BNDE's loan and equity investment
approvals during the 1974-76 period (compared to 36% in 1959-73). The balance
of approvals during 1974-1976 was generally well spread over other major urban
centers (i.e. Rabat, Marrakesh, Agadir, Fes, Tanger, etc.).
4.09      During the period 1974-76, BNDE approved 28 new equity investments
for DH 33 million, compared to 54 investments for DH 55 million during the
whole period 1959-73. As of December 31, 1976, BNDE held participations in
33 industrial enterprises, accounting for 66% of total outstanding equity
investments of DH 84 million; in 8 tourism enterprises (15% of total); and
6 financial institutions (19% of total).

B. Evaluation of Performance under Loan 1061-MOR
4.10      During the appraisal of the seventh loan to BNDE (1061-MOR), BNDE
undertook to implement certain steps to meet the objectives of the Bank loan.
As agreed, BNDE doubled its share capital to maintain a strong equity base in
the face of anticipated growth of lendings, and increased its nominal lending
rate by 1% to make sub-borrowers pay an effective rate of 9% 1/, a coat which
was considered at the time to better approximate the real cost of funds. Per-
formance with regard to appraisal and supervision procedures, management and
staffing has been reviewed earlier (Chapter III) and found to be generally
satisfactory.
4.11      Commitments and disbursements of Loan 1061-MOR have overall been
in line with appraisal estimates. Due to the financing of a large number
of medium-sized enterprises (i.e. loans under the individual free limit of
$900,000), BNDE rapidly reached the aggregate free limit of $7 million set at
the time of appraisal of loan 1061-MOR. In view of the improving quality of
BNDE's appraisal reports, and in order to avoid a cumbersome review of every
project presented to the Bank for financing, the Bank agreed to remove the
aggregate free limit on October 23, 1975.
C. Impact of BNDE's Operations
4.12      During the 1974-76 period, the total investment cost of projects
approved by BNDE amounted to an estimated DH 6.4 billion. BNDE's direct loan
and equity approvals, amounting to DH 1.9 billion, are expected to contribute
30%, and rediscounted loan approvals to provide 13.3% of the total estimated
funds required; the balance was to be provided from equity funds, Government
grants, and other loan financing mostly in the form of suppliers' credits.
4.13      A summary of the operations financed under the last two Bank loans
(890-MOR and 1061-MOR - Annexes 8 and 9) is given below.

Export-oriented projects 1/ financed from the above Bank loans, mostly in the
textile and food processing sectors, accounted for some DH 87.7 million or
10% of the estimated total capital cost, and for 13% of Bank ftnds. Fourteen
projects were expected to export between 27% and 100% of their output. The
relatively high cost per job is due to a substantial number of expansions
financed by BNDE, often in capital-intensive industries, which create little
additional employment.
V. BNDE'S FINANCIAL STRUCTURE
A. Resource Position
5.01      Since the previous appraisal, BNDE's resource mobilization efforts
have continued to bear significant results. At the end of 1976, total out-
standing resources had increased by 124% to DH 1,763 million, from DH 786
million in mid-1974.  Total resources mobilized during 1975 amounted to DH 682
million, of which DH 34.4 million through new subscribed shares 2/; DH 474
million in foreign currency loans; DH 100 million in new local (7.5%, 15-year)
bonds; a 30-year loan of DH 50 million at 6.5% from the Treasury; and a DH 20
million 5-year, 6.5% loan from CDG. BNDE resorted successfully for the first
time to an internationally subscribed (8.5%, 8-year) bond issue guaranteed
by the Moroccan Government, and denominated in Saudi Rials (SR 100 million,
equivalent to DH 116 million).
5.02      In 1976, however, the resource mobilization momentum was not main-
tained by BNDE for reasons in large part beyond its control; BNDE contracted
only DH 313 million in new resources (of which DH 273 million in foreign
exchange), less than half the amount mobilized in 1975, and wound up the year
with a resource gap of DH 168 million (Annex 10).
5.03      The problems faced by BNDE were many and varied.  In order to meet
expenditures, the Government resorted to a national bond issue of DH 1,000
million, which reduced the capacity of the domestic financial market for
additional commitments. BNDE entered the Euro-dollar market early in 1976 for
$40 million (DH 180 million), and was about to launch another $100 million
borrowing when it was preempted by a major borrowing by the Office Cherifien
des Phosphates (OCP).
5.04      Some of the objectives pursued by the Bank have been to encourage
BNDE not only to diversify its sources of funds, and thereby decrease its
reliance on Bank funds, but also to assist in increasing the general flow of
1/   Over 25% of output exported.
2/   BNDE distributed DH 3.2 million from reserves as stock dividend,
thus bringing the total issued share capital to DH 70 million.



- 11 -
foreign capital into Morocco, and to mobilize domestic savings and strength-
ening the local capital market. These objectives are progressively being
achieved. The proportion of Bank funds decreased from 42% of total resources
outstanding in mid-1974, to 20% at the end of 1976. Borrowings from institu-
tions in capital surplus Arab countries, which accounted for only 1.4% of
total resources outstanding in July 1974, made up 18% of such resources at
end 1976, having increased from DH 11.2 million to DH 318.2 million.
B. Financial Position and Performance
Financial Position
5.05      BNDE's income statements, cash flow, and balance sheets for the
period 1973-1976, are detailed in Annexes 11, 12 and 13. (Audited statements
for 1976 are not yet available.) During the period 1973-1976, BNDE has more
than doubled its total assets with a net increase of DH 976 million in its
loan and equity portfolio outstanding. A major increase in term borrowings
brought BNDE's term debt to equity ratio to 9.0:1 at December 31, 1975 and
to 10.5:1 at end 1976. The term debt/equity ratio calculated on the basis
agreed with the Bank, where equity includes DH 63.5 million in quasi-equity, 1/
was 6.4:1 compared to the maximum allowable limit of 7:1. In line with the
1061-MOR Bank Loan Agreement the term debt/equity ratio, excluding any refer-
ence to quasi-equity, will be limited to 10:1 from January 1978 onwards.
5.06      This limit is considered acceptable because of the quality of BNDE's
portfolio and the guarantees which the Government provides. This limit has
already been reached, and in order to comply with this agreement a share
capital increase of DH 70 million (i.e. a doubling of the existing capital)
has been agreed to by BNDE. The doubling of the share capital is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Current Position
5.07      At end 1975 BNDE's current ratio stood at 1.5:1 providing it with
a satisfactory current position; the share capital increase in 1975 and the
increase of term debts helped improve the current position (Annex 12). The
resource mobilization constraints of 1976 strained BNDE's current position at
the end of that year, and BNDE had to resort to substantial short-term borrow-
ings to meet its commitments. BNDE's debt service ratio was satisfactory
at 1.2:1 at end 1976, but had ranged between 1.5:1 and 0.7:1 in the period
1973-1975; interest coverage during the same period was between 1.4 and 1.5
(Annex 14). BNDE realizes that it must keep a balanced debt service ratio.
During negotiations BNDE agreed to endeavor to maintain at all times a debt
service ratio above 1:1.
1/   The quasi-equity is defined as that portion of DH 90 million subordinated
Government loans which matures after repayment of Bank loan (890-MOR) to
BNDE.



- 12 -
Profitability
5.08      Although BNDE's average interest spread was reduced from 2.8% in
1975 to 2.5% in 1976 due to the higher cost of borrowings, profits have
increased. The increase in share capital and continued plow-back into re-
serves of a major part of earnings have helped BNDE reduce the average cost
of total resources. Administrative expenses, although having increased in
absolute terms by 12% in 1975 due to the hiring of 12 additional professionals,
remain low in relative terms and have decreased from 1.2% to 0.7% of average
total assets over the same period. Average income from loans has increased
from 8.2% in 1973 to 9.1% in 1976, reflecting the impact of the increase in
BNDE's nominal lending rate from 8% to 9% in 1972, and from 9% to 10% in 1975.
As a result, profits before taxes, and allocation to reserves and provisions,
increased by 70% in 1975 to reach DH 17.5 million, and increased further to
DH 23 million in 1976. Net profits have increased from DH 3.9 million in
1974 to DH 7.2 million in 1976. 1/
5.09      Net profit on average equity has dropped from 8.9% in 1975 to 6.9%
in 1976, owing to the doubling of the share capital which took place in 1975.
BNDE distributed DH 3.2 million from reserves in share dividends at the time
of the last capital increase; consequently the average yield on originally
subscribed BNDE shares exceeded the 8% paid in cash. The book value of
shares amounted to 157% of par value at end 1976.
Quality of Equity Portfolio
5.10      BNDE's total equity portfolio of DH 71.5 million at December 31,
1975, consisted of investments in 42 companies. Only 10 companies, which
accounted for 21% of total investments, were in financial difficulties; four
of these companies (DH 783,100 investment) are in liquidation. Provisions
amounting to DH 5.3 million are adequate to cover risk of loss in BNDE's
equity portfolio. BNDE's portfolio grew in 1976 to reach DH 84 million;
accordingly BNDE increased its provisions for losses to DH 6.6 million.
BNDE's provisions remained conservative, amounting to 7.8% of the equity
portfolio.
5.11      Dividend income and capital gains on BNDE's investments have increased
from DH 2.7 million in 1973 to reach DH 3.5 million in 1976, yielding 5.3% and
4.5% in those years respectively. These yields would have been higher were it
not for the addition of new, as yet unprofitable ventures.
Quality of Loan Portfolio
5.12      As of December 31, 1975, BNDE's portfolio comprised 63 medium-term 2/
and 180 long-term loans for a total of 243 loans outstanding, compared to 221
1/   Net profits do not reflect BNDE's true profitability as tax deductible
allocations (up to one-seventh of interest earned)to a special reserve,
as well as other deductions reduce taxable income, but not profits
(Annex 11).
2/   As currently defined by the Banque du Maroc, 5 years or less.



- 13 -
loans in 1974. Medium-term loans outstanding make up 17% of the total port-
folio outstanding at end 1975, compared to 16% in 1974. In 1975, loans amount-
ing to DH 477 million or 52% of total loan portfolio were guaranteed by the
Government through the Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG), compared to 38% in
1974. These guarantees and other banking consortium guarantees (e.g. for
leasing companies) are required by BNDE's Policy Statement in cases where
BNDE's financial exposure exceeds 15% of its unimpaired equity. The guar-
antees have been extensively reviewed and found to be satisfactory, and are
additional to normal securities taken by BNDE (such as mortgages).
5.13      As of December 31, 1975, total arrears of principal and interest in
excess of three months amounted to DH 44.6 million. Total portfolio outstand-
ing affected by arrears amounted to DH 110.5 million, i.e., 12.2% of total
portfolio outstanding at end 1975, compared to 9.3% in 1974. There has been
a small deterioration of the loan arrears situation; however, in the opinion
of the auditors provisions for losses 1/ of DH 12 million, as provided by BNDE
are adequate. BNDE's loan portfolio can be considered of reasonably sound
quality.
C. Audit
5.14      BNDE's financial statements are audited by Price Waterhouse & Co.,
an internationally reputed firm of public accountants. The quality of the
audit report, and supplementary information provided, are considered satis-
factory.
VI. SMALL SCALE INDUSTRY (SSI)
6.01      According to the 1969 industrial census, SSI in Morocco 2/ accounted
for 75% of total industrial employment and over 40% of industrial value added.
The Government is increasingly interested in developing this sector of industry,
which is of prime importance for employment creation, and has asked the Bank to
assist. A consultant's report, transmitted by the Bank to the Government in
November 1975, suggested three types of action (i) administrative, in order to
provide the small industry with the required legal and administrative frame-
work; (ii) technical, to improve the efficiency of SSI management, technology,
labor training, procurement and sales; and (iii) financial, to provide credit
and other financial services to the SSI. Because information on SSE is
sparse, the report also stressed the need to undertake a sector study.
6.02      The Bank's association with the Government to assist SSI is envi-
saged as a series of steps. The first one would consist of providing a rela-
tively small amount of financing ($5.0 million) under the proposed loan to
1/   Provisions for risk on individual direct loans are considered case by
case. Total provisions are deducted from the special reserve for loan
risk, the balance of which is considered part of the equity.
2/   Defined as enterprises employing between 10 and 50 workers, with annual
turnover under DH 7.5 million and total gross assets under DH 5.0 million.



- 14 -
enable BNDE to channel resources to SSI, and to be associated with a limited
SSI sector study to be undertaken in 1977. Based on the experience gained, a
larger SSI project could be developed in the future. The first steps, to be
taken under the BNDE loan, are described in Annex 15 and summarized below.
6.03      SSI component.  BNDE has acquired some experience in SSI under the
medium-term rediscountable procedure (para 2.06). Under the proposed $5
million pilot SSI scheme, BNDE will associate itself with the major commercial
bank in Morocco, Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), to provide funds to BCP ($3
million) to finance SSI projects which require medium-term loans. On its own,
BNDE will also provide long-term loans (over 5 years) to SSI projects which
otherwise would not have access to such funds. BNDE will also be prepared to
take equity participation in SSI which have not sufficient equity to become
eligible for commercial bank credits. In view of the current definition of
SSI in Morocco, the Bank would ask BNDE to focus its promotional effort on a
number of aspects, as outlined in paras 6.04-6.07.
6.04      Financing will be to selected, representative urban centers and
subsectors which have the larger concentration of SSI enterprises, and where
the growth potential is considered to be good. The target group should be one
where employment creation benefits primarily the urban poor. By setting maxi-
mum investment cost per job created of DH 25,000, the project seems likely to
meet the Bank's guidelines for the urban poor. To the extent possible, the
Bank, through BCP, will try to provide funds, in terms of equity participa-
tion and in longer-term financing, which are not otherwise available for SSI
entrepreneurs.
6.05      Extensive discussions took place in Morocco on the interest rate
to be charged to SSI enterprises for the financing envisaged under the pro-
posed pilot project. Medium-term loans (up to 7 years) to SSI are currently
made at an 8% p.a. interest rate. In comparison, long-term loans from BNDE
to medium and large industry are currently available at an effective interest
of 9% p.a.; when BNDE raises its interest rate (para 2.09), the effective
cost will be 10%. The interest rate differential between SSI loans and other
industrial loans seems reasonable, since the terms are different, and as there
is a promotion element in SSI financing. Even at an interest of 8%, the maxi-
mum investment cost per job of DH 25,000 prevents any risk of Bank funds
being used for capital intensive SSI projects. SSI loans at an effective
interest rate of 8% p.a. can, therefore, be supported. The authorities have
also argued that (i) the pilot project will only affect a segment of SSI
enterprises and within that segment only the borrowers of BCP/BNDE; if under
the proposed loan higher interest rates were required, an unbalanced situation
between BNDE/BCP borrowers and other borrowers would be created; (ii) the
Government first wants to study the outcome of the pilot project and sub-
sector study before taking any action on interest rates which would have
wide implications for industry.
6.06      To make Bank funds available to BCP and BNDE at an effective rate
consistent with the 8% rate to the end-user, it was therefore agreed that
the Government would offset BNDE's and BCP's higher administrative expenses
and special risks, and permit them to earn a very modest margin on these



- 15 -
operations. For this purpose, the Treasury will provide funds to reduce to
5% the cost of Bank funds for the BNDE/BCP portion of the component. BNDE
would then relend Bank funds to BCP at 6% p.a. This would leave BNDE with
a 1% and BCP with a 2% gross margin. The subsidy for direct BNDE loans will
be 2% p.a. There will be no subsidy for equity participations. In all cases,
the foreign exchange risk will be assumed, as in the past, by the Treasury, at
no cost to BNDE. Because this project is basically experimental and does not
imply an endorsement by the Bank of the Government interest rate policy, it
is proposed to accept the subsidy arrangement.
6.07      As also described in Annex 15, BNDE and BCP have agreed to organize
appraisal and supervision capabilities for the SSI scheme which would, for the
first time in Morocco, attempt to provide SSI entrepreneurs with assistance
especially with regards to technical aspects of SSI projects and technical
needs of SSI enterprises. In spite of its relatively small amount of finan-
cing, the SSI project component should provide some 1,500 jobs.
Sector Study
6.08      In the same subsectors and urban centers selected for the SSI loan
component, a study will be commissioned by BNDE in mid-1977 whose main objec-
tives will be:
(i)  to make an inventory of the characteristics, economic needs
and growth potential of SSI;
(ii)  to define SSI rationally; and
(iii)  to propose an action and implementation program of technical
assistance to SSI in three areas, (i) administration and
legal; (ii) technical (technological, training, marketing);
and (iii) financial (credit, guarantees, risk).
6.09      The study will be undertaken under the responsiblity of a qualified
consultant and is expected to include expatriate as well as Moroccan experts
(the latter from BNDE, BCP and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry). Draft
Terms of Reference have been agreed with BNDE, and are shown in the Attachment
to Annex 15. Monitoring of the study will be coordinated by BNDE and the
Bank. The foreign cost of the study is estimated at below $200,000, and the
study will be completed over a six-month period. BNDE has agreed to mobilize
from its own resources, and with BCP's contribution, at least $100,000. If
needed, the balance (not to exceed $100,000) will be financed from the pro-
posed loan (repayment over 12 years). Consultant selection is in progress;
the study report should be available in the spring of 1978.

VII. PROSPECTS
A. The Environment
7.01      The industrial prospects for 1977, the last year of the third
Five-Year Plan, and the early years of the 1978-82 Fourth Plan period are
favorable, not only because the Government appears to be determined to main-
tain a high level of industrial investment, but also because the sizeable
investment undertaken in 1975 and 1976 will have an impact on manufacturing
and industrial output in the years to come. No details of the next 1978-82
Development Plan are as yet available, nor will they be until the end of 1977.
A levelling off in the general level of investments is expected, as the
previous high growth rate cannot be maintained due to financial constraints.
Nevertheless, it is expected that the Government will continue its efforts to
promote development of industry in general and manufacturing in particular
and would: (i) maintain incentives to encourage industrial investments, (ii)
continue its efforts to develop large-scale basic industries, such as steel,
chemicals, and fertilizers, primarily by public investments, and (iii) increase
assistance and financing to the small-scale enterprise in order to increase
employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector.
B. Operations
7.02      Assumptions governing BNDE's Five-Year business and financial fore-
casts are detailed in Annex 16. In the absence of firm investment targets
in the 1978-82 Plan, but based on a pipeline of about 60 projects requiring
DH 1.4 billion in direct term loans, BNDE expects its business as measured by
volume of approvals to grow annually at a moderate (current) rate of 8% in
1978-81. For 1977 BNDE projects the same level of activities as in 1976,
based largely on the projects remaining to be implemented in the 1973-77 Plan
(Annex 17). The above assumptions appear valid based on BNDE's current
pipeline of project.
7.03      Total loan approvals would amount to DH 3.4 billion in 1977-80,
compared to DH 2.0 billion in 1973-76, a 70% increase; commitments would
amount to DH 2.8 billion in 1977-80, representing a 60% increase over the
period 1973-76. Equity investment approvals would total DH 55 million in
1977-80 compared to DH 42 million in 1973-76; in real terms this would
represent a levelling off in BNDE's equity investments.
C. Financial Prospects
Resource Requirements
7.04      BNDE's projected resource requirements through 1979, and the finan-
cing plan prepared by BNDE through mid-1979, are detailed in Annex 18 and
summarized below:

Accumulated Resource Gap        154    257        216       573           573
7.05      BNDE's resource mobilization strategy has been to diversify its
sources, and match term loan with appropriate borrowings. In this it has
generally been successful, and there is no reason to expect that BNDE will
deviate from this strategy in the future. During the last six months BNDE
has been aggressively seeking new, diversified resources. As a result, a
balanced plan as shown above has been arrived at. A firm resource mobiliza-
tion plan covering the second half of 1979 will not be prepared by BNDE until
early 1978. The funds of DH 203 million (US$45 million) becoming available
under the proposed Bank loan, most of which are expected to be committed by
mid-1979, would reduce the resource gap at that time from DH 216 million to
DH 13 million; pending preparation of BNDE's resource mobilization plan for
the period after mid-1979, the resource gap at the end of 1979 would be DH 370
million.
7.06      According to the BNDE resource mobilization plan through mid-1979,
floating rate (Euro-dollar) funds would be limited to one borrowing of DH 450
million in 1977. On the basis of a 9% average cost for new borrowings 1/,
excluding Bank and local funds, BNDE's overall profitability would remain
adequate even if LIBOR 2/ indexed Euro-dollar funds could go temporarily
higher, up to an average of, say, 12% per year. Any long-lasting period
of high LIBOR rates would indicate a general world-wide increase in the
level of interest rates; such an increase could be expected to be followed
by increases in BNDE and other bank lending rates in Morocco.
1/   Actual Euro-dollar cost to BNDE would have been about 7-1/2% in
March 1977.
2/   London Inter-Bank Offered Rate.



- 18 -
Financial Position
7.07      BNDE's projected income statements, cash flow, and balance sheets
are shown in Annexes 19, 20 and 21. As shown in Annex 20, BNDE's assets are
expected to more than double during 1977-81, mainly on account of the increase
in the net equity and loan portfolio which would grow by DH 1.7 billion, an
increase of 120%. The projected financial position would be generally good.
IBRD debts outstanding would decrease substantially from 25% in 1975 to 10% of
total debt outstanding in 1981. Euro-dollar debt would decline from 37% at
end 1977 to 7% of total debts outstanding in 1981 (assuming no further Euro-
dollar borrowings by BNDE after 1977). The projected term debt/equity ratio
would remain below 10:1, and would improve as sizeable reserves (after
deducting adequate provisionq for real risks of loss on loans) are built
up, primarily through the special reserve for loan risks. The debt service
ratio, as indicated in BNDE'6 projections, will be 0.8:1 in 1977, and fluc-
tuate between 1.1:1 and 1.5:1 in the period 1978-1981. Interest coverage
will range between 1.3 and 1.4 during this period (Annex 19).
Profitability Prospects
7.08      BNDE's profitability prospects are expected to remain good, assum-
ing an average 9% p.a. coOt for LIBOR index"d Enro-dollar and other foreign
funds other than Bank funds, and an 11% p.a. BNDE interest rate on long-term
loans. Profits before taxes and allocation to reserves and provisions would
quadruple, increasing from DH 23.0 million in 1975 to DH 89 million in 1981.
Although BNDE's average interest spread would decrease from 2.5% in 1976 to
2.2% in 1977 owing to the projected rising trend in cost of borrowed funds,
the greater volume of business, coupled with relatively low levels of adminis-
trative costs (which would be below 0.6% of average assets), would contribute
to the increased profitability; from 1978 onwards the interest spread starts a
climbing trend from 2.4% to 2.8% as the effect of the 11% interest rate on new
loans is felt. Net profits would experience a dip in 1976-78 principally due
to relatively higher tax-exempt allocations to the special reserve for loan
risks. While profit before taxes and allocations to reserves and provisions
grow steadily, from 23.31 of average BNDE equity in 1975 to 28% in 1981, net
profits decrease from 6.9% of equity in 1976 to 5.5% in 1978, due in part to
the doubling of the share capital that year; from 1979 onwards net profits
would grow slowly to reach 10.3% of average equity in 1981. BNDE would have
no problem in maintaining an 8% dividend rate after doubling its share capital.
The dividend rate could even be increased to 9-10%, provided that the alloca-
tion to the special reserve be limited to about one-tenth of interest income.
VIII. THE LOAN - OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The industrial sector of the Moroccan economy has expanded rapidly
since the last Bank loan to BNDE was granted, and there has been a continuing
shift towards larger project entities, often in the public sector. BNDE's
operations have reflected the general upsurge in industrial activity, and BNDE
has continued to be the major institution for appraising and financing indus-
trial projects, both in the private and in the public sector. The main
justifications for the Bank's eighth loan to BNDE are summarized below.



- 19 -
8.02      Provision of Resources.  Although BNDE has attracted a substantial
amount of alternative resources, the expected expansion of BNDE's operations
will result in a need for additional long-term funds. The proposed Bank loan
would provide 10% of the additional resources required by BNDE during 1977 to
mid-1979. The confidence expressed by the Bank by continued lending to BNDE
should also facilitate the mobilization of other foreign resources by BNDE.
8.03      Institutional Development.  The Bank's assistance, whether through
the conditions included in the Loan Agreements, field and subproject supervi-
sion, sharing of information, or formal instruction courses, has greatly bene-
fited BNDE. Further assistance is requested by BNDE, and is justified in
view of the increased levels of industrial investments in the country and the
necessity to adjust BNDE's operations and procedures correspondingly. The
conditions of the loan would provide the Bank an opportunity to monitor BNDE's
appraisal techniques, and to guide BNDE in developing an effective system for
encouraging and developing SSI.
8.04      Support for the Industrial Sector.  Although the Government's in-
vestment program and strategy will not be known in detail until the end of
1977, when the new Five-Year Plan is adopted, it is believed to stress con-
tinued emphasis on industrial development. In the meantime a substantial
number of industrial projects have already been identified by BNDE, both
in the private and public sector. BNDE's assistance in the formulation,
evaluation, and financing of such industrial sector projects is of crucial
importance. (BNDE has been entrusted by the Government to evaluate and advise
on all industrial loans requiring term financing under the provisions of the
Industrial Code.)
8.05      Small-Scale Industry.  The Government is placing emphasis on the
expansion of industrial employment for the urban poor by strengthening its
assistance to labor intensive small-scale industries (SSI). Assistance to
such SSI, which create employment at relatively low cost, is also in line
with the Bank's general policy in respect to the urban poor, who would be the
main beneficiaries of the increased employment thus created. As BNDE has
expressed interest in assisting in the development of an SSI pilot project,
and can provide expertise and organizational strength, an SSI loan component
has been included in the eighth loan.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      BNDE continues to remain a suitable recipient for Bank loans.  A
Bank loan of $45 million, as proposed, would provide about 10% of BNDE's
resource requirements during 1977-mid-1979. Of the Bank loan, up to $5 million
would be allocated to an SSI pilot project.
9.02      The proposed loan should be made on the normal terms and conditions
as have been applied to recent loans to development finance companies, includ-
ing the commitment charge; the proposed loan would have a flexible amortiza-
tion schedule, with subloans not to exceed 15 years, including three years of
grace.



- 20 -
9.03      To ensure a sound debt/equity structure, the capital of BNDE will
be doubled, and the total term debt will not exceed ten times BNDE's equity.
The interest rate on long-term loans charged by BNDE to sub-borrowers will be
raised from 10% to 11%. BNDE will consult with the Bank on any possible sub-
stantial changes in the resource mobilization plan shown in this report.
BNDE will maintain an adequate debt service coverage.
9.04      The free limit will be raised to $2 million, with no aggregate
free limit. The maximum of any credit granted to a single project by BNDE
from the proposed Bank loan will be limited to $4 million, and the total
exposure (including commitments) with Bank funds shall not exceed $6 million.
BNDE will not normally consider financing of large-scale projects brought
to its attention after the engineering contract has been completed, or the
construction contract has been signed. BNDE will calculate the economic
rate of return, when feasible, on all Bank-financed sub-projects, and for
all other projects receiving BNDE loans above DH 5 million. Bank funds will
not be used for the purchase of fishing vessels.
9.05      BNDE will execute an SSI pilot scheme, partly in cooperation with
a commercial Bank (BCP), and will provide supervisory manpower. BNDE will
also supervise and finance a SSI sector study. The staff of BNDE will be
expanded to at least 68 professionals, including an addition of three
engineers.

MOROCCO
BNDE - SMALL SCALE INDUSTRY COMPONENT
A. Current Situation
1.        SSI accounted for 75% of total industrial employment and over 40% of
industrial value added according to the 1969 industrial census. Mlore recent
statistical information is not available on a national scale, but an indica-
tion of the growing importance of SSI, and of their distribution by subsector,
is provided by a 1975 survey of industrial activities. The importance of SSI
in the context of Morocco's industrial development is beginning to be recog-
nized, not only because of their employment creation potential, but also
because they are called upon to play an essential role in complementing the
industrial activities undertaken by the larger plants.
2         A generally valid and accepted definition of SSI has not yet been
established in Morocco, but the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Central
Bank and the banking sector in general, have agreed on five criteria for SSI:
(i) employment of at least 10, but normally less than 50 persons;
(ii)  investment per job exceeds DH 5,000 (no upper ceiling);
(iii) investment of at least DH 100,000 in production equipment;
(iv) annual turnover not exceeding DH 7.5 million (was DH 3.0
million up to 1/1/77); and
(v)  total gross assets not exceeding DH 5.0 million (was DH 2.0
million up to 1/1/77).
Credit is limited to DH 1 million per project. The above definitions seem to
exceed somewhat the definitions tentatively recognized as applying to SSI in
the Bank. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this pilot project, the Moroccan
definitions are being accepted, however with an upper ceiling on the invest-
ment cost of DH 25,000 per job in order to focus on employment.
3.        In spite of emerging industrial regionalization, Casablanca remains
the country's economic heart and its industry largely dominates that of the
other regions. Casablanca's industrial sector comprises 1,775 registered
individual enterprises employing more than 5 people. Its sectorial distribu-
tion among the major manufacturing sectors is as follows: 1/

As shown in the table, almost half of the enterprises belong to the handicraft
sector (they provide less than 10 jobs each), 38% are SSIs.  The remaining 15%
account for medium- or large-scale units employing more than 50 persons.  The
most important industries in the SSI range are textiles, metal products, food,
wood products and leather.
4.        The distribution of SSIs in other major urban centers is similar to
that found in Casablanca. The SSI's role may be even stronger than suggested
by the available figures, because they deal with registered enterprises only
and are not always accurate 1/.
Promotion
5.        Promotional activities are still at a very early stage.  The govern-
ment is only beginning to address its assistance to SSI, and institutions lack
competent personnel. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is responsible for
SSI promotion, but due to the lack of staff, the support to SSI by the Min-
istry's four technical divisions has been rather limited so far. ODI is the
Government office for industrial promotion to stimulate investment through
studies and participation. Until now, ODI has focussed its activities on
medium, or, even more so, on large industries. At present, there are no
specific action programs to promote SSI within ODI. Since the distinction
between handicrafts and SSI is not sharp, it can be said that the two handi-
craft institutions: the "Direction de l'Artisanat" and the "Entraide Nationale",
provide some assistance to SSIs: there are ambitious programs in technical and
marketing support, as well as in manpower training. The direct benefit for SSI
itself, however, is generally regarded as negligible. Reasons for this are the
lack of a well defined program, staff, financial resources, and of clearly
identified action procedures.
1/   Real employment figures, for instance, seem to be higher than those
shown. This means that a large number of enterprises counted as
handicrafts should be among SSI.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
Financing
6.        A coherent system has been operating since 1973 (although many SSIs
seem to be still unaware of its possibilities), following the creation of an
accelerated procedure for medium-term credit rediscountable to the Central
Bank. It applies specifically to SSIs, as defined in para. 2. Maximum
credit is DH 1,000,000 and 30% equity financing is required. Each credit
proposal is to be approved by a Restricted Committee formed by BNDE, the
Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank, and the rediscounting request is
automatically processed by the Central Bank after approval by the committee.
The Central Bank requires commercial banks to allocate 4.5% of their deposits
to such medium term credits. These credits, for durations between 2 and 5
years, are to finance productive equipment of the enterprises in the indus-
trial, commercial and transport sectors. Procedures have been simplified and
streamlined considerably. The appraisal of the projects is initiated by the
commercial banks, following a standard procedure prepared by BNDE.
7.        Total SSI credits granted jumped for DH 5.6 million in 1973 to
DH 27.5 million in 1976. BNDE and the commercial banks feel that a tangible
promotion effort could raise these amounts sharply, although the condition that
about 30% of the project cost be financed by the investor itself seems to be
an obstacle for many SSI. Government and banking sources believe, and
this seems to be confirmed by available statistics on investments, that only
between 10 and 20% of SSI's investments have been financed through the
Restricted Committee. The main explanation for this situation is the impor-
tance of short-term rollover credit extended by commercial banks to finance
SSI investments, estimated to have financed more than 50% of total SSI invest-
ments during the last years.
8.        Casablanca alone has taken almost 40% of total credits granted by
the Restricted Committee followed by Fes (10%). The two leading industrial
activities financed have been food products and textiles. BCP has been the
most active bank, financing alone 45% of the total credits granted through
the Committee since 1973.
9.        Non-rediscountable medium-term credits do not appear to be a major
source of SSI financing. The commercial banks, with the only probable excep-
tion of BCP, have preferred to limit their role to the use of rediscounting
facilities. BNDE's long-term credit lending to SSIs has been negligible.
Leasing, which presented some interest to SSIs when it appeared in Morocco in
the early '60s, has been of decreasing importance for SSIs, probably due to
high interest charges on leasing operations. Equipment credits for durations
of between 12 and 24 months can be provided for the purchase of equipment,
mostly by BCP; most of them go to the enterprises in public works, and few SSIs
seem to have made use of them. BCP was recently granted the possibility to act
as the rediscounting institution to finance investments below DH 1.5 million
for enterprises in the fishing sector.

10.       The role of BNDE.  BNDE has not been active in direct SSI financing.
Its role, however, has been extremely important at the level of the Restricted
Committee: BNDE is responsible for checking out the commercial banks' evalua-
tion of the credit proposals, approving or rejecting it, and setting up con-
ditions or guarantees for financing. BNDE's appraisal capabilities - far
better than those of the commercial banks - and its experience in project
financing, make it the crucial institution in the overall scheme. Further-
more, BNDE's Casablanca office has been trying to play a promotional role for
SSIs, with limited success, mainly because of the lack of staff. Some work
has, nevertheless, been done by identifying some projects.  BNDE's experience
in Morocco's main industrial sectors could be helpful for identifying addi-
tional suitable SSI projects in the future.
11.       Banque Centale Populaire (BCP).  BCP is the most active institution
in the financing of SSI in Morocco; it is the only commercial banking institu-
tion in Morocco specifically promoting SSI development. In addition to the
traditional banking activities, BCP plays a considerable role in activities
like maritime credit, agricultural credit, handicrafts credit, equipment
credit, and medium-term credit through the Restricted Committee. It also has a
special convention with CIH to finance low-cost housing, and has been charged
by the Government to manage the Fund for Moroccanization, and the granting of
credits for that specific purpose.
12.       A fully government owned bank, BCP has varied resources - deposits
from clients and regional popular banks, government grants and advances, local
bond issues, rediscounting facilities at the Central Bank - in addition to
its equity. BCP's Board, under the chairmanship of the Finance Minister, is
composed of one representative of each of the Ministries of Finance, Industry
and Commerce, and Interior, one each for the Central Bank, BNDE, Caisse de
Depot et de Gestion, CIH, one representative form the Ministry responsible for
handicrafts, two from the boards of the BRPs, and one each of the professional,
industrial and commercial organizations, and of the professional handicraft
organizations.
13.       The Regional popular banks (BRPs) are savings and loans coopera-
tives created by BCP. Each BRP has territorial boundaries and it enjoys
autonomy of management within defined limits of responsibility. There are 8
BRPs today and a decentralization program to extend it to 20 by upgrading some
agencies is underway. BCP coordinates BRPs financial and promotional policies,
acts as clearing house for BRPs, and finances certain activities through equity
investments, credits and rediscounting facilities.
14.       The BRPs act as primary banks, in direct contact with the clients.
They carry out the evaluation for a given credit operation and decide on
granting a loan, if the amount proposed for medium-term credit is below DH
150,000 (if short-term: DH 500,000). 1/ Overall, about 25% of BCP's credit
1/   These limits are valid for Casablanca's BRP; other have smaller limits.



ANNEX 15
Page 5
decisions - in amounts - is made by BRPs within the framework of their
prerogatives. In numbers, the proportion is about the opposite. Credit
approvals by BRPs for industrial SSIs are projected by BCP at DH 45 million
in 1976, DH 74 million in 1977 and DH 105 million in 1978 (compared with
approvals of DH 18 million in 1975).
15.       Appraisals carried out by BRPs focus almost exclusively on financial
aspects.  They rarely question the technical and marketing aspects, except to
define the basic parameters chosen for the study without analytically trying
to justify them. For projects submitted to the Restrictive Committee by BCP,
a more in depth appraisal is carried out by BCP. However, only BNDE can -
and does - scrutinize the technical and marketing aspects of the proposals
it receives.
B. Action Required
16.       Observations on SSI's characteristics and problems have been derived
from discussions with the Ministries of Industry, Labor and Finance, the Plan
Secretariat, the Handicraft Directorate, the "Entraide Nationale", BNDE, the
commercial banks, the Central Bank, the "Office de la Formation Professionelle",
the ODI, and the economic departments within Casablanca's and Rabat's prefec-
tures. The information obtained revealed that six major problems affect SSI
in Morocco:
(a)  Lack of financial means (self-financing, equity funds,
collateral to meet credit regulations);
(b)  Lack of information and of ability and experience in
dealing with the Government and/or banking institutions;
(c)  Lack of skilled labor (worker, foreman, supervisor
level);
(d)  Lack of technical know-how (production, raw materials,
quality control, workshop organization, inventory
control);
(e)  Lack of adequate equipment (machines, tools, measuring
and testing instruments).
These deficiencies appear with various degrees according to the sectors. How-
ever, lack of training and technical know-how is a common problem because many
SSI entrepreneurs in all sectors are former merchants and often lack the basic
background to tackle economic and financial problems.



ANNEX 15
Page 6
C. The Bank's Role
17.       The Government asked the Bank in 1974 to review the situation of SSI
and propose a plan of action. A consultant's report, transmitted by the Bank
to the Government in November 1975, confirmed the numerical importance of SSI
in Morocco and suggested three types of action: (i) administrative, in order
to provide the small industry with the required legal and administrative frame-
work; (ii) technical, to improve the economic role and efficiency of small
industrialists as far as management, technology, labor training, procurement
and sales were concerned; and (iii) financial, to provide credit, guarantees
and financial mechanisms geared to the SSI needs. The report stressed the
need to undertake as early as possible a sector study of SSI, in particular
to overcome the lack of reliable data, and to give a basis for defining SSI
as opposed to large and medium-sized industry on one hand, and handicraft on
the other hand.
18.       In discussions between the Government and the Bank in 1976, it was
concluded that assistance from the Bank was particularly welcome, in spite
of the absence of sufficient expertise on SSI matters on both sides. It was
agreed that, initially, the Bank would:
(a)  provide, in the context of the proposed loan to BNDE, a rela-
tively small amount of foreign exchange to enable BNDE to
channel resources to a limited number of select SSI. It was
understood that this component would be treated as a pilot
project where all parties involved would focus on the learning
experience to be drawn from concrete SSI investments;
(b)  extend technical and, if necessary, financial assistance to
a limited sector study to be undertaken in 1977, which would
provide the basis required for planning a more comprehensive
project; the terms of reference agreed with BNDE are attached
to this Annex.
19.       It is hoped that the two steps above, though modest, should be
sufficient to provide the quantitative information and qualitative judgement
required to better assess the economic role, the specific needs and the
prospects of SSI in Morocco. In light of this information, the Bank may
decide to expand its technical and financial support in later years in the
form of a project geared exclusively and country-wide to SSI.
D. Proposed SSI Pilot Project
20.       Under the proposed loan to BNDE, it is recommended that a component
of up to $5 million be earmarked to finance SSI. Since the use of this com-
ponent has essentially the character of an experiment, financing will be made
available to SSI in a limited number of selected, representative urban centers



ANNEX 15
Page 7
and subsectors, which have already established SSI in this field, and where
the growth potential is considered to be good. The urban centers would be
Casablanca, Fes and Marrakesh, and the subsectors would be mechanical and
electrical manufacturing, textile and leather, and food products.
21.       Under these definitions and based on a conservative estimate of
potential financial needs of small enterprises, a line of credit to BNDE of
up to $5 million would tentatively be allocated as follows:
(a) $300,000 for BNDE to take equity participations in SSI,
a large part of which would have been promoted by BNDE.
(b) $3 million to finance the import component (estimated at 65%
of total investment) of medium-term credits granted by BCP to
small industry. These credits would thus be refinanced by
BNDE (loans of 3-5 years, risk with BCP).
(c) $1.7 million to finance the import component of small-scale
industrial projects financed directly by BNDE (loans above
5 years, risk with BNDE).
22.       Due to the relative lack of experience of BNDE in SSI projects and
the need for BCP to establish new working relationships with BNDE and through
BNDE with the Bank, the above amounts are notional ones which all parties
would be prepared to review one year after the proposed loan has become
effective.
23.       To administer and monitor this SSI loan component, the Loan Agree-
ment with the Bank provides for specific covenants in this respect. The
wording and contents of a convention between BNDE and BCP, to ensure project
cohesion, has been agreed with BNDE during negotiations, and is being reviewed
by BCP. The signing of this convention is a condition of disbursement of the
SSI component of the loan. As proposed, BNDE will be the Bank's borrower for
the entire component. BNDE will, in turn relend to BCP for specific sub-
projects. As the borrower under the proposed loan, BNDE will be responsible
to supervise BCP appraisal and SSI supervision work. Under the convention
between BNDE and BCP, BCP will provide BNDE with an unconditional guarantee of
repayment.  Covenants under the Loan Agreement for the proposed component will
provide clarification on (i) commitment and disbursement procedures (see para
27-31 below), (ii) definition of eligible SSI projects with criteria, as
detailed above in para 2, and with investment loans limited to DH 1 million
and representing not more than 60% of the total investment cost of the project,
which is the estimated average foreign exchange component of SSI projects,
(iii) required Government subsidies (see main report, para 6.06), and (iv)
organization and manpower allocation.
24.       Under the limited objectives of the SSI component of the BNDE loan,
it is proposed to defer concerted action on these problems until more knowledge
on SSI has become available. The Bank's funding, as far as possible, will be
specifically aimed at those potential and existing SSI entrepreneurs who have



ANNEX 15
Page 8
no access to SSI funds, for example through lack of own equity, or because
they require longer-term funds than presently available in Morocco. Bank
funds will be additional to present SSI program, and not be a substitution
for funds provided by others. In the process BNDE and BCP would provide
sub-borrowers with technical assistance and services from its financial
analysts and engineers.
E. Organization
25.       The responsibility in BNDE for SSI projects will be given to the
Medium Term Credit Division in BNDE's Projects Department, which since 1972
has been responsible for all rediscountable medium-term credits. This divi-
sion will also be responsible for relationships with BCP under the pilot
project. This division has an experienced chief, and at present two econo-
mists; it has also access to technical support from BNDE engineers. In view
of the new demand placed on this division under the pilot project, BNDE has
agreed to assign an additional full-time financial economist. This ii con-
sidered adequate, at least at the beginning when the number of SSI subprojects
would be small; the staff would be increased as necessary.
26.       A special effort will have to be made to ensure adequate supervision
of SSI subprojects under the scheme. While BNDE's staff of the medium-term
credit division could supervise managerial, financial, and marketing matters,
it would need the support of engineers to supervise technical aspects of SSI
projects and technical needs of SSI enterprises. To ensure adequate supervi-
sion of SSI enterprises under the SSI scheme, BNDE has agreed to supervise
the bulk of BCP/BNDE financed projects twice a year. These supervisions
will be organized sub-sector by sub-sector, and supervision reports will not
only focus on individual SSI projects but also on the sub-sector prospects as
a whole, including an analysis concerning the technical, marketing, management
and economic aspects.
Fe Procedure for Commitments and Disbursements of the
SSI Component of the Bank Loan
27.       Under the proposed component, which must be flexible to be practical,
BNDE would have access to Bank funds under a simplified procedure.  BNDE will
assure itself that purchases under its SSI subloans (either direct BNDE sub-
loans or BCP subloans) are made for the capital goods which have been specified
in its (or BCP's) subloan agreements.
28.       To draw Bank funds, BNDE will provide the Bank with a bi-monthly
statement showing the following information:



ANNEX 15
Page 9
-    name of investor;
-    subsector;
-    city;
-    summary list of purchases;
-    amount of total investment in project;
-    amount of BNDE subloan, terms and conditions.
29.       On that basis, BNDE will ask the Bank to reimburse its subloan
provided that the subloan is not more than 65% of total investment cost (i.e.
less than the estimated average foreign exchange cost of SSI projects), and
that the project falls under the definition of size, subsector and city
defined for this pilot project.
30.       This simplified request should be sufficient for BNDE to draw Bank
funds. However, to enable the Bank to be informed about the specific nature
and characteristics of SSI subloans, BNDE will attach to its request a copy
of the Restrictive Committee form which provides extensive information on the
investments and the enterprises.
31.       BNDE should also agree to supervise all SSI subloans at least once
a year, and for those which have received Bank financing in excess of $100,000
at least twice a year. Based on these supervision visits, BNDE will prepare
a supervision report providing an assessment of the general status of the
project as regards its financial, technical, marketing, management and develop-
ment aspects, with particular focus on the needs of such SSI enterprises to
optimize their activity and the role BNDE (and BCP) have or should have played
to maximize their assistance; a copy of this report will be forwarded to the
Bank.

annual turnover      -   less than DH 7.5 million
employment           -   between 10 and 50
Reporting Requirements
4.        BNDE and the World Bank are joining in sponsoring, monitoring and
requesting this study. Administrative arrangement with the foreign consul-
tants will be detailed in a contract. The consultant would be responsible
to submit a draft of his report to BNDE and IBRD for comments, and the final
report should be delivered in five copies. In addition, the consultant will
send on the first of each month a brief report on its work to BNDE and IBRD.
Outline of Work
5.        The consultant report should cover in depth the following points:
I.   Definition of SSI in the given sectors
From its investigation, the consultant should indicate, to
the extent possible, what an appropriate definition of SSI
in Morocco should be (as opposed to handicraft or medium-
and large-scale industry).

II.   Sectoral Survey
A.   Data Gathering
The consultant should provide comprehensive information,
statistics and classification of SSI in the sub-sectors
and urban centers considered in order to provide a
meaningful inventory of the main characteristics of this
segment of the economy. For example, he should quantify
the following aspects:
a.   Number and types of enterprises (location, age, size,
stage of development, etc.).
b.   Information on the enterprise activities (output and
services), ownership, sales, market, investment, etc.
C.   On a large selected sample, information on past
operations (last three years), current situation
and prospects over the next two or three years.
B.   Assessment of current and prospective situation
a.   Based on field investigations and other means, the
consultant should analyze in detail the major issues
(financial, marketing (including exports), labor,
productive equipment, raw material, information
systems, promotion, etc.) which may affect SSI
operations and development.
b.   The consultant should provide a detailed description
of the needs of SSI enterprises in their current and
prospective operations and analyze how such needs
are currently met (by the financial community, the
Government or others) and to what extent some of
these needs are not met.
C.   Recommendations
First, the consultant should make an assessment of the com-
parative economic role of SSI in the Moroccan economy and
industry and its potential importance in this respect.
Secondly, the consultant should establish priorities to
the various types of assistance SSI need in Morocco to
optimize its development in the economy.
Thirdly, the consultant should design a comprehensive program
,of policies to be instigated and actions to be taken by the
authorities and others to develop technical and financial
assistance, and administrative support as required,to cata-
lyze SSI development. The cost of this program and its
schedule of implementation should be specified.

MOROCCO
BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE
Major Assumptions for BNDE's
Five-Year Operational and Financial Forecasts
A.   Operational Forecasts
1.   Loan and equity investment approvals are partly based on a pipeline
of projects submitted to BNDE for financing or expected to be so in
the near future; direct BNDE loan financing is estimated at DH 1,840
million for these projects. Approvals are projected to grow at an
annual current growth rate of 8% p.a. from 1978 onwards. For 1977
approvals are expected to remain at slightly the same level as 1976.
Although the launching of the next Five-Year Plan (1978-82) could
change the picture, it is assumed that the effects would not be
felt before 1979-81, and even then would not substantially change
the volume of business projected for those years due to the long
gestation period of major new industrial projects.
2.   Commitments and disbursements are based on a case-by-case study of
the status and estimated implementation schedule of projects in the
pipeline, and on past trends in BNDE's activities. On the average
BNPE's loans are disbursed in 21 months (i.e. between 18 and 24
months).
3.   Loan repayments are assumed to be over an average period of 9 years,
including an average grace period of 1.5 years, and with level prin-
cipal payments.
B.   Financial Forecasts
1.   Income Statements
(a) Interests on direct loans are calculated on the average loans
outstanding at the beginning and end of each year; BNDE's loans
outstanding bear interest rates of 7%, 8%, 9% and 10% p.a. for
commitments through June 30, 1977. Thereafter an interest rate
of 11% p.a. is applied on new long-term loan commitments. The
latter are assumed to account for 80% of new commitments based
on a study of the composition of the pipeline of projects.
Long-term loans are defined as those exceeding 7 years.
(b) Revenue on rediscounted loans is assumed to increase annually
by DH 500,000.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
(c)  Commissions on loans are assumed to increase annually by DH 500,000.
(d)  Dividend revenue is based on an assumed average annual yield of 5%
on investments disbursed and outstanding.
(e)  Other income from rent, deposits and miscellaneous is assumed to
increase annually by DH 10,000.
(f)  Charges on borrowings are calculated as above in (a).  Charges on
borrowings outstanding are detailed in Annex 10. For new borrow-
ings the following charges are assumed:
-  IBRD                        8.5%
-  Euro-dollars                9.0%
- Arab Funds and Kuwait IV   9.0%
-  Local bonds                 7.5%
-  Spanish                     9.0%
(g)  Commissions and fees are based on the expected terms of new
borrowings and the expec:ted period of their disbursement. 1/
(h)  Personnel Cost and Salaries will increase by 28% in 1977, in view
of a general salary raise and additional recruitments; thereafter
an annual increase of 10% is assumed.
(i)  Other Administrative Expenses are also to grow annually by 10%.
(j)  Amortization and Depreciations follow Moroccan fiscal practices.
(k)  Provisions and Allocations to Reserves
(i) For provision for depreciation of investment portfolio an
annual allocation of DH 600,000 is assumed based on past
trends and taking account of portfolio build-up.
(ii) For the Special Reserve for Loan Risks, an annual alloca-
tion equivalent to one nineth of interest income is
assumed. This reserve may be available wholly or in part
for distribution, provided back tax deductions are repaid
entirely.
(iii)  For the reserves for rediscounted loans an annual alloca-
tion of DH 200,000 is assumed. The annual allocation is
limited by law to 0.15% of new commitments and the total
reserve to 0.50% of amounts outstanding at end of year.
1/   Commissions and fees on bond issues, which are important, are
capitalized and amortized over fifteen years by BNDE.



ANNEX 16
Page 3
(iv)  The Provisions for risks on direct loans are calculated as
follows: assuming that total provisions for risks on loans
and equity investments should be maintained at 1.2% of the
total BNDE investment portfolio, provisions for risks on
direct loans are determined by difference.
(1) Income Taxes are calculated based on the following rates applied to
taxable income:
Up to DH 500,000                40%
DH 500,001 to DH 2,00,000       44%
Over DH 2,000,000               48%
The following deductions from taxable income are allowed for BNDE
and assumed to continue:
(i)  annual allocation to the special reserves for direct loan
risks (up to a maximum one-seventh of interest earned on
direct loans)
(ii) annual allocations to reserve for risks on rediscounted loans
(iii)  dividend revenue on specially favored investments such as
holding companies, etc.
(m)  For the Investment Reserve, allocations are made on the basis of
the following rates applicable to taxable income:
Up to DH 50,000                 0%
DH 50,001 to DH 150,000         5%
Over DH 150,000                 8%
A portion of the annual allocation (80%) must be invested in the
purchase of Government (10 year-5%) equipment bonds. This reserve
is not available for distribution.
(n) Legal Reserves are built-up annually by 5% of net profits.
(o) For Dividends an 8% rate is maintained. The share capital increase
of DH 70 million would be implemented as follows:
(i)  DH 35 million paid-in September 30, 1977 and remunerated
starting October 30, 1977
(ii)  DH 35 million paid-in June 30, 1978 and remunerated
starting July 1978
NOTE:  In view of the small amount of the SSI component, the financial
implications on BNDE's operations have not been separately taken
into account.
