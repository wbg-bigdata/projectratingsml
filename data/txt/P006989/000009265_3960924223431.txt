PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
SECOND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(LOAN 1784-DO)
PREFAICE
1.        The following is a Project Completion Report on the Second Roa4
Maintenance and Reconstruction Project in the Dominican Republic financed
under Loan 1784-DO for US$35.0 million. Loan 1784-DO was approved on December
18, i979, and the project was carried out from 1980 to 1985.  The closing date
was June 30, 1985. The loan was fully disbursed, with the final disbursement
made in July 1986.
2.        This report was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Division,
Country Department III, of Latin America and the Caribbean Regional O-'ice.
It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, information
gleaned from the project files, and materials obtained during a project
completion mission.
3.        This completion report is more than four years overdue.  In
accordance with Bank Guidelines, therefore, its scope has been limited to a
critical review of the information at hand, and it has not been submitted to
the Borrower for comment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
SECOND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(LOAN 1784-DO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
i.        The project's overall goal was to build on the achievements of the
US$5.0 million First Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan 1316T-
DO). To this end, the project had five objectives: (1) the strengthening and
expansion of maintenance capacity undertaken under the £irst project; (2)
initiation of a high priority road reconstruction program for primary and
secondary roads with obsolete pavements; (3) a demonstration of labor-based
techniques for the improvement and maintenance of rural access roads; (4) use
of functional skill training to upgrade maintenance personnel in the
Secretariat of Public Works and Communications (SEOPC); and (5) a buildup of
SEOPC's,gapacity to plan and program road reconstruction works through the
establishment of a special unit entrusted with that work (para. 5).
implementation Experience '
ii.       The road reconstruction component ran into problems almost
immediately. Original project designs by local consultants turned out to be
inadequate, requiring contract revision and renegotiation at a cost increase
of nearly US$4.0 million (para. 14). Implementation suffered from poor
organization, SEOPC's inadequate managerial skills, contractors' lack of
equipment and constraints in counterpart funds. Poor financial practices in
SEOPC slowed budgeting and accounting (para. 15). In 1983, shortfalls in the
Emergency Road Reconstruction Project (Loan 1783-DO) prompted the Bank to
approve the use of funds from Loan 1784-DO to cover the shortfall. These
early problems were then compounded by unforeseen cost increases brought by
the economic crisis of 1983 and 1984. At project closing, none of the
segments selected for reconstruction was complete; all had to be carried over
into the Third Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan 2609-DO,
approved in August 1985), where ti&ay were subsequently finished (paras. 16-
17).
iii.      The maintenance and training program succeeded in its more limited
objectives but fell short of its more ambitious goals. By early 1981, all
maintenance and training equipment had been procured and put in operation and
a technical assistance program completed. Specific targets proved elusive,
however: the total active fleet stood at only 32.5?, lower than appraisal
forecasts, largely because of delays in buying spare parts and fuels (para.
20). This loan was also to support the nationwide introduction of an annual
maintenance programming system, but did not succeed, since staff departures in
search of higher salaries continually depleted institutioral memory. Training
of maintenance staff suffered from the turnover, as well as from lack of
equipment, inefficient use of the Road Training Production Unit and delays in



- iii -
paying per diems. Attempts to improve maintenance operations were obstructed
by turf battles between the maintenance and equipment units. A reorganization
helped resolve this problem, but by project closing, training had fallen so
far behind it was left to be completed under Loan 2609-DO (para. 21).
iv.       The Pilot Rural Roads Proaram was beset from the start by delays and
by the Borrower's persistent failure to provide sufficient local funds.
Consequently, the program dragged well beyond its planned two years and never
produced conclusive results on the issue it was designed to resolve: the
cost-effectiveness of labor-intensive road building techniques (paras. 22-23).
Results
v.        Road Reconstruction.  The higher costs occasioned by the need for
corrected designs and renegotiated contracts resulted in a lower rate of
return for the road projects than had been foreseen: 15Z rather than the 232
estimated at appraisal. The sensitivity analysis shows that the ERR, even
under adverse assumptions, reaches an overall value of nearly 122 (para. 24).
vi.       Road Maintenance Program.  Financial expenses were RD$104 million
for the 1981-85 period (in constant 1979 prices). The economic analysis
yields an ERR of 271. compared with appraisal forecasts of more than 1002 ERR.
The lower returns arose from delays in acquiring maintenance equipment,
targeting maintenance programs to emergency tasks rather than to preventive
treatment, deterioration of maintenance equipment used for reconstruction, and
delays in supply of maintenance materials arising from SEOPC's cumbersome
procedures (para. 26).
vii.      Pilot Rural Roads Program.  Only about half the forecast road
segments were completed and the program never generated enough information to
determine if labor-intensive techniques were more socially cost-effective.
The financial costs of construction were shown to be higher because of the
extra use of labor. Without such national parameters as conversion factors
and social accounting prices, however, it was not possible to reach a firm
conclusion about the program's overall economic success (para. 27).
Sustainability
viii.     The benefits to be derived from the project will depend heavily on
adequate, ongoing maintenance throughout the life of the project. The
institutional improvements achieved under the first project and early in this
project had largely disappeared by project's end. Reinstating the system will
require a commitment to carrying out and monitoring maintenance permanently
(para. 28).
Findings and Lessons Learned
ix.       Five lessons of more general sectoral applicability have been
incorporated into subsequent projects: (1) the adequacy of engineering
designs should be carefully scrutinized at an early stage; (2) proper
prequalification of contractors is indispensable to ensuring timely, cost-



iv -
effective performance; (3) a well-managed project unit should be in place
before the bulk of the project is undertaken; (4) following through with
consultants on road maintenance during implementation may forestall costly
problems     " onu  and (5) constructive, efficient coordination between the
planning      aintenance units is critical to project success (para. 32).

(LOAN 1784-DO)

Loan No.:            1784-DO
RVP Unit:            LA3IE
Countrys            Dominican Republic
Sector:             Transport
Subsector:          Highways and Rural Roads
B. Background
1.        By the late 1970's, the transportation system of the Dominican
Republic was in acute need of major rehabilitation and preventive maintenance.
Years of decline in investments and maintenance funding had left 45Z of the
nation's roads badly deteriorated. Expenditures on transportation averaged
1 of all public sector spending from 1971-76, and most of those expenditures
were on capital investments rather than on operations or maintenance. Because
of poor original design, many roads were obsolete or not amenable to
maintenance. The feeder road network was also in poor condition and in need
of improvement.
2.        Weak planning and coordination in the transport sector was
aggravated throughout the 1970's by a lack of willingness to undertake
explicit planning on a continuous basis. The result was an ad hoc approach to
project selection, a lack of reliable statistics or of systematized data
collection. With respect to rural roads, the institutional situation was
worse still. No one agency had responsibility for construction and
maintenance; consequently, there was no knowledge of the extent, location or
condition of the rural road network.
3.        Nonetheless, poor planning had not brought about major misallocation
of resources. In 1978, the Secretary of State for Public Works and
Communications (SEOPC) of the newly-elected administration decided to adopt a
Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program and establish a Road
Reconstruction Planning Unit. The Government's investment program for 1980-82
included a high priority program for highway reconstruction and strengthening
maintenance capacity, as well as improving the feeder road network. The need
for reconstruction became greater still after hurricanes in August 1979
destroyed 2,400 km of roadways and caused nearly US$500 million in physical
asset damage.
4.        The Bank had previously been involved in the highway subsector
through provision of technical assistance under the 1973 UNDP-financed Highway
Rehabilitation and Administration Study, and through the US$5.0 million First
Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan 1316T-DO), approved in



- 2 -
August 1976. By initiating highway reconstruction and maintenance activities,
the first project prepared the way for more comprehensive programs in the
second.
C. Proiect Obiectives and Description
5.        As described in the appraisal report, the project's objectives were:
(1) To pursue the strengthening and expansion of maintenance
capacity undertaken under the First Road Maintenance and
Reconstruction Project;
(2) To initiate a high priority road reconstruction program for
primary and secondary roads with obsolete pavements:
(3) To demonstrate the field of application of labor-based
techniques for the improvement and maintenance of rural access
roads;
(4) To upgrade SEOPC's maintenance personnel through functional
skill training; and
(5) To build up SEOPC's capacity to plan and program road
reconstruction works through the establishment of a special
unit entrusted with that work.
6.        Among other things, the Government agreed to exchange views with the
Bank each year, at the time of preparation of the budget, on implementation
and financing of the 1980-84 maintenance and reconstruction programs. It also
undertook to give priority in planning highway capital expenditures to the
execution of the remaining tranche of the highway reconstruction program over
other highway capital expenditures not Lncluded in the program.
7.        The project was designed with the following components:
(1) Road Reconstruction
(a) reconstruction and related supervision by consultants, of
150 km of roads covering Phase I of SEOPC's Reconstruction
Program (1980-84);
(b) detailed engineering for the reconstruction of additional
317 km of roads within the framework of the above program;
tc) establishment within SEOPC of a Reconstruction Planning
Unit to plan, program and study the economic feasibility
of SEOPC's Reconstruction Program and provisions of
related technical ass.stance.
(2) Maintenance and Training Proaram: implementation of SEOPC's
five-year (1980-84) highway maintenance program, togiether with



a set of coordinated measures to build up SEOPC's maintenance
capacity includings
(a) renewal and expansion of the equipment fleet;
(b) organizational improvements; training of personnel; end
related technical assistance, such as consolidating
systems for equipment management and accounting for
overall maintenance, p -muing for inclusion of feeder
roads into the maintf -- a system, the establishment of 18
workshops, and select-,S and procuring equipment and spare
parts*
(3) Pilot Rural Roads Proaram: implementation of a two-year (1981-
82) pilot program for the construction of about 200 km of rural
roads employing labor-based techniques, with related
institutional measures and technical assistance.
8.        The project was to be carried out from 1980-84, with the
reconstruction and rural roads programs completed by 1982. The project was
appraised in November 1979, and negotiations took place in Washington
immediately thereafter. A US$35.0 million loan was approved on December 18,
1979; the Loan Agreement was signed January 8, 1980.
D. Proiect Desia n and Oraanization
9.        The principal sectoral objective was to provide an adequate road
infrastructure and systems of maintenance to minimize the transport cost of
goods moving on the Republic's roads, mostly low-value, high-volume
agricultural products, minerals, and imported goods.
10.       The reconstruction component consisted of raisirg and widening the
platform along existing alignments and improving cross-drainage. Execution
was the responsibility of SEOPC's General Directorate of Highways using local
contractors, with supervision entrusted to a consortium of a foreign
consulting firm and local consultants.
11.       The maintenance and trainina program called for new procedures to be
introduced -'tionwide.  The Government agreed to separate the maintenance
budget frot t,ther SEOPC activities, and set a target of 752 average equipment
availability and 70Z utilization, for a resulting total fleet utilization of
52Z. Execution was given to the General Directorate of Highways. Traninag
was to be geared toward supervisors, equipment operators, mechanics,
accountants and administrative personnel, and administered by the Highway
Directorate's Training Unit.
12.       The pilot rural roads program called for the construction of about
200 km of roads using labor-intensive methods, to be followed by an assessment
of its success. The minimum wage at the time was considered too high to make
labor-intensive construction competitive with a more traditional labor-
equipment mix. Accordingly, the Government agreed to cover the additional
costs in order to test the social value of the labor-based techniques,



-4-
especially their effect on employment. The program was to be executed by the
General Directorate of Rural Roads.
13.       It was observed at appraisal that all the executing units had
adequate capacity for their tasks, but in light of the project's unprecedented
size, the agencies' performance would require close Bank review.
E. Project Im,lementation
14.       Road Reconstruction.  Although the 1 an was signed in January 1980,
it did not become effective until September 1980 as a result of congressional
delay. Because of this late start, bid opening for the road reconstruction
contracts was delayed, and the contracts were not awarded until 1981. Almost
immediately, this component of the project ran into problems. Three of the
original project designs by local consultants turned out to be inadequate or
incomplete, requiring total redesign. Although the contractors had undergone
prequalification, the process was flawed and produced an overly optimistic
estimate of their capacity. The contracts were subsequently revised,
renegotiated and signed in November 1983 at a cost increase of nearly US$4.0
million, or 20Z. As a result, the Government had to reduce design standards
on one road that had been slated for reconstruction.
15.       In the early years, implementation suffered from poor organization,
SEOPC's inadequate managerial skills, contractors' lack of resources and
equipment, and constraints in counterpart funds. By midterm, road
reconstruction was already two years behind schedule, and SEOPC had fallen
behind in its payments to contractors, prompting further delays. The
supervision of SEOPC by a consortium of consultants, hampered at first by lack
of coordination with SEOPC, later improved. But the delays in reconstruction
contracts required renegotiating the supervision contracts as well, at an
additional cost of US$1.6 million. Poor procedures in SEOPC coupled with lack
of financial information slowed budgeting and accounting. In addition, bids
on certain sections were coming in well above appraisal estimates. By January
1983, supervision reports foresaw a cost overrun of US$6.8 million, with more
than USA33 million of work yet to be done but only US$18 million left in the
loan account. Remaining counterpart funds were only half of the US$14 million
required.
16.       At the same time, the Emergency Road Reconstruction Project (Loan
1783-DO), approved in the wake of the 1979 hurricane, faced an even greater
shortfall, with less than US$1.0 million remaining in its account.
Considering two of the sections to be repaired under the emergency loan as
priorities, the Bank in April 1983 approved an amendment to the Loan Agreement
for loan 1784-DO by which funds from this project would finance their repair.
This increased to 300 km the amount of roadway to be reconstructed; it also
consumed some US$7 million of loan resources and left a US$19 million
financing gap. Accordingly, talks began with the Government on a Third Road
Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (subsequently approved as Loan 2609-
DO). Performance problems with contractors continued, becoming so serious in
two instances that one contract was rescinded and another canceled. Finding
new contractors introduced still more delay.



-5-
17.       In late 1983, costs rose again as the Dominican currency was
devalued and import prices rose faster than forecast. By the end of 1984,
work on reconstruction was only half done dnd at a standstill, leaving
unfinished road repairs exposed to the damaging effects of weather and
traffic. At project closing in June 1985, none of the original five segments
slated for reconstruction was complete: all had to be carried over into the
Third Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan 2609-DO, approved in
August 1985), where they were subsequently finished.
18.       The other two subcomponents of the road reconstruction program were
completed with little difficulty. Consultants trained SEOPC's project
management office to perform administrative and monitoring tasks, and helped
SEOPC establish a working Planning Development Department. For all its
management problems at .he outset, SEOPC was considerably stronger by the
project's end. Follow-up technical assistance was provided under Loan 2609-
DO. The detailed engineering studies for reconstruction of an additional 317
km of roads were finished by late 1984.
19.       The initial delays set in motion a series of problems from which the
project could not escape, which were compounded by the need to reallocate loan
funds to emergency works and unforeseen cost increases in 1983 and 1984. At
the same time, appraisal probably overestimated the local contractors's
capacity, and it appears initial designs should have been more carefully
reviewed. What is more, the risk identified at appraisal that the works
envisioned might exceed SEOPC's capacity turned out to be correct. SEOPC's
failings were evidenced in its lack of control over works, cost increases, low
quality of much of the work, and the granting of contracts to unqualified
contractors.
20.       Maintenance and Trainina Program.  This program started smoothly and
ultimately succeeded in its more limited objectives, although it fell short of
its more ambitious goals. Its success depended on renewing and expanding
SEOPC's equipment fleet. By the end of 1981, all maintenance and training
equipment had been procured through international competitive bidding and put
into operation. The technical assistance program was completed in March 1982
at a total cost of US$846,000, and included the creation of an Assistant Sub-
Directorate for Maintenance, 18 workshops, inventories of roads and equipment,
and field manuals on highway maintenance. Specific targets proved elusive,
however. By mid-1982, equipment availability was at 65Z and utilization at
502, for a total fleet availability of 32.5X. This fell short of appraisal
forecasts, largely because of delays in buying spare parts and fuels.
21.       During the First Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project, SEOPC
had developed and tested in two districts a practical system for annually
programming maintenance activities. The second loan was to support its
introduction nationwide, but did not succeed. Beginning in 1982, the most
qualified people began leaving SEOPC for higher salaries elsewhere. The
result was excessive loss of institutional memory which affected the rest of
the term of the maintenance program. Training of highway maintenance staff
suffered because of turnover, as well as lack of equipment, inefficient use of
the Road Training Production Unit and delays in paying per diems to those
attending. Some programs collapsed before ever getting started. In 1983,



-6-
SEOPC created the General Directorate of Maintenance, which was well designed,
but training all but ceased for lack of funds. By mid-1983, turf battles
between the Maintenance and Equipment directorates were obstructing attempts
to improve and modernize maintenance operations. SEOPC resolved the issue in
June 1984 by reorganizing the units and putting the General Directorate of
Equipment squarely under the General Directorate of Maintenance. The
clarified lines of responsibility increased the efficiency and quality of
work. But by project closing, training for equipment repair and maintenance
had fallen so far behind that it was left to be finished under Loan 2609-DO.
22.       Pilot Rural Roads Program.  This pilot program was beset almost from
the beginning by delays and by the Borrower's persistent failure to provide
sufficient local funds. Consequently, the program dragged well beyond its
planned two years and never produced conclusive results on the issue it was
designed to resolve. Shortly after a Labor-Based Construction Unit was
established in the General Directorate of Rural Roads, the program stalled for
lack of transportation for technical staff and a shortage of hauling
equipment. By the time these problems had been worked out, budgeted resources
from the Ministry of Finance had become so scarce that payments to field labor
were chronically delayed. Staff changes were frequent and procurement slow.
At the-end of 1983, three years after effectiveness, work ceased entirely with
work completed on only 9 of 74 km of roads which should have been done. A
Bank supervision mission warned that work had to resume on the remaining 65 km
to prevent deterioration. To expedite the work, the Loan Agreement was
amended on May 2, 1984 to raise the Bank's disbursement percentage on the
rural roads works from 63Z to lOOZ.
23.       Work resumed for a time after the amendment, but only about 100 km
of the 200 km originally foreseen was ever completed. After project closing,
a foreign consulting firm reviewed the completed segments and issued a report
at the end of 1986. The report could reach no firm conclusions about the
cost-effectiveness of labor-based techniques, but did determine that such
methods were feasible primarily in depressed regions (such as near the Haitian
border! where employment itself was the highest priority. In March 1987, a
supervision mission recommended that future rural road work be conducted by
local contract only. In February 1989, SEOPC confirmed in a letter to the
Bank that it had no plans to use any of the funds of Loan 2609-DO for rural
road improvements.
F. Proiect Results
24.       Road Reconstruction.  The higher costs occasioned by the need for
corrected designs and renegotiated contracts resulted in a lower rate of
return for the road projects than had been foreseen: 15Z rather than the 23?
estimated at appraisal. The sensitivity analysis shows that the ERR, even
under adverse assumptions, reaches an overall value of nearly 122.
25.       Variations in traffic volume from those projected during appraisal
were minor for most segments of the roads, with two exceptions. The Santo
Domingo-San Isidro stretch was estimated to carry 6,100 vehicles/day in 1979,
but historical traffic data show only 2,000 vehicles/day. On the sections C/C



Los Llanos-C/C San Pedro and Boca Chica-C/C Boca Chica, truck traffic has been
about 302 lower than estimated.
26.       Road Maintenance ProRram.  Financial expenses for this program were
RD$104 million for the 1981-85 period, expressed in constant 1979 prices.
This includes about RD$7.44 million per year paid to non-essential personnel,
leaving RD$66.8 million for maintenance activities. The economic analysis
yields an ERR of 272, compared with appraisal forecasts of more than 1002 ERR.
Several reasons contributed to the lower returns: delays in acquiring
maintenance equipment and spare parts; maintenance programs targeted to
emergency tasks rather than toward preventive and periodic treatment;
deterioration of maintenance equipment because of its use for reconstruction;
and delays in supply of maintenance materials arising from cumbersome
administrative procedures within SEOPC.
27.       Pilot Rural Roads Program.  This program was only partially
realized. Only about half the forecast road segments were completed, and the
program never generated enough information to determine if, in fact, labor-
intensive techniques were more socially cost-effective. The financial costs
of construction were shown to be higher as a result of the extra use of labor,
but without national parameters (conversion factors, social accounting prices,
shadow wages), it was not possible to ascertain the success of the program.
SEOPC support to the program, never strong, declined over time. Meanwhile,
rural road construction contracts being carried out through USAID, assigning
specific road sections to local residents who were paid on a part-time basis
and using equipment purchased with USAID funds, proved more successful and
received greater cooperation from SEOPC. Eventually, SEOPC decided to use
only USAID and the IDB for rural roads financing.
G. Project Sustainability
28.       The benefits to be derived from the project will depend heavily on
adequate, ongoing maintenance throughout the life of the project. One major
risk to the project arises, therefore, from the weakness of SEOPC's road
maintenance system. The institutional and operational improvements achieved
during the First Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project, and early in
this project, had largely disappeared by the end of this project. Only weak
coordination remained between the planning and programming unit (at the
General Directorate of Planning level) and the road maintenance unit (at the
General Directorate of Road Maintenance level). Reinstating the system will
require more than merely involving different road units in preparing the
annual maintenance budget and execution program; a serious commitment to
carrying out and monitoring maintenance on a permanent basis will be
necessary. The Fifth Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, to be
presented for approval in 1991, focuses on road maintenance and includes an
agreed five-year maintenance plan as well as technical assistance to implement
this plan and to introduce new road pavement technologies.
H. General Performance
29.       Loan 1784-DO arose from a mutual understanding between the Borrower
and the Bank as to which priorities were urgent and the Borrower's capacity to



address them. This provided the impetus to a long term, high-profile road
reconstruction program for primary and secondary roads.
30.       The project was designed in part to deal with the Borrower's
institutional weaknesses through technical assistance and expanded maintenance
capacity. This effort was not successful and at the end left a maintenance
management organization in decline which may jeopardize the long-term benefits
of the project. In retrospect. Bank supervision missions did not insist
strenuously enough on the importance of maintenance management; a new effort
will now have to be mounted. As stated in para. 28 above, this is precisely
the focus of the proposed new rehabilitation project. The Borrower also
failed to install a well-organized, conmprehensive information system for the
project. The centralized Departamento Administrativo de Recursos Externos
(DARE) should evolve toward a project unit design in which each unit would
maintain its own organized project database and then forward to DARE only the
information necessary to exercise general accounting and financial control
functions. Again, the proposed new project includes the establishment of a
project unit headed by a highly capable technical officer.
31.       There were three issues that pertained to both the First and Second
Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Projects. First, Government delays in
providing local funding can cause even greater delays in the progress of the
project. Second, there was chronic underestimation of unit prices and,
consequently, of overall project costs. Third, potential institutional
constraints should be rigorously assessed from the beginning so as to avoid
the recurrent bottlenecks and inadequate control that hampered implementation
of this project. The first of these requires only that Government commit
sufficient resources for project implementation and honor those commitments.
The last two can be addressed by upgrading the capability of the planning
units within SEOPC and providing better project control and monitoring. These
issues were addressed under the Third Road Maintenance and Reconstruction
Loan, where substantial technical assistance was provided to the Planning
Department of the SEOPC. The department upgraded the capability to prepare
road engineering studies and to screen projects based on their economic
priority.
I. Findings and Lessons Learned
32.       Five lessons of more general sectoral applicability can be gleaned
from the project. First, the adequacy of engineering designs should be
carefully scrutinized as early as possible in the project cycle, preferably
before appraisal. Second, proper prequalification of contractors is
indispensable to ensuring timely, cost-effective performance. Third, a weli-
managed project unit should be in place before the bulk of the project is
undertaken. Fourth, following through with consultants on road maintenance
during implementation may forestall costly problems later on. Fifth and
finally, constructive, efficient coordination between the planning and
maintenance units is critical to project success.
33.       The Fifth Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, currently
under consideration, includes the following measures to build on these
lessons: (1) preliminary engineering studies were prepared thoroughly, and



-9-
detailed engineering for the first year of the project was available before
negotiations; (2) a new prequalification document was agreed upon to avoid
selection of unsuitable contractors; (3) a project management unit is to be
put in place; (4) substantial assistance is provided to actual implementation
of a road maintenance plan and road pavement technology transfer; and (5) a
mechanism was established to ensure use of the same database and permanent
consultations between SEOPC's Planning Department and the Directorate of
Maintenance.

PART II: BORROWER'S COMMENTS
1.        This completion report is more than four years overdue.  Given that
the Borrower's management in place at the time of the project have all been
replaced, it is the judgment of the managing division that little information
of value would be gained by soliciting the Borrower for contributions. In
accordance with Bank Guidelines, therefore, it has not been submitted to the
Borrower for comment. The report itself, however, will be translated and sent
to the Borrower so the lessons to be learned can be effectively shared with
current road sector management.
