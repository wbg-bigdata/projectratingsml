EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The proposed co-generation expansion project at Kakira Sugar Works (1985) Limited
(KSW) is an exciting project that is utilising a waste material to produce electricity for
Uganda. Even though the amount of bagasse combustion will be no different with or
with out the project, the benefits are the production of electricity and the reduction of
diesel fuel currently used for loading and transporting the 113,000 tonnes of surplus
bagasse'to the fields for disposal (buming).
Introduction
The Kakira Sugar Works (1985) Limited (KSW) is located 16 kilometres east of the town
of Jinja in central Uganda. Currently, the enterprise is crushing sugar cane at the rate of
over 3000 tonnes of cane crushing per day (TCD) and employs over 6,000 workers
throughout its operations. KSW plans to expand this capacity by to a rate of 5000 TCD,
a goal that will involve upgrading of the plant capacity. To achieve the expanded
production target, expansion of the sugar factory with modifications to some processes
will be required. Engineering feasibility studies and plans have been prepared for this
project. KSW prepared and submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for
the overall expansion program to the Govemment of Uganda National Environmental
Management Agency (NEMA). Approval for the project was received in November
1998.
Kakira currently employs a cogeneration facility utilizing the solid cane waste, known as
bagasse, to generate electricity for the facility. Due to a need for additional electricity
generation capacity in the grid network, KSW submitted a proposal to the Govemment of
Uganda offering to expand its cogeneration facility beyond its own needs and supply
electricity to the national grid network. KSW proposes to supply up to 7 MW of electricity
to Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) for six hours per day
during the peak period from 1800 hours to 2400 hours.
KSW has developed a phased expansion program for the expansion of the factory and
the cogeneration facilities. The current phase comprises a plan to expand production to
4000 TCD and install a new cogeneration facility of 14-15 MW. The proposed project
includes installation of additional boilers, turbo-generator, related piping, cabling,
electrical equipment, instrumentation and control systems, and additional bagasse
handling equipment. A new electrical sub-station at Kakira and a new 33 kV distribution
line from Kakira to UEDCL's Jinja Industrial Sub-station at Mailombili will be constructed
and allocation to UEDCL.
KSW has requested financial support of the cogeneration portion of the project through
the Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) program.

Environmental Assessment
Completion of an environmental assessment, in accordance with World Bank policy, is a
requirement under the ERT. As such, this Environmental Assessment report focuses on
the KSW new cogeneration facility and the relevant aspects of the related investments
including the electrical substation. An assessment of the new distmbution line will be
completed following determination of the route.
Information on the project was obtained from KSW, consultants, published literature,
previous environmental reports, and literature and internet searches. Discipline
specialists were contacted to help describe the project and the environment.
Potential Environmental Effects
Potential environmental effects of the proposed cogeneration project were identified
using scoping methods, interaction matrix techniques, and professional judgement.
Mitigation measures were identified to eliminate, reduce and control environmental
effects determined to be adverse. Follow-up was proposed to vepify the accuracy of the
assessment and determine the effectiveness of mitigation measures. The significance
of the residual environmental effects remaining after mitigation were then evaluated.
Potential environmental effects of the proposed project were determined to be:
* Increased noise
* Increased emissions
* Increased dust
* Reduced soil quality (spills and disposal)
* Decreased groundwater quality (spills)
* Decreased surface water quality (discharges)
* Adverse effects on mammals and birds (waste disposal and storage)
* Attraction of nuisance species (waste disposal)
* Changes in employment opportunities
* Reduced human health (noise, drinking water quality, air emissions)
Summary information on potential environmental effects is provided in Table ES-1,
attached.
Environmental and Social Management Plan
A number of mitigation measures and follow-up requirement are identified in this
environmental assessment report. Some of the main measures include:
x Controlling the timing of noise generation to least disruptive periods, as practicable,
and monitoring noise levels as required. Hearing protection will be provided to
employees working in high noise areas. Corrective actions will be taken on an as-
required basis.
X  To minimize air emissions from vehicle and equipment use, Kakira will ensure that
vehicles and equipment are inspected and maintained on a regular basis and that
ii

they will not be left idling when not in use. No ozone depleting substances will be
used or generated from equipment during construction.
. The boilers will be equipped with a full wet scrubber to reduce the amount of ash
released into the environment.
x Kakira will develop a spill prevention plan, prepare and implement chemical handling
and storage procedures and train employees about their use.
A Concrete berms will be constructed around areas where liquids are stored to contain
any spillage
X Spill kits will be maintained in all fuel and chemical storage areas for quick access if
needed
Work will be monitored during construction to ensure there are no releases of
deleterious substances.
x Refuelling and maintenance of equipment will be conducted in designated locations
only.
Workers handling chemicals will be provided training in chemical safety and
adequate personal protective equipment.
x  All water and dirt from transformers produced during maintenance activities will be
collected and treated as hazardous waste.
. A waste disposal site will be properly sited and designed.
x  A spill prevention plan will be developed.
x  Spill containment supplies will be kept on-site in case of fuel leak.
x  Storage of fuels and other hazardous materials will be conducted in designated
locations only.
x  Kakira's overall expansion plan includes a wastewater treatment system including:
w Oil, grease and grit separation
A primary settling and flow equalisation pond
An anaerobic pond
An aerobic pond
'  Kakira will commit to reducing water use to minimize the wastewater generated.
X  Obtain permit from NEMA to operate waste disposal site
X  Proper siting and formal design will allow for vermin breeding control
x  Dispose of waste at a licensed off-site facility
X  Create additional jobs in other locations within the factory for displaced workers

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
The Kakira Sugar Works (1985) Limited (KSW) property covers over 9000 hectares of
land and is located 16 kilometres east of the town of Jinja in central Uganda. Currently,
the enterprise is crushing sugar cane at the rate of over 3000 tonnes of cane crushing
per day (TCD) and employs over 6,000 workers (including contract employees)
throughout its operations. KSW plans to expand this capacity to a rate of 5000 TCD, a
goal that will involve upgrading of the plant capacity.
Kakira currently employs a cogeneration facility utilizing the solid cane waste, known as
bagasse, to generate electricity for the facility. Due to a need for additional electricity
generation capacity in the grid network, KSW submitted a proposal to the Govemment of
Uganda offering to expand its cogeneration facility beyond its own needs and supply
electricity to the national grid network.
KSW originally proposed to provide the Ministry of Energy of the Govemment of Uganda
with 18 MW of electricity to the grid on a 24-hour per day basis. However, demand
forecasts prepared by the Uganda Electricity Board / Uganda Electricity Transmission
Company Limited (UETCL) indicated that this quantum of electricity would be greater
than what could be sold. KSW therefore reduced its cogeneration project to supply up to
7 MW of electricity to UETCL for six hours per day during the peak period from 1800
hours to 2400 hours.
To achieve the expanded production target, expansion of the sugar factory with
modifications to some processes will be required. Engineering feasibility studies and
plans have been prepared for this project. KSW prepared and submitted an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the overall expansion program to the
Govemment of Uganda National Environmental Management Agency (NEMA).
Approval for the project was received in November 1998.
KSW has developed a phased expansion program for the expansion of the factory and
the cogeneration facilities. The current phase comprises a plan to expand production to
4000 TCD and install a new cogeneration facility of 14-15 MW. The proposed project
includes installation of additional boilers, turbo-generator, related piping, cabling,
electrical equipment, instrumentation and control systems, and additional bagasse
handling equipment. A new electrical sub-station at Kakira and a new 33 kV distribution
line from Kakira to UEDCL's Jinja Industrial Sub-station at Mailombili will be constructed
and allocation to UEDCL.
KSW has requested financial support of the cogeneration portion of the project through
the Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) program. Completion of an environmental
assessment, in accordance with World Bank policy, is a requirement under the ERT. As
such, this Environmental Assessment report focuses,on the KSW new cogeneration

substation. An assessment of the new distribution line will be completed following
determination of the route.
1.2 ASSESSMENT METHODS
Background information was acquired from a wide range of sources, including Ugandan
government internet sites, consultant reports, documentation by public-interest groups,
and publications of Ugandan legislation and policies.
1.2.1   REVIEW OF EXISTING INFORMATION
The consultant team obtained and reviewed information on the proposed project, KSW
property descriptions and use, and the surrounding environment. Information sources
included KSW documents, photographs, NEMA data, engineering drawings, and
geological, hydrogeological and hydrological data. Information deficiencies were
identified during this process. Information requests were presented to KSW.
1.2.2   SCOPE
The scope of the assessment includes a determination of the environmental effects to be
addressed and the effects to be considered in making decisions regarding the project.
The scope of this environmental assessment was determined by the World Bank and
was described in the Terms of Reference for the Environmental Assessment of the
proposed project, which is provided in Appendix A.
Appendix E provides comments received from the World Bank on the draft report and
the clients' and consultants' respective response to these comments. Appendix F
provides the minutes of the Public Consultation Meeting held at the suggestion of the
World Bank.
1.2.3   PROJECT COMPONENTS, PHASES AND ACTIVITIES
Project components were identified by the consultant team from an examinabon of
project documentation and through consultations with the consultant engineers and
representatives from KSW. Three components were identified for the project:
1) Factory Expansion
2) Cogeneration Expansion
3) Substation Construction
An additional component, comprising the construction of the 33 KV distribution line, will
be assessed at a future date when the project is more developed. No construction on the
transmission line will occur until the environmental assessment, including a resettlement
plan, if required, has been cleared and disclosed by the World Bank.
Two project phases were identified:
1. Construction

2. Operation and maintenance
Project activities for each of the above project components were identified by the
consultant team through an examination of project documentation and through
consultations with the consultant engineers. A detailed project description, including the
components and activities, is presented in Section 3.
1.2.4   ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENTS
Environmental components were identified by the consultant team after examining
reference documents, conducting a site visit, discussing environmental conditions with
KSW, and contacting relevant environmental authorities.
BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
Components of the biophysical environment described include:
A air quality
x  noise
x bedrock and surficial geology
x soils
x hydrogeology
x hydrology
X terrestnal biota and habitat
A aquatic biota and habitat
SOCIO-ECONOMIc ENVIRONMENT
The description of the socio-economic environment includes information on the function
and structure of the socio-economic environment in the study area, demographics,
infrastructure, and existing and planned land uses.
1.2.5   IDENTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
Environmental effects were identified for the project using a combination of methods
including:
x Expert consultation
x A multidisciplinary team brainstorming process
x Interaction matrices
An environmental effect is any change that the project may cause in the environment.
The World Bank defines environment as 'the natural and social conditions surrounding
all.. .mankind, and including future generations". For the purpose of this environmental
assessment, the term "environmental effect' includes any change that the project may
cause to the environment, including any effect of such change on:

x  Biophysical conditions
k  Health and socioeconomic conditions (resulting directly from environmental effects)
X  Sustainable use of resources
x  Current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes.
The multidisciplinary consultant team's professional judgement was used to complete a
project activity / environmental component interaction matrix. The team comprised
experts in environmental science, biology, soil science, hydrogeology, and
environmental engineering.
Potential interactions between project activities and environmental components were
indicated on an interaction matrix for the subject site. Interactions were denoted with
open and closed circles. Open circles were used to denote interactions that would not
result in a change from baseline conditions; consequently, these interactions were not
discussed further. Closed circles were used to identify interactions that could lead to a
direct adverse environmental effect and/or indirect social effect requiring mitigation.
Negative or adverse direct environmental effects and indirect social effects are
discussed in Section 5.
1.2.6   RESIDUAL EFFECTS
Residual effects, or the effects remaining after the implementation of mitigation, were
evaluated using a number of criteria relating to both biophysical and socioeconomic
components. Criteria used include:
x  Magnitude of effect
x  Frequency of occurrence
X  Duration
X  ProbabilityAikelihood
x  Reversibility
k  Geographic extent
These criteria are briefly described below and in Table 1.
MAGNITUDE OF EFFECT
Magnitude is an estimation of the extent of change to the environment caused by the
project, based on predicted deviations from baseline conditions. For this project,
magnitude was categorized as:
*   Low (L) - a measurable change from background conditions but no lasting effect(s)
on the environment.
*   Medium (M) - a measurable change from background conditions with localized
and/or short-term effect(s) on the environment.

High (H) - a measurable change from background conditions with widespread and
long-term effect(s) on the environment.
FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE
Frequency relates to the number of times a project activity and/or an environmental
effect will occur. An infrequent event, occurring once per year, was defined as having
low (L) frequency. An event having a medium (M) frequency corresponds to an effect
that occurs intermittently throughout the year. The term high (H) frequency was applied
to any event occurring on a daily basis.
DURATION
Duration is the length of time that potential effects or activities could last. The duration
of effect(s) may or may not be related to the durafion of a particular activity.
Environmental effects and/or activities expected to last less than one month were
considered short-term, or of low (L) duration. Environmental effects and/or activities
expected to last between one to 18 months were considered medium-term, with medium
(M) duration. Any effects or activities expected to last beyond 18 months were
considered a long-term, or of long (H) duration for the purposes of this assessment.
PROBABILITY! LIKELIHOOD
Probability is the chance or likelihood that an effect will occur in the environment.
Probabilities were assigned as follows:
Low (L)      <20% probability
x  Medium (M)   20% to 70% probability
x  High (H)     >70% probability
The above values were selected based upon professional judgement.
REVERSIBILITY
An effect is considered reversible if, through natural or human processes, the
environment returns to the original conditions present before exposure to the effect.
Reversible effects were designated as (L). If the environment cannot recover naturally,
the effect is considered irreversible and designated as (H).
GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT
Geographic extent describes the area over which the environment is subject to potential
effects. Defining spatial boundaries establishes a frame of reference for identifying and
evaluating environmental effects. Geographic areas examined for this project include
the Project Study Area and Local Study Area. The geographic extent over which the
residual effect may have an influence was classified as low (L) if the effect remained
within the Project Study Area, medium (M) if the effect influenced the Local Study Area,
and high (H) if the effect influenced an area beyond the Local Study Area.

1.2.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF RESIDUAL EFFECTS
The residual environmental effects of each project component (construction, operation,
and maintenance) were assigned an overall significance rating based on their predicted
influence on the terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric, and socioeconomic environments.
In assessing the significance of effects, the most important criterion was magnitude and
the application of other criteria was dependent on the rating for magnitude.
The following criteria were used to determine if the significance of the residual effects
was high:

2.0 POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
FRAMEWORK
The following sections provide a summary of the pertinent intemational, national,
regional and local regulations and standards under which KSW must follow.
2.1 ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
2.1.1   NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
Following the enactment of the National Environment Statute (NES) 1995, the National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) was created and charged with the
responsibility to oversee, coordinate and supervise environmental management in
Uganda. NEMA's overall goal is to promote sound environmental management and
prudent use of natural resources in Uganda.
Since its formation in 1995, NEMA has put a strong emphasis on developing
environmental policies, laws and guidelines as evidenced by the large number of
environmental regulations that have been enacted over the last few years. Safeguard
policy issues are addressed through these regulations, including environmental impact
assessment (EIA) regulations. NEMA is responsible for EIA review and monitoring of the
implementation of environmental mitigation measures.
2.1.2   DIRECTORATE OF WATER DEVELOPMENT (DWD)
The right to investigate, control, protect and manage water in Uganda for any use, is
vested in the Govemment and exercised by the Director of DWD in accordance with the
provisions in the Water Statute (1995). DWD is the Secretariat for the Water Policy
Committee. The duties and roles of DWD include, among others, carrying out inventory
of water resources and preparation, update and revision of water action plans, revision,
variation and cancellation of water and wastewater discharge permits. These permits are
approved in collaboration with major stakeholders such as NEMA.
Regulations under the Water Statute include:
a  The Water (Waste Discharge) Regulations, 1998
a  The Water Resources Regulations, 1998
a The Sewerage Regulations, 1999
a  The Water Supply Regulations, 1999
The statute provides for the management of water in Uganda and is under the mandate
of DWD in the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment. Section 31, subsection (1) of
the Water Statute deals with prohibition of pollution to water and stipulates that a person
commits an offence who, unless authorised under this Statute, causes or allows waste to

come into contact with any water; waste to be discharged directly or indirectly into water;
or water to be polluted.
Under section 107, the Water (Waste Discharge) Regulations (1998); the Water Supply
Regulations (1999) and the Sewerage Regulations (1999) have been put in place to
operationalise the Statute and are aimed at minimising pollution of public waters by
developers and other users. These regulations give procedures for obtaining water
abstraction and effluent discharge permits from DWD.
2.1.3   UGANDA WILDLIFE AUTHORITY
The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) was established under the Uganda Wildlife Statute
(1996). The main function of the UWA is to ensure sustainable management of wildlife
in conservation areas by coordinating, monitoring and supervising wildlife management
issues; however, UWA can manage wildlife (wild plant and wild animals native to
Uganda) in both protected and unprotected areas.
2.1.4   ELECTRICITY REGULATORY AUTHORITY
Under the Electricity Act (1999), the Electricity Regulatory Authority is responsible for
issuing license for the generation, transmission, distribution and/or sale of electricity.
2.1.5   WORLD BANK
Environmental Assessment is used in the World Bank to examine the potential
environmental risks and benefits associated with projects proposed for Bank financing.
The Bank's environmental assessment policy and procedures are described in OP/BP
(Operational Policy/Bank Procedures) 4.01. Environmental Assessment is one of the 10
environmental and social Safeguard Policies of the World Bank. The Environmental and
Social Management Framework, which also includes a resettlement policy framework,
will be referred to especially when resettlement issues are to be assessed during
consultations for the transmission line. The World Bank's Policy on involuntary
resettlement will be triggered and the policy will be used as guidance to prepare
resettlement/compensation plan as needed during the assessment of the transmission
line.
2.2 PROGRAMS, REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES
2.2.1   ENERGY FOR RURAL TRANSFORMATION (ERT) PROGRAM (2001)
This is a Govemment of Uganda program aimed to bring electricity to currently unserved
rural areas. The goal is to facilitate economic transformation of the rural economy via
provision of energy services. The project is focused on the private sector as the primary
service provider. The World Bank provides funding assistance for implementation of the
ERT program.
All ERT projects must comply with the applicable environmental and social safeguard
policies of the Government of Uganda and the World Bank, including Environmental

Impact Assessment. NEMA is responsible for the review of the EIA and the monitoring
of the implementation of environmental mitigation measures.
For ERT projects, the WB Environmental Assessment categories apply. Most ERT
projects are classified under Category B.
2.2.2   THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT STATUTE (1995)
Following the enactment of the National Environment Statute (NES) 1995, the National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) was created and charged with the
responsibility to oversee, coordinate and supervise environmental management in
Uganda.
The NES details environmental planning issues; environmental regulation;
environmental management; control of pollution; environmental restoration orders and
environmental easements; records, inspection and analysis; information, education and
public awareness; and financial provisions. In addition, offences, judicial proceedings,
intemational obligation and miscellaneous provisions are included. Regulations and
guidelines have been or are in the process of being developed.
A Environmental Regulation (Part V) - including environmental impact assessment,
auditing and monitoring.
( Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1998 - a developer is
responsible for conducting an environmental assessment of any project that may
have, will likely have, or will have an impact on the environment (NES 20(1) (3 a,
b, c)). The objective of the assessment is to determine the possible
environmental impacts of a proposed project and measures to mitigate their
effects. Terms of reference, including study format and contents, methodology,
public participation and any other relevant matters, are developed by the
proponent in consultation with NEMA and any other agencies involved. NEMA
and the lead agency review the assessment report. The public also has an
opportunity to comment on the report. The Executive Director of NEMA makes a
decision regarding the assessment based on the validity of the predictions made,
public comments, an analysis of the economic and social impacts of the project,
and any other important factors (Part VI Section 24(1). A post-assessment audit
of the project must be completed within 36 months of the project.
Environmental Audit Guidelines (1999) - According to the National Environment
Statute 1995 (Section 23), NEMA shall, in conjunction with the lead agency, be
responsible for carrying out an environmental audit of the activities that are likely
to have significant effect on the environment. These guidelines outline
requirements, procedures and methods for carrying out an environmental audit in
Uganda. Environmental Audit Regulations are in advanced stages of
preparation.

(Standards for Discharge of Effluent into Water or on Land) Regulations (1999),
Minimum Standards for Management of Soil Quality Regulations (2001) and The
National Environment (Noise Standards and Control) Regulations, 2003 are in place.
Environmental standards on air quality are still in draft form.
Other regulations that have been developed under Section 108 of the NES include the
National Environment (Wetlands, River banks and Lake Shores Management)
Regulations (2000), National Environment (Waste Management) Regulations (1999) and
Management of Ozone Depleting Substances and Products Regulations (2001).
x. Regulation 4 of the National Environment (Waste Management) Regulations
(1999) describes the sorting and disposal of domestic waste and provides that the
generator of domestic waste may, without a licence issued under these regulations,
dispose of non-hazardous waste in an environmentally sound manner in accordance
with by-laws made by a competent local authority.
x  The National Environment (Waste Management) Regulations (1999) also directly
mentions the application of cleaner production as a means to minimise production of
wastes. Regulation 5 (1) states that: A person who owns or controls a facility or
premises which generate waste shall minimise the waste generated by adopting the
following cleaner production methods:
Improvement of production processes through:
- Conserving raw materials and energy;
- Eliminating the use of toxic raw materials;
- Reducing toxic emissions and wastes
Monitoring the product cycle from beginning to end by:
- Identifying and eliminating potential negative impacts of the product;
- Enabling the recovery and reuse of the product where possible;
- Reclamation and recycling;
Incorporating environmental concems in the design and disposal of a product.
The Executive Director of NEMA may give directions in writing to any person or class of
persons to apply specifically stated methods of cleaner production. This is to achieve
the goals of cleaner production stated in the directive.
2.2.3   THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACT (1964 )
Section 7 of the Act provides local authorities with administrative powers to take all
lawful, necessary and reasonable practicable measures for preventing the occurrence
of, or for dealing with any outbreak or prevalence of, any infectious communicable or
preventable disease to safeguard and promote the public health and to exercise the

3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED
PROJECT
3.1 LOCATION
Kakira Sugar Works is located 16 km east of the town of Jinja and 100 km east of
Kampala in central Uganda, with the shore of Lake Victoria at its southem edge (Figure
1).
The enterprise was originally established in 1927 by the Madhvani family. At the time of
establishment, the facility's crushing capacity was 150 tonnes of sugar cane per day. By
1972, the enterprise was crushing approximately 3000 tonnes of sugar cane per day and
producing 85 000 tonnes of sugar per year. Between 1972 and 1985, the factory was
closed and operations ceased due to the political turmoil in Uganda at that time. In
March 1985, a new company, Kakira Sugar Works (1985) Limited, also owned by the
Madhvani family, was incorporated and an expanded and modernized facility resumed
operation.
3.2 CURRENT OPERATIONS
A general site plan of the Kakira sugar factory is provided as Figure 2. Flow diagrams of
the sugar manufacturing process are presented in Figures 3 (generic) and 4 (detailed).
Wastes generated by the process during the 2002 - 2003 season are listed in Table 3,
below.

The following is a brief descnption of the sugar manufacturing process.
3.2. 1   SUGAR CANE PROCESSING
GROWING AND HANDLING
Sugar cane, the raw material for the process, is cultivated and grown on extensive cane
fields on Kakira property. Harvesting is done by hand with machetes or by mechanical
cutters. At present, Kakira estates produces about 470 000 tonnes of cane per year,
while outgrowers contribute 430 000 tonnes of cane per year, for a total of 900 000
tonnes of cane per year, or over 3000 TCD. There are currently approximately 3,600
outgrowers registered with Kakira, cultivating around 9000 hectares of sugar cane.
Kakira has received approval from NEMA to proceed with an outgrowers development
program to increase the number of outgrowers from 3,600 to 4,200, cultivating about 12
000 hectares of soil.
The cane from the fields is transported by truck or tractor and trailer to the cane yard
adjacent to the sugar-processing factory. The cane is weighed and unloaded from the
vehicles by grab unloaders, manually offloading or dumping. Cane loaded onto the
ground is stacked and then transferred to the main cane carrier by a Cameco unloader
for processing as required.
The raw sugar cane from the cane yard is conveyed to the milling station on the main
carrier. Before milling, the cane is first evened in the kicker, cut down to smaller pieces
by a series of rotating cutting knives, and then chopped further in the fibrizer, which
shreds the cane and exposes the sugar containing cells. Kakira does not prewash the
raw cane prior to juice extraction.

MILLING
At the milling station, the cane passes through a series of rollers that crush the cane and
extract the juice. Maceration or imbibition water (equal to 20-40% of the cane weight
passing through the mill) is added to the crushed cane prior to the final crushing mill to
assist in extracting the cane juice. The juice flows through the machinery to a metal
trough below the floor and is pumped to a receiving tank. The bagasse (waste sugar
cane material) is conveyed to the boiler furnaces for buming.
The objective is to optimize the milling operation via maximum cane preparation,
maximum juice drainage, good mill setting and continuous even grinding rate.
CLARIFYING
From the receiving tank, batches of cane juice are pumped to the primary juice heater
where it is heated to about 65 to 70°C. The heated cane juice is then pumped to a
reaction tank where a lime solution is added to prevent sucrose inversion by increasing
the pH from 5.2 to 7.8. The lime solution is formed by adding powdered lime (calcium
oxide) and water in the lime slaker.
From the reaction tank, the cane juices are heated in the secondary heaters to 100
tol 050C and are then pumped to a clarifier where the solids are allowed to settle out.
The clarifier mud is collected and transported to the filters, where bagacillo (fine bagasse
particles) are used as a filter medium to extract the remaining filtrate from the clarifier
mud. The clarifier is cleaned out every two weeks. The remaining sludge is spread on
the ground adjacent to the water treatment plant. The filter cake (dried clarifier mud)
from the filters is transported to the sugar cane fields for use as a soil amendment and
the filtrate is recycled back into the cane juice process. A total of 24 000 tonnes (3.77%
of cane crushed) of filter cake is produced.
EVAPORA TING
The clear juice from the clarifier is pumped to multiple effect evaporators where it is
concentrated from about 85% water to 30-40% water. The concentrated juice is now
called syrup and is pumped to the sulphitor where sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas is bubbled
through the syrup. The SO2 gas, created in the sulphur burner by igniting powdered
sulphur, serves three purposes:
A  it acts as a disinfectant
x  reduces the viscosity of the slurry
x  bleaches the syrup
Syrup from the evaporators is treated with sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas for bleaching
purposes. The SO2 is generated in a reaction vessel and bubbled through the syrup in
the "sulphitor" reaction tank, reducing the pH of the syrup from 6.8 to 5.5. Excess
sulphur dioxide is discharged from a tank vent to the roof. Approximately 0.3 kg of
sulphur is consumed per tonne of crushed cane. On a 2500 metric tonnes of cane
crushed per day (TCD) basis, approximately 750 kg of sulphur is used per day. The
exhausted gas discharged from the reaction vessel is estimated to have a maximum SO2
gas concentration of 0.2% of the gas used (Kakira, 2000). Therefore, the SO2 gas

discharged from the sulphitor vessel will be a maximum of 1.5 kg/day. There is no
pollution control equipment on the sulphitor vessel.
CRYSTALLIZING
After bleaching, the syrup is taken to the vacuum pans for crystallization. Molasses is
then separated from the sugar in the centrifuges. The sugar is discharged to a conveyor
that takes it to a dryer where the sugar is dehumidified to give dry sugar, weighed in 50-
kg bags, and shipped out for sale or stocked.
The molasses is piped to a 3000 m3 outdoor aboveground storage tank adjacent to the
factory and is sold directly to private customers. The molasses is dispensed from the
tank to drums in the back of customers' trucks, via an overhead hose. Molasses,
though not hazardous to handle or to ingest, is a very viscous material and has a high
biological oxygen demand (BOD). If discharged to the environment in any significant
quantity, it may have considerable environmental impact on wildlife and aquatic life. The
molasses tank is of single-walled, stainless steel construction and was observed to be in
fair condition (Wardrop, 2002). There is no secondary containment. To keep the
molasses cool, and to prevent fermentation, water is continually sprayed on the exterior
of the tank. The water spray drains to a gutter that runs along side of the tank and
eventually discharges to the ground, reportedly somewhere in the bush.
3.2.2   STEAM GENERATION
BAGASSE-FIRED BOILERS
KSW bums bagasse to generate steam to drive factory turbo-generators, mill turbines
and turbo-pumps, and for use in sugar processing in the Boiling House. Bagasse quality
(moisture and ash content) is important for boiler efficiency. Bagasse moisture in the
range of 45-48% is desirable for efficient burning. It is necessary to have a continuous
flow of bagasse to the boiler fumaces; therefore, bagasse storage and reclaim systems
that can respond to accommodate variations in plant operations are essential.
A total of 350 000 tonnes of bagasse (38.89% of cane crushed) are produced on an
annual basis. Of this, approximately 237 000 tonnes are bumed in the boilers. The
remaining 113 000 tonnes (150 loads x 3 MT = 450 MT/day) of excess bagasse are
transported to the cane fields for disposal.
Operation
Bagasse is currently used to fuel four boilers (identified as Boiler Nos. 1 - 4) in the Kakira
factory (Figure 5). Bagasse is transferred from the mill tandems to the boilers on
bagasse carriers. The bagasse is gravity-fed through chutes to the boilers where it piles
onto a refractory hearth. Primary and overfire combustion air flows through ports in the
fumace walls; buming begins on the surface pile. Fuel oil or firewood is used for boiler
start-up, or as alternative emergency sources of energy.
Boilers No. 2 and 3, installed in 1954, are the oldest boilers at KSW. Boiler No.1
(Babcock & Wilson) was installed in 1969 and Boiler No. 4 was installed in 1971. The
boiler operating parameters and steam output (in tonnes per hour) are as follows:

Boiler No. 4:                30 T/h
Total Current Steam Capacity  90 T/h
The steam requirement at the current operating level (3000 TCD) is 75 T/h, which is
supplied by operating boilers 1 and 4 with extra steam from boilers 2 and/or 3, as
required. The flue gas from the boilers is vented to the outdoors via three tall stacks.
The boilers are not equipped with any pollution control equipment. Fumace ash is
manually removed from the boilers and trucked to a disposal area or used in the field as
a soil amendment (John Payne, 1998).
Maintenance
All of the boilers have undergone various upgrades over the years. The boilers are
inspected for safe operation every 12 to 14 months as per the Uganda Factory Act
(1964).
COGENERA TION
A schematic flow diagram of the cogeneration process is provided again as Figure 6.
Boilers for cogeneration range from 20 bar to 80 bar pressure. The ratio of power to
steam generation increases with increasing pressure.
High-pressure steam is partly used to drive the Steam Turbine Drives in the sugar mill.
The balance of the high-pressure steam is fed to the turbo-generators where the steam
energy is converted to electrical energy. This electricity is used to drive equipment in the
factory, foundry, workshop, offices and residential areas. The exhaust low-pressure
steam from the turbine is then used in the sugar manufacturing process.
KSW currently has two turbogenerators:
1. Franco Tossi        3 MW rated capacity, 2.7 MW achievable output
2. Blohm and Voss      1.5 MW rated capacity, 1.2 MW achievable output
KSW also has five diesel generator sets with a combined capacity of 2500 KVA.
Currently, KSW's intemal power generation is only used for intemal needs (sugar factory
and some ancillary units). KSW purchases electricity form UEDCL to provide electricity
for its infrastructure (housing, street lighting, sweets factory and irrigation).

3.3 PROPOSED EXPANSION
Once KSW increases cogeneration, they will provide electricity for their own
infrastructure that is estimated to be in the order of 1.5 MW. This includes electric power
for pumping water for the factory and housing. The expanded sugar factory and new
cogeneration plant will consume another 4.4 MW. During off-peak hours, the total future
KSW in-house power consumption, including irrigation, is estimated to be 8.6 MW.
During peak hours, when there will be no irrigation, the estimated power requirements
are 12 to 13 MW total, with 6 to 7 MW exported to UETCL (KSW, 2002).
3.3.1   FACTORY
To facilitate an increase in production to 4000 TCD, a number of modifications and
upgrades are required within the factory at each processing stage.
PROCESSING
x  A new Cameco unloader will be used to unload cane directly onto the feeder table.
This process will be located between the mill yard and the machine shop. The
overhead crane will be extended and possibly elevated so that the crane can
discharge cane onto the feeder table. A new cane feeder table (7 m x 12 m) will be
installed to transfer cane to the main cane carrier. At night, the Cameco stacker will
feed stored cane directly to the main cane conveyor.
A  A new shredder will be installed at the same location as the existing Unigrator. The
prepared cane will drop onto a belt conveyor that will transport the prepared cane to
mill No. 1. A magnet will be mounted over the belt conveyor to remove any metal
that has passed through the shredder. This will protect the mill rolls from excessive
tooth breakages.
MILLING
x  The rake-type inter-carrier will allow maceration to be applied to its maximum
efficiency. A chute can be mounted on mill No. 2 to improve mill throughput. An
increase in extraction is expected.
x  To increase milling capacity, strained and unstrained juice pumps, water imbibition
pumps and a strainer for secondary juice will be installed.
A A second milling tandem will be added in parallel with the existing milling train to
accommodate the planned increase in cane throughput. The second milling tandem
will be electrically or steam driven to improve the energy efficiency for the
cogeneration project.
CLARIFYING
x  Additional juice pumps for treated and clear juice, juice screens, rotary vacuum filter,
vacuum pumps and milk of lime pumps will be installed to increase the capacity of
the juice treatment and clarification.

lWADROP
x  The heating surfaces of the juice heaters as well as the clear juice heater will be
increased to increase the capacity.
x  A new load cell type 250 tonne/hour juice weighing scale has been installed and was
operated during the 2002/2003 crop season. This scale replaces the former
150 tonne/hour scale, increasing the volume of juice weighed and improving the
reliability for chemical control.
x  A filtrate clarifier (designed locally) has been installed and was operated during the
2002/2003 crop season. This will reduce the load on the existing tray clarifier. A
new trayless clarifier of SRI type has been installed and commissioned in January
2003. This new clarifier will be used in lieu of the old tray type clarifier to improve
juice quality and to reduce sucrose losses through inversion. The new trayless
clarifier will have a retention time of approximately 30 minutes compared to over 2
hours for the old clarifier. The old clarifier will be left in place and be a standby unit
for emergency.
A rotary vacuum filter will be added to take care of the increase in mud loading from
the increased grinding rate. The mud flow from the mud mixer to the filters will be
automatically controlled by monitoring the mud level in the filter mud trough.
EVAPORA TING
X  The evaporator station will be converted from quadruple to quintuple effect, and will
be automated to ensure steam efficiencies are increased and steam economy is
achieved.
CRYSTALLIZING
X  A new 100 Vhr sulphur bumer was installed for the 2002/2003 crop season. This
new unit will improve the sulphitation process, thus resulting in a reduction in sulfur
consumption and S02 emissions.
x  A syrup floatation clarifier was installed to reduce the turbidity of the syrup. The
removal of suspended solids will reduce the syrup viscosity that in tum will improve
the pan boiling process.
x  To increase plant capacity, low grade Vacuum Pan #8 has been installed and
commissioned during the 2002/2003 crop season. Pan Nos. 1 and 2 have also been
modified to improve the heating surface volume ratio to improve pan boiling speed.
x  The existing cooling water pond will be extended to accommodate the additional
water to be processed as a result of the additional vacuum pans. An estimated 20%
increase in water volume is expected, although this is all recirculated.
x Belt conveyors will be installed to allow for automation of the bagging and final
conveying operations. This will improve the accuracy and control of the system.

3.3.2   CO-GENERATION
The proposed new power generation arrangement is provided as Figure 7.
A continuous flow of bagasse feed to the boilers must be established. To ensure
maximum boiler load and to off-set periods of factory stoppages due to mechanical
breakdown and reduced cane supply, it is important to have a good bagasse storage
and reclaim system. KSW therefore proposes to install additional bagasse handling
equipment including new belt type drives for bagasse carriers 1, 2 and 4. Bagasse
conveyors for the new boiler facility and the new bagasse house will be belt type. The
drag slat type recycled bagasse and feed conveyors to the existing boilers and existing
bagasse reclaim house will be retained.
KSW proposes to construct a bagasse storage/reclaim house with a one-day storage
capacity. Any excess bagasse beyond the one-day storage quantum would be
transferred to an outside storage yard (approximately 1000 T) and retrieved when
required.
With the expansion to 4000 TCD, the factory's steam requirement would increase to 95
T/h. An additional 50 T/h steam is required for the cogeneration plant. The total steam
requirement is 145 T/h. To produce the additional steam generation capacity the
following activities are proposed:
x Refurbish Boilers 2 and 3 to increase steam generation from 15 T/h to 19 T/h
l Install two low-pressure Breda boilers (50 T/h at 20 bar) currently available at Kakira.
Proposed steam capacity:
Boiler No. 1           30 T/h
Boiler No. 2           19 T/h
Boiler No. 3           19 T/h
Boiler No. 4           30 T/h
Breda Boiler No. 1     50 T/h
Breda Boiler No. 2     50 T/h
Total Steam Capacity  198 T/h
KSW proposes to add a new 14-15 MW Extraction-condensing turbo-generator. With
this type of turbine, only the quantity of steam required for the process is extracted at
1 bar. The balance of the steam continues to flow through the turbine to generate more
electric power. The exhaust steam is transferred to the condenser unit from the turbine
and the condensed water obtained from this steam is recycled as boiler feed-water. This
equipment would have a marginal extra capacity to produce additional power if greater
demand occurs and adequate bagasse is available.

UARDROP
The new cogeneration plant will operate in two modes during the 305-day crushing
season (mid-June to mid-April):
x  Off-peak Hours (18 hours per day)
0 210 days, 8.6 MW required for infrastructure, factory, cogeneration plant and
irrigation
w  95 days, 5.9 MW required for infrastructure, factory, and the cogeneration plant,
without irrigation
X  Peak Hours (6 hours per day)
Boiler steam output will be increased to generate 12 to 13 MW, 6 to 7 MW of
electric power to be sold to UETCL.
During the off-season, stored excess bagasse will be used to generate 2.5 MW of power
for intemal use only.
Installations of piping, cabling, electrical equipment, instrumentation and control systems
are necessary civil works. The entire operation of the factory as well as the turbine and
condenser system will be operated through an integrated Distributed Control System
from a central control room.
The proposed cogeneration plant will consist of two Breda boilers in addition to the four
existing boilers. The Breda boilers are equipped with a dry ash collection system. The
remaining fly ash will be scrubbed through a full wet scrubber. The fly ash will be sent to
a clarifier where grit will be separated and mixed with the filter cake for disposal to the
cane field. The water from the clarifier will be sent to a retention pond and then
eventually overflow to the Kiko stream.
ELECTRICAL SUB-STATION AT KAKIRA
KSW will construct a new 10 MVA electrical substation at Kakira. The substation will be
constructed with one 10 MVA 33 kV transformer. The new substation will require a
fenced area of approximately 900 m2 (30 m x 30 m). The substation will be located
adjacent to the foundry and, as a result, its construction and operations will not affect
any vegetation, animal habitat or human settlements. The details of the electrical
installations required will be determined after detailed design of the project, but will likely
include synchronization to the grid scheme, grounding and grid isolation. A small
concrete building will be required to house the metering instruments. Typically this will
be locked and only be opened by the Utility company to obtain the monthly meter
reading.
33Kv DISTRIBUTION LINE
KSW will install a new distribution line to connect the new Kakira sub-station to the
Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL) Jinja Industrial Substation at
Mailombili. This line comprises:

IAR   OP
x  An overhead uninsulated All-Aluminum Alloy Conductor (AAAC) line from Kakira to
Wairaka / Bugembe. The total length of this line is approximately 10 km, and it is
proposed to be constructed on land owned by KSW.
x  An underground 3-core XLP insulated cable laid on the existing 10 m wide UEDCL
Right of Way (ROW) from Wairaka to Mailombili. The total length of this portion of
the distribution line is approximately 4 km.
Given the risk of theft of non-electrified cables, KSW will start constructing the proposed
line only 3-6 months prior to commissioning of the new cogeneration plant that is
scheduled for June 2005. It would hence be appropriate to carry out the New Distribution
Line route shortly before the construction of the line to ensure that the most current
situation on the ground is assessed.
An environmental assessment of the transmission line will be conducted at a later date.
No construction on the transmission line will occur until the assessment, including a
resettlement plan, if required, has been cleared and disclosed by the World Bank.

3.5 SCHEDULE
KSW proposes to complete and commission the project by June 2005. KSW estimates
that 1.07 million tonnes of cane will be available in 2004-2005, which equates to enough
bagasse to generate at least 5 MW during peak hours. In 2005-2006, 1.12 million
tonnes of cane will be available, which will provide enough bagasse to generate at least
6 MW during peak hours.
The final schedule will be determined upon completion of detailed project design.
3.6 STAFFING AND SUPPORT FACILITIES
The facility will require an additional 60 people for the operations. However, following
restructuring and automation of some of the processes after the expansion of the sugar
factory, these staff will be relocated to the cogeneration facility from other factory
processes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the project will result in employing more people.
3.7 OFF-SITE INVESTMENTS
No additional off-site investments will be required as a result of this project.
3.8 LIFE-SPAN AND EXPECTED FUTURE GROWTH
At present, KSW is not planning to export more than the 6 to 7 MW of power currently
proposed. However, the system as proposed would accommodate an increase in
generation of up to 9 to 10 MW without significant additional capital investment.

4.0        BASELINE DATA
4.1     ENVIRONMENTAL OVERVIEW
4.1. 1  SITE DESCRIPTION
The Kakira property covers about 22,500 acres (9000 hectares) of land, 19,000 acres of
which are used for sugar cane cultivation. The remainder of the property is occupied by
manufacturing operations, namely a sugar processing and packaging factory, a sweets
factory and a soap and oil factory. Supporting infrastructure including administrative
buildings, an airstrip, living quarters, schools, hospital, stores and a 500 km road
network, is also present.
4.1.2   LAND USE
Kakira Sugar Works neighbours with Polota Trading centre to the west, and with Lake
Victoria to the south (Figure 8). To the north it is adjacent to Butamira Forest reserve
and traversed by River Chico and to the east is Magamaga trading centre, Magamaga
- barracks and hill ranges. The terrain of the area is generally flat with undulating hilltops
that are generally spread all over the entire plantation estate.
4.2     PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.2.1   LOCATION / SETTING
Lake Victoria borders the property to the south, and agricultural land to the north, east
and west. The community of Polota, Mwiri Hill, and a swamp area known as Mutai forest
swamp, are also located to the west.
The surface topography in the Kakira area comprises relatively flat terrain with hilly
areas surrounding the property boundary. The estate is on a generally undulating plain.
Slopes are between 2 to 12% with the steepest land on the midslopes. The general
surface slopes from 1200 m in the south near Lake Victoria to 1150 m in the north.
Small prominent hills with slopes up to 30% are interspersed on the plain. The relative
relief of the plain is 40 to 60 m.
4.2.2   DRAINAGE
The factory is located on a slope with the cane yard at the highest elevation and the
process and boiler areas on the lowest end of the site. There are two principal drains at
the site. The first drain is a storm water and factory drain located on west side of the
sugar store, the process house outflow joins this. The second drain services the cane
yard area and powerhouse. The two systems combine into a single drain just below the

spray pond and join Mugala Stream, a natural water drainage system. Currently, all
wastewater is discharged untreated into the Kiko River via the Mugala Stream.
4.3      BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.3.1    CLIMATE
The climate in the region is described as tropical. Altitude (1157 m) and Lake Victora
moderate temperatures, with an annual average maximum of 280C and a minimum of
1 8°C. The Jinja District has two dry seasons (December to March and June to August)
and two rainy seasons (March to May and September to December).
4.3.2    AIR QUALITY
As part of an atmospheric sampling program to determine temporal and spatial trends of
pesticides in air and precipitation in the Northem Lake Victoria watershed, a sampling
site was established at Kakira in November 1999. Results collected from November
1999 to March 2000 reveal the presence of chlorinated compounds such as DDT and its
insecticidally active isomers, Dieldrin, lindane (g-HCH), chlordane, and heptachlor.
Preliminary analyses of the data indicate that the presence of these compounds are
likely due to regional depositions rather than local use. Analysis to determine the
presence of other compounds is underway.
(http://Www.lvemp.org/L Publications/Uaanda/newsletter"/o2Oiun%202002.htm).
KSW does not use any insecticides for cane cultivation. Air emission sources and
pollutants generated by Kakira operations are summarized in Table 4.

BOILER EMISSION RATE ESTIMATES
The most significant pollutant emitted by bagasse-fired boilers is particulate matter,
caused by the turbulent movement of combustion gases with respect to the burning
bagasse and resultant ash.
Under normal operating conditions, the significant product of combustion of the bagasse
is carbon dioxide (CO2), with lesser amounts of nitrogen oxides (NO,) and negligible
quantities of polycyclic organic matter. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the boilers
are also considered negligible, owing to the characteristically low levels of sulfur
associated with bagasse.
Pollutant emission rates from the boilers under future operating conditions, where the
bagasse feed rate will be increased by 100%, are summarized in Table 5. The emission
rates were calculated based on emission factors from the US EPA Publication AP-42,
5th Edition, Volume 1 Chapter 1.8 Bagasse Combustion in Sugar Mills (US EPA, 1996)
(Appendix B). The emission rates that have been calculated assume normal boiler
operabon and a bagasse moisture content of approximately 50% by weight.

There are no Ugandan emission standards to which to compare the above estimated
rates.
Note that the boilers use old technology and as such the existing combustion conditions
may result in significant emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), unbumed organics (VOCs)
and total organic compounds (TOCs). These have not been estimated because
emission factors for these parameters are not available.
A screening level assessment of air emissions from the three bagasse boiler stacks was
conducted using the US EPA SCREEN3 model. The model input parameters, sample
calculations and dispersion modelling results are provided in Appendix B.

The SCREEN3 model results are given as ground level concentrations using a 1-hour
averaging time. The 1-hour concentrations were converted to 8-hour and 24-hour
averaging times by multiplying US EPA factors. The modelling results expressed in
terms of 1 hour, 8 hour and 24-hour averaging times are summarised in Appendix B.
The 24-hour ground level pollutant concentrations are presented as a function of
distance from the source in Appendix B.
Carbon Dioxide
The dispersion modelling results indicate that the 24-hour maximum concentrations of
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides and nitrogen dioxide, when the operations are increased
by 100%, are 130 000 ptg/M3, 100 pg/M3 and 70 pg/M3 respectively. This would occur at
183 m from the source.
Carbon dioxide emissions contribute to the global warming effect. Uganda has not
committed to any intemational protocols for greenhouse gas reductions (e.g. Kyoto
protocol).
Nitrogen Oxides
The dispersion modelling results indicate that the 24-hour maximum concentrations of
nitrous oxides and nitrogen dioxide will be 100 p,g/M3 and 70 pg/M3 respectively,
occurring 183 m from the source, when facility operations are increased by 100%.
Nitrous oxides and nitrogen dioxides are precursors of acid rain, which affects forests
and vegetation. Our results indicate acceptable levels of these pollutants compared to
Uganda and international guidelines.
Other sources of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides (including nitrogen dioxide), not
included in the above, are: diesel generators, foundry fumaces, cane and bagasse
buming in the fields, and wood firing of the boilers during start up.
Boiler Particulate Emissions
The dispersion modelling results indicate that the 24-hour maximum concentrations of
particulates would be 2,600 1pg/M3, occurring 183 m from the source.
Comparing the particulate results to the 24-hour ambient standard of 300 pg/M3
published in the Proposed Environmental Air Quality Standards for Uganda (February
2002), we find that particulate concentrations may exceed this value for up to 10 km
from the stack base. As shown in Appendix B, these concentrations also exceed other
intemational standards (e.g. US NAAQS 100 pg/M3; Equador 80 pLg/M3).
Pollutant concentrations decrease as one moves away from the source. At the closest
Kakira property line (650 m from the source), 24-hour ground level concentrations of
particulate are 870 pg/M3. Thus Kakira employees and the public, or anyone who lives
within a 10 km radius of the factory may experience health effects from particulates from
the boilers. Please note that these concentrations are based on conservative
assumptions and literature values and represent a 'worst-case" scenario. The actual

concentrations may be much lower. As evidence to this, the Kakira hospital has not
received any related health complaints in the past.
Those communities further away may not experience health effects. It is noted that
communities such as the one on top of Mwiri hill (157 m above the factory level), may
experience concentrations almost double those at ground level, due to the impact of the
hill on plume behaviour.
Although the SCREEN3 model incorporates many conservative assumptions, these are
estimated results employing emission factors that assume normal boiler operation.
These results do not account for operational upsets as may occur at Kakira given that
the boilers use older technology.
There are a number of combustion sources that emit particulate matter at Kakira that
have not been estimated quantitatively. These include the diesel generators, foundry
fumaces, and emissions during boiler start-up using wood. Their sources are considered
minor, in comparison to boiler emissions.
Fugitive Dust
There are a number of significant sources of fugitive dust emissions from Kakira. These
include other fugitive sources such as trucks driving on unpaved roads, outdoor
conveyors or chutes, or from holes in galvanized pipes that convey bagasse or bagacillo,
and storage piles.
Sulphur Dioxide
Syrup from the evaporators is treated with sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas for bleaching
purposes. The S02 is generated in a reaction vessel and bubbled through the syrup in
the 'sulphitor" reaction tank, reducing the pH of the syrup from 6.8 to 5.5. Excess
sulphur dioxide is discharged from a tank vent to the roof. Approximately 0.3 kg of
sulphur is consumed per tonne of crushed cane. On a 2500 TCD basis, approximately
750 kg of sulphur is used per day. The exhausted gas discharged from the reaction
vessel is estimated to have a maximum SO2 gas concentration of 0.2% of the gas used.
Therefore the SO2 gas discharged from the sulphitor vessel will be a maximum of 1.5
kg/day. There is no pollution control equipment on the sulphitor vessel.
Combustion sources such as diesel generators and wood fired boilers (start-up) will emit
additional amounts of sulphur dioxide.
4.3.3   NOISE
KSW has been monitoring noise levels within and around the sugar factory including the
existing cogeneration system. Results obtained from the monitoring exercise on a
bimonthly basis from December 2002 to February 2003 by the SHE division of KSW are
indicated in Table 6. Except for a few locations like the electrical workshop, the offices
and laboratories, the noise levels are higher than the World Bank noise standards for
cane mills.

The noise monitoring was targeted at areas that receive hissing noise from steam and
operations of the cogeneration area. It is expected that noise generated from the new
boilers of the proposed project will be lower and in general the project will result in less
noise levels from the cogeneration project.
4.3.4   BEDROCK AND SURFICIAL GEOLOGY
The Jinja District is underlain by Precambrian bedrock. Kakira falls within the Buganda-
Toro system which is characterized by partly granitized and metamorphosed formations
comprising Argillite and basal quartzite and amphibolies (NEMA, 1996).

4.3.5   SOILS
The regional stratigraphy of this part of Uganda generally comprises Nitisolic (Ferrisolic)
soils comprising primarily porous, red clay. NEMA rates this type of soil as the most
fertile and productive soil in Uganda. Based on a borehole log obtained from DWD,
these clay soils overly a sand unit that is underlain by a 27 m thick rubble zone
(Wardrop, 2003). The bedrock, comprising Phyllite, is encountered at approximately 90
m below grade.
x  Valley bottoms - moderately drained and imperfectly drained soils dominated by
heavy gleyed or mottled clays, developed on recent alluvial deposits
a Cultivated soils - mainly occurs on rhodic ferralsols
4.3.6   HYDROGEOLOGY
The Jinja area is considered to have low groundwater potential because of the fine-
grained overburden and the resulting decrease in surface water infiltration. The
borehole log obtained from the Kakira area indicates water tables at a depth of 51 m
(overburden) and 69 m (bedrock) below grade; however, given the clay soil conditions,
perched shallow water tables are suspected.
4.3.7   HYDROLOGY
The southem extent of the Kakira property is approximately 500 m north of Fielding Bay
of Lake Victoria. Chico (also referred to as Kiko), and Muwala (referred to as Mugala in
Kakira's Waste Discharge Permit Application) rivers both flow through the property
(Figure 1). Water from Lake Victoria is used for irrigation purposes at Kakira.
CHICO RIVER TRIBUTARY (MUWALA STREAM)
The Muwala Stream is used as a source of drinking water. Sampling conducted as part
of an environmental audit in 2002 indicates that this stream, except for the
bacteriological quality, meets the drinking water standards. Relatively high values of
total coliforms (1,700 no./100ml), faecal coliforms (573 no./100ml) and faecal
streptococci (2,060 no./ 00ml) imply faecal pollution of this stream. Based on the faecal
coliform and faecal streptococci ratio (0.28 < 0.4), the likely source of this pollution is
animal wastes and stormwater. In addition, during sampling, a man was observed
bathing in the stream, while a woman was washing clothes in the streams' waters.
Therefore microbiological contamination may also be caused from these activities. This
is a cause for concern in view of the fact that most likely the communities residing
adjacent to this stream use these waters for domestic purposes including drinking water.

4.4      BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.4.1    TERRESTRIAL HABITAT
The Kakira estate falls into Albizzia chlorophora, semi-deciduous forest vegetation zone.
However, the lands in the vicinity of the Kakira estate were cleared for agricultural
production almost a century ago leaving only small remnants of relatively natural
woodlands with limited ecological function or value and virtually no linkages with other
biological features.
During the August 2000 site visit, several Forest Reserves were inspected, including
Butamira, Masiga, Namazingiri, and Namafuma. All have been essentially cleared years
ago, and now consist of plantations dominated by eucalyptus and/or pine. All Forest
Reserves examined in August have areas that are or have been inter-planted with food
crops. While this practice serves a social good, it contributes nothing to the ecological
value of the forest features.
AGRICUL TURE
The Jinja District has a high potential for agriculture due to favourable soils and weather
conditions. The main crops cultivated include maize, beans, groundnuts, coffee,

bananas, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, vegetables and fruits (NEMA, 1996). Crops are
grown on both a subsistence and commercial level.
WOODLANDS
A small forested area is located within the Chico division of the Kakira property, while
developed woodlands follow the main loose-surfaced all weather roads running north
and west from the sugar factory.
Butamira Forest Reserve
The Butamira Forest Reserve is located in Buyengo sub-county, Jinja District, and it is
situated immediately north of the main KSW estate. It is approximately 14 km2 in size.
Prior to 1930, it was a natural forest owned by the Busoga Local Government. In 1930,
it was gazetted as a Local Forest Reserve, and in 1949, it was leased by the
Govemment to Muljibhai Madhvani & Company Limited (MMCL) for a period of 49 years.
The terms of the lease required MMCL to clear the natural forest and to replant the lands
with eucalyptus at a rate of 400 acres each year for the first 7 years. The eucalyptus
trees were subsequently used as a source of fuel for the KSW sugar factory.
The conditions of the permit include, among other items, the preservation of uncultivated
strips of land along the streams and rivers in the Reserve to protect against silting and
protection of hilltops against erosion and land degradation.
With the expulsion of the Asian community from Uganda in 1971/1972, along with other
properties of the Madhvani Group, a widespread deforestation of the Butamira Area
occured. In 1985, when the present management re-possessed the Kakira Sugar
Complex (now operated under the name of Kakria Sugar Works (1985) Ltd.), it also took
charge of the Butamira Area for rehabilitation and development.
As of a August 2000 site visit by Wardrop, more than 700 ha of the Forest Reserve were
"cleared" or "under stump", virtually all of which will be planted with cane before the end
of 2003.
The NEMA has also reviewed KSW's development plans and has agreed that growing of
sugarcane will not have any negative impact of the local environment. Subsequently,
Permit No. 00015 dated July 5, 2002, was issued to KSW for cane cultivation in the
Butamira Area. A copy of this permit is provided in Appendix C.
WETLANDS
There are virtually no wetlands within the nucleus KSW estate. If any existed before
establishment of the sugar-production facility, they have long since been displaced by
cane field. As such, wetlands are not an issue on the main KSW lands.

FISH
The district's main water bodies, Lake Victoria and River Nile are habitat for a variety of
wildlife, of which fish is major. Lake Victoria supports high diversity of fish species. The
non-cichlids alone numbered about 50. Of these about 10 are commercially important.
These included Bagrus docmac (Semutundu), Claria gariepinus, Protopterius
gethiopicus (Mamba), Labeo victorianus (Ningu), Synodontis afrofischeri (Nkolongo),
Barbus alrianalio (Kisinja), Mormyrus kannume (Nzere). These species are important
locally.
Other species present in the water bodies of the district include:
B. docmac, P. aethiopicus, C. gariepinus, Clarias liocephalus, S. agrofichari, M.

ENDANGERED AND PROTECTED SPECIES
There are no endangered species within the project area. Wetland and forested areas
are considered as protected habitat in Uganda; however, these types of habitats do not
fall within the project area.
4.5     SOCIO-CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
The KSW facility, which directly occupies about 9000 hectares of land, now employs
over 6,000 workers. In addition, there are about 3,600 "outgrowers", with individual land
holdings ranging from about 2 hectares to several hundred hectares (average of 2.5
hectares), which also supply cane under contract to the KSW mill. All outgrowers are
located within a 25 km radius of the plant, which has a present sugar-cane crushing
capacity of about 3000 tonnes per day (TCD).
4.5.1   LAND AND RESOURCE USE
The land in the area is mainly used for cane cultivation.
4.5.2   DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AREA
The social organization of the area is based on the kinship system, patrilineal line
Women in the area account for an important proportion of the labour force required.
Majority of residents belong to the poor peasant category who own small land parcels
(one or two acres).
4.5.3   ECONOMIC CONDITION
KSW has seen a steady growth of employment since 1985. Currently 6,500 people work
within the estate, with 600 in the factory and the rest in agriculture and administration,
including personnel, schools, hospitals, financing and security, etc. Infrastructure
expenditures include housing, roads, transport, electric supply, water treatment and
distribution, communication, hospital, education
Commercialization of the various crops is having a positive impact on residents (cash for
crops).
4.5.4   INFRASTRUCTURE
UTILITIES
Approximately 85% of the power at the Kakira property is supplied by the on-site
cogeneration operations. The Uganda ElectricityDistribution Company Ltd. (UEDCL)
supplies the remaining 15%.
KSW has invested capital in infrastructure such as housing for employees, roads,
transportation, electricity supply, water treatment, modem communications, and hospital
and schools.

5.0 SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND
SOCIAL IMPACTS
An interaction matrix identifying and assessing the interactions of project activities with
environmental and socioeconomic components is presented in Table 8. Project
activities with interactions on environmental components that could lead to potential
environment effects were denoted with a closed circle in the matrix.
5.1     BIOPHYSICAL EFFECTS
Descriptions and assessments of the identified potential environmental effects of the
proposed project are provided in the following sections. Summaries of the results of the
assessment are provided in Table 9. The results of the residual effects assessment are
detailed in Table 10.
5.1.1   AIR QUALITY, CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY
INCREASED NOISE GENERATION DUE TO CONSTRUCTION OF EXPANDED
COGENERATION FACILITY
Expansion activities are expected to occur over a ten-month period. These activities will
increase ambient noise levels, resulting in decreased air quality, or noise pollution.
Ambient noise levels surrounding the Kakira site are within the 85-dB guideline value
(based on noise monitoring values with the factory compound front and rear). The
closest residential housing is located approximately 1000 m from the factory.
A number of types of equipment will be used on-site during expansion activities,
including trucks, bulldozers, graders, front-end loaders, pneumatic drills, and dump
trucks. Noise levels may increase up to 130 dB due to the use of heavy equipment
(NCLHH, 1999). Estimates of typical noise emissions from vehicles and equipment
expected to be used during this project are provided in Table 1 la.
The World Health Organization has published methodology to estimate cumulative noise
levels as sound pressure (dBA) (WHO, 1995). Noise levels as sound pressure, dBA,
differs from sound strength measured as decibels (dB), which is a measure of sound
amplitude. dBA, takes into account the varying sensitivity of human hearing or sound at
different frequencies (Saflex Acoustical Guide, 2000). Sound pressure levels are not
additive; the mean square of the pressures are added and then reconverted to sound-
pressure-level values. If there are any differences in the sound levels from two sources,
the combined level will exceed the higher of the two levels, but always by less than 3
dBA (Table 11 b).

VRDROP
Potential Consequence
The estimated cumulative noise emission levels during construction activities may
increase by as much as 45 dBA over ambient levels for heavy traffic areas (Table 11 c).
This increase is considered a 'worst case" scenario because it assumes all equipment
will be used at the same time. Construction activities are generally limited to within the
Kakira compound, where elevated noise levels due to factory operations, traffic, and
business operations are common. Because increased noise levels can impact human
health, mitigation is required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease noise:
x Noise levels will be monitored during construction and further noise restrictions such
as limiting the number of equipment operating simultaneously, where the noise level
exceeds ambient levels of 70 dB by more than 20 dB.
Equipment and vehicles will not be left idling for longer than 10 minutes at a time.
x Provide hearing protection to staff.
x Isolation of noise sources
x Clear waming signs indicating high level noise areas and emphasis of noise
protection equipment in those areas
Consequence of Residual Effect
Factory expansion is a short-term activity. Noise emissions will decrease by
approximately 10 dBA with mitigation, total noise increases are estimated to be about
120 dBA at the source, or 35 dBA above ambient levels. Daily noise monitoring will
allow corrective measures to be applied. The residual effect of noise disturbance during
demolition will be of low consequence.
INCREASED NOISE GENERATION DUE TO OPERATION OF EXPANDED COGENERATION
FACILITY
The expanded cogeneration facility will be in operation indefinitely. Due to the addition
of two boilers and one turbogenerators, as well as the associated infrastructure,
additional noise will be produced, potentially resulting in decreased air quality, or noise
pollution. Ambient noise levels surrounding the Kakira site are approximately 85 dB.
The closest residential housing is located 1000 m from the factory.
Potential Consequence
Based on the addition of two boilers and one turbogenerator, the cumulative noise
emission levels during operation of the expanded cogeneration facility may increase by
as much as 10 dBA over current levels in those areas of the factory (Tables 11 d). This
increase is considered a "worst case" scenario because it assumes that the new
equipment will release the same amount of noise as all of the equipment in use during
the 2002/2003 noise monitoring events. Increased noise as a result of infrastructure
than the generators and boilers has not been included in this assessment. Because
increased noise levels can impact human health, mitigation is required.

WARDROP
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease noise:
x  Noise levels will be monitored semi-monthly. Monitoring events will be conducted
during operation of the boilers and turbogenerator. Noise restrictions such as
limiting the number of equipment operating simultaneously, where the noise level
exceeds ambient levels of 70 dB by more than 20 dB, will be implemented, if
possible.
x If off-site noise levels are greater than 70 dBA for extended periods of time, Kakira
will investigate the Installation of sound baniers such as trees or earth berms to
reduce off-site noise levels.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Noise monitoring will allow corrective measures to be applied. The residual effect of
noise disturbance during operation will be of low consequence.
DECREASED AIR QUALITY FROM FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS DURING CONSTRUCTION
Gaseous and particulate air emissions released from vehicles and equipment used
during construction and operation will increase carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide
(CO), methane (CH4), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen oxides (NO,),
sulfur oxides (SO,), VOCs, and ground level ozone levels. Increased fossil fuel
emissions may decrease local air quality.
Types of equipment with petroleum-fuelled engines that will likely be used during
construction include trucks, front-end loaders, dump trucks and light equipment. For the
purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that approximately two pieces of each type
of equipment and five vehicles will be used and the bulk of construction will take
approximately 1.5 years.
Total estimated emissions for the proposed project were calculated using the
relationship between fuel consumption and exhaust gas production. The estimated fuel
consumption during construction, as well as the estimated emissions during construction
for various types of vehicles and machinery, is provided in Tables 12 a and b,
respectively. The use of equipment during construction will increase emission values
only slightly from current levels; therefore, construction will not likely result in direct air
quality problems or indirect effects on the health of valued environmental components or
human health.
Substances that deplete ozone and contribute to global warming and acid rain can be
major components of air emissions. Compounds related to global warming (CO2, CH4,
and N20) and compounds related to acid rain (NOx and SOx) are anticipated. The total
estimated greenhouse gas emissions for the project are summarized in Tables 12 c.

Potential Consequence
It is unlikely that air quality will be affected by fossil fuel emissions generated during
project activities. Although carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur
oxides, methane, VOCs, and ground ozone levels may be slightly affected locally during
times of construction using diesel or gas powered equipment, the changes in air quality
due to project activities are expected to be minor.
Although the potential emissions produced during construction activities are low, there is
a continual effort to decrease worldly emissions; therefore, mitigation is required in the
project study area.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to reduce emissions from vehicle and
equipment use:
x  Kakira will ensure that vehicles and equipment are inspected and maintained. A
poorly maintained engine and under-inflated tires can increase fuel consumption by
up to 10% and 4 to 8%, respectively.
l Vehicles and equipment will not be left idling when not in use.
x No ozone depleting substances will be used or generated from equipment during
construction.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Ensuring a high standard of inspection, maintenance, and operational practices is an
effective method of controlling excess emissions. This will reduce the magnitude and
probability of gaseous and particulate emissions from vehicle and equipment use to an
acceptable level. The residual effect of decreased air quality due to fossil fuel emissions
was evaluated to be of low consequence in the project study area.
REDUCED AIR QUALITY INCREASED AIR EMISSIONS DURING OPERATION OF
EXPANDED COGENERATION FACILITY
The air emission sources and pollutants generated by Kakira operations are summarized
in Table 4. The most significant pollutant emitted by bagasse-fired boilers is particulate
matter, caused by the turbulent movement of combustion gases with respect to the
buming bagasse and resultant ash.
Under normal operating conditions, the significant product of combustion of the bagasse
is carbon dioxide (CO2), with lesser amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and negligible
quantities of polycyclic organic matter. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the boilers
are also considered negligible, owing to the characteristically low levels of sulfur
associated with bagasse.
The Madhvani Group                       65                          0385240100-REP-VO001-02
Kakira Sugar Works Cogeneration Expansion Environmental Assessmnent



ARDROP
Dispersion modelling results for future conditions (a 100% increase in the bagasse feed
rate to the boilers) indicate the following maximum 24-hour concentrations could occur at
183 m from the source:
X  Carbon Dioxide - 130 000 _g/r3 - Carbon dioxide emissions contribute to the global
warming effect. Uganda has not committed to any intemational protocols for
greenhouse gas reductions (e.g. Kyoto protocol).
x  Nitrous Oxides and Nitrogen Dioxide - 100 pg/M3 and 70 11g/M3, respectively- Nitrous
oxides and nitrogen dioxides are precursors of acid rain, which affects forests and
vegetation. Current concentrations fall within acceptable levels of these pollutants
compared to Uganda and intemational guidelines.
X  Total Particulate Matter - 2600 pg/M3 - At the closest Kakira property line (650 m
from the source), the 24-hour ground level concentration of particulates could reach
870 j1g/M3, and the concentration does not drop below the Uganda AQS Standard
(300mg/m3) for more than 10 km away from the stack. Thus Kakira employees and
members of the public living within a radius of 10 km from the factory may
experience health effects from particulate from the boilers. Communities further
away will most likely not experience health effects associated with particulate
emissions. It should be noted that communities such as the one on top of Mwiri hill
(157 m above the factory level), may experience concentrations almost double to
those at ground level, due to the impact of the hill on plume behaviour. However,
Kakira Hospital has no recorded case or complaints of this effect.
Other emissions include:
X Fugitive Dust Emissions - There are a number of significant sources of fugitive dust
emissions from Kakira. These include other fugitive sources such as trucks driving
on unpaved roads, outdoor conveyors or chutes, or from holes in galvanized pipes
that convey bagasse or bagacillo, and storage piles.
x  Sulphur Dioxide - Syrup from the evaporators is treated with sulphur dioxide (SO2)
gas for bleaching purposes. The SO2 is generated in a reaction vessel and bubbled
through the syrup in the 'sulphitor" reaction tank, reducing the pH of the syrup from
6.8 to 5.5. Excess sulphur dioxide is discharged from a tank vent to the roof.
Approximately 0.3 kg of sulphur is consumed per tonne of crushed cane. On a 2500
metric tonnes of cane crushed per day (TCD) basis, approximately 750 kg of sulphur
is used per day. The exhausted gas discharged from the reaction vessel is
estimated to have a maximum SO2 gas concentration of 0.2% of the gas used.
Therefore the S02 gas discharged from the sulphitor vessel will be a maximum of 1.5
kg/day. There is no pollution control equipment on the sulphitor vessel. Combustion
sources such as diesel generators and wood fired boilers (start -up) will emit
additional amounts of sulphur dioxide. Kakira installed a new 100 tVhr sulphur bumer
which includes a scrubber during the 2002/2003 crop season. This new unit will
improve the sulphitation process, thus resulting in a reduction in sulphur
consumption and overall SO2 emissions.

ARDROP
Under the expanded operations, these concentrations can double, based on a doubling
of production and no additional emission controls. Air emissions assessment and
dispersion modelling are provided in Appendix B. The maximum pollutant
concentrations are found at 183 m from the source.
Potential Consequence
With the expanded operations, air quality will be adversely affected as air emissions will
approximately double. Mitigation is required to reduce the potential impacts.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease emissions during operation
of the expanded facility:
* The boilers will be equipped with a dry ash collection system and a full wet scrubber
to reduce the amount of ash released into the environment. A properly chosen,
sized and maintained wet scrubber should remove greater that 90% of the
particulate emissions from the bagasse boilers (US EPA, 1996). If this removal is
applied to the calculated air dispersion results provided in Appendix B, the maximum
24-hour concentration of particulates that could escape into the surrounding
environment would be 260 pLg/M3. This is less than the maximum Uganda AQS
Standard (300 pLg/rn3).
*  Install a process control system to eliminate excess SO2.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Air emissions are one of the major environmental outputs at Kakira. Emissions are
released throughout the sugar manufacturing process and will be released during
cogeneration activities. Following implementation of measures to control air emissions,
the probability that air emissions will be in excess of guideline values will be reduced.
Follow up monitoring may be required to determine actual concentrations of
contaminants emitted from the expanded facility. As Kakira has committed to installing
pollution control devices and has already changed the sulphitation process resulting in a
reduction in sulphur released to the atmosphere, the resultant residual effect after
implementation of mitigation was evaluated to be of low significance.
REDUCED AIR QUALITY DUE TO DUST GENERATION DURING BAGASSE HANDLING,
STORAGE AND DISPOSAL
Disposal and storage of bagasse is an on-going challenge for Kakira. Excess bagasse,
or bagasse that is too wet for buming, is stored in a covered storage area near the
boilers. Currently, approximately 450 tons of bagasse is transported in uncovered trucks
daily to the sugar cane fields for buming. While not a hazardous material, bagasse
creates nuisance dust and is thus damaging to the environment. Bagasse buming also
creates nuisance conditions for surrounding communities. Stockpiles of damp bagasse
create ideal conditions for growth of toxic moulds that can be a health hazard for
employees.

1AMROP
Potential Consequence
With the installation of the new Breda boilers and expansion of the bagasse handling
area, the excess bagasse problem will be reduced. However, management of the
bagasse to ensure a steady supply to the boilers will be critical. Mitigation is required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease dust generation dunng
bagasse handling, storage and disposal:
A  Kakira will develop a bagasse handling management plan to manage bagasse
supply and demand to the boilers and to ensure bagasse quality is maintained
during storage.
A  Repair leakages in bagasse and bagacillo chutes to reduce dust releases.
A  Cover trucked materials during transport.
A  Provide Personal Protective Equipment and training to personnel working directly
with dust-generating materials.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Dust generation during cane and bagasse handling and storage cannot be avoided
completely; however, it can be minimized via the implementation of mitigation measures.
Where unavoidable, Kakira will supply workers with appropriate personal protective
equipment and will train them in its proper use. The residual effect after mitigation was
evaluated to be insignificant.
5.1.2   SOIL QUALITY
REDUCED SOIL QUALITY DUE TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SPILLS
A summary of non-hazardous solid wastes generated at Kakira, and disposal practices,
is provided as Table 3. Kakira recycles or reuses a number of waste products.
Wastes that are considered hazardous in Uganda are defined as those that are listed in
the fifth schedule of the National Environment (Waste Management) Regulations (1999).
Hazardous materials include substances, if released, may pose risks to the environment
or to the health and safety of people or wildlife. Hazardous materials used at Kakira
include the following:
X  Process Chemicals - kept in the main store where housekeeping and storage
conditions are considered adequate (Wardrop, 2003). The floor is concrete,
preventing surface contamination and most chemicals are kept on pallets, which
keeps them dry.
w Sulphur
( Lime
0 Caustic soda and washing soda
w Talocide (antibacterial spray applied in vicinity of milling equipment)
w Phosphoric acid
X Seperan/Flocculant

WARDROP
Sodium hydrosulphite
x  Fuels - petroleum storage tanks - Surficial staining was observed in at least two tank
locations (standby diesel generator tanks, concrete pad at Chico division
headquarters) and discrepancies in dip records have historically been encountered.
Kakira were not aware of any spills that have occurred. It is our understanding that
none of the tanks are cathodically protected.
2. Other Materials - Other hazardous materials used at Kakira include various types of
lubricating oils. Empty waste oil drums are primarily stored outside the main store.
Potential Consequence
A hazardous materials spill may occur from inadequate storage, fuelling activities, or as
a result of a vehicle accident. Depending on the locabon of the spill, impacts to surface
water, groundwater, and/or soil could result.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk of
decreased environmental quality due to spills of hazardous materials:
x  Kakira will develop a spill prevention plan.
x  Kakira will ensure that chemical containers are labelled and documentation
regarding safe handling or first aid measures (i.e. MSDS) are accessible from each
storage and use location.
x  Kakira will make spill clean-up equipment readily available in chemical storage
areas.
x  Kakira will ensure that chemical containers are stored in a safe fashion to reduce the
potential for containers falling over and spilling.
x  Storage of fuels and other hazardous materials will be conducted in designated
locations only
x  Work will be monitored during construction to ensure there are no releases of
deleterious substances.
Refuelling and maintenance of equipment will be conducted in designated locations
only
X Workers who handle the chemicals will be provided training in chemical safety and
adequate personal protective equipment. Occupational exposure of workers during
handling of toxic powdered chemicals such as caustic soda and sulphur, is a
particular concem. Emergency showers or eyewash stations in areas where some
chemicals are handled will be considered.

NRDROP
Consequence of Residual Effect
Following the implementation of mitigation measures, the nsk of accidental spills of
hazardous materials will be reduced. This potential effect will be of low significance.
REDUCED SOIL QUALITY DUE TO PCBs RELEASED DURING TRANSFORMER
MAINTENANCE
There are thirty-three electrical transformers on the Kakira property. UEDCL owns ten of
these and Kakira owns the rest. Kakira will be adding one additional transformer as a
result of the cogeneration project.
The transformers currently on the Kakira property were installed between 1959 to 2000.
Private contractors complete major repairs on the transformers off-site; however, Kakira
completes minor repairs on-site, including periodic filtering of the transformer oil to
remove water and dirt. The facility has a portable piece of equipment for pumping the oil
from the transformer, separating the oil and dirt and recycling the oil back to the
transformer. The typical practice is to discard small quantities of separated water onto
the ground.
PCBs are a class of chemicals, some of which are highly toxic and/or bioaccumulative.
PCBs although not highly flammable, if ignited, will generate toxic fumes containing
dioxins. PCB oils have excellent conductive properties and were therefore used
extensively in transformers and other electrical equipment. However, now that its toxicity
is well known, the use of the oils has been phased out in many parts of the world.
It is unknown whether the transformer oil contains PCB's. However, NEMA suspects
that many transformers in Uganda contain oil laced with PCB's, particularly old
transformers. There are no facilities in Uganda to analyse for PCB's. Although it is
assumed that the new transformer will be PCB-free, mitigation is required to limit the
amount of PCBs potentially being released to the environment during maintenance
activities of the existing units. For replacement of transformer oils, KSW will use PCB-
free transformer oils.
Potential Consequence
The amount of PCBs currently released to the soil environment via discarded water is
likely minimal as PCBs have a relatively low water solubility. However, due to the
potential toxic effects associated with PCBs, and because an additional transformer will
be installed, mitigation is recommended.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk of
decreased environmental quality due to the addition of PCBs to the soil:
A  Kakira will collect all water and dirt from transformers during maintenance activities
and treat as hazardous waste. These materials will be stored in an approved
location for future incineration in Europe. The estimated costs of analysis of PCBs,
transport and incineration in Europe are indicated in the following table:

Miscellaneous (permits, handling etc)  $ 2000 per shipment
Consequence of Residual Effect
After implementation of mitigation measures, this potential effect is deemed to be
insignificant.
DECREASED SOIL QUALITY DUE TO ADDITION OF METALS TO SOILS THROUGH
FILTER CAKE (MUD) AND FLY ASH SOIL AMENDMENTS
There is the potential for metals to be added to agricultural soils through the addition of
filter cake and fly ash. A total of 24 000 tonnes (3.77% of cane crushed) of filter cake is
produced annually. During a previous environmental investigation, it was determined
that the filter cake has an elevated level of copper (Wardrop 2003). It is understood that
elevated copper levels are naturally occurring and as such are not a result of the Kakira
activities. Therefore, the fly ash and filter cake classify as non-hazardous waste.
Potential Consequence
The concentrations of metals within the filter cake and fly ash are within referenced
guideline values for agricultural soils. Kakira does not add metals within their process,
therefore all of the metals contained in the fly ash are expected to be naturally occurring,
likely derived from the soil. Mitigation is not required.
REDUCED SOIL QUALITY AS A RESULT OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
Kakira currently of solid waste at an old quarry site on their property. The quantities of
waste disposed at this location are minimal currently; however, this is an unlicensed site
with no formal design. The potential for environmental effects exists.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk of
decreased environmental quality due to solid waste disposal:
A  Kakira will discontinue use of unlicensed waste disposal grounds. Only a site with
proper siting, and a formal design (e.g. soil cover, leachate management, ventilation,
vermin breeding control, etc.) will be used.
x  Ensure that no hazardous wastes are stored or disposed of at waste disposal
ground.

ARDROP
Consequence of Residual Effect
After implementation of mitigation measures, this potential for adverse effects will be
reduced. The residual effect is deemed to be insignificant.
5.1.3   GROUNDWATER
DECREASED GROUNDWATER QUALITY AS A RESULT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
SPILLS
The Jinja area is considered to have low groundwater potential because of the fine-
grained overburden and the resulting decrease in surface water infiltration. Water tables
in the Kakira area are found at a depth of 51 m (overburden) and 69 m (bedrock) below
grade; however, given the clay soil conditions, perched shallow water tables are
suspected.
Potential Consequence
Groundwater in the Kakira area may be subject to impact as a result of spills of
hazardous materials, including fuels. The magnitude of effect will depend greatly on the
type of material released, the area in which the spill occurs, and whether a perched
shallow water table exists. Mitigation measures are required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk of
decreased groundwater quality due to hazardous materials spills:
X Develop a spill prevention plan.
k Prepare and implement chemical handling and storage procedures and train
employees on their use.
- Kakira will conduct regular visual inspections of hazardous materials storage areas,
including aboveground tanks.
k Kakira will ensure that chemical containers are labelled and documentation
regarding safe handling or first aid measures (i.e. MSDS) are accessible from each
storage and use location.
x Kakira will make spill clean-up equipment readily available in chemical storage
areas.
x Kakira will ensure that chemical containers are stored in a safe fashion in a
designated storage area to reduce the potential for containers falling over and
spilling.
x Construct concrete berm around areas where liquids are stored to contain any
spillage
X Work will be monitored during construction to ensure there are no releases of
deleterious substances.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Following the implementation of mitigation, the probability of impacts to groundwater will
be reduced. This effect was deemed insignificant.

5.1.4   SURFACE WATER
DECREASED SURFACE WATER QUALITY DUE TO INCREASED WASTEWATER
DISCHARGES
There are currently three effluent streams discharged from the factory: mill effluent; filter
effluent; and centrifugal effluent. These streams combine and are later joined by minor
effluent streams from the canteen and the sweets factory and overflow from the spray
ponds. The latter receives cooling and condenser waters from the vacuum pans and
evaporators. The wastewater discharge then continues through the sugar plantation
fields, is joined by the Muwala Stream, which finally discharges into the Chico River
flowing north.
Kakira recently received its waste discharge permit from DWD. In its environmental
monitoring programme, Kakira has been sampling individual effluent streams, as well as
combined wastewater streams, on a monthly basis and analysing for the following
parameters:
l  PH                                 x  temperature
l  5-day Biological Oxygen Demand     X  Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
x  total suspended solids (TSS)       x  turbidity
k  total dissolved solids (TDS)       x  total phosphorus, nitrate and nitrogen
flow
The results of a 2002 wastewater-sampling program of each individual effluent stream
have been compared to the conditions of Kakira's recently received waste discharge
permit and Uganda's Effluent Discharge Standards (Wardrop, 2002). In general, many
of the parameters exceeded the permit conditions at some point in time. Note that this
comparison is probably most relevant for the combined factory effluent stream, before it
passes through the sugar plantations, because it constitutes the undiluted, combined
'industrial waste" stream stipulated in the permit.
X  Factory Effluents - These effluent streams refer to the wastewater streams from the
sugar cane factory and include the mill, centrifugal and filter effluents before
combining with other water/waste streams. Analytical results of wastewater samples
collected are presented in Wardrop 2002. The results show that the temperature, pH,
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), 5-day Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) of
samples collected from all three streams exceed the permit conditions.
w  Temperature of these streams were in the range of 49.1to 54.6 degrees Celsius
compared to specified range of 20 to 3 5 degrees Celsius. The pH of the mill
effluent and the centrifugal effluent were 9.4 and 10.5 respectively and exceeded
the specified range of 6.0 to 8.0.
i BOD5 and COD of these streams, particularly the centrifugal stream with a
BOD5 and COD of 1037 and 3038 mg/l respectively, also significantly exceeded
the specified permit conditions of 335 and 1450 for BOD5 and COD respectively.

Filter and centrifugal effluents also have high Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
concentrations (470 and 212 mg/l respectively), which exceed the permit
condition of (175 mg/I).
Effluent from the centrifuge station has high true colour {(357 platinum cobalt
units) Ptco)}, which is above the standard value of 100 Ptco, while that from the
filter and mill was 74 and 52 Ptco respectively.
The results also showed that Filter and Centrfugal effluents had TDS
concentrations of 1,324 and 2,156 mg/l respectively, which are above the
recommended standard of 1000 mg/I. A review of the TDS results obtained by
Kakira shows that the TDS content of these effluents was on average = 200 mg/l
for most of the time and hence below the recommended guideline value. The
latter was exceeded only once during the sampling period by the centrifugal
effluent with a value of 1,890 mg/I.
The nutrient content of these effluents (Total Phosphorus (Total-P) and nitrogen
(measured as TKN)) falls within the effluent guideline values. Values for Total
Phosphorus of less than 1 mg Total-P/I (Guideline value is 10 mg/I) and TKN of
less than 1.5 mg/l were obtained with no TKN detected in the filter effluent.
However, analysis of Total-P by Kakira (for the period between 25/07-7/09/2001)
shows that the standard value was exceeded by the Mill station effluent (18 mg/I)
and the filter station (11.7 mg/I). Observed levels of phosphorus at the filter
station may be attributed to addition of phosphoric acid in the clarifier stage, and
possibly from phosphate-based fertilizer residue on the cane.
The total sulphates of these effluents were very low (less than 2 mg/I) compared
to the guideline value of 500 mgA for effluent discharge.
Results for the oil and grease analysis of selected samples (mill, filter, centrifugal
and factory effluent through the plantation) showed low levels (less than 1 mg/I)
compared to the guideline value of 10mg/l. The filter effluent had the highest
value of 0.780 mg/l while the centrifugal effluent had the lowest of 0.007 mg/I.
The low oil and grease concentration in the effluents is likely attributed to good
maintenance and housekeeping practices in the factory.
Combined Factory Effluent - Sampling locations were a few metres from the factory
premises, further as it flows through the plantation, just before joining the Muwala
stream (tributary of the Chico River) and finally its combination with the Chico River.
Results show that the combined effluent as it leaves the factory premises has
temperature, true colour, TSS, COD and BOD5 values which fall outside the effluent
discharge standards. However, this is further confirmed by the historical data (Table
6). We noted the COD and BOD5 of this stream (1,382 and 214 mg/I respectively)
do not exceed Kakira's permit conditions.
According to the Environment Superintendent of the factory, their efforts since
2002 (the first year of operation under the permit) towards reducing the pollution
strength of the final effluent have involved improvement in housekeeping as well

as reduction of the amount of wastewater discharged. Note that reduction in
wastewater volumes may increase pollutant concentrations.
Samples collected and analysed further downstream generally showed reduced
pollution levels, except for BOD5 (223 mgA compared to the initial value of 214
mg/I) just before the effluent joins the Muwala stream.
Chico Composite - The Chico composite has lower values of BOD5 (126 mg/I) and
COD (232 mg/l) compared to the combined factory effluent before joining the
Muwala stream. This is probably due to dilution by the Muwala stream resulting in an
increased flow rate.
Considering the likelihood of communities downstream using the rivers waters
for domestic purposes, the Chico composite quality was compared to the
Uganda Standard Specification for Drinking Water (February 1994). It was found
that the water quality with respect to colour and turbidity does not meet the
standard. In addition, this stream has very low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (<1
mg/I) and may impact on the aquatic life (e.g., many types of fish cannot survive
when levels of DO drop below 2-5 mg DO/I).
A metal scan analysis of this wastewater further shows that the iron levels (5.6
mg/I) are above both the effluent discharge and drinking water standards (5 mg/I
and 0.3-3.5 mgA respectively). This may be attributed to the Muwala stream,
which being a groundwater source (with a high TDS) probably has high levels of
this metal. Furthermore, the manganese level of this wastewater (0.59 mg/I)
does not fall within the drinking water standards range (0.1-0.5), although it is
within the acceptable range for effluent discharge standards (1 mg/I). This again
shows that presence of this metal in the Chico composite may be due to the
Muwala stream. KSW does not use iron or manganese for its processes, so it is
likely that the elevated iron and manganese in the wastewater are naturally
occurring.
No lead, copper and nickel were detected in the wastewater stream. Low levels
of Al (0.01 mg/l), Zinc (0.23 mg/I), Chromium (0.03 mg/l) was found in this
composite stream and all were within the acceptable effluent discharge and
drinking water standards. Cadmium was found at a level of 0.01 mgA, which
though compliant with the effluent discharge standards, is on the borderline for
drinking water standards (0.01 mg/I). This is a concem in view of the use of the
river by downstream communities for drinking purposes. The potential source of
this metal in the Chico composite is either runoff from the estates fields or
sediments in the natural river waters.
With factory expansion, the volume of wastewater generated will increase. With
increased efforts to reduce water consumption, concentrations of each parameter will
likely also increase.

Potential Consequence
Water quality of the waters receiving effluent from the factory (Muwala Stream and Chico
River) could be adversely affected unless mitigation measures are implemented.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk of
decreased water quality due to effluent release:
x Kakira's overall expansion plan includes a wastewater treatment system. A
preliminary design has been completed. The proposed wastewater treatment
system consists of four components:
Oil, grease and grit separation, using separators installed at or close to the
sources of the oil, grease or grit contaminants.
A primary settling and flow equalisation pond with a 24 hydraulic retention time
(HRT)
An anaerobic pond with a 3 day HRT.
An 'aerobic' pond with a 24 hour HRT.
It is expected that the discharge from the waste water treatment will be meet the
discharge standards given in the Sugar Manufacturing Guideline of the World Bank
(PPAH, 1998). This means that strict monitoring of discharge from the treatment will be
necessary in order to minimise the impacts of the discharge onto the quality of the water
quality of the streams that are used by local communities.
* Reduce water use to minimize the wastewater generated.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Following the implementation of mitigation, the quality of the wastewater leaving Kakira
will be within guidelines. The potential for effects on surface water quality will be greatly
reduced. The residual effect is deemed to be insignificant.

DECREASED HEALTH OF MAMMALS AND BIRDS AND INCREASED INTRODUCTION OF
NUISANCE SPECIES AND VECTORS AS A RESULT OF WASTE DISPOSAL
Waste (including hazardous waste) and wastewater are currently disposed of untreated
within the Kakira Estate.
Hazardous wastes that are generated and stored (at least temporarily) on the property
include waste oil drums, chemical containers and small quantities of hazardous solid
wastes (e.g. sulphur ash) and biomedical wastes. Further, some hazardous wastes such
as sulphur ash are disposed of at the old quarry site, which is not appropriate

disposed at the quarry are minimal at this time. However, Kakira does not hold a permit

to operate a disposal site, and the site does not have a formal design (e.g. soil cover,
leachate management, ventilation, vermin breeding control) to meet the provisions of
NEMA or best management practices.
Potential Consequence
There is the potential for birds and animals to come into contact with improperly stored
and/or disposed of wastes generated at Kakira. Some of these wastes may be harmful
to these organisms. Nuisance species and vectors may also inhabit improperly
designed waste dumping areas. Mitigation is required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease of health effects to
mammals and birds and to decreased the potential for the introduction of nuisance
species and vectors:
. The hazardous waste storage facility should be designed in accordance with best
management practices.
Best management practices for landfill design and operation are provided in the
Solid and Hazardous Waste Management Plan (Wardrop, 2002).
Kakira should arrange to obtain an appropriate permit from NEMA for the operation
of waste disposal site. Proper siting and formal design of the waste disposal site
(e.g. soil cover, leachate management, ventilation, vermin breeding control) should
be undertaken in coordination with NEMA to meet the provisions of the regulation
and best management practices.
Kakira can dispose of its waste at a licensed off-site facility when such a unit is
established in the vicinity.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Following the implementation of mitigation measures, the residual effect on mammals
and birds is deemed to be insignificant.
5.1.6   VEGETATION
Any adverse impacts to vegetation will be as a result of the transmission line. As routing
has not been confirmed, these potential effects cannot be evaluated.
5.2     SOCIAL EFFECTS

DECREASED DRINKING WATER QUALITY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED WASTE WATER
DISCHARGES
Potential Consequence
As a result of factory expansion, wastewater discharges will increase. Discharge of
untreated effluent is currently a major concem for downstream communities on the
Chico River. As these communities likely use the water for domestic purposes including
drinking water, the quality of the water will affect the use of this resource. Residents of
communities downstream of Kakira use the Water quality of the waters receiving effluent
from the factory (Muwala Stream and Chico River) could be adversely affected unless

LOSS OF LAND USE DUE TO TRANSMISSION LINE PLACEMENT
Depending on the route selected for the transmission line right-of-way, land use may be
adversely affected. This is especially true if a new corridor is selected over an existing
one. As routing has not been confirmed, these potential effects cannot be evaluated.
5.2.3   EMPLOYMENT
DECREASED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS A RESULT OF FACTORY EXPANSION
Kakira's factory expansion plan includes automation of a number of steps. As a result,
there is a potential for decreased employment at the factory.

WARDROP
Potential Consequence
In order to facilitate an increase in production to 4000 TCD, a number of modifications
and upgrades are required within the factory at each processing stage. Some of these
modifications include increased reliance on mechanized equipment. Details are
provided in Section 3.3. As a result, some factory staff will be displaced.
Mitigation
Kakira is aware of employment concems as a result of the factory expansion. Kakira will
endeavour to transfer and train displaced workers in other areas of the factory, including
the cogeneration facility.
Consequence of Residual Effect
With the implementation of mitigation, it is anticipated that there will be no reduction in
the workforce at Kakira.
5.2.4   PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
INCREASED NOISE
The results from the noise sampling conducted at Kakira as part of the 2002 audit
indicate that the workers assigned to many areas in the factory may be exposed to
harmful noise levels. These areas include: cane preparation and crushing mill; the pans;
the clarifiers; the sugar bagging house; the evaporators; the foundry; the centrifuges; the
mechanical shop; the power plant and near the boilers. Noise measurements indicated
that workers in these areas might be exposed to noise levels above Uganda's proposed
noise standard (85 dB (A)) over an 8-hour shift.
Potential Consequence
Based on the addition of two boilers and one turbogenerator, the cumulative noise
emission levels during operation of the expanded cogeneration facility may increase by
as much as 10 dBA over current levels in those areas of the factory (Tables 11 c and d).
This increase is considered a 'worst case" scenario because it assumes that the new
equipment will release the same amount of noise as all of the equipment in use during
the 2002/2003 noise monitoring events. Increased noise as a result of infrastructure
other than the generators and boilers has not been included in this assessment.
Because increased noise levels can impact human health, mitigation is required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk to human
health and safety as a result of increased noise generation:
x  Conduct personal monitoring of employees in the areas of elevated noise levels to
determine the appropriate noise rating of PPE. This should include those employees
who may pass through noisy areas on their way to their workstation.

x Provide appropriate PPE to staff working in high-noise areas.
x Ensure that workers are trained on proper use of PPE.
A  Construct and install silencers for steam discharges.
Consequence of Residual Effect
Following the implementation of mitigation, the impacts on human health and safety as a
result of increased noise is deemed to be insignificant.
INCREASED POTENTIAL EFFECTS INDUCED FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Depending on the route selected for the transmission line right-of-way, people living
adjacent to the corridor could be adversely affected by electromagnetic fields (EMF). As
routing has not been confirmed, these potential effects cannot be evaluated.
REDUCED HUMAN HEALTH AS A RESULT OF AIR EMISSIONS
As discussed in Section 5.1.1, there are a number of air emissions coming from Kakira.
These air emissions will likely increase substantially after factory expansion and
implementation of cogeneration.
Potential Consequence
There is a potential for worker and public health effects from reduced air quality as a
result of emissions and dust. Risk to worker health is likely greater than public health,
depending on the proximity to the activity. Air pollutants from vehicles and equipment,
as well as dust from bagasse handling, may cause distress to workers that come in
contact with it. Mitigation is required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease emissions and dust during
operation of the expanded facility:
* The boilers will be equipped with a dry ash collection system and a full wet scrubber
to reduce the amount of ash released into the environment. A properly chosen,
sized and maintained wet scrubber should remove greater that 90% of the
particulate emissions from the bagasse boilers (US EPA, 1996). If this removal is
applied to the calculated air dispersion results provided in Appendix B, the maximum
24-hour concentration of particulates that could escape into the surrounding
environment would be 260 j.g/m3. This is less than the maximum Uganda AQS
Standard (300 1Lg/m3).
A Kakira will develop a bagasse handling management plan to manage bagasse
supply and demand to the boilers and to ensure bagasse quality is maintained
during storage.
A Repair leakages in bagasse and bagacillo chutes to reduce dust releases.
A Cover trucked materials during transport.
A  Provide Personal Protective Equipment and training to personnel working directly
with dust-generating materials.

ARDROP
Consequence of Residual Effect
Air emissions are one of the major environmental outputs at Kakira. Emissions are
released throughout the sugar manufacturing process and will be released during
cogeneration activities. Following implementation of measures to control air emissions,
the probability that air emissions will be in excess of guideline values will likely be
reduced. Follow up monitoring may be required to determine actual concentrations of
contaminants emitted from the expanded facility. As Kakira has committed to installing
pollution control devices and has already changed the sulphitation process resulting in a
reduction in S released to the atmosphere, the resultant residual effect after
implementation of mitigation was evaluated to be of low significance.
DECREASED HUMAN HEALTH DUE TO IMPACTED DRINKING WATER
Potential Consequence
As a result of factory expansion, wastewater discharges will increase. Discharge of
untreated effluent is currently a major concem for downstream communities on the
Chico River. As these communities likely use the water for domestic purposes including
drinking water, the quality of the water will affect the use of this resource. Residents of
communities downstream of Kakira use this water source for domestic purposes.
Human health could be affected if untreated effluent continues to be discharged into the
water system. Mitigation is required.
Mitigation
The following mitigation measures are proposed to decrease the potential risk of
decreased water quality due to effluent release:
A  Kakira's overall expansion plan includes a wastewater treatment system. A
preliminary design has been completed. The proposed wastewater treatment
system consists of four components:
Oil, grease and grit separation, using separators installed at or close to the
sources of the oil, grease or grit contaminants.
A primary settling and flow equalisation pond with a 24 hydraulic retention time
(HRT)
An anaerobic pond with a 3 day HRT.
co An 'aerobic" pond with a 24 hour HRT.
* Reduce water use to minimize the wastewater generated.

Following the implementation of mitigation, the quality of the wastewater leaving Kakira
will be within guidelines. The potential for effects on human health will be greatly
reduced. The residual effect is deemed to be insignificant.

5.3     POSITIVE EFFECTS
Following the implementation of mitigation, the proposed project will lead to many
positive effects in both the biophysical and social environments. These include the
following:
X  Improved Surface Water Quality - Following the construction and implementation
of the wastewater treatment system, effluent quality leaving the factory will be
improved. As a result, the quality of the receiving streams will also likely improve.
x  Reduced Unit Air Emissions - Kakira's project design includes various air
emission controls designed to reduce the unit air emissions.
A  Reduced Fossil Fuel Requirements for Steam Generation - Buming bagasse,
which is a waste product of sugar processing, reduces the requirement for use of
fossil fuels to generate steam. This steam is then used for both factory operations
as well as for generating electricity. Emissions related to energy consumption for
steam generation will decrease.
Storage and Disposal of Excess Bagasse - Disposal and storage of bagasse is an
on-going challenge for Kakira. Excess bagasse, or bagasse that is too wet for
buming, is stored in a covered storage area near the boilers. Approximately 450
tons of bagasse is transported in uncovered trucks every day to the sugar cane
fields for buming. While not a hazardous material, bagasse creates nuisance dust
and is thus damaging to the environment. Bagasse buming also creates nuisance
conditions for surrounding communities. Stockpiles of damp bagasse create ideal
conditions for growth of toxic moulds that can be a health hazard for employees.
The expansion of the cogeneration facility will substantially eliminate the excess
bagasse problem.
x  Reduced Fossil Fuel Requirements for Transport of Bagasse - Currently,
approximately 60 litres of fuels is used per day to transport bagasse from the factory
to the fields for disposal. The expansion of the cogeneration facility will eliminate this
step in the process.
k  Improved Air Quality - Buming of bagasse the cogeneration facility rather than in
agricultural fields will lead to improved air quality as a result of decreased generation
of carbon monoxide due to more efficient combustion and decreased nuisance
smoke.

6.0 ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
6.1 STATUS QUO
"Altematives to" the project are functionally different ways to meet the project need and
achieve the projected purpose. The Status Quo altemative, or the alternative of not
constructing the project, is described below.
The Status Quo altemative comprises the current operations at KSW, as described in
Section 3 of this report. KSW processes approximately 900,000 tonnes of cane per
year, crushing sugarcane at the rate of over 3000 tonnes of cane crushing per day
(TCD).
KSW bums bagasse in four fuel boilers to generate steam to drive factory prime movers
such as turbo-generators, mill turbines and turbo-pumps, and for use in sugar
processing in the Boiling House. The total steam capacity of the plant in 90 T/h. The
steam requirement at the current operating level (2500 TCD) is 75 T/h, which is supplied
by operating boilers 1 and 4 with extra steam from boilers 2 and/or 3, as required. The
flue gas from the boilers is vented to the outdoors via three tall stacks. The boilers are
not equipped with any pollution control equipment. Fumace ash is manually removed
from the boilers and trucked to a disposal area or used in the field as a soil amendment.
High-pressure steam is partly used to drive the Steam Turbine Drives in the sugar mill.
The balance of the high-pressure steam is fed to the turbo-generators where the steam
energy is converted to electrical energy. This electricity is used to drive equipment in the
factory, foundry, workshop, offices and residential areas. The exhaust low-pressure
steam from the turbine is then used in the sugar manufacturing process. The
cogeneration process is described in Figure X.
KSW also has five diesel generator sets with a combined capacity of 2,500 KVA.
Currently, KSW's intemal power generation is only used for intemal needs (sugar factory
and some ancillary units). KSW purchases electricity form UEDCL to provide electricity
for its infrastructure (housing, street lighting, sweets factory and irrigation).
6.2 EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION
The environmental interactions between the current operation and the environment are
identified in Table 8a. The following environmental parameters are affected by the
current operations at KSW:
x  Air quality- Fugitive dust and petroleum hydrocarbon emissions are emitted during
various phases of the sugar process. Emissions from the boiler stacks, exhaust from
the syrup suphitor and fugitive fly ash emissions from burning bagasse all have the
potential to impact air quality.

ARDROP
x  Surface Water Quality - Surface water is affected by the release of wastewater to
the River Kiko. Water is pumped from Lake Victoria.
x  Vegetation - Vegetation is removed for the sugar process. Fumace ash is applied to
agricultural soils as a soil amendment.
x Mammals and Birds - Noise generated during the sugar process may adversely
affect mammals and birds in the area; however, it is likely that these organisms are
accustomed to these operations.
x Fish and Aquatic Invertebrates - Impacts to surface water quality can lead to
effects on aquatic organisms. Specifically, the addition of wastewater effluents to
natural water bodies and potential deposition of dust and other air emissions on the
water may adversely affect these organisms.
x Nuisance Species and Vectors - Nuisance species may be more prevalent as a
result of disposal of solid wastes, hazardous wastes and sewage.
The following social components are affected by the current operations at KSW:
x Land and Resource Use - The lands within the KSW Estate comprise mainly sugar
cane acreages. There is increasing interest in cultivating sugar cane over other
traditional food and cash crops (Bhatt, 1998).
x  Public Health and Safety- Public health concems are mainly associated with air
quality.
6.3     CONCLUSION
If the KSW Cogeneration Expansion project is not implemented, none of the positive
effects listed in Section 5.3 will be achieved. With the implementation of the proposed
mitigation measures, the overall significance of this project will be low.

7.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
MANAGEMENT PLAN
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is defined as an instrument that details:
a  the measures to be taken during the implementation and operation of a project to
eliminate or offset adverse environmental impacts, or to reduce them to acceptable
levels
a  the actions needed to implement these measures (World Bank, OP 4.01).
7.1 MITIGATION MEASURES
Mitigation is defined as the elimination, reduction and control of the adverse effects of a
project. Mitigation measures outlined in Section 5 of this report are summarized in Table
13. Descriptions and technical details of the mitigation measures, responsibilities for
implementation, schedules, methods, and sources of funds are also detailed.
7.2 INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING AND TRAINING
KSW has been operating a cogeneration facility with relatively old equipment and little or
no pollution control. They have introduced an environmental management system. The
proposed cogeneration project will include the establishment of modem equipment and
the employment of new/improved methods of environmental management to satisfy the
requirements identified as mitigation measures in this report. As a result, institutional
strengthening and training of human resources at KSW will be required in order to meet
this challenge.
The main objective of the Institutional Strengthening is to strengthen the institutional
capacity within KSW to implement the mitigation measures in the report and to thereby
contribute to social and environmental sustainable development. The proposed
mechanism for institutional strengthening and training at KSW includes:
x Training of personnel to handle the equipment for cogeneration project by the
contractor who is to install the equipment.
a Closer co-ordination among existing activities and the cogeneration project at KSW.
a Enhancement of environmental management capacity throughout the company.

7.3 MONITORING
An Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) has been developed to verify the accuracy of
the environmental assessment and to determine the effectiveness of measures taken to
mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the project. Specifically, it will provide
information on whether the predicted impacts of the project are within the specified
limits, and will provide early waming information of any unacceptable environmental
conditions. A more comprehensive EMP that will take into consideration the impacts of
the transmission line will be made after public consultations and social assessment of
the proposed line after a decision has been made by the developer and UEDCL.
Kakira currently has a routine inspection and monitoring program in place for certain
aspects of their operations, including noise monitoring. Additional data has been
collected for effluent and surface water quality, as well as air quality. The EMP will build
upon the program already in place. Records will be kept by the Environmental Lead at
Kakira, or designate, and reported to NEMA and/or other authorities, as appropriate.

KAKIRA SUGAR WORKS BAGASSE COGENERATION EXPANSION
1. Introduction. Kakira Sugar Works (1985) Ltd. (KSW), formed in 1985, currently has
a crushing capacity of 2500 tones of cane per day (TCD). In 1995-96, KSW decided
to expand its sugar processing facilities to 5000 TCD based on the envisaged market
for sugar in Uganda and the study on agriculture options for the South Busoga region
of Uganda. As a consequence of this basic expansion, KSW decided to expand its
cogeneration capacity from the current 4.5MW.  In general such cogeneration
capacity expansions would be sized to meet the additional requirements of the
expanded sugar crushing plant. However, this practice would result in considerable
underutilization of the bagasse, the excess of which would be bumed in the field. In
light of the need for additional electricity generation capacity in the grid network,
KSW submitted a proposal to the Government offering to expand its cogeneration
facility beyond its own needs, and supply electricity to the national grid network.
2. KSW already has prepared and received approval from the National Environmental
Management Agency (NEMA) of Uganda for an EIA covering the overall sugar
expansion program to 5000 TCD including the expanded cogeneration facility for the
estimated increased bagasse supply of 160,000 TB/y.
3. In subsequent discussion, the Government reduced its requirement of electricity
supply from KSW to peak hours only (1800-2400hours) and KSW decided to
implement a phased expansion programme for the expansion of its factory and
cogeneration facilities.
4. In the current phase, KSW plans expansion it factory capacity to 4000 TCD and
installing a new cogeneration facility of 14-15 MW. KSW's existing cogeneration
facilities would be retained in-situ and would be used if required when the new
cogeneration facility is not operational. The new cogeneration facility would provide
electricity for KSW's own envisaged needs (which would be scheduled to be up tO 9
MW off-peak and up to 6 MW during peak hours) and electricity for the national grid
of up to 7 MW during peak hours only.
The current KSW cogeneration project is comprised of:
(a)   an additional boiler
(b)   a new 14-15 MW turbo-generator
(c)   related piping, cabling, electrical equipment, instrumentation and control
systems
(d)   additional bagasse handling equipment
(e)   the necessary civil works for all of the above,
(f)   a new electrical sub-station at Kakira
(g)   A new 33kV distribution from  Kakira to the UEDCL Jinja Industrial
Substation at Mailombili, running parallel to the existing 33KV distribution



line from Kakira to Wairaka and installed above the existing 33KV
distribution line from Wairaka to Mailombili.
5. KSW anticipates accessing World Bank funds from the Energy for Rural
Transformation (ERT) Project for the cogeneration facility expansion. Therefore, the
proposed new EIA for KSW's new cogeneration facility must comply with the
Environmental and Social Management framework developed for the ERT subproject
such as this one, the World Band must also review the EIA and issue a "no-
objection" before funds are released under the ERT Project. For this reason and EIA
focusing on the cogeneration facility must be prepared.
6. Objectives. The objective of this assignment is to prepare an Environmental Impact
Assessment focusing on the KSW new cogeneration facility, including relevant
aspects of related investments such as a new distribution line for evacuating power to
the main grid, if necessary.
7. Environmental Assessment Requirements. The EIA will be consistent with the
following regulations and guidelines which will govern the conduct of the assessment
and specify the content of its report.
* The World Bank's Operation Policy (OP) and Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01:
"Environmental Assessment,"   The Pollution  Abatement and Control
Handbook, and other pertinent policies and procedures;
* National laws and/or regulations on environmental reviews and impact
assessments, including the Environmental and Social Management Framework
prepared for the ERT Project;
* Regional, provincial or communal environmental assessment regulations;
* Environmental assessment regulations of any other financing organizations
involved in the Kakira Cogeneration project.
8. Study Area. The study will focus on the cogeneration facility within the context of
the sugar plant. Therefore, relevant major aspects of the factory operation will also
be included in the analysis as they relate to the cogeneration facility. The study will
also include directly related investment such as transmission facilities, if any,
required for power evacuation to the main grid.
9. Scope of Work.
9.1   Task 1. Description of the Proposed Project. Provide a brief description of the
relevant parts pf the project, using drawings where necessary, and including the
following information: location (provide map); general layout; size, capacity, etc.;
pre-construction activities; construction activities; schedule; staffing and support;
facilities and services; operation and maintenance activities; required offsite
investments; life span, and expected future growth, if any.



9.2   Task 2. Description of the Environment. Assemble, evaluate and present baseline
data on the relevant environmental characteristics of the study area. Include
information on any changes anticipated before the project commences.
(a)  Physical environment: topography; soil; climate and meteorology; ambient air
quality; surface and ground - water hydrology; existing sources of air
emissions; existing water pollution discharges; and receiving water quality.
(b) Biological environment: flora; fauna; rare or endangered species; sensitive
habits; including parks or preserves, significant natural sites, etc; species of
commercial importance; and species with potential to become nuisances, vectors
or dangerous.
(c)  Socio-cultural environment (include both present and projected  where
appropriate): population; land use; planned development activities; community
structures; employment; distribution of income, goods and services, recreation;
public health; cultural properties; tribal people; and customs, aspirations and
attitudes. Include a description of the history and current status of the relations
between KSW and the surrounding communities.
9.3.     Task 3. Legislative and Regulatory Considerations. Describe the pertinent
regulations and standards governing environmental quality, health and safety,
protection of sensitive areas, protection of endangered species, sitting, land use
control, etc, at international, national, regional and local levels. This should
include identification of World Bank safeguard issues that could potentially be
triggered by the project.
9.4.     Task 4. Determination of the Potential Impacts of the Proposed Project. In
this analysis, distinguish between significant positive and negative impacts,
direct and indirect impacts, and immediate and long-term impacts. Identify
impacts which are unavoidable or irreversible. Wherever possible, describe
impacts quantitatively, in terms of environmental costs and benefits. Assign
economic values when feasible.  Characterize the extent and quality of
available data, explaining significant information deficiencies and any
uncertainties associated with predictions of impact. Include implications for
local work force, if any. Identify potential stakeholders in the project as well
as social impacts of land acquisition (if any) associate with the project,
including the transmission lines.
9.5.     Task 5. Analysis of Alternatives to the Proposed Project.  Analyze the
alternative of not constructing the project, in order to demonstrate
environmental conditions without it.
9.6.     Task 6. Development of Environmental and Social Management Plan, with
focus on three generic areas. Mitigation measures, institutional strengthening
and training and monitoring. Descriptions of the latter two should be prepared
in the context of the overall ERT Project, and in particular, the Environmental
and Social Management Framework prepared for that project.



Mitigation of environmental and social impact: Recommend feasible and cost
effective measures to prevent or reduce significant negative impacts to acceptable
levels. Estimate the impacts and costs of those measures. Consider compensation
to affect parties for impact which cannot be mitigated. The plan should include
proposed work programs, budget estimates, schedules, staffing and training
requirements, and other necessary support services to implement the mitigating
measures.
Institutional Strengthening and training:  Identification of institutional needs to
implement environmental assessment recommendations and indicate how these
will provide for.
Monitoring: Indicate how monitoring implementation of mitigation measures and
the impact of the project during construction and operation will be handled.
Include in the plan an estimate of capital and operation costs and description of
other imputes (such as training and institutional strengthening) needed to carry it
out.
9.7   Task 7. Assist in Public/NGO Participation. Identify affected groups and NGOs
which represent them, if any, and assist in obtaining their views. This will
include keeping records of meetings and other activities, communications, and
comments.
10.   Report. The environmental assessment report should be concise and limited to
significant environmental issues.  The main text should focus on findings,
conclusions and recommended actions, supported by summaries of the data
collected and citations for any references used in interpreting those data. Detailed
or interpreted data are not appropriate in the main text and should be presented in
appendices or a separate volume. Unpublished documents used in the assessment
may be readily available and should also be assembled in an appendix. Organize
the environmental assessment report according to the outline below.

Sample Emission Rate Calculations for C02 Emissions from Bagasse-Fired Boiler (Boile
No. 1)
Assumptions:
Please note that the following calculations and SCREEN3 model were completed using all of the
assumptions and documents referred to in Wardrop (2002; Appendix Il -BAir Emissions
Assessment and Dispersion Modelling). The only modification to this original document is that the
bagasse feed rate to the four boilers was increased by 1 00%. In order to assess the worst case
situation, it was assumed for the purpose of this assessment that no other pollution control
systems would be in place.
Emission Rate (g/s) = Bagasse Feed Rate (MT/s) x Emissions Factor (g/MT)
MT = Metric Tons (1 000 kg = 1 MT)
Convert Bagasse Feed Rate to MT/s:

COMMENTS FROM WORLD
BANK AND
CORRESPONDING
RESPONSE



VAtDROP
Appendix E:     Comments from World Bank and Consultant Response
Comments from the Social Reviewer:
I have reviewed the Environmental Assessment for 'Kakira Sugar Works
Cogeneration Expansion", which is a component of the Energy for Rural
Transformation Program in Uganda (not the Private Utility Sector Reform as is
indicated on a sticker on the report). The Kakira component will expand its
cogeneration facility and thereby supply electricity (7 MW) to the national grid network.
Physical installations which will potentially have an impact on people and property
include a new electrical sub-station at Kakira and a new 33 kV distribution line (16 km)
from Kakira to Jinja.
The land required for the Kakira sub-station is approximately 30 meters x 30 meters
and is located next to the foundry and I understand, on KSW company grounds.
Unless people are squatting on this area, it will not be an issue.
An environmental assessment (EA) has not yet been carried out for the distribution
line, however it will be carried out once the exact route has been determined and a
resettlement action plan (RAP) will be prepared. It is recommended that the RAP be
prepared at the same time as the EA, in order to save time.
I find that the EA is close to being adequate as it is, just a few sections that need to
better address the issues and which will require some more work, see below:
If the crushing of sugar cane will increase from 3000 tonnes per day to 5000 tonnes
per day, this must mean that the area of sugar cane plantations will need to almost
double. Which is the land that will be used for expansion of the plantations? Is it
owned by KSW already, is anyone using it, how will it be otherwise acquired?
The increase in cane supply will be achieved as follows:
*  The major increase in cane supply will be from horizontal expansion of
small outarowers. New farmers have been encouraged by the profitable
and successful experience of the existing 3,600 out-grower farmers who
are registered with and supply cane to the company. Out-grower cane
supply to KSW has already increased from 385,000 TC/y in 2001-02 to
439,0000 TC/y in 2002-03 with a target of 506,000 TC/y in 2003-04 with
further increases of about 200,000 TC/y in the following 2 years.
* Additional 90,000 - 100,000 TC/y (to reach about 600,000 TC/y) through
vertical expansion of improved agricultural practices on the Company
owned Nucleus Estate. Including re-introduction of spray irrigation on
approx. 2,800 hectares. The land is already owned and used by KSW
*  No land acquisition is envisaged.
A minor issue is in "Administrative Framework", where it would be appropriate to
mention the Environmental and Social Management Framework, which also includes a
resettlement policy framework. Under the same heading, paragraph 2.1.5, it would be
appropriate to mention that the World Bank's policy on Involuntary resettlement (4.12)



1ARDROP
will be triggered and the policy used as guidance to prepare
resettlement/compensation plan as needed.
No resettlement activity is envisaged, but appropriate reference is made in the
report.
Not related to safeguards but to social development aspects in general, is the fact that
social issues and social impact are not thoroughly discussed (in chapters 4.5 and 5.2)
and those sections could be developed better.
For example, what will the almost doubling of cane crushing and expansion
mean for the workforce of about 6,000? Will it remain the same? How is the workforce
organized on the estate and how have the employees participated in the development
of the expansion idea? What are the social and economic circumstances of their
existence? For one thing, will the energy surplus to the national grid benefit them?
Since the major expansion in cane supply is to come from out-grower farmers,
the company's employment is not expected to increase significantly
Increased Nucleus Estate intensity of agricultural operations has already required
an increase of about 500 farm workers and this is likely to be the steady state
situation.
The KSW work-force is represented by The National Union of Plantation and
Agricultural Workers (NUPA W), whose chairman is Kutosi Esau, and General
Secretary is Hon Pajobo Joram Bruno. The Union is affiliated to the National
Organisation of Trades Unions, Uganda.
The increased energy supply to the national grid during peak hours will provide
relief to the national short fall and will result in reduced load shedding for the
country as a whole.
If Kakira did not plan to self-generate the additional electric power that will be
required for the factory expansion this would have imposed a further demand
burden on the national grid.
The Company's own infrastructure (including housing, schools, hospital, etc.) will
be provided self generated power instead of the present supply from the national
grid - providing the employees reliable electricity supply with out load shedding.
Will the expansion involve modemisation in terms of equipment and will that affect the
number of people employed?
Whilst modern technology will be used for the new Cogeneration Plant, this will
be an augmentation to KSW's facilities and no retrenchment of factor workers is
envisaged.
2



NIRDROP
A public consultation meeting of local leaders was held on 5 March 2004 at
Kakira and these issues were discussed in detail. The minutes of the meeting are
attached in Appendix F of the report.
How will retrenchment be addressed? Agreed, this is not an social assessment
but one will need to know more about the 6,000 people who work on the estate
and who will be affected in one way or another.
There might not be extensive retrenchment since the increase in crushing
capacity will more than compensate the introduction of new technology. The
economies of scale of production (about 150, 000 tons per year in 4-5 years) will
result in less production costs and the company will be more competitive against
the cheap imported sugar.
Ideally, Kakira works very closely with its outgrowers. This means that the
company will be able to monitor the relocation of employees from the company to
work with the outgrowers. The employees likely to be most affected will be the
drivers of the company who have been ferrying away the excess bagasse to the
fields for burning.
Comments from the Environmental Reviewer:
I read the EA report and have the following comments:
1. Page 8. The World Bank Safeguard Policies need to be identified and
explained how these safeguard policies will be addressed. The Environmental
Assessment Safeguard Policy applies. The World Bank Pest Management
Safeguard Policy might apply as well. In case the pest management policy applies a
pest management plan needs to be prepared for the increase in sugar cane
production by outgrowers, which would likely result in increased pesticide production,
to be used by the factory for sugar manufacturing. It is not clear if pesticides are used
by outgrowers (needs to be discussed with the TTL). KSW itself does not use
pesticides for sugar cane cultivation. The outgrower project should also not result in
destruction of natural forest (clearance of natural forest for agricultural production, this
would trigger the World Bank's Natural Habitat Safeguard Policy).
Kakira's out-growers do not generally use pesticides as there are no pests that
affect sugar cane plantations in the South Busoga area.
Expansion of out-grower cane areas is not expected to result in any destruction of
natural forests. Kakira encourages farmers to only utilise two thirds of their land
for sugarcane; the balance one third is suggested to be used for food crops,
grazing and forestry. It is expected that the area planted to trees will actually
increase as farmers plan to utilise timber for other economic activity on a
sustainable basis.
Kakira's Out-growers Department visit each out-grower farmer prior to registration
and ensures that farmers comply with national environmental regulations and
3



VARDROP
also leave adequate land for cultivation of subsistence / food crops etc.
The company has instituted a clearly defined policy on outgrowers. Kakira has
acquired a Global Position System (GPS) to map out boundaries of sugar cane
estates owned by outgrowers. The coordinates are to be used to derine the actual
size of the fields and the actual boundaries with fragile and sensitive ecosystems
(the company does not deal with any outgrowers who are growing sugar in
sensitive ecosystems). If the out-grower is to increase the acreage of the fields,
the company will have to be informed and it approves the proposed changes.
These will again be entered in the database with the outline map drawn. It will
therefore not be possible to change the size of the fields without consent from
Kakira.
2. Page 11. The consultants should use also the following guidelines:
Sugar Manufacturing, Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (PPAH), 1998,
which specifies the air emission, liquid effluent and ambient noise standards and
monitoring requirements for sugar manufacturing, (the EA states the date of
this report is 2001, should be corrected); General Environmental Guidelines,
PPAH, 1998; IFC Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines (on website:
www.ifc.org); Monitoring, PPAH, 1998. The PPAH can be found on the IFC website:
www.ifc.ora and on the World Bank website; www.worldbank.ora. The project should
also comply with the applicable Ugandan pollution control standards; whichever
standard
is more stringent (Ugandan or World Bank standard).
This has been effected in the report.
The emission rates of g/s should also be converted in the units of the World Bank
guidelines, e.g. mg/Nm3 (table B1, table 5, etc.).
There are no direct conversion factors to convert g/s to mg/Nm3. In order for us
to present our findings in mg/Nm3 we would require re-modelling of freshly
collected data from the field. Our main intention of using an emission rate of g/s
was to emphasize the load of the emissions coming out of the stack. It should
also be noted that the correct and reasonable usage of the guidelines is for
comparison of "already dispersed"maximum ground level concentrations, which
is the air people are actually exposed to.
2. Figure 4 and Figure 6 are the same.
Fixed in the final report
3. Page 29. The World Bank noise standard for cane mills is not 90 dBA,
but 70 dBA in industrial areas and 55 dBA in day time in residential/educational
areas, being reduced during night time to 45 dBA (22:00-07:00). See PPAH
page 403. The noise standards for the project need to be adapted to the World
Bank guideline which is more stringent than the Ugandan noise standard.
Construction noise levels will be higher, but need to be mitigated. Operational noise
levels need to comply with the 70 dBA, which means that mitigation measures, such
4



IWIDROP
as isolation of noise sources might be required.
This has been changed in the report.
4. The 24-hour maximum ambient guideline for nitrogen oxides of 150
micrograms/m3 as mentioned in the General Environmental Guidelines of the PPAH
needs to be respected.
Noted
5. Total Particular Matter emissions are high. The General Environmental
Guidelines of the World Bank (PPAH, 1998 page 437) mention standards for ambient
particulate matter: Annual arithmetic mean of 50 microgram/m3; and Maximum 24
hour average of 70 microgram/m3. These standards need to be complied with.
Noted
6. Page 39. almost at the bottom of the page: ..... The maximum pollutant
concentrations are found at 183 m from the source. It would be useful to mention
which concentration of S02 is found at this distance.
We state in section 5.1.1 that "emissions of sulfur dioxide from the boilers are
also considered negligible, owing to the characteristically low levels of sulfur
associated with bagasse." Therefore dispersion of the gas up the stack will
render it extremely negligible at 183 m.
7. Page 43. Transformer oils should be tested if they are PCB oils. If they are PCB
oils, they should be shipped to Europe for incineration. In Africa at present there is not
such an incineration facility and indefinite storage is not an option. The project should
include a budget for the transport and incineration of the PCBs.
The costs have been included in the report.
8.  Page 48. It should be stated which are the expected wastewater discharge
concentrations at the outlet of the wastewater plant. The effluent needs to comply
with effluent standards mentioned in the Sugar Manufacturing guideline of the World
Bank (PPAH, 1998). Strict adherence will be required since communities downstream
use the river as a drinking water source.
Appropriate changes have been made in the report
9. Page 59. states that a comprehensive environmental monitoring plan will
be developed. The World Bank requires that this environmental monitoring plan is
part of the present EA.
The plan has been included in the report.

APPENDIX F
MINUTES OF PUBLIC
CONSULTATION MEETING



Minutes   of the   Public  Consultative  Environment Impact
Assessment (ELA) meeting held with the staff and community of
Kakira Sugar Works Ltd
A meeting was held on Friday, 8th March 2004 at Kakira Sugar Works
Ltd (KSW) as part of the requirements for the EIA report. The meeting
was chaired by the General Manager of KSW  who introduced the
consultants from Wardrop. The consultants explained that since the
project was funded by the World Bank, an EIA    and a public
consultative meeting was required and thus the reason for the above
meeting. The other members were asked to introduce themselves. The
members comprised of heads of departments, factory staff, District
Environmental Officer Jinja and Local Council representatives of the
surrounding villages as shown below:
1. Mr C.R.B. Orr        General Manager
2. Dr Mwesigye Patrick  Wardrop Consultant
3. Ms Barbara Batumbya Wardrop Consultant
4. Mr Dickson Lufafa    District Environmental Officer Jinja
5. Mr G. Wabomba        Safety, Health & Environmental Supt
6. Mr Ganesan. S        Electrical Engineer Manager

11. Maboni Jerome       Chairman Kliz Village
12. Vudriga Akulino     Chairman PPG Village
13. Sabwe Jonathan      Rep Chairman III
14. Ariki Joseph        Chairman LC II Karongo Parish
15. Kalibusi Salim      Deputy Electrical Engineer
16. Ofutra Mohammed     Ali Branulia Secretary
17. Florence Akalya     Area Women co-ord Kakira

22. Opale Daniel        C/person LCI Maji Mazrui Village
23. Amule Amosi         C/person LCI Terego Village
The Kakira electrical engineer then gave a brief background of the
cogeneration project. He explained that power from  the steam
generated from the bagasse would be sold to Uganda Electricity
Distribution Company Ltd (UEDCL). He also said that this was the
cheapest form of biomass generation of power. He said that presently
the-bagasse is left to rot in the field and decompose and then mixed
back into the soil. However, sometimes the bagasse is burnt releasing
carbondioxide into the air and thus adding to the green house gases. In
this way the energy is being wasted and yet it can be harnessed and
used for the benefit of Uganda. So the project will produce electricity
not only for use on the estate but also for the country at large.
- - -  -  -  -  -



The chairman then handed over the meeting to Dr Mwesigye, one of
the consultants to get the views of the people on the project. He
emphasized that law requires an EIA to be conducted for a new project
followed by a public consultative meeting with the stakeholders. He
briefly talked about voluntary and involuntary resettlement and
emphasized that the objective of the meeting was to get the views of the
people concerning the project. Their views were in form of questions,
which were as follows;
1. Will the project make the electricity bills lower?
2. Will the houses, which don't have, power presently benefit?
3. Will the people really benefit since the project is funded by the
World Bank?
4. Will the nearest people to Kakira have access to electricity and at
cheaper cost?
5. Will it be possible to change from Uganda Electricty Distribution
to the Kakira electricity and what are the possible costs?
6. In Uganda, how many of such projects exist, or is this the first?
7. Give details of voluntary and involuntary settlement and will there
be compensation for both types of resettlement?
8. What is the advantage to the government on implementation of the
project?
9. Is the project bringing free electricity to the people?
10. What is the biggest advantage concerning the people of Kakira?
11. How much electricity is being generated in the country at the
moment, what are the future plans concerning electricity
production and what is the current percentage use of electricity by
the people of Uganda?
12. Is it safe for Kakira to produce electricity given the fact that it
being produced from steam generated by the baggasse?
13. Will the project utilize all the baggasse or will there still be excess
baggasse?
14. How will the continuous steam production be taken care of since
the machines will have to shut down once in a while for
maintenance?
Reactions to the questions
*  Only 5% of 24 million have access to electricity, so the project is a
positive one. Only 1% of this electricity is in the rural areas and
government's target is to increase from 1% to 10% in the rural
areas. Kakira will therefore help to meet part of this target. So
Kakira has already obtained an Independent Power Producing
license according to the law and a Power Purchasing Agreement has
been made between UEDCL and Kakira, all that is lacking is the
money from the World Bank for implementation of the project.
*  Other factories like Kasese Cobalt are also producing electricity but
its not enough.
*  It was made clear that Kakira will not set up its own distribution
station but will sell directly to UEDCL.
*  About having free electricity, the general manager said that a
policy decision would have to be made concerning the possibility of
free electricity but it is not a guarantee. However there are plans to



connect all the camps which do not presently have electricity and
some of the electricity will also be used for irrigation.
*  Involuntary and voluntary resettlement will be discussed at a later
stage at the transmission line phase. However, he briefly said that
for those within the camps, there would be internal resettlements.
But for those outside the camps the resettlement will be according to
the RAP which will be put in place and communicated to the
concerned parties at a similar meeting.
*  It is safe for Kakira to produce the electricity since steam will be
restricted to the inside of the factory and none will come out. There
are safety valves to release the high pressure built up by the steam.
Besides Kakira is presently producing electricity for its own
consumption so they are experienced. Internally in-house protection
safety will be taken care of especially sound for which ear-plugs
will be provided.
*  The Safety, Health and Environment Superintendent of Kakira also
said that the project will reduce excess baggasse which is presently
a nuisance to the people's health. Fly ash arrestors will be installed
and will prevent ash from getting to people's clothes and houses and
consequently reduce complaints from neighbours.
*  The general manager said that KSW  is considering to import
sugarcane varieties with less fibre and more sugar. This will help in
reducing the baggasse. Small projects of producing charcoal from
baggasse are also being considered such that even the excess
baggasse that has not been used in producing electricity will be
utilized.
*  To take care of the continuous steam production, two mills which
will operate side by side. When one is shut down for maintenance,
then the other one will be working. Storage of the baggasse will be
also be taken care of to ensure constant supply of electricity 365
days a year.
*  Kakira will sell the electricity to UEDCL therefore some profit will
be obtained. However part of the proceeds will be used to service
the loan from the World Bank.
*  The DEO of Jinja had a chance to talk to the forum about the need
for EIA and what it is about.
*  The general manager said that Kakira is committed to protecting
the environment and as such there are quarterly Environmental
meetings to which the DEO of Jinja is also invited to discuss
environmental issues pertinent to Kakira.
Benefits of the project
*  Uganda as a country will benefit by having more power.
*  Employment opportunities for the people who will be involved in
the project.
*  Out growers will benefit since there will be more demand for
sugarcane by Kakira Sugar Works Ltd. It is projected that demand
from the out growers will double in the next 4-5 years. As a result a
monitoring programme for the out growers is being put in place
such that before the farmers expand their field, management will be



consulted to make sure that the sensitive environment like wetland
is not interfered with.
*  For the workers benefit, management is planning an expansion of
the factory consequently increasing the number of workers so as to
lower the cost of production. This will reduce the threat of the
cheaper sugar dumped into the country. Therefore the workers may
not have direct benefits of profit but will have more job security.
*  Camps in Kakira which do not presently have electricity will access
electricity as a result of this project.
The people's view on negative impacts of the project.
*  Vandalism of the electric wires
*  Jobs lost particularly the baggasse drivers
*  Resettlement of the people.
Reactions to the above views
*  The people will be sensitized and a task force will also be put in
place to take care of any vandalism. Under ground cables may also
be considered as a means of minimizing the vandalism of cables,
however underground cables have peculiar disadvantages as well.
*  In the case of drivers who have been driving the baggasse trucks,
none of them will lose a job directly as a result of the project. This
is because turnover of the drivers is high and some have reached
retirement age, while others will be taken to do other jobs.
* A Resettlement Action Plan will be drawn up and disclosed to the
parties concerned. Compensation of the affected parties will then be
effected according to the prevailing district compensation rates.
*  The General Manger also went ahead to explain that he had a
chance of speaking to the president and floated the idea of using
sugar molasses to get ethanol. This ethanol would mixed with fuel.
This would save on the fuel budget and would decrease on the
'nguli' distillers who use sugar molasses to make alcohol and
dispose the dregs into the stream making water unsafe for the
people. The president was keen on the project.
The General manager thanked the participants and closed the meeting.
