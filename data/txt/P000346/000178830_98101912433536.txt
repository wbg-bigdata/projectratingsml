CAMOEROON
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
1.01      Cameroon covers a roughly triangular area of 475,000 km  with
a coastline of about 280 km. It borders on six countries--Nigeria, Chad,
Central African Empire (CAE), Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea--and occupies
a strategic position for transit traffic of landlocked Chad and CAE.
1.02      Cameroon has mountains in the west and in the center, dry savannah
plains in the north and extensive forest areas in the south and southeast.
Along the coast, the rainy season lasts 220 days with an annual rainfall of
5-6 m. In the central mountainous areas, the annual rainfall is about 1.5 m
during a rainy season of about 135 days. By contrast, the rainy season in
the north lasts 50-75 days, with an average annual rainfall of only 0.85 m.
The variety of topography, climate and soil types has influenced the distri-
bution of population and creates different transport problems from region to
region.
1.03      According to the 1976 census, Cameroon has a population of about
7.7 million, growing2at an estimated 2.3% per year.  IJhile the average density
is 16 persons per km , the distribution is uneven.2 The highest concentration
is in the western highlandg with 75 persons per km and the lowest in the east
with only 4 persons per km . About 18 major ethnic groups inhabit the country
and are widely separated. The transport system is thus of paramount importance
in promoting communication and a sense of national unity. Urban areas are
growing rapidly:  The commercial center and port of Douala had 480,000 inhabit-
ants in 1976 compared to 190,000 in 1965.  About 340,000 persons lived in the
capital of Yaounde in 1976, a threefold increase in ten years.  Urbanization
creates a strong demand for passenger transport, since urban dwellers tend to
keep their ties with families in rural villages.
1.04      Gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices was estimated at
CFAF 618 billion or US$2.5 billion in 1976. Betwen 1971 and 1976, although
GDP in real terms grew about 2.5% per year, GDP per capita remained practic-
ally unchanged at US$330. The Fourth Development Plan (FYs 1977-81) has set
a target growth rate of 6% per annum. Agriculture is the most important
sector and provides the livelihood for about 75% of the population. Agricul-
tural production and agro-industries are expected to grow, spurred by rela-
tively favorable prices predicted for the main export crops -- cocoa and
coffee. In addition, forestry exploitation should expand with the opening of
new areas at Deng Deng (near Belabo). An oil refinery and tanker terminal at
Port Limboh (near Victoria) are being planned, while off-shore oil exploration
has begun close to Victoria.



1.05      Cotton bales from north Cameroon are transported more than 1,500
km by road and rail for export through the port of Douala. Cocoa and coffee
from the western highlands and the central mountainous areas are carried by
trucks or by railway about 200-300 km to Douala. Palm oil, rubber, and
tropical fruits are produced in the coastal area and require only a short
transport haul to be exported. In 1977, timber exports amounted to 560,000
tons of which 70% went through Douala and 30% through Kribi. The average
rail distance for timber exports through Douala is 390 km. Expansion of
timber exports depends in part on road improvements in the forest belt which
stretches from the Atlantic coast to the eastern frontier and covers 37% of
Cameroon's area.  A study of forestry road development financed under the
Second Highway Project is now under review in the Bank.
1.06      In addition to agriculture, the Government is giving priority to
transportation under the Fourth Development Plan in order to promote foreign
and regional trade, expand access to agricultural areas and facilitate food
marketing. This policy is basically sound as large areas are still isolated
and many others are served only by rudimentary infrastructure. The Plan
aims at a transport investment of CFAF 176 billion (US$800 million in FY1975
constant prices) or 35% of total public sector investment. This compares
with about CFAF 130 billion on the same price basis under the Third Plan
(FYs1972-76) which represented more than half of the total public sector
investment. However, even this relatively reduced program is rather ambitious
and depends substantially (62%) on foreign contributions.
B.   The Transport System
1.07      The transport infrastructure in Cameroon comprises 57,000 km of
roads; 1,153 km of railways; and one principal port, two minor ports and
one seasonal river port. There is an international airport at Douala and 13
smaller airports. The transport system is export-import oriented and focussed
on Douala. Foreign trade through the port of Douala flows principally along
*the Transcameroon corridor (Douala-Yaounde-Ngaoundere-Maroua-Chad border) and
the Douala-Bafoussam-Foumban corridor.
Railways
1.08      The railway comprises two main lines emanating from Douala:  the
913 km Transcameroon line to N'gaoundere and the 160 km western line to
Nkongsamba together with short branch lines to Kumba and Mbalmayo. In
FY1978 freight traffic totalled 1.3 million tons, over 90% of which was on
the Transcameroon line, and about 1.7 million passengers (1.4 million on the
Transcameroon line). Details of the system and its operations are given in
Chapter II.
Roads and Trucking
1.09      The road network comprises about 2,300 km of paved, 7,000 km
of gravel/laterite roads, and 48,000 km of earth roads and tracks. About
29,000 km of roads are classified mainly according to traffic levels for
maintenance budgeting purposes.



- 3 -
1.10      While the density of the road network averages 0.12 km per km 2
which is similar to that of Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, it varies con-
siderably within the country. It is greatest in densely populated areas of
high economic activity: the coastal/southwestern region along the Douala-
Bafoussam corridor, the central region around Yaounde, and the northern
region around Maroua. The most important trunk roads -- the Douala-Bafoussam-
Foumban road and the northern section of the Transcameroon route -- have
recently been or are being paved.
1.11      Although there has been a great effort to build and rehabilitate
paved roads, in recent years the overall condition of the road network has
deteriorated somewhat due to low initial construction standards, insufficient
maintenance and increasing traffic. Gravel and earth roads, which account
for 92% of the classified road network, are frequently impassable during the
rainy season. In the dry season, corrugated and stony road surfaces and
deep potholes cause excessive wear to vehicles. Consequently, the Govern-
ment is now giving a higher priority to improving road maintenance than in
the past.
1.12      The Ministry of Transport registers new vehicles but does not record
retirement of vehicles from service. The fleet is estimated at about 62,000
vehicles, of which about 55% are cars, 35% trucks and vans, 6% buses and 4%
specialized vehicles. From 1971 to 1975 (the latest date for which informa-
tion is available), new vehicle registrations increased at an average of about
6% p.a.
1.13      Cameroon's road transport industry comprises many small, local firms,
owning only one or a few trucks. Para-statal enterprises such as SODECOTON
and CAMDEV operate their own fleets of trucks. A large segment of truck
transport is carried out by trading companies as part of their business. A
number of firms, both local and foreign specialize in international freight
transport, one-third to one-half of which is allocated to Cameroon by interna-
tional agreements with Chad and CAE. There are three truckers' unions, one
each for the southern, center and northern regions. Only the northern one is
active and its main purpose is to allocate to its members its quasi-monopoly
over Cameroon's share of international freight transshipped at the end of the
rail line at Ngaoundere. There is no effective control over tariffs or entry
into the industry.
Modal Distribution of Traffic
1.14      On a country-wide basis road transport is the dominant transport
mode, linking Douala and Yaounde with provincial centers and serving regional
and local trade. While road transport is also predominant in the Baffoussam
corridor, the railway currently carries most of the freight traffic in the
Douala-Yaounde corridor. This is particularly true in the rainy season,
when the road between Edea and Yaounde is often impassable. The railway has
suffered some shortage of rolling stock and motive power capacity in recent
years, which has tended to suppress traffic. This situation is being remedied,



- 4-
but the increase in traffic which this, together with the anticipated improve-
ment in the growth of the Cameroon economy, is likely to generate will place
strains upon the capacity of marshalling and locomotive maintenance and repair
facilities. The proposed project is designed to overcome these problens.
1.15      Competition between road and rail for freight traffic is based
on freight rates which reflect economic costs, with road-user charges making
an adequate contribution to highway investment cost and rail tariffs for
freight traffic substantially reflecting operating costs. Thus the future
level of competition and the distribution of traffic will be primarily deter-
mined by changes in relative costs, which in turn depend to a large extent
on the relative speed at which road development in the corridor takes place.
This is dealt with in detail below (paras. 1.21 to 1.25).
Air Transport
1.16      Cameroon Airlines (CAMAIR) provides domestic services between
Douala, Yaounde and 12 other domestic airports and international services
between Douala and West Africa and Europe. The fleet consists of one Boeing
707, three Boeing 737's, and one de Havilland Twin-Otter. On domestic ser-
vices, CAMAIR carries about 75,000 passengers annually with traffic concen-
trated betwen Douala and Yaounde. In FY1977 CAMAIR realized an operational
surplus of CFAF 287 million (US$1.1 million) after taxes and depreciation.
Ports
1.17      Douala is the principal port, handling over 90% of Cameroon's for-
eign trade. In 1977 Douala port traffic was 2.5 million tons, of which imports
accounted for 1.7 million tons including 0.4 million tons of petroleum pro-
ducts. Exports of 0.8 million tons included 0.4 million tons of timber and
0.3 million tons of other agricultural products, mainly cocoa, coffee, bananas
and cotton. Since 1969 traffic has grown at 4.7% p.a. with imports increasing
at 7.8% p.a. and exports at 2% p.a. The port is operating at close to full
capacity, and a major project (the Second Douala Port Project) is underway.
This will expand port capacity principally by construction of a new log port
and container berths. Additionally, the channel is being dredged from its pre-
vious 5 meter depth to 7.5 meters, with benefits both in the size of ship which
will be able to enter and the extent to which fully laden ships can enter at
all states of the tide. Another project is being prepared, which would expand
capacity at the adjacent industrial port of Bonaberi. A study will also be
undertaken of the feasibility of constructing a new deepwater port at the
Rocher du Loup (near Kribi) the object of which would be to provide Cameroon
with a second major port capable of evacuating timber, agricultural and possi-
bly mineral exports from southern Cameroon and contributing to economic devel-
opment in the Kribi area. The port of Victoria about 80 km from Douala has
been losing traffic to Douala and now handles insignificant volumes; in 1977,
it handled 2,300 tons of traffic, solely exports. The lighterage port of
Kribi handled 178,000 tons of exports, mainly logs, and 9,800 tons of imports
in 1977. A small river port is located in Garoua on the Benoue river, navig-
able below Garoua from mid-July to mid-October. In 1977, it handled 14,000
tons of cargo.



1.18      The Cameroon National Port Authority (NPA), an autonomous public
corporation, is in charge of port operations in Cameroon except the private
logging port of Campo. The Port Authority is financially self-supporting, and
the financial covenants under the Second Douala Port Project are being met.
C.   Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.19      The Ministry of Transport (MOT), created in 1970, is responsible
for transport sector management, including (a) reviewing, coordinating and
screening transport investment proposals prepared by other ministries and
public agencies, (b) formulating transport policies, and (c) approving the
tariffs of Regifercam, CAMAIR and NPA. However, the Ministry has neither the
qualified staff nor the authority to perform its functions adequately. The
Ministry of Economy and Planning (MINEP) has carried out some transport plan-
ning in the framework of overall development planning, but its limited re-
sources, sufficient when investment decisions consisted mainly of ranking
high-priority projects on the principal transport routes, are inadequate for
the more sophisticated investment choices between major transport modes in
the same corridor. The Ministry of Equipment and Housing (MINEH) is respons-
ible for road planning and has just started to direct its attention to this
task.
1.20      The Bank has had a continuing dialogue with the Government on the
need for strengthening transport sector management. At first, attempts to
reinforce the organization and machinery for transport planning and policy
making met with limited success. Recent developments imply a change in the
Government's attitude. A Planning and Coordination Unit (PCU) has been created
within MOT and two economists have been or are being recruited for three years
each under the Technical Assistance Project (Credit 673-CM, US$4.5 million,
June 1977). One economist will be seconded to MINEP to help ensure coordina-
tion and integration of investment decisions in transport with closely related
sectors such as agriculture and forestry. The other economist is already
seconded to MOT to stimulate and coordinate the work of the PCU. The Third
Highway Project (Loan 1515-CM, US$16.5 million, April 1978) will provide the
PCU with another economist/statistician for three years and four fellowships
for Cameroonians to study abroad. Furthermore, the Government has requested
advice from the Bank on carrying out an overall transport sector study. The
study would be undertaken by Cameroonian professionals and expatriate experts
financed under ongoing transport projects, with Bank staff providing technical
assistance during field missions.
1.21      So far the Government has been preoccupied with completing the
Transcameroon road/rail axis and improving some key domestic roads. It has
thus tended to take a project-by-project approach to investment. The result
has been a road construction program without clearly defined priorities, in
excess of financial resources, and with inadequate project preparation and
evaluation. Road maintenance has received little attention, and in the
absence of good roads there has been strong support for a railway infrastruc-
ture investment program which may turn out to be excessive in relation to
the railway's long-term role. The net result has been a lack of a blue-print



for long-term transport development systematically related to the country's
resource base and developing demand for transport services, a concentration
on high cost projects, and a lack of adequate thought to execution of major
projects in stages.
1.22      The absence of a master plan for infrastructure development is parti-
cularly noticeable in the Douala-Yaounde corridor. In mid-1977 a feasibility
study of transport improvements in the corridor, carried out under the Second
and Third Railway projects, demonstrated that a combination of partial railway
realignment with road upgrading to paved standard would be the economically
optimal solution. However, because of a combination of factors caused by
unusually bad weather in 1976, the Government pressed for the immediate con-
struction of a four-lane expressway instead of a two-lane paved road.  After
protracted discussions with the Bank, the Government agreed to limit its
first stage plans for highway investment in the corridor to a two-lane road,
though on a different alignment and at a higher cost than that featured in the
corridor study calculations. The proposed road is the subject of an ongoing
feasibility study. The proposal assumes donor funds will be available to
enable the Government to award several contracts simultaneously, commence work
in 1980 and finish in 1982 or 1983.
1.23      At the same time, as a result of discussions between the Government
and the Bank on proposals for realignment of the mountainous Edea-Maloume
section of the railway (122 km), the Office du Chemin de Fer Transcamerounais
(OCFT), responsible for railway construction, has prepared draft terms of
reference for an updated study and requested Bank comments. The Bank's
response has suggested expansion of the study to examine all feasible alterna-
tives to full realignment and to ensure that all relevant economic factors
(including the construction of the Douala-Yaounde road) are taken into con-
sideration. The Government agreed during negotiations that it will carry out
a study to determine the optimal economic solution for improving the Edea-
Maloume section and will not undertake any capital investment on this rail
section, unless it is economically justified. As requested by the Government,
a letter outlining the recommended methodology for the above study has been
sent to the Government.
1.24      If the Douala-Yaounde road is built according to the timetable noted
in para. 1.22, the full force of road competition will be felt by the railway
before the railway has had time to reestablish consumer confidence in its
ability to provide efficient and reliable service as a result of the substan-
tial investment already underway (including the proposed project). The
economic and financial analyses contained in this report fully reflect these
pessimistic assumptions.
1.25      Forestry development is critical to the justification of the pro-
posed project and in the wider context of southern and southeastern Cameroon
development. A two-phase study on forestry transport requirements financed
under the Second Highway Project was recently completed and is being reviewed
by the Government and the Bank. The main conclusion is that a lack of trans-
port is the major reason why Cameroon forestry development has failed to



expand rapidly in recent years. The Bank forestry sector review mission
which recently visited Cameroon concluded that, in addition, Government policy
on development of the sector was unclear and this uncertainty was an inhibit-
ing factor on growth of production. The Government has decided in principle
to appoint a forestry economist to advise on policy matters but no appointment
has yet been maue. Successful progress on both transport and policy aspects
will be necessary to achieve a satisfactory forestry development policy, and
the Bank will continue to monitor progress.
II. REGIFERCAM
A.   Organization and Management
2.01      Regifercam is a public sector corporation functioning under Gov-
ernnent guidelines as stipulated in a 1974 presidential decree. The Board
of Directors consists of twelve members, mostly Government representatives,
including the corporation's general manager as chairman.  The board has
the dual function of implementing Government policy and supervising the
railway's management which is headed by the general manager and two deputy
general managers, all appointed by presidential decree. Regifercam operates
with a reasonable degree of independence in its day-to-day operations.
2.02      Regifercam's internal organization (Chart 1) has undergone several
changes in recent years and is now satisfactory in its essential features.
The railway has succeeded in finding Cameroonians for its entire top and
middle management, with the exception of one deputy general manager. The
quality of management has improved, due inter alia to technical assistance
provided under two preceding Bank projects and by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA). There remain, however, critical areas of organ-
izational and personnel weakness. Substantial technical assistance and
management training has, therefore, been included in the proposed project, in
particular in the fields of planning and control and through the establishment
and staffing of Organization and Methods Units in the technical departments.
B.   Staff and Training
2.03      Regifercam's total staff increased considerably (34%) over the
past five years, stabilizing in 1978 at about 5,200 employees. While this
increase in staff was partly justified by the opening in 1974 of the last
section of the Transcameroon line (293 km) and has remained below the in-
crease in traffic units (passenger-km and ton-km), productivity is rather
low (less than 170,000 traffic units per employee) 1/. No conditions on
staffing were included in previous loan agreements. To control this tendency
1/   Excluding staff working under investment budget and trainees.



- 8 -
to overstaffing, following Bank recommendations made on several occasions,
Regifercam is preparing a manpower plan with the assistance of consultants
Canadian Pacific Consulting Services (CPCS), under CIDA financing, and
Organisation, Reconstruction, Travail (ORT, Switzerland), under Bank financ-
ing. The primary objectives of this plan are to determine numbers of rail-
way staff proportionate to the actual operational needs and ensure a better
matching of job requirements and staff qualifications. The railway agreed
during negotiations to submit the draft plan to the Bank for review by
June 30, 1980, to implement it over a five-year period after this review,
to submit to the Bank annual progress reports, and to limit any staff in-
crease to what is absolutely necessary for railway operations until the plan
is finalized. Regifercam's staffing over the past six years is shown in the
table below.

2.04      Present technical assistance provided by OFERMAT (France) is
generally good, both at the level of the Deputy General Manager for Studies,
who is an experienced railway engineer, and at the middle supervisory level.
However, there is a lack of adequate support at the management level in the
main technical departments and the project's technical assistance component
is designed to overcome this weakness. Regifercam agreed during negotiations
to consult annually with the Bank on the railway's expected technical assis-
tance requirements and on measures necessary to meet them.



- 9 -
2.05      The railway has had a formal training program since 1952.  Bank
reviews of Regifercam's training problems in 1975 and 1977 showed that its
training program needed to be revised. Under the Third Railway Project,
Regifercam appointed consultants (ORT) who designed a training component for
the proposed project.
2.06      ORT's tasks included the following:
(a) manpower inventory;
(b)  job descriptions (jointly with CPCS's team);
(c)  recommendations for the organization of the personnel,
training and psychology divisions;
(d) quantitative and qualitative evaluation of recruitment
and training needs;
(e) appraisal of the resources to be made available to the
training division and to be included in the proposed
project;
(f)  work program for the setting up of a training scheme and
the organization of a training department; and
(g) recommendations for curricula.
2.07      The design of the training component of the proposed project is
based on ORT's report, dated November 1978, which calls for the retraining of
about 50% of Regifercam's staff and for the hiring and training of about 200
new recruits annually in two-year courses, mostly to replace staff leaving
the railway. It provides for the improvement of the existing Douala training
facilities with some new construction, the purchase of furniture and training
equipment and material, and the provision of technical assistance (194 man-
months) to finalize the design of the training programs and start their imple-
mentation, to initiate the proposed reorganization of the railway training
division, to assist the railway in improving staff recruitment and management,
and to train counterparts who are to take over the management of all railway
training activities after the end of the implementation phase. On the basis
of the consultants' preliminary recommendations, improvements in staff manage-
ment techniques, mainly through rationalizing the hiring system and
reducing the present high level of absenteeism, will be instituted by
the railway during 1979 (para 3.17(c)). Regifercam recently introduced
psychotechnic methods to improve the selection of candidates, particularly for
jobs where safety is at stake, which have already produced useful results.



- 10 -
2.08      The most urgent need of the railway is a substantial improvement
in operations and management control with emphasis on the training of
key personnel of the various departments of the organization. The formal
vocational training scheme for managerial skills executed by the railway
in 1978 is not sufficient to achieve this goal and must be complemented by
daily on-the-job training which is, in fact, the main objective of the tech-
nical assistance component of the proposed project (para. 3.17(b)).
2.09      A detailed review of Regifercam's training problems and of the Bank's
involvement in training during the previous Cameroon railway projects is con-
tained in the project file.
C.  Accounts, Costing, Budgets and Audit
2.10      Regifercam's financial statements are in general based on sound
accounting principles, conforming to procedures recommended by the Organization
Commune des Etats Africains et Malgache (OCAM). Valuation and depreciation of
assets are discussed later in this report (para. 5.05). Cost accounting was
introduced several years ago under the Bank's Second Railway Project, and the
costing system has since been considerably improved. Assisted by consultants
financed under the Third Railway Project (SOFRERAIL, France), a new plan
of accounts has been introduced and the costing system is expected to produce
detailed and reliable results for FY1980. The proposed project provides for
continuation of ongoing technical assistance in this field and the railway has
appointed qualified counterparts.
2.11      Regifercam prepares an annual operating budget, entitled "Forecast
Operating Account", which is a sufficiently detailed and thoroughly prepared
document containing an annex on capital investment to be financed from the
railway's own resources. However, a comprehensive investment budget does
not exist. Regifercam has agreed to:
(a)  produce, beginning with FY1981, a comprehensive investment
budget and a corresponding financing plan covering all
railway-related investment irrespective of the source of
financing; and
(b)  submit, beginning FY1980, its draft operating and investment
budgets to the Bank for review at least 30 days before con-
sideration by Regifercam's board, but in any event not later
than one month before the beginning of the fiscal year covered
by the budget. The same will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any
amendments to the original investment budget proposed to be
made during the year.
2.12      Medium- and long-term planning, including technical and economic
studies, and budgeting and control are the principal functions of the deputy
general manager for studies. The organizational framework is reasonable, but
there is a shortage of qualified manpower. Technical assistance in this area



- il -
is being financed under the Third Railway Project and its continuation has
been included in the proposed project. In September 1978, Regifercam provided
two qualified counterparts and is expected to provide one or two more as
needed during 1979. The railway is presently instituting a formal budget
control system for all operating expenses, giving a monthly comparison of
actual versus budgeted expenses per type of expense and department and estab-
lishing rules for dealing with budget overruns. A report, covering execution
of the budget during the first four months of FY1979, was submitted to the
Bank and shows satisfactory progress in implementing the system.
2.13      A department for internal audit was recently instituted and a
director appointed. Additional staffing is underway. The railway's accounts
have been audited by a Government-appointed "Commissaire aux Comptes" whose
reports, however, have not reflected adequate auditing standards. The rail-
way signed a contract with auditors acceptable to the Bank for the FY1978
audit and agreed to submit to the Bank, not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year, a report by auditors acceptable to the Bank.
D.   Property
2.14      A description of railway track, structures, equipment, and other
property is presented in Annex 2, tables 1 to 3, and Chart 2.
Track and Signalling
2.15      The railway had 1,170 km of main line in 1977.  The realignment of
the Yaounde-Maloume section (102 km), put into service in April 1978, shortened
the distance between Douala and Yaounde by 17 km. The realignment of the
Douala-Edea section (84 km), which started at the end of 1978 (under financing
from KfW, FED, CCCE, FAC, CIDA and USAID), will result in a further reduction
of 13 km by 1981. The track on the Yaounde-Ngaoundere section (completed in
1974), was built to high technical standards and is in good condition. Between
Douala and Yaounde, the Douala-Edea section needs a complete track renewal,
which will be carried out during the realignment, and the Maloume-Yaounde
section is new. The middle section (Edea-Maloume) is being partly rehabili-
tated by Regifercam's own forces using salvaged material. The works consist
of the replacement of concrete sleepers with steel sleepers on a 42 km zone
(km 103 to km 145), continuation of the replacement of 30 kg rails on about
11 km between Edea and Makondo (km 104), and important subgrade repairs on a
dozen spots scattered along the whole section. On 38 km of the Western line,
between Nlohe and Nkongsamba, rails are very old (German 20-kg rails) and
their replacement with salvaged 26-kg and 30-kg rails is planned for 1979-80.
2.16      A sophisticated new multiplex communication system was put into
service in December 1978 between Douala and Yaounde with six interconnected
automatic telephone exchanges and a telex network. This system is supple-
mented by physical safety circuits using traditional technology. An elec-
trical signalling system will be installed in the stations between Douala
and Yaounde starting in October 1979 under CCCE financing coupled with a



- 12 -
suppliers' credit.  This system is to be completed by October 1981 and also
provides for remote control of switches. Properly maintained, the new com-
munication and signalling systems will enable Regifercam to improve sub-
stantially its operations on the Douala-Yaounde line.
Rolling Equipment
Transport Capacity
2.17      The previous Bank projects provided for the purchase of necessary
motive power and rolling stock to meet traffic requirements and replace
obsolete equipment. The locomotives and rolling stock were sufficient to cope
with traffic demand for the planned period, i.e. through FY1977. In December
1976, railway management and the Bank calculated that additional boxcars and
gondolas were needed to increase the transport capacity of the railway, and
Regifercam ordered 160 boxcars and 50 gondolas under CCCE financing. This
equipment has been delivered. In December 1977, Regifercam and the Bank once
again reassessed the need for additional motive power and rolling stock.
This led Regifercam to request financial assistance from CIDA and SEE for
the purchase of 20 mainline locomotives of the 2000-HP range, 150 flat cars
for timber, 240 boxcars and 60 gondolas.  This equipment is expected to be
delivered in 1979-80. The identification of the needs was made in time but
delays in securing financing and in delivery have resulted in the transport
capacity shortage now being encountered.
Locomotives
2.18      At the end of 1978, Regifercam had 47 mainline locomotives, 9 rail-
cars and 31 shunters (Annex 2, Table 1). Of this fleet, three 12- to 13-year
old CC-2400 locomotives will be withdrawn from service on the main line,
because they are too costly to maintain and have numerous breakdowns. Of the
15 older locomotives of the class BB-300/500, 10 are 23 years old but still
in good condition and these locomotives will be used on the Western line or
for service trains and shorthaul passenger trains. In FY1980, with the
addition of 20 Canadian mainline locomotives (CC-2200), Regifercam will have
73 mainline locomotives 1/ of which 58 or 79% are less than 10 years old.
This is a substantial increase both in number of units and hauling capacity
(55%) and the average age of the mainline motive power will be considerably
less than it was in 1977 (7 years against 13 in 1977). The railcars are
rather old but Regifercam intends to develop a passenger transport plan which
will provide for more passenger trains to be hauled by locomotives of the
class BB-1200 and also by BB-900 locomotives which are being delivered.
2.19      The average shunter age is about 10 years (31 units).  Heavy train
shunting will be carried out by some of the new BB-900 locomotives, the light
shunting work being performed by about 20 existing 400 HP shunters whose
useful life can be expected to extend beyond 1985.
1/   This total includes the BB-900 locomotives which will be used for both
light mainline service and heavy shunting in the main marshalling yards.



- 13 -
Passenger Rolling Stock
2.20      Out of a total of 91 passenger coaches, about 25 are nearly 30
years old, and 15 to 20 of these should soon be written off. On the basis
of the Bank's passenger traffic forecasts for FY1981 and past statistics, the
purchase of twelve second-class passenger coaches of large capacity (88 seats)
would be necessary. However, Regifercam is seeking bilateral aid for the
purchase of 31 passenger coaches, including about 11 first-class units. In
January 1979, the railway submitted to the Bank a passenger transport plan,
as requested by the appraisal mission. This plan provides for: (i) the re-
duction of passenger service on the Western line, including the closing of
stations with very low traffic, and (ii) the improvement of ticket inspection
along the line and in the stations. These measures are being implemented. In
addition, the plan calls for the renewal of 20 second-class passenger coaches
which are obsolete. The mission feels that this number is overestimated and
the issue is under discussion with Regifercam's management.
Freight Cars
2.21      As detailed in Annex 2, Table 3, at the end of 1978, of a total of
1,541 freight cars, 332 are due to be written off. In 1978/79, 160 boxcars,
50 gondolas and 2 well wagons were delivered under CCCE financing, assembled
in Douala and put into service. Additionally, the railway plans to buy with
Canadian financing 150 80T flatcars (timber), 240 boxcars and 60 gondolas. In
1980, the number of freight cars will therefore be increased by about 20% and
the load capacity of the fleet by 40%, since 40T boxcars and gondolas will
replace old 20/30T cars and the 80T timber flatcars will more than offset 110
30T flatcars due to be scrapped. The total capacity of the fleet was about
56,600 tons at the end of 1978 and will be about 79,000 tons in 1980.
Service Vehicles
2.22      Regifercam has 15 service coaches for inspection, on-the-job train-
ing along the line and breakdown trains, and 144 service freight cars used
mainly by the Permanent Way and Mechanical Departments. Most of these
vehicles are old but have limited use and hence are adequate for this purpose.
2.23      In summary, the railway has maintained its infrastructure assets
well by timely renewal. However, it has given less priority to its capacity
requirements, particularly in the last one or two years, with the result that
there has been a tendency for demand to exceed capacity. This problem is
being rectified. As future rolling stock requirements should be evaluated
on the basis of the actual condition of existing equipment, Regifercam sub-
mitted to the Bank, in March 1979, such an evaluation with forecasts of
equipment to be written off and proposed measures for the rehabilitation of
disabled vehicles. The evaluation is being reviewed and will be discussed
with Regifercam during coming supervision missions.
E.   Operations
2.24      A summary of operating statistics (1973-1978) is presented in
Annex 2, Table 4.



- 14 -
2.25      In general, operations have improved slightly over the past five
years, but the efficiency indices are still on the low side. The availabil-
ity of motive power is slightly under 75%. The average gross load per freight
train has not increased sign'ficantly despite the introduction of more power-
ful locomotives (4B-3600).  Wagon turnaround time has not improved remaining
at about 11 days. Operations are badly hampered by numerous incidents and
accidents, such as derailments on the main line (44 per year in 1976-78), in
the stations and spurs (284 per year in 1976-78), and rail breakages (242 per
year), causing traffic stoppages and train delays. This situation is expected
to improve slightly with the opening to traffic of the realigned Maloume-
Yaounde section and the introduction of better communications, but the basic
problems are still poor operational management, mainly in the Operations and
the Mechanical departments, lack of discipline, and inadequate staff training
or retraining schemes.
2.26      Due to cost overruns on the previous projects, mainly on the con-
struction of the Japoma bridge, management assistance programs provided under
these projects were delayed and transferred to the Third Railway Project.
During the implementation of the Management Study under the latter, remedial
actions were undertaken in the DOT and MT Departments, where critical weak-
nesses had been identified. In the DOT Department, better systems for moni-
toring motive power and for rolling stock management and utilization were
introduced and the railway safety regulations were revised with the assistance
of the consultants. In the MT Department, new maintenance rules and proce-
dures have also been defined, and the consultants are training staff to
implement these new procedures under a separate contract financed by CCCE
which should be completed by the end of 1980. Although some noticeable
results have been obtained, particularly in terms of locomotive availability
and number of locomotive failures, it is clear that much remains to be done
to bring railway operations to satisfactory standards of efficiency.
Plan of Action
2.27      A plan of action to improve operations was submitted to the Bank
by Regifercam's management and agreed upon during negotiations. The plan
indicates the operational targets they will try to achieve during the next
four years and enumerates the means by which the plan of action will be
implemented. The plan of action was incorporated in the Loan Agreement.
Management Assistance
2.28      Actions undertaken by consultants SOFRERAIL under the Third Railway
Project to improve railway management and operations were not as successful
as expected. This was due to several factors including:
(a) the lack of counterparts for the consultants' experts;
(b) the railway's failure to promptly implement feasible
physical improvements to the facilities recommended by
SOFRERAIL;



- 15 -
(c)  the inadequacy of the maintenance facilities for rolling
equipment to permit immediate substantial improvements; and
(d)  the consultants' tendency to concentrate on actions aimed
only at limited improvements of existing methods and proce-
dures, due chiefly to the lack of qualified counterparts.
In the DOT and MT departments, the work of the SOFRERAIL experts under the
Third Railway Project was completed by mid-1978, except for short follow-up
missions performed later. SOFRERAIL's final report on these activities was
received at the end of 1978 and was used in finalizing the technical assis-
tance component of the proposed project (para. 3.17).
F.   Traffic
Background
2.29      In recent years, a shortage of motive power and rolling stock has
limited Cameroon Railways ability to meet traffic demands, particularly those
for cement and timber.  This has led to suppression of traffic estimated by
the railway as equivalent to about 15% of current demand. This will be over-
come by locomotives and rolling stock being delivered in FYs 1979-1980.
However, the railway is unable to marshall wagons efficiently and to service
locomotives punctually. The impact of these deficiencies would increase
substantially as traffic grew if appropriate investments were not made to
increase marshalling and service capacity. The project will ensure that this
capacity will become available as soon as possible and will be in service
during FY1982.
Traffic Analysis
2.30      During the Third Plan (FYs1972-76) GDP grew at less than 3% p.a.
*compared with over 7% p.a. during the Second Plan.  Improved agricultural
producer prices and the effects of a substantial increase in investment
in the mid-1970's should enable a GDP growth rate of about 6% p.a. to occur
during the 1980s. Railway freight traffic, which grew by nearly 9% p.a.
from FY1974 to FY1978, should increase by a further 7% through FY1979 despite
continued weakness in timber traffic (Annex 2, Table 5).
Passenger Traffic
2.31      Transcameroon passenger traffic increased sharply in FY1975 after
completion of the line to Ngaoundere. Since then it has been virtually
static.  However, Regifercam believes that due to fare avoidance the statis-
tics under-record the number of passengers actually carried and steps are
being taken to eliminate this. Western line passenger traffic has declined
mainly as a result of increased road competition, in turn partially due to
road improvements.

2.32      Freight traffic forecasts are based upon the following:
(a) a best estimate which reflects the improved prospects for the
Cameroon economy (para 2.30) and the fact that during the course
of FY1979 thru FY1982 Regifercam will be provided with substan-
tial additional capacity in the form of motive power, rolling
stock, and the wagon marshalling and locomotive repair facili-
ties provided under the proposed project;
(b) a sensitivity estimate which takes into consideration (i) the
uncertainties regarding the prospects for major Cameroonian exports,
in particular timber, discussed below; (ii) the possibility that
the economies of neighboring countries, in particular Chad, which
generate demand for rail services, will perform poorly, and (iii)
the operational shortcomings of Regifercam which will take some
time to overcome. The sensitivity analysis assumptions could well
be realized and consequently they are given particular attention
in the economie and financial analyses.
Best Freight Traffic Estimate FY1979 to FY1983
2.33      An increase of about 41% in total freight tonnage is expected
(Annex 2, Table 6). This is mainly accounted for by five commodities:
timber, construction materials, aluminium/alumina, petroleum and traffic from
the new paper mill scheduled to commence operations at Edea in FY1981. The
forecast timber traffic increase is compatible with short-term demand projec-
tions made by logging companies, and indeed it is widely believed that railway
timber traffic could be increased to about 600,000 tons per annum given ade-
quate railway capacity.  The demand for transport of construction materials
reflects an increasing requirement for cement in north Cameroon and Chad,
supplied by Cameroon's main cement works at Douala, which is currently being
expanded from a capacity of 330,000 tons p.a. to 1,115,000 tons by 1984. The



- 17 -
increase in petroleum traffic is largely accounted for by the opening of a
new depot at N'Gaoundere which will result in substitution of rail transport
for road transport via Bafoussam. The increase in alumina/aluminium transport
will result from expansion of Alucam production under an IFC project presented
to the board in April 1979.
Freight Traffic Growth after FY1983
2.34      Construction of the Douala-Yaounde road to heavy duty paved standard
could begin in late 1980, with a construction period of two or three years.
The alignment envisaged is some 15% shorter than that suggested by SOFRERAIL/
OCCR (about 230 km compared with 273 km), due to prospective adoption of an
alignment on the Douala-Edea section reducing this distance to about 65 km.
As a result, the Douala-Yaounde transit time by truck can be expected to be
reduced to about three hours. Under these circumstances, railway traffic
is likely to decline during the first year in which the road is open (assumed
FY1984) and subsequently to be increasingly confined to long-distance bulk
and semi-bulk commodities. Thus total traffic will probably not recover to
the FY1983 tonnage until about FY1988. Beyond FY1988, growth of railway
traffic is likely to resume at a rate largely determined by economic growth
in north Cameroon, Chad and CAE and the growth of timber traffic from the
Belabo area. A trend rate of 3% p.a. for timber and 2% p.a. for other freight
traffic is forecast for FYs1988-2001. Traffic growth characteristics for the
main commodity groups are analyzed below.
Timber
2.35      Regifercam's timber tonnage is forecast to increase by over 50%
between FY1979 and FY1983. The FY1983 forecast is well below those produced
by consultants Centre Technique Forestier Tropical, Paris ("Etude des Trans-
ports Forestiers", December 1978). However, growth of production has been
slow in recent years and a cautious approach is therefore appropriate. The
establishment of additional sawmilling capacity at Belabo should increase the
ratio of processed timber to log traffic on the railway to about one-third
(log equivalent), compared to about one-fourth in recent years. After FY1983
road competition is expected to divert some timber traffic but as Regifercam
sources will be to a large degree concentrated on Belabo, which is not served
by road, a further slow growth in timber traffic is expected.

Agricultural Exports
2.36      Agricultural exports are forecast to increase in volume by 50%
between FY1979 and 1983. This primarily reflects greater cocoa production
through producer price increases, further growth in cotton traffic, expansion
of sugar refinery capacity at Mbandjok (Km 389), and increased oil seed
production.
Miscellaneous Southbound Traffic
2.37      This category includes return packaging, miscellaneous agricultural
products and a small volume of semi-finished goods mainly from north Cameroon.
The total volume is likely to grow about the same rate as GDP.
Paper Products and Alumina/Aluminum
2.38      Production is expected to commence at the Cellucam plant near Edea
in FY1981. Under the most favorable circumstances full production of about
120,000 tons p.a. could be achieved by FY1985; however, a more modest forecast
of 100,000 tons is employed in view of possible delays in reaching full capac-
ity. Alumina/aluminum traffic should increase to about 260,000 tons p.a. as
a result of Alucam expansion (para. 2.33).
Other Traffic
2.39      Other traffic is forecast to increase by about 10% between FY1979
and FY1983. This is a much slower rate than experienced from FY1973 to FY1978,
but a conservative approach is adopted in view of (a) uncertainty about the
rate of growth of construction, which will determine the volume of cement
traffic; and (b) the probability that northbound general freight traffic will
expand less sharply than in recent years when food imports substituted for
domestic crop production, which was adversely affected by weather conditions.

Sensitivity Freight Traffic Estimate FY1979 to FY1983
2.40      The sensitivity forecast calls for a growth in traffic about half
the best estimate rate and about two-thirds of that recorded in the period
of slow economic growth since FY1974.  A major feature of this sensitivity



- 19 -
analysis is the assumption that if paper and aluminium/alumina traffic, for
which future production and traffic levels are known with a high degree of
precision, are excluded, no increase in tonnage is predicted. However an
increase in the average distance and thus ton-km should occur as Regifercam
concentrates increasingly upon long haul traffic, particularly of timber.
The growth in ton-km for freight traffic excluding aluminium/alumina and paper
would be about 5% p.a. compared with over 8% during the previous five years
(Annex 2, Table 7).
Passenger Traffic Forecast
2.41      Passenger traffic is expected to continue to grow slowly until the
Douala-Yaounde road is paved. Thereafter, railway passenger traffic could
decline sharply as the difference between the transit time by road and rail
widens sharply -- by road it could be reduced to under three hours, well
under half the time than by rail. During the road construction period, it
would be reasonable to expect some detrimental effect on rail passenger
traffic. Thus the timing of road development is critical to the traffic
forecasts below, which assume road construction beginning FY1981 and being
substantially completed by FY1983.
2.42      Passenger traffic, in fact, has little bearing on the project.
The need for marshalling facilities is independent of it, while only 14%
of the demand for workshops/sheds will be attributable to passenger operations
in FY1983. Project benefits are, therefore, virtually insensitive to the
accuracy of passenger traffic projections.

III.  THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   Regifercam's Investment Plan
3.01      Regifercam's Investment Plan and the corresponding financing
plan (cf. Annex 2, Tables 14 and 15) cover FYs1979-81 and are part of the



- 20 -
Government's national plan. Forecasts for the years until FY1985 have been
established and discussed with Regifercam for the purpose of this report.
Regifercam's planning function is being strengthened under the third project,
and the proposed project provides for continuation of the corresponding
technical assistance (para 2.11).
3.02      Total railway investment planned for the three-year period amounts
to CFAF 45.9 billion ($209 million). It focusses on:
(a) providing sufficient transport capacity to meet expected
demand;
(b) upgrading and modernizing existing infrastructure; and
(c) improving operational efficiency.
3.03      The investment plan is, in general, well balanced and adequate to
achieve the above objectives. Most components are economically well justified.
The justification for the planned purchase of passenger coaches for an estimated
CFAF 2.4 billion is, however, not obvious and is being studied in more detail
by the railway before making a decision. This decision will be subject to the
Bank's approval under existing and proposed covenants.
3.04      Financing of the essential items, including the proposed project,
has been secured or is in an advanced stage of negotiations. Financing of
the passenger coaches and the planned new Douala passenger station building
has not yet been secured, but is under discussion between the railway and
potential donors (Japan, France, and African Development Bank (AfDB)).
B. The Project
Background
3.05      Freight traffic will increase by one third from FY1979 to FY1982.
There will be sufficient line capacity to carry forecast traffic and the
capacity of the port of Douala is being almost doubled under the Second Port
Project. However the following constraints exist:
(a) motive power and rolling stock capacity is insufficient
and old equipment must be renewed;
(b) marshalling and auxiliary facilities in Douala must be
relocated and their capacity increased;
(c) maintenance capacity for locomotives, rolling stock and
track maintenance equipment must be adjusted to handle
higher traffic volumes; and
(d) efficiency of both operations and management needs improvement.
France and Canada are financing needed locomotives and freight cars. The
proposed project is designed to resolve the other constraints by financing
selected major items included in the railway investment plan.



- 21 -
3.06      The project comprises five main components:  (a) the new Douala
marshalling yard including the infrastructure of a passenger station, (b) the
provision of railway equipment, (c) the expansion of the workshops and the
construction of the new maintenance facilities at Yaounde, (d) the provision
of technical assistance for improvements in operations and management, and
consulting services for feasibility and engineering studies and works super-
vision, and (e) training.
Objectives
3.07      The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to increase the capacity and the efficiency of the traffic
handling facilities of the Douala area by grouping in one
central location all the operations now carried out in four
different stations, in order to meet the needs until 1985
and provide potential for further capacity increases at low
marginal cost;
(b)  to provide Regifercam with adequate locomotive and rolling
stock maintenance facilities to enable it to handle the
additional equipment being procured;
(c)  to improve the efficiency of management and operations through
management assistance for the administrative and technical
departments, including preparation of further workshop expan-
sion possibly needed after 1982;
(d)  to assist the railway in buying locomotive spare parts and
railway equipment (mainly track maintenance equipment, turn-
outs, bogies and machine tools and equipment for the railway
workshops); and
(e)  to improve and expand training facilities and to provide
technical assistance to reorganize the Training Department
and improve training programs.
Engineering Aspects
3.08      The final engineering of the new Douala station was carried out
with Bank financing by consultants:
(a)  SOCOTEC-CECOBA (France-Cameroon) for the main civil works;
(b)  TRANSURB CONSULT (Belgium) for the signaling and public-
address system; and
(c)  SCET International (France) for the road bridge.
Cost estimates, implementation schedule and tender documents were included
in the consultants' work, which was finished by March 1979.



- 22 -
3.09      The engineering studies for the railway workshop expansion are
being carried out by consultants SOCOTEC-CECOBA on the basis of a master plan
approved by the Bank after review by an experienced independent consultant
hired by the Bank. Completion of these studies is expected by September 1979.
3.10      A preliminary design for the Yaounde locomotive running shed and
rolling stock maintenance facilities was prepared by a consultant financed
by Regifercam and reviewed by the Bank in May 1979. The proposed maintenance
regime to be instituted in these new facilities complies with the Bank's
recommendations. The final engineering will also be done by SOCOTEC-CECOBA.
The engineering, including the preparation of the tender documents, is
expected to be completed by December 1979.
3.11      The scope and design of the training component have been defined by
consultants ORT (Switzerland) under Bank financing and supervision.
Description
The New Douala Marshalling Yard
3.12      The new Douala marshalling yard includes:
(a) a marshalling yard with 2 sets of tracks for freight traffic
and a rail bridge for access to the workshops and maintenance
facilities;
(b)  a platform and surfaced areas for cargo-handling, including
required service sidings;
(c) a warehouse and its service tracks;
(d) a wagon maintenance shed;
(e)  various service buildings and fixed installations;
(f) internal service roads and parking areas;
(g) a passenger station with tracks and platforms (excluding the
passenger station building, its access and parking areas);
(h) a set of tracks for servicing and parking passenger coaches;
(i) a public road connection to the freight station and yard; and
(j) a road bridge to replace the present level-crossing on the
busy Douala-Yaounde road (an overhead crossing above 10 tracks
of the new marshalling yard sidings).



- 23 -
Regifercam agreed during negotiations to make arrangements by December 31,
1980, to build an adequate passenger station building and related facilities.
Annex 1 describes the main features and merits of these new Douala traffic
handling facilities. Map IBRD 14059 shows the location of the main railway
facilities in the Douala area.
Railway Equipment
3.13      The railway equipment to be included in the project comprises:
(a)  track maintenance equipment, mainly for renewal:  5 gang-cars
with trailers, 2 inspection cars, 1 test rail car, and 1
small mechanical road-rail diesel shovel;
(b)  50 turnouts, half for renewal and half for new service
sidings, and about 75 turnouts necessary for the new Douala
station and marshalling yard;
(c)  50 bogies to replace those damaged in accidents;
(d)  a truck equipped with pump and hoses for the fire department;
(e)  machine tools, test, cleaning and lifting equipment for the
workshop; and
(f)  locomotive spare parts.
Douala Workshop Expansion
3.14      The workshop expansion comprises:
(a)  the civil works which include:
(i)  the expa sion of the diesel locomotive workshop
(1,215 m );
(ii) the construction of a storage building for major
locomotive spare parts and assemblies (bogie frames,
wheels, traction2motors, diesel engines, main gene-
rators) (1,250 m );
(iii) the construction of a cleaning plant for locomotive
bogies and heavy spare parts;
(iv)  the construction of a workshop for maintenan e and
repair of track maintenance machinery (810 m );



- 24 -
(v) the construction of a platform for locomotive cleaning;
(vi)  the construction of an additional2storage building for
spare parts and supplies (2,000 m );
(vii) the constructton of an office for the general railway
stores (650 m )9
(viii) the construction of a new locomotive testing facility
with sufficient capacity for the most powerful mainline
locomotives (3600 HP);
(ix) necessary drainage improvements and extension of the
utility networks (compressed air, gas, water, elec-
tricity); and
(x) the extension of the service tracks.
(b)  the construction of a service station in the vicinity of the 3
new Douala marshalling yard, with refueling facilities (150 m
storage tank).
This workshop expansion is the first phase of the implementation of a master
plan proposed by the railway and is deemed sufficient to meet traffic and
maintenance requirements until at least 1982. Further workshop expansion
will depend on the results of a feasibility study to be undertaken under the
project. The general layout of the first phase of the workshop expansion is
shown in Map IBRD 14060.
Yaounde Locomotive Running Shed
3.15      A complete locomotive running shed will be constructed in two phases
in Yaounde to perform the running maintenance of all the diesel locomotives
operating on the Transcameroon railway, both mainline and shunting locomotives.
The first phase has been included in the proposed project and is designed for
the maintenance of 50 mainline locomotives, railcars and shunters. The
present Yaounde service station, which is located in the Yaounde marshalling
yard, will be re-arranged to accommodate these 50 units.
Yaounde Rolling Stock Maintenance Facilities
3.16      A workshop will be constructed in Yaounde for routine checks and
maintenance of freight cars and passenger coaches. This will enable the
railway to postpone the construction of new freight car workshops until
the studies financed under the project are completed (para. 3.17(e)).
Operations and Management Assistance and Supervision of Works
3.17      The proposed project includes 306 man-months of consulting services
and technical assistance for the improvement of railway operations and man-
agement, and, additionally, feasibility and engineering studies for the



- 25 -
construction of maintenance facilities provided for in the project, the
preparation of possible further workshop expansion and the supervision
of the works under the contracts. These components will comprise:
(a) continuation of the actions undertaken under the Third
Railway Project, to strengthen the office of the deputy
general manager for studies, who is responsible for plan-
ning and budgeting, technical, economic and financial
studies, statistics and computerization;
(b) setting up of Organization and Methods Units, one of which
is to be attached to each of the main technical departments
of the railway, namely Mechanical Engineering (M.T.), Oper-
ations (DOT) and Permanent Way (V.B.T.); Regifercam agreed
during negotiations to institute these units by December
31, 1979 on terms acceptable to the Bank and to provide
Cameroonian counterparts of adequate number and qualifica-
tions for the technical assistants provided for these units
under the proposed project;
(c) finalization of the railway's manpower plan (para 2.03)
and implementation of improved personnel management tech-
niques (para 2.07) will require, respectively, 9 and 15
additional man-months of technical assistance for which
funds have been provided in the proposed project. Retro-
active financing for these two components in the amount
of up to US$200,000 was agreed upon during negotiations
to prevent interruption of on-going works;
(d) final engineering studies for the construction of the
Yaounde locomotive running shed and rolling stock main-
tenance facilities for which Regifercam requested retroactive
financing in the amount of up to US$150,000, which is necessary
to avoid delay in the preparation of this project element;
(e) feasibility and engineering studies for the second phase
of the workshop expansion; and
(f) supervision of the works under contracts provided for in
the project.
Parts (a) and (b), to be carried out by consultants and technical assistants
within three years, are aimed at improving management procedures and training
of national counterparts. The technical assistants appointed to the Organiza-
tion and Methods Units will be closely involved in day-to-day operations.
Training
3.18      The training component comprises:  furniture, equipment and
material; the renovation of existing buildings and the addition of class-
rooms and offices; and 194 man-months of technical assistance to strengthen



- 26 -
the training department of the railway, to develop an improved training
scheme based on manpower planning, to train supervisory training staff
and instructors and to implement the recommendations of the training study
performed by the consultants ORT.
Refinancing of Loan S4-CM
3.19      US$2 million is provided in the proposed loan to refinance the
non-repaid portion of the engineering loan of the Third Railway Project.
C. Cost Estimates
3.20      The total cost of the proposed project, net of tax, is estimated
at US$57.2 million equivalent, with foreign costs of about US$45.4 million
(79%). Cameroonian legislation exempts construction works undertaken by
Regifercam on the Transcameroon line from taxes and duties. A breakdown of
project costs based on end-1978 prices is shown below.

3.21      Physical contingencies are estimated as follows:  for the new Douala
station, earthworks 15%, bridges 12%, and other works 10%; workshop expansion
15%; training equipment, material, furniture and buildings 10%; consulting
services and technical assistance 15%; and engineering studies 10%. The
estimates of price contingencies are assessed at 10% p.a. for equipment, civil
works and services during the project implementation period.
3.22      The total cost per man-month of technical assistance and consulting
services is estimated at US$9,970 excluding contingencies. This estimate is
based on actual costs of contracts awarded under the Third Railway Project and
includes all reimbursable expenses.
Financing
3.23      The proposed project would be financed by an IDA credit of US$20
million and a Bank loan of US$27 million, including refinancing of the non-
repaid portion of Loan S4-CM (US$2.0 million), the balance being provided
by Regifercam (US$11.8 million equivalent in local costs and US$0.4 million
equivalent in foreign costs for locomotive spare parts). Total retroactive
financing of up to US$350,000 is proposed (para. 3.17 (c) and (d)).
D. Project Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
Execution
3.24      Regifercam is competent to carry out and supervise the project with
the assistance of consulting engineers. The project is expected to start in
October 1979 and be completed by the end of 1982. The purchase of equipment
and civil works components are expected to be completed by the end of 1981.
Provision of consulting services has been made in the proposed project
to assist Regifercam in supervising the civil works contracts, including the
manufacturing and installation of the electrical signaling system in the new
Douala station and marshalling yard.
Procurement
(a) Civil Works
3.25      The civil works will be advertised internationally and the contracts
will be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines. An exception will be contracts for small buildings to be erected
in the new Douala station area and at the training center, which will only be
advertised locally. The total cost of these small buildings is estimated at
US$1.7 million equivalent.
(b) Equipment and Machine Tools
3.26      Railway equipment, other equipment and machine tools for the work-
shops and the training center will be bought through international competitive
bidding, except for the locomotive spare parts for which the critical items
will be procured from the manufacturer of the existing locomotives or from



- 28 -
the manufacturer of the original equipment. The cost with contingencies of
the spare parts is about US$0.8 million equivalent of which the Bank would
finance 50%.
(c) Consulting Services and Technical Assistance
3.27      The ongoing contract for management assistance to the office of the
Deputy General Manager for Studies (para 3.17(a)) will be extended under the
proposed loan. This will cost a total of about US$0.9 million equivalent
including contingencies.
3.28      Candidates for the staffing of the Organization and Methods Units
will be selected by the borrower on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank, in cooperation with the institution providing the existing technical
assistance teams (OFERMAT, France). If suitable technical assistants cannot
be found by this procedure, the borrower will seek candidates elsewhere with
Bank assistance. In any event, the Bank will finance this component, closely
scrutinize the experience and qualifications of the candidates and supervise
the progress of their work. The estimated total cost of this component is
US$4.2 million equivalent including contingencies.
3.29      Technical assistants for training, consultants for the execution
of the feasibility and engineering studies for the second phase of the work-
shop expansion, and consulting engineers to assist Regifercam in the supervi-
sion of the works under contracts will be selected by the borrower on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Disbursements
3.30      Disbursements from the loan and credit accounts, which will be fully
documented, will be made on the following basis:
(a) 100% of the foreign cost or 85% of the local cost of imported
material and equipment (mainly track material, machinery,
spare parts for freight cars, and furniture, equipment and
material for training);
(b) 50% of the foreign cost of spare parts for locomotives;
(c) Civil works, including signaling, telecommunication, water
supply and electrical installations with the necessary
equipment: 80% of the cost of contracts; and
(d) Consulting services and technical assistants:
85% of total expenditures.
3.31      Disbursements for the Yaounde locomotive running shed and the
rolling stock maintenance facilities will be conditional upon Regifercam
furnishing the Bank with the design and engineering plans for these facilities
and a proposal for a motive power and rolling stock maintenance policy which
are satisfactory to the Bank.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
4.01      The project has four separately identifiable elements:  a marshalling
yard at Douala; expansion of the locomotive workshop at Douala and construction
of a running shed and rolling stock maintenance facilities at Yaounde; equip-
ment, including that for track maintenance and replacement of wagon bogies; and
technical assistance and studies. Of these, the marshalling yard, the work-
shops, running shed and rolling stock maintenance facilities, and the equipment
have separately identifiable benefit streams and are analysed accordingly below.
Total project economic rates of return, including the sensitivity analysis,



- 30 -
are assessed including the cost of technical assistance and studies attribut-
able to the project. These project elements are expected to contribute to
improvements in Regifercam's operational efficiency, but it is not possible
to identify these benefits separately.
B.   Project Benefits
Marshalling Yard
4.02      Marshalling facilities at Douala are operating close to capacity
and indeed the incremental traffic between FY1979 and FY1980 is likely to place
considerable strain on them. The capacity of the main yard (Douala station)
cannot be expanded and it is subject to flooding during the frequent heavy
rains. Its inadequacy has necessitated the use of other stations in the
area for marshalling and the overall capacity limitations together with the
problem of coordination of movements between the stations is a major contri-
butory factor to the high average turnaround time of wagon (11 days). The
major benefits from the marshalling yard will be a reduction in turnaround
time of wagons and the associated improvement in utilization of both mainline
and shunting locomotives.  Wagon turnaround time should be reduced by about
three days (over 25%) with a proportionate reduction in the need for wagon
purchases and the avoidance of purchase of two mainline and two shunting
locomotives. Annex 2, Tables 8 and 9 show the marked increase in concentra-
tion of marshalling activity under the proposed project compared with that
employing the existing, dispersed facilities.
4.03      The proposed facility will handle all traffic except Celluca-m paper,
petroleum, alumina and the between one-third and one-half of all logs which
will go directly to the port. The determinant of the demand on the facility
is the number of wagons in the dominant flow, which is southbound. The total
southbound movements through the facility will increase by about a quarter,
from FY1979 to FY1983 after which there will be a decline as a result of road
competition and then a recovery towards FY1989. Thus there will be a capacity
deficit equivalent to about 17% of total southbound demand by FY1983 and 44%
by FY1989 (Annex 2, Table 10).
4.04      In the absence of investment to relieve the marshalling bottleneck
traffic will either be suppressed or diverted to road. The poor road condition
and the fact that traffic suppression has already been experienced suggest
that the former is a serious possibility. However, traffic could theoretically
move between Douala and Yaounde by a circuitous route via Baffoussam and thus
the second set of benefits from the project element is avoidance of the asso-
ciated road transport costs. These transport costs are based upon diversion
via Baffoussam or over the earth and gravel road between Edea and Yaounde
(Douala to Edea is paved) until a new paved road is built between Douala and
Yaounde. Assuming this road is completed in FY1983, road transport costs
would fall significantly thereafter with a consequent decline in the benefits
from avoidance of traffic diversion to road.
4.05      In assessing road transport costs, no account is taken of the
investment cost of road paving in view of the probability that the main



- 31 -
justification of road upgrading will be passenger and generated freight
traffic rather than the fairly small number of truck movement required to
transport traffic diverted from rail.
4.06      The economic rate of return on the marshalling yard facilities,
based upon operational improvements and the avoidance of traffic diversion
to road, is 20%. This is considered a minimum in view of the possibility
that short-run traffic suppression would occur without the project.
Locomotive Workshop Expansion and Yaounde Running Shed Construction
4.07      On the basis of the best traffic estimate freight traffic in the
dominant (southbound) direction is expected to nearly double between FY1979
and FY1983 from 233 m/t-km to 447 m/t-km. To handle this traffic, Regifercam
has ordered an additional 20 2000/2400 HP locomotives, due for delivery about
FY1980 (Canadian financed). Taking into consideration retirement of older
locomotives in the 500 HP range, withdrawal from service of the CC 2400 class
locomotives, and purchase of an additional 10 BB 900 locomotives which are
being delivered, the net additions to the fleet will be 13 between FY1979
and FY1981 excluding the standby locomotives which will not require servic-
ing. Eight more locomotives will probably be required by about FY1986. Thus
the demand upon running sheds and workshops can be expected to increase by
about 50% between FY1978 and the late 1980's. These facilities are already
operating close to capacity and without an additional running shed and an
expansion of the workshops, delays in servicing would increase and locomotive
availability could be expected to decline significantly. The running shed
requirement is particularly acute -- new locomotives should not require
workshop attention before they are two years old but running shed operations
are needed almost immediately (after about 2000 km).
4.08      Consequently, without an expansion of workshop and running shed
capacity, the forecast increase in the locomotive fleet would result in
.decreased service time per locomotive and this in turn would reduce avail-
ability.  Annex 2, Table 11 shows the effect in detail.  In summary, without
the project availability would be reduced by about one-fifth by FY1982 and
one-third by the late 1980's.
4.09      The primary effect would be to require locomotive purchases to
overcome the resultant capacity shortages. These purchases are estimated
as ten in FY1982 and a further thirteen spread over FYs1983-89.
4.10      However, without any addition to the workshop/running shed capacity,
the new locomotives would be out of action again after about two years. Thus
there would be a secondary effect equivalent to major overhaul of locomotives
by the manufacturers every two years. Shipment to Europe or elsewhere, serv-
icing, and return, would effectively immobilize these locomotives for about
one year in three. This would necessitate purchase of an additional four
locomotives and advancing of the purchase of other locomotives and entail
the cost of transportation to/from the supplier (Annex 2, Table 12).
4.11      Avoidance of these primary and secondary effects constitutes the
main quantifiable benefit from workshop and running shed investment. The



- 32 -
benefits assessed on this basis are less than the economic costs of divert-
ing the traffic hauled by these locomotives to road. The quantified benefit
streams thus constitute the minimum resulting from the project element. Addi-
tionally, there would be unquantified benefits in terms of more efficient
servicing operations and improvement in Regifercam's ability to deal with
emergency repairs. The economic rate of return on the workshop and running
shed element is over 17%.
Equipment
4.12      The project includes about CFAF 600 million of equipment, including
inspection cars and wagon bogies. The main benefits are obtained from rehab-
ilitation of wagons by replacement of bogies but the individual components are
too small to justify separate analysis. The benefits are consequently grouped
and yield an economic return of 15%.
C.   Total Project Costs and Benefits
4.13      Total project economic costs and benefits are detailed in Annex 2,
Table 13 and summarized below.
Total Costs
(CFAF million)      Rates of Return
Project Element        1979/80 - 80/81              %

Workshops/sheds             2,675                  17
Equipment                      625                 15
Total Project /a            8,242                  18
/a   Including technical assistance costs attributable
to the project.
4.14      The project yields a satisfactory rate of return of 18% including
the costs of technical assistance which benefit the project. The major
elements -- the marshalling yards and the locomotive workshop and running
shed investments -- meet an urgent need which will become acute as equipment
supplied by other aid agencies comes into service and traffic consequently
inereases. The overall first year rate of return is 36%, indicating the
project is overdue.
D.   Sensitivity Analysis
4.15      For the sensitivity analysis the following assumptions have been
made: (a) investment costs will be 10% above project estimates, which is the
maximum considered likely as detailed engineering information is already
available regarding the major element, the marshalling yard; (b) traffic
(other than aluminum/alumina and paper for which future transport require-
ments are known with reasonable certainty) will grow at only half the
forecast rate between FYs1979 and 1983; and (c) after FY1983 traffic will



- 33 -
decline as a result of road competition. In addition to the effect of the
same percentage decline as assumed under the best traffic estimate, a further
factor has been applied to take into account the possibility that road trans-
port costs will be lower, and thus the diversion co-efficient higher, than can
be assessed on the basis of existing information. The feasibility study on
the Douala-Yaounde road, now being prepared by consultants GAUFF (West Germany)
and which should be completed in the fall of 1979, should give guidance on
this point.
4.16      While the above sensitivity tests are rigorous, the uncertainties
concerning the future of two of Regifercam's most important traffic items,
timber and freight from Chad and CAE, make them appropriate.  The sensitivity
analysis rates of return are, with increased costs and decreased benefits,
on the marshalling yard 10%, on the workshops 10% and on the equipment
(unchanged) 15%. For the total project, with unchanged costs and decreased
benefits the rate is 11%, with increased costs and unchanged benefits 16%,
and with costs increased and benefits decreased 10%. These rates are con-
sidered acceptable, particularly in view of the comparatively long gestation
period for a project of the complexity of a marshalling yard, and the con-
sequent need for adequate capacity to be built into the project to allow for
the possibility of traffic growth exceeding sensitivity forecasts.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Past and Present Position
5.01      Regifercam's operating revenue increased 180% from FY1973 to FY1978
or 23% per year; 48% of this growth was generated by increased traffic volumes
and changes in the traffic structure and the remaining 52% by tariff increases.
Tariffs, on the average, increased by about 70% during this period. This,
however, was only sufficient to offset inflation, with the effect that, in
constant prices, the tariff level remained virtually unchanged.  Since tariff
increases in the six years preceding 1973 were insufficient to offset infla-
tion, Regifercam's tariffs were in early 1978, in constant prices, about 25%
below the 1967 level. Tariff increases in July 1978 reduced this gap to about
17%, but additional increases in excess of inflation are needed to improve the
railway's cash generation.
5.02      Regifercam's working and operating expenses grew by about 200% and
190% respectively from FY1973 to FY1978, somewhat exceeding the growth of
operating revenues and leading to a deterioration of the railway's working
and operating ratios particularly during the first part of the review period,
followed by a slight improvement. The principal causes for this mediocre
performance were operational problems and insufficient cost control. Due
inter alia to the technical assistance provided under the Third Railway
Project, progress in these problem areas is being made, in particular in
the important fields of locomotive maintenance and budgetary control.

1/   Target under the Third Railway Project: 72%.
5.04      Tariff increases during the last two years have exceeded inflationary
cost increases by about 14% and the Governuent accepts the general principle
of annual railway tariff increases sufficient at least to offset inflation.
Recent tariff increases have also been used to improve the rate structure
and its relationship to operating costs. Further improvements may be needed,
once Regifercam's costing system produces more detailed and reliable results
(para. 2.09). Most tariffs appear to cover at least marginal costs, with
the exception of freight tariffs on the western line and passenger tariffs.
Losses on these latter services stem from inadequate rates and fares and
operational problems such as inefficient passenger fare collection and poor
train scheduling. Regifercam recently began to remedy the situation by
closing stations on the western line and improving passenger fare collection.
Additional measures will be needed to ensure that these services cover at
least their long-term marginal costs, estimated at about 60% of total costs
of these services.  Regifercam agreed to implement by December 1980 necessary
measures to achieve this figure and to submit to the Bank by June 1981 a



- 35 -
report analyzing the avoidable costs of these services and recommending
measures to cover them through operating revenues. The Government agreed
to pay during an interim period not extending beyond December 1983 specific
offsetting subsidies to the railway, should it object to measures proposed
by the railway to achieve the above target. The Government will also submit
to the Bank by June 1981 a study to determine the most economical, long-term
distribution of traffic between rail and road in the area served by the
Western line.
5.05      Depreciation is calculated at realistic rates.  In FY1978 depre-
ciation amounted to 3.3% of the book value of gross fixed assets in service.
Assets are, however, valued at acquisition costs. At negotiations, the rail-
way agreed to depreciate, on the basis of replacement cost, its motive power
and rolling stock beginning immediately and its track material beginning in
FY1982; both will be revalued thereafter every three years.
5.06      Regifercam's debt service quadrupled from 1973 to 1978, due to an
increased investment volume and a hardening of borrowing terms, accompanied
by only a small increase in cash generation from operations, necessitating
borrowing on a larger scale.  Regifercam's cash generation from operations
actually stagnated until FY1976 and only then increased, due to substantial
tariff increases, implemented under the auspices of the preceding Bank project.
These tariff increases also prevented the debt service coverage ratio from
dropping below a critical 0.9 in FY1978.
5.07      Throughout the review period, the railway's delicate financial
position was alleviated through subsidies from the Government of Cameroon,
amounting to CFAF 1.6 billion in FY1978, partly in the form of tax exemptions
and partly as cash subsidies. In addition, the railway used bank overdrafts,
amounting to CFAF 1.4 billion as of June 1978, mostly to cover financing gaps
in its investment program.
.5.08      The need for general operational subsidies and bank overdrafts
can be eliminated only in the medium term through increased internal cash
generation. In the immediate future, overdrafts must be refinanced through
loans. One such loan of CFAF 750 million for six years has been obtained by
Regifercam under Government auspices in May 1978 from the Office National
de Commercialisation des Produits de Base (ONCPB), and higher amounts may be
neeeded during the next 12 months. The railway reduced its overdrafts to less
than CFAF 1 billion before negotiations. Regifercam agreed to limit overdrafts
to CFAF 800 million after 1979, and to use these only in exceptional circum-
stances and for short periods of time.
5.09      In spite of Regifercam's mediocre earning performance and rather
heavy capital investment during the review period, the railway's debt to
equity ratio increased only moderately from 35/65 to 44/56, because nearly 50%
of Regifercam's investments were financed through grants which strengthened
the railway's equity. Thus, the railway's indebtedness is presently at a
reasonably low level and does not constrain its potential for future borrow-
ing, assuming, however, that internal cash generation will increase sharply
in the near term.



- 36 -
B.   Future Financial Position
5.10      The most important feature of Regifercam's future financial position
is the need for a rapid and sustained increase of internal cash generation to
alleviate the present liquidity shortage and to cope with a rapidly increasing
debt service. Interest on and repayment of existing debt will increase from a
total of CFAF 1.9 billion in FY1978 to CFAF 2.7 billion in FY1980. Additional
borrowing, negotiated since July 1978 or required to refinance short-term debt
and finance necessary capital investment, including the proposed project, will
add another CFAF 0.9 billion to FY1980 debt service, bringing it to a total of
CFAF 3.6 billion for that year, CFAF 5.4 billion in FY1983 and CFAF 6.5 billion
in FY1985. The last two figures include CFAF 375 million to service an assumed
medium-term loan of CFAF 1.5 billion to refinance existing and expected over-
drafts and to finance necessary increases in working capital (cf. Annex 2,
Tables 15 and 18).
5.11      There is little scope for reducing future debt service through a
reduction of capital investment and borrowing, since most of the investment
is needed to increase Regifercam's productivity and its capacity to cope
with existing and expected traffic demand. Also, more concessional terms of
financing can probably not be obtained by Regifercam since the largest single
item--the realignment of the Douala-Edea section--will be financed as a grant
by the Government, and most of the substantial investment in freight cars
will be financed by a highly concessional credit from CIDA (Canada). Close
attention to Regifercam's future capital investment and borrowing is, never-
theless, needed. Regifercam agreed to:
(a)  seek, until completion of the project, the Bank's approval
for any capital investment costing more than $2.5 million;
and
(b)  seek the Bank's approval for any long-term borrowing
exceeding a certain aggregate amount to be agreed upon
from time to time. Appropriate ceilings have been
established for the next three years.
5.12      There is scope during the next two years for increasing Regifercam's
internal cash generation through tariff increases, since in the absence of an
asphalt road, the railway presently enjoys a virtual monopoly on Transcameroon
traffic (accounting for more than 90% of its revenue). Construction of an
asphalt road between Douala and Yaounde, accounting for about one-third of the
length of the Transcameroon line, is expected to be completed around 1983,
at which time the railway will be exposed to serious competition for a
substantial share of its freight traffic. Thus, tariff increases in excess of
inflation should be concentrated in the next three years, followed by moderate
increases thereafter. Suitable increases have been agreed for 1979, 1980
and 1981 which will raise tariffs in real terms to about 90% of the 1967 level.
These increases, combined with forecast traffic growth, would increase cash
generation from CFAF 1.6 billion in FY1978 to CFAF 3.8 billion in FY1980 and
CFAF 6.6 billion in FY1981. At the same time, the debt service coverage ratio
would improve from 0.9 in FY1978 to 1.4 in FY1981, and the working ratio from
84% to 66%.



- 37 -
5.13      After 1981, the railway will face two major constraints:  growing
road competition and difficulty in achieving rapid productivity gains once
existing overstaffing is absorbed. To assist Regifercam in improving its
productivity and coping with road competition, the proposed project includes
a large training and technical assistance component, and incorporates an
operational plan of action. To maintain Regifercam's tariffs at a competitive
level, tariff increases after 1981 should not exceed inflation. An average
annual reduction of railway tariffs in real terms of about 2% p.a. has been
assumed, reducing Regifercam's freight rate level, expressed in 1978 prices,
from CFAF 16.7/ton-km in FY1982 to CFAF 16.0 in FY1984. At this latter level,
Regifercam would have a sufficient cost advantage over trucking costs on the
Douala-Yaounde section, estimated on a comparable basis at CFAF 20/ton-km
in 1978 prices, to permit it to compete effectively. No road construction
is planned between Yaounde and Ngaoundere to replace existing earth roads.
Thus, the railway would maintain its nearly monopolistic position for traffic
originating and terminating beyond Yaounde, which accounts for an increasing
share of Regifercam's volume. Rail tariffs could, therefore, be increased
parallel with inflation after FY1984. Based, however, on Regifercam's then
satisfactory financial situation, further annual decreases of 2% in real terms
would be acceptable and have been assumed.
5.14      The forecast income accounts assume an inflation rate of 10% per
annum and, based on past experience, reasonable gains in staff productivity.
Full achievement of the goals of the railway's action plan would produce
additional savings in operating costs. Beginning in FY1981, an extra increase
in cash generation from passenger traffic by about CFAF 900 million p.a. has
also been assumed, based either on rationalization of this traffic or on an
offsetting Government subsidy (para. 5.04). Due to the lack of data, no
corresponding estimate was made for freight traffic on the western line;
the amounts involved are substantially smaller, probably between CFAF 100
and 150 million.
5.15      Assuming that the above tariff increases are implemented in a timely
fashion and that the other assumptions materialize as expected, Regifercam's
income accounts and balance sheets will develop as indicated in Tables 19 to
21 of Annex 2 and summarized below:

/1   On unrevalued assets.
5.16      The above figures indicate achievement of a satisfactory financial
performance in the fiscal years 1981 to 1983, as reflected in working ratios
of 66% to 62% and an improved debt service coverage of up to 2.1. Under the
impact of stronger road competition, Regifercam's financial situation is less
good but still satisfactory beginning in FY1984: the working ratio increases
to 70% and the debt service coverage drops to 1.7 and later recovers to 1.9.
Regifercam agreed to take all measures necessary to ensure that its wirking
ratio will not exceed 75% for FY1980, 72% for FY1981, 70% for FY1982 and
subsequent years until completion of the planned Douala-Yaounde road, and 75%
thereafter. These ratios take the results of the sensitivity analysis (para.
5.19) into consideration.
5.17      The debt service coverage does not drop below a satisfactory 1.7
after 1981 and the debt/equity ratio oscillates around an acceptable 50/50
until FY1983 and improves thereafter. The liquid position also improves to a
satisfactory level. A forecast of sources and applications of funds is shown
in Table 18 of Annex 2 and summarized below for the project period (FY1980 to
FY1983):

5.18      During the project period, 59% of capital investment is expected to
be financed through borrowing, 24% through grants and 17% through Regifercam's
internal cash generation. Regifercam's contribution is relatively small, since
most of the railway's substantial cash generation will be allocated to debt
service and to increases in working capital. Regifercam's cash generation will
however be sufficient to ensure that the railway can finance its contribution
to the cost of the proposed project and to other capital investment.
C.   Sensitivity Analysis
5.19      The major risk that Regifercam faces in coming years is a shortfall
in freight traffic below forecast levels. The economic sensitivity analysis
assumes substantially smaller traffic increases, and the same assumptions have
been made for this analysis. Lower traffic would be accompanied by reductions
.in operating costs, which, however, would not suffice to offset the loss in
revenue, resulting from reduced traffic growth and a 11% drop of freight
traffic in FY1984. Additional tariff increases in real terms after FY1982
to maintain Regifercam's financial equilibrium without resorting to government
subsidies may be difficult to implement in the face of heavy road competition.
The scope for additional tariff increases would largely depend on actual
trucking rates on a paved road between Douala and Yaounde. It is obviously
difficult to give a reasonably accurate estimate of what these rates would
be.
5.20      Assuming that tariff increases until FY1984 were limited to those
in the main analysis, i.e. a reduction of railway tariffs in constant prices
of about 2% per annum in FY1983 and FY1984, and assuming increases in parallel
with inflation thereafter, the Government would have to subsidize the rail-
way a total of about CFAF 5 billion during the first three years after com-
pletion of the planned Douala-Yaounde road. The sensitivity analysis fore-
casts (Annex 2, tables 22 to 25) show the need for a subsidy of about CFAF 2
billion in FY1984, decreasing to zero by FY1987. The resulting figures for
Regifercam's future cash flow and some critical ratios are summarized below.

5.21      The working ratio increases after 1983 to 74% and improves there-
after, and the debt service ratio drops with completion of the Douala-Yaounde
road to 0.9 and improves subsequently to an acceptable 1.3 in PY1987. There
is a risk that the Governmeat may have to subsidize the railway for several
years after completion of the planned road. The Government agreed at nego-
tiations to provide subsidies or such other financial support for Regifercam
as may be appropriate to protect the railway's liquidity should the need
arise.
5.22      A separate analysis was made in the context of the sensitivity
analysis to establish whether the proposed project would under pessimistic
assumptions contribute to the improvement of Regifercam's financial situation,
and if so, to what extent (cf. Annex 3). FY1985 was selected for this anal-
ysis, being fairly typical of the assumed conditions and not too distant in
the future. Individual flows of cash in and out of the railway were cal-
culated on the basis of the economic analysis, mainly through eliminating
benefits which accrue to beneficiaries outside the railway and through in-
flating the constant prices of the economic analysis. The results suggest
that, after paying the full debt service on the proposed loan, the railway
is CFAF 1.7 billion per year better off with the project than without it.
If the project were not implemented, the Government would have to pay an
additional annual subsidy of about $7.6 million. This figure would tend to
increase in later years, but precise calculations distorted by time become
less meaningful.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Agreement has been reached that:
(a)  the Government will:
(i)  carry out a study, to be reviewed by the Bank, to determine
the best solution for improving the rail section between
Edea and Maloume, and not undertake any capital investment
on the railway's Edea-Maloume section unless its economic
justification has been demonstrated (para 1.23);
(ii) provide during an interim period until December 1983 for
specific offsetting subsidies to Regifercam, should it
object to measures proposed by the railway to reduce
losses in freight traffic on the Western line and
passenger traffic to 40% or less of the total cost
of these services (para. 5.04);
(iii)  submit to the Bank by June 1981 a study determining
the economically best long-term distribution of
traffic between rail and road in the area served by
Regifercam's Western line (para. 5.04); and
(iv) provide subsidies or such other financial support for
Regifercam as may be appropriate to protect the rail-
way's liquidity should the need arise (para. 5.21).
(b)  Regifercam will:
(i)  submit to the Bank for review by June 30, 1980 a draft man-
power plan, with the objectives of reducing overstaff-
ing and ensuring a better matching of job requirements
and staff qualifications; implementation of this plan
will begin promptly after such review and will be com-
pleted five years thereafter; in the meantime, increases
of total staff number will be limited to imperative needs
(para. 2.03);
(ii) consult annually with the Bank on its technical assis-
tance requirements and on measures necessary to meet
them (para. 2.04);



- 42 -
(iii) produce annually, beginning with FY1981, a comprehensive
investment budget and a corresponding financing plan
covering all railway-related investment irrespective of
the source of financing; and submit, beginning FY1981,
its draft budgets to the Bank for review at least 30 days
before consideration by Regifercam's board, but in any
event not later than one month before the beginning of
the fiscal year covered by the budget. The same will
apply, mutatis mutandis, to any amendments to the original
investment budget proposed to be made during the year
(para. 2.11);
(iv)  submit to the Bank not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year an audit report by auditors
acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.13);
(v) implement the plan of action incorporated in the Loan
Agreement (para. 2.27);
(vi)  make arrangements by December 1980, for the construction
of an adequate passenger station building and related
facilities for the new Douala station (para. 3.12);
(vii) institute, on terms acceptable to the Bank, by
December 1979, Organization and Method Units in its
three operating departments and provide Cameroonian
counterparts of adequate number and qualification
for the technical assistants provided for these units
under the proposed project (para. 3.17 (b));
(viii)  implement by December 1980 necessary measures to reduce
losses in freight traffic on the Western line and in
passenger traffic to 40% or less of total cost of these
services, and submit to the Bank by June 1981 a report
on the avoidable costs of these services and their re-
covery from operating revenue (para. 5.04);
(ix)  depreciate, on the basis of replacement cost, its motive
power and rolling stock beginning immediately and its
track material beginning in FY1982; both will be revalued
thereafter every three years (para. 5.05);
(x) after 1979, limit bank overdrafts to CFAF 800 million
and use them only in exceptional circumstances and for
short periods (para. 5.08);
(xi)  seek, until completion of the project, the Bank's
approval for any capital investment costing more than
$2.5 million; and seek the Bank's approval for any long-
term borrowing exceeding a certain aggregate amount to
be agreed upon from time to time (para. 5.11); and



- 43 -
(xiii)  take necessary measures, including but not limited to
agreed rate increases (para. 5.12), to achieve working
ratios of not more than 75% for FY1980, 72% for FY1981,
70% for FY1982 and subsequent years until completion
of the planned Douala-Yaounde road, and 75% thereafter
(para. 5.16).
6.02      A condition for disbursement of funds for the Yaounde locomotive
running shed and the rolling stock maintenance facilities will be that
Regifercam furnish the Bank with the design and engineering plans for these
facilites and a proposal for a motive power and rolling stock maintenance
policy which are satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.30).
6.03      Agreement having been reached on the items in para. 6.01, the
proposed project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$20 million on standard
terms to the Government of Cameroon and a Bank loan of US$27 million (includ-
ing refinancing of Loan S4-CM for US$2.0 million) to Regifercam with the
Government of Cameroon as Guarantor for a period of 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years. Onlending of the Credit to Regifercam on the
terms of the Bank loan would be a condition of effectiveness.

CAMEROON
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Description of the New Douala Station
1.   Existing Facilities
1.1       The existing railway facilities in the Douala area include six
stations:
The Port station is open for freight traffic only and is con-
nected to the Douala main station by a single track which is
used as a service siding for marshalling operations in the
latter station;
The main Doula station is the main terminal for Douala for
both passenger and freight traffic and has only five main
tracks with a very short useful length (240 to 395 m);
The New Bell station is located in the middle of the most
densely populated area of Douala, handles almost exclusively
passenger traffic and is the junction of the Douala-Yaounde
line with the western line Douala-Nkongsamba;
The Bassa station, on the Douala-Yaounde line, is devoted
mainly to freight traffic, serves the industrial zone of
northern Douala and a large log handling facility (about
10 hectares), and is expected to handle an increasingly
large volume of freight traffic in the future;
-    The Bassa-Ateliers station is located near the New Bell
station on the Western line; despite the limited capacity
of its set of tracks, it handles a relatively large amount
of traffic, both passengers and freight (the latter mostly
petroleum products from private sidings and timber unloaded
in a small log handling area) and gives access to the rail-
way workshops at Bassa; and
The Bonaberi station, located on the right bank of the Wouri
River, on the Western line, serves a growing traffic to and
from the industrial zone and the port of Bonaberi (cement,
asphalt, fertilizer, logs and fruit for export).
These stations are located on or connected to a closed loop about 10.5 km in
length which encrcles the center of Douala (see Map IBRD 14059). Recently,
the railway opened a temporary facility, on the site of the proposed new
Douala station, with a set of tracks designed to hold freight cars waiting
for space to unload in the other facilities or sidings.

1.2       The heavy traffic on the railway lines in the Douala area is ham-
pered by numerous level crossings, some located on very busy roads, and by
the limited capacity of the main Douala station. Traffic handling and car
management in the Douala area are difficult, particularly on the loop where
it concides with the main line. There is much delay in transferring loco-
motives, passenger coaches and railcars to and from the maintenance facilities
and freight cars from one facility to another.
1.3       The main Doula station is subject to frequent flooding during the
rainy season, stopping traffic and damaging locomotives and rolling stock.
2.   Proposed New Doula Station (Bessengue)
2.1       The proposed new Douala station for both passengers and freight will
be located on the northeast part of the closed loop, between the Bassa-Ateliers
station and tne eastern rail access to the Douala Port.
2.2       The new facilities co;nprise:
(a) a marshalling yard with sets of tracks for freight traffic
and a rail bridge (access to the workshops and maintenance
facilities);
(b) a platform and surfaced areas for cargo-handling, including
required service sidings;
(c) a warehouse and its service tracks;
(d) a wagon maintenance shed;
(e) various small service buildings and fixed installations;
(f) internal service roads and parking areas;
(g) a passenger station with tracks, platforms, a passenger
station building, access roads and parking areas;
(h) a set of tracks for servicing and parking passenger coaches;
(i) a public road to the freight station and yard; and
(j)  a road bridge to replace the level crossing on the busy
Douala-Yaounde road (overhead crossing of 10 tracks of the
new marshallirig yard sldings).
2.3        The riew ouala sta ton        rtll be the irly terminal ti the Douala area
for passenger traffeic, both for the Transcameroon line and the Western line.
2.4        The new marshalling yard will handle all freight traffic to and
from the Douala area except about two-thirds of the-log export traffic, which
will pass directly to the port where adequate facilities are provided for in
the Second Douala Port Project, and the imported commodities destined for the
Edea aluminium plant.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
2.5       The capacity of the new marshalling yard will be as follows:
-    in terms of the maximum number of freight cars which can
be parked in the station: 440 vehicles or more than twice
the peak daily traffic entering the facility (1985);
-    in terms of number of freight trains entering the facility
daily: 9; and
-    in terms of gross load entering the facility daily:  9000 tons.
This capacity is adequate to meet estimated traffic demands in peak periods
through 1985 and can be easily increased by 25% at low marginal cost.
3.   Merits of the Proposed Solution
3.1       The main benefit arising from the construction of the new Douala
station stems from the alleviation of the capacity constraint resulting from
both the exiguity of the existing main station, which cannot be expanded, and
the difficulty in coordinating movements between the stations and sidings and
between the terminals and the workshops.
3.2       The main operational benefit of this element of the project is
improved efficiency resulting from: (i) concentration of marshalling capacity
in one central area (the new yard and the port will eventually be connected by
a double track line of 2.5 km); (ii) the reduction of train movements by more
than 50%; (iii) the direct access from the main line to the marshalling yard
and passenger station; and (iv) a direct connection with the railway workshops
and the petroleum sidings.
3.3       The concentration of all passenger traffic in the new terminal of
Bessengue will provide benefits arising from better coordination of passenger
train movements and from improved maintenance and service of passenger rolling
stock. However, this implies the closing down of the other existing passenger
terminals, with a resulting increase in the distance between the homes of
passengers and the Bessengue station (average increase 1.3 km or about 55%).
3.4       A further benefit of the proposed project is the elimination of
traffic stoppages and damage to rolling equipment caused by the frequent
flooding of the existing main station.
3.5       All the benefits mentioned above have been assessed in detail in
the consultants' Feasibility Study (June 1977). The following theoretical
global results from the comparison of the two solutions envisaged in this
study, the proposed solution and the reference case with rehabilitation and
limited improvement of the existing facilities, are worthy of note:

Freight car daily mileage                        4,745              3,947
Passenger coach-hours spent per
day in the Douala area                            60.3               14.2
Passenger coach daily mileage                      603                283
Unpredictable delays in locomotive and rolling stock movements stemming from
the dispersed facilities of the reference case have not been taken into con-
sideration in the consultants' assessments. For the rolling stock, it can
be assumed from experience that three vehicle-days per rotation would be
gained by the concentration of the marshalling operations in one central area.
4.   Conclusions
4.1       On operational grounds, there is no doubt that the proposed project
will provide substantial benefits in terms of both capacity and productivity
enabling Regifercam to have better control over its operations in the Douala
area.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Financial Benefits FY1985 Derived from Economic Sensitivity Analysis
A.   Cash flow from additional traffic (marshalling yard):
(i)  average distance freight traffic:  415 km;
(ii)  additional rail traffic due to project:
20,000 tons = 8.5 million t-km;
(iii)  revenue per t-km:
CFAF 16.7/t-km x 1.7 = CFAF 28.4/t-km
(1.7 = index rate increases);
(iv) working ratio FY1985: 75%;
(v)                             Marginal Cost as %
of Working Expenses        Weight
staff                         66                   46
fuel                         100                    9
other material                80                   20
other                          U                   25
55                 100
(vi) marginal cost in % of freight revenue:
55% x .75 = 41%
(vii)  cash flow per t-km:
CFAF 28.4 x (1.0-0.4) = CFAF 16.8
(viii)  cash flow from additional traffic:
CFAF 16.8 x 8.5 million t-km = CFAF 140 million
B.   Savings in investment for wagons (marshalling yard):
CFAF 537 million x 1.5 (escalation 1978-85) = CFAF 805 million

ANNEX 3
Page 2
C.   Staff cost savings (marshalling yard):
CFAF 85 million x 1.7 (inflation at 8% from 1978 to 1985)
= CFAF 144 million
D.   Savings in locomotive purchases (workshops):
average per year: CFAF 520 million x 1.5 = CFAF 780 million
E.   Savings in shipping locomotives to/from Europe (workshops):
average per year: CFAF 75 million x 1.5 = CFAF 113 million
F.   Savings from investment in equipment:
CFAF 100 million x 1.5 = CFAF 150 million
G.   Savings in working expenses. due to technical assistance and
training:
These savings are estimated at 10%; we remain prudent and
assume only one half of this:
5% of CFAF 19,142 million = CFAF 957 million
H.   Debt service Bank loan:
CFAF 1,479 million, minus debt service engineering loan:
CFAF 68 million = CFAF 1.411 million
I.   Net cash generation FY85 from project:
Items A to G, minus item H:
CFAF 1,678 million
