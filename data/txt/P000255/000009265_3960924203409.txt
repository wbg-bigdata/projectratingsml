PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) relates to IDA credit
759-BUR, Artisan, Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project approved on
December 22, 1977. During implementation the project design had to undergo
substantive modifications resulting in a reallocation as well as a
cancellation of funds.
The PCR was prepared by the West Africa Projects Department. It
is based on information collected during a mission to Burkina Faso and
discussions with officials from all institutions involved as well as Staff
Appraisal Report No. 1667b-UV, supervision reports and other documents
relevant to the project.
The PCR was forwarded to the Borrower in draft form for their
comments, but none were received.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
ARTISAN, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
(Credit 759-BUR)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project as origirally conceived had three objectives: (a) to
extend credit to small- and medium-scale enterprises on suitable terms
through Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) and to rural artisans
through Centre National de Perfectionnement des Artisans Ruraux (CNPAR);
(b) to finance technical assistance including traliing to the above two
institutions as well as to the Office de Promotion de l'Entreprise
Volta!que (OPEV) to strengthen their activities in promotion and support to
local enterprises; and (c) to finance technical assistance to the
Government to improve its industrial policies and its monitoring of
disbursements related to IDA credits (para 3.02). BND, OPEV and CNPAR were
the institutions responsible for carrying out Government programs fostering
small- and medium-scale enterprises, and were therefore selected as the
most suitable institutions to channel IDA funds.
During project implementation, political turmoil in the country,
combined with ineffective management of the three institutions involved,
and BND's inability to identify bankable subprojects for the line of
credit, led to significant changes in the project design. Following a
request from the Ministry of Finance, the Development Credit Agreement was
amended and the line of credit to BND was cancelled. The IDA credit thus
became a purely technical assistance project with the exception of
credit-in-kind to rural artisans extended by CNPAR--about 20% of the IDA
credit (paras 3.05 - 3.09).
The project's achievements fell far short of expectations even in
their scaled-down form. Constant interference by politicians during the
early stages of the project and the absence of a solid institutional
framework made any institutional accountability impossible, and had far
reaching consequences on the way the three institutions operated, and on
the effectiveness of their management (paras 3.10 - 3.18).
Just before the IDA project became effective, a very able and
cooperative Director General of BND was replaced by new management which
lacked commitment to BND in general and to the project in particular. BND
received the bulk of the technical assistance ($999,327), and during early
project implementation, achieved some degree of financial stability through
credit restraint, a close watch on liquidity and improved loan recovery.
However, the remaining technical assistance was not as beneficial. BND was
not very cooperative with the Bank, and without prior IDA approval, signed
contracts with consulting firms based on fees that exceeded the amount
originally earmarked for those tasks. Subsequently, IDA reluctantly
approved these contracts. In a number of cases, the consultants never
completed their tasks, blaming lack of adequate time in relation to the
scope of work required. One consulting firm left behind 14 procedural
manuals without adequately training BND staff to use them (paras 3.10 -
3.12, 4.01 - 4.03).



v 
The BND-OPEV relationship was strained from the beginning.  The
two institutions were unable to agree on standards for credit applications
and appraisal reports and did not keep each other informed of their
activities. It became clear early on that the line of credit would not be
committed or disbursed on the basis of projects prepared by OPEV. Although
I subproject was approved in 1979, it was subsequently withdrawn when the
decision was made to cancel the line of credit. Our brief experience with
the private sector in Burkina Faso has demonstrated that establishment of
viable industries in that country is not easy. Entrepreneurs have to face
formidable difficulties which include dependence on imports (which are
costly and arrive late), serious technical problems, a very small domestic
market, and strong competition from imported finished goods. Furthermore
the relevant institutions were not adequately staffed to build up expertise
in promoting small, suitably sized manufacturing and service industries
(para. 4,02).
BND, now operating purely as a commercial bank, has discussed
with Banques Populaires (BP) of France a "twinning" arrangement whereby BND
would receive technical services and training from BP. The BP/BND
relationship appears for the moment quite promising (para. 4.04).
OPEV and CNPAR also suffered from ineffective management and lack
of Government financial and other support. OPEV was inefficient in project
promotion and was finally closed down on May 1, 1986. Although CNPAR
appears to be the only institution that by and large lived up to IDA
expectations, it too has faced problems, including inadequate supervision
capability and serious difficulties in loan recovery (paras 3.13 - 3.15,
3.17, 3.18).
All the funds put at the disposal of the Government for the
industrial policy study, the financial sector study and technical
assistance to the External Debt Department of the Treasury, resulted in
marginal benefits. The industrial policy review was unfortunately
published in July 1981, eight months after a military coup, at a time when
senior Government officials were preoccupied by other matters. The study
received little attention. The financial sector study, which was expected
to make a significant contribution to the definition of the future role of
BND and CNDI, was of little value to the Government. Its recommendations
were never implemented. The technical assistance to the Treasury started
well but progressively deteriorated. It also resulted in marginal benefits
to the Treasury (paras 4.08 - 4.12).
The following lessons can be drawn from our experience with this
project:
(a) Projects involving institutions which do not have strong
Government commitment and support, and whose management is
significantly affected by state interference and political
changes, stand little chance of successful implementation.
A strong institutional framework with clearly defined
accountability usually discourages the type of political



- vi -
interference that affected so severely the institutions in
Burkina, where such a system did not exist.
(b) Projects which provide assistance toward institution
building, including the strengthening of the management of
project entities, require more intensive supervision
involving relevant skills mix.
(c)  Technical assistance to an institution stands a better
chance of success when it finances qualified individuals in
line positions for relatively long periods of time, as
evidenced by one such case in this project. Thi remaining
technical assistance, financing ad hoc short-term advisory
or expert services, resulted only in marginal benefits.
(d) It is essential that institutions receiving technical
assistance have a capability to manage and use technical
assistance effectively, including that to internalize it.
This was not the case with the institutions involved in the
project, as demonstrated repeatedly during project
implementation.
(e) Greater care should be exercised by Bank staff in the
screening and selection of consultants. In cases where the
Bank has strong reservations about the borrower's selection
of consultants on grounds of appropriate qualifications or
fees, the Bank ought to withhold its approval and where
Bank's advice is repeatedly disregarded it should seriously
consider suspension of disbursements on the relevant
component and cancellation of the remaining balance (para.
5.07).
Further assistance to BND is not being considered at this time.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
ARTISAN, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
(Credit 759-BUR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The need for a small- and medium-scale enterprises project in
Burkina Faso was identified as early as 1975 during an IDA reconnaissance
mission's discussions with the Government. Two subsequent missions, the
appraisal of the Third Highway Project and the preparation of an urban
project reiterated this need and resulted in an IDF/Urban joint identifica-
tion mission in February 1976. This SME project was appraised in Febru-
ary 1977 and an IDA credit of $4.0 was approved on December 22, 1977.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A.   Background
2.01      Similar to other Sahelian countries, Burkina Faso's natural
environment does not provide it with rich physical resources. Its most
important productive asset is its people. Demography, however, has had a
complex effect on the country. Because of tradition and the prevalence of
river-blindness in the more fertile areas of the south and southwest,
population has been concentrated disproportionately on the central plateau,
creating such adverse effects as rapid deforestation and deteriorating soil
fertility. The population has recently been moving to the less populated
areas, including areas freed of river-blindness. The most striking move-
ment, however and the most significant economically has been the emigration
of young workers to the coastal countries, primarily the C8te d'Ivoire.
Emigration has provided a safety valve for population pressure for many
years. The resulting annual inflow of remittances represents about 8
percent of GDP and an important addition to the income of the rural house-
holds receiving most of these savings.
2.02      Over the past two decades, the economy has grown by about 3
percent a year, and the Government has managed the economy reasonably well,
including the large inflow of foreign capital. Nevertheless, a three
percent rate of growth probably cannot be maintained, given the country's
deteriorating physical resource base and its ever growing population. In
the last few years, economic performance has been unsatisfactory. Twenty-
five years after independence, literacy and life expectancy remain almost
the lowest in the world, although since 1983 the Government has made major
efforts on the social front. The Government has not exercised adequate
coordination and supervision in critical areas of the economy, such as
public financial management and planning of public investment. If its
goals for economic development are to be achieved, the Government will have
to strengthen the planning, analysis and execution of its development
policies.



-2-
B.   The Industrial Sector
2.03      The small industrial sector of Burkina Faso can be characterized
by two main types of industrial activities: (a) traditional artisans who
are usually illiterate, use simple technologies, are widely dispersed, and
cater to local markets, and (b) modern enterprises which have formal
accounting systems, permanent facilities, use stable marketing channels,
and have professionally trained management. The most important activity
for both traditional and modern enterprises is food processing, followed by
construction.
2.04      The industrial sector has been facing serious bottlenecks that
cannot be easily overcome. There is a lack of technical and managerial
human resources and serious deficiencies in basic infrastructure. With a
lack of basic education, local entrepreneurs need technical assistance in
every step of project implementation. For small-scale entrepreneurs and
artisans, these problems are compounded by limited access to credit, and,
in the case of artisans, by isolation and access to market outlets.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Institutions
3.01      Three institutions, whose responsibilities included promotion of
SME activities, were originally going to benefit from the IDA project.
These were: (a) Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND), a majority
Government owned, multipurpose bank, which financed industry, agriculture,
housing, consumer durables, and managed a credit guarantee scheme for
small-scale borrowers; (b) Office de Promotion de l'Entreprise VoltaIque
(OPEV), an independent agency under the Ministry of Commerce, Industrial
Development and Mining set up to promote local enterprises; and (c) Centre
National de Perfectionnement des Artisans Ruraux (CNPAR), an independent
agency under the Ministry of Public Service and Labor, which provided basic
skill training, follow-up advice and credit-in-kind to rural artisans.
BND, OPEV and CNPAR were the institutions that had been carrying out
Government programs promoting SMEs. They were therefore selected as the
most suitable entities to channel and benefit from the IDA project.
B.   Objectives
3.02      The main goal of the IDA project was (a) to relieve entrepreneurs
from serious financial and technical bottlenecks by providing a line of
credit to SMEs through BND and to rural artisans through CNPAR, (b) to
provide technical assistance to BND, OPEV, and CNPAR to improve their
operations and strengthen their capabilities, and (c) to provide technical
assistance to the Government to study its industrial policies and to
improve the monitoring system of IDA credits. More specifically the IDA
project consisted of the following components:

1.   A line of credit to BND to provide financing for new SMEs
and expansion of existing ones in manufacturing, construc-
tion and agro-industry ($2.45 million);
2.   Technical assistance to train BND staff and to improve its
financial information systems ($250,000);
3.   Assistance to Office de Promotion de l'Entreprise Voltarque
(OPEV) to expand its management training program and to
strengthen its project promotion and follow-up capabilities
($420,000);
4.   Assistance to CNPAR to expand its artisanal training to
include urban areas and to strengthen its ability to super-
vise urban and rural artisans ($820,000);
5.   Establishment of a $400,000 revolving fund for credit-in-
kind for rural and urban artisans and cooperatives; and
6.   Assistance to the Ministry of Commerce, Industrial Develop-
ment and Mines to finance a study of Government industrial
policies, and to the Treasury to improve operations of its
External Debt Department ($60,000).
3.03      The terms of BND subloans were flexible, with a maximum of
fifteen years and a minimum of two, and were expected to average eight
years including 2 years of grace period. For small projects that fell
within the Central Bank's SSE definition, assurances were obtained that BND
would be compensated by a Government interest subsidy. It was expected
that the line of credit would finance 30 subloans largely in productive
sectors.
3.04      The original project had two other ambitious and important goals
in employment generation. It expected to: (a) generate employment in the
modern sector at an average cost of $5,000 per job, and (b) create 1,500
jobs in the informal sector at approximately $200 per job.
C.   Project Implementation
3.05      During project implementation the project had to undergo signifi-
cant modifications which changed completely the focus of the project.
These modifications, which basically converted the SME project into purely
technical assistance, were requested by the Government to respond to
(a) the need to strengthen BND's capabilities in its operations, its
accounting as well as project preparation and appraisal, and (b) the lack
of investment projects eligible for financing under the IDA line of credit.
However, despite these changes, the project achieved disappointing results,
mainly due to: (a) the political turmoil in Burkina Faso during project
implementation period and lack of commitment to the project by the
Government of Burkina, and (b) weak and ineffective management and



- 4 -
inadequately trained staff within BND and OPEV. The possibility of
cancelling the entire project was not considered either by the Government
or by IDA.
3.06      Political Turmoil.  Political instability had an extremely
negative effect on project implementation. Interference by politicians was
pervasive as early as October 1980, one month before the end of the Third
Republic. The general economic situation, which had been deteriorating
since 1979, was aggravated by purges which followed the second coup
(November 1982) and political inquiries, demotions and sanctions which
followed the third coup (August 1983). Many Government institutions became
disorganized, and morale and staff motivation deteriorated further as a
result of political promotions and reduction in indemnities and salaries, a
trend that continued through 1986. Government policies have not been
conducive to investment by the private sector.
3.07      Managerial Weaknesses.  Management in both OPEV and BND during
project implementation was unsatisfactory. The first Director General of
OPEV after the credit became effective resigned on January 1981 and left
the country in 1983 after serious allegations were made against him and his
handling of OPEV's affairs. These included allegations of mismanagement of
the Dutch Participation Fund. On account of these, the German and Dutch
aid agencies withdrew their financial and technical assistance. The French
withdrew a year later. All this effectively ended OPEV's promotional role
and hope of identifying and providing BND with tankable projects.
3.08      BND's management at that time manifested a lack of interest and
concern for the objectives of the project, and, following numerous
unsuccessful attempts by IDA missions to get management to take decisions
on substantive matters, the IDA credit component to BND, which was the core
of the original project, was cancelled at the request of the Government.
The funds freed by this cancellation were reallocated to technical
assistance to BND, OPEV and CNPAR as well as to the Government for studies.
D.   Utilization of the Credit
3.09      There were four reallocations of the IDA credit funds (Annex 1).
The first reallocation was made in November 1979. Without consulting IDA,
BND signed a contract with a consulting firm, exceeding the amount origi-
nally earmarked for technical assistance to that institution. At first,
IDA refused to finance the total costs. However, in the absence of alter-
native sources and following extensive discussions, IDA agreed to finance
the difference by transferring the required amount from the line of credit.
It had become evident that BND did not have a pipeline of viable investment
projects to be financed under the IDA line of credit. It was also felt
that a reallocation was justified on the basis of BND's serious financial
difficulties and some earlier positive results of technical assistance. A
lack of viable subprojects was the reason for the second reallocation, in
April 1982, when the entire line of credit to BND was cancelled and the
funds reallocated among other categories of the project. In January 1984,
UNIDO agreed to finance an expatriate to OPEV and thus $200,000 were made



- 5 -
available to the Government to finance a study of the financial sector
which was expected to lead to an improvement of public debt management.
The final reallocation was made in December 1985 to permit the Department
of External Debt of the Treasury to purchase a small computer.
E.   Institutional Performance
Banque Nationale Je D6veloppement (BND)
3.10      BND continued to be ineffective throughout the duration of the
project. Despite an increase in capital in 1982 by the Government, BND
moved progressively toward less risky operations in trade and real estate.
Arrears remained high and in May 1985 BND was instructed by the Government
to change its operations into purely commercial banking and to discontinue
all term lending.
3.11      BND's financial difficulties were aggravated by lack of leader-
ship. Sustained improvement in its operations was therefore impossible not
only because of weak management particularly vis-g-vis personnel policies
but also because of inexperienced and inadequately trained staff and weak
internal organization and procedures. During IDA project implementation
BND had four Directors General. Of the first three, only the second had
relevant experience but served for a little more than a year. The third
managed BND between March 83 to June 1985 when he was removed crom office
on grounds of ineffectiveness and lack of executive experience. Not until
9 months before the project's closing date did BND acquire a well motivated
and effective Director General.
3.12      In addition to all the other difficulties, BND was unable to keep
reliable accounts of its operations, making it virtually impossible to
assess its financial position during project implementation, and most
importantly was unable to use effectively the IDA technical assistance to
help it improve its financial information system.
Office de Promotion de l'Entreprise Voltalque (OPEV)
3.13       During project implementation OPEV management changed three
times. By January 1981, when OPEV's first Director General resigned, OPEV
was already in a tailspin for various reasons including managerial problems
which were mentioned in paragraph 3.07.
3.14      Project promotion in the industrial zone of Kossodo was
ineffective, and project promotion outside the zone was nonexistent.
Extension services were also ineffective due to lack of experience. Only
OPEV training activities, financed largely by the IDA credit, seem to have
been beneficial. The German, Dutch and French withdrew their financial and
technical assistance, and their withdrawal was soon followed by the depar-
ture of the UNIDO team leader in 1981. He was not replaced. The expatri-
ate staff who numbered 17 at the end of 1976 had been reduced to 7 by 1981.



-6-
3.15      In contrast with other parastatals, OPEV was never adequately
funded by the Government. For example, the Corseil burkinabe des chargeurs
(CBC) and the Office for Export Promotion (ONAC) had independent resources
in the form of an import surtax. ONAC receives more ia any one year than
OPEV has during the entire fifteen years of its existence. Attempts by
OPEV to obtain a share of this import surtax were futile. The meager
Government allocation which was limited to paying salaries only, meant that
most activities of the institution were paralyzed. The last Director
General, who took over in 1983, did concentrate on trying to find new
resources, but OPEV had already lost its credibility. It closed on May 1,
1986.
Centre National de Peifectionnement des Artisans Ruraux (CNPAR)
3.16      CNPAR was founded in 1970 with the assistance of ILO, which also
provided CNPAR with technical assistance until 1977 when the IDA credit was
approved. The strengths and weaknesses of CNPAR were largely due to the
personality of the new project director, who was a former ILO employee. He
was a doer, and disliked bureaucracy. He saw his main job as training
rural artisans and providing them with materials and tools on credit. As a
result, such activities as accounting, record-keeping, and reporting to IDA
were given relatively low priority. CNPAR produced only one sketchy
progress report, in May 1980, which mentioned that it was too early to
evaluate the project since loan recovery would not begin before 1981.
Thus, there is no detailed record of CNPAR's activities and almost no
information base on which to evaluate the effectiveness of its training and
assistance. The CNPAR component was disbursed on time for the categories
and for the purpose originally designated. Only assistance to urban
artisans was dropped following delays in implementation of the Bank urban
project.
3.17      Weaknesses in CNPAR's performance surfaced late and centered on
difficulties in the recovery of loans. It appears that a large part of
IDA's $400,000 which was intended to become a permanent revolving fund,
will not be revolving. About CFAF 120 million out of the CFAF 160 million
worth of raw materials and tools that were given to rural artisans on
credit terms is still in arrears. Another CFAF 40 million worth of goods
is still in storage in CNPAR's own storerooms. (Since funds from the Dutch
and IDA were not accounted for separately, CNPAR's Director General could
provide only orders of magnitude on the final use of IDA credit funds.)
The present Director General intends to recruit four new accountants
(hitherto, CNPAR got by with only one) and to step up recovery procedures.
He hopes to eventually recover 60 percent of the arrears which may be an
optimistic and unrealistic goal.
3.18      The Director General blamed poor loan recovery on the severe
droughts of the 1973-83 period. He also felt, that credit may have been
granted too liberally, and without the appropriate controls. For example,
credit, raw material and equipment were given automatically to all former
CNPAR trainees. Some of the trainees apparently resold the raw material
and equipment in the local market at a profit or to raise money for



- 7 -
travelling to Abidjan or other foreign cities to find work. According to
the Director General, however, most of the trainees did use CNPAR's
assistance effectively and for the purpose intended. The Director's
efforts to intensify loan recovery will probably provide a clearer picture
of CNPAR's past efficiency.
IV. IMPACT OF IDA-FUNDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
A.   BND
4.01      BND was the largest beneficiary of IDA technical assistance and
training ($999,327 disbursed out of a total of $1,767,000 disbursed for the
four entities including the Government). However, our overall experience
with BND again confirms that in order to-transfer knowledge tc the staff of
an institution and to help build up banking experience on a more permanent
basis, requires significantly lor.g periods of time.
4.02      The BND-OPEV relationship was strained from the beginning and the
lack of cooperation between the two institutions made it clear to IDA that
the line of credit would not be committed or disbursed on the basis of
projects prepared by OPEV. Although 1 subproject was approved in 1979, it
was subsequently cancelled when the decision was made to cancel the line of
credit. Our brief experience with the private sector in Burkina Faso has
demonstrated that establishment of viable industries is not easy.
Entrepreneurs have to face formidable difficulties which include dependence
on imports (which are costly and arrive late), serious technical problems,
a domestic market which is very small and strong competition from imported
finished goods. Furthermore the relevant institutions were not adequately
staffed to build up expertise in promoting small, suitably sized
manufacturing and service industries.
4.03      In order to assist BND in improving different aspects of its
operations, the IDA credit financed the technical services of several
consulting firms. The consultants' performance must be judged in the
context of an extremely difficult environment. Although there were some
successes earlier in project implementation, our overall experience with
consulting firms has not been positive. Most of the services provided by
these firms did not lead to significant long-term benefits to the institu-
tion, one complaint bei,ig that the time designated for each task was not
adequate.
4.04      BND has recently discussed a "twinning" arrangement with Banques
Populaires (BP). Under this arrangement BP would provide BND a broad range
of technical services and would establish exchange programs for training
BND Staff.
B.   OPEV
4.05      IDA funds were originally earmarked to finance the salary of an
expatriate technical adviser. However, since UNIDO subsequently accepted



- 8 -
to finance this adviser, IDA funds were used mainly for local staff. Small
amounts went to equipment and to an artisan fair sponsored by OPEV. Since
the local staff in charge of IDA-financed training were mainly in OPEV
braiches, we have little information of their performance, However,
training was generally considered by outside observers as the only benefi-
cial activity of OPEV, and IDA supervision missions sxpressed no dissatis-
faction with its progress.
C.   CNPAR
4.06      Since ILO had already established CNPAR's general institutional
character and orientation, IDA's influence was marginal. Nevertheless,
with the help of CNPAR's well motivated staff and a dynamic expatriate
director, IDA funds provided CNPAR with the means to pursue useful training
considered as a top priority. Without IDA funds CNPAR would have had to
reduce the scope of its activity. Instead, through the 1982 reallocation
of IDA funds, CNPAR was able to open 2 more branches in Dedougou and Fada
N'Gourma.
4.07      IDA also provided CNPAR staff with advice on improving (a)
accounting and auditing of the Service d'Assistance, Conseil et Soutien
(SACS) which delivers technical and marketing assistance and credit-in-kind
to artisans trained by CNPAR; and (b) the Atelier Regional de Construction
de Materiel Agricole (ARCOMA) which produces three basic types of agricul-
tural implements: small carts, ox-drawn ploughs and harnesses. Although
there were several instances of misappropriation of CNPAR's funds, advice
by IDA greatly helped in minimizing them.
D.   Technical Assistance to the Government
4.08      IDA funds financed the following technical assistance to the
Government:
4.09      (1)  Industrial Policy Study.  The IDA credit earmarked $35,000
to the Ministry of Commerce, Industrial Development and Mines to finance a
study to review (a) existing investment incentives and their impact, (b)
market prospects of SMEs and recommend appropriate incentives; and
(c) appraisal procedures in the concerned ministries and agencies including
recommendation of appropriate techniques, such as economic analysis, etc.
4.10      (2)  Financial Sector Study.  In April 1982, when BND's line of
credit was cancelled and funds were reallocated, IDA designated $120,000
for a study of Burkina Faso's financial sector. The objectives of the
study were to (a) determine the kinds of interventions which could promote
growth in the industrial sector, and (b) recommend an appropriate role for
BND and Caisse Nationale des Dgp8ts et Investissements (CNDI). BND's
traditional foreign sponsors (CCCE, KfW) insisted on completion of this
study and an official plan of action before resuming assistance to the
organization.



- 9 -
4.11      (3)  Technical Assistance to the External Debt Department in the
Treasury. According to project objectives, the IDA project included funds
for (a) improvement of operations of the External Debt Department which
supervises, inter alia, IDA projects, and (b) assistance to the Treasury in
the management of its debt.
4.12      Similar to technical assistance to BND, IDA technical assistance
to the Government achieved very little. The industrial policy study was
published by the Ministry of Commerce, Industrial Development and Mines a
few months aiter a military coup, when Government officials were preoccu-
pied by other matters. The study therefore received little or no atten-
tion. As far as the financial sector review is concerned, it did not
address relevant issues and its recommendations were not accepted. The
report received no follow-up in Burkina Faso. Finally, the technical
assistance to the Treasury provided no more information than was available
by Burkina's official debt reporting system and its benefits therefore were
marginal.
V. CONCLUSIONS & LESSONS LEARNED
5.01      As originally conceived, the bulk of the IDA credit was to be
used for term lending to SMEs and artisans through BND and CNPAR, with
smaller amounts allocated for technical assistance to BND, CNPAR, OPEV, and
to the Government. Following the cancellation of the line of credit to
BND, the IDA credit became solely a technical assistance project. BND's
institutional difficulties and IDA's preoccupations therewith led to BND's
receiving significant amounts of technical assistance.
5.02      The results of the project have overall been very disappointing.
BND was unable to use effectively the IDA technical assistance and was
ineffective throughout the duration of the project. In May 1985, it was
finally converted into a purely commercial bank. BND has entered into an
institutional cooperation agreement with the Groupe des Banques Populaires,
a relationship that appears promising. Nevertheless, BND's prospects as an
effective banking institution remain uncertain. OPEV was closed in
May 1986, and CNPAR is facing serious difficulties in the recovery of its
loans. The Government used effectively the first $25,000, but subsequently
to little effect the $261,000 it paid to three consulting firms for the
industrial policies and financial sector studies and for the assistance to
the External Debt Department of the Treasury.
5.03      The main reasons for the project's disappointing results are
(a) political turmoil and the interference of politicians into the
management of these institutions, which started early in the life of the
project, and (b) managerial weaknesses in the institutions involved. Both
had far-reaching consequences for all these institutions, including a
severe loss of staff morale in BND. Managerial weaknesses in OPEV
seriously undermined it and the cancellation of the project's credit
component was largely prompted by the lack of commitment of BND management
to the project's objectives. In 1985 a former BOAD Director and CNDI



- 10 -
Director General was appointed as the new Director General of BND. He
appears to be aware of BND's overall situation including its serious
training needs and has formulated for BND a medium-term training program
which is expected to go some way in upgrading that institution.
5.04      The above mentioned factors, political or institutional, were
largely outside the control of the Bank. When the project became a techni-
cal assistance project, Bank staff endeavored to make such assistance
effective and relevant. However, the Burkina institutions receiving this
technical assistance lacked the necessary motivation and interest. Fur-
thermore, the magnitude of technical assistance tasks and the time required
to implement them were underestimated. It is possible that the amount of
time allotted to each task was inadequate compared to the scope of the
assistance required, and the difficult environment in which the consulting
firms had to operate. It is also likely that the long-term nature of
institution-building was insufficiently taken into account in designing the
technical assistance. In any event, while there were some successes,
overall, the technical assistance resulted in very little.
5.05      It is clear from the above that greater care should have been
exercised in the screening and selection of consultants. In areas affect-
ing the overall economy, only consulting firms with the requisite prestige
and expertise could have had the authority to influence Government's
policies. In retrospect, the Bank, in the face of repeated unilateral
decisions by the Burkina institutions to sign expensive contracts with
consultants and to select consultants who were not adequately qualified for
the job required, would have been perfectly justified not to endorse these
decisions, and instead to suspend disbursements for these components.
5.06      Further Ba&k assistance to BND in the SME sector is not being
considered at this time. The closing of OPEV has left a vacuum in the
delivery of technical assistance to entrepreneurs, and existing institu-
tions promoting SMEs in Burkina lack the necessary motivation and Govern-
ment commitment and support to be of effective assistance to SME
development. Despite cooperation by the Groupe des Banques Populaires,
BND's accounts are still not in order.
5.07      To summarize, the following major lessons can be drawn from our
experience with this project:
(a) Projects involving institutions which do not have strong
Government commitment and support, and whose management is
significantly affected by political interference and
changes, stand little chance of successful implementation.
A strong institutional framework with clearly defined
accountability usually discourages the type of political
interference that affected so severely the institutions in
Burkina, where such a system did not exist.
(b) Projects which provide assistance toward institution
building, including the strengthening of the management of



- 11 -
project entities, require more intensive supervision
involving an appropriate skills mix.
(c) Technical assistance to an institution stands a better
chance of success when it finances qualified individuals in
line positions for relatively long periods of time, as
evidenced in one such case in this project. The remaining
technical assistance, financing ad hoc short-term advisory
or expert services, resulted only in marginal benefits.
(d) It is essential that institutions receiving technical
assistance have a capability to manage and internalize
technical assistance effectively. This was not the case
with the institutions involved in the project, as
demonstrated repeatedly during project implementation.
(e)  Greater care should be exercised by Bank staff in the
screening and selection of consultants.  In cases where the
Bank has strong reservations about the borrower's selection
of consultants on grounds of appropriate qualifications or
fees, the Bank ought to withhold its approval and where
Bank's advice is repeatedly disregarded it should seriously
consider suspension of disbursements on the relevant
component and cancellation of the remaining balance.
