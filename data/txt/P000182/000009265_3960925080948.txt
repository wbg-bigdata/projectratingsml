PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURUNDI - NICKEL EXPLORATION/ENGINEERING PROJECT
(Credit 1154-BU)
PREFACE
The IDA Credit 1154-BU (SDR 3.3 million, US$4.0 million
equivalent) provided financing to develop and analyze the basic data needed
to reformulate the large-scale Musongati Nickel Development Project
--including nickel exploration, trial peat production and engineering
studies, with the view of establishing a financially, technically and
economically viable project. The project was implemented satisfactorily by
the Ministry of Public Work, Energy and Mines formerly known as "Ministry
of Energy and Mines" with the assistance of various consultants.
Credit Agreement was amended in October 1985 to reflect two major
changes in the scope of the project: (i) due to lack of firm evidence to
confirm the existence of high grade zone, the number of holes to be drilled
in Stage II was reduced from 100 to 50; and (ii) the information developed
during the execution of the nickel exploration component (the deposit
proved less rich than anticipated) coupled with a poor nickel market
resulted in cancellation of the engineering studies component.
The Government of Burundi has prepared a PCR which has been
translated. This document is in broad agreement with this report and
provides more detail in some areas (such as work done prior to the project
or changes in nickel prices). Whenever relevant, these details have been
incorporated into the present report.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower for comments. These comments have been taken into account
in finalizing the report and are reproduced in Annex 2.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURUNDI - NICKEL EXPLORATION/ENGINEERING PROJECT
(CREDIT 1154-BU)
HIGHLIGHTS
Prior to independence, the share of mining sector in the economy
of Burundi wab instgnificant--less than 0.5% of GDP. Since 1968, the
Government--w;ith technical and financial assistance from bilateral
sources- has been undertaking extensive exploration of Burundi's mineral
potential, particularly peat and nickel occurrences, with the objective of
developing sufficient informstion to attract foreign investment. The
Nickel Exploration/Engineering project, initiated in late 1970s at the
Government's request, was designed to support the Government's objectives,
namely to confirm the availability of cheap indigenous energy in the form
of peat, and the existence of a high grade zone which could be min_.:d in the
early years of operation (paras. 1-5).
The project was appraised in November 1980 and consisted of three
major components--two of which were to be done in parallel and were to be
virtually completed before starting the third component.  The two were (i)
exploration of a high grade nickel zone at Musongati, and (ii) a trial
production of peat from the Akanyaru Bogs. The third component was to be a
group of five engineering studies. Recognizing the inherent risks in
mineral resource development, the project was phased so that the result of
each phase had to be evaluated before eommitting the next phase of work
(paras. 7, 11 and 16).
There was over one year delay between the Credit signing
(July 15, 1981) and its effectiveness on August 31, 1982, due to (i) time
required to secure the financing package, (ii) and lack of agreement
between IDA and the GOB on a consulting firm to manage the nickel
component. The overall project completion schedule was delayed by about 2
years and resulted in a cost overrun of 13% (paras. 17-20 and 25).
During project execution, two major changes in scope occurred:
(i) the results of drilling and sampling in the high grade zone indicated
that the zone was not as rich as originally believed (25% less nickel and
23% less tonnes of ore, or 42% less tonnes of nickel in the high grade
zone), therefore, it was agreed to reduce the number of holes to be drilled
in Stage II from 100 holes to 50; and (ii) the marginal nature of the
orebody coupled with lower market price for nickel, reduced the poential
attractiveness of this deposit to prospective mining investors, hence GOB
and IDA agreed to cancel the engineering study component. Part of the
funds released as a result of this cancellation were used to: (i) support
development of the other minerals; (ii) decommission the suction dredge
(used for peat excavation trials) for safe storage and future use; (iii)
supplement financing for the services of the nickel component manager; and
(iv) prepare and reproduce a report reviewing work done on the Musongati
deposit (paras. 21, 22).



-v-
On the whole, the Nickel Exploration and the Peat Production
Trial Components achieved their objectives.  The former led to the decision
not to execute the Engineering Studies component at that time, and the
latter demonstrated that peat can be produced from Burundi's valley bogs by
dredging, pumping, drying and harvesting the dried peat by conventional
peat harvesting techniques if future demand calls for it (paras. 39-40).
The economics of peat production (in particular as it relates to its import
component) should, however, be carefully reviewed before any final
decision.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRNID1 - NICKRL EXPLORATION/ENG111RIEG PROJECr
(CREDIT 1154 BU)
I . INTRODUCTION
1.        Burundi's mining sector .  the responsibility of the Ministry of
Public Works, Energy and Mines (MPWEM). Prior to independence, there were
several small mining operations. These shipped cassiterite (tin), and
bastnaesite (rare earths) concentrates. They were not a significant factor
in Burundi's economy--less than 0.5X of GDP. In recent years, these opera-
tions have ceased. The Ministry, with bilateral assistance, has pursued
the exploration of occurrences of tin, gold, rare earth, vanadium, phospho-
rus, peat, nickel and cement raw materials. In recent years, a private
company has explored for oil. With the exception of oil, occurrences of
all these minerals have been confirmed but none have been developed into a
producing mine.  The work to date has only defined the mineral potential.
The mining sector, with the exception of a small construction material
operation and peat, makes no contribution to the Burundi economy.
2.        The Government's aimn he" been the development of the identified
mineral potential. In the past, the major emphasis had been on the peat
and nickel occurrences. More recently the emphasis shifted to tin, gold
and rare earths.
3.        In 1968, UNDP geologists first realized the geological potential
for nickel in Burundi. Surface sampling strengthened this bel'ef. Drill-
ing campaigns in 1973 and 1976, financed by the UNDP, clearly established
the existence of nickel occurrences in the surface laterites in three
areas, Musongati, Waga and Nyabikere (see attached map). The Musongati
area indicated the greatest potential. Based on this preliminary
exploration, the UNDP in 1978 financed laboratory metallurgical tests and a
pre-feasibility study. The study results were favorable (due to some
rather optimistic assumptions) and led the Government of Burundi (GOB) in
1980 to finance pilot plant tests on about 700 tonnes of Musongati ore.
Proposals to put the nickel deposits into exploitation have been closely
associated with the study of Burundi's peat potential.
4.        Burundi has two kinds of peat bogs:  highland bogs, which can be
drained and harvested by conventional technology and much more extensive
valley bogs which car.not be totally drained and, therefore, the peat must
be dredged and pumped to a dry area to drain and dry before conventional
equipment can harvest it. With bilateral aid, the National Peat Bureau
(ONATOUR) has developed a 15,000 tonne per year peat operation harvesting
highland bogs.  But only the valley bogs would be large enough to support a
full industry such as a nickel plant.
5.        The Bank has followed and commented on these activities.
It did not, however, share the Government's optimistic view of nickel
potential. Primarily, it did not believe sufficient exploration had



-2-
been done to firmly establish the tonnage and nickel content of the nickel
occurrence. However, both IDA and GOB believed that confirming two key
features--the availability of cheap energy in the form of local peat and
the existence of a high-grade zone which could be mined in the early
years--would be necessary to make this deposit attractive for investment by
international mining companies, financial institutions and the Government.
The exploration/engineering credit under review here was intended to
confirm these two features and to develop the information needed to make a
sound decision on proceeding to a full bankable feasibility study.
6.        The Ministry of Public Works, Energy dId Mines was the executing
agency for this project. The Department of Geology and Mines had
responsibility for the nickel component and ONATOUR, a parastatal reporting
to the Ministry, had responsibility for the peat component. A Finnish
consulting company was engaged to manage the peat work and a firm from the
Federal Republic of Germany was engaged to manage the nickel work.
7.        The project consisted of three major components--two of which
would be done in parallel and be virtually completed before starting the
third. The two were exploration of a high-grade nickel zone at Musongati
and a trial production of peat from the Akanyaru Bogs. The third component
would be a group of engineering 3tudies.
8.        As originally conceived, the project required US$7.27 million of
financing. The Burundi Government financed all local costs. The Republic
of Finland (FINNIDA), UNDP and IDA agreed to finance the foreign costs of
the peat component. IDA agreed to finance the foreign costs of the nickel
component and the engineering studies.
9.        Circumstances developed which justified cancelling the
engineering studies (see para 21) and allocating a part of these IDA funds
to support the Ministry's plans to develop other mineral potential in
Burundi.
10.       The project had an extensive prologue which developed a number of
major reports   The project itself, though abbreviated, produced numerous
reports. A 1 v of all significant documents is given in Annex I.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION _PREPARZAION AND APPRAISAL
11.       Project preparation was materially advanced by previous work on
peat development financed by FINNIDA (excuted by a Finnish consulting
company) and on nickel prospects financed by GOB (executed by an American
consulting company). A study of international and internal transportation
and a study of the alternative use of coal from Kalemie (Zaire) were
originally proposed and dropped because, in IDA's view, they were not part
of the "minimum" information required at this time to assess the viability
of large-scale nickel development. R.ecognizing the inherent risks in
mineral resource development, the project was phased so that the result of
each phase had to be evaluated before committing the next phase of work.



-3-
12.       A financial/economical analysis of the full Musongati nickel
orojectl/ (real4zed in 1978-79 by a US consulting firm on the basis of
studies then existing) was a critical feature of IDA's appraisal.  The
analysis (in 1979 US dollars) indicated a 10-11% financial ROR and a 12-13%
economic ROR on a US$1,027 million investment, if ore containing 2.2%
nickel and peat, delivered at Musongati for US$75 per tonne, were
available.  If the project could demonstrate that this quality of ore and
price of peat were indeed tenable, it was believed that the international
mining community could be attracted to make the investment required to
develop the Muaongati Nickel Project.2/
13.       The principal goal of the exploration/engineering project was to
confirm the high-grade ore quality and availability, and to confirm that
peat could be delivered to a future nickel plant in quantity, quality and
price that was assumed in the financial analysis at the appraisal time.
The project consisted of three major components: (i) nickel exploration,
(ii) peat studies, and (iii) engineering studies.
14.       The nickel exploration component consisted of first drilling and
sampling 50 new holes in a high-grade zone which had been identified at
Musongati by earlier exploration. If these first 50 holes yielded
satisfactory results, an additional 100 holes were to be drilled.
15.       The peat component also had two steps.  The first was a Bog
Survey to sample and confirm the peat reserves at Buyongwe and Ndurumu and
to develop a detailed plan for a test excavation of peat. The second was
the execution of a peat production trial using equipment which could be
safely scaled up to a full commercial operation. This second step would
also help to prepare preliminary estimates of the amount, characteristics
and cost of del4-'-4"  neat to a nickel plant at Musongati.
16.       The third componert (as designed originally) consisted of five
engineering studies, to be initiated after the results of the nickel and
peat components were available. The studies were to develop more
information on: (i) the minability of the high-grade zone, (ii) the
potential of hydroelectric sites which might be dedicated to the Musongati
nickel project, (iii) the suitability of processes for extracting nickel
from Musongati lateritic ore, (iv) the availability of sulfur, an input
required for several extraction processes, and (v) the updated review of
the Musongati nickel project viability. During negotiations to obtain UNDP
cofinancing, the alternate fuel study (i.e. Kalemie (Zaire) coal) was
reintroduced into the program.
1/ In addition to nickel mine, plant facilities, and peat processing
facilities, the project included a large hydroelectric project with 13'
MW of installed capacity and 74 km transmission line; construction of
185 km new railroad from Musongati south to link up with the existing
railroad in Tanzania, and upgrading of 160 km highway from Butumburo to
Musongati as well as upgrading of 175 km of the navigaEion system on
Lake Tanganyika.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
17.       The credit was signed in July 1981, but credit effectiveness was
delayed more than a year by two problems--lack of full financing, and
agreement on a consulting firm to manage the nickel component. The delay
was caused by IDA's condition that the financing package be fully firmed up
prior to credit effectiveness. After the project scope was fully defined
by the Ministry, FINNIDA and IDA, the Government of Denmark (DANIDA) did
not believe there was a role for them which fit into their aid program and
withdrew. The credit was declared effective only after the Government
guaranteed to finance any short-fall. Shortly after effectiveness, the
Ministry's efforts resulted in UNDP agreeing to replace DANIDA in the
financing of the peat component.
18.       The other problem, which was solved prior to the Government's
financing guarantee, was caused by the Ministry's and IDA's difficulties in
agreeing on a suitable firm to manage the nickel exploration and
engineering studies. After debating the qualification and previous
experience of various possible firms, IDA and the Ministry finally agreed
in January 1982, on a consulting firm. On August 27, the Government
guaranteed to cover the short-fall, and on August 31, 1982, the Credit was
declared effective, 14 months after Credit signing.
19.       Another significant delay resulted from the loss of parts for the
suction dredge used for the peat component. The dredge was shipped through
Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Due to a general strike in Uganda, three of the
five trucks literally became lost. After investigation along the route,
they were found to be under military protection, but neither the Ministry,
the consulting firm, nor the transport company were able to learn their
fate for three months. This four-month delay complicated the trial
production schedule which had to be synchronized with the seasonal rains.
20.       Finally, the actual execution of the work also encountered some
delays. This resulted in work being completed about 2 years behind the
appraisal schedule.

The work schedule at appraisal was reasonable.  However, appraisal failed
to account for difficulties in completing the financing package and in



-5-
selecting the nickel component manager. Once work started, it took only
marginally longer than expected at appraisal. The Government reports
calculates that for drilling, appraisal estimates were 26.3 m/day at 232
SDR/m vs actual figures of 24.5 m/day at 275 SDR/m.
21.       Two major changes in scope occurred during execution of the
project. Both were caused by the unexpected results of nickel
exploration. The drilling and sampling in the high-grade zone indicated
the zone was not as high-grade as originally believed. The first 50 holes
of Stage I did exceed 1.6% nickel content which was a condition for
continuing Stage II, but were below the expected 2.2% nickel. It was thus
agreed to drill only 50 holes in Stage II rather than the planned 100
holes. The 50 holes of a reduced Stage II confirmed that the high-trade
zone had a nickel content of 1.66% at a 0.8% cut-off, where the earlier
exp'oration Phase I and II which preceded this project had indicated about
2.2% nickel at a 0.8% cut-off. There was little chance that, under such
circumstances, a mining company could be attracted to this deposit. The
deposit is marginal (See Section V). This, coupled with lower market price
for nickel, led to the IDA/Ministry agreement to cancel the engineering
study component. Perhaps in the future, if nickel prices increase, the
deposit could attract interest. The engineering studies could more
advantageously be cond-ected then.
22.       The broad intention of this credit was to assist the Ministry in
the development of Burundi's mineral resources. On cancellation of the
engineering studies, it was agreed to use part of the IDA funds (i) to
support development of other minerals by purchasing geological field and
laboratory equipment, by studying the local potential for phosphate use, by
executing the first phase of a plan to improve utilization of peat; (ii) to
decommission the suction dredge so it is safely stored for future use;
(iii) to provide additional financing for the services of the nickel
component manager; and (iv) to prepare and print extra copies of a report
reviewing work done to date on the Musongati deposit. On November 1, 1985,
the Credit Agreement was amended to authorize these changes.
23.       The reporting by consultants was satisfactory.  The component
managers promptly issued well written quarterly progress reports. However,
the monthly progress reports by the Ministry were less satisfactory, and
often no monthly report was issued for long periods. The Ministry
explained that their frequency of reporting was linked to the volume of
activities under the project and that reports were prepared only during the
drilling phase.
24.       A variety of procurement modes were used.  FINNIDA financed under
its own procedures most of consultants' work, the hiring of Finnish
technical experts and the procurement of Finnish peat harvesting
equipment. The IDA and UNDP funds were used under the Association's
Guidelines for procurement of equipment, works and consultants services.
The suction dredge costing about $600,000 was procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Laboratory equipment was procured
through international shopping. A small amount of office equipment was
procured through local procurement procedures and a few field vehicles



-6-
through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). The manager of the nickel
component was selected using the Association's Consultants' guidelines.
Shortly after the nickel manager was hired, it was agreed to contract all
drilling work rather than buying drilling equipment and hiring a contractor
to operate it. The drilling contractor was engaged under limited tendering
as defined in Schedule 3, Section B of the Credit Agreement. Except for
the difficulty agreeing on the se'1ction of the nickel component manager,
procurement was without serious problems.
25.       It is difficult to compare the projected overall costs with the
actual costs of an altered program. It is, however, evident that delays
did cause some cost overruns in the activities which were completed. The
costs for exe_uted components had about a 13% overrun and mostly due to
underestimation of the man-hours required to manage the nickel and peat
activities. Generally, the management overrun was due to difficulty in
getting the project started. The nickel manager used more time than had
been anticipated during appraisal. The firm insisted on maintaining an
administrative office with one expatriate and two locals full-time in
Bujumbura to support one. and occasionally two, of the firm's geologists at
Musongati. They believed this office was necessary in order to facilitate
mobilization-demobilization, local procurement, project accounting and
liaison with the Government. This was not anticipated at appraisal because
the drilling contractor was given responsibility for operating the camp at
Musongati and the Ministry was expected to give support to the geologist,
if necessary, by contracting part-time for a Burundian service group to
handle sample shipments.
nV.  SUMMARY OF PROJECT COSTS
26.       Completing the foreign cost financing package delayed project
effectiveness. At appraisal, it was believed that Denmark would
participate. However, after DANIDA dropp d out, it took some time to
arrange for UNDP to join as co-financier to complete the project
financing. At effectiveness, IDA offered SDR 3.3 million (US$4 million
equivalent), FINNIDA offered FIM 7.2 million (US$1.8 million equivalent)
and the UNDP offered US$0.84 million, for foreign cost financing. During
implementation, FINNIDA made two additional grants increasing their total
support to FIM 10.51 million (US$1.947 million equivalent). All of the
FINNIDA funds were disbursed, but US$2,331 of UNDP and SDR 0.08 (US$0.10
million equivalent) of IDA funds were cancelled due primarily to changes in
project scope.
27.       GOB offered to finance all local costs.  Moreover, in order to
prevent further delay of effectiveness, the Government pledged to finance
any foreign exchange short-fall. However, the UNDP financing made it
unnecessary for the Government to make any direct contribution of foreign
exchange. Table II summarizes the financing by activities for all
contributors and Table III summarizes the disbursement schedule of all
contributors. Because of delays in effectiveness and implementation,
disbursement extended about two years beyond the appraisal schedule.

28.       All project components were managed by consultants who generally
did a good job. Consultants prepared reports on alternative fuel, peat
utilization, phosphate market and Nickel Review Report, all of which were
completed in a professional manner. As mentioned previously, the only
problem was cost overrun for consultants' services linked to the
establishment of an office in Bujumbura to support field work. The
contractor engaged to carry out the drilling at Musongati did very good
work. The senior field geologist planning the nickel exploration and
directing the drillers also performed well. Service on the routine and
control sample analysis was satisfactory. However, the results were long
delayed due to the shipping time which was beyond the control of the
service firm.
V. OPERATING PERFORMNCE
29.       "Operating Performance" is not applicable to this exploration/
engineering project. The performance was good in terms of achieving the
objectives of the program. The objective was the development of the
information needed to make a sound decision on proceeding with the develop-
ment of the Musongati Nickel Project. The information developed in the
nickel exploration component, coupled with a poor nickel market,
contributed to the decision not to proceed further at this time.
30.       The results of the nickel exploration significantly lowered the
estimated reserves in the high-grade zone. Table IV presents the
calculated high-grade zone reserves based on the ten holes of the previous
drilling (Phase I and II) compared to 59 holes drilled in about the same
area during Phase III. Table IV also compares the results for Phases I and
II drilling on the entire Buhinda Plateau to Phase III for an expanded
high-grade zone. Based on the 0.8% nickel cut-off which was used in the
President's Report, the new results in the high-grade zone indicate 25%
lower nickel and 23% less tonnes of ore. The combination of the two
factors means there is about 42% less tonnes of nickel contained in the
high-grade zone than was believed at time of appraisal. The table also
indicates that the actual percentage of nickel in the so called high-grade
zone is just about the same as that on the entire Buhinda ore zone, i.e.,
there is no high-grade zone. The number of holes now drilled gives a
reliable basis for evaluating this deposit. The consultant's geologists
state that the reserves in the area they sampled (high-grade zone) are
proven".

1/   The results for Phases I and II included in the Government PCR show
higher ore tonnage (30.4 m'llion tonnes) and lower grades (1.8%/Ni)
than reported here. This difference arises from the fact that the
figures in this report were estimated on the basis of the original
UNDP geological data which covered a smaller area and contained only
high-grade ores. The Government figures correspond to a larger area,
including some average grade ore. The smaller sampling area used in
our report is totally contained within the area used in the Government
report. The differences are thus acceptable.
31.       Initially, it was believed that there was a sampiing error in the
ten holes of Phases I and II. Therefore, eight of the ten holes were
redrilled and sampled in Phase III. Phases I and II results were confirmed
as nearly correct. It appeared that ten holes were just too few to ensure
statistical significance.
32.       The results of the peat production trial were mre favorable.
The Bog Survey demonstrated that there are the equivalent of about 24
million tonnes of dried peat (enough for the commercial nickel plants)



-12-
within the area surveyed (Buyonjwe and Ndurumu) and the Peat Production
Trial demonstrated that the valley peat can be extracted by a cutter-lhead
suction dredge and then can be air dried and harvested in a usable form by
standard peat production equipment. Most importantly in the Burundi
context, the trial production proved that the drying and harvesting can be
done on an area of the drained bog rather than on the adjacent hillsides
which are now heavily populated and intensely farmed. Based on the results
of this trial production, the consultant estimated in 1985 dollars that
peat, at the normal 30% moisture, and 160 km truck transportation to
Musongati, can be produced for the cost shown in the following table.

Transport Costs a/
Tonnes Per Year         Production        US$/Tonne        Total

a!  By compairison, at the time this estimate was made (August 1985), the
international price of heavy oil was US$185 per TOE. Currently (June
1986), the international price is US$71.40 per TOE. However, these
prices do not include transport costs into Burundi. In December 1985,
fuel oil cost was about US$470/TOE delivered in Burundi. In addition
to the cost of delivered peat, the need for additional investments
(plant, silos, conveyors, and burners) at the site to ensure
substitutability with oil should be kept in mind in a comparative
analysis.

Phase III (5,539 meters) was:

34.       Also, the total costs of the Bog Survey for 5,200 hectares of
valley peat was about US$300,000 (of which US$247,000 foreign costs). The
Bog Environmental Impact Study costs about US$230,000 (of which US$170,000
were foreign costs). The Peat Production Trial costs about US$3,380,000
(of which US$2,922,000 were foreign costs). The Bog Survey which consisted
of determining the Bog level, marking sample grid, sampling and sample
analysis costs about US$57.70 per hectare of bog.

VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
35.       Except as noted at the end of this section, this exploration/
engineering project is not subject to financial analysis criteria.
However, the projections of financial performance for a full Musongati
nickel mine and processing plant were a major factor in cancelling the
engineering studies. The projected financial return of the Musongati
Nickel Project is discussed below.
36.       As stated in paragraph 2.02, at appraisal, it was believed that a
US$1,027 million investment in the Musongati nickel project capable of
processing 2,030,000 tonnes per year of ore would yield a 10% to 11%
financial ROR or a 12% to 13% economic ROR. At the end of Pnase III, the
prices of nickel, cobalt and copper all had dropped as had the estimate of
the percentage of nickel in the high-grade ore. Thus, a significant
decrease in income reduced the estimated ROR to a negative value. At the
time of preparation of this PCR, metal prices had fallen further. The only
positive factor was the decrease in the estimated cost of peat delivered to
Musongati, which had dropped from about US$75 per tonne at appraisal to
about US$35 per tonne in August 1986 (Project Completion time). Despite
this cost improvement, the lower metal prices resulted in aa even lower
ROR. Table V cumpares the pertinent data and the ROR as they changed with
new information.
37.       There was an economical benefit to the investment in the Peat
Production Trial. However, it is impossible to quantify it. As the bag
was drained to prepare for the test, the edge of the bog adjacent to the
hillsides became dry enough to farm. During the trials, which took place
near the center of the bog, local people were growing beans on the new
farm-land along the edges.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEmVLOPMENT
38.       The project's contribution to institution building was
insignificant. Almost all the management responsibilities fell on the
consultants. With the exception of a poor record with monthly progress
reports (see para. 3.07), the Ministry's coordinators for the peat and
nickel components did a good job. Also the counterpart personnel working
with the consultants acquired valuable experience in both peat and nickel
exploration, and peat production technology.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
39.       The Nickel Exploration and the Peat Production Trial components
achieved their objectives. Both developed the information required to make
a decision on continuing the development of the full Musongati Nickel
Project.
40.       The information developed by the Nickel Exploration component,
coupled with the poor market for the Musongati products--nickel, cobalt and
copper--led to the decision not to execute the Engineering Studies
component of this project. The geological data developed in the
exploration component remains valid until the market conditions improve
enough to make the Musongati nickel an attractive investment.
41.       The Peat Production Trial did demonstrate that peat can be
produced from Burundi's valley bogs by dredging, pumping, arying and
harvesting the dried peat by conventional peat harvesting techniques.
Should quantities of fuel peat be required beyond what can be supplied by
the current highland peat operations, they can be supplied from the valley
bogs using the dredge techniques developed in this project. A careful
detailed economic analysis of any project (in particular in terms of its
import requirements) ought to be undertaken before any final decision.

From:    FINNIDA
Helsinki
Ref:     Project Completion Report on Nickel Exploration/Engineering
Project in Burundi (Credit 115) your letter of December 22, 1987.
Dear Sir,
Beneath please find FINNIDA's comments and proposals on the PCR mentioned-
above-which you might wish to take into consideration when finalizing the
Report.
QUOTE
1. Cheap, indigenous energy
In paragraph 1 of the 'Highlights" the report specifies one of the
objectives of the project as "to confirm the availability of cheap
indigenous energy in the form of peat."
In paragraph 5 of the same section, the report states that "On the
whole, the Nickel Exploration and the Peat Production Trial Components
achieved their objectives." Even though the report continues that the
tested peat production technology proved workable without mentioning
costs or import content, the conclusion might be drawn that peat,
generally, is a cheap and indigenous form of energy.
In certain circumstances peat can, without doubt, offer a competitive
alternative to oil, but in a developing country the tested technology
inevitably leads to a high import content of the peat because usually
all equipment, including transport equipment, spares and fuel are
imported and the only indigenous cost element is labour. Labour's
share of the total costs varied in the calculations between 8 and 14
percent, depending on the production capacity.
Furthermore, peat cannot straight away substitute for oil. Peat
requires additional investment in plant, i.e. silos, conveyors and
burners as a minimum. Hence, the basis of the cost comparison between
heavy oil and peat (para. 32) is not entirely appropriate.



ANNEX 2
-21-                      Page 3 of 3
Even though FINNIDA does not challenge the validity of the findings
and conclusions of the report under project circumstances. FINNIDA
would appreciate if the final report could reflect the above aspects
in order to prevent prospective developers of fuel peat resources from
drawing too hasty conclusions concerning the economics and foreign
exchange saving capacity of peat.
2.   Technicalities
Re: *Abbreviations":
FINNIDA is an abbreviation of the Finnish International Development
Agency
Re: "Highlights":
In paragraph 4 of the "Highlights" the report claims that the high
grade zone was not a high grade as originally believed (42Z less
nickel per tonne), whereas the corresponding information in the report
proper (para. 30) reads 'Based on the 0.8Z cut-off which was used in
the President's Report, the new results in the high grade zone
indicate 252 lower nickel and 232 less tonnes of ore. The combination
of the two factors means there is about 422 less tonnes of nickel
contained in the high grade zone than was believed at time of
appraisal."
Re: "Table 1":
Line "Grand Total Costs", column "Actual, Foreign" the correct amount
is 6.689 (typing error).
UNQUOTE
As a whole, I find the Report to be explicitly and efficiently compiled for
which I wish to thank you and your office.
Yours sincerely,
