ECUADOR
APPRAISAL OF
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT FOR GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE
EMPRESA MUNICIPAL DE AGUA POTABLE DE GUAYAQUIL
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a US$38.3 million equivalent
water supply project for Guayaquil and part of Guayas Province in Ecuador,
a region with a population of about 1.2 million people. One million of
them live in Guayaquil, the largest city of Ecuador, its major commercial
and industrial center and most important port. A Bank loan of US$23.2
million is proposed, covering the estimated foreign exchange cost of
the Project.
ii.       Guayaquil's population is increasing at the rate of 5.6%
annually. The water system serves approximately 500,000 people; the
balance of the cityts population, most of which live in the low-income
area, is not served by the municipal water supply. Of the 128,000
"rural" population, about 35% receive water service.  The quality of
service is deficient because of excessive losses and inadequate capacity
of the water supply system. Water service will deteriorate further
unless facilities are expanded.
iii.      The Project consists of improvements to the water treatment,
transmission and distribution facilities for Guayaquil, and the con-
struction of transmission and distribution facilities for the Santa
Elena Peninsula, whose 76,000 mostly rural low-income inhabitants
do not receive water service now, and for the 14,000 inhabitants of
Daule. Construction, engineering and administration are estimated to
cost US$38.3 million. The Bank loan would cover 61%, the balance
would be financed through municipal and national grants (20%) and
internal cash generation (19%).
iv.       All of the materials and services to be financed out of the
proceeds of the loan would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Because of a need to use suppliers' credits to finance
investments, EMAP in the past did not separate supply and civil works
contracts. As a consequence, most contracts were won by foreign
contractors. The Bank loan will permit increased participation by
local contractors who are expected to win about 50% of the civil works
contracts. Most of the contracts for equipment supply, valves and
accessories, valued at about 40% of the total project cost, will
probably be won by foreign firms.
v.        The Borrower will be the Empresa de Agua Potable de
Guayaquil (EMAP), an autonomous municipal entity.
vi.       The Project is the least-cost altermative, at any discount
rate, for providing the project area with an adequate supply of water.



- ii -
vii.      Provided the conditions listed in Chapter 8 are met, the
Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.2 million equivalent for
a term of 25 years, including a four-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT FOR GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE
EMPRESA MUNICIPAL DE AGUA POTABLE DE GUAYAQUIL
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ecuador has requested a Bank loan to help
finance the first stage of a long-range water supply program for the
city of Guayaquil, the largest of the country and its major port.
This would be the first project in the water supply sector in Ecuador
to be financed by the Bank. The Borrower would be the Empresa Municipal
de Agua Potable de Guayaquil (EMAP), an autonomous municipal entity
sumolying water to Guayaquil and other towns in the Province of Guayas.
The US$23.2 million proposed loan, which represents 61% of the estimated
project cost of US$38.3 million, would cover 100% of the foreign exchange
component and would be for a period of 25 years including 4 years of
grace and would be guaranteed by the Republic of Ecuador.
1.02      The Project would permit EMAP to increase water supply ser-
vices from 50% to 80% of the population of the city of Guayaquil by
1977, serving an incremental population of residents in Guayaquil,
the city of Daule, expand the service in the city of Daran, and also
serve the permanent and seasonal population of the major communities
of the Santa Elena Peninsula, a summer resort for Guayaquil and the
country, now without public water supply. The Project would improve
water service for 452,000 people and serve an additional 102,000 popu-
lation in the project area by 1977.
1.03      In July 1973, a preappraisal mission visited Guayaquil to
evaluate the status of the preparation of the Project and EMAPts
capacity to execute it. Additional information and studies were
requested from EMAP and, following the receipt of this data, a mission
composed of Messrs. Alfonso Zavala, Lars Jeurling and Claudio Fernandez
(consultant) appraised the Project in Guayaquil in October 1973. Mr.
Jeffrey Balkind from the Transportation and Urban Projects Department
also participated in the mission to evaluate the urban development
aspects of the Project and supervise the work of two urban consultants.
1004      Following review by the mission, project components were
defined, construction programs rescheduled and cost estimates revised
and updated by the engineering staff of EMAP and consultants. This
report is based upon this information and the findings and studies of
the mission.

2. THE SECTOR
2,01      The development of the sanitation sector in Ecuador has been
adversely affected by inadequate institutions and a lack of organization,
both at the central and local levels, and a lack of financial resources.
The Ecuadorian Institute for Sanitary Works (IEOS) estimates that in
1973, out of a total population of 6.8 million, 65% of the urban popu-
lation and 10% of the rural population had access to public water supply,
and some 60% of the urban population was served by sewerage, Sewerage
is almost nonexistent in rural areas. The existing deficiencies in
water and sewer facilities result in a high incidence of water-borne
diseases and high-infant mortality rates, according to IEOS (statistics
not available).
2.02      The present urban population of about 3,000,000 inhabitants
is expected to increase to over 4,000,000 in 1980, with consequent large
investment needs in the urban sanitation sector. The rural population
is defined to consist of the population living outside of the capital
of the canton (mostly communities with less than 2,000 inhabitants and
scattered population).
2.03      In the seven large cities - Guayaquil, Quito, Cuenca, Ibarra,
Ambato, Esmeraldas and Loja, water supply and sewerage is the responsi-
bility of autonomous municipal entities, "Empresas". Municipal councils,
under the supervision of IEOS, are responsible for water services in
the other urban communities. In rural areas, water supply and sewerage
are handled by local councils supervised by the Ministry of Health.
2.04      IEOS and the National Planning Board are responsible for
sector planning. IEOS is responsible for financing, project prep-
aration and construction of water supply and sewerage systems in
communities of 2,000 inhabitants or larger. For the seven cities
mentioned, its activities are limited to approving feasibility
studies. The Institute also provides technical assistance to the
municipalities. In the past, the activities of the IEOS have
been seriously hampered by a lack of financial resources from
central government contributions 1/. IEOS has now an earmarked
share of the oil royalties, (with the present price and production,
it is estimated that this source of funds would provide S/80 million
a year), which alleviate its financial problems.
2.05      The first national sanitation program (1966-1972) prepared
by IEOS concentrated on the urban centers over 2,000 inhabitants.
Out of the total planned investments of about S/1.5 billion, 77% was
1/ Out of S/85 million budgeted for capital investments in 1966-1972,
only 500,000 have been available because the Government has preferred
to channel the funds available for the sector outside IEOS and
limited the functions of the latter to technical assistance.



-3-
actually invested.  International loans, mainly from IDB, accounted for
almost 40% of the total financing and local government financing for about
40h    Central government contributions (IEOS included) were about 20%.
IEbS built facilities that accounted for about 15% of the total invest-
ments, and the "sempresas" facilities for the remaining 85%.
20o6      The objective of the second program (1973-1977), now being
implemented by IEOS, is to serve 50% of the total population with water
(80% in urban areas, 25% in rural areas) and 40h% writh sewerage (70% in
urban areas, 14% in rural areas).  S/2.2 billion (US$88 million)
are to be invested over the 5-year period (some 95% in urban areas),
Local government contributions and international loans are each planned
to finance slightly over 40% of the program; central government contri-
butions, less than 15% and internal cash generation, less than 5%.
2.07      In order to carry out this program, a revolving fund for
urban and rural sanitation has recently been created. The fund
is administered by IEOSo The fund, through which most of the development
program for the sector will be financed, will be funded from central
and local government contributions, petroleum royalties and inter-
national loans.
2.08      Until now, IDB and supplierst credits have been the main inter-
national source of finance for the sector.  IDB loans were made for idater
supply in Quito (US$7 million in 1963  and US$18.8 million in 1972) and
sewerage in Guayaquil (US$7.6 million). A US$11 million IDB loan for
water supply and sewerage for small and medium-sized cities has
recently been made effective.
2.09      The major problEns of the sector are:
(i)  Revenues generated within the sector cover operation
and mai_tenance of the systems but, as a whole, are
inadequate to cover depreciation; even less earn a
rate of return on net fixed assets;
(ii) IEOS has little demonstrated capacity to prepare and
execute projects and would need to be substantially
strengthened to carry out the ambitious national sani-
tation plan. Most local institutions are also weak;
(iii) The existing training program is inadequate to meet
the needs of the national plan; and
(iv) Domestic consulting firms, contractors and industry
have limited capacity to design and execute projects
and supply the materials necessary to carry out the
plan.
A WHO-Bank technical assistance mission will visit Ecuador
later this year to review sector needs and assist IEOS to make insti-
tutional improvements, establish training programs, etc.



2.10      The proposed project would be the vehicle for institutional
improvements in the Guayaquil area, and would permit the establishment
of a financially self-sufficient water operatian without need for govern-
ment subsidies through earmarked taxes or direct budgetary contributions,
resources that could be used to finance social projects such as rural
water supply programs.

3. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY OF GUAYAQUIL
Existing Water Supply Facilities
3.01      EMAP is the water supplier for the entire Guayas Province and
its capital, Guayaquil.  It supplies about 50% of the population (476,ooo)
of Guayaquil, and about 48% (62,000) of the population of the "rural"
towns of Naranjito, Milagro, Ingenio San Carlos, Yaguachi and Duran
(Eloy Alfaro).
3.02      The source of water for Guayaquil is the Daule River.  The
minimum dry weather flow observed during the last 50 years is
13.3 m3/sec, well above the expected demand for the year 2000
for Guayaquil and the Santa Elena Peninsula. Five brooks, 95 km
east of Guayaquil, yielding over 0.4 m3/sec, are sufficient to provide
water supply demands for the other towns up to 1985.
3.03      Water distributed in auayaquil is treated in the La Toma
water treatment plant, located 23 km north of the city, through a
conventional sedimentation and rapid sand filtration system producing
140,000 mn /day, and a solid contact reactor and rapid sand filtration
system with a capacity oL 80,000 rin/day.  The rural towns are served
from the Lolita water treatment plant, a plain sedimentation and slow
sand filtration facility located 54 kcn east of the Guayas River.
3.o4      The water distribution system in Guayaquil is unsatisfactory;
extensive leakage in the downtown network and other sections of the city
are causing high losses and low pressure service (6 to 10 psi) in most
of the distribution network. The great amount of unaccounted-for water,
due to excessive consumption by unmetered customers and leakage in the
distribution system is illustrated in the following tabulation:
m3/d      %
Production                                           196,000  100
Residential consumption
(unmetered consumption estimated
on the basis of average metered
consumption)                                          79,000   4o
Commercial and industrial consumption                 25,000   13
Unaccounted-for water                                 92,000   47
Of the 92,000 m3/d unaccounted-for water, three quarters (36% of
production) are estimated to be lost through leaks in the system,
21,000 m3/d (11% of production), through waste by unmetered
consumers.



-6-
3.o5      Existing reservoir capacity in Guayaquil is 94,000 m3 and
represents 31% of the average daily production required by 1980. This
is considered adequate because the city is served by a separate water
supply for fire protection and the system is connected to the treatment
plant by two parallel transmission mains.
3.06      Operation and maintenance of the water production facilities
is good, and failures in the distribution system are quickly repaired.
3.07.     Water meter maintenance and repair is inadequate:  12% of the
existing meters are known to be defective, are not being repaired and
should be replaced. The meter maintenance shop has a limited capacity
for calibration and repairs, although personnel is well-trained. BEAP
is now in the process of purchasing two-meter testing and repair benches
and intends to establish a meter maintenance program. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that such a program be established by
December 31, 197h.
Sewerage System
3.08      Sewerage services for the city of Guayaquil are provided by
the Municipality (Concejo Cantonal de Guayaquil), through the Municipal
Sewerage Company of Guayaquil (EMAG), an autonomous entity, presently
only acting as the executive administrative agency for a US$7.6 million
loan from IDB, in a first sewerage project with a total cost of US$13.1
million.
3.09      Maintenance and operation of the sewerage systems serving
Guayaquil and other towns, are legally EMAG's responsibility, and are
being carried out by the Municipality without any charge to the users
for the services provided,
3.10      The sanitary sewerage system of Guayaquil serves only 200,000
inhabitants (about 4&% of the population served with water supply). After
the IDB financed project is completed in 1975, an additional 200,000 people
would be served.
3.11      EMAG is presently preparing a second loan application to IDB
to finance a project of S/800 million (US$32 million) for a second stage
of the sanitary sewerage system, the first stage of a storm drainage system,
a suburbio earthfill project, and the paving of certain primary roads
(Estructura Vial Basica).
Urban Development Plan
3.12      Because of the lack of municipal urban planning and ineffective
development controls, public utility service expansion in Guayaquil has
not followed a rational plan.   EMAP has been extending services to
residential and industrial areas under political pressures and
"de facto" situations, especially in the northern part of



-7-
the city.  The low-income population migrating to the city has been con-
centrating in the western zone of Guayaquil (El Suburbio), an area which
now has an estimated population of 400,000 inhabitants, and where basic
sanitation services are deficient because tidal swamplands cover large
areas.  In October 1973, the Municipality and UNDP signed a contract for
the preparation of an Urban Development Plan for Guayaquil. EMAP intends
to participate in the preparation of this plan and will use it as a basis
for the Project's proposed water supply master plan to year 2000. Urban
planning is further discussed under para. 4.16.
Waterworks Under Construction
3.13      EMAP has contracted some important waterworks, now under con-
struction, to satisfy existing needs of the low-income population.  These
facilities are not part of the Bank project and are financed by EMAP
(see paragraph 3.14).  The objectives of these works are:
(i)  to construct by March 1975 water supply facilities and
30,000 house connections (not including meters) in the
"suburbio" for an estimated population of 300,000 in-
habitants scattered over an area of 1,200 hectares.
(The supply and installation of meters for these con-
nections are to be financed from the proposed Bank
loan - see para. 4.04);
(ii) to serve the southern part of Guayaquil up to Puerto
Maritimo, including potential urban development of the

Institute of Social Security and the Housing Bank;
(iii)  to increase from 220,000 to 320,000 m3/day the capacity
of the La Toma water treaument plant by modification to
the sedimentation basins and construction of other im-

rate (expansion of the filtration facilities is included
in the Bank project);
(iv)  to increase the raw water pumping capacity from the Daule
River to the La Toma treatment plant from 220,000 to
320,000 m3/day;
(v)  to install 25,000 water meters through the end of 1974
to eliminate the existing unmetered house connections in
the central area of the city.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that all these
works be executed and completed as planned.

3.14      The financing of these waterworks has been provided as follows:
(i)  the construction of a transmission main up to Puerto
Maritimo, distribution system for the "suburbio" and
house connections, through a suppliers' credit from
SOCEA-HALBERGERHUTTE, a french-german joint venture,
for S/195,000,000 (US$7.8 million), of which 25% is to
be paid during the construction period (September 1971 -
March 1975) and 75% in five more years, up to 1980, at
an interest rate of 8%;
(ii)  the increase of the sedimentation capacity of La Toma
treatment plant, contracted at S/16.25 million (US$o.65
million), using current funds from EMAP's 1973 and
1974 budget; and
(iii)  the purchase and installation of new pumping equipment
and water meters from EMAP's current funds, to be
disbursed in 1973 and 1974, for a total of S/43.8
million (US$1.75 million).

4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The Project is the first stage of a long-range program.  It
would be carried out in three and a half years, 1974-1977, and would
have the objectives of:
(i)  providing water supply to 80% (960,000 inhabitants)
of Guayaquilts 1977 population, concentrating primarily
on extending service to low-income families in the
"suburbio";
(ii)  serving the towns of Duran and Daule where, by 1977,
an additional population of 35,000 inhabitants would
benefit from the Project; and
(iii)  supplying water to the Santa Elena Peninsula towns,
including some small villages (rural population)
located along the road from Guayaquil to Santa
Elena, serving about 60% of. a 1977 resident popu-
lation of 43,000 and 100% of a tourist population
of 24,000 of the same year.
The second stage would start in 1978 to cover the needs of
Guayaquil and other Guayas Province cities up to the year 2000. For
this purpose, a master plan for the year 2000 and a feasibility study
to cover the needs up to 1985 would be prepared during the first stage
of the Project (see para. 4.16).
4.02      Four hundred thousand people live in the "suburbio" area of
Guayaquil without adequate water supply. Three hundred thousand live
in an area where a distribution system is now under construction (see
para. 3.13). One hundred thousand live in the Suburbio West, for
which the Bank project will provide facilities. This is a squatter
area west of the city, prone to flooding. The settlement has been
partially upgraded and further improvements are in progress. The
inhabitants of this area will be the major beneficiaries of the Bank
project.
4.03      The towns of the Santa Elena Peninsula, Playas (General
Villamil), Salinas, Santa Elena, La Libertad and Ballenita (see
map), are attractive to tourists during the warm season from
January to April because of the beauty of its beaches. Their
permanent population of 76,000 inhabitants (and another 24,000
temporary residents) obtains water mqstly from water tank trucks
at a very high cost, often at S/60/mJ (US$2040/m3), that is, 24
times the average cost of residential users in Guayaquil. This water
is contaminated and comes from shallow, unprotected wells 30 to 50 k1m
away,



-10-
4.04      The principal elements of the Project are detailed in Annex 1,
and summarized below:
(i) interconnection of the force-main system of 16"', 42'1
and 50"V diameter pipelines to convey an average of
320,000 m3/day raw water to La Toma water treatment
plant;
(ii)  increase the La Toma filtration rate to 320,000
m3/day;
(iii)  purchase and installation of 15,000 im of a 72t1 diameter
transmission main between La Toma and Tres Cerritos
Reservoir, to increase the capacity of the transmission
system (with existing 42"' and 50"s transmission mains)
to 320,000 m3/day;
(iv)  pipe replacement and distribution ne-twork improvements
in downtown Guayaquil, Urdesa and other sections where
existing pipes have been corroded;
(v)  expansion of the distribution system in Eloy Alfaro
(Duran), Santa Ana, Mapasingue and the Suburbio West,
to serve low-income population, new low-cost housing
projects of the Ecuadorian Institute of Social
Security and the Housing Bank, and other new urban
developments to relocate people living in substandard
areas in Guayaquil;
(vi)  installation of a water supply service to the nearby
town of Daule for a design population of 24,000 in-
habitants;
(vii)  construction of a water system for the Santa Elena
Peninsula, with a total capacity of 25,000 m3/day
(see Annex 1);
(viii)  purchase and installation of 30,000 water meters in
the "suburbiott area, where a water distribution system
is now being installed (see para. 3.13);
(ix)  water supply Master Plan for Guayaquil and other areas
served to year 2000 and a feasibility study to the
year 1985.
4.05      The communities to be served on the Santa Elena Peninsula
are located from 50 to 120 km from Guayaquil. Available studies and
a preliminary review of desalination costs indicate that neither
desalination nor groundwater are feasible. However, contrary to con-
clusions presented in earlier reports, EMAP is now successfully ab-
stracting limited amounts of groundwater in the peninsula. If sufficient
groundwater could be found to serve the-town of Playas, the Project
could be reduced by about US$2.0 million. In the less likely event
that the towns of Salinas, Libertad, Ballenita and Santa Elena could



-ll-
also be served with groundwater, the cost saving could be as much as
US$5.0 million. Consequently, EMAP's consultants are now conducting
groundwater and desalination studies which would be retroactively
financed by the Bank to determine whether these two methods could
assist in solving the peninsula's water supply problem. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that no construction will be under-
taken on the Santa Elena Peninsula water supply project component
for which designs, specifications and tender documents have been
prepared, until EMAP's consultants finish the studies and satis-
factorily demonstrate to the Bank that the most economical solution
has been selected. The presently proposed solution would be modified,
if necessary, to reflect the results of these studies.
4.06      Unaccounted-for water in the rural area served from the
Lolita water treatment plant is estimated at 79% (see Annex 4). It
is caused by excessive leakage, lack of meters (only 22% of house
connections metered) and clandestine installations, During the rainy
season, the slow sand filtration plant cannot properly treat the raw
water high turbidity. The master plan would include studies for the
area served by the Lolita plant and recommend improvements to the
plant, transmission and distribution facilities.
4.07      The estimated cost of the Project is detailed in Annex 1,
and summarized below. The corresponding investment schedule is shown
in Annex 2.

-12-
4.08      The estimates are based on designs prepared by EKAP and its
consultants, cost estimates updated during the appraisal, and suppliers'
cost quotations of equipment and material. Local and foreign exchange
components were established on the basis of current works being carried
out by EMAP contractors in water distribution, reservoirs, transmission
mains and treatment plant improvements. Based on this information, the
foreign exchange component of the Project is estimated to be 60% of the
of the total cost (65% for physical works and studies, 33% for engineering
and administration). All costs have been adjusted for 1974 prices.
Physical contingencies of 15% on directly imported equipment and civil
works reflect potential additional costs which may arise during detailed
design and construction of some of the project components. Price con-
tingencies of 10% per annum for local cost and 6% per annum for the
foreign exchange component of the Project have been allowed, reflecting
local inflation and estimated inflation in suppliers' countries.
Should price contingencies rise more than estimated, the distribution
component of the Project would be reduced by the amount of such contin-
gency increase.
Amount of Proposed Loan
4.09      A loan for US$23.2 million, equal to 61% of the total project
cost of US$38.3 million, is proposed in order to finance 100% of the
foreign exchange component of the Project. interest during construction
on the loan, amounting to US$3.15 million, local costs, and engineering
and administrative costs, equivalent to US$18,5 million, would be financed
by EMAP.
Procurement
4.10      All material, equipment, civil works and services to be financed
out of the proceeds of the proposed loan would be procured after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
For purposes of bid comparison, the Bank's preferential rules would
applicable to local and regional suppliers. Ecuadorian suppliers of
equipment and material will be eligible for preference equal to the
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt
importer would have to pay for the importation subject to a ceiling of
15%. The Bank loan will permit competitive bidding without a requirement
that the successful bidder finance the cost through suppliers' credits,
and will thus encourage and enable the competent local contractors to
participate in the construction of the works.



-13-
Disbursement
4.11      The Bank would disburse the loan against the CIF costs of
all direct imports, the foreign exchange cost of the consultants'
services, and up to 25% of the civil works. The cost of the
water resources studies on the Santa Elena Peninsula and final
designs of the Project being done by consultants would be reimbursed
retroactively from the loan account up to a maximum of US$100,000
for expenses incurred after December 1, 1973.
Project Supervision and Administration
4.12      Detailed design, cost estimates and tender documents for
the construction contracts are being prepared by the technical staff
of EMAP and the consulting engineers, Buck, Seifert and Jost, from
USA, a firm acceptable to the Bank. Contract administration and
construction supervision would be done by EMAP with the assistance
of qualified consulting engineers. During negotiations, agreement
was reached with EMAP that, prior to the award of contracts, they
should engage consulting engineers, satisfactory to the Bank,
for the supervision of the construction contracts for the treatment
plant improvements, and the transmission main from La Toma to
Guayaquil.
Environmental Aspects
4.13      The Project would increase water supply in the metropolitan
area of Guayaquil, improving service to the poorer areas of the city,
presently without an adequate supply and would eliminate or substantially
reduce the need to purchase contaminated water from tank trucks.
Similar improvements would be achieved in Duran, Daule, and especially
the Santa Elena Peninsula.
4.14 1Parallel to the Project, the Municipality of Guayaquil,
through EMAG, would be providing sanitary and storm water sewers to
the city, improving the cityts environment0
Urban Development Considerations and Studies
4.15      Comprehensive urban planning and specific urban programs
are lacking in Guayaquil, impeding the identification of areas where
the water supply and sewerage systems should be extended. For this
reason, it has not yet been possible to specify in the Project, at
the present time, as much of a water distribution component as desirable
to fulfill the social and economic objectives of serving as many low-
income people as possible.  This refers in particular to the "suburbio"
and other low-income areas, where the alternative of preventing new
settlements or relocating the existing population to more suitable
living areas should be investigated, befcre a decision to extend the
distribution system can be made. Thus, there is an immediate need
for studies to establish how and where the city should grow.



-14-
4.16      UNDP plans to make a grant of Us$600,000 to the Municipality
of Guayaquil for a comprehensive urban development study of the metro-
politan area. So far, US$90,000 have been committed for preliminary
work by UNCHBP, leading to a definition of the scope of the work to
be undertaken and terms of reference for consultants to be selected
thereafter to execute the study. Meanwhile, the Bank is discussing
the scope and orientation of the study with the UNCHBP. Annex 13
outlines the major areas which the Bank considers should be covered
by this study.
4.17      EMAP will base its long-range water supply master plan and
feasibility studies for the 7-year program of works beginning in 1978
on the UNDP urban master plan. In addition, the UNDP study will be
the basis for EMAP decisions on the expansion of water distribution
facilities representing about 15% of the Bank project. In view of the
long lead time necessary for urban development plans to have a signi-
ficant impact on population growth and settling patterns, it is
unlikely that more than about a third of the proposed distribution
system expansion (5% of project cost) would be modified by these studies.
Because the scope and terms of reference for the UNDP master plan
study are not yet defined, the Bank project includes funds to enable
EMAP to undertake, in addition to the water supply master plan and
feasibility studies, urban studies necessary to provide the infor-
mation EMAP requires as a basis for its master plan and distribution
system studies. The studies which should be part of the UNDP master
plan study, but which might have to be done by EMAP, are the following:
(i)  a study of the costs and benefits of upgrading
squatter areas (including expansion of existing
areas), especially in the "suburbio"l and Mapazingue
(another low-income area);
(ii)  as an alternative to further "suburbio'" extension,
feasibility studies for the extension of infra-
structure facilities to other areas of the city,
which could be utilized for low-income housing,
such as El Guasmo, Mapazingue, Urdesa in the north,
and in Duran in the east across the Guayas River; and
(iii)  a socioeconomic study to establish consumers' capacity
to pay public utilities and land tenure in low-income
areas.
4.18      The studies to be carried out by EMAP would be the evaluation
of alternate sources of supply for the Santa Elena Peninsula described
in paragraph 4.05 and the water supply master plan. The latter should
be based on the development of Guayaquil foreseen in the UNDP urban
master plan and would:
(i) Review population growth and urban development and
determine water demand in EMAP's service area;



(ii)  Evaluate water resources, in particular the adequacy
of supply from the Daule River. Demand for irrigation
water from the Daule River could reduce the amount of
water available for Guayaquil and potential conflicts
should be resolved and/or other sources of water
evaluated;
(iii) Establish a long-range water supply program to the year
2000 and a 7-year investment plan, beginning in 1978,
including feasibility studies for the works proposed
in the 7-year investment program;
(iv)  Establish the feasibility of distribution system
components of this project in areas which could be
utilized for low-income housing in Duran and Guayaquil's
districts of El Guasmo, Mapazingue and Urdesa.
(Fifteen percent of the project funds are allocated
to this distribution system component.);
(v) Recommend improvements to the Lolita treatment plant
and the transmission and distribution systems served
by the plant; and
(vi) Review long-range sewage disposal plans of EMAG and
recommend solutions to possible corflicts between
EMAP and EMAG long-range programs.
The funds included in the Project, US$600,000, are sufficient
for the studies discussed above and in paragraph 4.05. Should the
UNDP master plan include the studies discussed in paragraph 4.17 (i),
(ii) and (iii), the funds not required would be used for additional
distribution system expansion.
4.19      The lack of urban planning in Guayaquil is caused by the
weakness and lack of coordination among municipal institutions
responsible for planning, project execution and operation. In
particular, the office of Municipal Planning (Planeamiento) is not
executing its planning role and appears to have lost the confidence
of the Mayor. Although reform of institutions involved in the urban
development of Guayaquil is not within the scope of the present
project, EMAP should contribute towards a workable urban development
program. The Bank should closely follow the execution of the UNDP
study and the implementation of its recommendations to assure that
institutional improvements will be recommended and implemented.
In particular, the UNDP-financed urban study should make recom-
mendations on how to strengthen the overall planning and execution
of urban investments in Guayaquil.



-16-
5. JUSTIFICATION
5O01      The Project is necessary to cover the immediate and inter-
mediate water supply needs of the cities of Guayaquil, Daule, Duran,
and those on the Santa Elena Peninsula. In addition, portions of
the distribution network in central Guayaquil and Urdesa are badly
corroded and need replacements to eliminate excessive leakage; almost
50% of the water produced is lost in leakage through pipes and house
coniections, which is reflected in the low revenue effectiveness
index (REI) of 33% for 1973 (see para. 6.08). Pressure in the distri-
bution system is kept as low as 5-6 psi to reduce leakage and service
is reduced nightly to some areas to replenish reservoirs.
5.02      EMAP is now constructing major extensions of the distribution
network in the "suburbio", one of the poorest sections of Guayaquil
(see para. 3.13). The Project will supply water to this area by
reducing waste of water and increasing treatment plant and transmission
capacity. The Project will also finance the purchase and installation
of water meters for customers served by this extension and the con-
struction of distribution facilities for additional consumers in the
"suburbio", namely the "suburbio west". Additional water main extensions,
also serving the low-income population, will be built as part of the
Project once the plans for the development of Guayaquil are better
defined (see para. 4.17).
5.03      The Housing Bank and the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad
Social are building new developments for the low-income population in
the district of Eloy Alfaro (Duran), and an extension of the distri-
bution system there will be necessary in the immediate future. The
Bank loan includes funds for this extension (US$2.5 million), which
would be disbursed once the appropriate studies have been made and
approved by- the Bank.
5.0o      Demand and population forecasts will be made as a part of
the long-range water plan included in the Project and the Urban Master
Plan for Guayaquil. However, the population growth and the immediate
water demands up to 1980 have been estimated as shown in the table
below (see Annex 4). These estimates are based on existing population
growth trends and settling patterns which are unlikely to change sig-
nificantly during this short period, and are thus considered reliable.
Estimates of the population served are conservative.

ProJect Selection
5.05      The Project is the least-cost solution to satisfy the ex-
pected 1980 water demand. Feasibility studies for distribution
system extensions, which represent about 15% of project investments,
would be prepared by EMAP's consultants and submitted to the Bank
for review. The project elements were selected to achieve maximum
immediate impact in water supply service improvements for unsatis-
factorily served population, including the low-income population of
the "suburbio". Major components to satisfy future demands will be
identified and evaluated in the master plan and constructed in 1978
and thereafter.
Incremental Rate of Return on Investments
5.o6      The incremental financial rate of return on total investments
is about 12%. Because the rate of return calculation is based on the
consumers' willingness to pay only as reflected in the water tariff.
this rate does not reflect the social benefits (such as health benefits)
of providing an adequate supply of safe water to a large segment of
the urban poor at tariffs set in accordance with their ability to pay.
5.07      Specifically, the following benefits, which are only marginally
included in the revenues collected as a result of the Project, can be
mentioned:
(i)  Health benefits deriving from an increased per capita
consumption of safe, treated water piped into the
customers' premises;
(ii)  Improvements in water service.  Saf'e water at a
satisfactory pressure will be available continuously.
In low-income areas, water is now purchased from the
tank trucks at S/20/m3, but under the proposed project
it will be available on the user's premises at S/2/m3.
(iii)  Increase in the land values, as a consequence of the
installation of water supply axid sewerage services,
This increase will be most pronounced in the Santa
Elena Peninsula and in the ! suburbio" area.
5.08      If water sales would be 10% less than projected, the incre-
mental rate of return would only drop to 11%.
5.09      The Santa Elena Peninsula part of the Project will provide
benefits to a poor resident population and high-income seasonal popu-
lation. The water tariff will be designed to ensure that the seasonal
population pays the full cost of providing the high peak seasonal water
demand service (see Annex 6)~ Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the tariff for the Santa Elena Peninsula will accom-
plish this goal,

6.  THE BORROWER
6.01      The "Empresa Municipal de Agua Potable de Guayaquil" (EMAP)
will be the borrower of the proposed loan. It is an administratively
independent municipal entity, reorganized by a municipal Ordinance
of August 23, 1972, as an autonomous agency with the purpose of supplying
potable water to the city of Guayaquil and the districts (cantones) of
the Guayas province; it owns its assets, prepares its budgets, generates
its own funds (water services and bond issues) and is authorized to
receive other funds for financial assistance (assigned taxes, municipal
and government contributions and loans). The August 23, 1972 ordinance
supersedes another ordinance creating the Empresa Municipal de Agua
Potable de Guayaquil in September 1970 By Supreme Decree No. 692,
dated May 11, 1971, the National Government authorized EMAP to supply
potable water to the districts (cantones) of Salinas and Santa Elena,
both in the province of Guayas.
6.02      EMAP is governed by a Board of Directors of five members
chaired by the Mayor of Guayaquil. The other members are: the President
of the Water Affairs Committee of the Municipal Council, another member
of the municipal council, a member of the local professional association
of engineers, and a member of the "Camara de Propiedad Urbana (Charter
of TJrban Property O-nners).  The manager and internal auditor are appointed
by t-he municipal council for an indefinite period.
6.03      The Board meets weekly, and makes major decisions including
the approval of the annual budget. The Board is responsible for prep-
aration of tariffs and their submittal to the Municipality of Guayaquil.
The municipality obtains approval of these tariffs from the Junta
Nacional de Planificacion y Coordinacion Economica and the Ministry
of Finances. The deputy manager, the legal advisor, the treasurer,
and the heads of the Technical, Administrative, Financial and Operations
Departments are appointed by the Board of Directors.
6.o)L     In November 1973, the Board of Directors approved a new
organization for the Empresa which has been reviewed and found ac-
ceptable by the Bank. The Manager is responsible to the Board of
Directors for the administration of EMAP, and is assisted by a
deputy manager (subgerente) and four Department Chiefs (Finance,
Technical, Operations and Administrative), who report directly to
the Manager's office (see Chart 8370).
Staff
6.O'      The present manager of the Empresa, the former commercial
manager of Guayaquil's private electric power company (EMELEC), has
been in charge since September 1972. He is a very capable and dynamic
administrator. The position of deputy manager is now vacant because
the position has been created under the latest reorganization, but
efforts are being made to find a suitable candidate. The staff is



-19-
adequate in number and in quality, the new organization functional.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that EMAP will afford
the Bank an opportunity to comment prior to any important change in
EMAP,s organization.
6.o6      EMAP has sent several engineers to be trained overseas on
specific subjects, such as: design, operation, meter maintenance,
etc. Personnel in the finance department will require training to
administer the new accounting and computerized billing systems now
being installed (see para. 6.10). During negotiations, assurances
were obtained for the establishment of a local training program
for financial personnel. The program could be administered through
local universities assisted by PAHO and/or management consultants
(see para. 6.10).
6.07      The Empresa has a staff of 80 professional employees and
a total of 287 employees, an average of 1 employee per 1,700 persons
served. This ratio is relatively low for a utility supplying water
only, (Bogota Water and Sewerage Company serves 2,400 persons per
employee), but it is expected to improve in the course of the project
development, as the population served will nearly double without major
staff increase. Salaries paid are adequate and are considered com-
petitive for similar requirements in qualifications and responsi-
bilities in private activities, except for the position of manager.
The salary of the latter will be gradually increased to the level
paid in the private sector.
Billing, Accounting and Revenue Effectiveness Index (REI)
6o08      The billing system is good and fully computerized, and customers
are billed monthly. However, because of EMAPts backlog in installing
meters and a 3 to 4-month delay in incorporating the readings of the
newly installed meters in the billing cycle, EMAPts revenues are
negatively affected.
The Revenue Effectiveness Index (REI) 1/ shows the effect
water wastage, leaks and slow conversion of unmetered to metered
accounts have on EMAP's financial situation. A well-operated company
with 100% metering should have an REI of about 75% to 80%,

Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that:
(i) Readings of new meters should be reflected on
billing following 30 days of the installation;
(ii) A system of payments through commercial banks
should be established by December 1974 because
EMAP's own cashiers' facilities are deficient;
(iii)  The REI be increased in accordance with the
targets shown above.
6.09      The Tariff Service Regulation Ordinance provides for the
following:
(i) The Municipality of Guayaquil is exempted from
payment for the water service;
(ii) All house connections must be metered, and the sub-
scribers must pay a progressive tariff based on water
consumption and consumer categories, and a monthly
meter maintenance charge;
(iii)  New consumers must also pay a "twater right fee"
(Derecho de Abastecimiento) proportional to the
assessed value of the property, and a "house
connection fee" which includes the value of the
water meter.
6.10      The accounting system presently employed by EMAP is not
efficient nor practical, but is being replaced with a new system
recommended by PAHO, which is satisfactory to the Bank. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from EMAP that the PAHO
system will be in operation not later than December 1974, and that
consultants will be contracted not later than September 1974 to
supervise its implenentation and coordination with an efficient
use of EMAP's computer. This accounting system includes fixed
asset accounts and will replace the present unsatisfactory fixed
asset classification system.
Auditing
6.11      There is an internal auditing office reporting to the
manager, to ensure that EMAP's accounting conforms with national
laws and the Empresals regulations. This office performs its
function adequately. However, EMAP does not employ external
auditors. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
proposed borrower will engage external commercial auditors to
review EMAPts financial statements and recommend on internal
policies, procedures and controls, with 1974 being the first year
of audit, and that the auditors' reports will be sent to the Bank
within four months of the year audited.

EMAPts Merger with the Sewerage Company
6.12      Sanitary sewerage and storm water drainage for Guayaquil are
the responsibility of the municipality, through the Empresa Municipal
de Alcantarillado de Guayaquil (EMAG). A comprehensive long-range
program has been undertaken with a first stage project financed with
an IDB loan, but users are not being charged for this service.  The
Municipality of Guayaquil has proposed a merger of EMAP and EMAG.
The Bank agrees with this prospective merger (EMAP's organization
chart shows future sewerage-related activities), but assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the eventual merger of the two
companies should take place under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank.

7. FINANCES
Introduction
7.01      The large investment program (S/258 million or US$10.3 million
equivalent), started by EMAP in 1971 (see paragraph 3.13, 3.14 and Annex 1),
is being financed by supplierst credits (US$8.5 million, representing 83%
of total program cost) and EMAP's net internal cash generation (US$1.8
million). In 1970, EMAP's management foresaw that revenues from the
water services would be inadequate to cover its participation in this
program. A government decision to assign taxes and municipal contri-
butions to the company helped EMAP to cover its participation in the
financing of the investment program. As a consequence, EMAP's revenues
from water service during the period 1970-73, although increased by
70% due to revenues from 100,000 additional consumers, have been covering
its operating costs and depreciation only (and thereby producing a
negative rate of return), while earmarked taxes and contributions have
accounted for 80% of the Empresa's internal cash generation. Thus,
EMAP was able to maintain a satisfactory financial position: as of
December 31, 1973, its short-term solvency (current ratio 1.6) and long-
term solvency (long-term debt represented 26% of capitalization) were
adequate. A summary of EMAP's past finances is given below:
-__ _ _ _ S/ million---

7.02      Revenues from earmarked taxes are pledged as guarantees of
EMAPts supplierst credits. Therefore, they will be maintained during
the execution of the Project. However, provisions have been made to
increase EMAP's revenues from water (see para. 7.05) so that these
taxes can be progressively phased out from the Empresa's total income
and used to finance social projects such as rural water supply pro-
grams, housing, etc. for the low-income population. After 1980,
EMAP will obtain all its revenues from the sale of water and will
no longer require earmarked taxes. At that time, the consumer will
pay for the service he receives without the help of grants or sub-
sidies, a principle EMAP accepts and plans to implement. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that EMAP will grant the Bank a
lien on earmarked taxes and other revenues, equal to those granted
to EMAP suppliers.



-23-
Tariffs
7.03      Present water tariffs in Guayaquil were approved in June 1972
and implemented in 1973. The tariff structure is progressive and based
on consumption. The minimum charge of S/28 per month buys 20 m3, and is
the same for all categories (residential, commercial and industrial).
The charge for consumption over the minimum varies from S/1.60/m3
(lowest residential excess consumption) to S/5060/m3 (highest industrial
excess consumption). This tariff structure is reasonable, although a
reduction of the 20 m3 minimum consumption allowance should be considered
at the time of the next tariff increase, and is shown in Annex ll0
Municipal bodies receive water free, although their consumption is
metered.
7.04      The average revenue per cubic meter of water sold is S/1.77.
The average price for metered water at the time of appraisal was S/3.80
per m3, the average price for nonmetered water (based on estimated con-
sumption) was S/0.70 per m30 At that time, about half of 40,000 con-
nections serving 450,000 inhabitants were metered. The average price
for metered water is among the highest in Latin America and will decrease
as service is extended to lower income groups (connections will double,
metered connections quadruple by 1980), but will remain very high.
7.05      Charges for installation and connection are reviewed by EMAP
every six months and are established according to assessed property
value, diameter of connection, and classification as commercial, resi-
dential or industrial. Connection charges are paid over a period of
six months.  The massive meter installation in the "suburbio" would be
more successful if the payment period for connection charges were in-
creased to at least five years. EMAP plans to incorporate such an
extended payment plan in its tariff. All metered consumers pay from
S/5 for a ;1t meter to S/300 per month for a 6" meter as the maintenance
charge for the meters, according to size.
7.06      Present tariff levels would be sufficient to cover EMAP's
financial needs in 1974 and 1975, based on a reasonable annual increase
of 1.4% in per capita consumption, the conversion of existing non-
metered to metered connections, and the installation of about 20,000
new metered connections, which would allow the Empresa to reduce its
unaccounted-for water from 47% in 1973 to 31% in 1975. However,
tariffs should be raised in 1976 to increase EMAP's revenues by 15%
to provide the Empresa with the additional funds niecessary to main-
tain its participation in the program of works.  Subsequently, an
annual tariff adjustment of 5% will be necessary topartially compensate
for inflation.



-24-
7.07      EMAP will design a differential tariff structure for the
seasonal and permanent population of the Santa Elena Peninsula
(see para. 5.09 and Annex 6). For financial projection purposes,
it has been assumed that all connections in the peninsula will be
metered, that the permanent population will have an average con-
sumption of 20 m3/month at S/6 per m3, and that the seasonal
tourist population will have an average consumption of 50 m3/month
during the tourist season (10 m3/montb during the rest of the year)
at S/24 per m3. During the season (January-April), the permanent
and seasonal tourist population would consume 56% and 44% of total
water sold, respectively.
Financing Plan
7.08      The financial plan for the period 1974-77 is summarized
below. Annex 7 describes the financial assumptions used in the
financial projections.

-25-
7.09      The plan is based upon:
(i) IBRD financing of S/580 million (US$23.2 million). The
Bank loan is assumed to have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding four years of grace, and to carry interest
at 7  and a commitment fee of 3/4 of one percent;
(ii)  suppliers' credits of S/67 million (US$2.7 million)
for the financing of EMAPts ongoing projects, repre-
senting 6% of total investment for the period under
consideration. These credits bear an interest rate
of 8% and will be amortized in five years beginning
1975 (see para. 3.14);
(iii)  Government contribution of S/195 million (US$7.8 million)
for the financing of 50% of the Santa Elena part of
the Project; and
(iv) EMAP's net internal resources for S/313 million
(US$12.5 million), for financing 27% of the investment.
If costs are greater than estimated, the Borrower would be
expected to meet overruns, but assurances were obtained during
negotiations from the Ecuadorian Government that it will promptly pro-
vide the necessary funds if the Borrower cannot do so, and to make
available the contribution foreseen in the financing plan.
Future Finances
7.10      EMAP's forecast income statements are summarized below.
Detailed forecast financial statements are in Annex 8.

Rate of Return 1/               2.0       6.0  /       6.0        8.0
EMAP's financial performance would continue to be satis-
factory after the completion of the Project in 1977, providing the
necessary annual tariff increases are made. Assurances were
obtained from EMAP during negotiations that EMAP will adjust tariffs
to produce revenues from the sale of water sufficient to provide
the company with the annual financial rates of return given below:
1/ On revalued fixed assets; see Annex 12.
2/ Based on a 15% tariff increase.



-26-
1974/75      1976 to 1979       1980 and Thereafter
2.0             6.0                   8.0
After project completion in 1977, EMAP would generate suf-
ficient income to finance around 40% of the construction investment
required up to the year 1985.
Financial Rate of Return
7.11      The financial rate of return was calculated on the net
revalued assets tentatively estimated by the mission. The rate of
return should improve during the Project from -0.8% in 1973 to 8.0%
by 1980.
The main reasons for this improvement are:
(i)  the increase of subscribers at a rate of 14.2% per
annum;
(ii) the change of 23,000 unmetered to metered connections
by the end of 1974;
(iii)  a 15% increase in water rates, effective January 1976;
(iv) decrease of unaccounted-for water from its high present
level of 47% to 20% in 1980.
7.12      The system of revaluation and depreciation of assets is detailed
in Annex 12. The existing system is deficient and assurances were obtained
during negotiations that a method of revaluation and depreciation satis-
factory to the Bank be established by December 31, 1974.
Debt Service Coverage Ratio
7.13      This ratio has been satisfactory during 1972 and 1973 (2.5
and 2.0). The projected values up to 1980 would have a maximum of
3.0 by 1980 and a minimum of 1.6 in 1975, which are also acceptable
figures.  However, in order to prevent the Empresa to undertake uneco-
nomical investments, or to assure existing loans (such as IDB loan
if EMAG would be absorbed by EMAP; see para. 6.12) without sufficient
guarantee of repayment, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that EMAP will not incur long-term debts without the Bank's consent
unless net income before interest and depreciation is at least 1.5,
the maximum debt service in any future year.

cycle will be improved, payment of bills by customers
will be facilitated, and improvements of the REI will
be achieved in accordance with the following targets:
Year        1973        1976      1978       1980
REI (%)      33          66         75        76

place under conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 6.12);
(xi)  EMAP will grant the Bank a lien on earmarked
taxes and other income equal to those granted
to EMAP suppliers (para. 7.02);
(xii) Water tariffs will be reviewed annually and
adjusted, if necessary, to produce revenues
from the sale of water sufficient to achieve
rates of return not less than the following:
1.980 and
Year          197j/75   1976 to 1979  Thereafter
Rate of return  2.0           6.0         8.0
(para. 7.10)
(xiii)  Fixed assets on which a rate of return is required
will be revalued annually, in a manner acceptable
to the Bank (para. 7.12);
(Xiv)  A debt service coverage ratio of not less than 15
will be maintained (para. 7013);
b)  From the Ecuadorian Government:
(i)  that it will make available the contribution foreseen
in the financing plan (para. 7.09);
(ii)  that it will promptly provide the necessary funds
to complete the Project (if the Borrower cannot
do so), if costs are greater than estimated (para. 7.09).
8.02      With assurances indicated above, the Project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$23.2 million for a term of 25 years,
including a four-year grace period.

ECUADOR
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT FOR GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE
EMPRESA MUNICIPAL DE AGUA POTABLE DE GUAYAQUIL
THE PROJECT
I. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY FACILITIES
Area Served
1.        The city of Guayaquil is located on the coast of Ecuador and lies
in a low marshy plain the west bank of the Guayas River, at 20111 south
latitude and 79053' west of the Greenwich meridian. It is the capital of
the Guayas Province and with a population of 1,000,000 people, is the largest
city in the country.  It is in a tropical area with temperatures varying
from 220 to 330 centigrades with two main seasons: rainy warmer season
(January through May) called "winter", and a dry season called "summer"',
with lower temperatures and scarce precipitation, from June to December.
2.        The population in Guayaquil presently served with water supply
is estimated at 475,000 inhabitants.  West of the city, a large concen-
tration of 400,000 low-income squatters live in a flood-prone area called
the "Suburbio" without basic sanitation facilities. These people get water
from tank-trucks and 30 public fountains, obviously of low quality and
insufficient in quantity.
3.        On the east side of the Guayas River, EMAP provides water supply
service to 62,000 so-called "rural" population in the towns of Duran (Eloy
Alfaro), Yaguachi, Ingenio San Carlos, Milagro and Naranjito.  These towns
have an estimated total population of 128,000 inhabitants.
4.        In 1970 the Empresa was given the responsibility of supplying
water to the entire Guayas Province, including rural and urban population.
The Santa Elena Peninsula, which is formed by the Guayaquil, Salinas and
Santa Elena districts (cantones) is under the jurisdiction of EKAP. The
peninsula has a permanent population of about 76,000 inhabitants (estimated
at the end of 1973) and a seasonal populatian attracted by its beaches to
reside in the main towns of Playas (General Villamil), Santa Elena,
La Libertad, Ballenita and Salinas. These visitors are mainly the 3% of
the higher income population of the city of Guayaquil -nd will amount to
an estimated 24,000 persons during the warm season of 1974 (January through
April).



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 11 pages
5.        Outside of 80 house connections in La Libertad wlich receive
an average of 17 m3/month fram a small surface water source, there is no
public water supply in the peninsula. Water is obtained from shallow
unprotected wells and sold to the users through water tank-trucks
(tanqueros), at a cost of $.15 to 0.60 per cubic meter.
Sources of Water
6.        There are two main water sources for the city of Guayaquil and
the rural area:
(a)  The Daule River, a tributary of the Guayas Riverp
with a maximum recorded flow of 1806 m3/sec on
March 7, 1972, and a minimum dry weather flow of
13.3 m3/sec, said to be the lowest in 50 years, a
yield well above the expected supply requiremret.,s
of Guayaquil through the end of the century; this
water is biologically, physically and chemically
suitable for treatment and subsequent human
consumption;
(b)  The rural area is supplied with water originating
on the western slope of the Andean Mountai_ns in a zone
called Bacay, from five impounded streams yielding a
minimum of 0.4 m3/sec., sufficient to serve the towns
mentioned up to 1985. Other future water sources have been
preliminarily selected such as the Milagro aquifer,
Chacuayacu and Padul rivers and Santa Lucia streams.
Water Treatment
7.        Raw water for Guayaquil is pumped from an intake on the Daule
River to La Toma treatment plant, by 7 diesel engines driven pumping
units with a maximum rate of 220,000 m3/day, through two force mains, one
of 42"* 4 (prestressed concrete) and the otheS 50" $ (ste.el) with a length
of 1,700 meters, and a capacity of 320,000 m /day at a TDH of 90 meters.
A third 16" 4 pipeline is kept as a standby force main.
8.        Water treatment is provided in two plants.  One of them, La Tomaa,
23 kms. north of Guayaquil, has a capacity of 200,000 m3/day, but production
has been increased to a sustained yield of 220,000 m3/day without affecting
the quality of the finished water. The plant has two different systems;
the first one built in 1950 is conventional, with chemical coagulation,
sedimentation and rapid sand filters and a capacity of 120,000 to 140,000
m3/day; the other built in 1971, consists of a so id contact reactor and
rapid sand filters, with a production of 80,000 m'/day.  Both systems have
pH correction with lime, chlorine disinfection, and produce water with a
quality that is satisfactory and ccmnplies with WHO Standards for Public
Water Supply.



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 11 pages
9.        The other, the Lolita treatment plant, located 54 kms. east of
Guayaquil, has an installed capacity of 36,000 m3/day, and was used to
supply water to Guayaquil up to 1972. The water entered the city through
4 underwater pipes across Guayas River, which were difficult to maintain
and are now damaged and out of service. This plant, built in the beginning
of the century, purifies water by plain sedimentation and slow sand fil-
tration, followed by disinfection with chlorine.
10.       The Lolita plant production is presently consumed in coamunities
on the left side of the Guayas River, such as Naranjito, Ingenio San Carlos,
Milagro, Yaguachi and Duran (Eloy Alfaro), served by two 55 kilometers long
transmission lines of 11" and 22" diameter.  An estimated 79% of the 32,000
m3/day presently produced is unaccounted for. There are 6,070 registered
house connectimis of which only 1,320 have water meters in these towns and
an additional estimated 1,000 clandestine connections along the transmission
lines and in the city of Milagro.
Water Transmission
11.       Two transmission mains, a 421" diameter pretensioned steel cylinder
concrete pipes and a 50" diameter steel pipe, both with cathodic protection,
and with a length of 21,500 meters, provide a carrying capacity of 220,000
m3/day from the La Tora treatment plant to the West Reservoir.  Both
lines are in good condition, but the concrete pipe has been tapped at the
air and drainage valves in 19 places to serve new residential and industrial
developments at a rate of 18,000 m3/day. It is recommended that the use of
the 4211 pipe to feed these new and future developments, be regulated.
Water Distribution
12.       The distribution network consists of 1,200 km of pipe ranging from
42" to 3" in diameter over an area of 30 square kilometers.  In downtown
Guayaquil, the distribution pipes (some 50 years old) are in poor condition
and corroded; a high percentage of breakage is registered, and water losses
due to leaking pipes are also high. A similar situation exists in Urdesa
Urbanization due to the corrosion of unprotected cast iron and galvanized
iron pipe.
13.       Reservoir capacity in Guayaquil is provided through seven water
tanks with a volume of 94,000 m3, which amounts to 48% of the average 1973
daily production, including the presently high estimated losses and wastages
in the system. This reservoir capacity is satisfactory.
14.       There is an independent raw water fire protection distribution
network in an area of 400 hectares in the older part of the city of Guayaquil,
with a water intake on the Guayas River, pumping station and storage tanks
located on El Carmen hill, northeast of the city.



ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 11 pages
15.       Service pressure in the distribution system is low; the closest
point to the Santa Ana Reservoir, the beginning of the Salado waterfront
network has cnly 20 lbs/sq. in. of pressure during the day, downtown
Guayaquil, 10 lbs/sq. in. and the farthest part, the Unidad Vecinal Sur,
a social security fund development, 6 km. to the south, only 6 lbs/sq. in.
The high leakage rate in the network seems to be the main cause of this
situation.
16.       The Empresa conducts bacteriological analyses of the water dis-
tributed, through 10 to 12 daily samples. Tests are made for MPN Coli and
Total Bacteria counts and residual chlorine. Due to the condition of the
distribution network and the lack of pressure, some contamination of the
water has been observed in the third quarter of 1973.
17.       There were 41,500 house connections in Guayaquil by the end of
1973, of which only 29,000 have water meters.  This is one of the main
causes for high unaccounted-for water and wastage, since unmetered consumers
are charged the tariff corresponding to the minimum consumption, encouraging
the waste of water. An EMAP program, now underway, has the target of metering
all connections by the end of 1974.
Present Water Consumption
18.       Present consumption in Guayaquil and the "rural" area was assessed
on the basis of information collected from EMAP's billing offices and a
survey of the first one to three months'consumption in houses where unmetered
house connections were changed to metered ones. A major factor in the high
number of persons served per connection, is that apartment buildings and
houses have only one house connectian per building. For Guayaquil, the
following figures were obtained in 1973:
Category                    Consumption            Production
Thousand m3/day    lpcd    Thousand m3/day
Residential                         100            210
Industrial and Commercial            25
Total                               125                        196
A consumption of 305 lpcd was assumed in the residential non-metered
connections, likely to be reduced when meters are installed. As a result,
the per capita water production in 1973 has been calculated in 411 lped,
with 36% of water produced as losses in the system, and around 47% total
unaccounted-for water.

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Problem
1.        The EMAP's jurisdiction covers the Guayas Province. With
regard to present and future water services, the area may be divided into
three parts: (a) towns located at the left bank of the Guayas River:
Eloy Alfaro (Duran), Milagro, Yaguachi, Ingenio San Carlos and Naranjito;
(b) the city of Guayaquil and the town of Daule, on the right bank of the
Guayas River; (c) towns located on the Santa Elena Peninsula, including
Playas, Salinas, La Libertad, Ballenita and Santa Elena, and a number
of small villages (Porsorja, Progreso, San Antonio, Cerecita, Changon).
2.        These areas all are poorly served with water, the pressure is
low and the losses from leakage and wastage are excessive. The population
is growing more than 5% per year and to meet these needs a long-range
water suply program is required. Several constraints force us to divide
the long-range program in two stages: immediate needs up to 1977, and a
second project or Master Plan up to year 2000. These characteristics are:



ANNEX 1
Page 7 of 11 pages
(a) lack of an urban development master plan for the city
of Guayaquil as well as for the region that includes
the districts (cantones) of Guayaquil, Milagro,
Naranjito, Yaguachi, Daule, Santa Elena and Salinas.
(b) the urgent needs of the squatter population of the
"Suburbio" in the western section of Guayaquil, settled
on low, often flooded land that has been costly and
painfully partially earth-filled; the "Suburbio"
population amounts to 400,000 inhabitants around 40%
of the total in the city;
(c) a comprehensive feasibility study of water supply for
the city of Guayaquil and the Guayas Province is not
available; instead, individual designs for additions
and improvements of the raw water pumping stations,
La Toma water treatment plant and the transmission
mains, for extensions of the distribution system for
Daule and the Santa Elena Peninsula water supply were
made available to the mission.
Nevertheless, a project, to satisfy the immediate needs, has been defined
and cost estimates brought up to date with the participation of EMAP's
consulting engineers and technical staff. Final designs of the project
are being prepared now by the technical department of the Eupresa, with
the assistance of their consulting engineers, and should be sent to the
Bank for review prior to the completion of negotiations.
Description of the Project
Water Intake, Pumping Station and Force Mains
3.        The Empresa is adding 120,000 m3/day pumping capacity to the
raw water intake system located 24 km. north of the city of Guayaquil
and by the time the project is started, the new pumps should be installed.
This will bring the total capacity to 320,000 m3/day which appears to be
sufficient until 1980, when water demand will exceed this capacity. The
project also includes interconnection of the force mains of 42" and 50"
diameter with a 16" diameter standby line to bring the total carrying
capacity of the force mains system to 320,000 m3/day with a TDH (Total
Dynamic Head) of 90 meters.
La Toma Water Treatment Plant
4.        The La Toma water treatment plant is now being improved to double
the coagulation and settling yield of the old sedimentation units to produce
up to 320,000 m3/day of settled water, but the rapid sand filters do not
have the ability to treat this water. The project proposes to increase
the filtration rate of the first plant 80 to 16Q lts/min/m2 by changing
the sand filtration media to dual sand-anthracite media, and adapting the
rate-of-flow controllers and operating tables to this increased capacity,
and thus raise the overall plant output to 320,000 m3/day.



ANNEX 1
Page 8 of 11 pages
Transmission Main Capacity Increase
5.        The present 21,500 m. long tpansmissian mains of 422" and 50"
diameter, have a capacity of 213,000 m'/day, at a loss of head of 1.08 mts.
per 1,000 mts. Additional capacity will be required by 1976, and the
project provides for th$ construction of a 72" i transmission main with
a capacity of 345,500 m'/day.  The combined capacity of these mains will
be adequate for the ultimate capacity of the La Toma treatment plant.
This new 72" F transmission main will be 15,000 m long, interconnected
with the other 412" and 50" diameter mains. Another 7,500 meter section
of the 72" # main should be installed during the second stage of the
long-range program between 1977 and 1980.
Extensions and Improvements of the Distribution Network
6.        EMAP engineers in charge of the operation of the distribution
system have expressed their concern for the frequent pipe breakages in
downtown Guayaquil, Urdesa and other residential areas; sample exavations
show that old, unprotected steel and cast iron pipes are corroded and need
to be replaced. A high percentage of losses and unaccounted-for water is
caused by leaky pipes in these areas.
7.        Nearly 60% of the population of Guayaquil has a low income (less
than 2,000 Sucres month/family) and most of them live without basic sanitation
services in the "Suburbio". The municipality has been trying to organize
this squatter population by land upgrading and laying out blocks and streets
in a flood-exposed area of about 1,200 hectares west of Guayaquil, a very
costly and time-consmning work; this area does not have basic sanitation
services and some of its inhabitants have to be relocated in places not yet
well-defined. A water distribution network is now under construction for
the main upgraded part of this "Suburbio" sections but not the #Suburbio" west.
8.        To improve this situation, the project includes the
following distribution system works:
(i) The replacement of parts of the distribution network
in downtown Guayaquil, Urdesa and other residential
areas, of the corroded and broken pipes detected as
determined by the hydrometric and leaks-detection
study now being carried out by EMAP and its consulting
engineers;
(ii) Distribution network expansion for the less developed
and poorer sections of the city of Guayaquil, and
low-income population housing development program

areas such as Eloy Alfaro (Duran), Mapasingue, Santa Ana,
San Pedro, "Suburbiohl west, and some other municipal
urbanizations resulting from the relocation of low-inceme
dwellers from nonconsolidated areas, according to studies
being carried out now and during the project's execution.
Water Supply Service for the City of Daule
9.        The city of Daule, in the district of the same name, is located
34 kn. north of Guayaquil amid a rich and productive agriculture and cattle
zone; it has a population of 12,000 inhabitants distributed over an area
of 110 hectares. Presently a small part of the people of Daule get low-
quality water with a high chloride cmtent from wells, through a provisinal
distributim network and an elevated tank; nevertheless, the objectionable
taste of this water cmpels many people to buy water produced in the La Toma
treatment plant and transported by water-tank trucks (tanqueros).
10.       A new water supply for the city of Daule has been considered in
the project to serve an estimated population of 25,000 inhabitants by the
year 1990, for an average water consumption of 43 lts/sec (5,750 m3/day),
representing 230 liters per capita per day, and an hourly peak of 78 lts/sec.
Water will be conducted from La Toma water treatment plant by a 17 kmi, 12" d
pipeline.
Water Supply System for the Santa Elena Peninsula
11.       According to a National Government Supreme Decree dated May 14,
1971, EMAP was given the responsibility of supplying water services to the
main to-wns located in the districts (cantones) of Guayaquil, Salinas and
Santa Elena, in the Santa Elena Peninsula, one of the most beautiful
sumer resorts in Ecuador.
12.       It has been estimated that by 1977, at the end of the project4s
first stage, 67,000 persons in Playas (General Villamil), La Libertad,
Ballenita, Santa Eleaa, Salinas and the villages of Progreso, Posorja,
San Antonio, Chongon, and Cerecita will be benefitting from a water supply
service, including the seasonal populaticn (January through April), when
an estimated 2% of the Guayaquil higher-income population move to the
beaches as residents.
13.       Estimates made by EKAP and local municipalities indicate that
at the end of 1973, the total permanent population was around 76,000
inhabitants, including the small villages mentioned, and that the expected
seasonal addition or transient population would be near 22,000 persons.
In this figure beach visitors are not included during the weekends which
may amount to 60,000 persons in one day.



ANNEX 1
Page 10 of 11 pages
14.       Assuming that conveying water from Guayaquil to the town in
the Santa Elena Peninsula is the least-cost solution (seawater desali-
nation and groundwater abstraction are under study), the Project con-
templates supplying the water needs of the permanent and tourist
population at the peak seasonal demand (January-April) up to year 1990
for an estimated 170,000 inhabitants.
15.       Twenty-five thousand m3/day of water would be conveyed from
the West Reservoir in Guayaquil to Santa Elena Reservoir in Santa
Elena, through a 24" diameter transmission main (58.4 km - first
section) and a 20" diameter pipe (64.0 km - second section); at the
end of the first section in Las Monas Reservoir, a branch line 16"
diameter 30 km long would carry the water to the beach town of
Playas (General Villamil). The water for Salinas, La Libertad,
Ballenita and Santa Elena would be distributed from the Santa Elena
Reservoir. The city of Salinas is farthest from the reservoir,
15.3 km away, and represents the maximum transmission main length
of 138 km from Guayaquil to Salinas. Two pumping stations with a
total head of 100 meters each have been included in the first
section of the transmission main.
Installation of Water Meters in the "Suburbio West"
16.       A water distribution network is actually under construction
in the upgraded part of the "Suburbio" west. This network includes
domestic water connections for about 30,000 low-income families.
Water meters were not included in the construction contract.
17.       According to legal requirements, all house connections must
be provided with water meters. Water wastage in unmetered connections
of dwellers of similar socioeconomic conditions is very high, according
to field observations made by EMAP's distribution system operation
engineers, and the high consumption of previously nonmetered consumers
registered in the first month after meter installation.
18.       The purchase and installation of 30,000 water meters for the
prospective consumers of the "Suburbion west has been included in the
Project; this program should be initiated by the end of 1974, and
completed throughout the development of the Project, and should be
carried out with the participation of specialists to educate the
population in this poor section of the city on the benefits of water
use.
Feasibility Study and Water SUpply Master Plan for Year 2000
19.       Long-range planning programs to provide an adequate water
supply for the fast-growing city of Guayaquil are required. It has
not been possible for EMAP, until now, to prepare such a future-looking



ANNEX 1
Page 11 of 11 pages
scheme, due to the lack of a sound urban development master plan and the
need to examine on a broad basis, and with regional criteria, the future
water supply requirements of the other towns and villages located in the
Guayas Province.
20.       Guayaquil has been growing at 5.6% per annum during the last
decade half of which is due to immigration. This rapid growth highlights
the urgent need to plan for commercial, industrial and residential areas,
transportation services, markets, public utilities, and recreation areas.
An evaluation of such projects from a socioeconomic viewpoint should be
a major concern of the UNDP Urban Study. This will in turn affect EMAP's
plans for future water supply services.
21.       Considering that urban development planning is a municipal
responsibility and that the UNDP is assisting the Municipality in this
endeavor, the following activities have been included in the project:
(i) A feasibility study and long-range water supply
master plan for Guayaquil and towns under EMAP's
jurisdiction, with the eventual development of a
sewerage master plan if merger with the sewerage
company should take place. The study should be
coordinated with the municipality's urban
development study;
(ii) Study of the costs and benefits of upgrading
squatter areas, (including expansion of existing
areas), especially in the "Suburbio"2, Mapasingue,
El Guasmo, and other similar low-income areas;
(iii) Feasibility studies for the extension of the water
distribution network and sewer system (if merger
takes place), to areas suitable for urbanization;
funds have been included in the project for
construction of distribution systems of these new
urban developments into which low-income population
is relocated. The disbursement of this part of the
Bank loan will be contingent upon the completion of
these studies and their subsequent approval by the
Bank; and
(iv) A socioeconomic study to establish capacity to pay
for housing, public utilities, transportation, and
determine land tenure in low-income areas.

RATE OF RETURN
PROJECT RATE OF RETURN
The Overall Project (Guayaquil and rural areas and peninsula projects)
1.        The incremental rate of return of the Project has been
calculated as the discount rate equalizing the stream of benefits
(incremental water revenues) and costs (capital and operating cost)
over the life of the Project (40 years).
(In 1974 prices)

The incremental rate of return is about 12%o With water sales 10% less
than projected, the rate of return would only drop to 11%.
The Santa Elena Peninsula Project
2.        The Project fulfills a social objective in supplying water to
the permanent population amounting to some 76,000 people, who now only
consume very limited quantities of unsafe water. Bringing water to the
peninsula will undoubtedly give a great impetus to its tourism industry
and thereby to the economic development of the area. A groundwater study
and an evaluation of water desalination costs are now being undertaken
by EMAP consultants to verify that the proposed project is the least-
cost solution to supply the projected demand. Demand has been projected
considering the restraining effect on consumption of the high cost of
water.
1/ The incremental revenues include increased collection of revenues
as a result of the installation of meters (financed through the
proposed loan) and other measures to improve collection efficiently.
Tariffs will not be increased in real terms up to 1980 and the incre-
mental revenues do therefore not include additional revenues from
consumption not attributable to the Project.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2 pages
3.        The income distribution effects of the Project need to be
carefully examined. The seasonal residents benefitting from the Project
are within the highest 5% income bracket in Ecuador. However, by using
a differential tariff for seasonal and permanent consumers, a direct
subsidy to this high income group will be avoided, although they will
still be the main beneficiaries of the land value increase that takes
place as a result of the Project. Some of these land-plus values
could benefit the public sector through the reassessment of land value
and an increase of the special betterment tax. The Bank should recommend
to the Ecuadorian Government that such measures be taken. Part of the
proceeds from this tax will be needed to finance infrastructure, such
as swerage, in the peninsula.
4.        The incremental rate of return of the Santa Elena part of the
Project is around 10%. An estimate of the proceeds from the betterment
tax has been included in the benefits as a minimum expression of land
value increases and of consumer willingness to pay for the Project above
the revenues to be collected through water sales. With 10% lower water
sales than projected, the Santa Elena part of the Project would earn a
rate of return of 9%.

EMPRESA MUNICIPAL DE AGUA POTABLE DE GUAYAQUIL
WATER PRICING CONSIDERATICNS
GuayacUil
1.        The tariff policy adopted by EMAP is to subsidize low-income
consumers by charging higher prices to high-income consumers with high
per capita consumption. EMAP should continue to charge for water
according to a progressive tariff structure. Special credit facilities
should be made available to the low-income population in specific areas
to finance the cost of house connections over a period of 5-8 years,
with an interest rate (in US dollar equivalents) not exceeding the
interest rate of the Bank loan. The monthly meter charge to the low-
income population should cover only the capital and operating cost of
maintaining such meters.
2.        Considering that the low-income population of Guayaquil will
face a series of additional expenditures for basic infrastructure such
as water, sewerage, landfill, etc., a study is required (see para. 4.16)
which should:
(i) establish the capacity to pay of the low-income popu-
lation and define the areas where special concessions
should be granted for payment of public services;
(ii) establish land tenure in squatter areas to determine
beneficiaries of infrastructure investments; and
(iii) recommend design of infrastructure projects and pricing
policies compatible with the capacity to pay.
Santa Elena Peninsula
3.        When determining the water price and the tariff structure for
the Santa Elena Peninsula, the following points should be considered:
(i) the high cost of supplying water to the peninsula;
(ii) the existence of two distinctive groups of consumers,
high-income seasonal residents and permanent low-income
residents.
4.        The high cost of the water resulting from the investment
required to build a long transmission main makes it difficult to set
tariffs to make thti project financially viable, although the seasonal
population has a high payment capacity and has in the past demonstrated
a willingness to pay high prices for limited quantities of water. A
subsidy to the permanent population could, however, be justified on
income distribution grounds.



a-NEX 6
Page 2 of 2 pages
5,        EMAP should design a differential tariff s-tructuue for the
seasonal and permanent population of the peninsula. To distinguish
between these two groups, the classification used by the electrical
company or any other classification acceptable by the Bank, devised
by EMAP, may be used.
6.        The average per connection charge to the seasonal population
should reflect the unsubsidized cost of watero The average per con-
nection charge to the permanent population should reflecet their capacity
to pay,
7.        The unsubsidized price for water is defined as the price
which produces at least an internal rate of return on the part of the
Project corresponding to the seasonal population of at least 10,%
The permanent population's capacity to pay has been estimated to a
maximum of S/140 per connection and month in 1973.
B.        When calculating the tariff, the fixed capacity cost of
the Project has been allocated between the seasonal and permanent
population on the basis of their respective use of the peak volume
produced during the year of full utilization of the installed capacity
(in 1980, 44% seasonal population, 56% permanent population). On this
basis, the average monthly connection charge for the seasonal population
will be S/785, and for the permanent population, S/230, in 1980.
9.        The demand projections take into account that water consumption
in the peninsula will be restrained because of the high cost of water.
However, not to unduly restrain consumption (for instance, below the
minimum required for hygienic reasons), the tariff structuire should be
designed to charge a major portion of the cost as a fixed consumption
charge. This pricing policy is justified on economic ,rounds because
the marginal cost of supplying water to the peninsula (the operating
costs and the incremental capacity cost) is lower than the average
cost. This is so because the fixed investment necessary to suapply
even a minimum quantity of water to the peninsula represents a large
share of the cost of the project proposed for financing. The fixed
monthly charge should (for both seasonal and permanent conswners) be
set to correspond to the fixed capacity cost of the system, whereas
the m3 charge should reflect the operating cost and the incremental
capacity cost. The fixed consumption charge should be progressively
related to the assessed property values, the variable charge to the
volume of water consumed0
10,       In order to discriminate between seasonal and permanent
consumers for the purpose of charging a differential tariff, the
classification of seasonal and permanent consumers used by the
electrical company could be used. In addition, it is suggested that
the variable charge be increased in the peak season.

EMPRE5A MUNICIPAL DE AGUA POTABLE DE GUAYAQUIL
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PRO JECTIONS
1. Introduction
All financial projections have been made by computer. Because
no comprehensive feasibility study for the Project was available,
the projections are particularly detailed.
2. Sucre Devaluation and Inflation in Ecuador
No devaluation of the Ecuadorian currency (1 US$=S/.25) has been
made for the years of Project construction. Subsequently to Project
completion, a devaluation of 20% has been assumed, although the Ecuadorian
balance of payment should improve in the future with oil exports.
An internal inflation of 10% a year has been assumed. This figure
was obtained by regressive analysis of the Ecuadorian cost of living made
on the basis of reliable statistics provided by the University of Guayaquil.
3. EMAP's Revenues
EMAP's revenues from water sales and connected charges have been
projected for each of the three areas where water services are provided,
that is the city of Guayaquil, the rural towns and the Santa Elena Penin-
sula. The following assumptions have been made in the financial projections:
(a) per capital demand increases 1% a year;
(b)  average water tariff per m3 increases 1.4% a year to reflect
the increase in per capita consumption;
(c) average water tariff per m3 increases by 15% in 1976 and 5%
a year thereafter to reflect internal inflation;
(d) all connections will be progressively metered;
(e) consumption and revenues are as follows:
Guayaquil: - Monthly revenues from unmetered connections: S/80 (Residential)
- Monthly consumption and revenues from metered connections
(residential): 61m3 and S/125
- Monthly consumption and revenues from metered connections:
Commercial : 194 m3 and S/630
Industrial : 650 m3 and S/3,173
Official   : 425 m3 and s/464



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 6 pages
-Commercial and industrial number of connections increase
18% a year and the proportion between these connections
remains at 1 industrial for 3 commercial
-Water sold to water trunks: 77 m,3 a month or S/460
-Water sold to the port authority: 2,700 m3 a month or
S/150,000 increasing 5% a year
-Water losses are assumed to decrease from 47% of total
production in 1974 to 24% in 1980
-Each individual meter is assumed to have a cost of S/343
and to be sold at 5/629
-Each new metered connection is assumed to have a cost of
S/485 and to be invoiced at S/993
-Connection fees vary from S/300 to S/1,200 (suburban and
non-suburban)
-Meter maintenance is assumed to provide EMAP with S/6
a month per meter
Rural Towns (Milagros, Naranjito, Eloy Alfaro, Yaguachi, and Bucay):
-Consumption by unmetered connection 50 m3/month (18%
below Guayaquil). An annual increase of 1% is assumed.
Average monthly billing: S/26.
-10% of connections presently metered, 4,750 new meters
will be installed between 1974 and 1978
-The number of new connections is assumed to bq 158/semester
-Commercial and industrial connections: 433 m- /month or
S/198
-Losses would decrease from 42% of total production in 1974
to 28% in 1978
-Other revenues: same as in Guayaquil
Santa Elena Peninsula (Salinas, Playas, Santa Elena, La Libertad, Ballenitas,
and some small villages):
For the permanent low-income population:
-Average water consumption of 20m3/month and 95 liters
per peso per day, with all house connections metered,
increasing 2% per year, starting 1976.
-Unit price of water assumed is Sucres S/6.02 per cubic
meter for an average monthly water bill of S/120 in 1973;
presently they pay about 3/195 per month for 5-6 m3 of water
per month.
-Water consumption in the season (January-April) would be
56% of total.
-Water sold to water tank trucks would be 246,000 m3/year,
increasing at a rate of 1% per year, for dispersed rural
population.
-8% per year increase in the earnings per meter for tariff
increase and more water consumption.
For the seasonal tourist population:
(A consumer would be classified as non-permanent or tourist, if
his water consumption during off-season (May-December) is lower



ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 6 pages
than 50% of his average monthly seasonal consumption, and
if water services are regularly used for 8 months/year or
less).
- Average water consumption of 50 m3/month during 4-5 months
(season January-Ap5il). The rest of the year a 20% consumption
equivalent of 10 m /month is assumed. Consumption would
increase 2% per year.
- Unit price of water assumed is S/24.00 per cubic meter, with
an average yearly water bill of S/5,570 (or S/464 per month)
at 1973 prices. Presently they pay S/6,0o0 per year (4 months
consumption) for 200 m3 of water.
- Water consumption during season would be 44% of total.  Penin-
sula consumption, and house connections represent 27% of the
total. Water pricing is based upon payment of full cost of
providing water services in this peak seasonal demand.
- 8% per year increase in the earnings from water sales for
tariff increase and added water consumption.
- A fixed charge or minimum payment of S/200/month throughout
the year.
4.  EMAP's Operating Costs
Production's Salaries
EMAP's Financial Department assumes an average yearly increase of
8% due to the following reasons:
(i)  A salary increase of 10% for workers, according to the increase
in the cost of living;
(ii)  Salary increase of 5% to technical and administrative
personnel; and
(iii) No major increase in personnel.
An average increase of 10% is assumed due to the small number
of technical personnel and because the expansion to Sta. Elena require
few additional personnel.
Production Expenses
The amount of electricity, cholorine, other chemicals, etc. is
proportional to the water produced. The production expenses for 1970,
1971, 972 and the first six months of 1973 were 0.08, 0.105, 0.14 and
0.17 m . These production expenses include a fixed cost of 3/700,000
for maintenance of vehicles and S/200,000 for laboratory supplies.
A more detailed cost relation is shown in the following table,
based on 1973 data:

It is assumed that the cost of production of water will be
S/0.17/ni3 of water produced plus S/900,000 (fixed cost).
A yearly increase of 7% in the cost of materials is assumed for
projections. The increase is small because the change in pumps from diesel
to electricity will reduce cost, although at the same time some increase
will occur due to the pumping of water to Salinas.
Plant Maintenance
The average increase during the last two years was 6%. The main
cost are workers' salaries. A 10% annual increase in cost is foreseen.
(see "Production")
Distribution Salaries
As EMAP personnel is not making newws.termain installations, the
estimated increase in cost is low, 9%.
Distribution Expenses
A yearly 5% increase is assumed because major purchases have been
made during the last two years and further expansion will be minor.



ANNEX 7
Page 5 of 6 pages
Distribution Maintenance
The increase during the last two years was excessive (32%), but it
will be much lower, because the deficient mains are being replaced. A 6%
increase is assumed.
Technical Administration
There are no plans  or needs for any substantial increase in the
number of personnel and the salary increase will only be about 5%.  Con-
sequently, a 6% increase is used in the projections.
Social Services
This amount is based on personnel costs.  A 9% yearly increase is
assumed.
Financial Administration
Some additional personnel will be required to handle meter reading,
billing and collection from new subscribers. Therefore, a 10% increase
is assumed for 1974 followed by a 6% annual increase thereafter.
General Administration
A 6o0 yearly increase is used.
Contingencies (and Taxes)
0.5% of the direct earnings are given to the municipality. 1h.5%
more, for a total of 5%, is left for contingencies.
Real Estate Sales Tax ("Alcabalas")
This is a tax on the sale or exchange of property and depends on
the value of the property and the number of transactions. The tax has
been increasing slowly (3.1%) but shouadincrease more due to the inflation
and also to the increase in real estate transactionis after an additional 40%
or more houses obtain water and sewage through the project. A moderate increase
of 3.8% is assumed.
Public Cars
The value assigned to public buses and the corresponding taxes
were previously determined by EMAP. Now the government is appraising the
value of public vehicles, which should increase with inflation; a 7% in-
crease is assumed from the present low value of S/4OO,000.
Telephone Tax
All telephone calls in Ecuador pay L/0.05 for the water supply
in Guayaquil to compensate for a previous "non-increase" in tariff. This
tax is already partially committed to repay S9CEA. Of the approximate
110,000 telephones in Ecuador, about 45,000 are in Guayaquil. The in-
crease of this tax depends on:



ANNEX 7
Page 6 of 6 pages
(i) The increase on the number of calls.
(ii)  The increase in telephone installations.  Up to now the increase
has been very high (about 32% during the last two years). For
the comingyearx, a moderate increase of 5% is assumed, which
is smaller than the population increase in the large cities of
Ecuador.
Aliquet National Participation Fund
This is a part of the national sales tax from which 5% is given to
EkAP. The distributed part of this tax was increasing 8% per year, but
recently the government has increased it only every two years, resulting in
a 4% annual increase.
Contribution of the "Tugurios" Rehabilitation Department
A national contribution which is used for payment of works
performed in suburbs. Allocation is made according to government plan.

EMAPIS ASSET REVALUATION AND DEPRECIATION
1. Revaluation Index
The assets should be revalued in order to compensate for
inflation and to obtain a true rate of return.
Devaluation cannot be used in Ecuador as an index because
it does not reflect the true increase in cost. Furthermore, in the
past, devaluation was calculated at intervals of 5-6 years.
The "Index of Consumer Price", calculated by the Guayaquil
University with a base of 100 in 1951, would be a better index more
closely related to local inflation. Nevertheless, even the "Consumer
Index" does not accurately measure the price increase for civil engi-
neering works or for materials and equipment which are imported.
The "machinery prices" index would be better (multiplied by the ex-
change rate from dollars to sucres) to revalue imported items such
as the distribution main pipes, treatment plant equipment, machines,
tools and vehicles. The "cost of living" index could be used for
land, buildings, furniture, small distribution pipes, etc.
However, to simplify appraisal, only the index of "cost of
living" in Guayaquil is used for all assets. Using several linear
and non-linear regressions by computer for the cost of living data,
it was found that the inflation in Guayaquil is as follows:
Average Cost of
Period                        Living Growth (%)
1967 to July 1973                  7.3
Jan. 1970 to July 1973             9.6
Similar increases can be expected in the forthcoming years.
The yearly increase used in the projections is 9.6%. Data used for
the period 1973 to 1980 are based on projections of works to be executed
during the period and are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Depreciation and
net assets are shown in Table 3.

D(AP does not include in its assets the value of assets donated
by urbanizations or paid by users (meters and installations). These
assets are shown in the projections as "donations".  They are depreciated,
but not included in the rate base.

URBAN STUDIES
1.        In October 1973, the UNDP approved a technical assistance
grant of US$500,000 for a study of "TUrban Development of Guayaquil".
The terms of reference for the study will be formulated by a preparatory
technical assistance team to be sent down by the MN Center for Housing,
Building and Planning (UNCHBP) within the next few months. An addi-
tional amount of US$90,000 has been approved for this preparatory
assistance. The UNCHBP has encountered difficulty in finding suitable
persons for the preparatory assistance which will involve an urban
planner, a physical planner and an urban sociologist.
2.        The objectives and approach of the UNDP study are stated
in the basic document submitted by Government (the Junta Nacional
de Planificacion's Urban and Regional Department based in Quito)
to the UNDP. The objectives of the UNDP study are in the long-term:
(i) to plan the development of Guayaquil and its area of
influence;
(ii) raise the administrative capacity cC the Guayaquil
municipality;
(iii) fulfill the objectives of the urban sector plan of
the national plan in terms of the structure and
functions of the Guayaquil urban subsystem.
In the short run the purpose of the study is:
(i) to prepare a development plan for Guayaquil and its
area. of influence;
(ii) to prepare a program of action to tackle the social,
economic and physical problems of Guayaquil and prepare
a package of projects consistent with the development plan.



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 6 Pages
3.        The document lists specific studies to be undertaken over
the 2h-month study duration, but suffers from the attempt to be too
comprehensive. It lacks a specific project focus and provides for
little economic/fiscal resource analyses. Most "urban master plans"
completed in cities around the world have tried to be too comprehensive,
resulting in volumes of reports which have seldom gone beyond the point
of generality to the detailed project level. The other major weakness
of the proposed UNDP study is theinstitutional vacuum in which it is
conceived. The Municipality's Urban Planning Department (Departa-
mento de Planeamiento Urbano) is designated by the agency responsible
for executing the Project.  However, this department appears to have
lost the confidence of the Mayor, in addition to the difficulties it
always had in planning and coordinating the investment programs of
local public agencies such as EMAP. and EMAG.
4.        The Governor of Guayas Province and the Mayor have contracted
the international consulting firm, AITEC, to carry out detailed studies
of housing/community development problems in the suburbios. These
studies are still in their early stage, but should provide useful inputs
to the UNDF study. A consultant who participated in the BarLk appraisal
mission prepared a detailed report on the urban problems of Guayaquil
with special reference to the UNDP study. The Bank has expressed special
interest in the UNDP study and will discuss the guidelines outlined
in paras. 5-7 of this annex as well as the consultant's report with
UNDP, with the purpose of including them as part of the terms of
reference for the study.
5.        In order to ensure a significant impact, the planning study
should have very specific objectives. One way to achieve a specific
and practical orientation of the study would be to center it (through
specific projects) around the solution of a selected number of urban
problems identified as the most serious bottlenecks for the develop-
ment of the city such as:
(i) The generation of emplovment. In 1971, Guayaquil had an
unemployment rate of 9.6 percent, the highest in the country.
(ii)  The identification of future probable locations for the
extension of urban development.
(iii) Urban reform legislation. Various initiatives have been
taken in Ecuador toward the development of new land tenure
policies. They have not been very successful, however.
(iv) Intra-city transportation. Urban transport has been a
neglected area in Guayaquil up to the present time.



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 6 Pages
(v) TJrban planning and implementation institutions. Current
urban policy activities in Guayaquil suggest special need
for a strong institution to undertake urban planning and
preside over its implementation.
(vi)  Financing of urban projects for Guayaguil.  In the past,
uncertain financing has often hampered the development
of urban projects.
Topics for Study
A. Demography
(i)  Examine past and projected population growth;
(ii) Project population by income level.
B. Income and Employment Changes
(i)  Consider economic growth trends in Ecuador in terms of
its probable impact on Guayaquil (including the petroleum
industry);
(ii) Examine past and projected economic growth in Guayaquil,
new impulses, and its sensitivity to obstacles and
attractions;
(iii) Consider the income distribution pattern likely to result
from projected changes in the income levels of the popu-
lation.  Compare this with projected population change in
the corresponding income levels;
(iv)  Determine real income levels and family expenditure pattern
in the suburbio and other low-income areas with the purpose
of establishing capacity to pay for extension of public
services, such as water, electricity, roads, landfill, etc.;
(v)   Examine the type of industries and commercial activities
which should be developed to stimulate employment and growth
and their possible locations; and
(vi)  Devise program of employment development.



ANNEX1
Page 4 of 6 Pages
C.  Landholding Capacity and Development Costs
(i) Consider availability and development costs of land within
the reach of urbanization in Guayaquil, including the costs
and benefits of upgrading existing squatter areas;
(ii) Consider the suitability of the above-mentioned land with
respect to access to employment and services (by income
level);
(iii) Consider land to be needed for urbanization in view of
population growth;
(iv) Devise a sequence of preferred land acquisition. Publish
results to persuade developers. Prepare regulations and
prepare institutions to implement the regulations.
D. Low-Income Housing Studies
(i) Prepare (or collect previous) surveys of substandard housing
conditions;
(ii) Consider per unit costs of housing improvements (e.g.
in the suburbios) and house-building programs. Compare
program costs by technique and locality;
(iii) Devise a program of housing construction and improvement
for the city with special emphasis on the low-income
population.
E. Tenure Surveys - Since much urban land in Guayaquil, especially
occupied by low-income dwellings, is in uncertain tenure status, it
is important to complete studies of this kind as a prelude to under-
standing the canEequences of particular urban reform measures, and
determine who is benefitting from land value increases resulting from
public investments.
F. Urban Reform Studies - Investigate legislative options which
have been proposed for urban reform in Ecuador and relate them to
particular consequences for the welfare of families in Guayaquil.
G. Urban Transportation
(i) Determine the implications for travel demand of options
taken in land occupancy;
(ii)  Plan the removal of certain key bottlenecks in the
transportation network (such as the high tolls for the
bridge to Duran);



ANNEX 13
Page5  of 6 Pages
(iii) Study the mass transit industry in terms of solvency,
access to equipment loans, efficiency of routing and
scheduling, etc.;
F. The Costs of Utility Extensions
(i) Find standard costs of utility and urban service extensions
as functions of local fixed-cost thresholds, urban densities,
geological conditions, etc.;
(ii) Describe extension costs by zone of the metropolitan
area;
(iii) Devise programs for utility extensions.
I. Project Finance Studies - Consider sources of financingfbr
particular kinds of urban projects in order to determine their
feasibility, in particular, an examination of the resources of the
Municipalidad and related entities (EMAP, EMAG, etc.), considering
means to improve the collection of local taxes and utility charges.
Also, the possibility of introducing betterment levies for specific
projects. These studies should be undertaken early in the planning
process.
J. The Institutionalization of Planning - A special effort should be
made by the UNDP study to provide on-the-job training to young counter-
part planners in Guayaquil in order to insure a cadre of professionals
-who will continue the work after the termination of the Project. In
addition to this, care should be given to the structuring of a plan-
ning office, which would encompass the specific high priority problems
of the city and maintain all the necessary personnel components for
problem analysis and plan formation in the years to come.
The Study Process
At the beginning of the UNDP study, there should be a
precise agreement between the sponsor and the Government of Guayaquil
as to which specific problems will be treated and what counterpart
a,ency and personnel will be assigned to the study.  While a variation
of objectives during the course of study may be the outcome of more
thoughtful intention to problem priorities, it is not desirable that
all elements of concern of the government be treated. For purposes
of budgeting and accounting the allocation of man-m3nths, time should
specifically be assigned to particular solution topics.

Staffing of the Study
7.        The existing terms of reference call for twelve man-years
in three years, approxu,imately four permanent persons for three years.
Proper execution of all the relevant assignments will reouire specialists
from tine to time whose identity will become clarified as a complete
study program is developed.  The basic skills required, however, would
be the following:
(i) a specialist in project evaluation (economist or engineer);
(ii) a land-use planner;
(iii) a specialist in public administration;
(iv) a specialist in the analysis of urban services.
Specialists recuired for shorter-term assignmentsto the
Pro1ect would include:
(i) a housing specialist;
(ii) a lawyer specializing in problems of tenure and urban
reform; and
(iii) a specialist in urban transportation.
