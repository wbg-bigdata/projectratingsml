RPORT AND RECOMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE  ECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE EV:RESA MUNICIPAL DE AGUA POTABIE DE GUAYAQUIL (EMAP)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT FOR GUAYAQUIL AND THE GUAYAS PROVINCE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Empresa Municipal de Agua Potable (EMAP) of Guayaquil with the
guarantee of the Republic of Ecuador for-the equivalent of US$23.2 million
to help finance a water supply project for Guayaquil and the Guayas prov-
ince. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 4 years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4f percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONCKY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ecuador"' (No. 14a-EC) was distributed to the Executive,Directors on May
18, 1973. An updating economic mission visited Ecuador in October 1973
and its reoort is currently being prepared.Y.. Annex I summarizes the.mrai_n
economic and social indicators.
3.'       The 1973 economic report concluded that prospects for Ecuador
achieving satisfactory growth rates over the medium term were very encour-
aging. It was clear that the country's petroleum resources, though impos-
sible to estimate in quantitative terms at the time, offered the opportunity
for a faster rate,and a more balanced pattern of growth. The year 1972
was a turning point for Ecuador's economic situation. Economic growth
in real terms increased from 7.9 percent in 1971 to 9.7 percent. This
momentum was maintained through 1973 when growth reached about 10.4 percent.
The key element has been the expansion of exports, ($243 million in 1971;
$324 million in 1972; $59? million in 1973). Petroleum became Ecuador's
largest export in.1973, far exceeding bananas as the main source of
foreign exchange. Traditional agricultural export products such as coffee
and sugar have also performed well. As a consequence of petroleum exploi.-
tation the country's'economic growth prospects, in the medium term, have
changed dramatically. Overall growth rates.of.about 11 percent annually
during 1974-78 appear very feasible. 'Even assuming a substantial improvement
in Ecuador's absorptive capacity, particularly in the public sector, as well
as increases in consumption, it is clear that Ecuador will accumulate substan-
tial foreign exchange reserves during 1974-78. A substantial improvement
in public external debt is also now occurring with the debt service ratio
likely to decline from lO4 percent in 1972 to about 4 percent in 1976.
4.        With the presently proven petroleum reserves, the opportunity
offered to Ecuador by petroleum development is quite limited. Present
production is 210,000 barrels per day and would level off at 450,000 barrels
per day by 1977 with full utilization of available pipeline capacity. Net
foreign exchange earnings from petroleum amounted to about $250 million in 1973



-2-
and are expected to exceed $500 million in 1974. If presently known re-
serves are utilized at the maximum rate which currently appears feasible,
petroleum exports would cease growing by the end of the decade; Ecuador
would still remain-a poor country with a GNP per capita of less than $500
million at present prices and would require substantial external capital to
maintain .a high rate of economic growth. Ecuador's longer-term development
prospects thus depend heavily on whether substantial additional reserves
can be found. Prospects of doing so appear favorable provided the Government
accelerates current exploration efforts.
5.         Petroleum production alone will have very little direct effect
on employment and private incomes. A measure of the Government's achievement
in successfully utilizing its newly-found resources will be the degree to
which it can spread the benefits of petroleum earnings through accelerating
economic and social development.  The economy remains essentially agrarian,
the rural population-- nearly 60 percent of the total-- consisting largely of
low-income families living in conditions totally lacking in adequate health
and educational facilities.
Development Strategy
6.         The Government is aware of the task ahead and its development
strategy is focusing on overcoming the severe constraints to expanding output,
particularly domestic agriculture, correcting the unequal income distribution
and attacking the current inflationary problems besetting the country. Its
immediate task has been to control the strong inflationary pressures which
have recently developed as an outgrowth of the large influx of foreign
exchange without at the same time curbing the growth potential of critical
sectors of the economy such as agriculture. The Government has already
shown its willingness to adopt several appropriate measures in the trade,
credit and fiscal fields to achieve this objective. In order to reduce the
inflationary trends provoked by soaring petroleum prices, the Government has
set up a special fund for investment purposesUto be financed by the proceeds
of the two increases in petroleum reference price which raised it from $7.30
per barrel to the present $13.70 per barrel. These additional funds -- amount-
ing to over $175 million -- are kept separate from the regular budget and are
additional to the capital expenditures contained in the budget approved for the
current year. They are thus intended to be used only for new investment pro-
jects not now contemplated in the budget, as such projects become ready to be
financed and actually executed.  The Government has also been building up
stocks of imported food commodities in anticipation of further increases of
import prices.
7.         Another major thrust of the Government's development strategy is
directed at expansion of domestic output, partielilarly agricultural output.
The sluggish performance of agriculture is perhaps the most difficult problem
threatening the success of Ecuador's development efforts. The key to success
lies in adopting the necessary policy measures -- some of which have already
been taken -- through expanding the availability and lowering the prices of
agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, improved seeds, farm implements, etc.
and through a revision of present price controls on output. Muct. will also
depend on the land reform measures, as well as upon the Government's efforts
at ensuring a more intensive use of good coastal land, if Ecuador is to
break the long-standing backwardness of its domestic food-producing sector.



8.        Another important element in the Government's development strategy
aims at meeting the urgent need to increase the country's absorptive capacity
for investment, especially in the public sector. Substantial progress has
already been made in recent months in giving concrete content to the five-
year development plan formulated last year. An inventory of specific pro-
jects has been compiled by the Planning Agency in collaboration with the
different ministries and public sector agencies. In addition, a preinvest-
ment fund has been set up to finance prefeasibility and feasibility
studies for investment projects. The major thrust of the investment effort
is in physical infrastructure, particularly in electric power, irrigation
and transportation, designed to strengthen the foundation for long-range
expansion of the agricultural and industrial sectors. The immediate need
is to improve the capability of the public sector agencies to prepare
economically sound projects of high priority. As the process takes time
and local capabilities are limited, increased utilization of foreign
experts is essential.
9.        The final element of Ecuador's development strategy is to improve
the inadequate social services, in health, education, water supply and
sewerage facilities. These problems are acute amongst the low-income popu-
lation of the two largest urban centers, Quito and Guayaquil, as well as
in the rural areas. The Government is endeavoring to expand these much-
needed social services but progress is slow and severely limited by weak-
nesses in the ministries and agencies, as well as in project preparation
and planning.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
Bank Group Operations
10.      Since the first loan in 1954 the Bank and IDA have made eleven
loans and six credits to Ecuador amounting in total to $128.2 million, net
of cancellations. The two most recent operations, a $20 million loan for a
second development finance companies project and a $5.5 million credit for an
irrigation project, became effective at the beginning of 1974.   The major
proportion of Bank and IDA lending operations - about 40 percent - has been
for transportation, mainly for roads but including also one operation for a
new port project at Guayaquil. Agriculture and fisheries have received
about one fifth of Bank and IDA lending. In recent years Bank Group opera-
tions have focussed increasingly on this sector - primarily livestock and
irrigation projects --which since 1967 hlave represented more than two-f:ifths
of Bank lending. About 22 percent of Bank and IDA lending has been to sup-
port the industrial development activities of two development finance com-
panies, with about 13 percent for power generation and transmission for the
City of Quito. The remaining Bank Group lending has been for education.
IFC's total commitments to date have been exclusively in the industrial
sector and amount to about $4.3 million. Of this amount about $2.2
million is still held by the Corporation. Annex II contains a summary
statement of all Bank, IDA and IFC operations as of May 31, 1974,
together with notes on the execution of ongoing Bank and IDA projects.

IDB is the largest single lender, extending most of its loans to Ecuador
from the Fund for Special Operations which normally carries a 2 percent
interest rate, a ten-year grace period and repayment terms of up to forty
years. AID loans are generally for a similar period of time with interest
at 2-3 percent. The social needs, in conjunction with the agricultural
sector, have been receiving increasing attention from the international
lending agencies in recent years. In future years it is probabjs that IDB
will remain the major development lender. New loan commitments by AID are
unlikely in 1974 or 1975. On the basis of the planned lending programs of
the respective institutions IDB disbursements should average about US$30
million annually and USAID disbursements about US$6 million annually.
12.       The prospects for increased fiscal revenues and foreign exchange
from the petroleum sector have turned out to be much more favorable than
had been anticipated a year ago. Taking into consideration Ecuador's now very
favorable external currency earnings prospects and the prospective accumula-
tion of considerable reserves, foreign exchange is not likely to be a constraint
on future development efforts, at least in the next three or four years.
Ecuador is a low income country, however, whose longer term opportunities for
utilizing capital are good. Consumption needs are also rising and the demands
of the growing population for higher levels of consumption and social services
will have to be met at least in part. Moreover, while a substantial increase
Ll Another $42.4 million in agriculture was approved in 1973 but not
signed ($20.8 million Babahoyo irrigation project; $5.6 million
Foot-and-Mouth Disease; $16.0 million for AgriculturalOGredit).
2 No new loan commitments during 1973.



in foreign exchange reserves and other investments abroad should be possible
in the next few years, Ecuador would be justified in continuing to plan on
net capital inflows for the period thereafter. At the same time Ecuador's
capacity to prepare and carry out technically and economically sound invest-
ment projects remains very limited. Public sector agencies, with few excep-
tions, remain administratively very weak. Some progress has been made to-
wards rectifying these limitations by formulating a five-year development
plan and providing the resources both to finance the preparation of concrete
projects and their subsequent implementation.
13.       Bank Group lending to Ecuador is aimed at strengthening planning
and project preparation in sectors in which we have already been active and
increasingly aiding the poorer segments of the country, both in the rural
areas and in the larger urban centers. The proposed loan woujld have the
threefold objective of providing much-needed water supply services to low-
income communities, strengthening future planning in the sector and attack-
ing institutional weaknesses. W,e are well advanced in the preparation of
two additional loans, one in education with a special emphasis on Ecuador's
needs in technical education, and the other a highway loan which includes
components for feeder roads and for technical assistance.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
14.       Sanitation facilities in Ecuador are inadequate to provide for the
needs of a rapidly growing population of 6.8 million inhabitants. The
urban population alone is almost 3 million, a figure tha: is expected to
increase to 4 million by 1980. It is estimated that only two-thirds of the
urban population and as few as 10 percent of the rural population have
access to public water supply. A-p-cximately 60 percent of the urban
population is served by sewerage, a service that is practically non-existant
in the rural areas. The present deficiencies in water supply and sewerage
facilities are a primary cause of the high incidence of ;i-ater-borne diseases
and higih infant mortality rates in the country.
15.        In terms of structural organization and administrative efficiency
the sector suffers from many of the ailments afflicting almost all of Ecuador's
public sector agencies. Planning is weak, project preparation needs
strengthening and, until recently, there has been a serious shortage of
financial resources. The Ecuadorian Institute for Sanitary Works (IEOS)
and the National Planning Board are together responsible for project prepara-
tion and for the financing and construction of water supply and sewerage
systeris in communities of 2,000 inhabitants or more. In the larger urban
centers, especially Quito and Guayaquil, IEOS has responsibility only for
approving feasibility studies. The water supply and sewerage services in
these centers are the responsibility of autonomous municipal entities
(Empresas); in smaller urban communities they form a part of the responsi-
bilities of the Municipal Councils. In the rural areas of Ecuador water
supply and sewerage come under the local councils whose services are super-
vised by the Ministry of Health.



- 6 -
16.       A share of the oil royalties has recently been earmarked for IEOS, a
factor which should reduce present financial constraints and assist in the
implementation of the second national sanitation program (1973-1977). The
objectives of this program are to serve 50 percent of the total population
with water (80 percent in the urban area, 25 percent in the rural areas)
and 40 percent with sewerage (70 percent in. the urban areas, 14 percent in
rural areas). Approximately $2.2 billion sucres (US$88 million) are to be
invested over the five-year period.   Investment in this sector is expected
to double its share of total Dublic investment from a little over 5 percent
in the period 1967-72 to over 10 percent in the period 1973-76. There is,
however, reason to doubt whether this highly decentralized subsector, con-
sisting of independent and autonomous agencies, has at present sufficiently
high absorptive capacity to be able to implement such large investment pro-
grams within the time framework of the Government's development plan.   At
the request of Ecuador, a Bank/WHO cooperative program mission will visit
Ecuador later this year to review the sector's institutional and training
needs and propose improvements.
Guayaquil Water Supply Services
17.       The Empresa Municipal de Agua Potable de Guayaquil (EMAP) is an
autonomous municipal entity which sucplies water to the city of Guayaquil
and to other towns in the Province o' Guayas.   EMAP presently supplies about
50 percent of the population of Guayaquil (476,000) and about 48 percent
of the population of the sul-rounding rural communities.  The Santa Elena
peninsula towns are without a water supply system. The Guayaquil water
distribution system is inadequate and a large part of the water is unaccount-
ed for. In addition to excessive leakage in the network about half of
EMAP's customers are servec' by connections without meters. Existing
reservoir capacity in Guayaqa-' -s adequate, as are the operation and
maintenance of present production facilf-ties; water meter maintenance
and repair, however. are not satisfactory.   Sewerage services for the
city of Guayaquil are provided by the Municipality through the Guayaquil
sewerage company (EMIAG).   Th-iis is an autonomous o-ntity pr2-s9rntly ctng
as the administrative age-ncy  r a loan from 1DB.
18.      There is a conspicuous lack of' municipal urban planning in the
expansion of public utilityr services in the city of Guayaquil.  The guiding
factor in the extension o^n     r --.- a-.d se-w3rage services to residential and
industrial areas has more   `,rtc  b-e-n pclitical pressure rather than rational
planning. A number of important decisions need to be made as to how and
where future water supply and se-e-age systems should be extended.
Municipal planning is weak, however, and there is a lack of coordination
between the various institutions responsible for the urban development of
Guayaquil. To meet these needs UNDP is planning to make a grant of
US$600,000 to the Municipality of Guayaquil for a comprehensive urban dev-
elopment study of the metropolitan area. These studies would include,
inter alia, an analysis of the costs and benefits of upgrading squatter
areas, land tenure in low income a-eas, and the extension of sanitary
facilities and other community services such as transport and electricity.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.      A report, entitled "Appraisal of Water Supply Project for Guayaquil
and Guayas Province", No. 384a-EC, dated June 13, 1974, is being cir-
culated separately to the Executive Directors.   A loan and project summary
is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took place from April 24 to 26,
1974. The Borrower, the Empresa de Agua Potable de Guayaquil, was represented
by a team headed by Mr. Rafael Robles, the General Manager. The Republic of
Ecuador was represented by Dr. Orlando Gabela from the Ecuadorian Enbassy.
Project Description
20.      The major components of the project, which constitutes the first
stage of a long-range program and the first Bank loan for water supply in
Ecuador, are:
a) the provision of distribution system works within the city
of Guayaquil, involving the replacement of corroded pipes
and the expansion of the present distribution network to
the poorer sections of the city. The precise location of
about a third of the distribution system will be determined
by studies still to be carried out. It is expected that by
1977, the end of the project period, 80 percent of the
population (960,000 inhabitants) will be provided with
adequate water supply;
b)  providing the nearby towns of Duran and Daule with an
adequate water supply service to serve an additional
35,000 people;
c) construction of a water supply system for the Santa Elena
peninsula towns and nearby rural communities in-Guayas
province to supply 43,000 permanent and 24,000 seasonal
residents with water;
d) the provision of additional transmission and treatment
facilities designed to serve the needs of the city of
Guayaquil and the Guayas Drovince;
e)  the purchase and installation of 30,000 water meters for
the prospective consumters of a low-income area in Guayaquil
("Suburbio" West); and
f)  studies to prepare a water supply master plan for Guayaquil
and the neighboring areas up to the year 2000.   Also included
are funds for a feasibility study which -would cover the area's
needs up to 1985.



Project Execution
21.       The Enpresa Municipal de Agua Potable de Guayaquil (EMAP), the
proposed Borrower, will be responsible for project execution. EKAP is an
administratively independent municipal entity responsible for supplying
potable water to the city of Guayaquil and the Guayas province. It owns
its assets, prepares the budget, generates its own funds and is authorized
to receive financial assistance from othe sources. EMAP is governed by a
board of directors consisting of five members; the Chairman of the Board is
the Mayor of Guayaquil. The Board is responsible for preparing water tariffs
which then require the approval of the Planning BDard and the Ministry of
Finance. EMAP is ably managed by a competent and efficient administrator.
The present staff is adequate in size, and although somewhat limited in
technical experience2 is generally of good quality. EKAP's engineers have
received specific training abroad. Finance department personnel will require
training in the new accounting and computerized billi:g systems.  Salaries
are competitive with equivalent positions in the private sector except for
the salary of the manager, which is somewhat lower. Goverrment intentions
are to make the manager' s salary competitive0
22.       The first stage of the long-range program, which the proposed
project would help finance, would last three and one-half years and would be
completed at the end of 1977. EHAP would be directly responsible for all
aspects of project execution. The part of the project serving the Santa Elena
peninsula was orepared on the basis of studies which concluded that no ground-
water was to be found in the peninsula and that therefore it would have to be
served by a pipeline from GuayaquiL. More racenrly, however, some ground-
water has been found at Playas. E4AP has therefore employed consultants to
re-examine whether the peninsula might be served to some extent from ground-
water sources wthin ia    Tha' most likely outcoma is that the pipeline now
planned from C'uayaquil will ba shown to be nAcess8ary. There is, however,
still some possibility its size may be reduced or even that it will be
eliminated. In these cases the investment now proposed for the peninsula
could be reduced somewhat, Assurances have been obtained during negotiations
that nq, construction work would be started on this part of the project until
the studies are satisfactorily concluded (see Sections 2.02 and 3.01(b), draft
Loan Ag&eement).
23.       A water demand and system improvament study encompassing the area
of the project and a long-range water supply master plan would be carried
out with the aid of consultants contracted for the purpose by SMAP. These
studies will be closely interconnected with a comprehensive urban development
study of the Guayaquil metropolitan area which is being aided by the UNDP.
Consultants would be contracted to assist and train personnel in replac-
ing EMAP's present unsatisfactory accounting system. They would supervise
the implementation and coordination of the new accounting system which
would come into operation no later than December 1974.  During the
negotiations EMAP agreed: a) to introduce a satisfactory commercial
and cost accounting system; b) to employ external commercial auditors
on an annual basis; c) that any future merger of EMAP and any other
public utility service would take place under conditions satisfactory
to the Bank; d) to establish a satisfactory water meter maintenance



-9-
program by the end of 197h; e) to complete ongoing construction works
by March 1975; and f) to reduce substantially delays in incorporating
the readings of newly-installed meters in the billing cycle (see Sections
4.01(c), 7.07(a)(i), 5.02(i), h.05(i), 4.04, 3.07 and 5.08 respectively,
draft Loan Agreement). In addition, the Government agreed to ensure
that the water flow of river sources supplying EMAP would not be reduced
by irrigation or other works below a level that would affect the mainten-
ance of sound technical and sanitary standards (see Section 3.03(ii), draft
Guarantee Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
24.       Total project costs (which are summarized in Annex III) are
estimated at the equivalent of $38.3 million. This figure has been adjusted
for 1974 prices and includes 15 percent for physical contingencies, and price
contingencies of 10 percent for local costs and 6 percent per annum for the
foreign exchange component of the project. The foreign exchange component
is estimated to be approximately $23 million, or 60 percent of the total
project cost, and would be financed by the proposed Bank loan. Interest
during construction on the loan and local costs would be financed by EMAP.
The following table summarizes the finacing plan for 1974-1977.

25.        E4AP's large investment program, which was started in 1971, is mainly
being financed with supplier's credits and the company's net internal cash
generation. A government decision to assign taxes and municipal contributions
to the company helped EMAP to cover its participation in the financing of
the investment program. As a result, EMAP was able to maintain a satis-
factory financial position. Under the proposed project EMAP's revenues from
water sales would increase significantly, which would allow the above taxes
and municipal contributions to be phased out as a means of financing water
expansion. After 1980, such taxes will no longer be necessary for this
purpose and could be used to finance projects such as rural water supply
programs.
Tariffs
26.        Present water tariffs in Guayaquil came into effect in 1973.    The
tariff structure is progressive and based on consumption. The minimum charge
is the same for all categories though additional consumption charges are a
function of the type of consumer. The average price for metered water
(S/. 3.80 per m3) is amongst the highest in Latin America though it will
decrease as service is extended to an increasing number of low-income consum-
ers. Charges are made for installation and connection, and are reviewed every
six months. Present tariff levels are expected to be sufficient to cover
EMAP's financial needs during 197T and 1975. However, tariffs will need to be
raised in 1976 so as to provide EMAP with additional funds to maintain its
participation in the program of works. During negotiations it was agreed that
tariffs would be reviewed annually, and adjusted if necessary, to produce
revenues from the sale of water sufficient to achieve rates of return of
6 percent beginning in 1976 and 8 percent by 1980 on properly revalued net
fixed assets. (Section 5605(a) and (b) (i), draft Loan Agreement). The rate
covenant takes into account that Guayaquil is a comparatively high-income part
of the country and would enable EMAP to generate sufficient income to finance
around 40 percent of the construction investment required up to the year 1984.
27.        The Santa Elena component of the project will provide benefits to
the poor res:tdent population, as well as to the high-income seasonal population.
During negotiations it was agreed that a differential water tariff would be
designed to ensure that the seasonal population pays the full cost of provid-
ing water dui7ing the peak tourist period (see Section 5.05(b)(ii) - Schedule 5B,
draft Loan Agreement).   A subsidy to this high-income group will therefore be
avoided.
28.        The debt service coverage ratio has been satisfactory during 1972
and 1973.  The projected values up to 1°80 would have a maximum of 3.0 by
1980 and a minimum of 1.6 in 1975, both acceptable figures. During negotia-
tions it was agreed that a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5
(See Section 5.04, draft Loan Agreement) would be maintained up to 1980. It
was also agreed that EMAP would grant the Bank a lien on earmarked taxes and
other income equal to those granted to EMAP suppliers (see Sections 5.03 and
7.01(c) and 7.02(b), draft Loan Agreement).



Procurement and Disbursement
29.        EMAP will follow Bank guidelines for all material, equipment,
civil works and services to be financed out of the proceeds of the proposed
loan. Most of the contracts for equipment supply are expected to be won
by foreign firms. In the past, due to the need to have major contracts
financed by suppliers' credits, supply and civil works contracts were combined
and most civil works contracts won by foreign contractors. Bank financing
will remove this constraint and encourage participation of capable local
civil works contractors. Ecuadorian suppliers of equipment and material
would be eligible for a preference margin of up to 15 percent.
30.        The Bank would disburse the proceeds of the loan  against the
CIF costs of all direct imports, 25 percent of civil works, and the foreign
exchange costs of the engineering consultants. The Bank would also
retroactively reimburse the costs of the studies presently underway of
alternate sources of water supply for the Santa Elena peninsula and the
final project designs (up to a maximum of $100,000 for expenses incurred
after December 1, 1973). An estimated schedule of disbursements is
presented in Annex III.
Project Justification
31.       The project is the presently-estimated least-cost method to satisfy
existing water demand. The incremental rate of return for the project is
estimated to be 12 percent, a calculation based only on the consumer's will-
ingness to pay as *reflected in the water tariffs. However, the incremental
revenue understates the benefits consumers receive from the project. Other
benefits derived from the project not fully covered   in this calculation
include:
a) Health benefits derived from a consumption of safe,
treated water;
b)  Improvements in the water service to low-income areas.
Inadequately treated water at high costs purchased from
tank trucks will now be replaced by an adequate supply
of safe water on the user's premises;
c) Increases in land values, as a consequence of the installa-
tion of water supply and sewerage services, particularly
in the Santa Elena peninsula and the Suburbio area.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Empresa Municipal
de Agua Potable de Guayaquil, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of Ecuador and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
the Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.  The draft agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans for water supply projects.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECONMENDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 379-EC/Credit No. 51-EC - Second Highway Project: $9.0 million Loan and
$8.0 million Credit both of May 26, 1964;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project, financed jointly by the Bank, IDA, the IDB and AID,
has been completed. However, a further extension in the Closing Date has been
requested to permit the use of a balance of funds under the Credit account for
financing a highway master plan and engineering services. This additional work
is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 12h-EC - Education Project; $5.1 million Credit of June 27, 1968;
Closing Date: August 31, 1974
Execution of the project had a slow start mostly due to difficulties
in setting up the project organization, lack of counterpart funds and delays in



ANNEX II

the recruitment of experts. Although projeot icn-lementation is about two
and one-half years behind schedule the aforemertioned difficulties have been
overcome and the project is running smoot:-~y.  T-he Government authorized the
use of part of a former bond issue to finance local funds for the project
and the lack of these funds should not arise again during the remainder of the
disbursement period.
Loan No. 555-EC - Fisheries Project:  I.3 i      lion. Loan of September 5, 1968;
Closing Date: Ocv_3e>_'_ j9?7
Execution of this _ oject --so had a slow start duie mainly to
institutional problems and delays in finding prospective sub-borrowers.   The
first four fishing vessels have been delivered but procurement of further
vessels remains at a standstill. The fishing port feasibility study is now
progressing well and should be completed in October 1974. An extension in the
scope of the study is currently being considered which would focus on the
facilities needed to improve th.e conditions of inshore fz>-.eries.  It is likely
that a small part of the loan will be cancelled.
Credit No. 222-EC - Third Livestock Develioment Project; $10.0 million Credit
of Decembar 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Disbursemerns on this Credit are be1ind schedule due primarily
to two outstanding problems - on the interest rate and cn the organizational
arrangements for the project - which brought the project to a standstill in
April 1973. These difficulties have only recently been resolved.    A memoran-
dun proposing amendments to the Credit Agreement was approved by the Executive
Directors on a non-objection boasis on March 4, l974I    -t is  expected
that the remainder of the Credit -.` ll be disb--sei,x4.'Jou' further problems.
Loan No. 721-EC - Development Finance Co-mpanles P-o,-ect; $8.0 million Loan of
February 5, 1971; Closing Daze: June I_ 1974
Executior cf this project is s-Jisfactory.   Full disbursement
is expected early in 1975 which will require an ex-tension of the Closing Date.
Credit No. 286-EC - Third Power Project; $6.8 million Credit of February 15,
1972; Closing Date:   une 3 n
This project is one-year behind schedule due to delays in
implementing a tariff.increase and to the consultants not yet having completed
some of the engineering and specifications. Because of these delays an exten-
sion of the Closing Date will be necessary.

1973; Closing Date:  Augus53,'1979
The Credit was declared effectJive on January 17, 1974.  The
