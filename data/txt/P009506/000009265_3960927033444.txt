POWER DISTRIBUTION ~16 TOWNS) PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               People's Republic of Bangladesh
Beneficiary:            Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)
Amount:                 SDR 64.7 million (US$87.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                  Standard, with 40 years maturity
Onlending Terms:        The Government  would  onlend  the  proceeds  of the
credit to BPDB at a rate of 7.65Z p.a. 'or a period
of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
BPDB would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Descri)tion:   The  project's   main   objectives   would   be  to:
(a) expand   and   strengthen   B?DB's  distribution
systems in 16 towns to meet forecast demand at least
cost; (b) stabilize system voltage and increase
system reliability; (c) reduce power losses in
transmission    and    distribution    system,   and
(d) strengthen     BPDB's      organizational     and
institutional performance by implementing an agreed
reform program. The project would comprise erection
of about 92 km of 33-kV lines, extension of low-
voltage   distribution   networks   in   16   towns,
procurement of spare parts for power stations and
substations, installation of capacitora and reactive
compensation equipment and of meters and metering
equipment, provision of desk-top computers, and
technical assistaace to BPDB.
Risks:                  The  principal  risks  concern  possible  delays  in
project implementation, both in procurement and
during construction. To minimize procurement risks,
bids for all major contracts and proposals from the
consultants have already been invited. The risk of
construction delays because of domestic financial
resource  constraints   would   be  reduced  through
implementation of measures to enhance BPDBWs cost
recovery, including reducing system losses, and
increasing  its  revenues.    Possible  cons ruction
delays would also be minimized by ensuring £.fective
management of project engineering and supervision by
the formation of four new construction divisions by
September 30, 1989.

BANGLADESH
POWER DISTRIBUTION (16 TOWNS) PROJECT
I. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Sectoral Importance
1.01     The energy sector plays  a  key  role in Bangladesh's development.
Given its severe resource limitations and persistent balance of payments
constraints, the country needs an efficient energy sector to promote
economic growth, reduce foreign exchange outlays on energy imports and
mobilize resources for sector entities and the Government budget. However,
shortages of both foreign and local resources, caused primarily by the
under-pricing of energy and the absence of a coordinated plan for
channeling foreign assistance to priority investments, have impeded the
achievement of energy targets.   Scarce, unreliable power supply constrains
overall economic growth, and only 52 of the population has access to
electricity.    The  Government's  Third  'ive-Year  Plan  (TFYP) (FY86-90)
recognizes the need for the energy sector's accelerated development and
earmarks about 162 of total public allocations for the sector (para. 1.13).
B. Energy Resources and Supply
1.02     Bangladesh's principal  commercially  exploitable energy resources
consist of substantial reserves of relatively low-cost natural gas, limited
hydropower  potential.    There  are  also  potential  oil,  coal  and peat
resources for which the economic feasibility has yet to be determined. At
present, substantial quantities of oil are still imported. About 41? of
total energy supply is from commercial resources, and the remainder is from
traditional fuels in the form of crop residues, animal dung and wood. In
FY86, domestic sources (natural gas and hydropower) accounted for 59X and
imported sources (oil and coal) for 412 of commercial energy supplies.
1.03     Natural Gas and Oil.  Natural gas output increased from 45 billion
cubic feet in FY80 to about  146  in  FY88.    It is now the main source of
commercial energy, accounting for over 582 of supply compared to 36Z in
FY80.   Estimated  recoverable  reserves,  all  located  in  the  east zone
(para. 2.07), are about 10 trillion cubic feet, sufficient to meet expected
demand for another 20 years, and prospects are good for increasing the
reserves. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has accorded high priority to
these reserves' development; under the Energy Sector Adjustment Credit,
ESAC (para. 1.16), it would review the gas exploration and development
program annually with IDA. Oil was recently discovered in the Sylhet gas
field area; however, it is too early to estimate the find's full
significance. Under the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit
1402-BD) GOB is pursuing and is preparing promotional packages aimed at
attracting international oil companies to undertake petroleum exploration.
With these efforts  petroleum  imports  are  being  reduced.   In FY87 they
claimed about 13Z of the country's limited foreign exchange earnings,
compared to 24Z in FY86.



-2-
1.04     Coal and Peat.  Several thick coal seams up to depths of less than
200 meters have recently been located in the Barapukaria area of Dinajpur
District in the west zone.    With  the assistance of consultants funded by
the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), U.K, GOB is assessing the
technical and economic feasibility of mining  this coal.   The consultants'
mid 1988 report estimated total potentially mineable resources of 265
million tons, with an average heating value (11,400 British Thermal
Units/lb). The report is being reviewed by GOB, ODA and IDA in preparation
for more detailed studies. Good peat deposits are known to exist in the
Faridpur and Khulna  districts  in  the  west  zone.   The Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB) is assessing the potential for mining and
processing peat and installing a small experimental generation plant.
1.05     Hydropower.  Bangladesh's hydropower   otential is estimated to be
about 1,500 GWh/year, of which 1,050 GWh/yeaL nas been developed with the
installation of 330 MW capacity, on the Karnafuli river at Kaptai (near
Chittagong). Two other prospective hydro sites have been investigated in
the  same  area;  however,  since   their  development  would  require  the
relocation of about 30,000 people, no detailed engineering studies have
been undertaken.
1.06     Traditional Fuels.  Per  capita  biomass supplies are continuously
diminishing, and increases in forest-based fuelwood or a major shift to
commercial fuels are not viable options to meet the supply gap due to che
high population density and low income levels. Although, there is evidence
that there is an increase in the substitution of commercial fuels for
traditional fuels. It is therefore important for GOB to improve biomass
recovery and conversion efficiency, e.g. in cooking stoves, charcoal kilns
and other wood-burning equipment.    GOB  has  agreed under the joint World
Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme to undertake an
inter-fuel substitution study in mid 1989 to: (i) assess the micro and
macro economic impacts of substitution; and (ii) formulate a least-cost
strategy fo: meeting commercial energy needs.
C. Energy Consumption
1.07     Bangladesh's per capita commercial  energy consumption of about 42
kilograms of oil equivalent per annum is among the lowest in the world
(about one-ninth of the average for low-income countries). In FY86, gross
commercial energy consumption was about 4.2 million tons of oil equivalent,
of which natural gas accounted for 582, petroleum 39?, hydropower 1?, and
coal 2Z. However, with the accelerated development of gas supplies, the
consumption of commercial energy increased relatively rapidly at 5.3Z a
year during FY80-86, compared with the annual growth rate of about 3.8? for
real GDP. The GDP elasticity was thus about 1.4, compared to the average
of 1.1 for developing countries.   The  bulk of gas consumption is in power
generation  (42Z)   and   fertilizer   production   (34?);  however,  other
industrial, commercial and domestic uses are expanding steadily. There is
considerable inefficiency in commercial energy use and hence substantial
scope for improvement, particularly in industry, petroleum refining and
electric power transmission  and  distribution.    These would be addressed
through the Industrial Energy Efficiency Project (Credit 1942-BD) as well
as the proposed  Project.    Per  capita non-commercial energy consumption,
which grew at about 2.3? per annum during FY80-86, is estimated at 60
kilograms of oil equivalent per year.



-3-
1.08     With increased gas availability  and GOB's previous pricing policy
of maintaining gas prices low  relative to petrolb.m products (para. 1.11),
the country's dependence on imported energy was significantly reduced
during FY80-86 from about 60? to 412 of the total commercial energy needs.
As a result of the success of GOB's policy of substituting indigenous
natural gas for imported energy, the share of crude oil and petroleum
products in commercial energy supply declined from 55Z in FY80 to 39? in
FY86. However, petroleum products are still a dominant source of energy in
the transportation sector. Despite this decline in the relative importance
of petroleum products and the global decline in petroleum prices, petroleum
imports continue to be substantial and claimed about 132 of the country's
limited foreign exchange earnings in FY87 (para. 1.03).
D. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.09     The principal institutions  responsible  for  energy sector policy
ares (i) the Planning Commission, which is responsible for macroeconomic
planning, including the Five-Year Plans and the Annual Development Plans
(ADP's), and for approving all capital investments costing more than Tk 5.0
million (US$159,000) and (ii) the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
(MEMR), which is responsible for overseeing the operations of the four
principal publicly-owned energy sector entities which produce, transport
and deliver most of Bangladesh's commercial energy. The entities are BPDB,
the Rural Electrification Board (REB), the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals
Corporation (BOGMC), and the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC). BPDB
is responsible for electricity generation, transmission and distribution,
except in areas served by REB.   REB is responsible for the construction of
rural electrification schemes and organizing prospective consumers into
semi-autonomous cooperatives called Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs) which buy
electricity from BPDB and distribute it to their consumers. BOGMC is
responsible for the exploration, production and delivery of natural gas and
the exploration and development of oil and solid minerals, including coal.
Natural gas is produced, transmitted and distributed by five regional
companies under BOGMC's control. Under the ESAC, GOB has agreed to divest
BOGMC of its operational activities and reorganize it under a set of
separate  operating  companies  established   along  functional  lines  for
exploration and drilling, production, transmission and distribution of gas.
BPC is responsible for purchasing and refining crude oil and marketing
petroleum products. The refining operation is carried out at Bangladesh's
only refinery by, Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL), a BPC subsidiary.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is bottled and sold to private miarketing
companies by LPG Limited, another BPC subsidiary. Petroleum product and
LPG marketing is carried out by three other BPC subsidiaries.
1.10     The exceptions to public  sector  domination  of the energy sector
are in traditional energy and in the distribution of petroleum products
handled by BPC subsidiaries, which rely primarily on privately-owned road
and river tankers for transport and on private dealers for local retailing.
Although the petroleum distribution system is operating satisfactorily, the
expected future growth in demand for commercial energy may stretch the
system's capability to meet demand efficiently. Consequently, there may be
scope  for  increasing  private   sector  participation.    Private  sector
participation is also being encouraged in other areas of the energy sector.



-4-
Private sector involvement in the distribution of LPG in Khulna is being
promoted under the Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery and Distribution
Project (Credit 1749-BD). Further. GOB is seeking to increase private oil
exploration through promotional packages under the Petroleum Exploration
Promotion Project (Credit 1402-BD) (para. 1 ().
E. Energy Pricing
1.11     GOB's  key  energy  pricing  policy  objectives  include  economic
efficiency, resource mobilization  and  equity.    Accordingly, it has been
increasing energy prices to reflect the costs to Bangladesh of meeting
consumers' energy requirements, while minimizing the adverse effects on
low-income consumers.   In  accordance  with  this  policy, gas prices were
increased by an average  of  20%  annually  during  FY86-89.   In FY89, the
average gas price was about Tk 39.2/MCF, which is slightly above the
estimated long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of  supply  (Tk 38.2/MCF).   In
accordance with its efficiency and resource mobilization objectives, GOB
intends to maintain current price levels for petroleum products to ensure
that the weighted average domestic price (net of distribution, marketing
and other handling costs) is at least 115Z of the border price.
1.12     Electricity tariffs have been  raised  frequently in recent years.
During FY8O-88, BPDB's average tariff rates were increased at an annual
average rate of about  A'.4Z in nominal  terms and about 4.52 in real terms,
with a total increase of  422  in  real  terms.   The average tariff is now
Tk 1.96/kWh.    Under  the  Second  Rural  Electrification  Project (Credit
1633-BD) and the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Credit
1648-BD), GOB, BPDB, and REB agreed to carry out a tariff study based on
LRHC  and  to  implement  agreed  recommendations.    Coopers  and  Lybrand
Associates Ltd. (UK), completed the study in August 1986 and highlighted
var'ous deficiencies, including an excessive number of tariff categories,
tariff rates lower than the economic costs of supply, significant cross-
subsidization, and little incentive to reduce consumption during the
system's peak period.   Based  on  the  tariff  study, GOB introduced a new
simplified tariff for BPDB in August 1987. The number of tariff categories
was reduced from 19 to 10; new two-rate time-of-day tariffs for 33-kV and
11-kV consumers and an optional time-of-day tariff for large low-voltage
consumers were introduced; and the sizes of the subsidized blocks of energy
for residential consumers were greatly  reduced.   In the PBSs, tariffs for
residential consumers were changed from a constant rate to three block
increasing rates to limit electricity consumption at heavily subsidized
rates.   The  new  tariff  structures  greatly  improved  the signals which
electricity prices give to consumers about the costs to Bangladesh of
meeting their consumption requirements.       On  May 1, 1987 the bulk supply
tariff rate was increased by 20Z, and on August 1, 1987 the existing tariff
for all other consumers was increased by about 1;2. Further, PBSs' average
tariff rates were increased by about 252 on July 1, 1987. As a result of
the FY89 gas price increase, electricity tariffs for all consumers were
increased by about 32 on July 1, 1988. Following these tariff increases,
BPDB's overall average tariff rate is about 702 of LRMC. The tariff rate3
for supplies to industrial and commercial consumers exceed LRHC while the
tariff rates for residential consumers (except the third block) and bulk
rates to PBSs are below LRMC. Despite the series of tariff increases, BPDB
has not been able to meet its financial covenants (para. 4.17).

F. GOB's Energy Sector Strategy
1.13     Recogniz!-g the Importance  of  improving  energy supplies to meet
forecast demand, GOB accorded high priority to the energy sector in the
TFYP  (para.  1.01).    The  TFY?'s  principal  energy  objectives  are to:
(i) accelerate the development of domestic natural gas resources to reduce
the country's dependence on imported oil; (ii) improve the reliability and
quality of power supply and reduce power system losses: (iii) improve
energy use and efficiency through conservation measures and appropriate
pricing policies; (iv) meet energy demands at least cost to the economy;
(v) improve the energy sector entities' performance; and (vi) encourage the
private sector's participation in the energy sector particularly in gas and
oil exploration.    Following  donor-funded  studies,  GOB  has implemented
agreed recommendations regarding policy changes, capital inveatments,
pricing decisions and resource mobilization with some meas;:re of success
(paras. 1.09 to 1.12).   However,  due  to over ambitious and uncoordinated
investment plans and local currency constraints, implementation of capital
investment programs have  not  proceeded  as  planned.    To underscore its
commitment to the sector's development, GOB allocated Tk 61 billion (US$2.0
billion equivalent) at FY85 prices for energy investments under the TFYP.
Energy accounts for 16Z of the total public allocation, compared with about
122 under the Second Five-Year Plan, and is exceeded only by the allocation
to the agricultural sector.
G. Bank Group Involvement in the Energy Sector
1.14     Lending in the  power  and  gas  subsectors  has been designed toz
(i) strengthen investment planning to meet forecast demand for gas and
electricity at least cost, (ii) improve sectoral institutions' performance
and provide training, (iii) optimize the use of available energy resources
through appropriate energy pricing and conservation measures, (iv) appraise
discovered gas fields and optimize their development, and (v) attract
private capital to intensify oil exploration.
1.15     Since 1973 IDA has supported  GOB's energy strategy through twelve
credits, amounting to US$608 million equivalent, representing about 19? of
IDA resources committed to Bangladesh.   Six  of the credits were for power
projects aggregating to US$303 million, while the remaining six credits,
totalling US$305 million, were for other energy projects. The credit for
the Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (Credit 934-BD) was closed on
June 30, 1986. A supplementary credit of US$8 million (Credit 1504-3-BD)
for the Rural Electrification Project was also closed on June 30, 1986,
although the principal credit (Credit 1262-BD) is still effective. A
review of the Khulna Power Project indicates that changes in design and
delays in procurement occurred due to inadequate system studies and
detailed design. Based on that experience, BPDB has strengthened its
planning and design organizations to ensure that all major system studies
and bid  documents  are  prepared  in  a  timely  manner.    Except for the
procurement problems in the initial  stages  of the project, BPDB's project
implementation was  satisfactory.    Implementation  of  the Ashuganj Power
Project (Credit 1254-BD) was very good, and the project was completed in
June 1988, twelve months before credit closing date.



-6-
1.16     Although considerable  progress  was  achieved  through  the above
projects, they did not provide an effective means to rationalize the entire
energy  investment  program  and   address  issues  affecting  the  overall
organization of Bangladesh's power and petroleum subsectors (para. 1.13).
Thus during FY87, GOB and IDA developed a comprehensive energy sector
program, including investment planning, institutional development and
energy pricing and resource mobilization agreed to be implemented under the
ESAC. The ESAC would provide a policy framework for investment projects
which would thus need relatively few, mainly project specific conditions to
ensure their effective implementation.
1.17     Under the ESAC, it  has  been  agreed that new capital investments
would be focused on priority projects under an agreed Priority Investment
Program (PIP). In the power subsector, the priority lies in the proper
planning and development of the distribution system which is presently
badly overloaded resulting in high technical losses, lower than normal
supply voltage levels, and high outage rates (paras. 2.11 and 3.01).
Accordingly, GOB has included this project, which is designed to address
these deficiencies, in the PIP.
H. Co-Financing and Donor Coordination
1.18     Under  Credits  934-BD,  1254-BD,  and  1586-BD,  there  has  been
significant co-financing between IDA and the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
Kreditanstanlt fuer Wiederaufbau (KEW), Canadian International Development
Agency  (CIDA),  Kuwait  Fund   for   Arab  Economic  Development  (KFAED),
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the United
Nations Development Programme  (UNDP).         Furthermore, during discussions
leading to the proposed PIP, donors representing twelve major bilateral and
multi-lateral  agencies  attended  several  coordination  meetings.    This
coordination is likely to result in substantial co-financing of the ESAC by
KfW and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF).
II. THE BENEFICIARY
A. Organization of BPDB
2.01     Prior to the establishment of  East Pakistan (Bangladesh) in 1947,
responsibility for the planning, construction and operation of power
facilities was vested with the Government's Public Works Department under
the Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity Rules of 1937. The East
Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA) was formed in
1958, and after Bangladesh became independent in 1971, EPWAPDA was
reorganized into BPDB, the beneficiary of the proposed Credit, a statutory
autonomous government body established under Presidential Order No. 59 of
1972. The Presidential Order required BPDB to seek government approval on
almost all policy, administrative, financial and personnel matters and in
effect significantly diminished the authority's decision-making capability
and autonomy. Instead of confining itself to broad policies, GOB has been
increasingly involved in BPDB's day-to-day functioning, in such matters as
setting salary levels and structure, bonus incentives, the selection of
officers for training,   budget  proposals  and  award of contracts.  GOB's
involvement in BPDB's daily operations, concentration of decision-making at



-7-
the highest levels of management and the influence of the trade unions are
major impediments to BPDB's efficient  operation.   MEMR is responsible for
BPDB,  through  which  it  reports  to  GOB  and  communicates  with  other
ministries (para. 1.09).
B. BPDB Management and Staffing
2.02     BPDB's management consists of  a  Chairman  and not more than five
Members,  all  appointed  by  GOB.        The  Members  are  responsible  for
generation/transmission, distribution, planning/development, finance and
administration. GOB determines the Chairman's and Members' tenure, terms
and conditions of appointment and can appoint and dismiss Members at any
time. Since 1972, two of the five Board Members (Administration and
Finance) and the Chairman have generally been government officials from
outside the power  sector.    During  the  past  14  years  BPDB has had 10
different  Chairmen.    Recognizing   the   negative  effects  of  previous
practices, in June 1987 GOB appointed a Board Member who is a professional
engineer with over  30  years  experience  in  BPDB  as  its Chairman.  The
Chairman's relationship to the Members  and  departments is shown in BPDB's
organization chart (Annex 2.1).
2.03     BPDB's main  operating  functions  are  organized into departments
responsible  for  planning   and   development,  generation,  transmission,
distribution and commercial operations.       This departmental structure has
been mainL4.aned since pre-independence,  with  a Chief Engineer responsib!e
for Ocircles" which are further split into "divisions" and "sub-divisions".
In December 1987, BPDB had about 25,000 employees, compared to about 28,700
sanctioned positions.  Employees by grade  were:   Class I, about 7Z; Class
II, about 6Z; Class III, about 52Z; and Class IV (unskilled), about 352.
About 502 of the employees work in the distribution function, 101 in
commercial and  the  remainder  in  other  operations.   Graduate engineers
account for about 5Z of the total strength, diploma engineers for about 6Z,
and non-engineering officers for  about  2Z.    In  FY87, BPDB served about
963,000 consumers, giving a consumer/employee ratio of about 38:1. This
very low ratio indicates BPDB is considerably overstaffed in the non-
management cate3ories, although it is significantly better than the FY78
ratio of 20:1. This overstaffing, combined with the organization of BPDB's
staff into 75 trade unions affiliated to three labor federations, each with
strong political links, is one of the causes of BPDB's overall poor
performance (paras. 2.15  and  4.16).    In  the present political climate,
progress in resolving BPDB's difficulties in these areas is expected to be
slow.
2.04     In  an  effort   to   improve   BPDB's  performance,  during  ESAC
negotiations GOB  agreed  to  employ  consultants  to  conduct a diagnostic
review to identify the factors impeding BPDB's efficient operation and
development and to formulate proposals to strengthen it. The final report
of the consultants, who were financed by ODA (UK), was reviewed and
discussed in Dhaka in mid-1988 by ADB, BPDB, GOB, IDA, and ODA. GOB has
agreed to implement a dated reform program based on the consultants'
recommendations,   including    the    following    salient    key   action
(para. 6.01(a)):



-8-
(i)  BPDB  would  delegate   necessary  administrative,  financial  and
commercial powers to BPDB's Zonal Chief Engineers to improve the
each zone's performance by July 1, 1989;
(ii)  BPDB would reallocate  the  assets  between  BPDB  and the new and
autonomous Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) by January 1,
1990. DESA would be responsible for the distribution functions in
the Dhaka area;
(iii) BPDB would agree on tariffs, points of supply and billing
mechanism between BPDB and DESA by January 1, 1990;
(iv) GOB would take all legislative actions to establish DESA and
reorganize BPDB by March 31, 1990; and
(v) GOB would appoint District officers in DESA and take all actions
required to make DESA operational by July 1, 1990.
2.05     To assist BPDB  implement  the  above  program,  GOB has agreed to
request ODA (U.K.) financing for about 200 man months of consulting
services, of which about 150 would be for local consultants.
C. Training
2.06     BPDB attaches considerable importance  to  training and has received
assistance from many donors, including IDA, ADB and UNDP, for the development
of its training programs. Under the Member for Administration, the Director
of Training and Career Development is responsible for training. BPDB has set
up training institutions at Kaptai, Tongi, Ghorasal, Chittagong, Khulna and
Rajshahi. Every year about 2,000 employees, including linesmen, helpers, and
senior staff up to superintending engineers, participate in management
seminars and specialized  courses  in  these  institutions.   During FY82-87,
about 400 employees were trained abroad under various sponsorship programs in
generation, transmission,  distribution  and  management.    Under the Khulna
Power Distribution Project (Credit 934-BD), IDA financed the upgrading of the
Khulna training center to provide improved training facilities for power
distribution specialists (foremen, linesmen, cable jointers). Under Credit
1648-BD, the training center is being expanded to provide hotline maintenance
and erection training for local distribution works. However, BPDB staff also
require training in distribution system planning and in the computerization
of billings and maintenance of commercial accounts. BPDB intends to provide
familiarization  and  training  for   about   60   engineers  and  about  100
accountants. Under the proposed Project, 25 desk-top computers would be
installed in each of the Regional Account Offices (RAO) and necessary
training would be imparted (para. 4.06). Design, procurement of hardware and
software and training in use of software will be provided by a contractor
(Annex 2.2).
D. Existing Facilitier
2.07     Bangladesh is divided into east  and  west zones by the Ganges/Padma
and Brahmaputra/Jamuna River systems.    With  the  commissioning of a 230-kV
double circuit interconnector (energized at 132-kV) in December 1982, the
power systems in the two zones were interconnected, enabling BPDB to



-9-
substitute oil-fired generation in the west with gas-fired generation from
the east, resulting in a 21) reduction of average fuel cost per kWh from
FY82-FY87. In FY88, BPDB's total firm generating capacity was 1798 MW,a/ an
increase of 232 over FY87 (Annexes 2.3 and 2.4), comprising 230 MW
hydroelectric plant, 1199 MW natural gas fired plants and 369 MW of plants
fired by liquid fuels.    The  maior generating stations and load centers are
interconnected by 2,350 km of 132-kV transmission lines and 167 km of 66-kV
sub-transmission lines (Annex 2.5), and many reinforcements and extensions to
the system are planned or under construction (Annex 2.6). The distribution
system consists of about 8,086 km of 33-kV lines and 26,714 km of 11 and
0.4-kY lines. The system is operated by 259 Electric Supply Units (ESUs),
BPDB's smallest administrative  units.    Because  of insufficient numbers of
33/11-kV and 11/0.4-kV substations, some of the 11 and 0.4-kV lines are very
overloaded  causing  excessive  voltage   drops  and  high  technical  losses
(paras. 1.17 and 2.11).
2.08     Total energy generated by BPDB's power plants in FY88 was 6,542 GWh,
a 17Y increase over FY87, including 5,753 GWh (88Z) in the east zone, of
which 1173 GWh were transferred to the west zone through ,the interconnector
(para. 2.07). The remaining 789 GWh (15Z) was generated in the west zone
(Annex 2.7). At the end of FY87, the total number of consumers supplied by
BPDB was about 963,000, with 632,800 domestic and 257,500 commercial
(including street lighting) consumers (Annex 2.8). Another 269,000 consumers
have been connected by PBSs through the REB program, of which about 211,000
are domestic consumers.
E. Maintenance of Facilities
2.09     Due to a  shortage  of  generating  capacity which continued through
FY86 BPDB was unable to shut down any large generating units for planned
maintenance, resulting in high outage rates. However, with the commissioning
of about 500 MW of thermal generating capacity at Askuganj and Ghorasal in
FY87 and the procurement of spare parte mainly funded by KfW and ADB, BPDB is
now carrying out maintenance on its older units and has requested InA
financing for additional urgently needed spare parts for both these power
stations and also for high voltage substations and transmission works costing
about US$11.5 (Annex 2.9).   BPDB  is  preparing  details of its future spare
parts requirements to be financed under the proposed Power Distribution and
Rehabilitation Project. In addition, BPDB urgently needs tools and testing
equipment, the shortage of which has hampered the scheduled maintenance of
power plants and grid substations.    The  proposed Project also provides for
tools and testing equipment.
F. Power Planning
2.10     Generation and  Transmission.    Power  subsector  planning has been
adhoc  and  in  the  generation   area   has  generally  been  influenced  by
availability of donor funds.   In  May  1983, to rectify this situation, BPDB
set up a planning cell to prepare a Power System Master Plan (PSIP) for
FY85-05. Under TA funded by UNDP and executed by ADB, BPDB completed a
least-cost development plan in February 1985, with the assistance of Acres
International (Canada), and GOB/BPDB agreed that suture capital investment
plans would  be  based  on  these  least-cost  options.    In  FY88, with the
a/ In addition, industrial captive plant capacity is about 200 MW.



-10-
assistance  of  Electrowatt  of   Switzerland,  BPDB  updated  its  long-term
generation and transmission plans in the course of preparing the feasibility
study for the next east zone thermal power station. The BPDB planning cell
created to prepare the PSMP has developed in-house capabilities to carry out
computerized system studies for planning its high voltage transmission
system.
2.11     Distribution.   Although  there  are  high  technical  losses in the
distribution systems, the PSMP did not pay adequate attention to distribution
planning (para. 2.10). Over the years, the distribution system has expanded
but the focus has been on meeting load growth and adding more consumers
without  due  regard  to  improving   and  renovating  the  existing  system.
Annually, about 75,000 new consumers are added to the system. In the Second
Five-Year Plan (FY81-85), about 35Z of the sectoral investment allocation was
allotted to the distribution, and in the TFYP (FY86-90), the level is
expected to be about 321.    In  the  absence of a well-designed distribution
plan, these resources are used in expanding the system and adding more
consumers. GOB has completed the initial phase of the distribution expansion
in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and other major towns. However,
insufficient attention has been given to optimizing designs to reduce
technical losses. The present system has thus become inefficient, has high
technical losses (paras. 2.13-2.18) with inadequate voltage levels, and high
outage rates. The proposed Project would focus on these deficiencies, and
the design of the distribution systems for the sixteen towns included in the
proposed project will reduce the technical  losses  by about 1.5z.   A review
of the entire distribution system by UNDP-financed consultants should enable
BPDB to reduce technical losses and renovate the remaining distribution
system under subsequent power distribution and rehabilitation projects
(para. 2.16).
2.12     Priority and Annual Investment  Programs.    Under the ESAC, GOB has
agreed to prepare and implement a three-year rolling energy sector priority
investment program (PIP) and to ensure that adequate Taka resources would be
allocated for its implementation.   BPDB's investment program for FY88-95, is
shown in Annex 2.10. This includes BPDB's PIP for the three years FY89-91
together with the financing plan beyond FY91. Under the proposed Project GOB
has agreed that by April 30 of each year, commencing not later than April 30,
1990 it would (i) review with IDA the implementation of the PIP for BPDB for
the current fiscal year and (ii) prepare and furnish to IDA for comments, the
PIP, including the sources for the financing thereof, for the subsequent
three fiscal years. Thereafter such programs as agreed with IDA would be
carried out in a timely manner (para. 6.01(b)).
G. System Losses
2.13     System losses  continue  to  be  the  single  most important element
affecting BPDB's operational and financial performance, with losses of 35-46?
of gross generation in FY80-88.    Analysis indicates that technical and non-
technical losses  each  constitute  about  50?  of  the  total  losses.   The
technical losses are primarily due to improperly planned and inadequately
designed distribution systems (para. 2.11), while improper billing, illegal
connections, and incorrect metering are the primary causes of non-technical



-11-
loRses. For example, high and medium voltage consumers, who constitute less
than 1Z of consumers but consume about 45Z of energy, own their meters,
permitting corrupt practices.
2.14     The effects  of  these  inordinately  high  system  losses are that:
(i) BPDB loses substantial revenues (e.g. in FY87 the reduction of losses by
one percentage point and their conversion into sales would have increased
BPDB's revenue by about US$3.0 million or about 1.5Z of its FY87 operating
revenue); and (ii) GOB/BPDB has to increase tariffs to levels otherwise not
required to achieve agreed financial targets (e.g., in FY87 a one percentage
point reduction in system losses would have enabled BPDB to achieve the
agreed financial rate of return on assets with a 1OZ lower tariff increase).
Due to high technical losses, BPDB has to incur increased capital investment
expenditures and attendant debt service and operating expenses, or it has to
operate an inefficient, unreliable system with forced load shedding.
2.15     Over the past ten  years  numerous  efforts  have been made by BPDB,
assisted by multilater&l and bilateral agencies to reduce system losses
through site investigations, analyses, technical assistance, procurement of
meters and metering equipment, reactive compensation equipment and capital
investments for expansion of the distribution system in selected towns. In
1982 BPDB attempted to improve its commercial management by transferring the
metering and billing responsibilities of its 18 major ESUs to the newly
created position of General Manager Commercial Operations (GMCO), under the
Member of Finance (para. 4.03). Unfortunately, these efforts did not succeed
in reducing system losses, as most of the investments in the distribution
system have been made to meet load growth and not to reduce losses.
Additionally,  BPDB's  metering   and   billing   procedures  are  defective,
connections are sometime given without meters, meters are often not sealed,
old meters are not calibrated and adequate staff are not provided in the
Commercial Section, all of which lead to high non-technical losses. In
addition, the three labor federations try to interfere in BPDB's appointments
or transfer of staff (para. 2.03).
2.16     Under the  provisions  of  Credit  1648-BD,  BPDB  appointed a UNDP-
financed consultant to address the problem of losses, improve its consumer
accounting including appropriate metering and billing, reduce non-technical
losses and prepare investment plans and guidelines for renovating the
overloaded distribution system  to  reduce  technical  losses.   Lowever, the
United Nations Department for Technical Cooperation and Development (UNDTCD),
the  executing  agency   for   the   Technical   Assistance,  terminated  the
consultant's contract in January 1988 due to his poor performance. A new
consultant was engaged by UNDP in August 1988 to complete the assignment by
August 1989. Possible funding for the renovation program necessary to reduce
system wide technical losses would be considered under the proposed Power
Distribution and Rehabilitation project tentatively scheduled for processing
in FY90.
2.17     Under the  ESAC,  GOB  and  BPDB  agreed  to  implement a short-term
program to reduce non-technical system losses. In February 1988 this program
was revised and expanded in consultation with ADB and ODA. The revised
program  (Annex  2.11)  included:    (i) establishment  of  a  separate  loss
monitoring unit within BPDB headed by a General Manager; (ii) adequate
staffing of BPDB's commercial operations; (iii) incentives to BPDB's staff to



-12-
control  losses;  (iv) magistrate   and   police   assistance   for  BPDB  in
apprehending people stealing electricity; (v) replacing consumer-installed
high and low voltage consumers meters with new BPDB meters; (vi) calibration
of meters for other categories of consumers; and (vii) adequate sealing of
all meters.    BPDB  has  been  implementing  the  program  consistently, has
completed the replacement of meters substantially and has reduced losses on a
three months average basis from 43.4? during November 1987 - July 1988 to
34.4?  during  November  1988-January  1989.        GOB/BPDB  have  agreed  that
completion of ongoing programme to install about 1,400 high voltage meters
and about 25,000 low voltage industrial meters would be conditions of credit
effectiveness (para. 6.03(a)). BPDB has also agreed that it would prepare
and provide to IDA by August 31, 1989 a long-term programs to reduce non-
technical losses; and technical losses in BPDB's remaining distribution
system, taking into consideration UNDP funded consultants' recommendations.
Thereafter it would carry out the programs as agreed with IDA (para.
6.02(a)).
2.18     Whereas the reduction of  technical  losses  may release some system
capacity, more efficient and reliable system conditions resulting from the
reduction of technical losses will induce consumers to run their plant at
higher capacity, thus increasing the system demand. However, the reduction
of  non-technical  losses  would   decrease   demand  because  of  consumers'
reluctance to pay for all of the consumption which was earlier treated as
non-tectiucal loss. It is expected that the combination of these factors
will lower the growth rate in gross generation (GWh) during FY88-95 to 11.7?
compared to the sales growth rate of 15.9? (para 5.02).
III. THE PROJECT
A.  Project Background
3.01     BPDB's  distribution  system  is  inefficient,  with  high losses,
inadequate voltage  levels  and  high  outage  rates.   Distribution system
planning has focused on expansion  to  meet  load growth and neglected cost
reduction through  the  minimization  of  technical  losses.   The proposed
Project would address this problem and also improve the distribution
system's efficiency and reliability (para. 2.11).
3.02     BPDB plans to improve distribution systems of all its major towns.
Under financing by ADB, ODA, IDA and the Government of France, BPDB has
completed the initial phase of distribution expansion for the metropolitan
towns and suburbs of Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong and Rajshahi. It is now
expanding the distribution systems in another 18 towns with funding from
ADB and in 14 towns under IDA Credit (1648-BD). The proposed Project is an
extension of this effort to a further 16 towns, including 13 district
headquarters and three upazila municipalities (para. 2.11). All 16 towns
are administratively important, and three are close to Dhaka where
industrial expansion  is  expected.    With  the  expansion of distribution
systems in another 9 towns under the proposed Power Distribution and
Rehabilitation Project (FY90) and with the  completion of the next phase of
system expansion of Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong and Rajshahi including their
suburb towns, BPDB would complete its distribution improvement plans.



-13-
3.03     Following a preliminary survey BPDB  prepared a project report for
each of the 16 locations. This report provides the basis for the propose4
Project. IDA verified the data, load forecast and bills of material, and
amendments were made wherever necessary.

E.  Project Financing
3.07     The proposed Credit would  finance  10OZ  of the Project's foreign
costs and 57Z of local cost, equivalent to 862 of total cost excluding
taxes,  duties,   BPDB's   administrative   costs,   land  acquisition  and
development  costs  and  interest   during   construction  (IDC).    BPDB's
accounting policy provides for capitalizing interest during construction,
which is estimated to be US$10.9  million.   GOB would provide 402 of local
cost, excluding IDC and IDA's contribution, as loan at current lending rate
and the remaining local costs would be financed by BPDB from internally
generated cash, and by GOB  through  equity.          BPDB would bear both the
foreign exchange and  cost  overrun  risks.    The  financing plan includes
US$8.5 million (10? of the proposed Credit amount) for retroactive
financing of 33-kV capacitors, reactive compensation equipment and spare
parts (para. 3.11).

3.08     GOB has agreed to onlend  the  proceeds  of the proposed Credit to
BPDB under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA.  The conclusion of  this  agreement  would be a condition of Credit
effectiveness (para. 6.03(b)).    The  onlending  terms  would  be 20 years
(including 5 years of grace) at an interest rate of 7.65? per annum.
F. Project Engineering and Status of Preparation
3.09     The distribution system design would optimize system losses.   The
primary 33 and 11-kV distribution system has been designed up to FY98.
However, the secondary system (consumer services etc.,) has been provided
to meet the load  forecast  up  to  FY95.    The  system design would be in
conformity with internationally recognized criteria, which IDA has reviewed
and found acceptable (Annex 3.3).
3.10     To avoid delays in the  procurement  of material BPDB has packaged
works and equipment appropriately and sent IDA draft bid documents for:
(i) supply, delivery and erection of 33/11-kV substations, (ii) supply and
delivery of distribution equipment and materials, (iii) supply and delivery



-17-
of poles and fittings, (iv) supply and delivery of vehicles and erection
equipment, (v) supply and delivery of radio equipment, (vi) supply and
delivery of tools and testing instruments, (vii) supply and delivery of
l1-kV shunt capacitors, (viii) supply  and  delivery of meters and metering
equipment, (ix) supply, delivery, commissioning of 25 desk top computers
including the famil'-arization and training of BPDB officials in use of
software and (x) transport, erection and commissioning of distribution
substations and lines. BPDB has already invited bids for all major works
and  materials.    The  bids  for  the  remaining  items  (poles,  desk top
computers, spare parts) are expected to be issued by end 1989.
3.11     At GOB/BPDB's request, IDA has agreed to the retroactive financing
of 125 Megavar 33-kV capacitors and compensation equipment urgently
required to  improve  the  system  voltage.    BPDB's  bid  evaluations and
recommendations for the equipment have been agreed to by IDA. GOB/BPDB's
request for the retroactive financing of urgently required spare parts has
also been agreed (para. 3.07).    The total retroactive financing of US$8.5
million represents 9.82 of the Credit.
3.12     BPDB plans to use local consulting firms for detailed engineering,
bid evaluation and supervision during construction and the proposed Project
includes 900 man months of such  services.   BPDB forwarded a list of local
firms to IDA, and the eligibility of 13 out of 21 recommended by BPDB has
been  approved.    BPDB  has  issued   letters  of  invitation  to  the  13
consultants. The appointment of consultants satisfactory to IDA, would be
a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.03 (c)).
3.13     BPDB   will   prepare    without    consulting   assistance,   the
specifications and bid documents for spare parts for generating plants,
high voltage substations and the transmission system.
G. Project Implementation
3.14     The  33/11-kV  substations  and   33-kV  capacitors  and  reactive
compensation equipment  would  be  erected  on  a  turnkey  basis  to avoid
unnecessary coordination  between  various  contractors.    All low-voltage
distribution works and civil works except for substations would be erected
with the assistance of contractors engaged under Local Competitive Bidding
(LCB) procedures. These procedures have been reviewed by IDA and found to
be satisfactory. The use of contractors under LCB procedures is acceptable
to IDA since the works are scattered over a large area and are labor
intensive. Local contractors' performance in previous projects has been
satisfactory.   BPDB  would  install  meters  procured  under  the proposed
Project.   Manufacturers'  experts  erngaged  under  the  spare parts supply
contracts will supervise the installation and commissioning of inportant
spare parts to ensure satisfactory performance during warranty per,ods.
3.15     BPDB has appointed a Project  Coordinator.  The organization chart
for BPDB's implementation unit and the proposed Project's implementation
schedule are given in Annexes 3.4 and 3.5. BPDB proposes to establish four
divisions, each headed by an Executive Engineer, to implement the Project.
BPDB has agreed to establish, by September 30, 1989 and thereafter maintain
these four divisions to complete the project (para 6.02(b)). GOB approved
the Preliminary Project Proforma (PPP) on January 19, 1988. Approval of



-18-
the Project Proforma (PP) by the Executive Committee of the National
Economic Council (ECNEC) would be a condition of Credit effectiveness
(para. 6.03(d)).
H. Procurement
3.16     Procurement of  the  proposed  Project's  components  would  be in
accord  with  Bank  Procurement   Guidelines,   as   shown  in  Table  3.3.
Procurement  of  materials  and  equipment   would   be  on  the  basis  of
international competitive bidding (ICB), except for some small quantities
of materials, tools, and equipment which would be procured under limited
international bidding (LIB) and LCB, with procurement under each basis
limited to US$75,000 per contract and US$500,000 in aggregate. For ICB
items, a local manufacturer would be given a 15Z price preference on cost,
insurance and freight (CIF) prices or prevailing duties, whichever is
lower.    BPDB  has  identified   proprietary  spare  parts  costing  abcat
US$800,000 which will have to be contracted directly. IDA has reviewed
this list and  agreed  to  this  method  of  procurement.    There would be
separate packages for 33/11-kV substations, distribution equipment and
materials (conductors, hardware, insulators, distribution substations, and
consumer service materials etc.), poles and fittings, vehicles and erection
equipment, radio equipment, shunt capacitors, desk-top computers, and
meters. Spare parts, tools, and testing instruments other than proprietary
items will be procured on ICB basis.   The contractors for the transport of
materials, the erection of works and for civil works would be selected on
LCB basis.
3.17     All IDA-financed contracts  exceeding  US$250,000 would be subject
to IDA's prior review. This would cover about 802 of procurement financed
under the proposed Credit.

I. Disbursement
3,18     Disbursement under the proposed Credit would be made as follows:
(a) 100? of foreign expenditure of 33/11-kV substations, distribution
equipment and materials, poles and fittings, vehicles, erection
equipment, radio equipment, shunt capacitors, desk-top computers,
meters, compensation equipment, spare parts, tools and testing
instruments. In the case of goods manufactured locally, 100Z of
ex-factory cost, and in the case of other goods procured locally,
75Z of the cost;
(b) 10O of foreign expenditure and 75? of the local expenditure for
civil  works  and   transport,   erection   and  commissioning  of
equipment; and
(c) 100X of total expenditure for consulting services.
In order to facilitate disbursement, a special account would be established
in the Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank) on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA. The initial deposit in the account would be US$3.0 million. All
disbursements  would   be   made   following   standard  Bank  documentation
requirements, except for contracts valued at less than US$250,000 equivalent
per contract for which Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would be
used. Detailed documentation supporting SOEs would be retained at the
project coordinator's office in Dhaka.
3.19     The disbursement  schedule  shown  in  Annex  3.6  is  based on the
completion of the proposed Project by December 31, 1994, with a Credit
closing date of June 30, 1995.    The schedule also provides for retroactive
financing (para. 3.11). The total disbursement period for the project is
therefore ixpected to be 6-1/2 years, compared tL the 8 year Bank-wide
profile. The projected implementation and disbursement periods cannot be
compared meaningfully for the entire implementation period with standard
IDAJIBRD profilee for the following reasons: (i) the Project includes only
distribution works while the standard Regional profile is based only on
transmission works and the Bank-wide profile is baied on a combination of
transmission and distribution works; (ii) all of the Project towns are
already electrified; (iii) procurement would be made through contracts
runntng in parallel; and (iv) no construction would occur using force
account. However, the Bank-wide profile, which includes both transmission
and distribution works and has a total duration of 8 years, has been used
for the proposed  Froject's  first  six  years.   The remaining disbursement
after this period, expected to be about 8?, would be completed in about six'
months, mainly to pay the contractors' retention moneys. In Bangladesh the
power utilities' performance in project execution has been better than that
of utilities in other  sectors.    For  example,  the Ashuganj Power Project
(Credit 1254-BD) has recently been completed by BPDB about 12 months ahead
of credit  closing  date.    The  proposed  implementation  and disbursement
schedules are therefore considered to be realistic.



-21-
J. Development Im2act
3.20     Environment.  The expansion of the local distribution systems would
serve major towns and the lines and substations would be constructed
adjacent to public roadways. They would have a similar visual impact to the
existing lines and would  not  have  any additional adve-se environmental or
ecological effects.
3.21     Poverty Alleviation.  The  Project  w uld  reduce BPDB's demands on
the Budget and would thus make more funds available for welfare programs.
It would also provide employment to the local labor force for erecting the
distribution works and would thus assist in poverty alleviation.
3.22     Women in Development.  The nature of the Project is such that there
would not be any significant impact on the role of women in economic
development.
K. Project Monitoring
3.23     Implementation of the proposed  Project  would be monitored by BPDB
with the assistance of consultants, and BPDB would submit quarterly progress
reports  and  other  pertinent  information   to  IDA.    Following  Project
completion (i.e. not later than six months after the Credit closing date or
such later date as may be agreed for this purpose), BPDB would undertake to
prepare and furnish to IDA a Project Completion Report of such scope and in
such detail as IDA shall reasonably request, on the execution and initial
operation of the Project, its costs and the benefits derived from it, the
performance of BPDB and the accomplishment of the Credit's objectives.
L. Risks
3.24     Risks.  The  principal  risks  concern  possible  delays in project
implementation, both in procurement and during construction. To minimize
procurement  risks,  bids  for  all   major  contracts  and  proposals  from
consultants have already  been  invited.    The  risk of construction delays
because of domestic financial resource constraints would be reduced through
implementation of measures to enhance BPDB's cost recovery, including
reducing sy3tem losses and increasing its revenues. Possible construction
delays would also be minimized by ensuring effective management of project
engineering and supervision by the formation of four new construction
divisions by September 30, 1989.

IV. FINANCE
A. Financial Management
4.01     Introduction.  BPDB's  financial  objectives  are  to operate along
commercial lines by ensuring that the revenues generated from electricity
sales  are  sufficient   to   cover   total  operating  expenses,  including
depreciation, debt service and a reasonable portion of its annual capital
investment costs. Additionally, BPDB is required to maintain satisfactory
commercial accounts and have them annually audited by independent auditors
(para. 4.14). Although BPDB has undertaken various remedial measures to
3:aprove financial reporting and control and has engaged consultants to help
introduce accounting reforms in consultation with IDA and other donors, the
overall progress in establishing an efficient and reliable commercial
accounting system has been slow.   BPDB's auditors for FY87, and in previous
years, have cited a number of significant shortcomings in its accounting
procedures, such that an accurate picture of BPDB's financial position is
not available.    However,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  correction of these
deficiencies would aiter the present view Laat BPDB's past financial
performance has been unsatisfactory and that a greater commitment to the
implementation of accounting reforms is required.
4.02     In recognition of its  financial  shortcomings, BPDB is introducing
further measures to improve record keeping and specific programs to
strengthen financial viability, particularly through reductions in system
losses, greater control over accounts receivable and better operating
efficiency through system rehabilitation work. BPDB's financial projections
indicate that, if it implements the needed reforms it should be able to
gradually improve its performance from an estimated rate of return on
revalued assets of 2Z in FY89 to a satisfactory 8Z in FY93 and in each
fiscal  year  thereafter   (para. 4.24).        Details  of  BPDB's  financial
organization and past and projected financial performance are given in the
following paragraphs.
4.03     Financial Organization.  The  hember  of Finance is responsible for
the Directorates of Finance, Accounts, Audit, Purchasing, and Commercial
Operations, which are respectively accountable for (i) developing the annual
revenue budget, as well as banking, insurance, loans, and coordinating the
annual development and operating budgets; (ii) preparing accounts and
channelling disbursements through the 25 regional accounts offices (RAO) to
259 electricity supply units (ESU); (iii) carrying out an internal audit of
all BPDB financial matters; (iv) monitoring the procurement process; and
(v) billing, collecting and generally maintaining consumer accounts. BPDB,
like most public entities in Bangladesh, has insufficient adequately trained
accounting and financial staff.   In  fact, apart from the Member (Finance),
it  has  only  one  other   professionally   qualified  accountant.    As  a
consequence, established procedures are not adhered to, and there is
inadequate coordination among BPDB's operating departments, particularly in
commercial operations, thus impeding the timely preparation of meaningful
accounts, budgets and development plans. The upshot is poor cash management
and a lack of appropriate timely information for management decision-making.
Due to these deficiencies, BPDB is unable to establish the usual financial
management criteria to judge its performance and take timely corrective



-23-
action. which has contributed to its past inability to achieve satisfactory
financial performance. These institutional deficiencies in accounting and
financial management have been addressed through agreement with GOB/BPDB to
implement a specific, phased program of comprehensive institutional reforms
within BPDB (para. 2.04).
4.04     Accounts.  BPDB's accounts  are  based on double entry book-keeping
entries prepared at the ESU level and consolidated by the RAOs for
submission to the Directorate of Accounts on a monthly basis. While this
system provides a general indication of BPDB's accounts, it does not
consistently yield a clear, timely picture of its financial situation due to
deficiencies in the quality, quantity and timeliness of accounting data
reported from the  RAOs.    Although  ADB-funded consultants completed their
basic tasks to assist in the introduction of new accounts, provision of
manuals, books of accounts and implementation of organizational changes
required for an improved commercial accounting system, BPDB has made only
limited progress in the full implementation of the recommended changes.
Upon conclusion of the consultants' work, BPDB created 25 RAOs, placed all
financial and commercial functions under the Member (Finance), established
the office of General Manager of Commercial Operations (GMCO) and improved
some financial procedures. The GMCO, who is responsible for overseeing the
commercial activities of 18 major ESUs, corresponding to about Tk 4.4
billion (80Z) of sales revenue billed in FY87, has been particularly
effective in trying to improve the quality of revenue accounting data;
however, his efforts, combined with those of the Member of Distribution, who
oversees the remaining 241 ESUs, are still short of having the needed impact
on the overall quality and timeliness of BPDB's accounts.
4.05     The major remaining  accounting  deficiencies  of  BPDB  are in the
areas of revenue and accounts receivable accounting, stores and fixed assets
accounting, debt service liability accounting and account reconciliation.
At present, BPDB is implementing further accounting reforms, but a shortage
of senior professional staff is limiting progress. In order to accelerate
the reform process, BPDB and the Government have agreed to take immediate
steps to create 22 senior accountants posts and to recruit qualified
Chartered or Cost  and  Management  Accountants.    The primary functions of
these accountants will be to run the larger regional accounting offices and
strengthen headquarters accounting staff to improve reconciliation of
accounts and to implement stores  accounting.   BPDB has already interviewed
and selected eight accountants of which five have taken up their posts.
BPDB has agreed to advertise the remaining vacant posts on a quarterly basis
until all the posts are filled (para. 6.02(c)).
4.06     Billings, Collections and  Accounts  Receivable.   At present, BPDB
issues monthly bills  to  all  consumers.    The  billing procedure has been
automated for all large industrial consumers, about 50? of the residential
consumers in Dhaka, and for 400 high-tension conrumers in Chittagong via
computer-based systems, located at the Bangladesh University of Engineering
and Technology in Dhaka. Under ADB's Sixth Power Project, BPDB is acquiring
in-house  computer  facilities  for   fuller  computerization  of  billings,
including bank reconciliation for the Dhaka ESU and the implementation of an
effective financial information system with interface between the finance
and commercial  functions.    BPDB  recognizes  it  is  essential to improve
commercial and overall accounting at all levels and it now plans to provide



-24-
desk-top computers at its 25 RAOs, particularly to improve the efficiency of
billings  for  consumers  outside   Dhaka   and  for  distribution  planning
(Annex 2.2). The provision of this equipment under the proposed Project
would require adequate levels of staffing and training of the users
(paras. 2.06 and 4.03).
4.07     Under ESAC it was agreed  that  the  BPDB would reduce the level of
its accounts receivable, (i) to 4.5 months of the average billing of the
three preceding months as a condition for ESAC Board presentation; and
(ii) to  4.0  months  as  condition  of  ESAC  credit  effectiveness.   BPDB
succeeded in reducing the outstanding amount of accounts receivable from
about 5.3 months as of January 31, 1988 to about 4.4 months as of
January 31, 1989. This was possible by a combination of measures including:
improved cash collection efforts; making adjustments following a partial
aging analysis of receivables carried out at the request of IDA and ADB;
adjusting for payments made by the consumers but not transferred by the
banks to BPDB; and the writing-off of some old accounts.
4.08     GOB/BPDB have decided  on  further  measures  to reduce receivables
owed by both government and private entities. Government arrears amounted
to about Tk 1.4 billion at the end of January 1989 and accounted for about
422 of BPDB's  total  receivables.    In  order  to  reduce this amount, GOB
allocated FY89 budget funds to government departments to make immediate
payments to BPDB. In October 1988, BPDB with the approval of GOB, offered
an incentive plan to the  private  sector consumers to settle their arrears,
which amounted to about Tk 2.0 billion at January 31, 1989.  Under the plan,
penalties and interest on overdue amounts would be waived for consumers who
pay 5OZ of their past dues by  January 1, 1989 and the remaining 50Z in four
equal  monthly  instalments.    Although  the  exact  amount  of receivables
recovered under the plan is not yet knc.wn, BPDB expects to reduce the
arrears substantially through this incentive plan.
4.09     BPDB has substantially completed  the  aging analysis (para. 4.07).
Aging analysis of all the high tension consumers (about 2000) which account
for about 522 of energy sold has been completed. The results were reviewed
by IDA and found satisfactory. BPDB has agreeo to (i) complete by April 30,
1989 an aging analysis of about 48,000 lov tension industrial consumers
which account for about 132 of energy sales; ard (ii) by June 30, 1990 an
aging analysis of about 950,000 domestic and commercial consumers which
account for about 352 of energy sales and provide the results to IDA. After
completing the aging of these accounts, BPDB would maintain the said
accounts on a quarterly basis thereafter (para. 6.02(d)).
4.10     Further, BPDB has agreed  that (i) BPDB's accounts receivable would
be no more than 3.5 months of the average billing of the three preceding
months by June 30, 1989 and in each fiscal year thereafter (para. 6.02(e)).
4.11     Tariffs.  During the 1980s a  number of important changes have been
made to BPDB's tariffs:   average tariff levels were increased substantially
to meet financial objectives; the tariff structure was simplified by
reducing the number of consumer categories; and tariffs were restructured to
reflect more accurately the economic costs of supplying different consumer
groups (para. 1.12). A summary of BPDB's FY89 tariff rates is provided in
Annex 4.1.



-25-
4.12     During FY81-88 power tariffs  were  increased annually, on average,
by 14.42. Effective August 1, 1987, the average tariff rate was increased
by about 182 to  Tk  1.96/kWh.    Further,  effective  July 1, 1988 the fuel
adjustment charge was activated to increase all energy rates in the tariff
by Tk 0.05/kWh to reflect the July 1, 1988 increased price of gas to BPDB
(para. 1.12). Despite these increases, only 82 of BPDB's investment program
was financed from internal sources during FY81-88, and its rate of return on
revalued assets varied from -7.82  to  6.5Z.   Meeting BPDB's agreed rate of
return targets requires the implementation of measures to increase revenues
and reduce costs.
4.13     Although the FY88 tariff restructuring  greatly improved the way in
which electricity prices signal to electricity consumers the costs to
Bangladesh of meeting their consumption requirements, there remain major
deficiencies in the tariff structure. In particular, the sizes of the first
two subsidized blocks in the residential tariff are too large. Under the
ESAC, GOB has agreed to restructure the tariffs further.
4.14     Audit.  BPDB's  internal  audit  unit  consists  of 30 officers and
staff an." is headed by a director who reports to the Member (Finance). The
external audit is carried out by firms of independent auditors which are
normally changed about  every  three  years.    Although provision of BPDB's
audit reports to IDA has generally been on time or shortly after the agreed
nine-month period after the end of the fiscal year, the efforts of the
internal auditors and external auditors have been hampered by BPDB's poor
record  keeping  practices  and  slow   progress  in  fully  implementing  a
commercial accounting system.    While  the  auditors have noted significant
qualifications in their audit reports relating to shortcomings in BPDB's
accounting procedures, the situation has improved since the period FY75-80
during which the auditors were unable to form an opinion on BPDB's financial
statements  due  to  insufficient  data.    The  further  implementation  of
accounting reforms is expected to facilitate the preparation of better audit
reports with  fewer  qualifications.    BPDB  has  agreed  to  submit to IDA
certified copies of its audited financial statements, audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA, within nine months of the end of each fiscal
year (para. 6.02(f)).
B. Past Financial Performance
4.15     BPDB's financial performance was  assessed  on the basis of audited
financial statements covering the  period  FY83  to  FY87.   Table 4.1 below

a/ BPDB is not liable for income tax due to its status as a government agency.
4.16     BPDB's operations expanded rapidly  during  the  1980s.  From FY83
through FY87 BPDB increased total generation by an average of 13Z per annum
from 3,433 GWh to  5,587  GWh.    With  the  commissioning of new gas-fired
generating plants, investments in the transmission and distribution system,
and installation of the East-West Interconnector, BPDB's average net fixed
assets (revalued) in operation grew by almost four times from about Tk 8.7
billion to about Tk 31.9 billion during the same period. Although tariffs
were increased by an average of 122 per annum from Tk 1.00/kWh in FY82 to
Tk 1.73/kWh in FY87, BPDB was unable to achieve satisfactory financial
performance principally due to a combination of operating inefficiencies,
including high system losses, excessive operations and maintenance costs
and high fuel expenses. Consequently, BPDB could not comply with the self-
financing targets of 202 (FY83) and 252 (FY84 and FY85) agreed with IDA
under Credit 1254-BD or with the rate of return targets of 5.0 (FY86),
7.52 (FY87) and 8.52 (FY88) agreed with IDA under Credit 1648-BD. To meet
the agreed rate of return of 92 in FY89 BPDB would have needed to increase
tariffs by 402, which, overall, would not be politically acceptable.
4.17     After  ten  years  of  poor  financial  performance  and operating
losses, BPDB became temporarily profitable  during  FY83 to FY85.  This was
d.e to  (i)  tariff  increases  which  caused  average  revenue  per kWh to
increase by 282 in FY83, 12 in  FY84  and  a further 9X in FY85; and (ii) a
temporary reduction in average total fuel costs resulting from the
energization at 132-kV of the first East-West Interconnector (designed for
230-kV) in December 1982 (para. 2.07). After experiencing negative returns
in previous years, BPDB's rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation (revalued) was 6.5Z in FY83.    However, it subsequently declined



-27-
to 5.2Z in FY84, 2.52 in FY85, O.O in FY86 and was 1.7Z in FY87. The
decline in performance during FY85 was principally due to an increase in
system losses to over 37Z in that year from 32X in FY84. Although system
losses came down to 312 in FY86 before rising again to 382 in FY87, BPDB's
operating ratio (operating expenses/operating revenue) increased from about
832 during FY83 and FY84, to 90Z in FY85 and was 10OZ in FY86 before
falling to 912 in FY87.
4.18     BPDB's expenses increased  faster  than  revenues  during FY84 and
FY85 because of higher than expected operations and maintenance expenses
and fuel costs associated with a greater than anticipated reliance on
poorly  performing  oil-fired   generating   plants   in   the  west  zone.
Deficiencies in these plants would be addressed under the proposed Power
Distribution and Rehabilitation Project.    Furthermore, to reduce its fuel
costs, BPDB needs to ensure that the East-West Interconnector is upgraded
from 132-kV to 230-kV by September 1989, as now planned. Although the
average tariff rate increased by 242 during FY86 and FY87 and fuel costs
were reduced in FY87, the benefit on the revenue side was mitigated by the
increase in system  losses  to  38%  in  FY87.    The  net  effect of these
occurrences was a deterioration in the operating ratio to 912 in the same
year.  While  fuel  costs  actually  dropped  in  FY87  by  202  due to the
commissioning of major gas-fired thermal generation units at Ghorasal and
Ashuganj, there was a corresponding increase in BPDB's asset base of 352.
As a consequence, the improvement in operating income from Tk 1 million in
FY86 to Tk 556 million in FY87 was offset by growth in the asset base and
the rate of return improved only marginally.
4.19     BPDB's  ratio  of  current   assets  to  current  liabilities  was
generally in a  satisfactory  range  during  the  period  under review, but
showed a declining trend from 1.8 in FY83 to 0.7 in FY87. However, BPDB
carried excessive amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable
during the period. Actions are being Laken to reduce accounts receivable
(paras. 4.07-4.10). Delays in paying for fuel, account for BPDB's largest
accounts payable and these are being settled with the Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation under a plan which calls for BPDB to pay off the arrears at the
rate of Tk 50 million per  month.    BPDB's  practice of deferring payments
for fuel has enabled it to finance a higher proportion of its investments.
than if payments had been made on schedule.
4.20     In  late  FY88  IDA  learned  that  the  Government  had  not been
implementing the subsidiary loan agreements' onlending terms and conditions
for commercial entities  (including  energy  sector entities) under ongoing
IDA credits, ADB loans and loans from various bilateral donors. For IDA
credits, Government has required BPDB to make interest payments and
repayments of principal on the same terms as the Government repayments to
IDA, rather than in accordance with the subsidiary loan agreements. It is
estimated that total accumulated arrears of energy sector entities under
IDA credits, as of June 30, 1988 was about US$87 million equivalent,
including about US$23 million pertaining to BPDB. With IDA's agreement,
the Government has adopted the following action plan to address this issue
for  IDA  credits.    Beginning  with  its  FY89  accounts,  BPDB  has been
instructed to record in its financial statements payments of interest and
principal in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subsidiary
loan agreements, and would be in compliance with the subsidiary loan



-28-
agreements. GOB agreed that all BPDB's arrears as of June 30, 1988 vill be
converted into equity and GOB will implement this decision by June 30, 1989
(para. (6.01(c)). Further, compliance with the terms and conditions of the
subsidiary loan agreements will be monitored closely by the supervision
missions.

4.22      BPDB's generation of  electricity  is  expected  to increase at an
average annual rate of 122 from 5.587 GWh in FY87 to 14,177 GWh in FY95.
As a result of the efforts being undertaken to reduce both technical and
non-technical system losses (paras. 2.13-2.18), BPDB's overall losses are
expected to decline from about 382 in FY87 to 302 in FY90 and to 242 by
FY95. This projected efficiency improvement would Pnable BPDB to increase
its revenues from electricity sales by an average annual rate of 27Z, from
about Tk 6.0 billion in FY87 to about Tk 40.3 billion in FY95.
4.23      BPDB  is  undertaking  new  investments  and  implementing various
measures to strengthen its  capacity  to  provide an efficient and reliable
supply of power  and  improve  its  financial  performance.   As previously
noted, implementation of various actions should reduce system losses
significantly. In addition, new gas-fired plants using indigenous gas in
the east zone are displacing less efficient plants using costly imported



-29-
fuels in the  west  zone.    For  example,  new  gas  generation units were
commissioned in the east zone in FY87 and FY88 at Ghorasal (210 MW),
Ashuganj (2 x 150 MW), and Siddhirganj (100 MW) and two additional hydro
units (2 x 50 MW) at Karnafuly.    Another gas generating unit (1 x 150 MW)
was commissioned at Ashuganj in FY89.   With the upgrading of the East-West
transmission line interconnector from 132-kV to 230-kV in September 1989,
consumers in the west zone will be less dependent on thermal units using
imported oil  in  the  west  zone  (Khulna,  Bheramara,  etc.).   Under the
proposed Power Distribution and Rehabilitation Project the thermal plants
in the west zone would be rehabilitated to restore their efficiency.
Improvements in the transmission and distribution system are being funded
by previous and ongoing ADB loans and IDA credits.
4.24     In addition to improving its operating efficiency, BPDB also plars
to increase and restructure its tariff rates (para. 4.12). However, it is
not considered feasible within the next two to three years for BPDB to
comply with the existing rate of return targets agreed under Credit 1648-BD
(para. 4.16)  or   achieve   satisfactory   financial  performance  without
unrealistically high tariff increases.    IDA  has agreed to GOB/BPDB's new
set of financial targets which would allow for the impact of efficiency
improvements and reductions in system losses to be realized and which would
require moderate real increases in  tariff  rates.   Based on the financial
projections agreed with IDA, BPDB would need to implement tariff increases
averaging about lZ per annum from FY89 through FY95 in order to achieve a
satisfactory rate of return of 82 in FY93 and thereafter, on average net
revalued fixed assets in operation.    To allow for the gradual improvement
of BPDB's financial performance, BPDB has agreed to take all necessary
measures including restructuring and increasing of tariffs to enable BPDB
to meet rate of return on revalued assets of 22 in FY89, 42 in FY90, 6Z in
FY91, 7Z in FY92, 82 in FY93 and in each fiscal year thereafter
(para. 6.02(g)). Before April 1 of each fiscal year BPDB would furnish to
IDA the results of its review to determine the steps required to meet the
target in that year and next fiscal year.
4.25     Achievement of the proposed  rate  of  return targets would enable
BPDB to cover all of its operating expenses, maintain a debt service ratio
of between 1.1 and 2.3 and finance about 242 of its expected investment
program for the period FY89  to  FY95.   The financial projections indicate
that BPDB's debt equity ratio would range between 45/55 and 58/42 and its
current ratio and working capital position would be satisfactory.

4.27     During FY89-95, BPDB is  expected  to  generate  net cash equal to
about 242 of its financing  requirements.   As BPDB's financial performance
improves, its ability to finance future investments would also improve.
Between FY89-95, BPDB's internally generated funds are ei.pected to increase
from 192 to 39Z  of  annual  investment  costs.   GOB's contribution during
FY89-95 is expected to be about 242 of BPDB's requirements with 102
provided as equity contribution and 14Z as long-term loans. Consumer
deposits and employee contributions would provide another 2Z. Foreign
funds estimated at the equivalent of Tk 59.8 billion would account for
about 51Z of BPDB's financing needs.   The proposed project, is expected to
comprise about 3? of BPDB's financing requirement during the period of
project execution.   It  is  recognized  that  the  size  of the investuent
program would need to be reduced if, due to budget constraints, GOB is
unable to  contribute  funds  ar  projected  in  the  financing  plan.   No
difficulties are anticipated in securing the foreign funds necessary to
implement the program.
E. Insurance
4.28     As agreed under Cr.1648-BD, BPDB  has  established a fund from its
own resources to cover its insurance risks satisfactory to IDA. BPDB has
agreed to continue the same arrangements under the proposed project
(para. 6.02(h)).
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Electricity Demand Forecast
5.01     The demand forecast  for  FY89-05  was  prepared using a two-stage
approach. For FY89-95 it was based on projections of the growth in the
number of consumers in each category and consumption per consumer derived
from analysis of past sales to each consumer group. The projected number
of new connections each year was compared to the number of consumers on
BPDB's lists  who  have  requested  electricity  supply.    For FY96-05 the
forecast  was  made  using  a  macroeconomic  model  which  correlated past
sectoral sales of electricity to GDP growth rates in those sectors and
sectoral projections of future GDP growth rates.
5.02     The demand  (HW)  and  energy  (GWh)  forecasts  are  presented in
Annexes 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, while past developments are shown in
Annex 2.7. Total electricity sales increased at about 13.8Z a year during
FY8O-87, with the highest growth rate being for sales to residential
cons-umers, 18.91 a year. It is estimated that total sales will increase at
about 15.9? a  year  during  FY88-95  (Table  5.1).    The  reasons for the
relatively high projected growth rate include: improved reliability and
quality of supply through the proposed Project; increased connections of
new consumers, partly through the improvement of the distribution systems
in 32 major towns (para. 3.02); and also the projected increase in
industrial activity. It is anticipated that due to the restructuring of
tariffs (para. 1.12), the annual growth rate of sales to residential
consumers would fall to 18.4? during FY88-95. However, the yearly growth
rate of sales to industrial consumers is projected to increase from 7? to



-32-
14.0Z. The annual growth rate of gross generation is forecast to decline
from 13.2? in FY80-87 to 11.7Z during FY88-95 (Annex 2.4) because of the
reduction in technical losses and improvement in system voltage conditions.
The maximum peak demand during the same period is projected to increase by
11.32 a year, compared to about 13.0 during FY80-87. This reduced growth
rate results from the reduction of power system technical losses and load
management measures which will improve the average load factor and thus
reduce the growth of peak demand.
5.03      The energy sales forecast for FY88-95 is given in Table 5.1 and in
detail in Annex 2.4. The detailed forecast for the 16 towns is given in
Annex 5.1. Table 5.1 shows that the growth rate for sales to industrial
consumers in the 16 project towns, 13.2? a year, is similar to the 14.0O
growth rate for BPDB as a whole. This is partly because some of the towns,
such as Brahmanbaria, Chandpur and Ishurdi, and the Dhaka suburb towns of
Gazipur, Munshiganj and Naryaganj, have large concentrations of industrial
loads. Underlying the sales forecast is a projected growth in the number
of consumers in the project towns from about 76,000 In FY88 to about
150,000 in FY95, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 10.2?.

B. Least Cost Alternative
5.04     BPDB prepared  the  proposed  Project  to  expand the distribution
systems and reduce technical losses in the 16 towns at least cost. The
assumptions used and the calculations have been reviewed by IDA and found
to be  satisfactory.    The  detailed  design,  including  the selection of
operating  voltage,  conductor  size,  location   and  size  of  33-kV  and
distribution substations, was finalized after analyzing the costs and
distribution technical losses for each alternatives and selecting the least
cost option. The alternative costs of supply from isolated diesel stations
were not analyzed since the Project involves the rehabilitation and
expansion of BPDB's existing distribution systems.
C. Economic Internal Rate of Return
5.05     Although the proposed Project  would  play  a  crucial role in the
optimal development and operation of BPDB's supply system, its net benefits
cannot be separated from those of other least-cost operations, especially
generation  and  transmission.    Therefore,  having  established  that the
Project is part of the least-cost expansion program, it is appropriate to
carry out the cz.st benefit analysis on the power subsector's entire
investment program to ensure  that  it  is  justified.   For this purpose a
'time-slice" of BPDB and REB investments and operation expenses for the
period FY88-95 was analyzed, together with the incremental sales made
possible  by  those  investments.    A  minimum  measure  of  the  benefits
associated with the inc.emental sales is given by incremental sales revenue
using the FY88 average revenue per kWh sold, together with the kWh
equivalent  average  demand  charge.        All  costs  (capital,  operating,
maintenance, etc.) and benefits were expressed in terms of their equivalent
border values.   On  this  basis,  the  adjusted  Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) is estimated to be about 52. The detailed calculations are
presented in Annex 5.2.
5.06     The above revenue based measure of  the  rate of return is more an
evaluation of the adequacy of tariffs than of the true economic worth of
the investment program (which includes the proposed Project). Since the
revenue based EIRR is less than the estimated opportunity cost of capital
of 12Z, this indicates that the average tariff rate is below the long-run
marginal cost (para 1.12).
5.07     A better measure of the economic  rate of return would be based on
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for incremental elecsricity sales. A
conservative estimate of WTP was made as follows: (i) for residential,
commercial and office consumers, it was based on the cost of lighting using
either pressurized kerosene lamps (yield equivalent to an electric bulb of
100 watt) or kerosene wick lamps (yield equivalent to a 20 watt bulb);
(ii) for industrial, irrigation and large commercial consumers it was based
on the cost of running a captive diesel plant using imported high speed
diesel oil (see Annex 5.2). For each consumer group the WTP estimates were
prepared as follows.    First,  the  electricity  sales which represented a
substitution of electricity for an alternative fuel were valued as
indicated in (i)  and  (ii)  above.    Second,  the incremental electricity
sales, which were a response  to  the  lower price of electricity vis-a-vis
its substitute were valued at one-half of the estimated WTP on the



-34-
assumption that the relevant demand curve was linear. The weighted average
WTP was estimated to be Tk 6.7/kWh, and the EIRR to be 33Z. Although this
exceeds the opportunity cost of capital it is still only a partial measure
of the true EIRR since, among other things, no allowance has been made for
consumers' WTP for the improved reliability and quality of service
(Annex 5.2).
5.08     The EIRR of the 16 Towns Project was also calculated, allowing for
their associated transmission and distribution costs. Benefits were based
on the incremental sales projected to result from the reduction of system
losses and improved quality of supply, valued at consumers' WTP calculated
as described in para. 5.07. The EIRR for the 16 towns part of the proposed
Project is about 282, and for each indt.vidual town the EIRR exceeds the
opportrnity cost of capital of 122.    These  rates are also below the true
economic rates of return since benefits related to improved quality of
supply and other factors were not taken into account (Annex 5.2).
D. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
5.09     Sensitivity analysis was carried out  for both the revenue and WTP
based measures of EIRR (pages 4 and 6 of Annex 5.2) to ascertain the likely
risk that the  proposed  Project  would  be  unecoromic.    The analysis is
presented in terms of the percentage change in a particular item required
to yield a specified EIRR value.    For  example, page 4 of Annex 5.2 shows
that either a 8.5Z increase in capital costs or an 7.3Z decrease in
benefits would reduce the EIRR from 33Z to 301. The sensitivity analysis
indicates that the base case EIRR estimates are robust.
E. Justification for Bank Group Involvement
5.10     In addition to providing additional capacity to meet forecast load
growth  at  least  cost,   the   proposed   Project  would,  through  IDA's
involvement:
(a) improve the efFicient tuse of resources by reducing power system
losses;
(b) improve system reliability and supply voltage conditions leading
to increased consumption by existing consumers and a higher system
load factor;
(c) improve the system operation by providing spare parts for its
power stations and high voltage substations and transmission
system;
(d) assist the power subsector in rationalizing its tariffs;
(e)  assist  the   power   subsector   in   implementing  institutional
improvements;
(f) expand training facilities; and
(g) improve BPDB's accounting system and distribution planning.

BANGLADESH
POWER DISTRIBUTION (16 TOWNS) PROJECT
PROCUREMENT OF DESK-TOP COMPUTERS
REGIONAL ACCOUNTING OFFICES (RAO'S)
Introduction
1.       IDA's credit for the above mentioned project provides for the
Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) to acquire 25 desk-top computers
and related software and necessary training. The objective would be to
computerize and thereby strengthen the distribution planning and billing
and accounting functions at BPDB's 25 Regional Accounting Offices (RAO's)
located throughout Bangladesh. Background information about BPDB and on
the pertinent computer and training requirements is summarized below.
Background
2.       BrDB is a statutory autonomous body created under Presidential
Order No. 59 of 1972. It is responsible for electricity generation,
transmission and distribution throughout Bangladesh except in areas covered
by the Rural Electrification Board (REB) created by the Government in 1977
to accelerate the program of rural electrification.
3.       Bangladesh is divided into east and west zones by the Ganges/Padma
and Brahmuputra/Jamuna river systems. In FY87 BPDB's total firm generating
capacity was 1457 MW comprising of 130 MW kyroelectric plant, 1015 natural
gas fired plant 4312 MW of liquid fuel fired plant. Major generating
stations and load centres are interconnected by a 2350 km of 132-kV
transmission lines and 167 km of 66-kV lines. There are about 963,000
consumers consisting of about 633,000 domestic, about 257,000 commercial,
about 20000 high voltage industrial, about 45000 low voltage industrial,
and 26000 others.
4.       BPDB's smallest administrative unit is called on Electric Supply
Unit (ESU). There are now 259 ESUs; 18 ESUs which consume about 60Z of
energy are under the General Manager Commercial and the remaining 241 are
under the Member Distribution. In order to facilitate the preparation of
BPDB's commercial accounts, 25 regional accounting offices are located
throughout Bangladesh.
5.       System losses in BPDB are very high and in May 1988 were about
39Z. In order to reduce both technical and non-technical losses, BPDB
wishes to (i) computerize all consumer billing; and (ii) make the
distribution system more efficient.
6.       BPDB has introduced limited computerized billing in Dhaka and
Chittagong areas with the assistance of University of Engineering and
Technology in Dhaka. Under Asian Development Banks' Sixth Power project it
is acquiring in house computer facilities.

equipment and a training program which would be suitable to ensure that the
RAO's would be able to computerize their distribution planning and
commercial accounting functions as follows:
(a) Distribution planning will include:
(i)   Feeder Analysis (voltage drop, fault study and loss
study);
(ii)  Data base for feecers;
(iii) Equipment Record;
(iv)  Load forecasting;
(v)   Line construction design;
Sag Tension Calculation;
Pole Design;
Guy Design; and
(vi) Single line diagram preparation.
(b) Commercial Accounting will include:
Accounting, billing, collection, working capital control
and treasury functions.
9.       The contractor would be responsible for installation of the
equipment, provision of necessary training of about 8 weeks in Bangladesh
for about 60 engineers and 100 accountants and assistance in computerizing
the distribution planning functions and commercial accounting for each RAO
as described above.

POWER DISTRIBUTION (16 TOWNS) PROJECT
Assumptions For Financial Projections
Income Statements
Revenues:
Average Rate. The average rates are calculated based on the
revised rate of return requirements of 2? for FY89, 42 for FY90, 6Z for
FY91, 72 for FY92 and 8Z for FY93-95.
Other Income. Include meter rentals, charges for connection and
disconnection, late payment fees, interest on collection, etc. These are
projected to remain at 3.52 of electricity sales.
Expenses:
Fuel Costs. This is a major expense item and represents direct
cost of fuel as used for power generation. Based on the most efficient
load dispatching concept, a plant-by-plant proiection of generation and the
associated fuel costs has been calculated.
Repair and Maintenance. These represent the cost of repair and
maintenance of power plants and are calculated as a percentage of Gross
Fixed Asnets (revalued). For projections these have been estimated at:
2.42 for FY89, 2.4Z for FY90 and 2.0Z thereafter. The higher percentage
during FY89-90 is because of additional repair and maintenance work
envisaged during the period. At preser,t intensive maintenance work is
being undertaken by BPDB on generating units which could not be shut down
earlier because of capacity shortage.
Employees Costs. These represent the direct cost of salaries and
wages paid to employees and are projected to grow at 152 per annum.
Administration. Includes office expenses, rent, etc., and is
projected to grow at 102 per annum.
Depreciation. Calculated at the rate of 3.22 on average revalued
Gross Fixed Assets. It may be noted that an adjustment of Tk 1,662 million
has been made in FY88. This adjustment was necessary because BPDB's
accounts for the historical years did not consider revaluation of
depreciation while assets were revalued.
Interest on Long-Term Loans. These include interest on: foreign
loans (at various rates specific to the project and the concomitant
Subsidiary Loan Agreements), loans from GOB (at 5? per annum) and
Debentures (at 122 per annum).



-79-                            ANNEX 4.2
Page 2 of 3
Interest on Short-Term Loans. These include interest on short-
term loans (commercial borrowing) and are charged at 14? per annum.
Prior Years Adjustment. BPDB had defaulted in repaying Its debts
to GOB as per SLA terms and conditions. It has been agreed that all such
outstanding debts as of June 30, 1988 would be converted to GOB equity
contribution and will be adequately reflected in BPDB's accounts of FY89.
Computation of BPDB's total outstanding debt as of end June'88 is not
complete as yet. However, GOB/BPDB has notified IDA that the total of such
outstanding debts on account of IDA projects was Tk 770.654 million.
During FY89, this amount has been converted to equity. This conversion has
to be updated once GOBIBPDB complete their computation and inform IDA.
Sources and Applications of Funds:
Government Equity and Loan. For the purpose of financing local
components of project costs, 60Z of all local components along with the
total cost of interest during construction has been assumed to be met from
BPDB's internal resources and GOB's equity contributions to BPDB, while the
balance of 402 is assumed to be met from GOB loans.
Consumer Contribution and Consumer Deposits (Net). A 107 growth
rate has been assumed.
Employees Fund These represent contributions from employees to
their Gratuity and Provident Funds and have been assumed to grow at 102 per
annum.
Borrowings:
Foreign Loans. The foreign component of all project costs are
assumed to be financed fully by loans. In order to cover for exchange rate
fluctuations yearly opening balances of each loans have been revalued at
5Z. While this report was being finalized, BPDB's foreign debt service
schedule for FY87 required some additional adjustments. Once these
adjustments are satisfactorily completed, the financial model will have to
be updated.
Working Capital:
Cash and Bank Balances. Assumed to be the equivalent of 1.5
months of cash expenditures.
Inventories. These include capital and operating stores and have
been projected to remain at 2.5? of Gross Fixed Assets.
Accounts Receivable. BPDB's accounts receivable in 1987 was more
than 7 months. In 1988 it is expected to improve to 5 months; for
projections from FY89 onwards these have been assumed to remain at 3.5
months of electricity sales. All calculations are based on an average of
12 months.

Other Debtors--Advance to Suppliers. Projected to grow at 102 per
annum.
Advance to Employees. Projected to grow at 102 per annum.
Prepaid Expenses. Includes insurance premiums, etc., and are
assumed to grow at 3Z per annum.
Bank Loans. These represent commercial borrowings primarily
required to meet working capital requirements. Assuming improved financial
performance for future years, these have been projected to reduce by 102
from FY90.
Accounts Payable. These comprise mainly of unpaid fuel bills.
BPDB has substantial dues owed to BPC; at the end of FY88 these are
estimated to be more than Tk 3.6 billion. A gradual reduction is envisaged
so that the present accounts payable to the oil companies could be
liquidated within a period of six years. Total accounts payable are
projected to remain at a level of 3 to 4 months of yearly fuel costs,
repairs and maintenance expenses and employees costs.
Security Deposits (Contractors). These are assumed to grow at 152
per annum.
Taxes and Duties Payable. These represent customs duties and
taxes payable by BPDB and are assumed to reduce at 10? per annum from FY88.
Other Current Liability. These include salaries due but not paid
during the year, other accured expenses etc., and are assumed to grow at 52
per year.

lt :In FT 89 BPDB's arrears of Tk.3680 million owing to BPC have been transferred from Current Liability to Long Term Debt since their repayment and elimination
frau 8P9B's accounts is expected to take about six years.  However, because this is an accounting adjustment oilty and not an actual cash reduction in BPDB's obligation
to BPC it has not been taken into account in the working capital adjustment for the purpose of calcuLating BPD0's contribution to investment in FY 89. If it were
taken into account, BPDB's contribution to construction would appear to be nil at -25.7 S.

POWER DISTRIBUTION (16 TOWNS) PROJECT
Economic Internal Rate of Return
1.       As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an integral
part of the power system plan and, therefore, cost-benefit ana'lysis needs
to be carried out on the whole plan rather than on the project in
isolation. However, for project justification it is not sufficient to
demonstrate that the EIRR on a "time-slice" of the power system investment
plan exceeds the 12X opportunity cost of capital. It is also necessary to
demonstrate that the EIRR for the 16 towns subproject, and for each
individual town, exceeds 12Z.
2.       For the "time-slice" analys1i, BPDB's and REB's investment
programs for FY88-95 were analyzed, plus an operating period up to FY2021
to cover the operating life of the longest lived generating stations to be
commissioned during FY88-95. The lives of the different types of
generating plants were assumed to be:
Gas combustion turbines units (0-30 MW)          15 years
Gas combustion turbines units (30-100 MW)        20 years
Combined cycle units                             20 years
Gas fired, steam turbine units                   25 years
Hydro units                                      50 years
Diesel units                                     15 years
All new rlants commissioned in FY88-95 were assumed to be retired at the
end of their useful lives, and not replaced. Investment costs, incremental
operation and maintenance costs, generation costs (all in terms of mid FY88
prices), and benefit streams are shown in pages 3 and 5. Assumptions
underlying these costs and benefits are detailed below.
Costs
3.       All financial costs were converted to economic costs by
(i) expressing the import content at cif prices; (ii) valuing unskilled
labor at 0.75 of the market wage rate; and (iii) applying the estimated
standard conversion factor, 0.8, to local costs.
4.       For conversion to economic costs, it was assumed that 20Z of the
investment cost of a project would be for labor and 80Z for equipment and
materials. Annual operation and maintenance (O & M) costs were assumed at
2.5Z of the capital cost for generation projects, 22 for transmission and
41 for distribution works. It was also assumed that for generation 0 & M
costs, labor would be 20Z, while for transmission and distribution projects
it would be 601.

5.       Fuel costs, estimated on an economic basis, were as follows:
natural gas Tk 19.09/MCF, high speed diesel Tk 30.5/gallon, and fuel oil
Tk 21.37/gallon. Fuel cost savings were estimated as the difference in
discounted costs of meeting projected demand using the existing supply
system vis-a-vis using the supply system which included the new generating
units to be commissioned in FY88-95. These fuel cost savings included the
savings estimated to result from the substitution of gas-fired generation
in the east zone for oil-fired generation in the west zone using the second
east-west interconnector.
Benefits
6.       Benefits for the economic rate of return calculations have been
estimated on two bases. Firstly, simply in terms of what consumers
actually pay for electricity (Tk 1.96/kWh) under the existing tariff (page
6). On this basis the EIRR is about 6Z. This adjusted EIRR (since
benefits are measured in financial rather than economic termis) says more
about the adequacy of tariffs and their relationship to LIIC than about the
true economic worth of the proposed project. The latter requires benefits
to be measured in terms of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the
incremental electricity supply.  WTP was measured by the costs of the
alternative methods of meeting consumers' demands for lighting, motive
power, etc. which are displaced by electricity, multiplied by the standard
conversion factor to put them in economic terms. On this basis the
weighted average WTP was estimated to be Tk 5.24/kWh. The EIRR on this
basis is about 34Z (page 4). This is a lower bound estimate of EIRR. It
does not measure consumers' WTP for improved quality of light, convenience
benefits of electricity supply, etc.
EIRR for 16 Towns Subproject
7.       For the EIRR for the 16 Towns subproject costs were calculated for
the period FY89-94 and benefits for the period FY94-13. Investment costs
relate to the distribution systems in the 16 towns, plus associated
transmission costs. Benefits were measured in two stages. First,
incremental sales for each consumer class (for each town) were multiplied
by WTP for each consumer class. Second, the benefits of system technical
loss reduction were measured by calculating the energy which would be saved
by reducing losses and valuing it at the long-run marginal cost of supply
associated with the "time slice" analysis, Tk 2.45/kWh.
8.       Techluical and non-technical losses were assumed to be reduced from
23.52 during FY88 to 10.25Z in FY95. About 84% of this reduction was
assumed to be converted to sales. Although there would be additional
sales, and thus benefits, related to the project, they were not estimated
because the related cost of generation and transmission required to match
the distribution costs could not be determined correctly. However, the
EIRR would increase if these additional sales were considered.
9.       Although consumers would benefit from the improved reliability of
supply in the 16 towns project, their WTP for improved reliability has not
been estimated. However, its measurement would increase the estimated
EIRRs.
