REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $95 million to
help finance a Third Highway Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 4.5 years of grace, with interest of 8.7 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975 and
its report, "The Philippines: Priorities and Prospects for Development, Basic
Economic Report" (Report No. 1095a-PH of May 5, 1976) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on May 18, 1976 (SecM/76/366). Paragraphs 3-16 below are
an updated summary of that report.   Annex 1 contains country economic data./l
3.        During the 1960s, the economy grew in real terms at an annual rate
of about 5-6 percent. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the benefits
of growth were distributed relatively unevenly. As the population and labor
force continued to grow rapidly, unemployment rose. Low levels of taxation
accentuated these problems and resulted in inadequate public investment in
necessary infrastructure and social services. A relatively weak export per-
formance combined with a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic
industry resulted in a steady deterioration in the balance of payments posi-
tion.
4.        During 1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group for the Philippines, they succeeded in
improving substantially the maturity structure of the external public debt.
Real GNP during that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972,
the Government initiated a series of social and economic reforms including
an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an administrative reorganiza-
tion.
5.        In 1973, there was a sharp increase in the level of economic
activity in the Philippines and the growth in real GNP doubled to 10 percent.
This upsurge was led by the international commodity boom, which resulted in
higher export incomes, a strong recovery in agricultural and industrial
production for the domestic market, and an expansion in public and private
investment.
/1 This is an updated version of the discussion of the economy in the
President's Reports for the Second Fisheries and Second Grain Process-
ing Projects (Report Nos. 1850-PH and 1851-PH of May 13, 1976).
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

6.        Like most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973.   With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines was quite vulnerable
to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices, and the pro-
longed recession in the industrialized countries. While adverse effects of
the recession were cushioned somewhat in 1974 by a modest improvement in the
external terms of trade, the Philippines was more seriously affected in 1975
by the continued rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine
exports.  While the international economic situation has made it difficult
for the Government to realize its objective of accelerating the rate of
development, GNP in 1974 and 1975 has, nevertheless, grown in real term:s at
an annual rate of about 6 percent and the same rate is expected in 1976.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2 per-
cent per year during the 1970s, a period which has been characterized by
unusually adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 per-
cent in 1973/74, but because of damage by typhoons, grew by only 1 percent
in 1974/75; the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half of
1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, the rice harvest in 1975/76 was
very good and during this period the Philippines was virtually self-sufEicient
in rice. The Government continues to give the highest priority to further
increasing agricultural production and has initiated a number of programs
designed to expand the use of fertilizer, irrigation and supervised credlit.
It has also intensified efforts to expand the social services needed in rural
areas, including rural electrification, health and family planning services,
and village road and small-scale irrigation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has made some progress with its agrarian reform for the nation's
one million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By May 31, 1976, the
Government had issued Certificates of Land Transfer to 216,000 of the
424,000 tenants on holdings of over 7 hectares; thus, title to 378,000
hectares of the total 825,000 hectares of farms occupied by such tenants has
been transferred. The Government has raised the cash portion of the coin-
pensation package to landlords to reduce their resistance to land reform,
but strong administrative efforts will be necessary to ensure continued
progress in the implementation of the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employment.
Industrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973, was adversely
affected in 1974 and 1975 by the worldwide economic slowdown and the depressed
demand for Philippine exports. As a result, industrial production increased
by only 4 percent in 1974 and 5 percent in 1975. Stepped-up public sector
spending for infrastructure development and other priority projects and for
the alleviation of recent flood and earthquake damages has contributed
significantly to sustaining the higher level of domestic activity in 1976,
especially in the construction industry. The longer term prospects for
industrial growth are favorable because of the natural and human resource
endowment of the Philippines and a very active private sector.

10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently over 3 percent,
having risen from 1.8 percent in FY72./1 The Government has also implemented a
series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax administration.
These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom in export
incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase in national
government tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in FY74. The
ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP has increased from an average
of 9 percent in the early 1970s to about 12 percent in FY74 and FY75.
11.       Significant financial reforms have also been enacted.    At the begin-
ning of 1976, the Central Bank issued circulars designed to help rationalize
the level and structure of deposit and lending rates; deposit rates were raised
for the second time in 18 months; long-standing statutory ceilings on the long-
term lending rates of banking institutions were increased from 12-14 percent
to 19 percent per annum; and the ceilings on short-term lending rates were
raised. Efforts were also made to control short-term money market operations
and to strengthen the organized banking institutions. These actions should
help to improve the mobilization and allocation of domestic resources in the
Philippines.
12.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines. The increase in prices was caused by the large increase
in liquidity that came with the export boom in 1973/74, and by a number of
cost-push factors, including the higher rate of world inflation. To deal
with this problem, the Government adopted contractionary monetary and fiscal
policies, and attempted to reduce the impact of inflation on consumers by
subsidizing such essential goods as wheat, imported rice, and cooking oil.
The annual inflation rate fell from 35 percent in 1974 to 8 percent in 1975,
and the authorities aim at keeping inflation below 7 percent in 1976. While
monthly inflation rates have generally been lower in 1976 than in 1975, there
have been moderate inflationary pressures in the last few months resulting
from the damages of recent typhoons to food crops, a 25 percent increase in
land transport fares, a significant though long overdue raise in the minimum
wages, and an increase in the controlled prices for rice and corn.
13.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments benefitted
considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973. High
prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products, sugar,
copper and wood products, resulted in a 70 percent increase in export earnings
and a current account surplus of about $550 million. Since mid-1974, the
external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp increases in the
prices of oil and other imports, less favorable prices for Philippine exports,
and reduced volume of some exports resulting from the downturn in the econo-
mies of the Philippines' main trading partners. As a result, current account
deficits of $240 million in 1974 and about $900 million in 1975 were incurred.
The current account deficits have been offset by direct foreign investment,
inflows of medium- and long-term loan capital, the use of IMF facilities and
/1 Fiscal year July I to June 30.

some short-term borrowing by the Central Bank. During 1976, exports have been
at a slightly lower level than 1975, because of continuing weakness in inter-
national markets and, particularly, lower sugar prices; imports have also been
smaller than last year because of relatively low rates of industrial investment
and the excellent rice crop which made rice imports unnecessary. The outlook
is for a current account deficit of about the same magnitude as in 1975, which
will be largely offset by capital inflows; the overall deficit is expected to
be about $200 million. In mid-1976, reserves stood at about $1.2 billion,
equivalent to four months' imports. Assuming continued sound debt management
and the maintenance of a reasonable maturity structure of foreign borrowings,
the overall level of external debt of the Philippines is expected to remnain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
and nonfactor services would average about 16-17 percent during the rest of
this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 17 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 percent. These
shares are expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
14.       Foreign assistance on concessional terms will be essential to
help finance the large investment expenditures which will be necessary For
the country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement of external
assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of development expendi-
tures which will be required during the latter part of the decade and that
debt service obligations remain within reasonable limits, total commitments
of official assistance will need to be maintained in real terms at least
at the annual level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The
Consultative Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on June L5
and 16, 1976, agreed that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Govern-
ment to seek official aid commitments of about $600 million in 1976 and $700
million in 1977. Total new commitments of public and private medium- and
long-term capital would reach $2 billion in 1976 and need to be maintained
at approximately this level through 1980.
15.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy, which is pri-
marily a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains
committed to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide
for a continued increase in incomes and employment. Both the Philippine
Government and the Bank' s Basic Economic Report estimate that it should be
possible in the longer term for the Philippine economy to grow in real t:erms
at a rate of about 7 percent per annum provided that good economic management
continues and international economic conditions improve. High priority must
be accorded to expanding employment opportunities because unemployment
and underemployment are still high, and the labor force continues to grow
at 3 percent a year. Continued attention must also be given to expanding
the Government's effective family planning program to reduce the rate of
growth of the population and the labor force.
16.       The Government is pursuing a development strategy which focuses on
rural development with emphasis on food production; accelerated industriali-
zation, both in capital-intensive resource based industries and labor-intensive
export industries and a substantial expansion in public sector investmerLt in
infrastructure to support the growth of the productive sectors. In support
of these objectives, the Government plans to continue its efforts to increase



- 5 -
public revenues, to strengthen the capacity of public sector agencies and to
foster the growth of exports. The Government recognizes that the increased
cost of petroleum and other imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrow-
ing abroad, and it is actively encouraging both local and foreign investors to
expand productive investments. It will, however, take time for Government
programs to have an impact on the balance of payments, and the Government is,
therefore, seeking increased support from the international financial community
to assist in the financing of its development effort.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       By November 30, 1976, the Philippines had received 38 Bank loans (of
which two were on Third Window terms) and 3 IDA credits for a total of $941.5
million, net of cancellations. About one third of Bank lending, $306 million,
has been for infrastructure projects in power, transportation, and water supply
and another third, $303 million, has been for agriculture. Of the remainder,
about $250 million has been for industry and about $83 million has been for
social sector projects in education, population and urban development.
There has been a marked improvement in the execution of Bank-financed projects
in the last four years compared with experience in the 1960s, when there were
serious problems caused by a shortage of peso counterpart funds and poor
administration. All ongoing projects are now being implemented reasonably
well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of October 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
18.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the Philippine development effort with its emphasis on agriculture and infra-
structure and its growing attention to the needs of lower income groups.
About one third of Bank lending planned for the future would continue to be
for agriculture and rural development projects and another third would be for
needed basic infrastructure projects, mainly in the fields of transportation
and power. The amount of lending for social sector projects, including
education, population and urban development, is expected to continue to grow
rapidly and account for nearly 20 percent of future lending. The balance of
future lending would be for industrial development, where growing attention
is being given to the needs of small and medium industries with high employ-
ment potential. The rapid growth in public revenues during the past five
years has allowed for a significant expansion in public investment and both
the ambitious Philippine development program and the Bank's growing lending
program have been designed to make good past neglect and to meet future
needs. Bank lending totalled $165.1 million in FY74, $208 million in FY75
and $268 million in FY76 compared to about $30 million a year in the preceding
five years.
19.       This is the first loan to be presented to the Executive Directors
in FY77.  It is expected to be followed shortly by a loan for the Jalaur
irrigation project. Other loans which may be ready for presentation to the
Executive Directors later in FY77 are for agricultural credit, land settle-
ment, education, power, irrigation and water supply projects. Projects for
smallholder tree farming and forestry development and for inter-island
shipping may be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors in early



- 6 -
FY78. A number of these projects are designed to help the Government meet
its objective of increasing the productivity and incomes of the poorer
segments of the population.
20.       As of October 31, 1976, IFC has made commitments in the Philippines
totalling $78.9 million for investment in 14 companies in the fields of devel-
opment banking, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum
products, nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibres and
edible oils. Of these investments, $18.1 million had been sold, $0.4 million
cancelled and $6.9 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $53.5 million,
including $2.8 million undisbursed.   Preliminary proposals have been received
for projects in the wood and mining industry.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Background
21.       Both sea and land transportation play a major role in the Philippine
economy. Inter-island shipping provides an essential means of communication
among the islands of the archipelago and accounts for about 53 percent of
total freight traffic and about 10 percent of passenger traffic. In recent
years, there has been a considerable expansion of the highway network to the
interior of the main islands of Luzon and Mindanao. Highways today account
for about 44 percent of freight traffic and 80 percent of passenger traffic
on these islands. The role of the railway in the Philippine transport system
has always been insignificant and may decline further with the development of
the highway network. Domestic air traffic has, in recent years, been increas-
ing and now accounts for about 6 percent of passenger traffic.
22.       The transport system in the Philippines has for many years been
inadequate for a number of reasons. Due to the overall lack of public
resources in the past, investment in transport has been insufficient to
provide for the expanding needs of a growing economy. Inadequate funding
and weak administration have resulted in poor maintenance of existing facili-
ties, and insufficient coordination and overlapping of responsibilities among
transport agencies have hampered rational planning and effective project
execution.
23.       In order to help remedy these problems, the Government requested
UNDP assistance to finance a transportation sector study, with the Bank as
Executing Agency, which was completed in 1970. The study identified the
main investment priorities and provided the basis for subsequent public
investment in transportation which rose from about $40 million in FY68 to
about $220 million in FY75. The Project Planning and Development Office
in the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications has
recently updated the investment plan and estimates that public investment in
transportation will need to rise from $365 million in FY77 to about $500 mil-
lion in FY80 in order to make up for the low levels of investment in the past
and to provide for growing traffic levels. About 81 percent of funds under
the investment program will be devoted to improving road transport, 9 percent
for railways, 6 percent for airports and 4 percent for ports. Investment in
inter-island shipping will come mainly from the private sector.



- 7 -
24.        In order to improve administrative capability, the Government has,
since 1972, been reorganizing and streamlining government agencies to provide
for better planning and project execution. As a result, transport planning
is now the joint responsibility of the National Economic and Development
Authority and the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications.
As the central planning agency, the former has the overall responsibility for
planning public capital investments; its Infrastructure Program and Project
Office reviews and approves investments proposed by the transport agencies.
It is assisted in this task by the Inter-Agency Technical Committee on
Transport Planning, staffed with representatives from each transport agency,
which is responsible for helping to formulate long-term plans and policies in
the transportation sector and to ensure appropriate coordination among the
agencies involved. The Planning and Project Development Office under the
Secretary of the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications
has the responsibility for undertaking comprehensive regional planning
studies and for formulating, on this basis, priorities for major infrastructure
projects. The Planning and Project Development Office maintains liaison with
the National Economic and Development Authority and provides the bulk of
technical input to transport planning. The Board of Transportation, a
semiautonomous unit of the Department of Public Works, Transportation and
Communications, handles the quasijudicial function of granting routes to
transport companies and prescribing rates, schedules and regulations for
their operations. The Bureau of Transportation in the Department of Public
Works, Transportation and Communications is responsible within the policy
guidelines of the Board of Transportation for the enforcement of regulations
concerning all modes of transportation, except for railways. The Philippine
National Railway is responsible for the Government railroad and the Philippine
Ports Authority was set up in 1975 to be responsible for port planning and
administration of public ports. The role of the Department of Public Highways
in the transport sector is described in para. 29.
25.       These organizational developments have in practice improved the
planning and coordination functions of the Government. However, there are
still instances of overlapping or lack of coordination. A Bank sector report
has recently reviewed transport planning in the Philippines and recommended a
number of steps to improve coordination in transport planning, and substantial
technical assistance to help the Government in improving the quality of its
long-term investment program and in strengthening the planning capacity of
the various agencies concerned with the transport sector (Bank Report No.
1017a-PH of May 4, 1976). This technical assistance for improving planning
for the transportation sector in the Philippines is being financed under the
loans for the Manila Urban Development Project (Loans 1272-T-PH and 1282-PH).
26.       The proposed project would be the sixth Bank-financed project in
the transportation sector in the Philippines. The previous five loans include
two for ports (Loans 290-PH and 939-PH), two for highways (Loans 731-PH and
950-PH) and one for shipping (Loan 1048-PH). The First Highway Project was
completed in 1975; work had been progressing satisfactorily until March 1973
when it was suspended for about two months due to civil disturbances which
eventually led to the deletion of a section of the road accounting for about
20 percent of the project. None of the loan was cancelled, however, because
of the need for funds to meet the increase in construction costs of the
remaining works. The Second Highway Project is progessing about on schedule



- 8 -
and to date about 60 percent of the civil works have been completed. The
technical assistance which was included in the First Project and continued
in the Second helped to improve DPH organization and operations, but further
assistance is necessary.
The Highway Network
27.       The public highway network, totalling about 99,000 km, consists of
about 23,000 km of national roads, 30,000 km of provincial roads, 27,000 km
of city and municipal roads and 19,000 km of other roads (feeder, farm to
market and other local roads). The road density is relatively high, but the
condition of the highway network is inadequate to serve even existing
transport needs. Due to inadequate investment in the past, only 38 percent
of national highways and 13 percent of provincial roads are paved; the rest
are either gravel or unsurfaced. Moreover, both paved and unpaved roads are
in poor condition because of inappropriate initial design and construction,
and inadequate maintenance. Existing roads are also frequently damaged by
severe flooding in the rainy season, and overloading of trucks, which is
common practice particularly in logging and mining areas. Since 1970, the
Government has made a substantial effort to improve and develop the road
system both through an expanded allocation of domestic budgetary resources
and foreign assistance, mainly from Japan, the United States, IBRD and the
Asian Development Bank. The achievement has been impressive during the last
six years as more than 13,000 km of roads have been constructed or improved.
28.       The motor vehicle fleet grew from about 325,000 units in 1966 to
about 740,000 units in 1975, an annual rate of growth of about 9.6 percent.
The vehicle fleet is fairly large with one vehicle per 60 inhabitants, com-
pared to one per 120 in Thailand and one per 185 in Korea. The rate of growth
in the vehicle fleet has slowed in the last two years due to higher gasoline
prices; but road traffic is nevertheless expected to grow at a rate of 7 to
8 percent a year as economic activity picks up during the coming years. To
rehabilitate the existing road system and to provide for growing land trans-
portation requirements, the Government plans to invest about $1.5 billion
(81 percent of total investment in the transport sector) for highway develop-
ment during the period FY77-80, or three times the amount invested during the
FY72-75 period. It is expected that $300 million would be financed from
foreign assistance and the balance of $1.2 billion financed from domestic
budgetary resources.
The Department of Public Highways (DPH)
29.       DPH has primary responsibility for planning, constructing and main-
taining national roads. The Department is also responsible for the supervi-
sion of the construction and maintenance of farm to market roads. Local
authorities are responsible for the construction and maintenance of provin-
cial, city and municipal roads except for the supervision of construction of
these roads which is the responsibility of DPH when construction is financed
from the National Government's funds.
30.       The Bureau of Construction and Maintenance of DPH supervises 14
regional DPH offices, which are responsible for the construction and mainte-
nance of national roads. There are also 149 district and city offices under



- 9 -
the control of regional offices. The Bureau of Equipment in DPH is responsi-
ble for the management, repair and maintenance of road construction and
maintenance equipment which is rented mainly to DPH regional and district
offices. The Bureau has its own regional equipment services organizations
with direct control of 14 base workshops. The Bureau of Barangay (Village)
Roads supervises the construction and maintenance of farm to market roads.
31.       The Second Highway Project (Loan 950-PH) made provision for
strengthening DPH to help it carry out the rapidly-growing road construction
and maintenance program. Consultant services were provided for construction
supervision, detailed design of future road projects and for assessment of
maintenance and training requirements. While the Second Project is being
successfully implemented, additional assistance is needed to enable DPH to
improve its overall capacity to carry out a much larger program in the years
ahead. In particular, attention needs to be given to improving the capacity
of DPH to plan the future investment program, develop a more effective
maintenance program and strengthen its staff training. (These needs are
discussed in paras. 34-37).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
32.      The proposed project is designed to assist the Government to improve
high priority major and minor roads which form part of its four-year invest-
ment program and to strengthen DPH to enable it to carry out the much larger
future road program. Both the program and the Bank-financed project appro-
priately emphasize road improvement, restoration and maintenance rather than
new construction. The road component of the project was prepared by the DPH
with the help of consultants financed under a UNDP Project, for which the
Bank was Executing Agency, and the road maintenance and training components
were prepared with the help of consultants financed under the loans for the
First and Second Highway Projects. A Bank mission appraised the project in
April/May 1976 and negotiations were held in November 1976. The leader of
the Government's negotiating team was the Honorable Baltazar Aquino, Secretary
of the Department of Public Highways. The Appraisal Report (No. 1297a-PH) on
the proposed project is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
Description of the Project
33.       The proposed project would provide for:
(a) the construction and improvement of 10 sections of
national roads totalling about 500 km and 16 sections
of minor roads totalling about 230 km, mainly on Mindanao
and the Visayan Islands;
(b) implementation of the first phase of a road maintenance
program comprising: (i) the construction or enlargement
of 5 base and 23 area workshops in Luzon; (ii) procurement



- 10 -
of road maintenance equipment including spares, hand
tools, workshop tools and machinery; (iii) procurement of
spares and components for existing equipment; and (iv)
restoration of deteriorated sections of the national road
network to a maintainable condition as provided for in
the first two years of DPH's Five Year Road Restoration
Program; and
(c) consulting services for: (i) the supervision of construc-
tion and improvement of the project roads; (ii) feasibility
studies of about 1,400 km of national roads, 800 km of
minor roads and seven ferry crossings, and detailed
engineering of elements found to be justified; and (iii)
technical assistance to help strengthen the capacity of
DPH to implement the project and its future investment
program, improve its road maintenance program, strengthen
its planning capability and develop more effective
training programs for its management and operational
personnel.
Institutional Objectives
34.       A central focus of the project is to assist DPH to improve its over-
all capacity to carry out a larger road program and, in particular, to remedy
certain weaknesses which have adversely affected its performance in the past.
Despite considerable improvement over the last several years, the two Bureaus
of the DPH most directly responsible for carrying out the national highway
program need support to upgrade their technical capacity. The project would
therefore provide for four experts for two years each to advise the chiefs of
the Construction, Maintenance, Design, and Soils and Materials Divisions of
the Bureau of Construction and Maintenance. Two short-term experts would also
be employed in the Maintenance Division to assist, respectively, with road
maintenance and road restoration. In addition, one expert would be provided
for a period of two years to advise the Director of the Bureau of Equipment in
organizing a network of workshops. Two short-term experts would also assist
the Bureau's Director, one in the reorganization of spare parts depots and
procurement of spares, and the other with the procurement of equipment, tools
and workshop machinery.
35.       Road maintenance has been a chronic problem in the Philippines due
to insufficient funds, lack of necessary equipment and ineffective planning,
budgetary and operating procedures. Consultants, financed under previous Bank-
financed highway projects, have made a number of recommendations for improving
the existing road maintenance program and prepared a Five Year Maintenance
Program, which has been accepted by the Government. In addition to the tech-
nical assistance to the Maintenance Division described in the preceding para-
graph, the project provides for the establishment of maintenance workshops and
equipment needed to implement an improved maintenance program on Luzon. The
Government has agreed that the procedures proposed in the Road Maintenance
Program will be applied in 1977 and thereafter, and that sufficient funds will
be made available to finance an effective maintenance program. Annual physical



- 11 -
targets and budget allocations will be submitted to the Bank for its review and
approval. As part of its Road Maintenance Program, the Government has also
agreed to undertake a Road Restoration Program, as recommended by its consult-
ants, which would provide for minimum improvements, prevent further deteriora-
tion of the road network and reduce maintenance costs in the future (Section
4.03, draft Loan Agreement). The proposed Bank loan would help finance the
first two years of the Road Restoration Program and disbursement for this
purpose would be subject to the Bank's approval of the annual plans of the
Road Restoration Program to be financed under the loan (para. 4 (ii) of
Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement).
36.       A Planning and Development Service has been established in DPH with
responsibility for planning the road investment program. It has undertaken
planning of minor roads, but will need to upgrade its capacity greatly if it
is to carry out fully its planning responsibilities and supervise a large
program of feasibility studies. An expert has already been appointed to
assist the Director of the Planning and Development Service for a period of
two years in developing statistical data, including traffic counts for the
purpose of improving the preparation of highway programs. Since the Service
is presently entirely staffed by engineers, DPH has agreed to employ three
economists; it has also agreed to endeavor to fill 15 vacant professional
positions in this office by December 31, 1977 (Section 4.06, draft Loan
Agreement). The Government is in the process of introducing improved pro-
cedures for collection of the traffic data needed for better planning and
has agreed to have the new system in full operation by December 31, 1977
(Section 4.04, draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The improvement of the road network together with the technologi-
cal advances experienced in highway maintenance, construction and equipment
have accentuated the need for more comprehensive and organized programs of
training for both existing and new personnel. Estimates of consultants and
the Bank appraisal mission indicate that over the next five years DPH will
need to train: 540 equipment operators, 860 equipment servicing mechanics,
1,200 maintenance field supervisors and 70 management staff. To assist DPH
to carry out this program, three training advisors would be provided to the
Department for a period of two years each.
Execution of the Road Component
38.       DPH, with assistance from consultants, would be responsible for
executing the project. A special projects office for implementing Bank-
assisted highway projects has been established in the DPH and an advisor to
the head of this office would continue to be financed for two years under
Loan 950-PH. All road construction would be carried out by contractors.
Supervision of construction would be carried out by consultants, except for
those roads engineered by DPH which would be supervised by its Regional
Offices. In order to avoid possible delays in construction, it has been
agreed that acquisition of the necessary right of way would be completed for
each road section before contracts for improvement of the section are awarded
(Section 3.07, draft Loan Agreement).

Project Cost and Financing
39.       The project is estimated to cost a total of $196 million, of which
$95 million, or about 48 percent, would be in foreign exchange. The average
construction cost per km (net of contingencies) is $160,000 for national
roads and $40,000 for minor roads. The average man-month rate (including
costs of international travel and local travel and housing allowance) for
foreign consultants is estimated to be about $8,250.    The cost estimates
include provision for physical contingencies of 10 percent of the baseline
cost of all items including consultants. The cost estimates also provide for
price contingencies of 26 percent of the cost of civil works (12 percent per
annum for 1977-79 and 10 percent for 1980), 21 percent of the cost of consul-
tant services (8 percent per annum for 1977-79 and 7 percent for 1980) and
8 percent of the costs of equipment over a one-year period. The proposed
Bank loan of $95 million would finance the foreign exchange cost of the
project. The Government would finance the balance of project costs of
$101 million from budgetary resources. Retroactive financing of about
$50,000 is recommended to pay for the services of the expert who is assisting
the Director of the Planning and Development Service in the Department of
Public Highways (para. 4 of Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement). This
expert was urgently needed to assist in improving DPH's planning capacity,
and his appointment and terms of reference were approved by the Bank.
Procurement
40.       Contracts for the construction and improvement of the national
roads amounting to about $80 million (net of contingencies) would be awarded
to prequalified contractors on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. The majority of these contracts
are expected to be awarded to local construction firms. Contracts for
reconstruction of minor roads, averaging about $500,000 each and amounting to
about $9 million, for construction of workshops, averaging about $150,000
each and amountir.g to $4.3 million, and for the restoration of the national
road network, amounting to about $21 million, are small and are geographi-
cally scattered and would therefore be awarded to qualified local contractors
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with
Government procedures which are acceptable. Foreign contractors would be
eligible to participate.
41.       Workshop equipment, tools, road maintenance equipment, spare parts,
and components, amounting to about $14.3 million, would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. For purposes of bid comparison, a preference of 15 percent of
the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever is lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers. Items costing less than $15,000
and hand tools for road maintenance would be procured under normal Government
procurement procedures which are acceptable; the aggregate amount of such
purchases would not exceed $500,000.



- 13 -
Disbursement
42.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for 50 percent of the total cost
of construction and improvement of roads, 30 percent of the total cost of
construction of workshops, 40 percent of costs of road restoration works,
100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment, spare parts,
tools and components, 100 percent of the ex-factory price of such items
manufactured locally or 65 percent of such items which are imported but
procured locally. For costs of consultants and technical assistance, the
loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost or
45 percent of the total cost.
Environmental Impact
43.       No significant environmental problems are expected.    The recon-
structed roads have improved drainage facilities and would thus benefit
the immediate environment. As a result of road improvement, vehicle noise
and dust would be considerably reduced. Wider and well constructed shoulders
would contribute to road safety. The roads largely follow existing align-
ments, thereby minimizing disturbances to persons and property.
Benefits and Justification
44.       The construction and improvement of national roads (500 km) and
the reconstruction of minor roads (230 km) under the project will help the
Government in its efforts to achieve the ambitious target of constructing and
improving about 25,700 km of national, provincial and local roads during the
next Investment Program (1977-80). This project supports the Government's
present strategy of giving emphasis to reconstruction of low quality roads
and to the paving of existing gravel roads, which still account for over half
of the national network, rather than concentrating on the construction of new
high-standard highways. Feasibility studies of roads have shown that for
most sections, at the present time, the optimum first stage of improvement is
to pave or gravel the road largely on the present alignment, with provision
for widening and improvements in drainage. The present approach of minimizing
and phasing investments makes it possible to meet a much larger total transport
demand at lower cost. The direct benefits that would accrue from the project
would be substantially reduced costs of moving goods and people and access to
some isolated areas with high economic development potential. The savings of
vehicle operating costs on the improved national roads would range from 15 to
53 percent and on minor roads from 27 to 56 percent.
45.       The potential of the project for relieving unemployment in the
country has been considered. Although the contractors are left to choose
their own construction methods, employment is expected to be generated by the
prospective award of most contracts to local contractors. Many local sub-
contractors, using labor-intensive methods, particularly for the supply of
materials, are also expected to be employed by both local and foreign contrac-
tors. An ILO technical assistance team is now in the Philippines to advise
the Government on labor-intensive techniques. The Bank plans to study the
results of the work of this team and, if appropriate, will consider including



- 14 -
a component in the next highway project to serve as a pilot program for more
labor-intensive methods.
46.       The major roads in the Visayas region would support mining activi-
ties on Cebu island, sugarcane processing on Panay and Negros islands as well
as other agriculture, trade and services activities. The national roads in
Mindanao would serve one of the most rapidly growing areas of the Philippines,
which has considerable potential for increasing production of rice, corn,
sugarcane, livestock and timber. The minor roads, both in the Visayas and
Mindanao, would help open up isolated areas with dense population or potential
for new rural settlements. The areas served have potential for increasing
production of rice, sugarcane, pineapple, corn and vegetables.
47.       The economic rates of return for each national road section have
been worked out separately and they vary between 18 and 36 percent. Sensi-
tivity analyses indicate that even with a variety of unfavorable assumptions,
the rates of return on the major roads would still range from 15 to 31 percent.
The weighted overall average economic rate of return for the major roads is
estimated to be 23 percent. The minor roads would open up potential develop-
ment areas and connect local traffic to the national road system, but their
full development impact is difficult to measure. Taking into account only
the expected vehicle operating cost savings and reductions in passenger
travel time, the first year benefits on the minor roads range between 10 and
60 percent. The weighted average first year benefit on these roads is
estimated to be 16 percent.
48.       The road maintenance program would cover some 22,500 km of graveled
and paved national roads and would provide for considerable savings in
vehicle operating costs. Based on expected vehicle operating cost savings,
the maintenance program over the next five years is estimated to have a
benefit cost ratio of 2.3. Sensitivity analyses indicate that under less
favorable assumptions the benefit cost ratio would still be 1.5. In addition,
the program would result in considerable savings in future public investment
as additional resources would be required in a few years to rehabilitate the
network if the maintenance program were not undertaken.
49.       In addition to the quantifiable benefits described above, a central
objective of the project is to strengthen the long-term capacity of DPH to
carry out effectively a larger highway program in the future. The technical
assistance and training provided under the project have been carefully
designed to achieve this objective.
50.       There are no unusual risks associated with the project.    The risks
normally associated with road projects have been accounted for in the
estimates of traffic growth rate and savings in vehicle operating costs.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Loan No. 637    Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; $34.0 Million Loan of
August 18, 1960; Date of Effectiveness: October 15, 1960;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area.
The project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future
irrigation development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the
1972 floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
Most of the work has been completed and the Loan is expected to be entirely
disbursed by the Closing Date. The Closing Date was postponed to allow dis-
bursement for the foreign exchange costs of the communications system which
is scheduled for completion April 1977. Project costs have increased 40 per-
cent over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the
effects of successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam
(which accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in
costs is being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close
coordination established between irrigation and agricultural support services,
the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate. Also,
nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including lands
which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there has
been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice. As
a result the estimated rate of return is now higher than at appraisal.
Loan No. 720    Rice Processing and Storage; $14.3 Million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and
modernization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the
project was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis
was on the construction of new integrated large capacity rice mills. Due in
part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for subloans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be

small, and, as explained in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the Loan Agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The Loan Agreement was amended again in
April 1974 to (a) expand the scope of the project to include corn in addi-
tion to rice, (b) enable local governments and the National Grains Authority
to borrow funds under the project, and (c) streamline procurement procedures
(President's Memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974). As a result of these
amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactorily and the loan is
expected to be fully committed by February 1977 and fully disbursed before
the revised Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Loan No. 809     Fifth Power; $22.0 Million Loan and $10.0 Million
Credit No. 296 Credit of April 3, 1972; Date of Effectiveness
July 1, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150 MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. Although there has been some minor delay
due to the late delivery of transformers, the project is proceeding satis-
factorily, and the unit is expected to be commissioned before the end of
1976. The erection of transmission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is now expected to be
completed in April 1977. A tariff increase was approved, effective July 1,
1974, and a second tariff increase has recently been approved. However,
NPC is unlikely to be able to earn a rate of return on net fixed assets in
operation in 1976 because of delays in implementing the second tariff
increase.
Credit No. 471 Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; $9.5 Million Credit and
Loan No. 984     $9.5 Million Loan of May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness:
August 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation
project in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project provides
for diversion of water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir,
to provide year-round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central Luzon.
The project also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central Luzon
to inventory water, land and other resources, and identify priority irriga-
tion projects. The interim report was completed on schedule and the final
report is expected in June 1977. Although there has been some delay in
constructing the two diversion dams because of the need for more extensive
foundations and abutment area grouting than originally expected, most diffi-
culties have been overcome and the work is progressing satisfactorily.
Diversion of 75 percent of Aurora water into Pantabangan Reservoir was
achieved in September 1975, one year ahead of the appraisal schedule. All
remaining engineering work OnI the second division dam was completed in
July 1976, one year ahead of schedule. In the area served by the project,

Page 5
lack of competition caused some delay in awarding of contracts, but this
has been overcome. Efforts to attract bids from more local contractors
have been very effective. Urgent work is being done by Government force
account. Project costs have increased about 54 percent over appraisal
estimates, largely as a result of inflation. There would be added benefits
from early diversion, however, resulting in additional water for irriga-
tion sooner than planned, but the rate of return is expected to fall from
17 percent at appraisal to 14 percent.
Loan No. 998     Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-Farmers:
$50.0 Million Loan of June 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: September 9, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the Loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the Loan ($48 million)
is being used by DBP to finance direct imports for medium and relatively
large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance ($2 million) to finance
about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming project. The Loan is now
virtually fully committed for subloans. The project is progressing satisfac-
torily.
Loan No. 1010    Third Rural Credit; $22.0 Million Loan of June 17, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These
onlend the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment
in farm mechanization, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities
and equipment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock devel-
opment and cottage-scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a
review of the effectiveness of the first, second and this third project.
The Loan was fully committed by Mlarch 1976. Collection of arrears by about
200 participating banks from beneficiaries under the first and second
projects is not satisfactory. This is being watched closely by Bank staff
and appropriate steps are being taken by the Central Bank to improve such
collections.
Loan No. 1034     Sixth Power:  $61.0 Million Loan of July 31, 1974:
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for
the further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by con-
sultants for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has
been contracted and project commissioning is expected in January 1977,



ANNEX II
Page 6
been contracted and project commissioning is expected in January 1977,
three months ahead of original schedule. The transmission component of the
project is behind schedule because necessary design work has been delayed
due to NPC's heavy construction program. It is now expected that this part
of the project will be completed by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind
schedule. NPC raised its tariffs on July 1, 1974, and a second tariff
increase was recently approved. However, NPC is unlikely to be able to
earn a rate of return on net fixed assets in operation because of delays in
implementing the second tariff increase.
Credit No. 349 Second Education; $12.7 Million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credit is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocational education and for improvement in curriculum devel-
opment and teacher training. Construction is about 11 months behind
schedule mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of
buildings and recruitment of specialist services. This delay is being
reduced through effective management by the project unit. Procurement of
equipment is on schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical
assistance have been revised to suit the current needs of project institu-
tions and to expedite implementation. Disbursements are ahead of the
appraisal estimate. Project costs are now estimated to be about 25 per-
cent higher than the appraisal estimates. Despite initial delays, the
project is expected to be completed on schedule.
Loan No. 891     Fisheries; $11.6 Million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: December 5, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long-term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and inland
fisheries development. The demand for subloans has been adequate, and the
organization to implement them has been properly established. The project is
progressing satisfactorily, and all funds were fully committed by July 1976.
Loan No. 939     Second Ports; $6.1 Million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: December 19, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of
the ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro on the island of Mindanao.
The contract for General Santos was awarded in May 1975 but work has slowed
down due to dredging difficulties. For Cagayan de Oro, after about nine
months' delay, the contract was awarded on March 12, 1976 and work has now
commenced. The civil works were about 15 percent completed as of October 31,
1976.

Loan No. 950    Second Highway; $68.0 Million Loan of December 12,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: December 27, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program
of construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder
roads, by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of
1,400 km of roads in Luzon. Works were about 70 percent completed as of
September 1, 1976 on 14 contracts, 10 of which were awarded to local con-
tractors. Costs have increased sharply, but price adjustments are being
awarded to contractors by the Government to offset the sharp rises in costs
of basic materials, fuels and labor. The UNDP-financed Road Feasibility
Studies (Phase II), - for-which the Bank is Executing Agency, have- been -com-
pleted and a Third Highway Project is being presented to the Board with this
report. Execution of other minor project items is generally proceeding on
schedule.
Loan No. 1035   Population; $25.0 Million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 13, 1974; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1979                   -
The project is assisting the Government in expanding rural health
infrastructure, staff training facilities, and research and communications
capacity. Under the direction of Project Management Staff in the Department
of Health, overall project implementation is progressing well. Training
activities are well ahead of schedule in all 12 regions; the civil works
component lags by 9 months, but.is projected to be completed ahead-of the
appraisal report timetable due to simplification of construction design.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1048   Interisland Shipping; $20 Million Loan of October 29.
1974; Date of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
The Government is relending the proceeds of the Loan to the
Development Bank of the Philippines for onlending to beneficiaries for
the acquisition of new and used ships and for major repairs and conver-
sions. Progress under the project is satisfactory. About $7 million have
been committed as of November 1, 1976.
Loan No. 1052   Private Development Corporation of the Philippines;
$30 million Loan of November 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: February 7, 1975; Closing Date:

water pilot scheme, a water management training program and a national
irrigation systems improvement study (NISIS). The project is progressing
satisfactorily with exceptionally good interest in the bidding for civil
works contracts. Procurement of equipment has been slow, but this problem
has been overcome. The feasibility report for the first NISIS package was
completed in September 1976.
Loan No. 1102   Rural Development; $25.0 Million Loan of April 16,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: July 28, 1975; Closing

and improvement of the national roads, amount-
ing to about $80 million, would be awarded to
prequalified contractors on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines;
(b)  civil works contracts for the construction
of minor roads, averaging about $500,000 each
and amounting to about $9 million, would be
awarded to prequalified contractors on the
basis of local competitive bidding following
procedures and conditions which are acceptable
to the Bank; foreign contractors would be
eligible to participate in the bidding;
(c)  civil works contracts for the construction and
extension of workshops averaging about $150,000
each, and amounting to about $4 million,
would be awarded to local contractors on the
basis of local competitive bidding following
procedures and conditions which are acceptable

(e) Workshop equipment, tools, road mainten-
ance equipment, spare parts and components,
amounting to about $14.5 million, would
be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. A preference limited
to 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of imported
goods or the level of customs duty, whichever
is the lower, would be afforded to local
manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Items costing less than $15,000 and hand tools
for road maintenance would be procured under
normal Government procedures, which are
acceptable. The aggregate amount of such
purchases would not exceed $500,000.
Consultants and
Technical Assistance:    Consultants would be appointed for supervision
of the construction of project roads and for
carrying out feasibility studies and engineering
of national roads and ferry crossings. A total
of ten experts would be retained to strengthen
the DPH and help implement a road maintenance
program (168 man-months) and three experts to
help with the training of DPH management and
operational staff at various levels (72 man-
months).
Rate of Return:            The economic rate of return for the national
road sections is estimated to vary between 18 and
36 percent. The overall average economic rate of
return is estimated to be 23 percent. The minor
roads would open up potential development areas and
connect local traffic to the national road system
but their developmental impact is difficult to
measure. The first-year benefit on these roads
ranges between 10 and 60 percent. The average
first year benefit is estimated to be 16 percent.
The maintenance program over the next five years
is estimated to have a cost benefit ratio of 2.3.
Appraisal Report:          No. 1297a-PH, dated December 10, 1976.
