INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT ANI) RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
1O THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the i-ollowing report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$8.0 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a rural development project in
the  'ill districts of Nluwakot and Rasuwa.  The UNDP is expected to provide
about $500,000 for the technical assistance requirements of the project.
About 4% of the credit ($359,000) will be on-lent to the Agricultural Develop-
ment Bank of Nepal (ADBN4) (see paragraph 43).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "A Review of Mfajor Issues
Related to Nepal's DeveLopment Prospects" (Report No. 677a-NEP) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1975. The principal updated
findings and conclusions of that report are summarized below. Country data
are shown in Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1974 was
estimated at $90-100 per year and the literacy rate at about 14%. Serious
efforts toward development have been underway only since the 1960's. Develop-
ment expenditures have increased rapidly from NRs 232 million in 1964/65 to
NRs 926 million in 1974/75. About half of expenditures for development has
been financed with external assistance, notably from India, the United
States and the People's Republic of China. About 80% has been in the form
of grants.
4.        Nepal's economic growth over the last nine years has been slow.
From 1965-67 to 1973-75, the average annual rate of growth of GDP was only
2.2% in real terms. During the same period population increased at a rate
of over 2%. There was, therefore, hardly any impro,iement in GDP per capita.
Agriculture accounts for about two-thirds of GDP and for 80% of export earn-
ings and provides employment to 94% of the population. Foodgrain production
has grown at less than 1% annually since the mid-1960's. If present trends
in the growth of population and foodgrain production continue, Nepal may
have a foodgrain deficit by the turn of the decade. Nepal is currently
exporting over 200,000 tons of rice a year, accounting for about 60% of
export earnings. Some progress was achieved in the organized manufacturing
sector which, however, accounts for less than 3% of GDP.
5.        This slow growth was largely due to the priority given to develop-
ment of road infrastructure over the directly producing sectors. This
priority was probably an inescapable necessity. When the country began to
come out of its isolation in 1951, it had no transportation facilities and

- 2 -
hardly any trained people to man an administration oriented towards economic
development. At least one generation was needed to build a minimal physical
and administrative infrastructure without which a development policy is de-
void of meaning. In that respect, substantial progress has been achieved.
6.        In the past, only 20% of public sector investments was made in
the directly producing sectors which largely benefited the Kathmandu Valley,
and, to a lesser extent, the eastern Terai plains. The development of the
Kathmandu Valley, where 4%0 of Nepal's population lives, has been a success
story. New cultivation methods have been widely adopted and the farming
counmunity is enjoying an improved standard of living. With the Fifth Five-
Year Plan (1975/76-1979/80), Nepal is now attempting to shift its order of
priorities and to focus on the productive sectors and the development of its
very substantial hydroelectric potential. HIalf of planned development ex-
penditures is tentatively allocated to these sectors; 30% of public sector
capital expenditures are planned to be allocated to agricultural and rural
development. The basic strategy of the Fifth Plan towards agriculture is
to balance growth with income distribution and provide for regional development.
Largely because of absorptive capacity problems, the country may experience
serious difficulties in redirecting its investments along this new and very
pertinent course.
7.        Nepal's development is likely to be impaired seriously by the re-
cent changes in world economic conditions. The country has to import prac-
tically all capital and manufactured consumer goods. World price in-
creases are, therefore, greatly affecting Nepal, at a time when export
prospects are not encouraging. As the country is landlocked, it depends on
India for most of its imports, but India has developed shortages of its own.
This has forced Nepal to import from distant places at high prices together
with very high freight and transit costs through India, particularly for
bulky commodities such as cement. For the ten years ending in the latter
part of 1974 the trade deficit was more than offset by invisible earnings,
mainly from remittances and pensions, interest on external reserves and
tourism. Over this period balance of payments surpluses amounted to about
$10 million a year and foreign exchange reserves were at the very comfortable
level of $139 million in November 1974 (more than 12 months of imports).
However, and largely because of changes in world prices in late 1974, Nepal's
foreign exchange reserves declined to $94 million by September 1975. This
decline is expected to continue at a rate of $20-25 million a year, unless
Nepal succeeds in obtaining increased foreign assistance (see paragraph 12).
8.        If imports have to be curtailed, this would not only directly
affect economic activity but also the potential for domestic resource
mobilization, as nearly two-thirds of tax and non-tax revenue is col-
lected on external transactions. Revenue potentials from other tax
sources are limited, given the poverty of the country and the low degree
of monetization of the economy. For years to come, dynamic export growth
is likely to be one of the few potential avenues for increasing resource
mobilization. Export potentials lie mostly in the development of agricul-
ture, tourism and hydro-power.



- 3 -
9.        On October 9, 1975 the Nepal Rupee was devalued against the U.S.
dollar from Rs 10.56 to Rs 12.50 to the dollar. Rates for other foreign
currencies will be established daily by the Nepal Rastra (Central) Bank on
the basis of the parity rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies.
The parity rate with the Indian Rupee remains unchanged. This selective
devaluation was addressed to the problems of increasing earnings of converti-
ble foreign exchange and reducing the demand for such exchange, encouraging
labor-intensive investments, reducing the diversion of trade through unof-
ficial channels, restoring the profitability of jute exports and increasing
revenues in Hill areas by enhancing the rupee value of pensions and remit-
tances received mainly by retired Gurkhas who had served abroad. While it
is difficult to fully assess the impact of the devaluation, there can be
little doubt that it was a step in the right direction.
10.       In April 1975, substantial changes were made in the pricing of
resources to consumers and investors. Consumer subsidies on basic commodi-
ties, such as rice and sugar which in the recent past were growing rapidly,
have beeni almost entirely rescinded. In addition a major reform of the
interest rate structure was introduced in April 1975 with a view to in-
creasing mobilization of private savings and rationalizing resource allo-
cation. This welcome and timely reform entails an increase of the two-
year fixed savings deposit rate from 9-3/4 to 16% per annum.    Lending rates
of coimnercial banks have been raised to the level of 15-18% per annum and
those of financial institutions to 10-16%. These rates were introduced
when the rate of inflation was about 20% a year. Inflation has however,
declined markedly since then; in the 12 month period ending October 1975,
it was '%..
11.       Development expenditures, including foreign assistance, for the
Fifth Plan (1975/76-1979/80) are estimated at about $670 million, i.e.,
twice as much in real terms as during the previous plan (1970/71-1974/75).
The plan may be ambitious compared to the likely availability of resources
and to the country's implementation capacity. Substantial additional foreign
assistance above the present level would be required. Regular expenditures
are likely to increase sharply on account of rapidly growing expenditures
in social sectors, especially in education, increased maintenance and manage-
inent cost of previous investments, and additional administrative costs re-
quired to decentralize Government (HMG) services. As in the past, increase
in IIG's recurrent expenditures is likely to outstrip growth of revenue so
that the budget surplus is likely to fall sharply, possibly to a third of its
current level in real terms. In view of this, an IDA economic mission visited
Nepal in January to review the public sector investment program and the related
resource requirements; their report is expected to be issued in June of this
year.
12.       In summary, an the one hand, the extreme poverty of the country
points to its limited capacity to generate resources; on the other hand,
urgent development needs and the expected gradual improvement in the coun-
try's absorptive capacity will lead to an increasing demand for foreign ex-
change. Consequently, Nepal's requirements for foreign assistance on soft



terms will rise rapidly. There is also a clear need for some local cost
financing, as most projects with high development priority have a larger do-
mestic cost component than can be mobilized from internal sources.
13.       So far, Nepal's external debt has been very low.   As mentioned in
paragraph 2, the bulk of foreign aid has been in the form of grants. As of
December 31, 1974 official foreign debt amounted to only $106.2 million of
which $71.0 million remained undisbursed. This low utilization is largely
due to the fact that 3/4 of foreign loans have been contracted after mid-1970.
Consequently, debt service was about $1.5 million in 1974 or equivalent to
about 1.9% of exports of goods and services. IDA's share in the debt service
was negligible. However, future assistance may increasingly take the form
of loans, albeit soft. In view of the accelerated development efforts,
external public debt is expected to rise and, based on the trend in recent
years, may well reach $250 million by 1980, of which approximately 2/3 could
be in IDA credits. The debt service ratio by 1980 is, however forecast to
remain below 10%, of which the Bank Group's share would be less than 1%.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
14.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiva-
lent was made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed
by credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($3.2 million), irrigation
($6 million), a second telecommunications project ($5.5 million) a water
supply and sewerage project ($7.8 million), a settlement project ($6.0 mil-
lion) and a power project ($26.0 million). The proposed credit would bring
the total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to $66.7 million equivalent net
of cancellations. No Bank loan has been made to Nepal. IFC made its first
investment in Nepal (US$3.2 million) in a hotel project in Kathmandu in
FY75. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as
of December 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing IDA projects. It
shows certain delays in the implementation of these projects, particularly
during the initial periods. These delays are largely due to Nepal's limited
technical and managerial capabilities. In order to assist Nepal in coping
with this constraint, considerable technical assistance is being given in
the form of inputs of staff time in Washington, from our Resident Mission
in Kathmandu, and during frequent missions to Nepal. As a result, tangible
improvements in the rate of disbursements are being realized. During FY75,
$1.7 million were disbursed, compared to $2.6 million disbursed during the
previous five years.
15.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level
compared to the country's needs for, and total receipts of, external assis-
tance. This is due to the country's limited absorptive capacity, affecting
the rate of project preparation and implementation. The Bank has, therefore,
agreed with HMG to assist it in project preparation, particularly by acting
as Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance projects in the
UNDP Five-Year Program, now under consideration.



16.       Bank Group objectives in Nepal reflect the country's needs:    (a) to
place major emphasis upon directly productive sectors, particularly agricul-
ture and increasing food production; and (b) to continue assistance for the
development of complementary infrastructure -- including feeder roads to
support other development expenditures, facilities to expedite communications
(particularly between the Hills and the Terai), and additional hydroelectric
capacity to meet the predicted increase in demand for energy for agricultural
and industrial development.
17.       Preparation work is being carried out for a number of projects,
including a second irrigation project, a DFC project, a feeder roads project
and a cement project. In view of the institutional constraints and shortage
of trained personnel in Nepal, technical assistance and training would be
an important element in the proposed project as well as in many future
projects.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN NEPAL
18.       Nepal's agriculture accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, 80%
of export earnings and 94% of employment. Growth of agricultural GDP has
been largely through opening up new lands in the Terai. Foodgrain produc-
tion is the most important agricultural activity, but over the past decade,
yields and per capita production have declined. Livestock accounts for 22%
of the agricultural output, but productivity is low because of disease, poor
genetic stock and inadequate feeding resulting from pressure of livestock
on existing fodder resources. Nevertheless, livestock products contribute
an important part of the subsistence diet in the form of milk, ghee, eggs and
meat, and in many Hill areas provide the only source of cash income. The
Dairy Development Corporation (DDC) is responsible for development of the
dairy industry. It operates a milk plant in Kathmandu and manufactures cheese
and butter from milk collected from smallholders.
19.       Agricultural, extension is weak, reflecting inadequate staff and
training, limited research and lack of facilities. Extension at farm level
is carried out by Junior Technical Assistants (JTAs) who have one year's agri-
cultural training. They are supervised by Junior Technicians (2 year dip-
lomas) and District Agricultural Development Officers (university graduates).
In Hill areas, there is about one JTA to every 7,000 farmers.
20.       The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation (MFAI) with a
large research complex near Kathmandu and twelve small stations elsewhere,
mainly carries out research in food crop production. USAID supports cereal
improvement based on high-yielding wheat from India and rice from the
Philippines (International Rice Research Institute). UNDP in conjunction
with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CYIMMT) is helping
a high protein maize program.



21.       The Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science of Tribhuvan
University is responsible for training JTs and JTAs. The Institute also
provides vocational training for agricultural teachers and in-service
training of extension workers and farmers. Most farmer training is
undertaken by the Department of Agriculture but training facilities are
generally lacking throughout Nepal.
22.       Nepal, with an irrigable potential of 1.3 million ha (80% in the
Terai), has some 250,000 ha presently irrigated, of which 150,000 ha are
under small farmer owned and operated systems. Irrigation is generally
supplementary and needed to extend the growing season beyond the four-
month rainy period. Of the present area under farmer operated irriga-
tion, the proportion of potential benefits realized is small because of
poor water management and incomplete distribution systems. Government
operated schemes are relatively new and the activities of the Department of
Irrigation, Hydrology and Meteorology in this field are still at an early
stage of development.
23.       The Land Reform Act (1964) initiated a credit program, which
provided sources of funds for village committees to lend to farmers. However
these sources are presently suspended pending the completion of audits and
the only source of credit is now through the Agricultural Development Bank
(ADBN). ADBN either lends directly to large farmers or, in the case of small
farmers, through guided cooperatives 1/ or guided village committees 1/.    In-
stitutional credit accounts for about 20% of all agricultural credit and
reaches about 18% of all farmers, the rest is provided by money-lenders,
friends and relatives. The Nepal Rastra (Central) Bank (NRB) supervises
banking and provides refinance to ADBN and commercial banks for agricul-
tural loans. ADBN, established in 1967, has authorized capital of NRS 75
million (US$6.0 million), of which HMG owns 84% and NRB 14%. Recovery of
loans over the past five years has been 85%; major loan activities have been
in the areas of farm production and improvement (80%) and marketing and
agro-industry (19%).
24.       Farmers are usually faced with shortages and late delivery of
farming inputs as the Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC) has diffi-
culties with procurement, transportation and distribution, brought about
by limited resources and Nepal's landlocked position.
25.       In spite of heavy investments in infrastructure, lack of accessi-
bility and transportation are major constraints to Hill development as most
districts still lack any road communication with markets. Movement of
produce, inputs and goods is almost entirely by porterage.
26.       Agricultural marketing is constrained by lack of market centers
and a standardized measurement system, poor market information, inadequate
storage and transportation and a small domestic market. Farm produce is
sold to merchants and only retail prices of certain essential commodities
are controlled.
1/   Those with managers trained and appointed by ADBN.



27.       The past feudal land structure with its complex tenurial systems
was abolished by two major pieces of legislation in 1959 and 1964. These
Acts had the combined effect of fixing ceilings of 4.1 ha for tenants and
10 ha for landlords and providing for the sale of surplus land. The per-
formance of land reform has not been up to expectations, as land ceilings
have not released as much land as expected, but it- has reduced the farm
size of large landlords.
28.       The present forest area in Nepal is estimated at about 5 million
lha. Due to accessibility the sub-tropical Terai forests have been the prin-
cipal area of commercial. exploitation. However, much of the Hills forests
have already been lost to settlement and over-exploitation for fuel wood and
as loppings for animal fodder or green manure (estimated to be at the rate
of 2% annually). In many areas, this denudation has led to increased ero-
sion. The Department of Forestry has made little attempt to remedy the loss
of forest stock, though some areas have been closed to permit natural
regeneration.
29.       Most families practice mixed cropping and keep some livestock;
this helps provide a balanced diet, but surveys indicate malnutrition and
protein deficiencies particularly in Hill areas. Although starvation is
not apparent, significant numbers, especially in the upper Hills, live
very close to the margin. As holdings are small, food production is
sufficient to give a family about S to 9 months of its yearly subsistancc
requirement. Wiierever possible, the gap is met from alternative eaploy-
mient sources such as porterage.
PART lV - THlL PROJECT
Background
30.       The proposed project would be the first Bank operation for rural
developiaent undertaken in Nepal.  The project was appraised in January/
February 1975, followed by an updating and review mission in September 1975.
Negotiations took place from January 6 to 8, 1976. The Nepalese negotiating
team was led by Dr. Devendra Raj Panday, Additional Secretary, Foreign
Aid Division, Ministry of Finance. A report entitled "Appraisal of Rural
Development Project" (Report No. 959a-NEP, dated February 2, 1975) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
31.       This project proposes to support a comprehensive development of the
rural Hill districts of Nuwakot and Rasuwa located north of Kathmandu.    It
would support the development strategy of 11MC whichi seeks to balance eco-
nomiic growth with improved income distribution, provide for more equitable
regional development and ensure procluctive benefits from previous road
developments.



- 8 -
32.       Some 29,000 families reside in the project area, 96% of whom farm
less than 1.0 ha with holdings averaging about 0.3 ha (among the smallest
in the world). A major goal of the project is to increase farm productivity
for approximately 85% of the families in the area to the point where they
are able to meet their full yearly family subsistence requirements instead
of the eight to nine months as at present; attainment of this objective
would assist in controlling the spontaneous settlement in lowland forests
by large numbers of marginal farmers from the Hills. In addition, imple-
mentation of the project will provide or improve health services, water
supplies, tracks and trails and erosion control affecting all families living
in the project area. Productivity of cottage industries and the administrative
infrastructure would also be improved and strengthened within the districts.
33.       Technical assistance would be provided under the project to develop
programs for monitoring and evaluating the effects of this project and to
prepare a further rural development project. An irrigation engineer and
administrative support for overall project management would also be provided.
34.       With the exception of cottage industry outputs, almost all in-
creased production from the project area would be consumed on the farm to
meet subsistence needs, or sold or bartered in nearby villages for other
essential ingredients of family diet. However, some grain surpluses, winter
vegetables and dairy products would be available for marketing. Approximately
48% of the total project cost would be addressed to components directly or
indirectly affecting the increased farm and cottage industry production and
40% to social and infrastructure components. The remaining 12% would be
applied to project administration, evaluation and technical assistance. Spe-
cifically, the proposed project consists of the following production, social,
and infrastructure components:
Farm Production Support
(a) Provide for the construction, staffing and equipping
of eight administrative sub-centers in the project
area to provide agricultural extension and livestock
support services, construction of a livestock market
in Nuwakot and, through the Agriculture Input Corpora-
tion, provide for the construction, staffing and
supplying of 16 farm input warehouses in the project area.
(b) Extend the reach of farming information services through
the provision of equipment for production of special
programs by Radio Nepal and of about 500 radios for use
by groups of farmers in the project area.
(c) Introduce improved varieties of crops and stock by estab-
lishing seed and livestock exchange programs together with
an annual program for the inoculation and dosing of buffaloes,
cattle, sheep and goats.



-9-
(d) Provide for the construction, equipping and operation by the
Dairy Development Corporation of a cheese and butter factory
with a capacity of about 1,000 liters at Trisuli Bazaar.
(e) Provide for the planting of about 2,500 ha of fodder and
fuel trees, regeneration of about 1,000 ha of fodder trees,
and the increased protection of an additional 5,000 ha of
forest. (Before beginning implementation of this component,
a 'forest resource and land use study will be completed; see
paragraph 56.)
(f) Provide for strengthening and expansion of agricultural
training and research through the construction of training
centers and upgrading the research facilities at Kakani,
Dhunche, and Trisuli Bazaar Research Stations.
(g)  Establish a district organization for irrigation in Nuwakot
and develop or improve the irrigation of about 1,900 ha
through a variety of approaches including small gravity-fed
schemes, hil.l terrace irrigation and high and low lift
pumping schemes.
(h)  Ensure provision of credit to farmers by the Agricultural
Development 13ank of Nepal (ADBN) through cooperative societies
and provide Eor the establishment, supervision' and auditing
of about 25 such societies to ensure 'speedy and efficient
provision of the credit.
(i)  In order to strengthen and expand cottage industries, provide
credit, training and additional administrative support,
together with construction of wool related processing
facilities.
Social and Infrastructure Support
(a) Construct, staff and supply 15 health posts in the project
area.
(b) Provide for construction and maintenance of 100 village
drinking water supply systems, together with the necessary
training for village technical,staff and maintenance
workers.
(c) Provide for construction of offices and' facilities, together
with appropriate staff training for about 60 village elected
bodies or Painchayats, and for the construction and equipping
of a district assembly hall in Nuwakot and in Rasuwa Districts.

(d)  Establish a Divisional Office of the Government's Department
of Soil and Water Conservation at Trisuli Bazaar to carry
out soil erosion control programs in the project area.
(e) Construct about 50 km of dry weather tracks and 12 small
suspension foot bridges, and improve about 100 km of major
trails and 75 km of minor trails.
Organization and Implementation
35.       While responsibility for implementation of specific components of
the project rests with designated Project Officers from the ministries and
agencies involved, 1/ overall responsibility for the coordination of project
planning and implementation will be vested in the Ministry of Panchayat (MOP,
the Ministry responsible for the working of an integrated village,district,
zonal and national system of administration) and will be exercisea by a Project
Coordinating Committee (PCC), chaired by the Secretary, Ministry ot Panchayat.
The PCC, which will be comprised of the designated Project Officers, will
set guidelines for implementation of the project, will be entrusted with
ensuring proper coordination among participating ministries and agencies, and
will review and monitor the progress of the project on a regular basis. The
Chief District Officers (see paragraph 37) from Rasuwa and Nuwakot will also
be members of the Project Coordinating Cormittee.
36.       There will be a Project Coordinator (PC) appointed from the
Ministry of Panchayat who will be a member of and secretary to the Project
Coordinating Committee. The Project Coordinator will advise and assist the
Districts and coordinate with the various ministries in developing detailed
plans and implementation schedules within the framework of the project
proposals. He will also assure the timely presentation of these plans to
the PCC for its consideration. The Project Coordinator will coordinate and
monitor the provision and use of project funds by the various ministries and
agencies and will assure that procedures required by the Association for
withdrawal of funds are complied with.
1/   The ministries participating in the project would be the Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Irrigation (agricultural
extension, research, training, irrigation and livestock development),
Ministry of Forests (reafforestation, regeneration and erosion control),
Ministry of Panchayat (project implementation, village water supplies,
trails, small footbridges, fuel and fodder plantations), Ministry of
Health (health posts), Ministry of Works and Transport (tracks, sus-
pension bridges), Ministry of Land Reform (guided cooperatives), and
the Ministry of Industry (cottage industries). In addition, the Agri-
cultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) (farm credit), the Dairy De-
velopment Corporation (butter and cheese plant), and the Agricultural
Input Corporation (farm inputs) will be represented on the Project
Coordination Committee.



37.       Execution of individual project components in the field will be
undertaken by local staff of participating ministries in coordination with
t.he village and district elected bodies (Panchayats) and under the guidance
of district administrative officers. This is in consonance with a recently
implemented reorganization in which HMG has created, in each district, a
District Secretariat headed by the Chief District Officer (CDO) and composed
of the local offices cf the various ministries associated with development
and administration. The development wing of the Secretariat is headed by
a Panchayat and Development Officer (PDO) who is primarily responsible for
the planning and impleamentation of programs by the district offices of the
ministries.
38.       Annual district planning begins with each concerned ministry or
agency providing the CDO of each district with appropriate technical guidance
and the amount of funds available for development within the project guide-
lines. The District Secretariat, with assistance from the Project Coordinator,
will prepare a district development plan in consultation with the district
Panchayat. Individual. components of the plan will then be implemented under
the direct supervision of the technical functionaries of the concerned minis-
tries, but under the-overall guidance of the CDO and with the support and
cooperation of the District Panchayat.
39.       Execution of a number of components of the Project, such as small
irrigation schemes, drinking water and track and trail development, will be
performed by the villages themselves with technical advice and support from
the district staff. 1Ministries, in providing budget and planning guidelines
to the CDO for their respective components of the project, will delineate
the roles of the district administration and village Panchayats.
40.       Monitoring of project implementation will be conducted on a day-
to-day basis by the PDO, under the. guidance of CDO. The Project Officers
from HMG ministries wLll ensure that the various project components under
their purview are being satisfactorily implemented. Quarterly and annual
evaluation reports submitted by the CDO to the District Panchayats and the
Project Coordinator will provide the basic monitoring documents. The Project
Coordinator will, in addition to the CDO's reports, obtain and compile
information from all.concerned ministries and agencies into quarterly reports
for submission to the PCC and IDA.
41.       An internati.onally recruited assistant to the Project Coordinator
would be provided under the technical assistance component to help to
develop procedures and expertise at district level in planning, budgeting
and project implementation. He will also assist in setting up systems tor
project monitoring, disbursement and accounting.
Cost and Financing
42.       Total project cost is estimated at $10.9 million equivalent (in-
cluding taxes and duties of about $312,000) consisting of foreign costs of
$4.9 million and local costs of $6.0 million. The proposed IDA credit of



- 12 -
$8.0 million would finance a foreign exchange component of $4.3 million
($0.5 million of foreign exchange to be financed under technical assistance)
and $3.7 million of local currency costs, or about 76% of total project cost
excluding taxes. Local currency financing is justified in Nepal for the reasons
cited in paragraph 12. UNDP is expected to finance $500,000 of the technical
assistance with the remaining $100,000 financed out of the IDA credit.
Technical assistance for this Rural Development Project is included in the
UNDP Country Programme for Nepal and has been given a high priority by the
Government. Signing of the UNDP Project Document or completion of some
equivalent arrangement would be a condition of effectiveness. The Government
would finance local costs amounting to 20% of total project costs excluding
taxes and farmers would contribute the remaining 2% through the seed and
livestock exchange program.
43.       IDA funds would be channelled to participating Ministries through
the MIinistry of Finance. The portion of the credit proceeds allocated to
agricultural credit (about 4% of the IDA Credit) will be on-lent to ADBN
at 7% for short term loans and 5% for medium term loans, equivalent to the
rediscount rate of the Central bank.   ADEN would, In line with present
policy, lend to cooperatives at 11% and 8%; the cooperatives would in turn
lend to farmers for short and medium term at 15% and 12%, respectively. Loan
spreads are considered adequate to meet the administrative costs of ADBN
and cooperatives.
Procurement and Disbursement
44.            Procurement of equipment, piping and vehicles involving contracts
above $50,000 would be by international competitive bidding in accordance
with IDA guidelines. Wvherever possible orders would be bulked. Orders of
less than $50,000 would be placed in accordance with 7-MG procurement proce-
dures which are satisfactory. Because of the remoteness of the project area
and small size of individual schemes it would not be practical to bulk con-
tracts for roads, tracks and bridges, erosion control, and irrigation devel-
opment and consequently these would be undertaken by the Ministry concerned
using local labor.
45.       The credit would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign exchange
costs of vehicles, pipes, equipment and mechanical plant or 63% of actual
cost if purchased locally; 63% of the cost of other locally provided equipment
and supplies, of local consultant services, of civil works, either performed
by local contractors or by government agencies, and of all loans made to
farmers; and 100% of the technical assistance costs covered by the credit.
The disbursement period would be five years.
46.       To expedite the initial detailed planning phase of the project,
retroactive financing not to exceed US$20,000 will be allowed for the forest
inventory and land use study to be undertaken by the Forestry Department.

Benefits and Justification
47.       The integrated approach of the project in providing production
and social services to a. remote and rural area will help develop a replicable
framework for further development in the Hill areas of Nepal.
48.       About 25,000 farm families, or about 85% of the families in the
Project Area, would directly benefit from agricultural, irrigation and live-
stock development under the project. The principal direct benefit to farm-
ers is increased food production which would enable them to meet their full
yearly family subsistence requirements instead of 8-9 months as at present.
Agriculture and irrigat'ion development would increase net crop incomes by
some 50% from about NR 630 to NR 960 per family on an average farm size of
0.4 ha. 1/ Annual production of paddy would increase 8,400 tons; maize
5,300 tons; wheat 1,600 tons; millet 200 tons; vegetables and potatoes 2,000
tons. Total increased value for local consumption would be NR 22.5 million
(US$1.8 million) annualLy at full development. Increased fodder production
and inoculation and dosing programs would result in increased milk, meat,
wool, hair and dung production by NR 900,000 annually.   Annual production
of butter (10 tons), cheese (80 tons) and milk (160,000 liters) would bring
,1R 220,000 on local markets.
43.       In addition to direct production increases, adoption oE improved
agricultural practices throughcut the project area wculd help reduce pres-
sures in the Hills to extend cultivation to marginal slopes and would re-
versa the present trend of declining crop yields. Such action would result
in ;ains of NR 115,000 annually from grain production which lwould otherwise
be lost.  Soil erosion control through prevention of landslides would hlelp
reduce the loss of agricultural land and the resultant production loss which
is estimated at NR 350,000 annually.
50.       On-farm development during the project period is expected to
reduce underemployment on farms but little additional hired labor would be
required. Project development of irrigation and erosion control, reforest-
ation, construction of water supply, tracks, trails and suspension bridges
would provide 30,000 MELn-months of unskilled and semi-skilled work. This
total is equivalent to 500 full time jobs over the total project period.
51.       Improved rural water supply would reduce the incidence of dysentery
and other water-borne diseases (estimated to presently affect nearly 30% of
children in the project: area).  Improvement of tracks and new suspension
bridges would enhance the communications and accessibility of the Project
Area. Furthermore, improvement of living conditions in the project area would
reduce migration and thus would help slow down spontaneous and uncontrolled
exploitation of lowland Terai forest.
1/   Incremental produce is valued at farm gate prices less incremental
fieancial costs.



- 14 -
52.       The Hll1 areas are food deficient with farms among the smallest
in the world. Although the project would raise agricultural production to
full subsistence levels, it would not generate substantial marketable sur-
pluses. Recovery of project investment costs in these circumstances would
not be practical, except in the Batar Irrigation scheme where water charges
will be imposed. The project must be regarded, in general, as a more
systematic redistribution of income by HMG as a contribution to the welfare
of the poorest section of the country. However, there would be savings to
HMG. When completed, erosion control activities in conjunction with the
Kathmandu-Trisuli Road would save an estimated NR 320,000 in annual road
maintenance costs. Increased foodgrain production from the project would
also save government subsidy and handling expenses presently involved in
shipping 200 tons of rice annually to Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. All
maintenance costs of irrigation and village water supplies would be borne
by farmers.
53.       Economic rates of return for the productive components of the e
project are 29% for agricultural development; 27% for minor irrigatlon
development; 16% for the Batar Irrigation scheme; 15% for livestock develop-
ment and 22% for erosion control and soil conservation. Taking into account
the cost of management and other investments which are not directly revenue
generating (i.e. Panchayat development, and track and trail and bridge
development), the economic rate of return to the project as a whole is 14%.
In developing this estimate, the costs of social services (health and water
supply), technical assistance studies and the land use study have been ex-
cluded. A 10% increase in costs would reduce ROR to 11%; and a 10% decline
in benefits combined with 10% cost increases would result in an ROR of 8%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of
Nepal and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
55.       A condition of effectiveness would be that the Government of
Nepal had made arrangements satisfactory to the Association for the
employment of consultants and technical experts required to provide
the necessary technical assistance (reference Article V, Section 5.01,
of the Credit Agreement).
56.       There are two conditions of disbursement.   (1) Prior to disburse-
ment of project funds for construction of irrigation facilities for the Batar
Plains, the Department of Irrigation, Hydrology and Meteorology would form



- 15 -
water user associations based on cadastral and sociological surveys; complete
the final design for this component; and establish to the satisfaction of
IDA the amount of and procedures for levying water charges (reference
Schedule 1, paragraph 3(b) of the Credit Agreement). (2) Until completion
of the Forestry Departmsent forest resource and land use study, project funds
for forestry would be dlisbursed only for purposes of that study (reference
Schedule 1, paragraph 3(a) of the Credit Agreement).
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Credit No. 166      Telecommunications Project US$1.7 million Credit of
November 10, 1969; Effective Date: February 26, 1970;
Closing Date:  July 31, 1974 - Revised Closin
Date: September 30, 1976
This was the Associations first project in Nepal. In the
early stages there was delay in setting up the Nepal Telecommunications
Board, later converted into a corporation (NTC), followed by delays in
obtaining expert assistance with consequent delay in procurement. There
have also been delays in civil engineering work. Satisfactory progress
has been made over the last four years and almost all the facilities to
be provided under this project are now in service about 2-1/2 years behind
schedule. Very real progress has been made in developing a satisfactory
organization for the sector and NTC showed its first profit in FY 1974.
Credit No. 223      Flighway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21,
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing
Date: June 30, 1975 - Revised Closing Date: December 31,
1976
With a delaty of about eighteen months, the last of the five proj-
ect road bridges is nearing completion and all are expected to be open early
in 1976. The delay wras principally due to land acquisition difficulties
and a national shortage of cement and fuel. Three of the five porter sus-
pension bridges are open, with the remaining two to be opened in 1976. All
project road maintenance equipment has been received and is now part of
the Road Department fleet. Equipment workshop construction has been slow
due to contractual difficulties stemming from price escalation; however,
workshop constructiorL should be completed in the first half of 1976. Bid
prices, although above appraisal estimates, are within contingencies. Total
project cost is approximately 11% above appraisal estimate. In view of the
effect of general inflation on the benefits, this is not likely to affect
the rate of return. The project is expected to be completed by mid-1976.
Credit No. 291      T'ourism Project US$3.2 million Credit (Net of Cancel-
lation) of March 22, 1972; Effective Date: November 9,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975 - Revised Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineering
and project management consultants, and repeated changes in scope proposed
by the sponsors of the subprojects, the project is two years behind schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects, irL execution and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken. They should
be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Construction of the Yak and Yeti subproject is underway and is expected to
be completed by the end of 1976. On the other hand, it was not possible to
reach a firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revision of the
Annapurna subproject, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled from the
original allocation ($2.88 million) for that subproject. The remaining
$1.88 million to meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti subproject and
to finance feasibility studies for further tourism facilities outside the
Kathmandu Valley.
Credit No. 373      Birganj Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project was initially delayed by Government's
delay in appointing consultants for detailed engineering and construction
supervision, slow field surveys and procurement difficulties. Contracts to
the value of 20% of the total under the project have been awarded. After a
slow start, present progress is satisfactory. Cost overruns are being met
by reducing lower priority items. The project remains viable in view of
increase in agricultural commodity prices, and is expected to be completed
by mid-1978.
Credit No. 397      Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior
management and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been
delays in procurement and the project is at this stage about 12 to 18
months behind schedule. Good progress is now being made with the assis-
tance of consultants and experts provided through ODM and present estimates
allow for completion by December 1979, about 6 months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470      Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$7.8 million Credit
of May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
The Water Supply and Sewerage Board was established and work on
the project started with minor delay. Project implementation is now proceed-
ing satisfactorily with approximately 20% of the contracts awarded. Because
of recent price escalations, cost overruns are expected which will be partial-
ly met by financing the technical assistance component of the project through
UNDP grants. The project is expected to be completed by June 1978.
Credit No. 505       Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14,
1974; Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing
Date: July 15, 1982
Project implementation is more than a year behind schedule due to
delays in signing and making the credit effective. Subsequent delays were

also encountered in preparing bidding documents, which required more intensive
supervision and assistance by Association staff. Procurement is being speeded
up, and bids for variou.s types of equipment have been received and are being
evaluated by the Goverament.
Credit No. 600      Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit
of January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 10, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981

Procurement
Arrangements      (a)  Procurement of equipment (US$7S0,000) piping
(US$760,000) and vehicles (US$520,000) involving
contracts above US$50,000 would be by international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines. Wherever possible orders would be bulked.
Orders of less than US$50,000 would be purchased
under 1MG procurement procedures whichi are satis-
factory.
(b) Because of the remoteness of the project area and
small size of individual schemes, it would not be
practical to bulk civil works contracts for roads,
tracks and bridges (US$1.3 million), erosion control
(US$914,000) and irrigation development (US$650,000)
and consequently these would be undertaken by the
ministry concerned using local labor.
(c) With the exception of the regional training center
and district Panchayat halls (US$100,000) all
buildings (US$900,000) would be constructed by the
District Building Division, as they would be widely
scattered and constructed over a number of years
using largely local materials. Construction of
the training center and halls would be subject to
local competitive bidding.
Disbursements       Disbursement of Funds would be on the following basis:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for vehicles, piping,
equipment and mechanical plant or 63% of total cost
for these goods if procured locally.
(b) 63% of other project costs including: the local
costs of equipment and supplies purchased locally;
local consultant services; civil works either
performed by local contractors or by government
agencies; and of all loans made to farmers.
(c) 100% of technical assistance costs.
(d) To expedite the detailed planning of this project,
retroactive financing not to exceed US$20,000 will
be allowed for the forest inventory and land use
study to be undertaken by the Forestry Department.

Technical
Assistance        The following technical assistance personnel (financed by
UNDP and the IDA Credit) would be recruited:
(a)' An assistant to the Project Coordinator would develop
procedures and expertise at district level in project
implementation and would assist in setting up systems
for project monitoring, disbursement, and accounting.
(b)  An irrigation engineer would help train district staff
in implementing new and improved irrigation systems
and in training farmers in their operation and
maintenance.
(c) Consultants would be required to develop satisfactory
procedures for evaluation of the socio-economic impact
of the project on participants and to analyze data
collected throughout the project period.
Cd) Consultants may be employed by the Project Coordinator,
if needed, to resolve issues not apparent at the time
of project appraisal.
(e) Consultants would be responsible for data collection
for the preparation of a further rural development
project.
