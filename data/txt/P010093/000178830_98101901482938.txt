NOTES:
1.  Assumptions on Field Work crews are:
(a)  Present land use survey requires four forestry cr4is and one soil
survey crew.
(b) Each field work and land survey crew consists of J
(i) one gazetted officer (Rs. 80/day for field & walking
allowance) and
(ii) one non-gazetted officer (Rs. 55/day for field and
walking allowance)
(c) Only field and walking allowance has been charged to field surveys.
2. Aerial photography assumes we can get British team assistance; if not
available, this item should be added to helicopter updating.
3. Items 1 and 3 above have to be done by June 1976.
4. No charge for Preparation of Management plan since existing staff is used
and no field work required.

B. PUMPING COSTS
2.0 mcm lifted 70 meters. Pumps produce 280 lps =
= 280 x 3600 = 1000 m3/hr, i.e. in average year they
will run 2000 hours. They draw about 88 kw each x
x 4 = 352 kw. Over 2000 hrs they will then consume
704,000 kwh at Rs 0.10 per kwh this would cost                      70,400
To Batar - where no rice can be grown because of
soil conditions - they will lift 250,000 m3 a
further 26 m.  This will take another 32,500 kwh =                   3,500
Total Power Costs      Rs   73,900
Say     Rs   74,000
For 1.8 mcm delivered this amounts to Rs 0.041 per m3.
C. CAPITAL REPAYMENT
If HMG lends to water user association at 1%
interest, with 10 years grace and 50 years to
repay:
Capital Cost = Rs 4.4 million
After accumulating 1% p.a. service charges,
amount at 10th year will be:
4.4  x 1.105   =   Rs  4.86 million
This, repaid over 50 years, would require
annual payments of:
4.86  x  0.0255  =  Rs  124,000/year

1/ This is what the power to lift  1 m3  of water will cost. To ensure water
economy the variable charge may be greater, say Rs 0.05/m3 and the flat
portion less.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
Benefits
1.        Quantifiable benefits attributed to agricultural development are:
(a) The value of incremental crop production; and
(b) savings in production losses without the project.
2.        The phasing of cropped area under the agricultural development
component is given in Table 1. The value of per ha incremental yields for
each crop are presented in Annexes 15 and 16. Total incremental value of
production from agricultural development is given in Table 2.
3.        Extension of the maize production package under the project (Annex
15, para 4) should reverse the trend of declining yields (1% annually). The
value of maize production >(NR 19.8/ha) 1/, which would otherwise have been
lost without the project, is computed only for the areas benefiting from the
improved seed exchange program. No attempt is made to quantify probable
yield savings for millet since an improved production package adapted to
average farm conditions is yet to be developed.
Costs
4.        Incremental farm costs are computed from the phasing of cropped
area (Table 1) and the economic costs per hectare for each crop (Annex 20).
Economic costs include the valuation of livestock manure at NR 15/ton
(Appendix 3, para 1) and unsubsidized input costs.
5.        Incremental investment costs include capital and operating costs
during the project period (year 1 - year 5). Horticultural marketing and
agricultural research costs are included in the rate of return calculations
although no quantifiable benefits can be estimated. One-third of the agri-
cultural training costs are expected to benefit non-project participants in
1/   1% of 1.8 tons/ha is saved annually at Rs 1,100/ton.

the regional training center. Hence only two-thirds of training costs are
charged to the project. Project co-ordinator's responsibilities may be
prorated equally over seven sets of project components of which two sets
are classified as agricultural development. Project coordinator costs
have, therefore, been prorated at two-seventh of the total. Incremental
costs after year 5 includes residual staff (and allowances) in the project
area, continuing maintenance of offices and buildings and replacement of
residual vehicles.
Results
6.        The economic rate of return from agricultural development is 29%.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION
MINOR IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
Benefits
1.        Incremental production from each irrigation scheme is given in
Annex 3, Table 13. The benefits from irrigation are reflected in yield
improvements on existing cropped areas, changes in cropping pattern and
increased cropping density.
2.        The Phasing of cropped areas by:  (i) improvements on existing
cropped areas, and (ii) introduction of new cropped areas, are given in
Table l. Incremental yields from improved irrigation and fertilizer use
are given in Annex 15, Table 2. The significantly higher value/cost ratios
from fertilizer use associated with improved varieties and irrigation
(Annex 15, Table 3) Justifies the inclusion of fertilizer use by irriga-
tion beneficiaries for early paddy, monsoon paddy, maize, wheat, potatoes
and vegetables. Phasing of incremental benefits for each type of irriga-
tion scheme undertaken by the project is given in Table 2.
Costs
3.        Incremental farm costs (Table 3) are computed from the phasing of
areas cropped (Table 1) and the economic costs per ha for each crop (Annex
16). Incremental investment costs include capital and operating costs dur-
ing the project period. Technical office costs are pro-rated at half the
rate since it is also used for track and trail development. Project co-or-
dinator costs are pro-rated at one-seventh of total (Table 4).
4.        Incremental investment costs are also estimated for each type of
irrigation scheme with overhead costs (technical office, expatriate) pro-
rated according to the acreage of each scheme (Table 5).
Results
5.        The overall economic rate of returns from minor irrigation
development (27%)., is lower than the agricultural development rate parti-
cularly because of the following additional items for irrigation evaluation:



- 94 -
ANNEX 17
Appendix 2
Page 2
(i) expatriate cost; (ii) inclusion of technical office costs; and (iii) higher
shadow wage rates for family labor for winter season cropping (NR 5 instead of
NR2/man day).
6.        The best estimates for the economic rate of returns from each scheme
(pre-devaluation) is given below:

2.  Hill Terrace Irrigation                   28%
3.  Simra Pump Scheme                         25%

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
Benefits from Livestock Development
1.        Inoculation and Dosing.  Of an estimated total cattle and buffalo
population of 84,000, the inoculation and dosing program is expected to
reach only the productive or potentially productive animals. 1/ The impact
of this program is expected to reduce the mortality of beneficiaries from
the existing 8% to 5%. This 3% reduction in mortality may te conservatively
translated into the saving of NR 75,000 in potential animal milk production 2/
from the fifth year of the project. No direct benefits are attributed to
the savings of work oxen because of the difficulty in assessing their aver-
age productivity. Direct benefits can, however, be attributed to the manure
derived from the animals saved. Since the collection of dung is usually
done for stall-fed female buffaloes, the value from the 630 female buffaloes
saved annually is estimated to be NR 37,800 3/ from the fifth year.
2.        Incremental benefits from inoculation and dosing tf sheep and
goats arise from the reduction of lambing losses for about 35,000 lambs
or kids born annually. 4/ Lambing losses can be reduced from an average of
22% 5/ to 11%, resulting in the saving of about 3,800 heads per year. The
1/   Of the 34,000 female buffaloes and 23,000 lowland cows above the age of
one year, and 21,000 mature lowland oxen in the project area, inocula-
tion is expected to reach the more productive 43,000 head as follows:
21,000 female buffalo, 14,000 lowland cows and 8,000 lowland oxen.
2/   Beneficiaries saved (3%) from mortality reduction would be 1,000 head
(excluding 500 oxen). Assuming half of these are in milk each year,
the annual production value saved (weighted average yield per head
is 300 liters at NR 0.50/liter) is NR 75,000.
3/   On average, 4 tons of manure are collected per head.  Valued at NR 15/
ton (75% of the existing market rate), total savings per head is NR 60.
4/   Lambing percentage from 50,000 adult female sheep and goats is estimated
to be 70%.
'jf Lambing losses for sheep - 60%, goats - 15%. Ratio of sheep to goats,
= 1:5.

stream of potential benefits, thus saved would be from: (a) the net return
from male lambs/kids which are are normally sold fdr meat and wool/hair be-
tween 12-18 months; and (b) replacement of the other unproductive females
by the female lambs or kids. Quantification is only attempted for the net
returns from meat and wool/hair sales. At 15 months, the average carcass
weight of each goat/sheep sold is 15 kg; the weighted average weight of
wool/hair is 0.8 kg. 1/ Therefore, potential income streams from 1,900
heads saved annually would be NR 200,000, from meat (at NR 7/kg) 2/ and
NR 13,000 from wool/hair (at NR 10/kg).
3.        Cheese and Butter Development.  The owners of about 730 female
buffaloes (each producing an average of 500 liters/year) are expected to
benefit from the full development (year 3) of the DDC cheese and butter
plant in Trisuli Bazaar. The primary benefit will be: (a) the incremental
price (NR 0.1/liter) obtained by the farmer in substituting fresh milk sales
for ghee processing; 3/ and (b) the value added in cheese/butter processing.
4.        The net benefits from the collection of 1,000 liters daily is
estimated at NR 401,100 per year. The value added in cheese/butter pro-
cessing is estimated at NR 0.6/liter of fluid milk equivalent. 4/
5.        Fodder Tree Development.  Harvesting from fodder trees begin on
the fifth year after planting. At full development (tenth year), inicremen-
tal production from a hectare of trees is estimated to provide sufficient
fodder for four milking buffaloes (Annex ..). The average milk production
from a hectare would be 1,000 litters or NR 1,120 annually. 5/ The value of
dung would be NR 240/ha 6/ annually.
1/   The average weight of wool and hair per head is 1 kg and 0.7 kg respec-
tively. Ratio of goats to sheep in the project area is 5:1.
2/   This is the farm price (NR 10/kg) net of maintenance cost for 15 months
(NR 3/kg).
3/   The equivalent fluid milk price for each liter of milk converted to
ghee is NR 0.7 compared with NR 1.7 under the milk delivery scheme
for the cheese/butter plant.
4/   Estimated DDC costs (per liter fluid milk equivalent) are:  Procure-
ment price = NR 1.70; operating (including transportation) costs =
NR 1.69. Sales value (per liter fluid milk equivalent) is NR 3.90.
5/   400 liters per head at NR 0.70/liter, or, NR 280/head of NR 120/ha.
These buffaloes are expected to be less productive than those on the
milk scheme.
6/   4 tons per head at NR 15/ton, or NR 60/head or NR 240/ha.

6i.       Because of the difficulty of assessing incremental benefits, sire
exchange costs are excluded from the analysis on the assumption that bene-
fits are equal to costs.
Livestock Development Costs
7.        Livestock development costs include capital and operating costs
during the project period (year 1 - year 5) and pro-rated costs of the pro-
ject co-ordinators office. Costs after year 5 includes resitlual staff and
allowances in the project area, continuing maintenance of offices and
buildings, replacement of residual vehicles and ongoing maintenance of fodder
plantations.
Economic Rate of Return
8.        The economic rate of return from livestock development is 15%.

SOIL EROSION CONTROL COMPONENT
Benefit
1.        Direct (quantifiable) 4enefits from soil erosion (Table 1) are:
(a) savings in annual road maintenance costs;
(b) prevention of agricultural land losses around
gully control structures; and
(c) benefits from reforestation and soil conservation
of denuded areas.
2.       IIMG presently spends about NR 10 million annually in repairing
750 km of mountain roads damaged by landslides and river damage. An
equivalent annual repair cost (NR 13,333/km) may be assumed for the
Trisuli-Kathmandu Road as its terrain is at least as difficult. For
the 72 km Trisuli-Kathmandu road, annual repair costs are estimated at
NR 960,000. Assuming (i) half the repair costs (NR 480,000) are for
improving the road, and (ii) proposed soil erosion works can only
control two-thirds of annual landslides, the savings in annual main-
tenance is estimated at NR 320,000 when the erosion control works are
completed (year 5).
3.        Control of gulley erosion (eg through check dams) prevents losses
of agricultural land on hillslopes. Under typical hill conditions, each
minor gulley, if unprevented, would cause a loss of 1 ha of agricultural
land within 10 years or an equivalent of 0.1 ha progressively each year;
for each medium gulley, the loss is 2 ha within 10 years. The phasing of
gullies under the project are: year 2 - 3 minor and 1 medium; year 3 - 11
minor and 2 medium; year 4 - 19 minor. The value of each hectare of hill
land saved, is taken as the average net income foregone 1/ ahnually from
maize cultivation.
1/   From Annex 20, Table 1, each hectare of maize land (high altitude)
yields a net economic income (Total Revenue minus economic farm cost)
of about NR 900 each.

ANNEX 17
Appendix 4

4.        Reforestation on denuded slopes and among gully control works will
produce an annual increment of 6m3/ha of fuelwood annually. With a rotation
period of 15 years, wood can be harvested from the seventh year after estab-
lishment. With 26.5 ha to be established, and fuelwood for I4athmandu valued
(on site) at NR 150/m3, annual benefits at full development would be NR 23,900.
5.        Other benefits from erosion control and soil conservation which
cannot be readily quantified are:
(a) reduction of erosion dangers, flood run-off and silt load
effects on valleys below erosion works;
(b) reduced siltation of the hydro-power balance reservoir; and
(c) benefits from the protection of other project infrastructures
(eg gravity canals) in the form of reduced repair costs and
protection of agricultural land.
Costs
6.        Annual incremental investment costs (detailed in Annex 11, Table
27) include incremental capital and operating costs.
Results
7.        The economic rate of return (ROR) from investments in erosion
control is 22%.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation - Batar Irrigation
Benefits
1.        The benefits attributable to the components of the Batar Project
included here are strictly the incremental value of crop production on the
154 additional hectares to which irrigation will be provided under this
project.
2.        The phasing of development and resulting incremental values of
agricultural production (based on the details presented in Annex 20) are
given on page 2 of this Appendix.
Costs
3.        Capital investment and annual costs are as detailed in Annex 11,
Tables 47 and 48. The costs of the pumping facilities already installed by
HMG are excluded (as are the benefits from the 86 ha which would have been
irrigated without the extensions-made possible under this project).
4.        Electric energy costs have been priced at the financial rate of
Rs 0.10/kwh, as examination of load growth and generating capacity in the
Central Grid indicates there may be several years prior to bhe commissioning
of the Khulikani Project (about 1980/81) when there will be real economic
costs associated with pumping for Batar Irrigation. For most of the life
of the project, however, it will be possible to restrict pumping to hours
during which water otherwise be spilled past the Trisuli  4eoJl*ctric Plant,
so that the energy used will have virtually zero economi4r-
Results
5.        The economic rate of return resulting from extending the Batar
Irrigation System from the present 86 to 240 ha is 16%.
