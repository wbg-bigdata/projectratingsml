FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1929-ME)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Railway
Project in Mexico, for which Loan 1929-ME in the amount of $150.0 million
-was approved on December 15, 1980. The loan was closed on June 30, 1986,
two years behind schedule, when US$149,880,712 was disbursed and an
undisbursed amount of $119,288 cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Country Department II (Preface,
Evaluation Summary and Par.3 I and III). On May 18, 1990 the Bank sent the
Borrower Parts I and III with the request for comments additional to those
already included in this report. These are now incorporated as Part II.
This PCR is based, interalia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements; Supervision Reports; correspondence between
the Bank and the Borrower; internal Bank Memoranda, reports/data received
from the Borrower, and information available from the Project Files.

FOURTH RAILWAY pROJECT (LOAN 1929-ME)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUJ5ION SUMMARY
Obiectivel
1.-      The main objectives of the project, the improvement of the
operations and finances of the railway (para 3.01) were, in a large measure
achieved. Traffic carried by NdeM increased substantially, although not to
the extent forecast at appraisal. This, together with significant tariff
increases during the project period, and several improvements in key areas
of NdeM's operations, reduced the railway's deficits substantially and
improved the Operating and Working Ratios of NdeM-almost in line with the
targets indicated at appraisal (para 6.01).
Implementation and Results
2.       Implementation of the project was adversely affected by the down
turn in Mexico's economy arising from the fall in oil prices and the
substamcial devaluation of the Mexican peso (para 5.02). As a result of
the austerity measures imposed, and also because traffic increases were
lower than forecast, the project investments were reduced and spread over
five years instead of the three years of thie original project (para 5.02).
However, the implementation of the project was competently done, and the
project was implemented at a cost approximately 20% lower than the
estimated cost (para 5.03). The re-evaluated Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
of the project is 25% compared with 22% de.termined at Appraisal (para
6.08).
Sustainabilitv
3.       The project had significant benefits inasmuch as the operational
and financial performance of the railway improved, while at the same time
an increasing amount of traffic was carried by NdeM thus avoiding diversion
of bulk long distance traffic to the road where unit transport costs for
such traffic are hieher. The satisfactory performance under this project
and the basic charieteristics of the project, as a time-slice of an agreed
investment program with a specific action program paved the way for
appraisal of the Railway Sector Project as a follow up operation designed
to further improve the performance and carrying capacity of NdeM, and to
enhance its contribution to the Mexican economy. The Fourth Railway
Project, therefore, is likely to maintain an acceptable level of nst
benefits throughout its economic life.
Findines aLg lessons Learned
4.       Basically, the project produced -the expected results because the
various project components and the Plan of Action were >..'sely linked to
performance results, and the borrower and the Bank respoz_._ed promptly and



- iii -
effectively to problems as they arose during the implementation of the
project. The progressive adjustment of the investments and the project
period averted over-investments, thus improving returns from the project.
One lesson that emerges from this project (and, for that matter, frnm
several other transportation projects) is that traffic forecasts shfuld be
more carefully done. The other, although reflected in the greater emphasis
on locomotive maintenance in the Railway Sector ?roject. is that this
aspect of the railway's work should be vigorously monitored by future Bank
missions. Finally, sustained efforts should be made to achieve cost-based
tariffs and to give FNdeK greater autonomy to adjust its tariffs (para
6.06).



MEXICO
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1929-ME)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. PART I PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.       Proiect Identity
Project Name: Railways IV
Loan No.:       1929-ME
RVP Unit:       Latin America and the Caribbean
Country:       Mexico
Sector:         Transportation
Subsector:     Railways
2.       Background
2.01     Mexico has developed an extensive transport network which
comprises over 200,000 km of roads, about 20,000 km of railways (all except
300 km being standard gauge), some 33 ports of which 13 serve international
traffic; about 50 airports capable of handling medium or larger size
aircraft; and over 20,000 km of pipelines for crude oil, refined products
and gas.
2.02     The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico were to (i) support
policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the benefits of
economic growth; (ii) help finance projects with significant contributions
to output and employment; (iii) help reduce Mexico's urban-regional
imbalances; and (iv) remove bottlenecks to economic growth. In regard to
infrastructure, the Bank focussed on investments in key areas, on
institutional reforms, and on sector policies to improve pricing
mechanisms, to generate additional resources for investment financing.
2.03     The Bank has provided broad support to the development of
transport in Mexico, zo improve planning ard administration, with mixed
results in the highways sub-sector and a greater degree of success in the
railways sub-sector. For the railways, three loans helped to rehabilitate
the infrastructure and improve operations, but the Covernment had been slow
to act on tariff increases, although by the end of the third loan, an
increasing awareness of the problem had become perceptible. The good
relations established between the Government NdeM and the Bank and the
general compatability of objectives meant that the size of the Bank's
contribution to NdeM investment program financing was not a critical
determinant of the level of cooperation enjoyed.
2.04     At the time this project was appraised, transport demand was
expected to increase by 8% annually and with the Governm at's strategy of
integrated regional economies, the demand for land transport was expected
to affect the railways which would require judicious investments to expand
their carrying capacity. A Bank mission in May 1979, referred to as the
'Transport Bottlenecks Mission' which visited Mexico at the request of the
Ministry of Finance (SHCP), concluded that five years of real reductions in



-2-
transport sector investments coupled with a surge in economic growth and
large food-grain imports had led to serious bottlenecks in the rail system
(with the Ports, at the time, a secondary problem). The mission
highlighted the need for substantial investments to improve rail capacity
which could be well justified and of high priority. A series of
preparation missions visited Mexico in the second half of 1979 and early
1980 to prepare che project, which was appraised in May 1960.
2.05     During the preparation of the project, 1ldeM and SCT discussed the
prospects of a Railway Sector Loan which would include not only NdeM's
investments but also SCT's program of construction of new lines and
realignment of some of the older lines to reduce the curvature and
gradients. This would have neces3itated a Sector Loan format, as four
different railway lines would be involved in the SCT program. On this
basis, the Appraisal mission went to the field with the mandate of
appraising a Railway Sector 2rojIct. However, dutrng Appraisal, SCT
conveyed that it would not seek Bank funding for its investment program
from the Bank as it had found other sources of financing. It was the
perception at the time that the SCT was discouraged from participating by
the prospect of a critical review of its investments and also felt uneasy
with the Bank's interest in policy issues such as the aevel and structure
of tariffs. The project consequently concentrated on NdeM, and a classical
investment loan format was accordingly appropriate.
3.       Proiect Obiectives and Descrintion
3.01     The project combined the 1981-1983 portion of NdeM's 1981-1985
Investment Plan with a Plan of Action aimed at improving the operating and
financial performance of the Railway. The objectives were: (i) to augment
the carrying capacity of NdeM by continuing the rehabilitation of the
track, improvements in signalling and the acquisition of additional motive
power and rolling stock; (ii) to improve the operating efficiency of NdeM
in accordance with the targets set forth in the Plan of Action; (iii) to
reduce NdeM's operating deficits and to improve its financial position with
the objective of eventually reaching financial self sufficiency, and (iv)
to provide improved information systems for the management of NdeM.
3.02     The estimated cost of the project was $1,526.7 million with a
foreign exchange component off $535.8 million, of which $150 million would
be financed by the Bank loan. The main project components were:
(a) Rehabilitation of about 780 km of mainline track with new
rails, sleepers and ballast, and about 560 km of branch-lines
with second hand recovered rail, sleepers and ballast;
(b) Provision of track maintenance machinery and equipment to
accelerate and improve the maintenance of track;
(c) Strengthening and where necessary, replacement of old bridges
to carry heavier locomotives and freightcars for use on the
system;
(d) Lengthening of existing rail sidings and construction of
additional sidings, where necessary, to augment line
capacity.



-3-
(e) Installation of centralized traffic control (CTC) on 960 kms
of principal lines;
(f) Acquisition of 192 mainline diesel locomotives, 50 shunting
locomotives and 9,350 freight cars;
(g) Replacement of old and obsolete workshop machinery and
equipment; and
(h) Technical assistance in the areas of (i) Cost of Services and
Tariff increases; (Li) Hanagement Information Systems; (iii)
Computerization of line and yard capacity analysis and
planning; and (iv) improvement of train and yard operations
and locomotive utilization.
3.03     The Plan of Action specified quantitative targets tn key
technical, operational and financial areas, to be met during the years
1981-1985, as well as the steps to be taken to achieve them.
3.04     The project was expected to be financed as follows:
NAFINSA                    $1,022.6 million
BANOBRAS                   $  284.1 million
OTHERS                     $   62.1 million
FOURTH RLY LOAN (IBRD)    $  150.0 million
OTHER BANK LOANS (IBRD)   $    7.4 million
$1,526.7 million
BANOBRAS was appointed as NdeM's financing agent.  Even though the
Government's share was small, it was expected to assume the debt service
charges on behalf of NdeM. Parallel financing was expected from Eximbank
(about $94 million) and international banks (about $127 million). through
NAFINSA, to finance the purchase of locomotives and to complete the
financial package of NdeM.
4.       Proie-t Design and Organization
4.01     The project was designed as an integrated program of technical,
economic and financial improvements, aimed at augmenting the carrying
capacity of NdeM and at improving its operations and finances. The
conceptual foundation for the project was thus clear, and was shared by the
Borrower and the-Government. The project content was conventional although
the combination of the investments and the extensive Action Plan was to
some extent innovative inasmuch as the inve3tments were related to
improvements in performance. The components chosen for loan financing was
determined partly by the availability and fungibility of other sources of
finance (Eximbank, etc) and by the comparative suitability of equipment
financing for the Bank. The project was well prepared and the roles and
responsibilities of the three main participants, NdeM, the Government and
the World Bank, were clearly defined.
4.02     Coordination of work in connection with the implementation of the
project was entrusted to the Planning Manager of NdeM, who coordinated the
work with the enecuting departments of NdeM and with the different agencies



-4.
of the Government. The cost and capacity analysis wing of the Planning
Office, in particular, played an important role in the identification of
problems and in making suggestions for cost savings and operational
improvements. Bureaucratic procedures made the coordination work difficult
and ic was on occasions necessary for Bank missions to play the role of
mediator in controversies between the different departments of the railway
or to expedite decisions and actions by sbe Government on subjects such as
tariff increases. However, by and large, the project was managed well by
the borrower, and despite the prodding that had to be done by the Bank
missions to get the Government to take tariff acrions, the overall results
of the project were good enough to justify the Railway sector loan in 1985
(pare 10).
5.       Proiect ImRlementation
5.01     Loan Effsctiveness and Proiect Start-up:  Board approval of tbe
loan was given en December 16, 1980, the legal documents were signed on
February 2, 1981 and the loan became effective on June 9, 1981. Between
loan signing and Effectiveness, there was a Bank mission to Mexico in May,
1981, to set up reporting requirements for the project, to expedite legal
actions required in Mexic.. to make the loan effective, and to supervise the
Third Railway Project, from which $15 million of the Bank loan still
remained to be disbursed. The year 1980 had been characterized by a huge
increase in the number of foreign freight cars on NdeM (from US), and at
one point this figure had reached 32,000, leading to P system-wide
congestion and deterioration of almost all the operating indices. Fuelled
principally by large scale ircreases in imports from US (mainly grain), it
was aggravated by cumbrous custom formalities at border check points,
unloading delays on the Mexican side, and inadequate yard capacity on the
US side. NdeM responded by (i) placing an embargo on US freightcars, (ii)
initiating construction of unloading facilities at delivery points and
(iii) by the imposition of punitive demurrage charges for delayed wagons.
On the suggestion of the Bank, the number of unit trains was substantially
increased, thus improving locomotive and freighecar utilization, and a
Joint Task Force was set up with US railroads for periodiic review of the
freightcar situation on both sides of the border. As a result, the number
of foreign cars in Mexico was brought down from a peak of 32,000 in 1980 to
about 12,600 by May 1981, with further improvements to follow in later
years (para 6.01). The Bank mission also finalized the Terms of Reference
for a study to review NdeM operations and to suggest steps to ensure that
with the additional equipment, rolling stock and line capacity works being
undertaken on NdeM railway operations were conducted in such a manner that
the best use was jade of the facilities, equipment and rolling stock
acquired.
5.02     Implementation Schedule:  Although the project as appraisee
comprised the 1981-1983 portion of the 1981-1985 investment plan, by the
time the loan be..ame effective it was already mid 1981. The second
supervisi4n mission from the Bank Li August 1981, however, reported fairly
good progress in project implementation. Traffic was increasing somewhat
in excess of appraisal forecasts. Significant improvements nad taken place
in the operations of NdeM (at least in part due to the 3rd Railway, Project
which was nearing completion), and the number of foreign cars had gone down
further to 9,300, thus easing the congestion and imprc.ing the fluidity of
the yards and mainlines. Some tariff increases had been made and although



-5-
these were still not sufficient to cover cost increases, NdeM's workir.g and
operating ratio improved (para 6.01) because of increasing traffic volumes
and better utilization of resources. Tha cost of service study was
completed thus providing the groundwork for future tariff increases. A
significant devaluation of the Mexican currency in February 1982 led to a
wage-hike of 20% in NdeM, and substantial increases in the cost of imported
matexials. This, accompanied by the fall in petroleum prices, led to the
imposition of stern austerity measures in the expenditures of all public
sector entities. For the NdeM, although the reductions in investment
expenditures for 1981 had been relatively tinocuous, these became quite
significant in 1982, with the result that a Bank mission was sent in March
1983 to reassess the investment priorities in the light of the budgetary
cuts imposed by the Government. The result was a deferment of some of the
expenditures.  In effect the project was spread over a larger number of
years, leading to a reallocation of loan funds in March 1983 and
postponement of the loan closing date (in July 1984) to June 30, 1985. In
June 1985, the loan closing date was further extended to June 30, 1986.
5.03     ZroiejjtCg=:  The estimated cost of the Fourth Railway Project
was about $1,52S.7 million (including contingencies), and it was to be
executed during the years 1981-1983. The final actual cost of the project,
in the years 1981-1985, was about $1,224.7 million as shown in Table SA
Part III. The foreign exchange cost was about $596.2 million as against
the Appraisal estimate of $535.8 million. The Bank loan contributed $150
million of the foreign-exchange costs. The local costs were $628.5 million
as against the $990.9 million estimated at Appraisal. Thus, in terms of US
dollars the actual project cost was about 80% of the SAR estimates, the
foreign exchange costs about 111% of the estimates and the local costs 63%
of the estimated cost. To a large degree these results reflecc the fmpact
of the exchange rate policies followed during the period of project
execution. The devaluations of the peso that took place (para 5.2)
resulted in a lower dollar equivalent for the local costs than had been
expected at appraisal. More specifically:
(i)    The Track program at $253 million cost 41% more than the
original estimate of $179 million for the track
rehabilitation works, bridges, _idings etc, mainly because
more work was done.
(ii)   The Signalling and Telecommunications works at $43.8
million cost 3% less than the SAR estimate of $45.2
million.
(iii)  The LocomotiVe and Rolling stock program at $898.4 million
cost about 13% more than the original estimate, because of
the additional purchase of spare parts added ln 1983.
(iv)   The Engineering and Supervision services at $28.6 million
cost 12% less than the SAR estimate of 32.4 million.
(v)    The consulting services at $0.9 million were only a
fraction of the original estimate of $4.0 million, mainly
because of the Government and NdeM's reluctance to use
foreign consultants and the fairly effective use of NdeM
"inhousew expertise for the studips and analysis (para 11).



-6-
Details of the proposed and actual financing of the project are given in
Table SB.
5.04     Pr2curement: Procurement of Bank-financed items proceeded on the
lines of the list of goods foreseen at appraisal, with the amendments as
made in 1983. As this was the fourth railway loan for Mexico and the third
one of NdeM (the first one having been for the Pacific Railway), the
railway had already acquired a degree of familiarity with the guidelines
for procurement under Bank loans, but in spite of this, bidding documents
had to be reviewed in the Bank with great care as intense worldwide
competition was involved in some of the major items such as rails, freight
cars, track machinery etc. In three major tenders the Bank did not agree
with and objected to the recommendations for award made by NdeM, but when
the Bank detailed the reasons for not agreeing with NdeM's recommendations
for award, NdeM was responsive and modified its recommendations to be in
accord with Bank guidelines. By and large, considering the complexity and
size of the tanders, and the multiplicity in the types of equipments and
spare parts purchased, the procurement work was very competently handled by
NdeM.
5.05     Disbgrsements:  Table 3 Part III indicates the estimated and
actual schedule of disbursements. $7.1 million was disbursed in FY1981 the
first financial y.ar of the project, $39.4 million in FY 1982, $13.5
million in FY 1983, $29.1 million in FY 1984, $16.7 million in FY 1985 and
$44.2 million in FY 1986. The original disbursement schedule forecast $14
million to be disbursed in FY 1981, $52 million in Fy 1982, $55 million in
Fy 1983 and $29 million in the final year FY 1985. The pace of
disbursements was considerably slower than the appraisal disbursement
schedule, mainly due to the financial stringancy faced by Mexico and the
expansion of the project to cover two additional years (para 5.02).  It is
interesting to note that the actual disbursement schedule was closer to the
standard disbursement profile for Mexico.
6.       Proiect Results
6.01     Proiect Objectives:  The main objectives of the project viz the
improvement of the finances and operations of the railway were, in a large
measure, achieved. The increase in the freight traffic carried by NdeH,
although lower than appraisal forecasts, was still substantial, and rose
from 55.1 million tons in 1980 to 60.4 million tons in 1985. The avevage
distance for freight traffic also increased from 606 km to 621 km in the
same period. This, together with the tariff increases made, improved the
Operating Ratio of NdeM from 171 in 1980 to 107 in 1985, thus meeting the
Bank targets. In 1984 the Operating Ratio at 91 bettered the Bank target
of 114. The Working ratios in the same period improved from 138 to 72
having p -:ed at 62 in 1984. There were also significant improvements in
opev.ations (Table 6A Part III). Most of the operating indices, excepting
locomotive availability (para 9), improved. The number of foreign ca_.. on
NdeM which had risen to a peak of 32,000 in 1980 was reduced to a little
over 4,200 by 1985, which not only eased the congestion on the NdeM, but
also reduced substantially the burden of rental charges paid to the US
railroads for the wagons detained at various yards and sidings in Mexico.
Locomotive utilization improved from 66,040 km per freight loco in 1980 to



.7
over 102,738 in 1985. Simultaneously average train loads increased from
1,276 tons in 1980 to 1,348 tons in 1985 while ton-kms per freight per day
increased from 1,470 in 1980 to 1,780 in 1985. Overall productivity in
traffic units per worker 1 improved from 586,000 in 1980 to 643,000 in
1985. However, the locomotives out of order position did not improve.
With a gradually increasing fleet of over aged locomotives (67% of the
fleet above 20 years of age, at the end of 1984), locomotive availability
remained at an unsatisfactory level, necessitating greater actention from
Bank missions during the later stages of this project and the development
of an integrated locomotive recovery plan during the appraisal of the
followup Railway Sector Project.
6.02     Phvsical Results:  In terms of physical compliance of the
components of the project, the various civil works and acquisition of
motive power, rolling stock, machinery and equipment etc., was done in
accordance with the pattern foreseen at appraisal, with the modifications
from year to year to fit the more modest traffic growth, and the expanded
time span of the project. A total of 938 kms of track were rehabilitated
in the five years 1981-1985 instead of the 780 kms in the years 1981-1983.
The number of bridges strengthened or replaced was about 640 instead of
510, and in addition, 217 culverts were also rebuilt or strengthened. In
signalling works, CTC was installed in 612 kIs instead of 960 kms,
postponing the remaining (Teotihuacan-Veracruz line) to the next railway
project.   The number of wagons purchased was reduced from 9,350 in three
years to 8,358 in five years, due to the slower growth of traffic. There
was, however, an increase in the number of locomotives procured, from 242
in 3 years to 317 in five years, mainly because of the scrapping of over
100 over aged locomotives during the project period, and the deteriorating
av-ailability of the locomotives in the face of increasing traffic (para
6.01).
6.03     Financial Performance:  NdeM's financial performance during 1981
to 1985 (tables 6C1 to 6C3 Part III) was much better than during the
previous seven years. The operating ratios not only showed substantial
improvement but surpassed the appraisal targets during 1983 and 1984 (1.16
and 0.89 versus the appraisal targets of 1.26 and 1.14). The Tripartite
Commission formed in 1979 comprising the Controller General of Accounts
(SCT), NdeM and NdeM's External Auditors to monitor Ndte's financial
performance has contributed substantially to major financial improvements.
Tariffs were substantially increased, almost 2,400 retired employees were
transferred to the Social Security System (Instituto de Seguro Social),
revaluation of fixed assets was reflected in the balance sheet and losses
on mail services were reduced. The freight and passenger service Cost
Study to guide management in the development of cost oriented tariffs was
satisfactorily completed. NdeK's compliance with financial covenants was
very good (Table 7, Part III).

-8-
6.04     The following comparative analysis indicates that tariff increases
during the 1981-85 period were higher than the inflation and NdeM's annual
wage increase per employee:
Freight Tariff            100%    154%    312%    655%    1,105%    1,933%
Increase (cum.)
Inflation (cum.)          100%    124%    194%    596%    1,015%    1,559%
Wages/Employee            100%    132%    225%    316%        502%    1,081%
6.05     In spite of encouraging financial trends, NdeM was not free of
problems.  The major devaluation of the Mexican peso, rising inflation,
increasing debt service obligations and increased depreciation accruals due
to revaluation of fixed assets caused the operating costs of railways to
rise by Mex$190.1 billion (from Mex$26.8 billion in 1981 to Mex$216.9
billion in 1985). Against these cost increases, revenues rose by Mex$183.8
billion. In late 1984 the price of diesel fuel went up from
Mex$22.62/litre tp Mex$27.13/litre. This triggered price increases of
other materials, further increasing railway costs. Consequently, the
operating ratio started deteriorating from 1985. Due to the devaluation of
the peso, debt service charges alone increased from Mex$11.0 billion in
1981 to Mex$94 billion in 1985, almost 50% of total revenue. As a result,
there were signs that NdeM's financial position was weakening again at the
end of the project period.
6.06     Although Government agreed with the Bank on introducing reforms
such as restructuring of tariffs in relation to costs, reducing/eliminating
uneconomic freight and passenger services, and compensating NdeM for
continuing serv.,.ce of the uneconomic passenger service, in reality, these
were not fully complied. The good performance on tariff increases compared
to the past was still on the basis of across the board increases, unrelated
to costs, in spite of having successfully completed the cost of service
study. The underlying rationale is believed to be that strict observance
of the cost based principle would have led to unacceptably high increases
for some tariffs and that a broadly based increase which was sufficient to
maintain a reasonable NdeM financial position was easier to implement.
Based on the lessons learned during this period of 1981-85, the remedial
actions that could be taken to avoid repetition and to improve NdeM's
financial condition, are as follows:
(i)    Tariffs should be cost oriented, should be adjusted in a
timely manner, should be based on economic criteria, and
should cover the long-run variable cost of each freight
commodity particularly for bulk commodities like iron ore,
coal, coke, limestone, cement and sugar cane; and
(ii)   The railway should have greater freedom to adjust its
tariffs without going through cumbersome political
procedures, and there should be flexibility to negotiate
tariffs with large customers, to enable the railways to
engage in a meaningful competition for freight with
truckers.



-9-
6.07     Economic Re-evaluation:  The project was justified at appraisal on
the basis of avoidance of diversion of rail traffic to road, where the unit
costs of transport are higher. There were three groups of investment to be
financed: (i) locomotives and rolling stock, which would provide additional
capacity to meet forecast demand; (ii) track and bridge rehabilitation and
replacement, which would increase efficiency through avoidance of high
maintenance costs and speed restrictions; and (iii) centralized traffic
control, which would increase line capacity by avoiding the delays
experienced with less sophisticated control systems. The economic rates of
return were expected to be 18%, 17% and between 32% and 40% for the three
groups, with an overall rate of 22%.
6.08     The Economic Re-Evaluation has been done using the same
methodology as in the SAR, and the re-evaluated ERR's are summarized in
table 6(B) Part III. Traffic did not increase as rapidly as forecast (para
6.01> and adjustments were made in the purchases of locomotives and rolling
stock not only for the lower traffic increases but also for such factors as
the poorer availability of locomotives, the accelerated scrapping program,
and the overall expansion of the investment program to spread over five
years instead of three. On the basis that the locomotive and freightcars
were, for whatever reason, necessary to carry a proportion of the traffic
which is equivalent to the share of the new rolling stock in total rolling
stock (about 15%) the revised ERR would be 30%. This compares with 18%
forecast at appraisal. The higher rate probably reflects the fact that
because the locomotives and rolling stock on-line at appraisal contributed
less than expected to freight traffic movement, and the new stock
correspondingly more, the benefits attributable to the new stock were
higher than expected per unit of investment.
6.09     For track relaying with new rail, the borrower has recalculated
the ERR as 24%. However, this calculation does not take into account the
appraisal assumption, which appears to remain valid that maintenance costs
with nev rail, initially low compared to those with the rail being replaced
would increase over a 10 year period with the consequence that the benefit
per kilometer of new rail would gradually decline in real terms. Adjusting
for this, the ERR is still acceptable at 19%.
6.10     For CTC (which was not financed from the loan, but was included in
the appraised investment plan) a problem arises in retrospective analysis
due to the long period (1979-85) over which investment took place and the
difficulty of establishing the magnitude of benefits during that period.
The borrower made the simplifying assumption that costs were incurred in
1985 and benefits started flowing in that year or later. On that basis,
the borrower established an ERR of 73%. Employing the more realistic
assumption that investments made prior to 1985 had an opportunity cost
equal to the opportunity cost of capital in Mexico (assumed as 12%)
increases the effective 1985 investment cost and reduces the ERR to a still
satisfactory 40%. The investment in CTC is a relatively small proportion
of the total and the choice of ERR makes little difference to the overall
project ERR. The overall project ERR is a fully satisfactory 25% compared
with 22% determined at appraisal.
7.       Project Sustainabilitv
7.01     The project had significant benefits inasmuch as the operational
and financial performance of the railway improved, while at the same time



- 10 -
there was an increase in the traffic carried by NdeM, together with a
significant improvement in worker productivity (para 6.01). The Mexican
railways, despite their low share of overall traffic (an estimated 14% of
all ton-kms or 23% of road and rail ton-km), have become crucial to the
efficient functioning of several sectors, carrying 40% of all beans, 30% of
all sorghum, 50% of all wheat and over 10% of all corn produced and
imported by Mexico. The railways are also principal carriers of iron ore,
coke, coal and sugar and are major carriers for fertilizers, cement and
many steel products. This, together with the improvements made during the
Fourth Railway Project, encouraged the Bank to appraise the Railway Sector
Project in 1985, to continue the augmentation of railway capacity and the
further improvement of its operating and financial performance. This
project coveres both the activities essential to operation of the existing
railway which are the responsibility of the rallway (NdeM later
incorporating the other three minor railways) end expansion of the system
through new construction and upgrading of structures which was in SCT
charge and is financed by a Bank loan of $300 million, and is currently in
progress. The fourth railway project therefore is likely to maintain an
acceptable level of net benefits throughout its economic life.
8.       Bank Performance
8.01     The project was the fourth in a series of operations to improve
the railway's capability and performance. It started prior to the end of
the third project and there was thus an overlap of almost a year between
the third and the fourth projects, and there was enough time to research
thoroughly the various components of the project. The Action Plan proved
to be a useful instrument for review of performance even though not all its
targets were achieved. The traffic forecasts at appraisal were, in
retrospect, too optimistic, partly because of the unexpected economic
downturn following the drop in oil prices, but at least in part due to the
railways' anxiety not to be caught short of capacity in the face of steady
increases in traffic over the past few years. However, over- investing was
avoided due to the pr-vision in the loan agreement for annual reviews.
Bank's insistence on the cost of service study to provide a technical basis
for the tariffs (section 5.05 of Loan Agreement) proved useful in providing
an intellectual basis for increasing tariffs (though the increases were
still across-the-board) which (coupled with traffic increases) caused the
financial position of NdeM to improve in accordance with the targets laid
down (paras 6.03 and 6.04). Supervision reports also indicate that
sustained attention was given by Bank missions to tariff issues, and
meetings with the Director General for Tariffs (in the SCT) were held
regularly, almost on every mission. However, although tariff increases
were substantial, the progress in revising the tariff structure was limited
because of governments' concern for holding down inflation. The Bank's
response to the changes following the imposition of austerity measures was
also prompt and effective, and led to important adjustments in the
investment program thus improving the returns from the project.
9.       Borrower Per2Lrmance
9.01     Railway affairs in Mexico during the Fourth Railway Project were
characterized by a remarkable continuity in the management of NdeM. r a
Director General of the Railway who was earlier been tlee President of :he
Labor Union, had managed the NdeM almost since the end of the Second



- 11 
Railway Project, with a remarkable absence of labor troubles and strikes
which had characterized the previous administration's regime. Except for a
few changes in senior management, most of the important managers, including
the managers for Planning (the coordinator for the project) and Procurement
continued right through the third and Fourth Railway Projects.  Some of the
key staff in the Planning Office received, on the suggestion of the Bank
missions, training in the Bank's Economic Development Institute (EDI).
There was thus a significant degree of understanding in respect of the
criteria for appraisal, implementation and performance under Bank-financed
projects. Despite this, there was, particularly during appraisal, and in
the period of "affluence" accompanying the rise in oil prices, a tendency
by NdeM to over estimate investment needs, necessitating a substantial
amount of pruning, not only when the project was appraised, but also
whenever the investment plans were reviewed. A succession of managerial
changes in the department of "Fuerza Motriz" resulted in lack of continuity
in the managemeuh. of locomotive maintenance and was an important
contributory cause of the decline in locomotive availability (para 6.01).
By and large, however, the project was managed well by the borrower, with
serious attention to the various project components, and a certain amount
of prodding by the Bank on sensitive issues such as tariff increases.
10.      Proiecg Relationshios
10.01    The continuity in NdeM management was also accompanied by an
exceptional continuity in the Bank team almost up to the end of the Fourth
Railway Project. This assured a productive relationship between the Bank
and the borrower, and the start of a dialogue with the Goverunent regarding
the Railway Sector Project, covering not only the investment programs of
both the SCT and NdeM, but also a closer and freer exchange of views on
policy matters.
11.      Consulting Services
11.01    The project provided for approximately $4 million in Consulting
Services of which $2 million in foreign exchange was to be funded by the
Bank loan. However, in keeping with a certain amount of reticence on the
part of NdeM expressed during appraisal, in regard to the employment of
foreign consultants, both the government and NdeM continued to have strong
reservations on this subject. The unwillingness to employ foreign
consultants was accentuated by the financial stringency imposed by the
austerity measures, and a growing capability in the Cost and Capacity
Analysis wings of the Planning office. As a matter of fact, NdeM did a
competent analysis of the Cost of Services and Tariff Structure, which was
the backup for tariff increases. NdeM also did a comprehensive "in-house'
study of the Manpower Plan which was a continuation of the efforts
initiated in the Third Railway Project and was responsible for improvements
in labor productivity (para 6.1). The study in regard to improvements in
operations and information systems was also done mostly "in-house," whereas
the work in regard to computerization of yard and line capacity work was,
in a large measure, included in the followup project. Summarizing the
effort in the studies, it may be said that three out of the four studies
were effectively done by NdeM wichout utilizing external help, and at
considerable savings, whereas a fourth study was in a large measure,
deferred for inclusion in the followup project. In retrospect, it would
seem that NdeM has sufficient technical and analytical capability to be



12 -
able to do most of its studies "inhouse", which in combination with a
certain amount of Bank guidance, and a minimum of external help in new
areas of activity, can be productive of satisfactory results, at the same
time contributinp, to a sense of accomplishment in the staff who perform the
work.
12.      Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01    The legal documents for this project were the result of evolution
over three previous projects and reflected a good compromise between the
concerns and interests of the Bank and the interests of the borrower and
the government. There was a considerable amount of discussion with the
government representatives during negotiations, over the Tariff covenant,
and although the borrower agreed to perform the Tariff Study, the
government did not commit itself to authorize the tariff increases
recommended by the study, "if the restructuring or increases sought by
Nacionales would be inconsistent with broader national or sectoral
objectives of the Guarantor...." (Sec. 3.02b of Guarantee Agreement). This
in a sense left the commitment open, as rnot always was there complete
identity between the Bank and the government in respect of the "broader
national or sectoral objectives." As a result, extra effort had to be made
by Bank missions to press for tariff increases which, it has to be said to
the credit of the Mexican Government, were made in the spirit of the
agreement and substantially in accordance with the requirements.
12.02    The periodic reports from NdeM were received regularly and the
report and data received from NdeM for preparation of the PCR has been
comprehensive, although lacking a critical assessment of the relationship
with the Bank or of the performance of any of the parties involved,
including cofinanciers.

FERROCARRILES NACIONALES DE MEXICO
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1929-ME
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF F.N.M.
INTRODUCTION
Within the developmental policies and guidelines established by
the Mexican Government in the 1980s, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico
developed an Investment Plan to increase the capacity to offer railway
transport services, with a view to support the country's economic growth.
This Investment Plan encompassed the period 1981-1985 with an
original amount of MEX$67,131.2 millions which, at the exchange rate of
MEX$23 per US$1 equaled US$2,918.7 million. The Plan covered the
comprehensive improvement of the railway company through rehabilitation and
modernization of the infrastructure and equipment as well as better
administration and operating procedures, which would be reflected in
improved operational and financial indicators, as well as contribute to the
sectoral and national goals.
As part of the above mentioned plan, a prioritary investments
project was established to be carried out during the period 1981-1982 with
an estimated cost of MEX$35,115 million (US$1,526.7 million). The
composition of these resources was estimated to be 65% in local currency
and 35% in foreign financing. In this mannei, loan requirements from
abroad reached US$535.8 million, from which US$150 million were obtained
through Loan 1929-ME granted by the World Bank. The rest of the financing
was obtained from other international financing institutions such as the
Eximbank.
The World Bank's Loan 1929-ME was approved on December 1980 and
became effective on February 12, 1981. It was originally estimated that
the project would be completed on June 30, 1984. However, because of
different conditions that at that time affected our country's economy, two
extensions were negotiated on the original completion date, thus, the
project was completed on August 30, 1986 (Annex V-6).
Loan 1929-ME provided an important support to the completion of
the above mentioned investment project, fostering the development of the
railways sector, and, consequently, of the Mexican economy as a wnole.
EXPECTATIONS OF FERROCARRILES NACIONALES DE MEXICO
WITH REGARD TO LO. 1929-ME
To partially finance the cost of the railway project 1981-1983,
Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico and the Federal Government deemed it
necessary to request the support of the World Bank through a loan which
would be basically used to acquire materials and import equipment such as:
new tracks and wagons, as well as to carry out studies and projects using
foreign consultants (Annex I-1).



- 14 -
As a result of negotiations carried out by the Government of
Mexico and Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico with the World Bank, the WB
granted FNM Loan No. 1929-HE in the amount of US$150 million, which
amounted to 28% of the US$535.8 million required by the original project in
foreign financing. With respect to total project cost--US$1,526.7 million-
-Loan 1929-ME contributed 9.8% of the total cost.
Within the Investment Plan 1981-1985, whose estimated cost was
US$2,918.7 million, composed by US$2,022 million from domestic financing
and by US$896.7 million from foreign financing, the loan granted by the
World Bank represented 5.14% of total requirements and 16.73% of foreign
credit needs (Annex I-2).
With the development of the Investment Plan 1981-1985 and,
specifically, with the execution of the Project 1981-1983 which included
the most urgent needs, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico expected to
perform works, at a minimum, to rehabilitate 782 km with new rails and 559
km with second-hand rails; improve the loading capacity of bridges and
major and minor structures, and expand the capacity of the main lines
through the improvement of grades, strengthening of embankments, and
improvement of radiocommunications and signaling system, as well as to
improve the facilities on yards, workshops, buildings and track equipment
fleet.
In the area of motive power and the wagons, it was estimated that
the needs included the acquisition of 242 locomotives, 8,650 wagons, 8,000
sets of axles and bearings, and the selective acquisition of machinery and
spare parts for the workshops.
The completion of studies, engineering, and supervision was also
considered important to support railway modernization (Annex III-5).
With all of this, it was expected t^ increase railway traffic from
33,400 millions of ton-km in 1980 to 40,500 million of ton-km in 1983, i.e.
21.3% equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 7.1%. For the period
1981-1985, the increase in traffic was estimated at 37.4% with an average
annual rate of 9.4% (Annex IV-3.2).
Thus, the improvement of infrastructure and equipment, as well as
in administration and organization between 1981-1983 and 1981-1985, were
expected to be reflected in substantially improved working and operating
ratios vis-a-vis those of 1989. The ratios, calculated according to the
agreements with the World Bank, would indicate the improvement of
Ferrocarriles with regard to financial soundness and pre4uctivity (Annex
IV-2).
In view of the above, FNM's expectations as to utilization of the
foreign credit, in general, and Loan 1929-ME granted by the World Bank, in
particular, were to achieve significant improvements during the period
1981-1983 basically through recovery of its installed capacity through
modernization. Its short run goal was to reach a higher degree of
development that would allow it to increase its participation in the growth
of the transport sector and support the country's economic development.



- 15 -
With all of the above, added to the relative advantage of World
Bank loans as to maturity terms, interest rates, and technical assistance,
Loan 1929-ME was to be an important contributor to the development of the
railway project herewith discussed.
REPULTS OBTAINED BY FERROCARRILES NACIONALES DE MEXICO
AS A RESULT OF LOAN 1929-ME
As to the physical results obtained by FNM during the periods
1981-1983 and 1981-1985, we feel that they have been adequately detailed by
the World Bank on parts I and III of the Project Completion Report.
In addition, FNM can state thac, notwithstanding the changes
registered in costs as well as in the targets and the original execution
dates agreed with the World Bank, in a qualitative analysis additional
benefits were obtained to those calculated in economic terms. Through
previous negotiations with the World Bank as well as in the relations
developed during the execution of the credit, experience was gained both in
the planning area as well as in the programming and control of investmerit
results. This experience is being applied in the short and medium term,
with a vision of what should be the Mexican Railway System in the future.
Likewise, the World Bank provided technical assistance and.
established controls to monitor the use of the loan proceeds and showed
understanding of the specific situations which could interfere at certain
moments with the original commitments, reviewing them and if need be,
modifying them. These actions make the financial relationship established
between this enterprise and the Bank to be considered of great support to
the development of the overall Mexican economy, leaving, as a result, a
railway transport system significantly improved vis-a-vis the situation
existing before the execution of Loan 1929-ME.
CONCLUSIONS
Completion of this project greatly helped the improvement of the
Mexican railway sector. In part, it made possible, during the period
1980-1985, the cargo traffic increase of 12.3% measured in ton-km from
33,400 million of ton-km in 1980 to 37,500 million of ton-km in 1985
(yielding an average annual rate of growth of 2.5%) (Annex IV-3.1).
As to the working and operating ratios, even though the original
projected figures were not achieved (Annex IV-2), by restricting the growth
in staff and increasing the volume of traffic (Annex IV-3.1), together with
implementation of the authorized rate increases (Annex V-4), the results
obtained were considered satisfactory. Account should be taken that our
country's economic situation was in a critical condition since 1981, which
brought about a strong devaluation of the Mexican Peso against the U.S.
Dollar, from MEX$23 per US$1 in 1981 to MEX$215.5 per US$1 in 1985. This
devaluation and the ensuing internal inflation reflected in considerable
increases of current expenditures and other factors such as the lack of
enough motive power reflected in a decrease of locomotive availability from
74.7% in 1980 to 62.7% in 1985 (Annex IV-1), as well as congestion of
foreign wagons on Mexican lines which became apparent since 1981, affected
the programmed objectives.



- 16 -
Notwithstanding the noted problems, the combination of authorized
rate increases and the larger traffic movement, produced unprecedented
increases in operational income, which grew almost eleven times during the
period 1981-1985. On the other hand, operational expenses grew only 8
times during the same period (Annex V-1).
The investments made during the analyzed period, partially
financed with the proceeds of Loan 1929-ME, generated economic benefits
which result in an internal rate of return of 30.5% for all of the
investments involved in the project (Annex VI-1).
In summary, we can state that execution of the project partially
financed by the World Bank allowed a substantial physical improvement of
the railway infrastructure and equipment, as well as better administration
of the company. As a consequence, we were able to ensure the necessary
transport capabilities to handle cargo generated by the development of the
Mexican economy. This was done notwithstanding the critical situation
faced by our country during the analyzed period.

1.  Track Rehabilitation                  17%               30%
2. Locomotive and

Overate Project                      22%               25%
Ass=mtions:
A/    The project was justified at appraisal on the basis of avoidance of
diversion of rail traffic to road where unit transport costs are
higher.
b/    Locomotives and rolling stock provided additional capacity to meet
increasing traffic demand.
S/    Track and bridge rehabilitation increased efficiency through
avoidance of high maintenance costs and speed restrictions.
W     Centralized traffic control increased line capacity by avoiding the
delays experienced with less sophisticated control mechanisms.
