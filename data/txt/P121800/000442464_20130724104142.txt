Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Development Objective of the operation is to support sector-specific, high-priority
policy and regulatory reforms that have been identified as critical to achieve Mexico's
climate change mitigation targets under the PECC for:
  (1) increasing renewable energy supply, promoting energy efficiency through
cogeneration, reducing gas flaring and venting;
  (2) improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport operations in
Mexico;
  (3) strengthening the market for energy-efficient housing; and
  (4) mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and forestry activities.

1.     Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Sector Context at Appraisal

Country Background and Macroeconomic Outlook

1.      The collapse of external demand in the last quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 led to
an almost immediate and severe economic downturn in Mexico. A subsequent rebound in external
demand in the second half of 2009 gave rise to an economic recovery. At the time of DPL
approval in late 2010, the level of GDP was still slightly below its pre-crisis level. The same was
the case for private consumption and investment, whereas the level of exports had returned to its
pre-crisis level and public expenditure never declined.

2.      Having maintained public expenditure during the crisis in spite of declining public
revenues, a fiscal stimulus of about 2.5 percent of GDP resulted. Beginning in 2010 a gradual
withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus was begun. In view of market concerns regarding fiscal
sustainability, Mexican authorities opted for initiating a program of fiscal consolidation by
increasing taxes and containing public expenditures. To moderate the withdrawal of fiscal support
and in line with Mexico’s fiscal responsibility law, the budget allowed for a deficit (excluding
budgetary investments in the oil sector) of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2010, which was expected to
decrease to 0.3 percent by 2011 and return to a balanced budget by 2012.

3.      Overall at the time of approval, the macroeconomic policy framework was deemed
appropriate for the proposed Development Policy Loan. Fiscal and monetary policies continued to
be well-managed in view of the challenges posed by the significant uncertainties about the
strength and sustainability of the global recovery and the volatility in global financial markets. No
major internal or external macroeconomic imbalances were building up or projected in the near
future.

Sector Background and Rationale for Bank Assistance

4.      As a dry and subtropical country lying between two oceans, Mexico is disproportionately
affected by climate change. Likely impacts include an increase in average and extreme
temperatures, a reduction in rainfall and changes in runoff patterns, and an increase in the intensity
of tropical storms from both the Atlantic and Pacific. In response, Mexico has had a strong record,
both domestically and internationally, of credible commitment and concrete actions to address the
challenges of global climate change. The creation of the Inter-secretarial Commission on Climate
Change (CICC) in 2005 was an early public signal of Mexico’s recognition of the threat of climate
change and the commitment of the Government to address it, and has been followed by additional
concrete plans and actions.

5.     The 2007-2012 Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (NDP or National Development Plan) had
environmental sustainability as one of its four pillars. Building on the national plan, the CICC
approved the Estrategia Nacional de Cambio Climático (ENACC or National Climate Change
Strategy) in May 2007. ENACC placed climate change adaptation and mitigation at the core of

                                                 1
Mexico’s national development policy, establishing the long-term agenda and setting medium- to
long-term adaptation and mitigation goals. In August 2009, the Programa Especial de Cambio
Climático (PECC or Special Climate Change Program) was published, establishing the
Government’s plan of action, including sectoral programs and targets for reducing greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, the identification of the principal climate change risks and plans for adaptation,
and cross-cutting policy initiatives.

6.      The FY2008-2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which the Board discussed in
April 2008, was fully aligned with the Mexican Government’s priorities as described in the NDP
and, as such, featured support for environmental sustainability, including climate change
mitigation and adaptation, as one of its pillars. The CPS Progress Report, which the Board
discussed in March 2010, reaffirmed this focus as a key element in the partnership. Engagement
by the Bank at the time of appraisal was intended to further the Bank’s support of Mexico’s
climate change program.

7.     The low-carbon DPL consolidated this support by focusing on multi-sector regulatory
reforms, standards, and institutional reforms that had been identified in previous operations as
necessary for meeting Mexico’s near-term climate change goals. Principal among these previous
operations was the Bank’s study on low-carbon development for Mexico (México: Estudio sobre
la Disminución de Emisiones de Carbono, MEDEC). Based on the findings and results of the
MEDEC study, this DPL developed a program that recognized and supported priority climate
change mitigation measures in key sectors of the Mexican economy – energy, transport, urban
housing, and forestry. The measures chosen were important for Mexico’s mitigation program, not
only because they have a large potential for reducing GHG emissions, but, as established in the
MEDEC study, because they were also cost-effective, implementable in the short-term, and
fundamental to fulfilling other sustainable development goals.

8.      Integrated Bank Strategy. Climate change is at the center of the Bank’s partnership
strategy, as indicated in the following figure. Bank support has included analysis and technical
support, investments and financing, and policy support, including sectorial policy initiatives such
as this Low-Carbon DPL. A DPL was chosen for this operation given the desire to link previous
analytical work with policy reforms in the climate change area, as well as prevailing
macroeconomic needs in Mexico at the time of approval.

1.2       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (at approval)

9.      The potential impacts of climate change are predicted to be severe for both industrial and
developing countries, and reducing greenhouse emissions can reduce the risk of the most
catastrophic impacts. Although many countries recognize the need to curtail carbon emissions,
there is considerable uncertainty about how much this will cost in individual countries, what
measures can be undertaken in both the short and longer term, and how cost-effective specific
interventions are in reducing emissions. In this context, the concept of “low-carbon development?
provides guidance on mitigation of greenhouse emissions without compromising economic
sustainability.

10.     The Policy Development Objective (PDO) of the Development Policy Loan was to support
sector-specific, high-priority policy and regulatory reforms that had been identified as critical to
achieving Mexico’s climate change mitigation targets under the PECC for:

         Increasing renewable energy supply, promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration,
          and reducing gas flaring and venting;
         Improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport operations in Mexico;
         Strengthening the market for energy-efficient housing; and
         Mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and forestry activities.

11.    The Government of Mexico has put in place a number of new laws and regulations that are
expected to help achieve the above PECC targets. While a previous DPL (“Green Growth? 2009)
focused on several key laws and national policies related to energy efficiency, renewable energy,
and public transport, this DPL identified specific sectorial regulations. The Prior Actions upon
which the policy areas included in this operation are based are presented in Box 1.

                    Box 1. Prior Actions for the Low-Carbon Development Policy Loan

The Government has implemented the following Prior Actions:

Policy Area 1: Cogeneration and Small-Scale Renewable Energy Development
     CRE adopted and published interconnection and net-metering regulations, and model contracts for
        cogeneration and RE-based electricity.

Policy Area 2: Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction
     National Hydrocarbons Commission adopted the Resolution to Reduce Gas Flaring and Technical
        Specifications for reducing gas flaring at Pemex.
     As a result of the issuance of the CNH Resolution, Pemex adopted a series of gas-flaring and recovery
        goals (Manifiestos) and submitted them to CNH.

Policy Area 3: Fuel Efficiency in Vehicles and Transport Operations
     SEMARNAT initiated the process for the creation of a standard for carbon dioxide (“CO2?) emissions
        and energy efficiency for new light duty vehicles.
     SEMARNAT and SCT established a Voluntary Clean Transport (VCT) Program to assist private
        long-distance passenger and freight operators and freight transport service users to improve the fuel
        efficiency of their operations.

Policy Area 4: Energy Efficient Housing Development
     CONAVI established a Sustainable Housing Program ( Programa Específico para el Desarrollo

                                                       4
         Habitacional Sustentable ante el Cambio Climático) to promoted energy efficient housing.

Policy Area 5: Sustainable Forest Management
     SEMARNAT published an agreement in the Diario Oficial de la Federación that modifies the
        regulatory framework for forest management activities, including the simplification of administrative
        procedures for forest management.
     SEMARNAT with the support of the Inter-Secretarial Commission for Climate Change created an
        internal Working Group to coordinate the development of a national REDD+ strategy.
12.      The sector-specific objectives, with key performance indicators, were the following.

13.      Energy Sector Objectives: The operation recognized and supported key regulatory changes
in the electric power and oil and gas sectors that allowed for the implementation of the Renewable
Energy and Energy Efficiency Laws of 2008 and the related regulatory, policy, and institutional
initiatives launched in 2009. Key performance indicators included:
      Policy Area 1 – Cogeneration and Small-Scale Renewable Energy Development
          The number of new cogeneration permits issued by CRE increases from 59 (2009) to
             70 (2012);
          The capacity of small-scale RE producers that are connected to the grid increases from
             25MW (2009) to 35MW (2012);
          At least 1 large-scale Pemex project complies with the new cogeneration rules.
      Policy Area 2 – Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction in Oil and Gas Production
          Pemex reduces total gas flaring for associated natural gas (excluding Cantarell) from
             195 MMCFD (2009) to 145 MMCFD (2012), and for Cantarell, gas flaring is reduced
             from 504 MMCFD (2009) to 47 MMCFD (2012).

14.     Transport Sector Objectives: The objective of the program in the road transport sector
was to recognize and support the Government’s creation of a regulatory framework and
incentives for increased energy efficiency and lower vehicle emissions. The main policy
measures and interventions in the operation included: (i) the establishment of a coherent set of
standards for fuel efficiency and emissions in new vehicles; and (ii) the operation of a program to
assist long-distance freight and passenger transport operators and freight transport service users
to enhance their fuel and environmental performance. Key performance indicators included:
      Policy Area 3 – Fuel Efficiency in Vehicles and Transport Operations
          By project end, it is expected that the fuel efficiency standard for new light duty
             vehicles will be in force.
          By project end, it is expected that the number of vehicles covered by freight transport
             operators action plans to improve fuel performance will be at least 30,000 vehicles, and
          That at least 50 companies that use freight transport services will have an action plan.

15.    Urban Sector Objectives: The objective of the DPL in the urban sector was to assist the
Government in meeting its short- and medium-term climate change goals through the promotion
of energy-efficient housing. Key performance indicators included:
      Policy Area 4 – Energy Efficient Housing Development
          200,000 newly constructed residential buildings incorporate CONAVI’s sustainable
             housing criteria and receive the subsidy;

                                                        5
            100,000 newly constructed residential buildings are registered to receive carbon credits
             under the CDM programmatic methodology for sustainable housing; and
            CONAVI’s housing subsidies are mainstreamed with the “green mortgage? and that at
             least 140,000 subsidies are tied to the green mortgage.

16.     Forestry and Land Use Objectives: In the forestry and land use sector, the objective of the
DPL was to recognize and support Government reforms to the regulatory framework for
sustainable forest management, to be able to meet the PECC target of incorporating 2.95 million
hectares of forests under sustainable management. Within the context of such regulatory reforms,
the operation also built on Mexico’s efforts to formulate its national REDD+ strategy, a key pillar
of which is sustainable forest management. Key performance indicators included:
      Policy Area 5 – Sustainable Forest Management
          It is expected that within 12-18 months from loan effectiveness, the administrative
             procedures governing forest management will have been simplified as a result of the
             publication of the aforementioned agreement, with 2.95 M ha of forest having been
             incorporated under simplified administrative procedures.
          By 2012, the Government aspires to have developed the instruments, mechanisms,
             schemes, and institutional arrangements that will allow for the publication by
             SEMARNAT of a final REDD+ strategy draft for public consultation.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

There were no revisions or restructuring and the program objectives remained unchanged.

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

17.     This Low-Carbon DPL addressed four policy areas—Energy, Transport, Urban, and
Forestry. The DPL was structured to closely support PECC goals and objectives in these policy
areas. Below is a listing of relevant PECC objectives, select PECC goals relating to these
objectives, and issues/obstacles that programs aimed at achieving these goals and objectives must

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

19.    The Government of Mexico’s strong commitment to its globally recognized climate
change strategy and the Banks’s extensive program of support for that strategy were major factors
having a positive impact on implementation of this DPL. Although this operation was
implemented in the wake of an economic crisis, the Government has remained committed to the
operation and progress was not delayed or impacted by budget shortfalls.

20.     Strong Government Commitment. Since 2005 when the Inter-secretarial Commission on
Climate Change (CICC) was created, the Government of Mexico has consistently demonstrated a
strong commitment to its climate change agenda. Reaching many of the PECC goals and
objectives requires strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework at the sector level. The
current DPL supported several critical legal and regulatory changes identified by the PECC.

21.      The Low-Carbon DPL’s Linkages to GoM and Bank Priorities. The policy areas that
are supported by the Bank through this multi-sector DPL mirror the themes of the FY08-FY13
Country Partnership Strategy for Mexico, which in turn mirror the GoM’s 2007- 2012 National
Development Plan. The NDP and CPS contain the same four pillars: (i) reduction of poverty and
inequality, (ii) increasing competitiveness, (iii) strengthening institutions, and (iv) environmental
sustainability. The policy areas contribute to varying degrees to all of these pillars, but especially
to the last three.

22.      Soundness of the Background Analysis.

23.    The Low-Carbon DPL was prepared based on a strong analytical foundation provided by
the Mexico Low-Carbon Study (MEDEC), which was carried out by the Bank in coordination and
consultation with a number of environmental and sectoral institutions in Mexico and external
partners. MEDEC, in turn, contributed to the analytical underpinning of the Government’s Special
Program for Climate Change (PECC). This DPL is thus an integral part of the GoM’s extensive
climate change abatement strategy.

24.     Three sets of implementation risks were identified at appraisal: Economic and Fiscal;
Political and Institutional; and Social and Environmental. These risks and accompanying
mitigation measures are summarized in the table below.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25.      The design of the monitoring and evaluation framework was satisfactory. A separate
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was not created. Instead, each participating governmental
institution was responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the policy areas they addressed.
Outcome indicators were directly aligned with the five policy areas addressed in the DPL, and
the responsible Governmental units shared progress on the monitoring indicators with Bank staff.
Because of the focus on policy, regulatory and institutional development, the majority of the
monitoring steps involved one-step evaluation of program achievements completed by the time
of ICR. The Ministry of Environment (SEMARNAT) was responsible for the coordination
among the agencies under the DPL.

2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

26.     At this point, there are no planned follow-up DPLs for the sector. The World Bank remains
actively engaged in climate mitigation and low-carbon development in Mexico, including through
ongoing and proposed new knowledge, financial, and convening services, such as energy subsidies
studies, the implementation of a pilot project for the use of the Tool for Rapid Assessment of City
Energy (TRACE), and the Sustainable Energy Technology Development project, funded through a
GEF Grant.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

27.     The Low-Carbon DPL’s objectives were and are relevant and closely aligned with the
Government’s NDP and the Bank’s CPS. In addition to being an important component of the
Bank’s climate change initiative in Mexico, the Low-Carbon DPL also contributed to the
government’s broader Ten Point Program to confront the crisis. Contributions include: (1)
buffering the impact of the crisis by making energy efficiency housing loans to low-income
households and through the forest management program, which provides low-income land holders
access to forest management strategies; (2) competitiveness was strengthened through various
measures to improve energy efficiency within the industrial and transport sectors, and (3) all the
policy areas addressed in the operation included institutional strengthening as an important
objective and explicit component of regulatory reform.

3.2    Achievement of Program Development Objectives

28.     By successfully addressing high-priority policy and regulatory reforms critical to reaching
the mitigation targets contained in the PECC, the Low-Carbon DPL has contributed to the GoM’s
climate change strategy. Below are summaries of the achievement of program development
objectives for each Policy Area.

Policy Area 1: Cogeneration and Small-Scale Renewable Energy Development

29.      Rules encouraging large- and small-scale cogeneration plants to produce electricity and
sell surplus electricity to the grid have contributed to reaching PECC’s climate change goals. This
prior action has led to an increase in cogeneration, as represented by an increase in new

                                               12
cogeneration permits issued by the CRE. The trend is especially encouraging given the impact on
the economy from the crisis that peaked in the first part of 2009.

30.     Renewable energy development has been stimulated by a new net-metering regulation
(prior action) that allows RE-based producers to either receive credits, which can be used to
offset periods when they are net electricity consumers, or be paid for surplus electricity that is
supplied to the grid; a wheeling tariff covering transmission and distribution charges; and a model
interconnection contract for cogeneration and RE-based electricity generation. Data from the Solar
Energy Association in Mexico confirm that there has been an increase in the installation of solar
PV equipment, both for large-scale arrays, and for smaller rooftop systems.We are witnessing the
early stages of a boom in solar PV installations in Mexico, made possible in large part by the net-
metering regulatory change.

31.    The third area that was targeted in Policy Area 1, was for the increase in large-scale
cogeneration plants by PEMEX (Gas and Petrochemicals), where there exists substantial untapped
potential for new power generation capacity. A key to realizing investments in cogeneration within
Pemex has been the ability to sell surplus electricity to CFE under the Electric Energy Public
Service Law (Ley de Servicio Público de Energía Eléctrica), Article 36.

Policy Area 2: Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction in Oil and Gas Production

32.      This policy area reflects the potential for large-scale emissions reductions from Mexico’s
oil and gas industry. At the beginning of the operation, Pemex was venting and flaring almost as
much natural gas as was imported, which amounted to about 25 percent of Mexico’s natural gas
use in 2008. As prior actions for this policy area, CNH published a Resolution to Reduce Pemex
Gas Flaring and Venting and Pemex responded by submitting publicly to CNH non-binding
recovery goals in line with the goals outlined by CNH. Achieving these targeted reductions is
critical to meeting PECC goals. Fortunately, Pemex is ahead of schedule in its gas flaring and
venting reductions, both at Cantarell and other fields. (Cantarell is Mexico’s largest oil field.)

    2012          30.4 (47)         96.5 (145)


Policy Area 3: Fuel Efficiency in Vehicles and Transport Operations

33.     Although this regulatory change is currently in limbo, with the court challenge by two
vehicle manufacturers (a similar process occurred in the U.S. with the CAFE Standards
legislation), it is likely that the new energy efficiency and CO2 emission control standard for new

                                               13
light duty vehicles will be successfully implemented. Mexican authorities have been allowed to
continue the process of developing the standard while the outcome of the litigation is being
determined. As a result, a revised standard taking into account the results of the public
consultation was submitted to SEMARNAT’s Standardization Committee on February 8, 2013.
The Committee decided to submit the revised standard to a new 60 day public consultation period.
If the court rejects the claims of vendors, the standard could enter into force in the first half of
2013. If the claims are accepted, the standardization process needs to start again.

34.     The Voluntary Clean Transport program (VCT) to encourage energy efficiency among
freight transport operators has been the slowest of the 11 targeted action areas for this DPL. Only
18,488 vehicles are currently covered by the VCT, which is about 62 percent of the goal.
However, only a 6 percent of the goal has been achieved in the number of freight service users
with adopted action plans. Not having a similar program to draw upon, a lesson learned from
implementation of the DPL is that the original targets were too ambitious, especially in terms of
timing (only 24 months). However, staff from the Voluntary Clean Transport program indicate
that there is increasing knowledge of the program and that three to five new members have been
joining each month. Assuming that participants continue to experience fuel and monetary gains
from the program, competitive forces are likely to encourage other firms to participate, increasing
the chances that the target can be met.

Policy Area 4: Energy Efficient Housing Development

35.    Given that it is estimated that about 7 million new homes will be constructed during the
decade following approval of this DPL, achieving the energy efficiency targets set out for this
sector will play an important role in reaching PECC goals. Given the large amount of housing
being constructed, and the fact that operating expenditures for housing lies with the owners,
CONAVI has for many years focused on improving the efficiency of housing construction.

36.     This program specifically targeted the housing subsidies from CONAVI that go to
qualifying houses with energy efficient designs and eco-technologies, such as insulation, efficient
lighting, and efficient appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners. The program greatly
exceeded the target, with a total of 375,956 housing subsides granted in less than two years.

37.    Given Mexico’s interest in the international carbon market, a subsidiary indicator was for
the housing units within the Green Mortgage program to be eligible for carbon credits. Carbon
market experts have verified that all of the green mortgages issued in Mexico qualify for the
CDM. In reality, the Mexico’s green mortgage program has not been registered with the CDM, so
no carbon revenues have flowed to Mexico. Mexico is continuing to work on this area and is
preparing a NAMA (National Appropriate Mitigation Actions) that would qualify green housing
in Mexico for carbon credits.

38.     The final target in the urban housing policy area was for housing that qualifies for the
CONAVI energy efficiency subsidies to be supported by Mexico’s green mortgage (Hipoteca
Verde) program. This target, reflecting the broader intention of Mexico to link major mortgage
programs to energy efficiency and climate mitigation, was greatly surpassed. Between 2011 to
March 2012 CONAVI granted 351,444 up-front subsidies to support green mortgages, exceeding
the target by 151 percent.

                                               14
39.     In a related event, a model construction code was introduced by CONAVI in in 2012. The
code is designed so that it can be adapted for use in any Mexican State, and to date four states are
in the process of adapting their codes to this model.

Policy Area 5: Sustainable Forest Management

40.      The objective of the forestry policy area was to accelerate sustainable forestry management
by simplifying the permitting process. Two indicators were proposed to measure the increase in
sustainable forest management. The primary one, given that the prior action was meant to simplify
the permitting process, was the number of permits granted. A secondary indicator was the amount
of land coming under sustainable management. In terms of the permits, the target was greatly
exceeded during the year and half from project approval to project closing. However, in terms of
the total area, only 2.18 million hectares were covered under the permits compared to the target of
2.95 million hectares. Considering that both of these targets were set to be achieved in only 18
months is an indication that they were “stretch? targets and that the program has delivered good
results in a short period. The variability in the size of the production areas impacted by the permits
is very high, indicating the program is reaching a wide diversity of landholders, which is a positive
sign for the continued potential of the program and likely more important for the long-term
success of the program than hectares alone. Overall, the regulatory reform identified as a prior
action contributed to improving the efficiency of processing permits for forest management
activities, which was one of the main barriers preventing the incorporation of land under
sustainable forest management.


41.    The second target area for sustainable forest management was the advancement of
Mexico’s REDD (reducing emissions from forest degradation and deforestation) program. The
GoM reaffirmed its commitment to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in
Mexico’s REDD+ Vision, launched during the session of the 16th Conference of the Parties to the
UNFCCC in December 2010 in Cancún (COP 16). The REDD+ Vision is a milestone of the
government-social sector cooperation and represents the first step towards the National REDD+
Strategy (ENAREDD+). The GoM issued the first vision of the ENAREDD+ in January 2012 for
comments. The draft version of ENAREDD will be widely disseminated and shared with relevant
stakeholders, and it is expected to be published in 2014. It is expected that the World Bank,
through the Readiness funds of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), will continue
support of ENAREDD+.

42.     Additionally, the Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies approved reforms to the
General Law of Sustainable Forest Development allowing forest-land owners who manage their
land to benefit from the observance of international legislation and social and environmental
safeguards. Also, the Climate Change General Law was approved on April 17, 2012 explicitly
calling on CONAFOR to design strategies and actions for a transition towards a zero percent
carbon loss rate, with the purpose of including the strategies in planning and defining forestry
policy.

3.3      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

43.     Rating: Satisfactory. Based on the operation’s achievement of its objectives as reflected in
the PDO and key associated outcome targets with only minor shortcomings, the Overall Outcome
Rating is judged to be Satisfactory. The operation supported the GoM’s efforts to improve the
regulatory structure so as to promote the implementation of effective climate change strategies. By
extending Mexico’s climate change strategies to new sectors, the operation strongly supported t he
objectives contained in the ENACC and the PECC. During the implementation of the loan, the
GoM passed a new Climate Change General Law, which will have wide-ranging implications for
government policies in the sectors of the economy targeted by the DPL for years to come and
ensure that this program will not be undone by subsequent administrations. The end result is a
broadening and deepening of Mexico’s already extensive climate change strategy, thereby
enhancing Mexico’s status as a global leader on climate change, and aligning actions on climate
change with the country’s national sustainable development program.
3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

44.      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The Low-Carbon DPL did
not have a specific focus on reducing poverty, though some aspects of the operation are likely to
have beneficial impacts on lower-income groups; for instance the subsidies for the purchase of
energy-efficient housing under the National Housing Commission (CONAVI) are limited to
lower-income groups. The reforms in sustainable forest management will allow low-income
communities in rural areas, many of them indigenous peoples, to make use of forested lands for
their livelihood in exchange for sustainable stewardship. No specific analysis of gender aspects or
broader social development of the operation was planned nor has been done as part of the ICR.

45.     Institutional Change/Strengthening. The expected outcomes of the Low-Carbon DPL
were principally aimed at institutional strengthening and have been discussed above. Examples
include revised policies encouraging cogeneration and renewable energy adoption, reduction of
gas flaring and venting at Pemex facilities, new vehicle emission standards, broadening of energy
efficiency housing programs, and improved forest management.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

47.      Rating: Moderate. The rating is based on:

     Many of the operational objectives have been incorporated into policies and regulations in the
      major policy areas and are having beneficial effects.
     The Low-Carbon DPL policy areas make critical contributions to PECC outcomes
     Mexico’s reputation as a leader in climate change strategies necessitates maintaining the
      programs that are responsible for that reputation, including the programs supported by this
      DPL

                                                 16
48.     The change in administration has not had deleterious effects on Mexico’s climate change
policy, which is due both to a continued commitment by Governments at all levels to the program
and to the enactment of the new Climate Change General Law in 2012.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

49.      Rating: Satisfactory. This Low-Carbon DPL is part of an extensive program of assistance
supporting the Government of Mexico’s goal to develop a world class climate change program. A
critical part of the GoM program, as embodied in the PECC, is low-carbon development. The DPL
was developed to assist in meeting PECC goals while incorporating information from the MEDEC
study, which identified a number of high-priority interventions. Basing the policy areas on the
MEDEC study helped ensure that the program was grounded in specific high-priority areas where
regulatory policy was also moving in the direction to be able to implement respective low-carbon
policies.
5.1.2. Quality of Supervision

50.     Rating: Satisfactory. Bank personnel conducted periodic missions throughout the
implementation period focusing on making progress toward meeting the operation’s monitoring
indicators, and monitoring that, following the disbursement of loan proceeds, the agreed funds
flow arrangements were complied with, and the required documentation confirming such
arrangements was received by the Bank from the government. Given the number of related
operations that the Bank has in Mexico in the sectors of concern, there were numerous
opportunities to check on the status of the broader policy areas covered by the DPL. Of particular
importance given the short implementation period of the loan was the final supervision mission
carried out shortly before the loan closed in June 2012. This supervision mission recommended
that the period of analysis for the target indicators be extended from 18 months to 24, because of
the short time to meet the targets and of the difficulty of evaluating the targets in mid-year (June),
whereas data for most of the indicators was assessed at year end. This extension was the main
reason for the four-month delay in the preparation of the ICR for the project.

5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

51.    Rating: Satisfactory. As stated above, the Bank’s supervision and ensuring quality at entry
were satisfactory, supporting a rating of Satisfactory for Overall Bank Performance.

5.2    Borrower Performance

5.2.1 Government Performance

52.    N/A (only an overall rating is necessary for development policy lending operations)

5.2.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

53.    N/A (only an overall rating is necessary for development policy lending operations)

5.2.3. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

54.     Rating: Satisfactory. The Government of Mexico’s commitment to building a globally
recognized climate change strategy, including the role played by this DPL, has been strong. The
Ministry of the Environment, SEMARNAT, was responsible for coordinating the activity under
this Low-Carbon DPL. Other agencies in addition to SEMARNAT involved in implementing the
operation included: CRE, CNH, CONUEE, SENER, and CONAVI. While all the agencies are to
be commended, SEMARNAT deserves special recognition. One shortcoming of the operation was
that project effectiveness was delayed for nearly one year, though this did not affect the positive
achievements in all policy areas. Based on the criteria for Government Performance, the overall
rating is satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

55.    Borrower Commitment. It is well recognized that Strong Country Ownership is critical to
successful implementation and this was the case with this operation. The Government of Mexico
was fully committed to developing its climate change strategy of which this DPL is an important
part.

56.    Solid Analytic Basis. The DPL drew on the extensive analytical work done on low-carbon
development in Mexico, which was also used to prepare Mexico’s Clean Technology Fund
Investment Plan, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Assistance Programs, and the
Sustainable Urban Transport Program.

57.     Strong Relationship between the Bank and Borrower. The Low-Carbon DPL benefitted
from the World Bank’s ongoing dialogue and good relationship with Mexico on a range of climate
change issues. This included previous cross-sectoral DPLs, and other operations in Mexico on
both climate mitigation and adaptation.

58.     Coordination by SEMARNAT. The DPL benefitted by placing coordination of the
substantive aspects of the program with SEMARNAT which has an overall understanding of
Mexico’s broad climate change program. Thus, rather than placing the coordination of the multi-
sectoral DPL operation under on the several sectoral agencies involved in the project,
SEMARNAT played an important coordinating role taking responsibility not only for those
environment and resources aspects within in domain (such as forestry), but assuming
responsibility for the broader global environmental goals of the DPL

59.    Short Implementation Timetable. As is the case with all single-tranche DPL operations,
the time period for implementation is very short. This project found that it was difficult to define
meaningful targets that could be achieved in only 18 months. As a partial solution, and given the
lack of mid-year data for many of the indicators, the time period for measuring the targets was
extended to 24 months.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1     Borrower/Implementing agencies

60.     The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) and BANSEFI provided comments on the Draft
ICR that have been incorporated into the revised ICR. Among the key comments was the request to
eliminate the phrase “(as % of total Bank financing),? in the data sheet so as to show that the financial
resources from the loan were not provided to the sectors concerned. This revised presentation is consistent
with the way the issue has been addressed in the ICRs for other DPLs in Mexico.
