                         The Policy Development Objective (PDO) of the Development Policy
                         Loan is to support sector-specific, high-priority policy and regulatory
                         reforms that have been identified as critical to achieve Mexico?s climate
                         change mitigation targets under the PECC for:

                             Increasing renewable energy supply, promoting energy efficiency
                         through cogeneration, reduce gas flaring and venting, and piloting the
                         reform of the rural agricultural electricity subsidy;
                             Improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport
                         operations in Mexico;
                             Strengthening the market for energy-efficient housing; and
                          Mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and
                         forestry activities.

                         2.    In addition, the proposed operation will contribute to the efforts
                         of the Mexico government to: (i) facilitate Mexico?s involvement in the
                         international carbon market, and (ii) implement Nationally Appropriate
