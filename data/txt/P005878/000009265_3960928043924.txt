!i eoct Ob.ectives:         The proposed project would assist PCEP in: (i)
meting the incremental demand for electricity in
the Aden region by rehabilitation of the Aden
System; (li) reducing line losses in the Aden
system and in the Wadi Hadranawt Branch; (iii)
improving PCEP's financial position; and (iv)
improving the technical and uanagerial skills of
PCEP's staff.
Ibr   ;e     t Descrinion:  The project would consist of: (a) the installation
of line loss reduction and rehabilitatlon
equipment at the Aden System; (b) tho installation
of equipment for the first phaso of the Aden
System Network Control Center; (c) the
installation of equipment for line loss reduction
at the Wadi Hadramawt Branch; (d) consultancy
services to assist PCEP during preconstruction
and construction phases of (a), (b) and (c) above;
and (e) consultancy services (including training
equipment and training overseas of PCEP's
staff/trainers) for trAaing PCEP'a staff in
efficient operation and maintenance of PCEP's
assets.
Benefits and &isks:         Project benefits would include: (i) a reduction of
line losses resulting in improved productivity and
less fuel consumption at the power stations;
(ii) the increased reliability of electrical

supply; (iii) an imprtv.mt.t in PCR's financial
performance due to reduction of expenses and
increased sales revenues; and (iv) improvement in
operational And managerial skills of PCIP's staff.
There are no sajor risks associated with the
project. Delays in project implementation would
have an adverse impact on the rate of return on
investment. The risk of project cost overruns is
minimized since the project cost estimates
(including price contingencies) are spread over
seven years, even though a similar project could
be completed in five years. Further, to reduce
the risk of project implementation delays, the
project includes engineering consultancy services
to assist PCEP in procureent, installation and
comissioning activities under the project.
Furthermore, a very conservative load forecast for
electricity sales has been assumed for the
financial forecast. Therefore, any impact on the
rate of return, steming from the above-mentioned
risks, is minimal.

I, SECTOR BACKCROUND
A.  ng   Sco
1.01          acroecM=ic Context   The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen
(PDRY) is a country of limited resources and weak institutions. The economy
depends heavily on external resources, especially foreign aid and workers'
remittances, for investment and consumption. Since its creation as a
sovereign state in 1967, PDRY's economy has been based on centralized planning
and collective ownership of resources. During 1981-85, real GDP of PDRY grew
at 4.3 percent a year. This growth was based primarily on inflows of workers'
remittances, expanded production capacities in agriculture, fisheries and
manufacturing sectors. However, since mid-1985, economic growth suffered
serious setbacks because of consecutive droughts, factional disturbances in
1986 and floods in March/April 1989. Furthermore, the recent decline in
workers' remittances and foreign aid has curtailed economic activity and
resulted in reduced investmeints; as a result, between 1985 and 1989, there was
virtually no growth in real GDP. A return to sustainable economic growth
requires reforms in policies aimed at improving the climate for savings and
investment, strengthening of institutions and increasing their output, export
diversification and improving efficiency of the productive sectors.
1.02        Energv Resources.  PDRY has no known comercial energy resources,
although hydrocarbon deposits are currently being eiLplored.  In 1987,
Technoexport (USSR) was reported to have found oil in comercially exploitable
quantities in the Shabwa Governorate. An agreement was signed with the USSR
to study the feasibility of developing these fields and of building a 230-km
pipeline for transporting oil from the Shabwa region to Bir Ali, where an
export terminal would be built. The pipeline construction comenced in
October 1988, and the commencement of operations at the terminal is scheduled
for 1990 with an initial throughput planned at 1.2 million m ton per annum.
Meanwhile, crude oil transported by trucks to the Aden rofinery totalled
25,000 n tons in 1988 and increased to 270,000 m tons in 1989. The country
uay also have gas reserves of up to 113 billion m.  Gas separation and
desulphurisation units may be required for gas production, and the economics
of gas utilizatior would have to be evaluated. Non-commercial energy
resources such as firewood, and animal and agricultural wastes, are limited
and are used in rural areas. The Government is investigating solar energy. k
pilot project in the Lahej area uses photovoltaic array to supply power to a
clinic and telecommunication station. Another pilot project in the Lahej area
uses photovoltaic array for pumping water.

1.03        &wf1I and-Bund.  At prosent 901 of PDRY'. energy neods are m*t
by imported petroleum and the rest is not by fuelvood and bio-mss, for which'
data is not readily availablo. The supply and consumption of energy in PDlY
for the period 1980-2000 in given in Amnwx2.ll (page 1 of 6) and sumer!zod in
Fig. 1.1 of para. 1.05. At present, PDRY imports most of its petroloue
requirements in the form of crude oil, which is refined in the Aden Refinery
Company (ARC). In 1988 about 601 of tho total gross consumption of petroleum
in PDRY wss due to diesel and fuel oil; about 35Z on account of kerorene and
gasoline, and the balance consumption was due to Liquified Petroleum Cases
(LPG) and other products. During 1980-1989, gross energy consumption grow at
a rate of 0.831 per year and the elasticity of onergy demand to CDP was 0.81,
essentially due to: (a) sluggish economic growth especially during 1985-1988,
which forced the Government to impose strict import restrictions; (b) rising
domestic prices; and (c) growing importance of the service sector which is not
as energy intensive. After reaching a peak of about 638,000 at in 1985,
consumption declined to about 510,000 at in 1987. It is estimated that the
1985 level of petroleum consumption will not be reached until 1999,
particularly since the Government is determined not to increase the level of
petroleum imports. This situation, however, could charge when enough domestic
oil is produced to meet the internal demand for petroleum and its products
after 1993. No accurate sectoral data on energy consumption is available. A
rough assessment of energy consumption by end use for the period 1985-1989
indicates that the consumption pattern has remained essentially unchanged.
Table 1.1 below gives the breakdown of energy consumption by sectors.

Source: Annex 1.1 (page 1 of 6)
Table 1.1 shows that the transport sector, which uses mostly diesel and
gasoline, is the largest energy consumer (451 in 1988) followed by t4ke
domestic sector (271). The balance energy is consumed by industry (U11),
co=_erce (111) and agriculture (6X). It is assessed that 701 of the non-
co mercial energy (fuelwood and biomass) is consumed by the rural consumers in
the domestic sector. Furthermore, it is estimated that about 331 of the
consumers in the domestic sectWr use kerosene for lighting; about 491 use
electricity from ~he public electricity network and the balance 181 use other
means (including private electricity generation) for lighting.

1.06        Energy Ptices - Present Status. Unttl now, the Government's main
strategy in the energy sector has been to control the consumption of petroleum
and its products \through pricing mechanisms. Thus, it raised the prices of
petroleum producto in ;l973, 1980 and 1981 in response to increases\in the



4-
international prices of petroleum produts. Hovever, it did not lower the
prices of petroleum products in early 1986 when the prices of petroleum fell
on the international market. Therefore, today the internal prices of
petroleum products are above internatlonal levels. Table 1. 2 given the ratios

c.i.f. prices converted to YD at official exchange rates,
To curb private consumption, gasoline prices are kept very high -- more than
four times international prices. From 1986 through 1989, the fuel oil and
diesel oil prices were about 1.5 and 2 times the intezr itional prices. High
fuel oil and diesel oil prices also result in high ele'; !icity tariffs.
Therefore, from 1986 onwards, Public Corporation for E7V-:.tric Power (PCEP) is
unable to break-even21 although the average electricity cariff is about 25X
above the average tariff based on Long-Run Marginal Costs (RMC). The
Government took corrective measures and, effective May 1, 1990, reduced the
fuel oil prices charged to PCEP to international level of prices (para. 4.16).
However, at the same time, the Government reduced the average tariff for
domestic consumers by 291 (para. 4.13). The impact of these actions on the
financial performance of PCEP are discussed in para. 4.16.   Annex 1.1 (page 2
of 6) gives the changes in electricity tariffs for various cc-*user categoties
from 1983 through May 1990 and pages 3 through 6 of the Annex r,ve the basis
of LRMC tariff calculations. Section IV (paras. 4.10 through 4.16) discusses
the effects of these tariff chages, and of the prices charged to PCEP for
fuel oil, on PCEP's future financial performance.

*earindim. Although the toqm g  of petroloue   imports in 1989 was only 23X
lover than that in 1983, the value of petroleum imports (US$69.5 million) in
1989 was about 42 percent of that recorded in 1983 mainly due to decline in
internat'lonal oil prices. Tho Governwnkt dos not pla" to increase the level
of petroleum imports in the near future.
1.08        RnergX InvLtmelir . The Goverunent's objoctives basically r*mained
unchanged in the Second (1981-1985)'and Third (1986-1990) Yive Year Plans.
However,/ there were substantial shifts in the socto-al allocation of
iu stmont from transport and social sector towards energy and indusarial
sectors. Invostments in th petroloum subsector were Increased to take
advantage of the discovery of oil in the Shabwa region in 1987 and to redLee
at the earliest the burden of petroleum imports (especially considering PDIY's
limited foreign exchange earnings). Therefore, priority was given for capital
intens,ive petroleum exploration and extraction projects designed to bring
about substitution of i4oorted cr,ide oil by tbe domestic crude oil. As a
result, the share of petroleum subsector investtent as a percentage of the
total public investment increased from 44 percent (YD 66 million) in 1988 to
51 percent (YD 74.6 million) in 1989. Future development expenditure is also
likely to be dominated by oil exploration and development, and Aden port
development projects.  Table 1.3 below shows the share of petroleum and
electricity subsectoiT in the total irne'stments during the Second and Third
Five Year Plans, and in the annual\plans for thb years 1986 through 1989.

1.09       tEnergy Setor OrIanizgali-M. Important policies and decisions in
PDRY are made by the Council\of Ministers and the Politburo. The Ministry of
Planning is responsible for the overall planning mnd programming in all
sectors. Within that franvork, the energy sector is administered by the MEN.
B. Petroleum  "sector
1.10        Subs Lctor Organization.  In the petroleum subsector, the Petroleum
Expl-ation Deparlt"ent undertakes all exploration activities independently or
in partnership vits foreign companies. other agencies in the subsector are:
' the Aden Re4inery Company (ARC), responsible for importing and refining crude
oil as Well as for importing petroleum products; the Yes .d National Oil
Company (YNOC), responsible for the internal distribution and marketing of
petroleym; the Yemeni Kuwait Terminal Company, a joint venture between YNOC
and Kuwait, that supplies bunker fuel; and the GeoloFical Survey and Minerals
Exploration Department. The governments'of PDRY arid the Yemen Arab Republic
recently sit up a joint venture company - Yemen Company for Investment in Oil
and 4ineral Resources.  The company will explore and develop the hydrocarbon
epotential of a 2,200 square kilometer neutral zone which straddles the'border
between the two countries.
1.11        To date, the'subsector has depended on imports of petroleui and
petroleum products to meet the energy demand in PDRY. 'Vith the dis'overy of
oil and gas in the Shabwa region, the Government wouid have to evaluate and
l'decide: (a) whether to export crude oil and import petroleum products or
itvest in additional refinery capacity; (b) how to utilize and price gas; and
(c) how to price and market refinevy\products, if the decision is made to
invest in additional refinery capacity.  The proposed Project is limited to'
the power subsector; these issues would have to be addressed'separately under
the proposed IDA energy sector review.
C.' Power Subsector
1-12        G*rwral Characteristics.  PCEP is responsible for the power
subsector in the country.  PCEP's organization is discussed in detail in
Section II. The power subsector is characterized by isolated islands of power
generation and associated transmission and diltribution networks designed to
meet the local demand for electricity. About Sb%'of the demand is for
domestic consumption; 32X iv for commercial loads; and the balance-of 181 is
for industrial, agro-industrial and other uses. This demand pattern is
typical of a country which has yet to fully develop its industrial and
agricultural capabilities.
1.13        Suptly and Demand.  PCEP dominates the power geieratioii in PDRY.
In 1989, it owne'd about 801 of the installed generatton capacity \n PDRY and
generated about 841 of the country's need for electrical power; the balance
waskproduced by ARC (111) and other local agencies (51).  Electricity sales
grew annually at about  81 p.a. from 1980 to 1988, while the real GDP during
the same perio4 grew at less than 2X a year.  Table 1.4 shows that in a
centrally administered economy like VDRY, growth rates in electricity sales do



\7.
not seem to bear any logical relationship to the GDP growth rates.' In fact,
in 1989, there was zero gpowth rate for GDP and elOctricity sales.

Annex 1.2 gives the historical data of PCEP's generation and sales from 1980
through 1988 and Annex 1.3 gives PCEP's generation and sales for 1989, and
forecast for 1990 through 1996.  Electricity sales grew annually at about 121
from 1980 to 1985 while the real GDP annual growth rate during the same period
was about 4.31. However in 1986, due to political unrest, electricity sales
remained stagnant at 1985 levels while the GDP growth rate for 1986 was
negative.  Considering PDRY's present economic situation and the reduction in
workers' remittances (para. 1.01), total electricity sales for the period
1989-1996 are expected to grow annually at only about 6X compared to a 121
growth rate from 1980 to 1985.  Therefore, IDA and PCEP agreed on the
following annual growth rates for the important consumer categories: (i) sales
to domestic consumers which grew at about 151 from 1980 to 1985, would reduce
to about 71 from 1989 to 1996; (ii) sales to commercial/combined consumers is
estimated to reduce from 231 to about 41 during the same periods; and (iii)
sales to agricultural/industrial consumers which was 61 from 1980 to 1985,
would reduce to about 41 from 1989 to 1996.
1.14        Generation.  PCEP's installed capacity in 1989 was about 217 MW:
139 NW in diesel, 75 MW in thermal, and 3 KW in combustion turbine
installations. The installed capacity by the end of 1996 is estimated to be
275 MW: 147 NW in diesel, 125 MW in thermal, and 3 MW in comb4stion turbine
installations. The thermal capacity of 125 NW is in the Hiswa Power and
Desalination Plant (HPDP) in the Aden System. In 1989 the Aden System
accounted for 771 of PCEP's installed capacity, followed by the Hukalla Branch
(91); the Wadi Hadramawt Branch (71); the Abyan Branchl  (41); and the Shehr
Branch (31). With the commissioning of two units, each of 25 MW capacity at
Hiswa, the Aden System (including Abyan Branch) had an excess itstalled
capacity in 1989 (175 NW to meet a demandV1of 86 NW).  Even in 1996, when the
Aden System would have an installed capacity of 217 NW to rkeet the estimated
1/ With the comnissioning,of the 132-Wy Hisaw-Abyan transmission tine, electricity needs of the JAbysn
are are being met from the Aden System (para. 2.03)

system demand of 125 NW, there would be an excess capacity. ormally 164 mY
would be adequate to mete the demand of 125 KW. The excess installed
generation capacity In the Adn System fro 1987 to 1996 is the direct result
of the Governoent choosing the costlior desalination over the conventional
methods of water production to meet the long-term future demand for potable
water in the Aden region. This decision has rosulted in:
(a) higher installation costs - US$1, 900/kV of installed capacity
compared to US$900/kW for a conventional oil-fired thermal pow r
plant;
(b) higher auxiliary consumption in the Power Plant of HPDP - 15X
of units generated (without th. operation of the desalination
plant) or 13X with the desalination plant in operation, compared
to about 61 for the conventional oil-fired thermal power plant;
(c) higher spinning reserve to be maintained due to the higher
unit size of 25 KW installed at Hiswa for matching water
production when 8-10 MW would normally have been adequate for the
Aden System demand of 77 KW in 1982 (the situation would ioprove
somewhat in 1996 when the maximum doeand of tho Aden System would
increase to 125 NW);
(d)   higher fuel cost per kWh sent out [para. 1.19(f)]; and
(e)   higher operating costs due to increased depreciation as a
result of higher capital costs.
1.15        Transmission and Distribution.  PCEP's Aden System (including Adena
Branch), which accounts for 831 of PCEP's total assets and 79X of its sales,
is more than 25 years old. The equipment at the important substations needs
to be replaced to reliably and adequately meet future demand. In addition,
the Aden System needs power factor improvement equipment to reduce the system
line losses (currently about 181) which would substantially itcrease in 1996
without the power factor inprovenent compared to an acceptable level of about
121. Unlike the Aden System, which is predominantly urban, the Wadi Hadramawt
Branch caters to loads in a rural area. The loads are spread out along the
length of the Wadi Hadramawt Valley, requiring longer
transuission/distribution lines. Even though the Vadi Hadramawt Branch
network is newly installed, the future irrigation pumping loads to be
connected to the network need line loss reduction equipment. Losses of about
192 (without loss reduction equipment) estimated in 1996 need to be reduced to
about 141, a reasonable percentage for a rural system. The Government/PCEP
realizes that any investment in rehabilitation and loss reduction measures in
the Aden System and Wadi Hadraaawt Branch would improve PCEP's operational
efficiency and its financial position. 1pue to rehabilitation efforts already
initiated by PCEP, the line losses at the Mukalla Branch decreased from 301 in
1980 to 241 in 1989. Line losses, however, still remain too high. High lipe
losses are mainly due to the old 3.3-kV and 6.6-kV sub-transmission systems in
the Nukalla Branch; the system needs to be converted to 11 kV PCEP has
initiated measures for converting these systems to 11 kV so as to bring down



9
thi line losses in the  *ukalla Branch to about 13X by 1996. As mentioned in
para. 2.03, the electricity needs of the Abyan Branch are being m_t from the
Aden System after 1989 and, therefore, liie losses in the Abyan Branch are not
discussed here. PCEP's Shehr Branch has a comparatively now transmission and
distribution network (com_issioned in June 1987); except for distribution
extensions required for norml load growth, the network does not require any
lnvestment for rehabilitation. PCIP's highest transmission voltage in 1988
was 33-kV. This was adequate to seet the restricted netrorks in the Aden
System and the four branches (Abyan, Mukalla, Wadi Hadranmat and Shehr). The
situation changed in 1989 with the coamissioning (at a cost of about US$21
sillion) of the 132-kV Hiswa-Abyan (Ja-ar) transmission line to supply power
to the proposed Battees Cemnt Plant (11 KW) and other existing loads (5 NV)
in the Abyan area. However, the capacity of the 132-kV transmission line
would be underutilized since the construction of the cement factory has been
delayed and the cement factory load is not likely to be connected to PCEP's
Aden System before 1995/1996.
1.16        Investment and Planning.  Annex 1.4 gives PCEP's investment plan
for 1986-1990. The appraisal mission reviewed PCEP's future requirements to
meet the projected electricity demand for 1990-1996 (Annex 1.3). The revised
investment plan for 1989-1996 is given in Amex 1.5.  PCEP's investment for
1989-1996 is expected to be about YD 81 million (US$235.7 million) out of
which about YD 66 million (US$192 million) is in foreign exchange. Though
PCEP is involved in planning and in decisions about future investments in the
power subsector, major policy and investment decisions are taken by the
Council of Ministers and the Politburo (para. 1.09). As a result, PCEP
sometimes gets invelved in inefficient investments and operations, such as the
installation and operation of the HPDP. The effect of this decision on PCEP's
operations is discussed in detail in paras. 1.14 and 1.19(f). The 132-kV
Hiswa-Abyan (Jatar) transmission line is also problematic since the
commissioning of the Batte6s Cement Plant has been delayed (para. 1.15) and
PCEP's investment in the 132-kV transmission line would remain underutilized.
PCEP's investment plan (Annex 1.4) was reviewed and revised by the appraisal
mission to include PCEr's investment requiresents till 1996. The revised
investment plan (Annex 1.5),except for investments in HPDP, was found to be
reasonable and is the least cost program for meeting the incremental demand of
electricity for the period 1989 - 1996. The financial projections in Section
IV and economic analyses in Section V are based on the revised investment plan
(Annex 1.5). However, as explained in para. 1.19(f), the analyses exclude the
investments in the desalination plant of HPDP, even though these are shown in
Annex 1.5 for information only.
1.17        Electricity Tariffs. Average electricity tariffs for 1988-1996,
based on LRMC, are given in Annex 1.1 (page 5 of 6). The existing and
projected average electricity tariff would be about 25X to 431 higher than the
LUIC based tariffs during the period. This is mainly due to the higher prices
of fuel and diesel oil charged to PCEP up to May 1990 (para. 1.06) and higher
operation cost of power plant at Hiswa [paras. 1.14 and 1.19(f)b, In 1989,
fuel accounted for about 371 of PCEP's total operating expenses (including
depreciation on revalued assets) and was the major expense item which affects
PCEP's financial performance. Effective May 1, 1990, the Govrnment reduced



-10-
the pric, of fuel oil charged to PCEP( which accounts for 98X of PCEP's fuel
consumption) to the level of international price, however, at the ame time,
the Government reduced by about 29X the average tariff for domestic consumnrs
and increased, effective March 1, 1990, the average salary of PCEP's staff by
291(para. 4.16). The fLnancial implications of these actions are dealt wLth
at length in Section IV. Figure 1.2 below gives the projection of the average
electricity tariff based on LRMC for 1989-1996.

D. EnerSv Policy and Sectoral Issues
1.18        Energy poliy. The principal objectives of the Government are to:
(a) satisfy the basic needs of the population;
(b) strengthen the domestic production capacity to meet the



country's requirements, especially in agriculture, fisheries,
manufacturing, censtruction and minerals;
(c) optimize the use of limited resources (naterial, financial
and human) by improving the oporational efficiency of public
organizations in the power, transportation and telecomunications
sectors;
(d) raise educational standards with the mphasis on technical
and higher education; and
I(e) increase exports.
Since the recent oil discovery in the Shabwa region, the Government is also
concerned with the efficient utilization of crude oil and will take
appropriate decisions, as mentioned in para. 1.11.
1.19        Sector  Issukls. The following is a sumaary of the main issues in
the energy sector:
(a) Institutional Weaknesses. The serious shortage of skilled
manpower in PDRY is a major constraint to development. Although PCEP has made
considerable progress in strengthening its institution, it remains
inadequately equipped to handle its enhanced role (para. 2.06). A crash
training program funded under the previous IDA Credit 829-YDR, although
delayed, has been launched and would strive to strengthen PCEP's capacities,
especially in the areas of system planning, and in the operation and
maintenance of PCEP's assets. The proposed project would continue to assist
PCEP in its efforts to improve the calibre of its staff and to strengthen
PCEP's planning, accounting and management capabilities.
(b) Energy Import Dependence. Over 90% of PDRY's current energy
needs are met by imported oil and oil products. Although the value of
petrole   imports has declined since 1983, estimated petroleum imports
accounteo for about 12X of total imports and were about 80X of the export
earnings in 1989. Indigenous oil production may provide some relief in the
mid 1990's.
(c) Refinery Efficiency. ARC has been incurring operating losses
for several years due to its low rate of capacity utilization and outdated
technology. ARC has a monopoly in the import and re-export of crude oil and
oil products. The Government established the asphalt and LPG units in 1987
with a view to financially strengthening the refinery. However, foreign
markets for these units still need to be established to enable then to operate
profitably. Furthermore, the current worldwide surplus of refining capacity
and the presence of highly competitive refineries in the region make it
difficult for ARC to increase its throughput to a profitable level. Since
1985, the refinery operations have been below the break-even capacity (4.0
million =~tric tons); the throughput declined from 3.6 million metric tons in
1985 to 2.1 million metric tons in 1988. Therefore, the deficit incurred on
refii4ng operations and the refinery's investment needs were covered, in part,

(d) an -  rriln. As of January 1984, all petroleum products
bhne be"   priced above their international level  (table 1.2). The price
structure, howvwer, contains 'significant distortion, * epecially in gasoline'\
and diesel prices. With diesel price less than half that of gasoline, there
As mjor iDCentive to promot diesel-powered vahicles and pups.  It is'
necessary, therefore, to review the structure of petrolem  pricoe and make
approiate adjustents. According to mission estimates, power tariffs are
currently above LIkC by about 25 percent (para. 1.17) mainly due to the fuel
oil Amd diesel oil prieo s hich are above their international levels. MK and
the Pricing Board recomended and the Council\of Ministers agreed charging
PCIP the international price for fuel oil.. This is a step in the right
direction. The revised fuel oil prices charged to PCIP were reviewed by IDA's
negotiations team on Nay 15, 1990 and were found to be satisfactory.
(e) Excess. Generation Caoacity. Thore is an excess generation
capacity in PCEP's Aden\System (para. 1.14), and this excess capacity is
likely to continue till 1996. This is mainly due to the decision to install
five units of 25 NW capacity each\at HPDP. The implication of the excess
generation capacity and the size of the generating units at Hiswa are
discussed in paras. 1.14 And 1.19(f).
(f) Hiswa Power and Desalination Plant.  The Hiswa Plant is being
installed in two phases. Phase one consists of the installation and
commissioning of two 25-MW units for power generation and three desalination
blocks for water production; the second phase cbnsists of three 2.-MW units
and on" desalination block. PCEP already comuissioned three 25-MW units yby
June 1989'>and the rehzaining two units are scheduled to be comissioned from
1990 to 1991. The two desalination blocks were couissioned in 1989; the
third and fourth desalination blocks are scheduled to be coumissiored in 1990
and 1991, respectively. At full capacity, HPDP coa4d produce about 40,000 cu.
mater of desalinated water daily and, in addition, generate about 600 GWh of
electricity annually. The water production from the desalination plant is
very costly compared to water produced by conventional methods. If the Public
Water Corporation (PVC) does not purchase water from HPDP, PCEP's financial
performance will be adversely affected (para. 4.17).\ The investment decision
for production of desalinated water to meet future potable water needs of the
Aden region was taken by the Government in early 1980, when the conventional
sources of potable water were' limited. Additional conventional sources of
potable water were found later, when the construction of HPDP was well
advanced, making it difficult for the Government'to stop the work of HPDP at
Hiswa. HPDP is designed for efficient operation when producing water and
electricity. However, it is very ineffioient for the generation of '.

electricity alone1. NUt is aiAre of the issuss involved  nd coNsidered the
following measuros to resolve the issue of management of ?HPD: (1) it
discussed, without any succss, the possilility of cancellation of the fourth
desalination blick with USSR; (ii) it initiated a sarket survey on alternate
uses of desalinated water in the existing broveries, soft drink plants,
textile factory and in the production of bottled drinking water; (iii) it
submitted proposals to the Council of Ministers regarding operational
arr ngemnts for producing power and desalinated water; (iv) it recomonded to
the Council of Ministers to consider transferring the assets of power and
desalination facilities at Hiswa to PCEP at replacement cost which is
substantially lower than the cost of the present plant; (v) it recome_nded to
the Council of Ministers that both PCEP and PVC should be insulated from the
adverse impact of HPDP operations and that PCEP's  sals trice of desalinated
water be based on PCEP's production cost; and (vi) it recommended to the
Council of Ministers that any finatci-al loss resulting from the difference
between PCEP's sale price of desalinated water and the cost to PVC of the
desalinated water be borne by the Government. The Council of Ministers
considered HEK's recomendations regarding HPDP operations and it: (a) set up
a ainisterial codaittee to report, on the financial implicationa  of the HPDP
operations and alternative use of desalinated water including the possibility
of 'involving the private sector in production and marketing of bottled water;
and (b) directed PCEP to submit its report to the Council of Ministers for
revaluation of HPDP assets at replacement cost. Both the reports are
scheduled to be completed by September 1990. During negotiations, the
Government assured IDA that it would: (i) cause PCEP to operate the
desalination plant of HPDP at the ainimum level necessary to maintain the
equipment in good working condition pending completion of review by the
Government regarding alternative uses of desalinated water; (ii) cause PCEP 'to
revalue, by June 30, 1991, the assets of HPDP on the basis'of a methodology
satisfactory to IDA; and (iii) bear any losses incurred by PCEP and PWC from
sale and purchase of desalinated water produced at HFDF. IDA found these
asgurances to be satisfactory and would incorporate then in the Development
Credit Agreemet~t for the project. Since PCEP would oe insulated from the
adverse impact of HPDP operations, the financial and economic analysis do not
consider HPDP's desalination plant investment and operation costs.
(g) High Line Losses. PCEP's line losses have gradually
increased from about 13.5X in 1980 to 181 in 1989 (Asnexes 1.2 and 1.3).
These would be substantially higher by 1996, unless PCEP undertakes measures
for line loss reduction mentioned in para. 1.15.  In our forecast (Annex 1.3),
we have presumed PCEP would implement these measures so as to bring down the
line losses to about 121 by 1996. In addition to the rehabilitation of the
Aden System, the proposed project includes loss reduction measures for the
Aden System and the Wadi Hadramawt Branch. Given the limitations of IDA
credit for the country, and the Government's intention (para. 3.09) not to

have *y cofinancing, the project scope covers line loss reduction in the two
areas responsible for PCEP's bulk (about 90S) electricity sales. CRP,
however, should ensure that similar measures are initiated at its *ukalla
Branch and during negotiations the Governmnt agreed to put Into effect, by
December 31, 1990 *n action plan to reduce the line loss-s in the Mukalla
Branch to about 13X by 1996.
(h) Weak Financial Performance- Currently, PCEP is unable to
break-even (para. 1.06) for the reasons given in pares. 4.10 through 4.12.
The proposed project would help PGEP to improve its financial position through
rational pricing of fuel oil [para. 1.19 (d)] and by insulating PCEP from the
adverse impact of HPDP operations [pare. 1.19 (f)].
1.20        It is not possible for the proposed project to address all these
sectoral issues. It would, therefore, address those issues related
specifically to the power subsector [pare. 1.19 (a), (d), (e), (f), (g) and
(h)]. IDA would continue to assist PCEP and the Government to strengthen
PCEP's operational and financial position in these areas.
E. IDA's Inmolvement in the Energ Sector
1.21        IDA financed three projects in the energy sector:  one (Cr.
1050-YDR) for petroleum exploration in the petroleum subsector; and two (Cr.
829 and 1268-YDR) in the power subsector. Credit 1050-YDR (US$9 million
approved in 1980) supported the Government's efforts to explore hydrocarbon
reserves and strengthen the institutional capabilitfes of the Petroleum
Exploration Department in planning and implementation. The project was
successfully completed in 1984 and the project completion report was issued
(OED Report No. 6847 of June 18, 1987). HoweverS an important lesson was
learned from this project--the Government should be more careful in planning
and promoting external interest in exploration and should expedite the
processing and evaluation of bids. Since project completion, several
exploration contracts have been signed with foreign oil companies.
1.22        In the power subsector, Credit 829-YDR (US$5 million, approved in
1978) financed a diesel power plant and associated transmission and
distribution networks in the Wadi HadraGawt region. The project was completed
with the completion of the crash training program in March 1990. There was a
delay of about 5 years in completing the project due to a number of problems:
delays in credit effectiveness; insufficient coordination between PCEP and
the Ministry of Agriculture; slippage in the drilling program for deep
tubewells; fewer pumps connected to the electrical network than estimated; and
delays in providing fuel oil for the power station. An important lesson
learned, therefore, was that greater inter-ssectoral coordination is a must in
such situations for efficient project implementation. The second operation,
Credit 1268-YDR (US$7.5 million, approved in 1982) has helped finance the
electrification of 5 towns east of Mukalla and 13 nearby villages. This
project has suffered from delays due to cost overruns, difficulties in
reaching an agreement with the Government on amendments to financial
covenants, and consequent slow disbursements. In addition, during 1983-1986,
IDA's relations with the Government/PCEP were strained due to a breach'of



financial covenants under the two credits. This resulted in minimal
supervision efforts from IDA. Consequently, the project was completed in June
1987 after a delay of about 3 1/2 years (compared to Staff Appraisal Report
e,stiates). Another important lesson learned was that IDA should saintain
flexibility in determining whether the project covenants are being met keeping
in view the underlying objective of maintaining the financial viability of the
utility. IDA's approach in the proposed project reflects this flexibility by
recognizing alternative mthod  for achieving  financial viability, such as
reduction of fuel oil prices to economic levels, so as to minimize undue
taxation of electricity consumers. A completion report covering both power
projects has been prepared (OED Report No. 7816 of May 26, 1989).
11. THBENEFICIARY
A. F-ckttounid
2.01        The borrower of the proposed credit would be the Governrent of the
i      People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The credit would be on-lent
*      under a sub*idiary loan agreement to the beneficiary, PCEP.
2.02        In 1969, PCEP was established1 as a Government corporation under
the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. Later, in 1975, PCEP was made
responsible to the Ministry of Industryl/. In 1985, a uiew Ministry of Energy
and Minerals (MEK) was establishedV and in 1987, PCEP was transferred to MEM.
The divisions of responsibility between PCEP and the Government are as laid
down in Law No. 13 of 1979, which also applies to other Government
corporations.
2.03        PCEP is responsible for the power subsector in PDRY., The control
of PCEP's predecessor, Aden Electricity Corporation, was limited to the Aden
System only. PCEP acquired the Abyan Branch in 1970; the Mukalla, Lawder and',
Nudiyah branches in 1971; and the Seyun and Shehr branch4s in 1976. In 1982,
after commissioning the central diesel power station of the Wadi Hadramawt
Project (Credit 829-YDR), PCEP merged the Seyun Branch with the newly cr__ted
Wadi Hadranawt Branch.  In 1984, PCEP returned the Lawder and the Mudiyah
branches to the local authorities; in 1987, the Shehr Branch was enlarged to
'cover the five towns east of Mukalla (and nearby villages) which were
connected to the central diesel power station established under the Second
Power Project (Credit 1268-YDR). With the commissioning in 1989 of the 132-kV
Hiswa-Abyan (Ja'ar) transmission line, the electricity needs of the Abyan area
are being met from the Aden System.

2.04        PCIP is headed by the Director General wbo is also the Cbairman of
the Board of Managemnt (BN). Te appointmnt of the Director General is the
prro6gative of the Prime Minister. The affairi of PCIP are managed by the N,
which, in addition to the Chairman, consists of 13 mebers. Under las M.. 38
of 1969, the U should moet at least once evety two months, giving  threo dars
notice to Its menbrs.  In practice, the BK maets mort often tban the sinlmn
stipulated period of two months.
2. Q5       The Organization Chart, up to  anagemeant leveli)is shown in Aonnx
2.1. PCIP's oquity Is owned by the Government, wbich exerciss coontrol over
the corporation's major activities. FCP's NM is mare of a management
comittee than a policy-making body and has very little leverage in important
matters; these are referred to the Government (para. 1.09). Accordingly, the
Government approves PCEPIs operational budget, investment program, tariff
adjustments and borrowing.  Furthermore, thore are limitations on PCEP's
powers to award contracts. All Gqvernuent-funded contracts exceeding YD 5,000
(US$14,550) have to be approved by the Government's Centra(J Board of Tenders.
This situation, though not satisfactory, is typical of a corporation
functioning in a centrally administered economy.
2.06        PCEP is institutionally weak and has a shortage of skilled and
semi-skilled labor. The situation has been aggravated by the burden imposed
by the new facilities cosmi?sioned in the last six years (para. 2.08). The \
shortage of qualified staff affects project .mplementation and the operation
and maintenance of existing assets. IDA's involvement in two projocts
(Credits 829 and 1268-YDR) assisted PCEP in Improving this situation.  The
ongoing crash training program under Credit 829-YDR provides urgently peeded
equipment and consultancy services for training PCEP's staff in the operation
and maintenance of generation (diesel and stoam) aud distribution systes.
However, further assistance to PCEP in institutional natters is required in
view of the expanded role and increased responsibilities which PCEP has
undertaken. System planning continues to be weak for lack of qualified staff.
The technical wing of the planning section and the accounts section also need
more qualified staff. PCEP's inability to develop sound financial magement
practices is reflected in delays in the preparatlon and finalization of
accounts (paras. 4.02 and 4.04); top financial managers mut spiend a
disproportionate amount of time supervising routine accounting taskx (para.
4.05). PCEP's present salary structure (closely related to the salary
structure in the Government) is unable to attract adequately qualified staff,
and many posts remain vacant (up to 20X-30% of the sanctioned posts in some
units).' In spite of these shortcomings, PCEI's total staff strength (Aden and
branche*) has increased from about 2,000 in 1981 to about 3,200 in 1989 and in
likely to be 4,100 in 1996. Special efforts are necessary to ensure the
availability of qualified and experienced staff to satisfy PCEP's existing and
future needs.
2.07        PCE\ is fully aware of its institutional shortco ndgs.  It
initiated the first phase of a training prograu (crash training program) under
\



Credit $29-YDr, PCUP hap also sent technical and accoumttg staff abroad for
training. Due to limited funds under the two ealier IM  Cred1t  (829 and
1268-rnR), the second pbase1 of the training program could not be undertaken.
It would, therefore, be financed under the proposed project (pares. 3.26 and
3.27).
C.  C        iatin   acilities
2.08        During the last six years, PCEP has expanded rapidly.  It added
four power stations - Nansoura (64 NW), Hiswa (75 Ni), Qaraw (16 NW), and As
Shehr (6 NW). It also added the associated transmission and distribution
systea and introduced a new voltage level of 132 kV in its Aden System with
the comissioning of the 132-kY Hiswa-Abyan (Ja'ar) transsission line in 1989.
In addition, the Government made PCuP responsible for the management of the
desalinacion plant at Hiswa; the first phase of the desalination plant
(consisting of tro desalination blocks) was coamissioned in 1989. The burden
imposed on PCEP due to this rapid expansion is substantial, especially
considering the modest size of the utility. PCEP's total installed capacity
in 1989 was about 217 MW: 139 KW in diesel generation; 75 KW in thermal; and
3 NW in combustion turbines. It had about 370 km of 33-kV and 1100 km of
ll-kV transmission lines, and about 1800 km of low voltage distribution lines.
In 1989, PCEP generated about 562 GWh of electricity, purchased about 8 GCh
from ARC, and sold about 425 GWh to consumers. Auxiliaries in the power
stations consumed about 91 of generated energ  while line losses amounted to
about l8S on a sent out basis. About 791 of PCEP's total generationt' is from
its Aden System (including Abyan Branch) followed by the Wadi Hadramawt Branch
(101); the Nukalla Branch (81); and the Shehr Branch (31). After
comuissioning of the 132-kV Hiswa-Abyan (Ja'or) transmission line in 1989. the
Abyan Branch has ceased to generate since generation in the Aden System now
transits enough power to meet the demand in the Abyan atea.
2.09        PCEP's total assets' in 1989 were about YD 154 million (US$451.1
million): 811 were in the Aden system; 81 in the Wadi Hadramawt Branch; 52 in
the Shohr Branch; 41 in the Nukalla Branch; and 21 in the Abyan Branch.
PCEP's sales revenues in 1989 amounted to about YD 18.6 million (US$54.1
million); 131 of the sales were from the Aden system; 11 from the Wadi
Hadranavt Branch; 71 from the Nukalla Branch; 61 from the Abyan Branch; ahd 31
fron the Shehr Branch.

A. Project Orilgin. Objactives and Rationale for IDA, Financing
3.01        Ptj.oct OrQgin.  PCIP has experionced rapid expansion during tho
last six years (par  2.08); this has put severe strain on its lidited
operation end management facilities. Therefore, it is essential that PCEP
review its capabilities and ensure efficient operation of existing and newly
acquired assets before undertaking anv new projects. During implementation of
the two ongoing power projects under L)A credits, it Was agreed that PCEP
should consolldate and manage its existing and projected facilities more
efficiently before undertaking a new regional electrification project. In
this context, the Government/PCEP concluded that the Aden System
rehabilitation and line loss reduction measures in Wadi Hadramawt Branch are
urgetttly needed to improve PCEP's operational efficiency (para. 1.15). This
decision was reconfirmed by the Government/PCEP during the project
implementation review meeting in Aden in July 1986. The Government and PCEP
requested IDA to provide funding for a rehabilitation/line loss reduction
project that would assist PCEP in improving its operational efficiency and in
strengthening its technical and managerial capabilities.
3.02        Project gbiectives and Rationale for IDA Financing.  Project
objectives are to assist PCEP in: (i) meeting the incremental demand for
electricity in the Aden region by rehabilitation of the Aden System; (ii)
reducing line losses in the Aden System and in the Wadi Hadramawt Branch;
(iii) improving PCEP's finencial position; and (iv) improving the technical
and managerial skills of PCEP's staff. PCEP, which is responsible for the
power subsector, is institutionally weak (para. 2.06) and financially in bad
shape (paras. 4.11 through 4.14). The project objectives are in line with
IDA's subsectoral strategy of assisting PCEP to provide an efficient, reliable
and least cost electricity supply; an essential infrastructure for a strong
and sustainable economic growth. IDA's involvement in the Project would
provide: (a) a continuing dialogue with the Government/PCEP to focus
attention on the urgent priorities in the power subsector; (b) an impetus to
improve efficiency through rehabilitation: rational project investment and
prudent financial management; and (c) much needed foreign exchange to iwprove
PDRY's economy.  Given the setback to the economy caused by the events of
January 1986, floods in March/April 1989, and the difficult foreign exchange
position, the Government is unlikely to obtain the required foreign exchange
for the project from other coimercial sources.
B.  Project Description
3.03        The project\consists of the following components:



-19-
(A) Rehabilitation of the Aden Systoe to increase its operating efficiency
and substantially meet its increasing power demands up to 1996 through:
V   (i)  th, rehabilitation of six substations providing an
additional 72.6 NVA of transformr capacity;
(ii)      the addition of about 9 km of 33-kV and 13 km of 11-kV
cables;
(iii)      the addition of about 35 11/0.4 kV distribution transformers
with a total capacity of about 14 NVA;
(iv)      the provision of capacitor banks of about 71 KVAR capacity;
and
(v)      the provision of the first phase of the Aden System Network
Control Center comprising an efficient load dispatch
computer and a passive mimic system diagram.
(B) Loss reduction equipment at the Wadi Hadramawt Branch to increase its
operating efficiency and cover its power demand up to 1996 through:
(i)      the installation of 11 km of 11-kY line in Seyun area; and
(ii)      the provision of about 11 NVAR  capacitor banks.
(C)         Technical assistance to improve PCEP's technical and managerial
skills through:
Mi)      consultancy services to assist PCEP prepare bid documents,
bid invitations and evaluations of bids, and award contracts
for project components (A) anid (B);
(ii)      consultancy services for engineering supervision during
construction and commissioning of substation rehabilitation,
and the Aden System Netwdrk Control Center subcomponents (A
(i) and (v)]; and
(iii)      training equipment and consultatcy/expert services
(including training abroad of PCEP's staff/trainers and
assistance in procurement of training equipment) required
for training PCEP's staff in the efficient operation and
maintenance of PCEP's assets.
A full description of the three project components is provided in Annex 3.1.
C.  FeaAibility Studies and Status of Project Prenaration
3.04.       In 1986 PCEP appointed VEB Elektro-Consult (VEC), East Glrmany, to
carry out rehalilitation/loss ieduction studies for the Aden System and the



- 20 -
Wadi Hbdraawt Branch. In addition, PCIU appointed Harz and McLellan (K & N),
U.K. , to carry out the studies for: (a) the substation crash rehabilitatton
program for the Aden system; and (b) the Aden System Network Control Center.
VEC submitted their final reports in Septeiber 1987; 1 & N submitted theirs in
December 1987.
3.05        Two IDA missions (11/87 and 02/88) reviewed these reports. The
IDA review of th  VEC studies indicated that it vw  essential to reinforce
these studies, especially for the Aden Systes. Accordingly, IDA discussed in
detail with PCEP and the Government those technical and economic areas where
the studies needed to be strengthened. PCIP requested that VEC supplement
their studies, caking into account IDA's coments. The supplemental
information furnished by VEC was reviewed by IDA &nd found to be satisfactory.
IDA's review of the two studies carried out by M & N indicated that the
rehabilitation of the six substations is required to meet the growing power
demand of the Aden System. However, for the Aden System Network Control
Center, K & M had proposed elaborate facilities at a cost of more than US$&
millionIi The facilities are not commensurate with the size of the Aden
System and IDA proposed implementing the facilities in two stages. The first
stage (included in the project) would provide facilities for economic load
dispatch and a passive mimic diagram board of the Aden System that would be
housed in an already existing power station. Other facilities could be
provided under the second stage, when the system could afford to install
elaborate system control equipment.
3.06        Technical Assistance.  The project includes technical assistance
for: (a) preconstruction and construction phase engineering consultancy
services to assist PCEP in timely implementation of procurement and
installation activities under the project; and (b) consultancy services,
training equipment and training of PCEP's staff to improve PCEP's technical
and anagerial skills.  IDA discussed with PCEP the technical assistance
component (Annex 3.1) and, accordingly, included the technical assistance
needed for the project.  The component is described in sub-para. 3.03(C).  The
project components described in sub-paras. 3.03 (A) and (B) also include
technic-al assistance which consists of the provision of experts' services and
the training of PCEP's staff by the suppliers of major equipment. This
technical assistance would be included in the supply, and supply and erection
contracts.
3.07        The following summari#es the status of project preparation:
(a) Substation Dfsign. M & N have completed the detailed design
and layouts of the six substations under the substation crash
rehabilitation program (para. 3.04).

(c)  LI-d*/Snace Acquition   PCEP already possesses the land
required for the rehabilitation of the six substations
(par&. 3.16) and the space required for the installation of the
efficient load dispatch *quipment and passive aimic diagran board
(paras. 3.05).
D. Cct Estimates
3.08        The total projoet cost, excluding interest during construction
(US$3.1 million), is estimated to be about YD 5.8 million (US$17.6 sillion) of
which about 861, amounting to about YD 5.0 million (US$15.5 million), is in
foreign exchange. An exchange rate of I YD - US$2.91 has been used for
converting bse costs and pbysical contingencies from on currency to another.
However, calculation of the total project cost (including contingencies) has
been based on the assumption that purchasing power parity would be maintained
over the project implementation period. A summary of the cost estimates for
the Project is given below in Table 3.1 and detailed in Annex 3.2.

The base project cost is in May 1, 1990 prices as etinated by the consultants
VWC/K & K. and as reviewed by IDA. These ostimate  are based on experience
with recent contracts and are considered to be reasonable for this type of
project. The cost estimates do not include import duties and taxes as PCEP is
exempt from such duties and taxes for the project. Overall physical
contingencies of 10 are added except for; (a) the civil works of component A,
for which about 15X physical contingencies have been added; and (b) the
consultancy services portion of the technical assistance component for which
no physical contingencies are included. Price contingencies have been added
to the base cost plus physical contingencies on the following annual inflation
rate projections (based on IDA estimates):

It is estimated that about 120 man-months of consultancy services (at an
average rate of US$10,000/man-month) are required for the consultancy services
included in the technical assistance component.
E. Project;Financing Plan
3.09        The financing plan for the project is summarized in Table 3.2.
The financing plan as agreed during the preappraisal mission (02/88) presumed
that up to US$12 million of the foreign exchange cost would be covered by IDA
credit to the Government of PDRY and the balance, US$3.5 million of the
foreign exchange project cost, would be covered by the Goverbment in view of
the Government's intention not to have any cofinancing for the projectv. In
addition, the Government/PCEP would cover the local financing requirements of
the project amounting to about US$5.4 million. However, due to the financial
constraints caused by the recent floods (March/April 1989), the Government
requested IDA (telex of June 21, 1989 from MOP) to increase IDA's contribution
by US$3.5 million to US$15.5 million.  IDA stressed the limitation of
concessional IDA funding for the country and informed HEK that this issue be
discussed during ntegotiations when the position on the other two project-
related issues (management of HPDP and reduction of fuel oil prices to
international levels) would be clearer and the position regarding the
V   During discussions In July 1986, the Govertoent expressed Its 1ntentfon not to hav cofinsncingofor
the Project; as in the pest, PORY found considerable effort we required to coordinate the work of
cof1nwncing agencies end eke the credits/lonm fffqctiw.

Government funding for the project could Improve. In view of the actions
taken by the Gaovernwnt on the two project-related issues and availability of
IDA funding, durint negotiations, IDA agreed to increase its contribution for
the ptoject from US$12.0 dillion to US$15.5 million. PCIP would be expected
to cover about 891 of the total financing requirements for 1990-1996 througW
internal cash generation (para. 4.22) and, therefore, could contribute towards
local funding costs for the project. However, PCIP is required to ret aslde
into * Depreciation Fund an omunt equivalnt to its depreciation charge for
the year and to transfer to the Governent 701 of its not incom. while the
Depreciation Pund say be used for replacment and rehabilitation of easets,
there,is no legal provision to enable the fund to be used for debt servicing.
Therefore during negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government would
take all necessary seasures including allowing PCI? to utilize funds from the
Depreciation Fund for servicing its debts (para. 4.22).

Republic of Yemen at the standard IDA terms. The Government would on-lend to
PCEP at a fixed interest rate of 7. 75%1 for a term of 20 years, including a
five-year grace period. The foreign exchange risk on the IDA credit would be
borne by the,Government3, as was the case under the two previous IDA credits.
The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and PCEP
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed'IDA credit.

3.12        IDA financing is proposed for the folloving eight main procureent
packages:
K         (a) supply and installation of substation material and equipment
(including associated civil works);
(b) supply of distribution transformrs;
(c) supply of tranmission line material and cables;
(d) supply of capacitors (adjustble and fixed);
(e) supply and installation of the Network Control Center
equipment;
(f) supply of training equipment;
.g) engineering/consultancy services for the preconstruction
phase involving procurement of material and equipmnt for the
Project (except training equipment), and for the supervision
during construction and commissioning; and
(h) consultancy services for implementing PCEP's training program
(including assistance to PCEP in procureoent of training
equipm)nt), and supervision of the associated expert services and
training  abroad of PCEP's staff/trainers.
Except for small value items under (a) and (f), International Competitive
Biddingl/ (ICB) procedures, according to IDA's Procurement Guidelines, would
be followed for items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f); procurement of
technical assistance services,items (g) and (h), would follow IDA's Guidelines
tor Use of Consultants by World Bank borrowers. International Shopping,
according to IDA's Procurement Guidelines, would be followed for procurement
of small value items for: (i) instruments, relays and testing equipment
required for the rehabilitation of substations; and (ii) tools and instruments
for training equipment. Procurement following international shopping
procedures would involve obtaining at least three price offers for the
required goods from at least two eligible source countries and limited to
US$40,000 per contract and US$500,000 in the aggregate.
3.13        Direct contracting following IDA's Procurement Guidelines would be
followed for\obtaining instruments, relays and recorders required to match
existing equipment in the substations being rehabilitated.  Total foreign
W th respect to each contract estimted to cost the quivtelnt of US 100,0QO or oore PCEP 'would

e'pendltures under this procedure would be limited to about US$100,000.
3.14        before appointing  consultants for (g) and (h) above, YPCU would
submit to IDA a short list of consultants, according to IDA's guidelines, by
the sod of June nd July 1990 respectively. PCIP should invite offers and
award contract for the consultancy services by the end of November 1990 and
MNach 1991 respectively.
3.15        PCIP a ppointed EDF (following ID.'s guidelines) for the first
phase of the training program (crash training program) under Credit 829-YDt
[paras. 1.19(a) and 2.07)]. The crash training program was completed by March
1990. PCEP is now formulating the second phase of the training program which
is scheduled to comence from April 1991.
3.16        PCEP has acquired all the land necesoary for the rehabilitation of
the substations. However, a token provision of about US$0.2 million in local
currency is provided for land acquisition. PCEP would follow appropriate
regulatiorn prevailirJg in PDRY when acquiring any additional land that may be
required for the project. Since the land requirement, if any, for the
substations would "e very modest, no resettlement problems are foreseen.
3.17        PCEP has enough experience to install distribution transformers,
33-kV and 11-kV lines, and 11-kV cables using force account (to be funded by
the Government/PCEP). However, the cost of expert services for assisting
PCEP's staff to install capacitors (adjustable and fixed) at four to six
locations is included in the cost of the capacitors (para. 3.24). PCEP would
follow similar installation procedures at other locations using force account.
3.18        Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3.

3.19        The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed ower seven years
(1990-1996) on the following basis:
(a) 1001 of the foreign cost of the supply and installation
(including civil works) of substation equipment;
(b) 100l of the foreign (c.l.f) coat of the supply of
distribution transformers, transmission line materials and cables;
(c) 1OO1 of the foreign (c.i.f.) cost of supply and 1001 foreign
cost of expert services for installation of capacitors (adjustable
and fixed type);
(4) 1001 of the fo'eign cost of the supply and installation of
the Network Control Center equipment;
(e)  1001 of the foreign (c.i.f.) cost of supply of training
equipment;
(f)  1001 of the foreign cost of consultancy services to be
provided for the project;
(g) 1001 of the foreign cost of training abroad for PCEP
staff/trainers; and

procured for subptation and training equipment following
international shopping/direct contracting procedures.
3.20        The disbursement schedule (Ann.x 3.3) follows the Bankwide
standard disbursement profile for transmission and distribution projects. In
order to enable PCEP to effectively implement the project and to ensure prompt
payments to contractors and consultants, IDA would advance funds as needed to
a Special Account to be opened at the National Bank of Yemen for a maximum
amount of SDR613,000 (US$800,000), which is expected to cover IDA's share of
eligible expenditure over a period of four months. The Account would be
denominated in US Dollars and replenished against withdrawal applications of
at least US$100,000 equivalent. Applications with appropriate supporting
documentation should be submitted when approximately half of the maximum
allocated amount of the Account has been spent. All disbursements under the
project would be made against standard documentation, except for contracts of
less than US$40,000 equivalent. These would be claimed under Statements of
Expenditures; related documentation would be retained for review by IDA
missions and audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.  During
negotiations, the Association proposed and the Government agreed that the
Special Account would be audited annually by the Central Organization for
Control and Auditing (COCA) or by other *uditors acceptable to IDA. This
arrangement is ,cceptable to PDRY and is used for other IDA projects there.

expenditures incurred after May 1, 1990, for the activities of the consultants
contracted for preconstnrution phase assistance to PCI? (para. 3.14).
3.22        The Credit Closing Date vould be December 31, 1996.
I.  Project        ntation      Serviai   Plan
3.23                            ineerin  Services.  PCuP vould appoint
engineering consultants to assist them in the preparation of bid documents,
invitations to bid, evaluations of bids, and the award of contracts (except
for training equipment). The same consultants would also assist PCIP in
engineering design and supervixion during installation, and in comissioning
of equipment for suabstations and the Network Control Center (para. 3.25). For
this purpose PCEP has agreed to submit a short list of consultants and Terms
of Reference for IDA's review by the end of June 1990 and award the contract
by the end of November 1990 (para. 3.14).
3.24        Lines. Cables, Digtribution T ansformers and Capacitors.  PCEP has
experience in the installation of: (i) transmission (33-kV and 11-kV) lines;
(ii) cables; and (iii) distribution transformers.  In view of the scattered
nature of the works and the small cost of installing these items (about US$0.5
million), it would be economical for PCEP to complete the installation of
lines, cables and distribution transformers provided in the project by using
force account instead of awarding contracts following competitive bidding
procedures. The installation of power factor improvement equipment
(capacitors, adjustable and fixed) is spread out in the Aden System and Wadi
Hadramawt Branch. Furthermore, the installation is also to be carried out, as
required, over a period of about five years. Installation of the capacitors
(requiring about US$0.4 million) is not complicated and is repetitive in
nature. The supplier of the capacitor would send an expert to supervise the
initial installation of the capacitors at about four to six locations.
Thereafter, PCEP would be installing the capacitors on its own, according to
the system requirements.
3.25        SMbstations and Network Control Center.  PCEP would need the
services of consultants to supervise the supply and installation contracts for
the two project subcomponents - substation rehabilitation and the Aden System
Network Control Center. The Consultants assisting PCEP in procurement
activities would carry out this function (para. 3.23) and supervise training
of PCEP's staff by the suppliers of major equipment; the cost of such training
would be included in supply and installation contracts (para. 3.06).
3.26        Traininf EamguLent.  PCEP has procured certain training equipment
required for the first phase of the training program under IDA Credit 829-YDR.
Additional equipment required (about US$0.6 million) for the second phase of
the training program would be procured under the project, following ICB
procedures (US$0.5 million) and international shopping procedures (US$O.l
million).



-30-
3.27        ConsultancySrvces for Training.  PCEP completed the first phase
of the training progra, by March 1989 (para. 3.15). The consultants to be
appointed by March 1991 (para. 3.14), would assist PCIP for the second phase
of the training program covered under the project.  They would supervise and
provide expert services and would also provide overseas training for PCEP's
staff/trainers. In addition, the consultants would also assist PCEP in the
procurement of training equipment.
3.28        Proiect Management.  PCEP has the overall responsibility for
project management. Accordingly, PCEP has agreed to appoint a Ptoject Manager
for the rehabilitation of the Aden System (component A) and one for line loss
reduction in Wadi Hadramawt Branch (component B). Technical assistance for
training (component C) would be under PCEP's Director of Planning. He would
also be involved in procurement-related activities for the project, including
procurement of consultancy services for tlxe construction phase of substation
rehabilitation of the Aden System and for the Aden System Network Contrel
Center sub-compornents. During negotiations, agreement was reached with PCEP
regarding the proposed arrangement for project management.
3.29        Project Implementatiin and SuRervision Plan. The Project
Implementation Scnedule is given in Annex 3.4 with a project completion date
of June 30, 1996. Annex 3.5 gives the broad requirements for the project
supervision and monitoring. These would assist PCEP in managing the project
and in providing IDA with the information required during supervision of the
project.  The Association would supervise the project twice a year.  The core
team for the mission would comprise a power engineer and a financial analyst.
The core team would be joined, as necessary, by an economist or a technical
expert in transmission and distribution. About 14 supervision missions are
scheduled during the project implementation period and the total supervision
effort is estimated to require on an average about 10 staffweeks per year.
3.30        Environmental Asgects.  Environmental controls and policy
enactment activities are concentrated under the Ministry of Fish Wealth since
PDRY has a variety of fish, and fish exports are an important source of
foreign exchange. Consequently, clean environmental conditions for sustaining
fish life are vital to PDRY. The project would have no adverse effect on the
environment. Possible adverse aesthetic effects would be kept to a minimum by
the rerouting of overhead lines. The social environment and the quality of
life would be enhanced by bringing electrical services and street lighting to
domestic consumers. A reduction of line losses and the introduction of an
economic load dispatch would mean less generation and, therefore, less fuel
consumption at PCEP's power stations for meeting the same consumer demand. In
fact, to that extent, the project would reduce the pollution from PCEP's power
stations. In compliance with IDA policy, no polychlorinated biphenyl will be
used 'in any facilities funded under the project. Further, all facilities
supported under the project would adopt measures, acceptable to IDA, for: (a)
health and safety standards; and (b) emergency prevention, planning and
management.
3.31        Risks.  There are no maj9r risks associated with the proposed
Project. However, possible risks thAt could have an advErse impact on the



-31
rate of return on investment relate to delays which may be experienced in
implementing the project; as a consequence, the benefits of  .oss reduction
wodld be loes. The risk of project cost overruns is minimized since the
project cost estimates (including'price contingencies) are spread over sevetn
years, even though a project of a similar nature could be completed in five
years. Further, to reduce the risk of project implementation delays, pre-
construction and construction phase engineering consultancy services are
included to assist PCEP In the procurement, installation and commissioning
actlvities under the project. The load forecast for electriclty sales was
derived from very conservative assumptions (para. 1.13). In fact, it is lower
than the low load scenario proposed by the Consultants, Ewbank Preece, U.K.
who carried out the financial study under IDA Credit 1268-YDR. Given the
excess generation capacity (para. 1.14) and that the financial forecast for
1990 through 1996 is conservative, the risk of not achieving the financial
objectives is small. Any impact on th-e rate of return steaming from the
*bove-mentioned risks is, therefore, considered to be small.
IV. FINAE5
A. Accounting Systems
4.01k       PCEP's accounting systems, financial management, and internal
audit functions need substantial strengthening. Efforts to stretgthen these
functions, together with the proposed changes in fuel pricing policies, could
make PCEP a financially stronger organiLation. This Section describes and
evaluates the past and present status of PCEP's accounting systems, financial
management and internal audit functions and links them, where appropriate, to
financial performance, It also discussezs PCEP's future financial performance
taking into account both anticipated improvements in internal management
functions, fuel pricing and other policies being adopted by the Government.
4.x(2       Each of PCEP's four branches, as well as the Aden System, is a
self-accounting entity with its own assets and liabilities. The accounting
system is based on the accruals concept and is intended to be identical in all
branches. However, due to the lack of accounting procedure manuals and
internal training programs for accountants, different accounting treatments
are often accorded to similar items in different branches. The common
procedures currently being followed have evolved over time as a result of
experience and external training. The accounting problems tnat result from a
lack of standardized procedures and a shortage of skilled staff are often
reflected in delays in preparing and finalizing monthly and year-end accounts.
Substantial improvements have been made in accounting procedures since PCEP
took over the branches from independent power companies between 1970 and 1976.
Before then, branch accounts were virtually non-existent. Under the Second
Power Project (Credit 1268-YDR), PCEP and the Government agreed to establish,a
committee to value the assets and liabilities of the branches. The committee`
completed its work and PCEP's Administrative Board approved the findings of
the committee in March 1985, about two years behind schedule'. The results of
the committee's work enabled PCEP to reconcile the branch net assets with Head



- 39 *
Office Current Accounts und to r--establish accounting syste  in the
branches. Since then, there ha been   steady improvement in PCIP'  ability
to produce accounts with reduced delay.
4.03        Currently, PCIM is in the process of c auterizing its accounting
syst m. Its computerization program is divided into the following five
phases:
- Phase I - consumer billing and payroll applications;
- Phase II - general ledger, cost accounting and stock control;
- Phase III - personnel;
- Phase IV - fixod assets; and
- Phase V - plant maintonace.
Computerization of t'ie billing procedures for the Aden System (which accounted
for about 73X of PCEP*s sales in 1989) was completed in April 1986. The
computerized and rAnual systems were run in parallel for about two months
until the manual system was discontinued in June 1986. The payroll system was
completed in January 1987. Phases II and III are underway and are progressing
satisfactorily. The software programs for fixed assets and for maintenance
and statistical systems were tested and accepted by PCEP in September 1986 and
December 1987, respectively. However,implementation has been delayed until
the capacity of the existing cosputer can be adequately expanded and also to
allow programming and other problems that have arisen with installed systems
to be resolved. It is expected that adeq'late expansion of the computer
hardware will be completed in the secont half of 1990.
4.04        PCEP plans to computerize branch accounts as soon as sufficient
experience with computerized systems has been gained in its Aden System.
Computerization will, to some extent, help PCEP improve the timeliness and
accuracy of its accounting reports. However, training is needed to obtain the
full benefits of computerization, and will be provided under this project
(para. 3.03 (C)(iii)I.
B.  FiLsMiALMhanagamIu
4.05        PCEP's ability to develop sound financial management practices is
hindered by an acute shortage of appropriate skil's. The lack of skilled
staff means that top financial managers spend their time supervising routine
tasks, leaving them with little time for critical fiLvncial management tasks.
The absence of adequate accounting and management information systems and the
absence of formal performance evaluation mechunisas have also reduced the
potential level of good financial management. For example, while branches are
self-accounting entities with their own assets and liabilities and budgets,
there is no formal mechanism for evaluating their performance. The only
control nechaniss for tho branches is the budges, which is used mainly for
expenditure control. The operation of the revenue expenditure budget is
reinforced by a system of cash "limits' or rationing. The Head Office
deposits cash into the bran6hes' current accounts on the basis of monthly cash
budgets and does not allow them to utilize cash proceeds from accounts
receivable; these are banked in a Head Office current account from iich 



-33-
branches have no authority to make cash wLthdrawals.
4.06        The usefulness of the revenue expenditure budget is limited by
delays in the preparation of actual expenditures for comparison with budgeted
expenditatres. In addition, the methodology used in preparing the budgets is
not based on pro-set operational standards (i.e., on a unit cost basis). PCEP
is currently working on a new computerized budgeting system which will be
based on pre-set operational standards and will be less aggregative than tha
present systen. The project's. training component includes training for PCEP's
middle management staff in the areas of budgeting, cost accounting, stores
management and accounts receivable management.
C. Internal Audit
4.07        PCEP has an internal audit team consisting of four persons.   ince
its creation in 1984, the Internal Audit Department has relied on the help of
the Deputy Director General, Finance in drawing up its audit programs. The
internal audit function should be independent of the units being audited,
especially the finance function.  The mission recommended, and PCEP agreed,
that the internal audit function should be strengthened through special
training for the audit manager under this project.
D. External Audit
4.08        PCEP's accounts are audited by the Government's Central
Organization for Control and Auditing (COCA). Two persons from the
organization are permanently based in PCEP.  COCA's audits are very thorough
and acceptable to IDA, although delays are often encountered due to staff
shortages.
E. Insurance
4.09        PCEP's major generation, transmission and distribution assets,
uotor vehicles and cotputers are insured with the Yemen National Insurance
Corporation. The Yemen National Insurance Corporation carries reinsurance
policies with other international reinsurers. These insurance practices are
in accordaizce with sound public utility practices and are acceptable to IDA.
F. Past Financial Performance
4.10        Figure. 4.1 below summarizes PCEP's actual financial performance
during the period 1982-1989 and its projected performance during the years
1990-1996. The historical financial statements (1982-1989) are shown in
Aninexes 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.

Figure 4.1
The historical results exhibit marked annual variations for several reasons.
The substantial net loss in 1982, corresponding to a negative rate of return
of 61, reflected a doubling of fuel product prices in 1980, plus another small
increase in 1981, and a 20X increase in wages and salaries in 1981. The
improvement in 1983 was due to A robust 151 increase in sales as a result of
(a) the completion of new power facilities (Wadi Hadramawt Power Station) and
(b) new consumption growth stimulated by a high level of c onstruction
activity.  Also contributing to the improved performance were substantial
increases in higher priced commercial and industrial sales. The near break-
even performance in 1984 (earlier than the covenanted break-even year of 1986)
and the positive net income in 1985 resulted from tariff increases of about 61
and 101 in those years respectively. In 1986, sales and revenues declined
substantially due to political disturbances in the country, and PCEP's
improving profit trend was temporarily reversed. The 1987 results showed a
regaining of the improving profit trend and achievement of break-even
performance but this was reversdd in 1988 due to the comissionini of less
fuel-efficient power units at HPDP. The provisional 1989 income figures show
a substantial net loss as more power is being generated from the power plant
at Hiswa without commensurate levels of desalinato'd water production, thus
making the fuel consumption for power generation substantially higher than
other power plants in the Aden system [para. 1.19(f)].



35 -
4.11        The historical results indicate that PCEP was unable to meet the
financial objectives agreed to by itself and the Government under the First
and Second'Power Projects (Credits 829 and 1268-YDR). Under the First Power
Project, it was agreed that PCEP was to break even in 1980 and achieve a 21
rate of return (on rev*lued assets) in 1981. The rate of return was to
increase steadily so as to reach 8X in 1985, and interim targets for 1982,
1983 and 1984 were to be discussed with the Association. However, PCEP was
unable to achieve these targets for the reasons outlined above and the
finatcial objectives had to be revised under the Second Power Project. The
revised objectives were for PCEP to achieve break-even status in 1986 (that is
generate revenues from its operations adequate to cover its total operating
costs including depreciation on revalued assets and interest chargeable to
operations). This was to be accomplished by average tariff increases of 10l
in 1983, and 15X in 1984 and in 1985. The Government was also to fund the
foreign exchange costs of PCEP's investment program, with the exception of the
foreign exchange costs of the Second Power Project, through equity
contributions. At the same time, the fuel subsidy that had been provided to
PCEP following the 1980 and 1981 fuel products price increases was to be
gradually withdrawn and completely phased out by 1985.
4.12        During 1986-89, the improvement in PCEP's financial position was
less than anticipated (except in 1987) because the tariff increases
implemented by PCEP were not adequate to sustain the break-even performance.
Also, the political disturbances in 1986 contributed to PCEP's poor financial
performance in that year. Furthermore, when oil prices fell on the
international market in early 1986, the Government did not adjust the cost of
fuel to PCEP. As a result, the prices of fuel oil and diesel oil remained
respectively about 1.5 and 2.0 times as expensive as their international
levels. The high cost of fuel became a burden on PCEP's finances. IDA and
the Government/PCEP agreed to formulate another plan to address PCEP's weak
financial position. The atnalysis necessary for such a plan was complicated by
the expected commissioning of certain generation assets whose capital and
operating costs were difficult to estimate. The Government also felt that it
was necessary to fully investigate the scope for cost-reduction measures
within PCEP. Therefore, in 1986, the Government and IDA amended Credit
1268-YDR and required PCEP to conduct a financial study to find ways and means
to improve its financial performance. The study was completed in April 1987,
and IDA and the Government/PCEP discussed its findings in November 1987. The
main recommendations of the financial study were that (a) the prices of heavy
fuel oil and diesel oil charged to PCEP should be reduced to their
international equivalents; (b) PCEP should reach an agreement with the
Government on the reduction of arrears of accounts receivable due from the
Government and public sector agencies; (c) efforts should be made to reduce
line losses (of about 181 in 1989 to 121 by 1996); and (d) PCEP should improve
its cost control performance through the implementation of adequate budgeting
and costing systems. Recommendation (a) has already been implemented with the
Government's decision to reduce effective May 1, 1990, the prices of heavy
fuel oil charged to PCEP to approximately international levels.
Recommepdations (b) and (c) would be addressed under this project. Regarding
recommendation (d), PCEP has already started implementation (para. 4.03).



- 36 -
4.13        PCEP's existing tariffs are given in Annex 1.1 (page 2 of 6).
P(XP's tariffs have been increased about five tims since 1981.  The first
three increases in Septeoblr and November 1981 and again in January 1982
amounted to about a 391 average tariff increase (in nominal terms) withln a
year and raised the average tariff from 25.0 fils to about 34.75 fils per kWh.
However, these increases were not enough to compensate for the inereases in
fuol costs (para. 4.10). Thus, despite these increases, the Goverrment had to
provide a fuel oil subsidy starting in 1980 and 1981 to help PCEP meet its
accounts payable bills and had also to provide PCIP vLth operating subsidies
to cover accumulated losses up to the end of 1982 and for each year
thereafter. In 1984 and 1985 tariffs were further increased by about 61 and
10% respectively. These increases raised the average tariff from 39.7
fils/kWh to about 44.8 fils/kWh in 1985. Due to changes in sales composition
the average tariff level h*s since changed to about 43.6 fila/kWh at the end
of 1989. With effect from May 1, 1990, the average domestic tariff was
reduced (by about 291) from 33.7 file/kWh to 23.9 fils/kWh. Therefore, the
overall average tariff decreased to about 42.6 fils/kWh corresponding to about
1251 of the long run marginal cost of supply.

4.15        The improvement in PCEP's financial performance is predicated on
the assumptions that (a) starting in May 1990, PGEP would be charged the
equivalent of international prices for heavy fuel oil; (b) PCEP would not



- 37 -
suffr any financial losses as a result of desalinated water operations; and
(c) that electricity qariff increases (par&. 4A6) or equivalent measures
would be taken to ensure that, stirtink January 1, 1991, PCEP would achieve
break-even performanco in each year.
4.1          Regarding the pricing of heavy fuel oil, the Government has
already decided to base the prices of heavy fuel consumd for power generation
on its international price equivalents. Thus effective May 1, 1990 PCIP is
being charged for heavy fuel oil consumption in its power stations prices
which are approximately equal to international levels. Based on the bank's
projections of crude oil prices, the projections assume heavy fuel oil prices
of YD 37 per metric ton in 1990-91, YD 40/ton in 1992-95 and YD 49/ton in
1996. Despite the positive impact of the heavy fuel oil reduction on PC?P's
financial performance, PCEP is expected to incur a financial loss of about YD
1.9 Million in 1990 due to (a) a 29X average domestic tariff reduction (para..
4.13); (b) an average salary increase of about 291 implemented in March 1990
and a further increase of about 26X expected in June 1990 and (c) the effect
of inflation on costs of consumable and other revenue expenditures.
Therefore, to achieve break-even performance in 1991 PCEP would require to
take revenue enhancement actions or cost reduction measures equivalent to an
average tariff increase of about 111.  Further measures equivalent to average
tariff increases of about 51, 41 and 71 would be required to maintain break-
even in each of 1992, 1993, and 1996.
4.17        With regard to desalinated water operations the Government has
established a ministerial coiittee to consider the issue of management of the
desalination plant at Hiswa as well as the pricing basis for desalinated
water. The first two of the four desalination plant batteries started
comercial desalinated water production in the second half of 1989. The
management arrangements, production level and pricing basis for deu,alinated
water are important ispues because the investment for the desalination plant
(about US$281 million) is substantial and the production costs (both capital
and operating costs) result in a price for desalinated, water which is about 10
times PWC's projected average selling price to its custoners.  PCEP needs to
be protected from the negative financial implicattons of an investment outside
its nornal operations. Therefore, during negotiations the Government agreed
that PCEP would sell water at a price enabling it to recover the full cost of
desalinated water production. PCEP intends to maintain separate accounts for
the desalination plant of HPDP so as to properly refle,ct the financial results
of the desalination plant operationsuy. This is possible since with the
exception of fuel cost, all other operating costs of the desalination plant
(depreciation on revalued assets, salaries and wages, and chemicals) are
separately identifiable. With regards to the fuel cost, fuel consumption at
the rate of about 284 grams/kWh [para. 1.19 (f)] would be allocated for
electricity and the balance would be allocated for desalinated water
production. The total fuel consumption for production of water and
electricity is based on the assumption that one desalination block of HPDP
would be in operation producing 4.7 MNx/year of desalinated water.
TV TMdelInttion plant op eratin would be run n n -profit no-Lose bois.



- 38 -
Furthermore, high capital cost of the power plant HPDP is fully reflected in
PCP's financial projections.  PCEP's financial projections. therefore,
exclude the revenues and expenditures of the DesalitAtion Plant from its
income statements.
4.18        Accounts Receivable.  Tables 4.2 and 4.3 below show collection of
accounts receivable for PCEP as a whole and for the Aden System alone during
the period 1982-1989.

4.19        The bulk of PCEP's electricity sales are made in the Aden System
and accounted for about 741 of PCEP's total electricity' revenues in 1989.
PCEP's records provide a breakdown of tales, revenues and accounts receivable
between the Government and public sector and other consumers for the Aden
System pnly. The Government and public sector consumers are the dominant
consumer group accounting for between 65X and 751 of PCEP's total electricity
revenues. This group has, however, tended to experience cash flow problems in
the past. This is clearly reflected in PCEP's overall average collection
peiiod for its accounts receivable, which ranged from 5.1 months in 1982 to
8.4 months in 1989. In 1985, the average collection period for PCEP as a
whole and for the Aden System was 4.8 months. It then increased to 7.7 months
in 1986 due primarily to political events in that year, and as a result of
continued economic difficulties it has since increased to 8.4 months at the
end of 1989.
4.20        Airrears from  onsumers other than the Government and the public
sector are also high ( 6.6 months sales at the end of 1989) in the Aden
System). PCEP realizes the importance of tightening its credit cwntrol
functions, reducing its billing cycle, and improving its collection

procedures. It has, therefore, computerized its billit6g system in the Aden
System and expects to reduco the billing cycle from thre to two months. It
also expects to be able to implement it. disconnection pollcy for
non-governmental consurs more effectively, based on more up-to-date
information. Implementation of those measures should help to reduce arrars
from the non-Govervinent sector to the target of about 3 months sales. As for
arrears from the Govertment, public and mixe dctors, the Covern nt
delegation confirmd during negotiations that PCIP has submitted proposal. for
actions by the Govermment (including allowing adequate budgetary provisions
for electricity costs of its departmnts ) to ensur that arrears on accounts
receivable from the gover nent and the public sector do not exceed the level
of throe months sales.

Improvements in PCEPnts financial performance, itternal cash go*ration is
expected to contribute *bout 89Z of the total investment plan during the
period 1990-1996. However, becwuse PCqP is obliged to set aside into a
Depreciation Fund funds equivalebit to its depreciation charge for the year and
to transfer 70X of its net income to the Government, its gross funds from
inteimal operations are not direct y available for debt servicing, The
Depreciation Fund may be used for replacement and rehabilitation of assets and
for other purposes as may be authorized by the Ministry of Finance.   PCEP
would not be able to fully service its debt without utilization of the
Depreciation    d.  Therefore during negotiations agreement was reached that
the Government would take adequate measures in9luding allowlng PCEP to utilize
the Depreciation Fund for purpo"sl'of seeting its debt service obligations.
This project represents about 11 of the total investment program, and the
proposed IDA credit iould provide about 74X of the project's total financing
requirement. Overall, the investment plan is'reasonable and\its financing
plan is feasible.

4.23       Ereak-Evn Covenant. The break-even covenantl' as formulated
under the Second Power Project (Credit 1268-YDR) would be maintained for this
project. As a lesult of tariff increases implemuented by PCEP in 1984 and
1985, it nearly achieved break-even status in 1984 (earlier than the
covenanted break-even year of 1986) and fully met the covenant in 1985 and
1987. Its failure to meet the covenant in 1986 was attributable to a decline
in electricity sales due to political disturbances in that year. In 1988 and
1989, PCEP's financial performance was adversely affected by operation of
costly and fuel-inefficient power units of HPDP. Therefore, PCEP was unable
to meet the break-even covenant in those years. Reductions in electricity
tariffs and increases in salaries and other costs would contribute to PCUP's
inability to achieve break-even performance in 1990 despite the reduction in
fuel oil prices (para. 4.16). During negotiations the Government and PCEP
agreed to take all necessary measures to enable PCEP to achieve break-even
status in 1991 and in all subsequent years. Modest average tariff increases
(or equivalent actions) of about 111, 5X, 4X and 7X in 1991, 1992, 1993, and
1996 respectively would be required to achieve and maintain break-even
performance. These tariff increases would be required to enable PCEP to
generate adequate cash to meet PCEP's debt service obligations as well as to
provide adequate funds for replacements of its assets.
4.24        PCEP would prepare financial forecast by September of each year to
determine whether it would be able to achieve break-even performance in the
following year. PCEP would also use the results of the review to determine
whether its gro4s funds from internal operations would amount to at least 1.5
times its debt service requirements in the following year. In case the gross
funds from internal resources are expected to be less than 1.5 times its debt
service requirements, PCEP would refrain from contracting new long-term debt
obligations except with the agreement of the Association.
4.25        Accounts Receivable'.  PCEP plans to implement the measures
referred to in para. 4.21, which would help to reduce and maintain accounts
receivable from consomers other than the Government and the public sector at
levels not exceeding 'three months sales. The Government has also agreed to
take all necessary measures to ensure that PCEP's accounts receivable from
electricity sales are maintained at reasonable ievels at all times. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with PCEP and the Government on a
reasonable average collection period for PCEP's accounts receivable (about
three months sales).
4.26        Audit.  Past audits have been carried out by the Central
Organization for Control and Auditing, a state agency acceptable to IDA.
Under the Sedpnd Power Project (Credit 1268-YDR), there were separate

submission requiremnts for audited and unaudited accounts and for Aden
System accounts and other branch accounts. These requirements were necessary
to allow the branches more time in preparing their accounts, given the poor
condition of the existing accounting systems. However, following the
re-establishment of accounting systems in the branches, the branches should
now be in a better position to produce year-end accounts.  This should also
enable the unaudited accounts for the corporation as a whole to be available
within five months and the audited accounts to be available within eight
uonths of the end of the fiscal year, inetead of the ten months agreed upor in
the Second Power Project. During negotiations, -greement was reached that
PCUP would submit its unaudited accounts to IDA within five months and the
audited accounts to IDA within eight months of the end of the fiscal year.
V.  PROJE  JUSTIFICATION
5.01        The project is an integral part of PCEP's least cost investment
plan for 1990-1996 and would assist PCEP in efficiently meeting the future
demand for electricity. The investment plan (of which the Project is an
important component) yields an internal economic rate of return (IERR) of 11l
compared to an estimated opportunity cost of capital of 101.
5.02        Least Cost Justification.  The appraisal mission reviewed with
PCEP, the growth in demand for electricity and investments in generation,
transmission and distribution (para. 1.16). The review confirmed that
priority should be given to rehabilitation of the Aden System and reduction of
line losses, especially in the Aden system (including Abyan Branch) and Wadi
Hadramawt Branch. These two units of PCEP were responsible for abcat 901 of
its sales revenue in 1989. Rehabilitation of the Aden System is also needed
to satisfactorily meet future demand of electricity. The line loss reduction
and rehabilitation components proposed for the project would assist PCEP in
containing the line losses to a reasonable limit of 12X in 1996. The issue of
the on-going investment by the Government in HPDP is already discussed in
detail in paras. 1.13, 1.19 (f) and 4.17. During negotiations, the Government
assured that it would insulate PCEP from the adverse financial impact of HPDP
operations (para. 1.19 (f)). Accordingly, the economic analysis does not
consider investments (Annex 1.5) in desalination plant of HPDP. However, the
investments in the power plant of HPDP are considered for the economic
analysis.
5.03        Rate of Return Analysis.  Annex 5.1 gives in detail the
assumptions in calculating IERR. IERR was calculated for a time slice of
PCEP's electricity investwont program in tune with the projected incremental
demand for electricity over the\project implementation period (1990-96).
Further, the operation casts and benefits from the operation of the
desalination plant are excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity analysis was
carried out for determining the effect of an increase in the project cost by
151 (Case II), a reduction of sales benefits by 151 (Case III), and an
increase in fuel cost by 151 (Case IV). Further, analysis was also carried
out (Case V) to determine the effect on IERR of PCEP not implementing the



proped  teriff inerrs         -\es
S.O.        Other  reasrable costs include (a) non-ft *1 operation and
melateneee cs tos (O & 1) ad (b) fIl costs; baed an economic costs of
diesel .11 and heavy fuel oil (the principal fuel conumed by PCs?,s power
statio.). Tbe"  iosts were projected on the basis of Bank's international
oil price  In rel teru  till 1996. The fu l costs in the analyses presuo
that the line losses would be reduced from ibout 181 in 1990 to about 121 in
19X6 (Atnex 1.3).
5.05        Neasurable benefits include incremental sales revonues during the
project construction period (1990-96) *nd continuing during the lfe of the
assets. Since the existing and the proposed tariffs are above the long run
marginal cost of supply (LRIC), they have been taken as an indicator of the
consuamrs' willingneos to pay.
5.06        On the ba,is of above assumptions, the base case (Case I) yields
an IERR of about 11; Case II slightly below 111 (minimal impact); Case III
about 71; Case IV about 1OZ; and Case V about 61 (maximum impact) each. The
sensitivity  nalysis shows that IERR is sensitive to the reduction in sales
revenues due to: (a) P(EP not taking any revenue enhancement action to
maintain break-even financial target for the period'1990-1996; and (>)
vesduction in electricity sales. During negotiations, the Government/PCEP has
agreed to the break-even financial covenant. Regarding electricity sales for
1990-1996, a very conservative sales growth of 61 (para. 1.13) has been
considered for the period. Therefore, the risk of reduction in sales revenues
below the conservative projections for 1990-1996 is minimal. Tht benefit
etrsas in the ana4ysis does not fully captyare other non- measurable benefits
uch ax increased reliability of supply, av6ided costs o0 unserved energy, and
isproved operational and managerial efficiency of employees resulting from
technical assistance and training.
VI.  AlEHTS REACHED an  RECO2EDAIONS
I, 
6.01        The post-appraisal letter of July 19, 1989 requested the
Goverrment to consider, at. the earliest, the following two major issues
affecting PCEP's financial viability:
(a)  the proposal of charging international prices for fuel oil
sold to PCEP as of January 1, 1990 (paras. 1.19 (d) and 4.121; ond
(b) the proposals for the *mnageent of the Hiawa Power and
Desalination Plant to ensure that PCEP is insulated from the
adverse financial Impact of\desalination plant operation at Hiswa
[pars. 1.19 (f) and 4.17].
6.02        IDA requested the Government of PDRY to take decisiorls on the two
issues by October 1989 (i.e. prior to negotiations). Though late, the
Govern ent informed IDA on April 30, 1990 that:  (a) the fuel *il p1ices



45 -
charged to PCIP have been reduced as recommned by IDA; (b) it ha set up a
ministerial comnitte to report, to the Council of Kinisters, on the financial
implications of the RPDP operations and alternative use of desalinated water;
and (c) it has directed PCIP to submit a report, to the Council of Ministers,
for revaluation of HPDP assets at replacemet cost. During negotiations.
agreement was reached, satisfactory to the Association, regarding insulating
PCCP from the adverse financial impact of H9DP operations and on other
project-related issues. It was agreed that PmY would:
(a) cause PCIU to operate the desalination plant of HPDP at the
mininum level necessary to maintain the equipment in good working
condition pending the completion of a review by PDOY of the
alternative uses of desalinated water [para 1.19 (f)3;
(b) cause PCEP, not later than June 30, 1991, to revalue the
assets of HPDP on the basis of a methodology satisfactory to the
Association [para. 1.19 (f)];
(c) bear any losses incurred by PCEP and NC fron the sale and
purchase, respectively, of desalinated water production at HPDP
[para. 1.19 (f)];
(d)  take all measures necessary on its part to ensure that PCEP's
accounts receivable from its departments, public and mixed
enterprises, and cooperatives do not exceed the level of three
months of average sales (para. 4.25);
(e) take all measures necessary, including easures permitting
PCEP to utilize its Depreciation Fund to enable PCEP to meet its
debt service requirements (para. 4.22);
(f) take all measures necessary on its part to ensure that PCEP
meets its obli3ations pursuant to paras 6.03 (a), (b) and (d)
below; and
(g) the Special Account would be audited annually by the Central
Organization for Control and Auditing or by auditors acceptable to
IDA (para. 3.20).
6.03       Durlng negotiations, agreemnt wa reached with PCEP that PCEP
would:
(a) meet the break even target in 1991 and each year thereafter
(para. 4.23);
(b) obtain the Association's prior consent to any further
borrowings whenever its internal cash generation is not sufficient
to cover its debt service at lest 1.5 times in any future year
(para. 4.24);
(c) submit to the Association the unaudite4 accounts for PCEP



- 46 -
within five months and the audited accounts to the Association
within eight months after the *nd of each fisca& yer (para.
4.26);
(d) take measures to ensure that its accounts receivable from
consumers do not exceed three months of average electricity sales
(para. 4.25);
(e) take measures to put into effect not later than December 31,
1990, an action plan, satisfactory to the Association to reduce
the level of PCEP's line losses (para. 1.15 (g)]; and
(f) appoint project managers. satisfactory to the Association,
for implementing the project (para. 3.28).
6.04        The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to IDA,
between the Government of PDRY and PCEP (para. 3.10), shall be a condition of
effectiveness.
6.05        Subject to the above, the proposed project is recomended for an
IDA Credit of SDRll.9 million (US$15.5 million) to the Government for a term
of 40 years with a grace period of 10 years. The Government would on-lend the
proceeds of the Credit to PCEP for a term of 20 years including a 5 year grace
period.
6.06        Annex 6.1 gives the list of selected documents and data available
in the Project file.

Caculation Of DoM  i  Marginal Cost (1ZMCI
1.    In this section, a'vrage electricity tariff based on the long run
marginal cost (LRKC) of electricity for PCEP as a wholeJ has been calculated
and compared with the existing average tariff. The calculations show that the
existing average tariff is 25X above the average tariff based on LRDC. Key
assumptions used in the analysis are outlined below.
2.    Marinal Capacity Cost Of Generation:  The marginal cost of electricity
supply is the change in total cost of service stmuing from a small change in
demand. In the short run, the installed capacities of the system are given
and change in demand leads to changes in costs of fqet. In the long run,
however, investments are normally to satisfy the increased demand. In PDRY,
an increased demand during peak periods would usually require additional
diesel capacity., The basic assumptions used for calculating marginal capacity
cost at generation are as follows:
Investment cost         : YD 318/kW  (c.i.fAden, exchange rate
US$1-YD 0.344 in 1989)
Discount rate           : 10X
Equipment Life          : 18 years
Reserve Margin          : 30X
0 & X costs             : 21 of investment cost.
Auxiliary Consumption
in the Power Stations : 10l
The derived oarginal capacity cost at generation is YD 64.52/kW/year.
3.    Mginal Enexay_Cost:  Except foi. the Aden System, diesel plants are
used for meeting the system demand during the base and peak load hours. While
in case of the Aden System, we have presumed that one desalination block would
be in operation at HPDP during 1989 through 1996. Therefore, steam power
generating units of HPDP would provide part of the base load generation. The
balance generation requirements, for the base load and peak load would be
provided by the diesel units. The marginal energy cost is calculated as the
weighted average of peak and off-peak energy costs. Based on the donestic
fuel prices (constant at 1989 prices) it amounts to 15.48 fils/kwh as against
10.10 fils/kwh based on the international level of prices (c.i.f. plus in-
land transportation and handling).

M4anla itv Coi                                    Distribution:  Long run
average incremental cost mthod ha been used as a proxy for the strict LIRC
of tranuission and distribution (T & D) investmwnts as these investments tend
to be indivisible or lupy. T & D investmnts, in real 1989 prices and
incremental loads are projected for the yers 1989 through 1996. Details of T
& D investmnts are provided in Amex 1.5 while the incremental loads are
derived from the load forecast for the period 1989-96 (Annex 1.2).

5.    Based on the above information and the average incremental cost
procedure (AIC), the narginal capacity cost of transmission and distribution
per kW is calculated as the ratio of the present value of T & D investment (YD
17,001 Thousand) divided by the present value of incremental demand (36 NW).
The relevant assumptions are as follows:
Useful Life of T&D Facilities:  30 years
0 & K Costs                      2X of T & D Investments
Discount Factor              : 10I
T & 6 Losses                 : 18X in 1989 and for other years as
given in Annex 1.3.
The resulting marginal capacity cost of transnission and distribution
is YD 64.14/kW/year.
6.    Sumary of LRNC: Assuming a load factor of 602 for all customers, the
long run marginal cost per kWh averaged over peak a*:d off peak periodi in 1989
are ausuariied below:

(D'etails of the Proiect CQgmonents
1.        R      Qrolert Origi.   PCEP's total installed capacity at the end of 1989
was about 217 MW; 167 KW was in the Aden System; 20 MW in the Muldalla Branch;
16 MW in the Wadi Branch; 8 MW in the Abyan Branch and 6 MW in the Shehr
Branch.  About 58 MW of additional capacity is estimated to be installed up to
the end of 1996.  During the saie period, PCEP's sales would increase from
about 425 GWh ih 1989 to 678 GWh in. 1996. Out of total sales of 425 GWh in
1988; about 731 of sales are in the Aden System; 11 in the Wadi Hadramawt
Branch; 71 in the Mukalla Branch; 61 in the Abyan Branch; and 31 ii the Shehr
Branch. In 1996 the Aden System'(which from 1989 would include sales from the
Abyan Branch) wou2d accoutt for about 79X of total sales, followed by 101 from
the Wadi Hadramawt Branch; 7X from the Mukalla Branch; and 41 from the Shehr
Branch. The Aden System has,old, undersized equipment in the substations an'd
an inadequate transmission line capacity. With the existing system set up, it
is not possible to meet the future demands of the Aden System through 1996.
On the other hand, the Wadi Hadramawt Branch which was established in 1982,
has, in general, adequate transmission and distribution line capacity.
However, it is essential to install adequate power factor improvement
equipment (capacitors) to counteract the poor power factor associated tith the
growth in electricity sales to irrigation consumers and to maintain future
line losses within reasonable limits. Therefore, it was decided by PCEP and
the Government to give priority to a rehabilitation and loss reduction project
covering the Aden $ystem and the Wadi Hadramawt Branch instead of a
regional/rural electrification project. The proposed project would assist
PCEP in improving its financial position wit~h minimal tariff increases. Since
the Aden System and the Wadi Hadraaawt Branch accounted for about 891 of
PCEP's sales in 1989, and would also account for about 891 of PCEP's sales in
1996, it was considered appropriate for PCEP to concentrate on these two
administrative units of PCEP (given the limited IDA credit available for
PDRY).
2.        Project Preparation.  PGEP appointed the consultants, Preece Cardew
and Rider (now Ewbank Preece), U.K., to carry out the Aden Power System
Development Study. The study, completed in 1982, brought out the need for:
(a) reinforcing the transmission lines; (b) augmenting the substation
transformer capacity; (c) replacing old undersized switchgear in a number of
substations with higher capacity switchgear at a number of substations to
improve the reliability of the Aden System; and (d) improving the power fa4tor
of the Aden Systen by installing capacitors and, as a consequence, maintaieing
line losses at a level of about 121. PCSP, for want of funds, could only
partly reinforce some of the 33 kV 4nd 11 kV transmission lines. Ip 1986/87

PCI? appoint¶d the consultants, Marx and McLellan (K & X), U.K., tokeomplete
the design for the crash rehabilitation of six 33/ll-kV substations (Shenax,
Al Manara, Block 80, Taahi, Nedina Asheab and Lahej). The consultants
*ubmitted their report in September 1987. For the rehabilitation of the
transmission and distribution notwork in tho Aden system, PC?P appointed VEC
(para 3.04 of the *idn report) io carry out the study for the Aden Systes
rehabilitation (including loss reduction). The consultants (VEC) also carried
fiut line loss reduction studies for PCIP's Wadi Hadr_mawt and Abyan Branches.
Other PCEP concern was optimizing generation In the Aden System shared by the
Hisw! (thermal) and Nansoura (diesel) Power Plants taking into account the
desalination water production schedule of the Hiswa Desalinaticn Plant.
Furthermore PCEP introduced in the Aden System, a voltage level of 132-kV
(against 33lkV till 1988) for the first time with the comissioning of
Hiswa-Ja'ar 132-kV transmission line in 1989. In order to have a reliable
system operation of the Aden System, PCEP appointed 1 & H to carry out the
study for the Aden Network Control Center.' H & X completed the study and
submitted the report in Deceober 1987.
3.        Technical Review.  The IDA missions (11/87 and 02/88) reviewed four
studies - two completed by VEC and two completed by H & M. VEG studies were
incomplete and needed to be reinforced, especially the study of the Aden
System.  VEC study of the Aden System recomended:  (i) the rehabilitation of
the substations; (ii) the rehabilitation of transmission lines; (iii) the
installation 6f capacitors to reduce line losses ; and (iv) the installation
of additional transformer capacity. VEC estimated that line losses in Aden
System (which are at present about 171) would increase to abo4t 261 in 1995;
with the implementation of VEC's recomendations, the losses in 1995 would
drop from a projected 26X to 191. The mission considered VEC's estimate of
19X line losses in 1995 (after investing about US$14 million for the
rehabilitation of the Adeni System) as high, and reqiiested from PCEP additional
information including revised load flow diagrams. PCEP requested VEC to
supplement the study taking into account IDA's coents. According to the
suppLeuental report submitted by VEC, the line losses in 1995, after
rehabilitation of the Aden System, would be reduced to about 121. The
supplemental report was reviewed by IDA and found to be satisfactory. IDA'^
review of the two studies carried out by K & K indicates that the
rehabilitation of the six substations proposed by K & M is necessary to meet
the growing power demand till 1996. However, for the Network Control Center,
K & M had proposed elaborate facilities (at a cost of more than US$8 million)
which included: (a) the remote control of 26 substations; (b) a supervisory
control and data acquisition system (SCADA); (c) an elabora@.4. coomunication
system; (d) associated computers and software for load forecWasting, network
security and economic load klispatch; and (a) an elaborate building to house
the Network Control Center. IDA's review indicated that the proposed
facilities are not coimensurate with the size of the Aden System and it is
proposed to implement the facilities in two stages. The first stage (included
in the Project) would provide economic load dispatch facilities fir the Aden
5ysten and a passive mimic diagram board of the Aden System to be housed in
one of the existing power stations. Other facilities could 16* provided under
the second stage when the systen could afford installation of an elaborate
system -of control facilities.

(A)(iv) of the Aden Systen rehabiliLtaton; and
(ii)    consultancy servicai for PCRP's second phase of training,
necessary training equipmnt, and overseas training for PCEP's
staff/trainers. These components are discussed in detail in
the following paragraphs.
5.           -nonnt (A) ill  Substation.  The substations
proposed for rehabilttation are Shenaz, Al Mey ra, Block 80, Tawahi, Medina
Ashaab, and Lahej. Rehabilitation would involve the following:
(i)    at Shenaz - 33-kV panels (2), 11-kV panels (20) and two
transformers with 15 EVA capacity each;
(ii)'.    at Al Eanara - 11-kV panels (13) and two transformers with 10
EVA capacity each (to be shifted'from Alock 80 substation);
(iii)    at Block 80 - 11-kV panels (17), 1.3 km cable (for diversion of
existing l1nss) and two transformers w4th 15 EVA capacity each; '
(iV)    at Tawahi (Stem_r Point) - ll-kV panels (12);



Pae 4 of S papa
(v)    at  edineAshaab   33-k? panels (9), and 11-kV panels (15); and
(VI)    at Leb  -- 33-kV pawls (9), II-k? paels (11) and two
trasformrs with 6.3 NVA capacity each.
6.                       (A)     so   _        i    i. The sub-component
involves:
(a) 13 km (Hedjuff to Steamer Point) of Ul-k?. 73 XL?U cable;
(b)  9 km ( Shenaz to Crater) of 33-kV, l50mm XLP? cable; *ednd
(c)  fistribution transformers - one of 50 kVA, one of 100 kVA, four
of 200 kVA, 11 of 300 WA, 15 of 500 kVA and three of 800 kVA.
7.        Suh-cgm2oW=  (A)(iii): emmacitors. Automatically adjustable
capacitors - 68 banks of 240 kVAR each, 68 banks of 320 kVAR each and 68 banks
of 480 kVAR to be installed from 1990 through 1995.
8.        Sub-comoonent (A  iv)  Network Control Center.  As mentioned in
par-l 4, the first phase of the Network Control Center would consist of a
computer (hardware plus software) for efficient load dispatch and a passive
mimic mosaic board representing the Aden System. The equipment could be
installed either in the available space at the Hiswa or Nansoura power
station, whichever vould be convenient from the point of view of comeunication
facilities. Economic dispatch, when functionAl, could yield a fuel saving of
up to 5X and would fetch maxinum benefit for the investent.  The passive
mimic board would assist load dispatchers: (i) in properly understanding the
system in operation; and (ii) in giving appropriate instructions over the
phone to substation operators to carry out the desired operations at the
substations. Later, when thi system grows and adequately trained staff is
available, the second phase involving Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) and remote control of substations coakld be introduced.
9.        Sub-component MM)(: Line Reinforcemant- Vai-Hdrmw ranch.
The sub-cToponent consists of a new 11 km of 11-kV, 100.', ACSR transmission
line in Seyun area.
10.       Sub-cmONQAn  (MMO QC&citoXs (adjutable and fixed). The
sub-component consists of:
(a)  automatically adjustable capacitors - 3 banks of 180 kVAR, 10
banks of 320 kVAR, and one bank of 480 kVAR; anA
(b)  fixed capacitors - 80 banks of 40 kVAR, 45 banks of 60 kVA*,
and 9 banks of 100 kVAR.
11,.      Sub-conont (C)(L): Eniering                   SeMdes. Engineering
concultants srvices are required for:

t?Page 5 of 5 pagp
(a) pro-construction phase consultancy *ervies (about 28
mn4-onttas) to assist PC8* in preparation of bid documents,
evaluatlon of bids, snd award of contracts for Project
components (A) and (5); sad
(b) construction phase consultancy services (about 52 man-months)
to assist PCIP in ngineoring design, snd supervision during
construction and conmissioning of the sub-components for
SubstatioAi Rehabilitatlon (A)(i) snd the Network Control Center
(A) (iv).
12.       Sub-comnonent (C)(ii)  Training   The sub-component has two itms -
training equipment and consultancy services (including training overseas for
PCEPI's staff/trainers). About 40 man-months of consultancy services are
included for this purpose. The consultants would:
(a) assist PCEP in preparation of the bid documents, bid evaluation
and award of contracts for the training equipment;
(b)  provide the necessary experts for training PCEP's
staff/trainers in Aden;
(c) supervise the experts and the training program; and
(d) provide and supervise overseas training for PCEPI's
staff/trainers.
13.          Force Account. PCEP has enough experience in the installation of
distribution transformers, 33-kV and 11-kV lines, and 11-kV cabies using force
account (para 3.26 of the main report). However, for the installation of
capacitors, the cost of expert services for assisting PCEP's staff in
ins* ling capatitors (adjustable and fixed) at four to six locations ia
included in the cost of the capacitors. PCEP would follow similar
installation procedures at other locations using force account.

(a) Electricity sales forecasts (GWh) were derived from projections of
energy demand prepared by the consultants for the financial study in 1986-87.
Che demand projections took into account historical consumption patterns and
planned agricultural and industrial schemes and were reinforced by a power
market survey. The consultants study produced high, medium and low demand
scenarios representing 9.71, 7.81 and 6.41 average sales growth over the
period 1988 to 1995 respectively. The mission together with PCEP officials
reviewed the forecasts taking account of actual sales for 1987 through li89
(not available at the tine of the consultants final report) and agreed on the
above sales estimates which shows an average growth rate of 5.91 over the
period 1989-96. The projections show that electricity sales will grow at a
declining rate except in 1994 and 1995 when significant agricultural and
industrial qchemes are expected to commence operations.
(bj Average tariffs for electricity sales are based\on the requirement
for PCEP to generate adequate revenues in each year starting in fiscal year
1991 to cover its total operating expenses including depreciation calculated
!       on revalued assets and interest chargeable to operations.
2. Other Operatigg Revenues are estimated to grow on average by 5.51 p.a.
between 1990-1996.
3. Fuel Exeenses. The two principal fuels used for power generation are
hlavy fuel oil and diesel oil. The fuel expenses have beehn projected by the
mission on the basis of pricing, and specific fuel consumptiop data for PCEP's
generation plants as provided by PCEP. The projections are based on the price
of htavy fuel oil of YD 37.0 per metric ton (effective May 1, 1990) as
receitly decided by theeCouncil of Ministers. This price is close to the
international equivalent of about YD 35/metric ton. It is further assumed
that the prices of heavy fuel oil will be reviewed ar4 adjusted on a regular
basis in future years so as refleet tne ipternational levels.  Vith\ respect to

diese oil, the projections assue that PCIP will continue to pay about YD
102.31 per metric ton which is about double the interational lewl.  Tt 
i_act of the high price of 41sael oil on PCRS finencas is not aignfificant
since Uesel oil 6onstitute iMly about 131 of the fuel used for por
generation.
4.          _r        PM  purchas*s A  odest  munt! of powr from the Yemn
iiational Oil Company (about 8 GHh p.a.). PCIP expects to cease purchasing
power from YNOC by the end of 1990.
5. Salaries and M&&ts are projected to increase by about 9.61 p.a. during
1990-1996 i cluding about, 29X increase already implemented in 1990 and a
further 261 oxpected in 1990 to bring PCEP's salaries and wages on par vith
those working in the electricity undertaking in the Yemen Arab Republic.
Excluding the 1990 salary increases, the ovorall salary level is expected to
increase by about .5 per annum. This increase of 5X per annum is reasonable
and comparable with projected inflation rates of 3X in 1990-1992, 3.5Z in 1993
and 1994, 3X in 1995 and 31 in 1996, and reflect the Government's commitment
to restrict public sector expenditures.
6. Ppreciatign is computed at so average annual rate of about 5.81 of gross
fixed assets in se7ice during the year as revalued annually.
7.  Interest Exenses.  Interest has been calculated on average amounts
outstanding during the year for each loan on the basis of agreed interest
rate"  mnd including comitment charges on undisbursed funds were applicable.
Interest added to construction hap been calculated on an actual basis, i.e.
interest on loans for capital exp6nditures is capitalized during the physical
construction period.
B. Balance Sheets
1. Gross Fixed Assets in Service are revalued to reflect current costs  As
the bullk of the assets" about (901) in value are of foreign origin, andL
local inflation estimates automatically adjxkt the value of the for foreign
component for exchange rate changes which pay result from the differential
between local and foreign rates of inflation, the local inflation estinates
were used to revalue the assets from year to year.
2. Ia ala tijnaseyu represent surpluses arising on account of revaluation
of f.xed assets.
3. I.uMM zra are eitimat*dhto grow at the same rate as electricity sales
growth.

1.      Tbe economic analysis was carried out on th  basic of tbe tim  slice
of the electric poer inemt  nt progrm  (Anue 1.5). The progr   is
estimated to have an internal economic rate of return (Ina) of 11.12 with a
net present value of YD 3.15 million. The transmission and distribution
component of the project consists of a numbar of dispersed items for which
benefits are not specific to a region or a group of consumra. Therefore i,,:
is not convenient to calculate IER of this project in isolation from the rest
of the power invstment program s    sic asumptions use4 for this analysis are
oulined below.
2.       ggat&. Costs include iLvestment expenditures of (i) capital
(ii) incremental non-fuel operations and maintenance (O & H) and
(iii) incremental fucl, all at 1990 prices. It also includes replacement cost
of tvA diesel unitsand transmission and distribu4ion (T & D) facilities of
PCIP whose useful life would be over after 1996.
(i) The inestment outlays for capital include costs of generation
end transmission and distribution. Costs of generation comprise units which
woul4 be commissioned between 1990 through 1996. However, investment costs of
the dealination blocks at Hiswa during 1990-91 are excluded from the analysis
for the reasons given in para 5.02.
(ii)  Incremental 0 & H costs represent 22 of cumulative capital
costs of genoration, transmission and distribution.
(iii)  Incremental fuel costs are based on the data given in Table
2.1 below. The projected prices of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and diesel oil art
based on the Bank's projections for fuel prices (c.i.f.). The fuel prices also
Include local transportation and handling costs to PCI?.
