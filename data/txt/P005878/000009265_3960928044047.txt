MENORANDUN AND RECOOIENDATION OP THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERN&TIONAL DEVELOPNENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN (PDRY)
FOR A TMIRD POUR PROJECT
1.          I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to PDRY in the amount of SDRl1.9 million (LS$15.5 million
equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would help finance the Third Power Project
estimated to cost US$20.9 million. The Government of PDRY and the Public
Corporation for Electric Power (PCEP) would contribute the remaining US$5.4
million of the project financing.
2.          Background.  PDRY is a country of limited resources.  Its economy
depends heavily on external resources, especially foreign aid and workers'
remittances, for investment and consumption. During 1981-1985, GDP (in real
terms) grew at 4.3X a year. This growth was based primarily on inflows of
workers' remittances and the expanded production capacities in the
agricultural, fisheries and manufacturing sectors. However, since mid-1985,
economic growth has suffered serious setbacks due to factional disturbances in
1986 and floods in March/April 1989. Furthermore, the recent decline in
workers' remittances and foreign aid has curtailed economic activity and
resulted in reduced investments; as a result, between 1985-1989, there was
virtually no growth in real GDP. A return to sustainable economic growth
requires reforms aimed at improving the climate for savings and investment,
strengthening institutions and increasing their output, and improving the
efficiency of the productive sectors. A well functioning infrastructure,
especially an efficient, reliable and least cost electricity supply, is
imperative for strong and sustainable economic growth.
3.          PCEP is responsible for the power subsector in the country.  In
1989, it owned about 80X of the installed generation capacity in PDRY and
generated 84X of the electrical power in the country; the balance was produced
by the Aden Refinery Company (112) and other local agencies (5X). Major
issues in the power subsector relate to the institutional weakness of PCEP,
excess generation capacity, and financial viability (including high line
losses and the high cost of inputs). The transmission and distribution
network of the Aden System (including the Abyan area), which accounts for 83X
of the corporation's total assets and 791 of its electricity sales, is more
than 25 years old. The equipment at the important substations needs to be
replaced to reliably and adequately meet future demand. In addition, the Aden
System needs power factor improvement equipment to contain the system line
losses (currently about 18X) to a .easonable level of about 121. The Wadi
Hadramawt Branch serves a priority rural area for agricultural production and
is responsible for about 102 of PCEP's electricity sales. The future
irrigation pumping to be connected to the electrical network of the branch
will require power factor improvement equipment to be installed to ensure that
the line losses are contained at no more than 142, which is considered
acceptable for a rural network. The proposed project has a high priority in



- 2 -
the power subsector and would focus on these two areas, Aden (including Abyan
area) and Wadi Hadramawt, which are responsible for about 90X of PCEP's
electricity sales.
4.          PDRY has no known commercial energy resources, although
hydrocarbon deposits are currently being explored. IDA credits totaling
US$21.5 million financed three projects in the energy sector: one for
petroleum exploration in the petroleum subsector (Credit 1050-YDR); and two in
the power subsector (Credits 829 and 1268-YDR). The projects, which have been
completed, assisted PDRY in: (a) promoting oil exploration activities in the
country; (b) developing an electrical network at both the Wadi Hadramawt and
Shehr branches to meet the growing demands in the two regions; and
(c) providing technical assistance and training PCEP staff in efficient
operation and maintenance of PCEP's assets. From the Project Completion
Reports prepared for these three operations, the following important lessons
were learned: (a) care should be exercised in planning and promoting external
interest in exploration and in adhering to the project implementation
schedule; (b) greater intersectoral coordination is essential for effective
project implementation; and (c) IDA should be more flexible in permitting
alternative means to achieving financial viability of the utility. These
lessons are being taken into account in the design of other projects in the
sector.
5.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  PCEP has experienced rapid
expansion in generation during the last six years; about 742 (161 MW out of
217 MW) of its existing generating capacity was added In this period.
Therefore, it is essential that PCEP review its capabilities and ensure the
efficient operation of existing and newly acquired assets before undertaking
any new projects. Accordingly, the Government/PCEP accords a high priority
to: (i) the rehabilitation of the Aden System; (ii) a reduction of line
losses in the Aden System; and (ili) restricting future line losses in the
Wadi Hadramawt Branch to a reasonable level of 142. This is also in line with
IDA strategy and priorities for the power subsector. IDA involvement in the
project would provide: (a) a continuing dialogue with the Government/PCEP to
focus attention on the urgent priorities in the power subsector; (b) an
impetus to improve efficiency through rehabilitation, the reduction of line
losses, rational project management and prudent financial management; and (c)
assistance to PCEP for institutional improvements.
6.          Project Obiectives.  The proposed project would assist PCEP in:
(i) meeting the incremental demand for electricity in the Aden region by
rehabilitation of the Aden System; (ii) reducing line losses in the Aden
System and in the Wadi Hadramawt Branch; (iii) improving PCEP's financial
position; and (iv) improving the technical and managerial skills of PCEP
staff.
7.          Prolect Description.  The proposed project consists of: (a) the
installation of line loss reduction and rehabilitation equipment at the Aden
System; (b) the installation of equipment for the first phase of the Aden
System Network Control Center; (c) the installation of equipment for line loss
reduction at the Wadi Hadramawt Branch; (d) consultancy services to assist
PCEP during the preconstruction and construction phases of (a), (b) and (c)
above; and (e) consultancy services for both the in-house and overseas
training of PCEP staff (including training equipment).



8.          Actions Agreed During Neeotiations.  The major project-related
issues were the need to: (i) reduce the fuel oil prices charged to PCEP to
the international level; (ii) insulate PCEP and the Public Water Corporation
(PWC) from the adverse financial impact of the operation of desalination unit
of the Hiswa Power and Desalination Plant (HPDP); (iii) ensure that, from 1991
onwards, PCEP would achieve a break-even status, that is PCEP would generate
enough revenues from its operation to cover its total operating costs,
including depreciation on revalued assets and interest chargeable to
operations; (iv) ensure that accounts receivable from PCEP's consumers do not
exceed three months of average electricity sales (currently, accounts
receivable from the Government including public sector consumers, and from
other consumers are, respectively, about 11 and 7 months of electricity
sales); and (v) implement an action plan, satisfactory to the Association, to
ensure reduction of line losses from about 18% in 1989 to 122 in 1996 (the
project includes line reduction equinment for areas responsible for about 90X
of electricity sales and PCEP is to implement measures for reducing line
losses in the remaining areas). Prior to negotiations, effective May 1, 1990,
the Government reduced the fuel oil prices charged to PCEP, as recommended by
the Association. During negotiations, the Government agreed to insulate PCEP
and PWC from the adverse financial impact of desalination plant operations at
Hiswa. In addition, during negotiations, agreement was reached on (iii), (iv)
and (v) above. The Development Credit and Project agreements would reflect
the agreements reached during negotiations.
9.          Benefits.  Project benefits include: (i) a reduction of line
losses resulting in savings in generation and fuel consumption at the power
stations; (ii) the increased reliability of electrical supply; (iii) an
improvement in PCEP's financial performance due to a reduction in expenses and
increased sales revenues; and (iv) an improvement in the operational and
managerial skills of PCEP staff. The quantifiable economic benefits are
adequate and are reflected in an internal economic rate of return (IERR) of
about 11. A sensitivity analysis indicates that a shortfall of 15% in
electricity sales would reduce the IERR to about 7%. However, given the
conservative load forecast (para. 10) assumed for electricity sales, the
chances of such an occurrence are small. In case of a 15% increase in the
project costs or a 15Z increase in the fuel costs, the IERR remains
approximately equal to the opportunity cost of capital of 10%.
10.         Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the proposed
project. Possible risks that could have an adverse impact on the rate of
return relate to delays in project implementation. To reduce these risks the
project includes engineering consultancy services to assist PCEP in its
procurement, installation and commissioning activities. Moreover, to reduce
the possible impact of project cost overruns, the implementation schedule has
been spread over seven years, even tbough a similar project could be completed
in five years. A very conservative load forecast for electricity sales has
been assumed for the financial forecast. Therefore any impact on the rate of
return stemming from the above-mentioned risks is minimal.
11.         Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
