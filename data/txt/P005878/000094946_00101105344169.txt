PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Power Project for which an IDA
Credit (2164-YEM) of SDR 11.9 million (equivalent to US$15.5 million) to the Republic of Yemen
was approved by the Board on June 21, 1990, just a month after the official announcement of the
reunification of North and South Yemen.
The Project closed on December 31, 1999, three years after its original Closing Date, due to major
delays arising from the merger of the two power utilities, civil war and a two-year suspension of
disbursements because of non-compliance with Credit covenants. The project was restructured and
the Development Credit Agreement amended in November 1994 and again in May 1997 to reflect the
altered circumstances since the project was appraised. The Credit Closing Date was extended twice
to complete the project, which was originally designed for completion within a seven-year timeframe.
Actual Project works started only in 1996 caused by the need to rebid one of the major components
of the Project. An undisbursed balance of about SDR 0.40 million (equivalent to about US$0.53
million) was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs./Mme. Somin Mukherji (Team Leader), Sunil Mathrani
(Consultant-Energy Economist), Josephine Masanque (Financial Analyst) and Mr. Ali Khamis
(Operations Officer). The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Jean-Claude Villiard (Sector Director), Ms.
Zoubeida Ladhibi-Belk (Sector Manager), Mr. Gianni Brizzi, (Yemen Country Representative) and
Ms. Tufan Kolan (Portfolio Manager).
Preparation for the ICR began during the final supervision mission in December 1999 and was
completed in May 2000. The report is based on documents in the project files, information collected
in the field and discussions with the Borrower. An ICR was also prepared by the Borrower and a
summary is attached as Appendix B.

3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3,1 Original Objective:
3.1.1   Original Proiect Obiectives.  According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the initial
development objectives of the Project were to assist the power utility in the Peoples' Democratic Republic
of Yemen (PDRY), the Public Corporation for Electric Power (PCEP)1 in: (i) meeting the incremental
demand for electricity in the Aden region by rehabilitation of the Aden system; (ii) reducing line losses in
the Aden system and the Wadi Hadramawt branch; (iii) improving PCEP's finamcial position; and (iv)
improving the technical and managerial skills of PCEP staff.
3.1.2  These objectives were appropriate and relevant to the issues confronting the PDRY power sector in
the late 1980s when electricity demand had been increasing rapidly by 8% annually. While generation
capacity was in surplus, the Aden power transmission and distribution system was old and overloaded, with
the result that power supply was unreliable and energy losses were high (18%). Because of a shortage of
skilled manpower, PCEP's financial management was weak. Even though tariffs, exceeded the long run
marginal cost of producing power (LRMC), PCEP was in deficit. In addition, it was burdened by
high-cost of water and power produced by the combined Hiswa power and water desalination plant, an
uneconomic project that it was obliged to undertake on behalf of the government.
3.2 Revised Objective:
3.2.1  As a result of the unification of the two Yemens in 1990, PCEP of the south and Yemen General
Electric Corporation (YGEC) of the north were merged and in 1991, Public Electricity Corporation (PEC)
was legally established. The Credit was suspended in mid-1993 due to PEC's default in complying with
the agreed financial covenants. Following the civil war (mid-1994), the GOY requested IDA to lift the
suspension and restructure the Project to reconstruct the war damaged power systemn in the southern region.
The restructuring (of late- 1994) resulted in minor modification of the original Project objectives and except
for elimination of the reduction of line losses at the Wadi Hadramawt branch, all other objectives were
retained. This was aimed at making more resources available for reconstruction and reinforcement of the
badly damaged Aden power system (para. 3.4.1).
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1  As initially designed, the Project had three components that were meant to ensure that the original
project objectives were met. These were:
*  rehabilitation of the Aden system to increase its operating efficiency and meet incremental demand
through provision of additional substation, transmission and distribution capacity, capacitor banks
and a network control center;
* provision of loss reduction and distribution expansion equipment for the Wadi Hadramawt branch;
and
* technical assistance and training to improve PCEP's technical and managerial skills.
3.4 Revised Components:
3.4.1  In line with the revised Project objectives, during restructuring (November 1994) the lower priority
activities including, construction of the network control center, line loss-reduction equipment in Aden, the
entire Wadi Hadramawt component and the second phase of the training activities were dropped. The
funds thus released were reallocated to cover reconstruction and reinforcement of lines damaged during the
hostilities, and to replace equipment and spares which were damaged or looted. The construction of bulk
supply substations to increase capacity and reduce losses as originally envisaged was retained.

Assessment of Design
3.4.2  The project was designed as a traditional power system rehabilitation and expansion project and
was not unduly complex or risky. No major sector policy reform measures were included. Adequate
arrangements were made for engineering and management support to PCEP during implementation.
However, while a significant portion of the Credit (US$1.2 million) was allocated initially for training
activities, implementation of this component was not defined adequately at appraisal. Nor did the project
incorporate specific measures/action plans to improve the financial and accounting capabilities of the
utility, even though these were components of the project objectives and central to PCEP's ability to meet
the financial covenants of the DCA.
3.4.3  Satisfactory financial performance by PCEP was also predicated upon government commitments to
reduce the price of fuel oil' to PCEP and to insulate PCEP from the cost burden of operating the over-sized
investment in the water desalination plant. These proved to be undertakings that the government found
difficult to adhere to. Satisfactory resolution of the perennial problem of payment of arrears for electricity
consumed by the government and public sector bodies also depended upon government action, which
proved not to be forthcoming. With hindsight, these issues should have been addressed more thoroughly in
the project design and the risks of failure to achieve financial goals highlighted in the SAR. Instead, it
indicated that risk of not achieving the financial objectives was small, which is hard to reconcile with the
prevailing fiscal problems of the government.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1   Based on the criteria prevailing at the time of appraisal, this ICR assesses the quality at entry as
satisfactory. Although, in today's context, a review of the quality at entry indicates several shortcomings.
Using today's criteria, the Project could have agreed on: (i) clear measures that would result in the
institutional strengthening of PCEP including its accounting, commercial and financial functions; (ii)
detailed training component aimed at improving the technical and managerial skills of PCEP; and (iii)
overall up-front financial improvements supported by necessary action plans. In addition the risks to the
Project should have been adequately addressed.
Later merged with the northern utility, Yemen General Electric Corporation to form the Public Electricity Corporation (PEC).
PCEP had to pay 1.5 to 2 times the international price for fuel oil and diesel, which were heavily taxed.
At that time priced substantially above the international price.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1   The Project financed procurement of materials required for rehabilitation of the Aden transmission
and distribution system. Implementation is being carried out by PEC through its own resources and all
works are expected to be completed by the end of 2001. Upon completion, the Project will have fully
achieved its revised physical objectives. The Project financed various premises, vehicles, communications
and office equipment which replaced the war losses and brought the Aden branch of PEC to operate as a
normal power utility. The ex-post economic intemal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project has been
estimated at 14% which compares well with the 11% at appraisal.
4.1.2   However, the impact of the project on improving PEC's overall financial position (and particularly
the technical and management functions of the Aden Branch) was rather limited. On the whole, PEC
-3 -



(including its Aden Branch) remains a weak institution, with serious difficulties in. key areas such as project
management/implementation, financial management, accounts and management accounting system (paras.
4.4.2-4.4.5).
4.1.3  During the entire implementation period, there was no sustained improvement in PEC's financial
performance, which failed to break-even in all but one year (1996 ) during the past decade. The 1999
unaudited reports indicate a further erosion of PEC's equity base (net loss of about YR 4.6 billion), energy
losses at an unsatisfactory level of 27% and accounts receivables at an unacceptable level of seven months
of average monthly electricity billing. In spite of suspension of disbursement (mid-1993) due to
non-compliance with the covenant on timely submission of audit reports, PEC continued to be in default
(except for 1997) throughout the entire Project period (para. 4.4.5).
4.1.4  In view of the above, the ICR assesses the overall project outcome as unsatisfactory. Even though
the physical objectives were somewhat met, the project failed to meet the agreed financial targets on
break-even requirement, accounts receivables and debt service coverage minima. Subsequently, at the time
of 'retrofitting' in mid-1997, several covenants were deleted from the DCA5 (para. 7.2.3) and the project
development objectives as included in the Project Status Report were modified to reflect the project's
revised goal of rehabilitating Aden's war-damaged power facilities.
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1  The new bulk supply substations and switchgears (which account for 52% of the project costs),
have substantially increased the capacity (by 200%) and reliability of the sub-transmission (33/ llkV)
network; this component has been fully completed.
4.2.2  The Project also helped provide necessary support for reinforcing and extending the distribution
system at 33kV and below by financing materials and equipment that are currently being utilized directly
by PEC staff for this purpose. Various sections of 33/11 kV lines in the Aden area are being upgraded
using project-funded materials and equipment with PEC's own workforce carrying out the construction.
Currently, these works are proceeding and are expected to be completed by end-2001 as scheduled. The
67km, 132kV transmission interconnection between Abyan and Aden is also being rehabilitated and
upgraded by the addition of a second circuit; completion is expected by end-2000.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
4.3.1  The economic analysis of the project presented in the SAR estimated the EIRR on a 1990-96 time
slice of the investment program of PCEP, the southem power utility to be 11%. Measurable benefits were
taken to be the incremental sales valued at the existing tariffs, since these were above LRMC at that time.
4.3.2  For the purposes of the ICR the same time-slice methodology was used to estimate the ex-post
EIRR of the project. However, since the PCEP no longer exists, the investment program, costs and sales of
the Aden Branch of PEC were used in order to approximate the analysis in the SAR.' The time-slice used
was for the period 1995-2001, corresponding to the actual implementation period of the Project.
Incremental sales of the Aden Branch have been used as a proxy for the project benefits. These sales have
been valued at the prevailing tariffs. On this basis the recomputed IERR is 14%. Details of the
calculations and the assumptions used are included in Annex 3.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
4.4.1  The GOY, through the MEW and the MOF, regulates PEC's operations, tariff policy, investments
and budgetary allocations. PEC has little control over the amount (or use) of the revenue it generates. This
situation has proven unsustainable, however, and the GOY has begun to take effective steps to improve
PEC's financial performance to meet its commitment to the IMF under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
4.4.2  PEC's overall financial situation continues to be weak, and the tumultuous setting (after the
unification and the gulf war) against which the two utilities (PCEP and YGEC) were shaped had no impact
at all on the company's financial performance, as PEC has always been entangled in financial quandary
since it was legally established in 1993. In that year, IDA suspended credit disbursements to PEC due to
non compliance with its financial agreement on the annual submission of audit report. But because of the
civil war in 1994 and upon request of the Government to rebuild its war-damaged power systems in the
southem region and its commitment to adjust the electricity tariffs, IDA lifted the suspension in August
1995. As a result, tariffs' were increased in 1996 by more than 100 percent and PEC was able to comply
with the breakeven covenant in that year.
4.4.3. Its overall financial management and internal control mechanism has been weak and inordinate
delays in finalization of year-end trial balances resulted in delayed (except for 1997) finalization of audit
reports; thus PEC has not been in compliance with timely submission of audit reports to IDA. In addition
the audit reports were qualified over the years, partly due to PEC's inability to strengthen its overall
financial management, improve its accounting practice and develop a reliable management information
system. PEC was unable to overcome these difficulties and its overall financial management continued to
decline. However, of late, there seems to be a serious effort on PEC's part in reversing the trend by
strengthening of its financial management. Audit observations are being attended to, efforts are being made
to strengthen internal controls and necessary initiatives have been taken to improve revenue collections.
4.4.4. PEC made net losses in every year (except for 1996); as such it continues to depend heavily on
GOY budgetary support. PEC's tariff structure needs to be rationalized as it does not offer any incentive
or penalty to encourage any conservation or demand side management (DSM) initiatives. With no tariff
increases since 1998 and with the expected removal of fuel oil and debt service subsidies, PEC is not
expected to generate adequate funds to meet its operating costs during 2000.
4.4.5  PEC failed to meet the agreed financial targets. In 1998, PEC was unable to generate revenues
from operations to meet its operating costs (break-even), largely because tariff adjustments did not keep
pace with inflation, high system losses (about 29%) and lack of good commercial practices. PEC has not
recovered as it continued to accumulate losses in 1999 (based on unaudited financial statements), caused by
the gradual increase in fuel prices in 1998. The accounts receivable outstanding has never reached the
agreed target of three months, with the highest in 1994, at 14 months outstanding (during the civil war),
which showed an impressive improvement in 1997 and 1998, at its lowest of five months. But by the end
of 1999, this has started to climb to about seven months equivalent of average monthly electricity sales,
with the Government accounting for about 14 months. The agreed debt-service coverage ratio of 1.5 times
was never achieved by PEC, as it continuous to incur losses. It fell to its lowest in 1995, (minus 0.19) and
has hardly improved since and is estimated to be at minus 0.77 as of 1999 (Appendix D).
4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1. Since the major focus of the Project had shifted to emergency reconstruction, as part of the project
restructuring, the bulk of the US$1.2 million initially earmarked for training was reallocated to the
- 5 -



emergency reconstruction component. The project financed materials and equipment for the PEC training
center in Aden prior to the restructuring, as well as some technical training courses for staff. In total, the
project funded about US$0.4 million of training equipment and courses of short duration in which over 300
PEC staff participated. The Project's overall impact on PEC Aden Branch's institutional development was
less than as anticipated at appraisal and, at best, was modest.
Tariff adjustment was implemented as a condition of Project restructuring.
The Region wide retrofitting of 1997 aimed at sharpening the focus on to more relevant and achievable development
objectives. In the process, several covenants deemed less relevant and not attainable were dropped.
PEC Aden Branch covers a smaller area than PCEP, so the comparison is only approximate.
Since late 1997, the Government and PEC have acted to address the major problem areas, which inacludes increasing tariffs by
54 percent, in November 1997, and by an additional 12 percent (YR/kWh) in July 1998, bringing the tariff to YR 8.52/kWh in
1999.
This consistent with IMF commitment to increase the fuel price to the level of the international price (see footnote 3).
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency.
5.1.1   Several significant external factors outside the control of the government or the implementing
agency affected project implementation.
Unification of North and South Yemen
5.1.2   Project implementation during 1991-92 was seriously delayed due to priority being given to the
integration of the two countries, which also involved the merger of the two power utilities. The Yemeni
Dinar that was used in the former PDRY was phased out and the official fixed exchange rate of the Riyal
to the Dollar was abolished in 1995 and replaced by a free-market rate. Also, the Yemeni Riyal
depreciated more than ten-fold between 1994 and 19969. These significant fiscal changes had a major
negative impact on PEC's finances and on the level of tariff increase requirements.
Civil War
5.1.3 The mid-1994 civil war resulted in heavy damage to the Aden power supply system. However,
there was no damage caused to any physical component of the Project, as implementation was stalled due
to Credit suspension prevailing at that time. Subsequently, after hostilities ceased, a review of the
components was carried out and restructuring initiated.
Credit suspension
5.1.4   The two-year suspension of the Credit for non-compliance with financial covenants from mid-1993
to mid-1995 was a major contributory factor in the delay in completing the project on time.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project was also adversely affected by the following:
*   High inflation during the 1990-96 period (in excess of 25%  annually), combined with GOY's
general reluctance to raise tariffs meant that they fell significantly in real terms. In the decade 1990
- 2000 the level of prices in Yemen increased 20-fold while power tariffs only increased eight-fold;
- 6 -



*   GOY failed to compensate PEC for losses incurred in operating the Hiswa desalination plant, to
make adequate budgetary provision for the electricity consumnption of government agencies and to
organize a cross settlement of arrears among various state bodies, thus contributing to further
weakening of PEC's overall financial situation;
*   GOY could not always make adequate or timely arrangements for releasing counterpart funds to
PEC in order to pay local contractors, which contributed to implementation delays.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
*   PEC did not wish to award the contract for the 33/1 1kV substations to the lowest evaluated bidder
due to its non-compliance with 'prior experience' criteria, a factor not included in the initial
bidding documents. After lengthy verbal and written exchanges over a six-month period between
IDA and PEC it was decided to rebid for the substations, which resulted in an additional two-year
delay in implementing this component.
*   PEC was consistently unable to finalize its accounts within the agreed period, and thus was always
in violation of the requirement to submit its audited accounts to IDA on time. This was a
contributory factor in the decision to suspend disbursements.
*   PEC's project monitoring and administration was weak. At the time of Credit Closing there was a
significant undisbursed balance (about US$1.0 million), while several contractors did not receive
full payment for goods and services provided under the project; this was mainly due to PEC's
inefficiency in submitting withdrawal applications in a timely manner.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1. Total project cost including contingencies, at appraisal was at US$20.93 million equivalent; this
included a foreign exchange component of US$15.50 million (about 74%). During restructuring, the
project cost was estimated to reach US$20.67 million equivalent. By the Closing Date, actual cost is
estimated at US$18.94 million, which is expected to increase to about US$20.7 million upon completion of
the remaining works during 2000 - 2001.
5.4.2. At the time of Credit Closing, total project financing by IDA was US$15.48 million; this was close
to the SAR estimates of US$15.50 million . Counterpart funding was to be provided by the Government
for the balance. Funding by GOY at the time of ICR preparation was US$3.46 million which was about
64% of the appraisal estimates for US$5.40 million. However, based on the Borrower's estimates, this is
expected to rise to US$5.22 million which is close to the appraisal estimate and would be about 25% of
final project costs upon full completion of the project.
The fixed rate prior to the liberalization of the foreign exchange market in early 1995 was $1 = YR 12. By end 1996 the rate
had dropped to $1 = YR 127.
This was based on an exchange rate of ISDR = US$1.30 at appraisal, as against an average rate of ISDR= US$1.39 for
disbursements during the life of the project. As a result of appreciation of the SDR against the dollar, PEC had 6% more US
Dollar resources at its disposal than anticipated, which is one of the reasons for the significant undisbursed balance at the time
of project closing.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
6.1.1  The sustainability of the physical investments financed under the project is assessed as likely since
they form an integrated part of the PEC Aden Branch transmission and distribution system. As such, they
will be operated and maintained according to standard power utility practices.
6.1.2  However, PEC as an entity has yet to achieve financial viability. It has not made profit since it
was created in 1991 and its predecessor utilities were also chronically loss-making entities. Prospects for
its future financial sustainability are uncertain, given continuing non-compliance with the financial
covenants of the follow-on Sana'a Emergency Power Project (SEPP - Cr.3 1 32-YEM).
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1  Close monitoring of the project by IDA during the next 18 months is reconunended in order to
ensure the satisfactory completion of the rehabilitation of the Aden-Abiyan transmission line as well as the
Aden LV distribution system. This is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the project as a whole and
should be given due consideration in IDA's ongoing/future involvement in the sector.
6.2.2  PEC's overall financial and operational performance is being monitored under the ongoing SEPP
which commits PEC to reducing its accounts receivables to 90 days, achieve financial breakeven without
subsidies on fuel inputs in the near term, make a rising contribution to its investment program from
internally-generated funds and reduce its energy losses to 18% by 2001.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Identification. preparation and aWpraisal
7.1.1  The project's objectives were appropriate. Preparation and appraisal were satisfactory from a
technical standpoint and took about 18 months to complete.  However, there were a number of
shortcomings in project design (paras. 3.4.2-3.4.3) and in the financial aspects of appraisal (para. 3.5.1).
No environmental impact assessment was carried out, given that the project only entailed
rehabilitation/construction of substations, transmission and distribution lines, which have minor
environmental impacts.
7.1.2  A six-month delay occurred after the Bank had issued the green cover SAR because of difficulties
in getting the government to meet the conditions for negotiations. The latter was in part due to the Bank's
requirement that GOY compensate PCEP for the high costs of producing water from the Hiswa
desalination plant. In addition, during the first half of 1990, PDRY government efforts were focussed on
reunification talks with the YAR. Credit negotiations finally occurred just days before the formal
announcement of reunification of the two Yemens in May 1990. These delayed the Board presentation,
which took place a year after appraisal. Subsequently, because of the merger of the two utilities (PCEP
and YGEC) and delays in legalizing the merged utility (PEC), Credit effectiveness was also delayed and
took a further 14 months to accomplish.
-8 -



7.1.3  With hindsight, it appears that there may have been a case for a reappraisal of the project, given
the strong probability of a merger between the two utilities' and the concomitant difficulties in harmnonizing
the differences in tariffs prevailing in the two utilities of the north and south Yemen. This would also have
assisted in implicating the new government in the project, and in building ownership for it, given that the
project was entirely located in the former PDRY and unfamiliar to many decision-makers of the former
YAR. However, given the fact that the Credit had already been negotiated and the end of the fiscal year
was imminent, it was perhaps a pragmatic decision to proceed with Board presentation without a
reappraisal.
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1   Overall project supervision by IDA was satisfactory, with fifteen missions in the eight years
between effectiveness and closure. Given the various interruptions experienced during the implementation
phase including the unification of 1990, gulf war of 1991, Credit suspension in 1993 and the civil war of
1994, the bulk of IDA's supervision activity was concentrated during the last four years. In reality this
was the actual project implementation period, given that very little had been accomplished prior to lifting of
Credit suspension (mid-1995). The suspension itself was handled well, with firmness on the IDA's part
combined with ample early warnings given to the Borrower, including a 60-day informal suspension notice
prior to the formal declaration.
7.2.2 In 1994, following the civil war, IDA responded promptly to GOY's request to restructure the
project and this correctly reallocated part of the Credit amount on the immediate reconstruction and
rehabilitation needs of the war-damaged Aden system. However, the restructuring was somewhat hybrid in
nature. Although, the restructured Project was described as 'basically an emergency operation'," IDA did
not explicitly convert the project to an emergency relief assistance activity without specific performance
covenants, as could have been expected for a purely emergency project. This was due to the fact that the
largest project component (i.e. substations) could not be considered as emergency reconstruction. Hence,
IDA was unwilling to compromise on the need for ensuring PEC's financial viability, and insisted that
tariffs be raised at least enough to ensure that financial break-even was achieved with in 18-24 months.
This requirement contributed to a further year's delay in lifting the suspension of disbursements."
7.2.3  It is worth mentioning that during the retrofitting of 1997, IDA agreed to drop the three covenants
relating to the Hiswa desalination plant which GOY had failed to comply with since the start of the Project.
This was a pragmatic recognition of the impossibility of achieving compliance, given GOY's financial
constraints, but the issue of the financial drain on PEC of continuing to operate the desalination plant
remains and is being addressed under the ongoing SEPP. Currently, PEC is investigating the prospect of
converting the surplus desalinated water into potable water for sale in the local market. The preference is
for seeking a joint venture operation with the private sector and several offers received are under
consideration.
7.2.4 The project also benefited from a fairly high degree of continuity in Bank staff who worked on the
project and from the decision in the later years, to transfer responsibility for task management to the
Country Office.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
7.3.1 Taking into account all of the above, the Bank's overall performance is assessed to have been
satisfactory.
-9-



Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1   The Borrower's performance was satisfactory as regards to project identification, preparation and
appraisal. It participated fully in discussions concerning project component identification.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1   GOY's performance was unsatisfactory because: (i) tariff increases were consistently delayed and
insufficient to prevent the level of tariffs from halving in real terms, (ii) it did not observe its undertakings
to compensate PEC for losses incurred in running the Hiswa desalination plant, (iii) it did not provide PEC
with the necessary counterpart funds in a timely manner, (iv) it failed to make adequate budgetary
allocations for the electricity consumption of state bodies, and (v) the excessively long time taken to issue
the Presidential Decree formalizing the merger of the two utilities delayed the project by almost a year at a
time when urgent repairs were needed.
7.6 Implementing Agency.
7.6.1   Despite the establishment of an autonomous Project Implementation Unit (PIU), PEC's overall
performance in physical implementation of the project was not filly satisfactory. Procurement issues were
often contentious and the PIU did not manage the process with sufficient diligence. Payments were not
handled expeditiously and monitoring was patchy. The large undisbursed balance (of about US$1.0
mnillion) that was subsequently canceled resulted from a lack of close monitoring of implementation
progress by the PIU and a failure to submit withdrawal applications promptly as the deadline for final
disbursements approached. Furthermore, PEC failed to produce its accounts in a timely manner, its overall
financial management was weak and it failed to improve its revenue collection during the project period.
Finally, on the institutional side, it suffered from the failure to appoint a Finance Director between 1997-98
and from rapid staff turnover.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.7.1   The performance of the Borrower is assessed as unsatisfactory.
"Furthermore, environmental impact assessments were not mandatory at the time of project appraisal.
1This was announced in late 1991, just a few months after the Credit was declared effective.
From a letter to the Managing Director of PEC signed by the Chief of the Industry & Energy Division, CD II, MENA, 30
November, 1994.
"This was to give GOY a transition period to phase in the large increases and was a dilution of the original break-even
covenant, which had not   been met since the start of the project.
Issuing the Presidential decree legalizing the merger of the two utilities to form PEC was equally problematic.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1.1   The key lessons that can be drawn from this project are:
*   In order to avoid disagreements over contract awards (and possible further delays arising from
rebidding), it is vital to ensure precise drafting of evaluation criteria in bidding documents; also, for
large contracts the process of prequalification should be mandatory;
- 10 -



* Major changes in the political, fiscal and institutional environment, are a strong justification for
restructuring a project; the opportunity presented by a formal project restructuring should be
utilized to take a fresh look at the appropriateness of the initial project objectives;
*   Implementation of all works that are related to fulfilling the development objectives of the Project
should be completed prior to Credit Closing. Procuring materials for such works and leaving it for
the implementing agency to implement after Credit Closure should be avoided as monitoring of
physical progress is difficult. The usual delays in completion result in delays in achieving the
overall development objectives;
* Improving the financial performance of a power utility largely depends upon improving revenue
earnings which requires an upfront action (during project preparation) on areas including tariff
adjustments, loss reduction, improved billing and enhanced revenue collection measures. Agreed
loan covenants need to be supported by appropriate action plans to attain the desired level of
financial performance. Institutional strengthening, via improvements in financial, accounting and
management systems, increases the sustainability of projects; and
*   Close supervision by field staff and a flexible response to changing conditions can improve the
implementation of a project that faces serious implementation problems.

Notes:
-   All data applies to PEC's Aden branch only.
-   The period of analysis is 25 years, 1995-2020.
*   All Aden branch investments have been included, even though some of these contribute to supplying areas outside the
Aden branch via the nterconnected grid.
*   Operations and maintenance costs have been taken to be 2% of the cumulative capital investment.
*   1998 average Aden Branch fuel costs of 3.75 YRlkWh have been assumed constant throughout.
Itncremental sales have been assumed to be attributable to the project only from year 4 of the project, given the 7-year
implementation period. Sales are projected to grow by 5% annually from 2000 to 2004 and are held constant thereafter.
This is a conservative estimate, given the ongoing boom in construction and property development that Aden is now
experiencing. It is only slightly above the 1995-2000 rate (4.5% annually), when the Aden power system was suffering
the aftermath of the civil war.
*   No estimate of benefits from reduced technical losses has been included, even though the project investments will assist in
cutting such losses.
*   Sales have been valued at existing 1998 tariffs (average revenue: 8.3 YR/kWh), which are assumed to remain constant.
This understates project benefits. If the tariff necessary to meet the financial covenant in the SEP project (10.8 YR/kWh)
is used to value benefits from 2001 onwards, the IRR rises to 18%.

THIRD POWER PROJECT (Cr. 2164-YEM)
COMPLETION SUPERVISION MISSION
November 20-December 5, 1999
Introduction
1.    An IDA mission comprising Messrs./Mme. Somin Mukherji, Josephine Masanque and Ali Khamis
carried out the final supervision of the above project during the period November 20 through December 5,
1999. The mission wishes to thank the officials and staff of the Ministry of Planning and Development
(MOPD), Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW), the Public Electricity Corporation (PEC) and the
Aden Branch of PEC for all the courtesies, assistance and hospitality extended to the mission members.
2.     This aide memoire summarizes the mission's findings and recommendations, which are subject to
review and confirmation by IDA management. A list of people met during the mission is included in Annex
1.
Background
3.     An IDA Credit for SDR 11.9 million (US$15.5 million equivalent) was made effective on February
6, 1991. The main objectives of the project are to assist PEC meet the incremental demand for electricity in
the Aden region by rehabilitation of the Aden power system, reduce line losses, strengthen PEC's technical
and financial position and help PEC improve the technical and managerial skills of its staff.
Implementation of the project suffered major setbacks as consequences arising from the Gulf war, the 1990
unification of North and South Yemen, Credit suspension (because of delays in the submission of audit
reports) between 1993-1995, and the civil war of 1994. The project was formally restructured in 1994 and
retrofitted in 1997. Over the years, the project scope and the various components have gone through
significant changes. The changes in project scope are detailed out in Annex-2. Currently, the project
scope consists of: (i) rehabilitation of five sub-stations, (ii) rehabilitation of 67km of 132-kV transmission
line (Aden-Abian), (iii) provision of conductors and accessories, cables, and distribution transformers of
various capacities. The project also provides for technical assistance to strengthen PEC's technical and
managerial skills. 4.   Closing Date: The Credit Closing Date was extended twice, and GOY's request
for a final extension until December 31, 1999, was approved on November 16, 1998. Extension of the
Credit Closing Date was allowed primarily to enable PEC rehabilitate the sub-stations (Contract No. 1)
which accounts for about 60% of the total project cost
Implementation of Physical Works
5.    During field visits to all the project sites, the implementation progress of the various project
components were reviewed. The procurement status as of November 30, 1999, is included in Annex 3.
Current status of implementation of physical works is as follows
6.     Rehabilitation of five sub-stations: Since the last supervision mission of June 1999, the progress of
works under this component (Contract No. 1) has improved considerably and almost complete. The overall
completion of physical works is at about 99% in comparison to 50% as of December 1998 and 90% as of
June 1999. Of the five sub-stations, the ones at Shenaz and Block 80 were formally inaugurated (on
- 23 -



September 12, 1999) by the President of the Republic. Most of the commissioning tests at all the
sub-stations have been completed except for those which have to be done at the time of energization. The
specific status of implementation of works at the various sites is as follows: (a) B3lock 80 - both the
transformers are energized and are supplying electricity to the system, (b) Shenaz and Al-Manara: Due to
contractual problem with PEC's cable trenching contractor, the laying of the 33-kV cable circuits between
Shenaz and Al Manara was delayed slightly; this is now expected to be completed by December 15, 1999
and energization to be effected by December 31, 1999, (c) Medinat Ashaab:  Transferring of cables to
Medinat Asha'ab is in progress and expected to be completed by December 20, 1999, energization of this
sub-station is expected by December 31, 1999, and (d) Lahei: The implementation status of the civil and
electrical works is at 95% and 98% respectively. These are expected to be comp.leted by the end of
December 1999 and energization to be effected by mid-January 2000.
7.     Rehabilitation of 67km  of 132-kV transmission lines (Aden-Abian):   Materials for this
rehabilitation work is to be financed out of the Credit and the labor contract is to be financed out of PEC's
own budgetary resources. Materials for this rehab-work are covered under Contract numbers 15-21 (refer
Annex-3) and all materials have arrived. However, because of pilferage/theft some materials delivered
under Contract no -18 (costing about USD15,000) are needed urgently in order to complete the
rehabilitation works of the above transmission line. These however can not be delivered before the Credit
Closing Date. During mission, PEC explained the urgency of these materials and requested IDA's special
consideration to facilitate procurement of them. Since, disbursement from Credit can only be made for
materials supplied on or before the Credit Closing date, the issue will be conveyed to IDA management and
subiect to the availability of funds (para. 10). the matter will be given due consideration at the time of
Credit closure.
8.     Rehabilitation of LV Network system: Materials for these rehabilitation worls are to be financed
out of the Credit and cost of implementation to be financed out of PEC's own budgetary resources.
Procurement of all materials related to the rehabilitation of the network systems for 33 -kV, 11 -kV and
below, are completed through Contracts 1-13 All materials have arrived and the network rehabilitation
work is progressing satisfactorily. As per current progress of implementation all rehabilitation works
(33-kV, I l-kV and below) is expected to be completed by 2001. A bar chart on implementation of the
network system is included in Annex-4.
9.     Storage facility at Beir Fhadhal: A 20m x 40m PEC storage facility was included within the scope
of Contract No -1 with RMT (the sub-stations contractor) at a total cost of US$288,297 and YER
1,722,481. Subsequently, the size of the stores was modified to 20m x 60m and the total cost of the
enlarged facility including additional site work and a 7.5T O/H crane with associated structural
strengthening is US$485,430 and YER 1,310,872 (this includes some price reductions as well because of
deletions in the price of boundary fencing). The current status of implementation is at 80% of completion,
and the facility is expected to be completed by the end of December 1999. During mission, the variation
order related to the stores was discussed/reviewed and subject to a satisfactory outcome of the review
process and the availability of funds (para 10) the mission will provide necessary approval for PEC to
proceed. The mission however reminded PEC that in case the works are not completed by the end of
December 1999, the Credit will finance works completed as of December 31, 1999, and any works carried
out beyond the Credit Closing date will have to be financed out of PEC's own resources.
10.    Availability of additional funds: PEC's latest cost estimates indicate a possible saving from actual
contract expenditures to be about US$770,000 (Annex -5). Much of these will be utilized for fornalizing
the financing of several items that PEC has already procured against variation orders through their
sub-stations contractor RMT. These are being reviewed now and necessary clearances will be accorded on
- 24 -



a case by case basis. In addition, there is an issue of procuring two items (viz. a 5MVA transformer and
various fittings for the 132-kV transmission line rehabilitation works) that are expected to arrive three
months after Credit closure.  Subject to availability of funds, the mission will recommend to IDA
management that neceSsarY approval be given to PEC so that procurement of these items be allowed on an
exceptional basis after Credit closure.
Technical Assistance and Training
11.   During the implementation of the Project, various training activities have taken place both
in-country and abroad. These included factory training for PEC engineers in specialized areas on operation
and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, management and procurement. Overseas
training was organized in areas of operations and maintenance of protection relays, energy meters, medium
voltage switchgear, power transformers, and high voltage insulators . In total 310 PEC staff have been
trained under this Project, details of these are included in Annex-6.
Accounts and Finance
12.   Organizational Set-up:  The current organizational set-up and practices have undermined any
efforts on the part of PEC's management to initiate any change and, as explained later, the overall financial
condition of PEC continues to deteriorate. Necessary support from the GOY/MEW is therefore needed
urgently to ensure that the management of PEC is able to play its role independently and effectively; this is
essential to improve the overall financial condition of the corporation. The ongoing institutional and
organizational study (I/O study) under the Sana'a Emergency Power Project (SEPP), is expected to bring
about effective improvement in accounting and financial systems in PEC; completion of the study is now
scheduled for end-December 2000.
Audit Reports:
13.   PEC's financial statements: Based on recommendations agreed during the June1999 supervision
mission, PEC focused on improving three main issues highlighted in the FY97 audit report. PEC has
taken the initial steps to establish an accurate record of all PEC outstanding loans and to maintain proper
asset register, both of these are expected to be completed by March 2000. The collection of accounts
receivables has also improved.
14.   The audit work for the period FYs97-99 has been contracted out to a private audit firm. As in the
past, PEC continues to default on timely submission of audit reports. The FY97 audit reports were
submitted in May 1999, i.e., after a delay of 11 months. The FY98 audit report (due by June 1999) is now
over due by about six months and is currently under review by PEC; finalization of the report is expected
by January 30, 2000. Soon thereafter, the audit work for FY99 will start and it is expected that it will be
finalized and submitted by June 30, 2000 as scheduled. During mission PEC agreed to this schedule.
15.   Audit of SOEs and SA: Audit report on expenses made through SOEs and SAs are required to be
submitted six months after the end of each fiscal year.  Audit reports for FY97 were submitted in May
1999. Audit reports of FY98 are ready and pending finalization of contract with the auditor, these are now
expected by December 30, 1999. Audit reports for FY99 will be made available by June 30, 2000 as
scheduled. During mission. PEC agreed to this schedule.
16.   Financial Covenants: For FYs 98 and 99, the agreements with IDA requires PEC to break even
(revenues sufficient to meet operating costs). PEC is not expected to meet its break even covenant for
- 25 -



FY98. During FY99, PEC's income statement for the first nine months indicates that its revenues will not
be sufficient to meet its operating costs. During this year, while tariffs remained thle same, salaries were
increased by 20% and fuel costs by about 18% (from YR1 lAiter to YR13/liter). It is therefore unlikely
that during FY99, PEC will be in compliance with the financial covenant (break-even).
17.   Debt-Service Coverage (DSCQ: The agreements with IDA also call for PEC to achieve a DSC
ratio of 1.5 times. In FY98, GOY's settlement of PEC's foreign debt obligation were recorded as equity
contribution. This practice has been discouraged by IMF, as it drains the Govermment's budget. In
addition, the terms and conditions of repayment of these debts are not in agreement with subsidiary loan
agreements (SLAs) between GOY and PEC, which is a generic problem for all Government's loans on-lend
to Government-owned entities, e.g. NWSA and PEC. As anticipated in the June 1999 aide-memoire, the
trend is continuing, and based on unaudited financial statements, the DSC for FY98 and FY99 are
estimated at 4.25 time and 0.19 times respectively. PEC incurred losses due to increased operating
costs, particularly salaries and fuel bills combined with no tariff increase in FY99.
18.   PEC has succeeded in reconciling its loan accounts with Ministry of Finance and Central Bank,
except for the Italian loan. PEC's record indicates that the loan (currently at US$14 million) from the
Italian Governrment and Ansaldo (SACE) is about US$11 million more than that of the books of MOF.
PEC has requested the MOF to provide them with proper instruction or documentation to enable them to
reconcile their Italian loan accounts with that of MOF. At the Paris Club Meeting, Ansaldo (SACE)
reduced the loan by about US$11 million. The mission recommended PEC to involve the MEW in
resolving the issue with MOF.
19.   Accounts Receivable  Under the Credit Agreement, PEC is required to maintain its level of
accounts receivable at four months for FYs 98, 99 and three months thereafter. Although the level of
accounts receivable from electricity sales has improved from ten months as of the end of FY97 to about six
months as of the end of FY98, PEC continues to be in default of this covenant. This modest improvement
is the result of the off-settings of accounts among various government agencies as agreed based on IMF
recommendation (Structural Adjustment Credit), and PEC's disconnection policies. PEC also added
incentives to its workforce to improve collection.  It continues to publish the namnes of prominent
Government servants who default in settling their electricity bills in a timely manner. In addition, the MOF
has implemented direct payment from its budget allocation to various government agencies' account into
PEC account for the electricity consumption. Based on these initiatives, PEC is expected to meet the three
months level of outstanding accounts receivable by the end of FY2000. PEC will continue it's A/R
monitoring program and include this in their monthly progress report to IDA starting February 1. 2000.
20.   Electricity Tariffs: The increase in tariff in FY97 and FY98 caused PEC to lose the industrial
consumers, who are charged prices above the cost of supply. Most of these consumers shifted to using
diesel-generators, which is cheaper than electricity. In the recently completed IDA-financed Tarim Water
Supply Project, power connections to the wellfield were completed by PEC at a total cost of US$168,000
(financed by the Credit). Because of the high cost of power supply from PEC, the Tarim Branch has now
decided to use their own diesel generation instead of buying power from the PEC grid. Such shifting of
consumer behaviour has contributed to the decrease in FY98 and FY99 revenues of PEC. The proposed
tariff study under the I/O study would provide recommendations on the tariff structure and levels, as well
as a program for establishing a basis of pricing for financial viability, economic efficiency, and social
objectives.
21.     Disbursement: As of December 9,1999, a total of US$13.92 million equivalent has been
disbursed. The balance amount is expected to be disbursed before the Credit Closing Date. A table
- 26 -



showing a comparison of actual/forecast disbursement with the appraisal projections is included in Annex-
8
22.    Special Account: The Project Management Unit has a balance of US$76,382.72 in its Special
Account as of December 9, 1999.
23.   Covenant Compliance: Compliance with covenants is included in Annex-9.
Operational Plan
24.    The mission discussed and agreed with PEC on an Operational Plan (Annex-10) for the operation
phase of the Project. Since the transmission and distribution works constructed under the project will be
integrated within PEC's overall system, their operation will be subject to normal operation and maintenance
work of PEC. Further, since the Project completion goes beyond the Credit Closing date, the Operation
Plan incorporates the completion dates of the various components and provides indicators for monitoring
the Project's operation and its development impacts. Subsequent IDA missions will monitor these
indicators.
Implementation Completion Report
25.   In accord with IDA guidelines, after completion of each project, an Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) is required within six months of Project Closure. The mission discussed with PEC the
necessary information required to prepare IDA's part of the ICR and provided to PEC with necessary
advice and support for preparation of the Borrower's contribution to the ICR which will be made available
by the end of February 2000.

Appendix B
PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.    The project concept was developed in 1987, when the Aden electrical system was old and needed to
be rehabilitated in order to enhance the system's reliability and adequacy of supply. Accordingly, a study
was prepared by the World Bank Mission in May 1990. According to the staff appraisal report, originally
the components of the Third Power Project consisted of:
Aden System Rehabilitation: comprising rehabilitation of the substations, transmission and distribution
system establishment of network control center and installation of line loss reduction equipment.
Wadi Hadramout Branch: comprising installation of 33kV / 11 kV, 5 MVA substation and line loss
reduction equipment.
Technical Assistance: comprising of provision of training and engineering consultancy services and
procurement of training equipments.
2.    IDA, then discussed with Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) and Public Electricity
Corporation (PEC) the urgently needed replacement and/or rehabilitation of the materials and equipment
damaged as a result of civil disturbances (May-Julyl994), based on these discussions, it was agreed to
delete from the project, the following components / sub components:
(1) Aden system rehabilitation: network control center, line loss reduction equipments and Tawahi
substation (including change - over from 6.6kV to l1kV. Of the distribution system fed from
Tawahi substation.
(2) Wadi Hadramout branch and
(3) Technical assistance - training component.
3.    The funds so released were reallocated to cover the urgent needs, at that time, of the rehabilitation
of the equipments in the substation, replacement of transmission and distribution lines material equipments,
and essential spares damaged or lost during the civil disturbance.
The credit suspension was lifted only at May1995. Due to all factors mentioned above, the credits extended
two times: at first extended up to end of 1997 and secondly extended up to the end of 1999.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The objectives of the World Bank financed Third Power Project are to improve the quality,
reliability and availability of electric power in Aden. In particular, the following work were identified:
*  Meeting the incremental demand for electricity in the Aden region.
*  Augmentation of the capacity of 33/1 1kV substations;
*  Reinforcement of the distribution circuits which consist of 33kV and lkV cables and overhead
lines;
*  Replacement of old switchgear with higher capacity switchgear at a number of substations in order
to improve reliability;
*  Improvement of the power factor of the system in order to reduce the line losses which have become
a serious problem; in Aden and Wadi Hadramout Branches
- 29 -



* The first phase of the network Control Center including SCADA/ EMS hardware and software.
* Improving PEC financial Position.
* Improving PEC technical and Managerial skills
5.     However, as a result of the civil war in Yemen from May to July of 1994, the project was
restructured in September 1994, The loss reduction component and the network Control Center component
were omitted. Other components aimed at replacing and repairing lost or damaged equipments during the
war were added. These new components were mainly associated with the design, supply, erection and
commissioning of five (5) 33/1 1kV substations, supply of equipments for the (33kV, I 1kV and low voltage
networks and for the rehabilitation of the 132kV transmission line between Aden and Abyan (67km.).
3. PROJECT COMPONENTS

performance and for better management of PEC network assets.
5. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
5.1    Project Approval. Following approval of the project by the World Bank, credit negotiations were
held between the Bank, the Government of Republic of Yemen and relevant Ministries and agencies,The
Development Credit Agreement, to finance the Third Power Project, was concluded between the
International Development Association and the Republic of Yemen on June 21,1990.
Project Implementation and Managaement
5.2    Proiect Organization. The project was implemented in accordance with the World Bank Project
Implementation Plan PEC's Project Manager; with the close co-ordination of the Consultant SMEC
International Ltd. Was responsible for implementing the project. SMEC International Pty. Ltd. Was
retained to provide consultancy services for Project. The consultancy team assisted PEC in specification
preparation, bid evaluation, on-site construction supervision, monitoring progress of construction works,
reporting and the provision of training as required.
5.3    Procurement. All contracts financed by the IDA Credit for works and goods were awarded,
following International Competitive Bidding (ICB), according to World Bank IDA procurement guidelines.
5.4    Construction/Erection Contract No.56702/1. The design, supply, erection and commissioning of
five (5) substations and associated works were carried out on turnkey contract basis. The successful
contractor for this work was RMT Industrie - Und Elektrotechnik GmbH of Germnany at Contract price of
DM 11,454,959.00 plus US$ 1,972,170.00 plus YR 15,681,126.95.
5.5    SUpply Contracts - Contracts 56702/2 - 56702/21.  The Contractor details for the supply
contracts are shown Appendices 1 and 2 for costs estimates and Contract status of these Contracts.
5.6    Project Schedule and Progress Reporting. Procedures for monitoring the physical works and
- 31 -



financial reports were agreed with PEC, including monthly progress reports to PEC and quarterly progress
reports to the World Bank. These procedures were part of the project Implementation plan. The project
schedule for Contract 56702/1 is shown in the Microsoft Project Chart in Appendix 4.
6. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
6.1    Operations and Maintenance of the Works. The works and services that are to be completed and
commissioned under this project form an integrated part of the PEC transmission and distribution system.
The existing PEC organization will be responsible for operations and maintenance of these works.The
project components will be operated and maintained in with the established practices of the PEC. The
maintenance work is planned using schedules of tasks, frequencies, standard gang compositions and work
standards. Maintenance procedures are long established and function satisfactorily. PEC has a similar
professional to equipments operation, and uses clearly defined procedures to ensure that equipments are
operated in a safe and reliable manner.The details of all plants and equipments are taken over under the
project will be entered in to the plants and equipments register. Progress of maintenance works and
operations are to be carefully recorded and maintained; there is an established reporting system to furnish
management information reports and which important has to be made.
6.2    Education and Trainin . PEC's Third power project staff participated actively in all stages of the
project to develop PEC's institutional capability for the engineering supervision and management of T&D
project. Four overseas training programs were organized for PEC Engineers; Two (2) Engineers were sent
to Alstom, UK to join a course in power system protection analysis & applications; Six (6) Engineers
participated in a training program organized by RMT with equipments manufacturer's works such France
Transfo and Merlin Gerin. Three (3) engineers participated in a training program organized by L&G,
switzerland with energy meters applications and Two (2) engineers participated in a training program
organized by dielve, Italy with 132kV. Glass insulators applications. RMT also provided training on site
for the PEC's technical staff on equipments erection, wiring and cabling, testing, commissioning and
equipments operations. Various PEC's personnel were assigned to the contractor's staff to obtain hands-on
11kV. Circuit breakers maintenance, protection relays commissioning and settings, switchgear erection,
alignment and testing, maintenance of electronic equipments (eg. Battery chargers ... etc.).
6.3    Along the course of the project, PEC staff worked closely with the Engineer (SMEC) on a daily
basis. This provided the opportunity for training in:
*  Substations earthworks, piling, foundations, drainage, cable trenches, control buildings.
*  Substation layout, electrical details and electrical plants installation, control cabling, power
cables terminations, phasing.
*  Contract supervision and project management.
*  Construction of new substation buildings, substations refurbishment.
*  Substations testing and commissioning procedures.
*  Usage of Scott and Scott Distribution System Management software and computer hardware.
*  Installation and maintenance of radio communication equipments.
6.4    The various training programs provided to PEC staff under the Project have significantly enhanced
PEC's capacity to undertake equipments upgrade project. They have also instilled an awareness of the
benefit of improving the quality and reliability of supply to Aden, and should improve the overall
management of the utility.

6.5    Maintenance and Spares. The maintenance and care of the project facilities and installations will
be the on-going responsibility of PEC Adequate quantities of spares for maintenance had been supplied
under the project, as have suitable facilities for their storage.
7. EVALUATION OF BANK'S PERFORMANCE
7.1    PEC is thankful for the credit facilities provided by the Bank and it's strict control over
disbursements (See Appendix 3). The Borrower experienced very strict supervision and adhered to the rules
of the Bank in procurement. Any way, The establishment of the Bank's mission in Yemen in 1995. Has
greatly improved IDA's contribution towards the success of the project through shortening time needed
seeking IDA's "no objection" ........ etc. for various project activities during implementation.
8.  EVALUATION OF BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
8.1.   The project was nearly at a halt for several years (1991-1995). The transitional period after
unification of Yemen and transfer of staff from PCEP-Aden to PEC-Sana'a or MEW resulted in suspension
of the project activities. Actually, World Bank suspended the credit up to May 1995. In addition to this,
for contract 56702/1, World Bank had been advised PEC to invite those 17 bidders already participated in
round one for the second round.
8.2    Due to non-compliance of the bidders. Contract 56702/1 for the second round opened in
15.01.1997 and signed on 3.05.1997.
8.3. In general, since May 1995, the project execution was very satisfactory in all means of
implementation.
9.    ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
9.1    The project has provided PEC with an improved infrastructure and enhanced capacity to manage it.
It is suggested that performance indicators, such as 200% additional increase in substations capacity,
laying-out and energizing a lot of numbers of 33kV, 11 kV. And low voltage lines in Aden network causes
reduction in technical power losses in the network, reduction in variation of voltage between peak and
off-times and reduction of system outages per month are established. By monitoring over a period of three
years, the performance of the project can be assessed, and ongoing effectiveness of the training provided
can be estimated.
10.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
10.1   The lessons to be learned form the project is that for future projects, it will be beneficial that all
related construction work to be given to a single contractor, who will then be responsible for completion of
the project on time as scheduled and to avoid interfacing problems.
10.2   Also, on materials and equipment, supply of some Contracts, which were divided in to more than
20 packages, there were a shortage/missing items which always and in all cases deducted from the original
contract price. Successful in meeting its primary objective of increasing the quantity and improving the

quality of the Power supply services in Tarim and near by villages.
10.3     The NWSA Wadi Hadramout branch has taken over the responsibility of operating the new
Power supply system in Tarim, and a sub branch has been established. The Branch has computerized its
accounts, replaced all non working meters, installed new meters on all the non metered connections, and has
trained its staff on financial and management aspects.
Plans for Future Operations and Sustainability:
10.4   NWSA Wadi Hadramout Branch has already been operational for more than 10 years now; and
has gained experience in operating Power supply systems in Seiyun, Shibam, and Al-Qatn districts. The
branch has taken over the responsibility of operating and maintaining the Third Power system and adopted
an organization and administrative structure similar to that applied for Shibam and Al-Qatn. NWSA has
already made available the required staff and the technical and financial resources needed for its operations
in Tarim. Most of the staff needed are taken from the Tarim National Power Company, which ceased its
operations in Tarim.
10.5  It is likely that the Project will sustain the achievements generated in relation to its primary
objective and continue to supply adequate good quality Power to Tarim town and near by villages.
