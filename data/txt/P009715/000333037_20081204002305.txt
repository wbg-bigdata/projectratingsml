                This is a project completion report (PCR) f o r the Periyar Vaigai
I r r i g a t i o n Project i n India f o r which a c r e d i t of USS23.0 million was extended
t o t h e Government of India (GOI) i n June 1977.                         The c r e d i t closing date was
extended twice:               t h e f i r s t through March 31, 1984 and t h e second through
December 31, 1985.                 The c r e d i t was f u l l y disbursed by December 17, 1984.         The
developmental constraints (need f o r improved syetem management plans and some
additional complementary works) experienced i n the project were analyzed
and corrective measures were incorporated i n t o t h e follow-on project
(Periyar Vaigai I r r i g a t i o n I1 Project, Credit 1468-IN).

                No s p e c i f i c f i e l d t r i p was made t o c o l l e c t information f o r the PCR.
Information sources used f o r the preparation of t h i s PCR include a d r a f t
completion r e p o r t prepared by t h e Borrower, the s t a f f appraisal report
(Report No. 1519a-IN),                  supervision reports and correspondence f i l e s and
documentation r e l a t e d t o t h e preparation and appraisal of t h e follow-on
project.

                Following a review of the PCR by OED s t a f f , it was decided not t o
a u d i t the project and t h e PCR was sent t o t h e Borrower f o r comment on
March 7, 1986.             Comments received have been appended t o t h e report a s a

                                           EVALUATION SUMMARY


Introduction

1.           The Periyar Vaigai Irrigation Project was the f i r s t major attempt in
India t o minimize water losses i n conveyance and operation by rehabilitation
and modernization of an existing i r r i g a t i o n system.          Water savings were t o be
used t o introduce two crop irrigation i n areas that previously grew only one
irrigated crop per year, and t o bring new areas, previously rainfed, under
irrigation.

Ob jectives

2.           The project supported lining of the i r r i g a t i o n conveyance system t o
the 10 ha o u t l e t ; construction of a link canal; improvements of irrigation
tanks; construction of canal service roads and village roads; strengthening
of the extension services; and extension of the existing canal system t o
u t i l i z e some of the water saved f o r increasing the irrigation command area.
The project cost was estimated a t Re 410.4 M (USS45.6 M) and an IDA credit of
USS23.0 M was approved and was f u l l y disbursed by December 17, 1984.

Imlementation Experience

3.           As a r e s u l t of i n i t i a l delays i n implementation and early indications
of higher than anticipated costs, the project was revised i n 1981.                  The
revised project dropped construction of a link canal and scaled down the
scope of the physical works so a s not t o exceed the original cost estimates.
Following the revision, progress on most project components was satisfactory.

4.           Actual project cost was R s 455 M.            Most of the physical targets s e t
a t appraisal except for those dropped a8 mentioned above were achieved.
Under the project, lining objectives of both main and branch canals (331 km)
were achieved (98% of SAR target) and 648 km of the distributaries have been
lined (61%); 1,512 structures were rehabilitated (111%); 220 tanks improved;
and 2431km of service roads f o r ObM of the canal system and 382 km of village
roads were constructed.              Installation of the communication system was delayed
due t o d i f f i c u l t i e s related t o approval of the wave length by GO1 and the
component was carried over t o the Periyar Vaigai 11. The agricultural exten-
sion services have been reorganized and put under a single l i n e of command.
In 1981, the project extension service was absorbed into t h e statewide exten-
sion project.

5.            A t appraisal, the need t o s e t up two construction c i r c l e s was iden-
t i f i e d ; GOTN s e t up three c i r c l e s , and i n addition, special divisions f o r
quality control, hydrology ( t o check water losses8 and savings), and monitor-
ing and evaluation.            Although i n 1980, there was a shortage of qualified
s t a f f f o r design of watercourses, t h i s d i f f i c u l t y was l a t e r overcome.
Generally, the performance of the implementing agency was s a t i s f a c t o r y a s
reflected by the high quality of c i v i l works, except f o r p a r t s of the road
component.

Results

6 .           It is estimated that as a result of the project, irrigated cropped
area increased by cbout 7,400 ha i n the double crop area, about 8,400 ha i n
the s i n g l e crop area, and about 1,300 ha i n the s i n g l e and summer crop area.
An estimated 52,000 farm families benefitted d i r e c t l y from the project.                          In
addition, creation of a l l weather access t o v i l l a g e s through the road com-
ponent f a c i l i t a t e d flow of a g r i c u l t u r a l inputs i n t o the project area and
improved marketing opportunities.                    Incremental production under the project
is estimated a t 102,000 tons of paddy, 4,200 tons of groundnut, 2,400 ton of
grams and 38,000 tons of sugarcane.                     The actual ERR f o r the project is
estimated a t 18%compared with the appraisal estimate of 17 t o 23%.

S u s t a i n a b i l i t y

7.            The developmental constraints (need f o r improved overall system
management plans and some additional complementary works) experienced i n the
project were analyzed and corrective measures were incorporated i n t o the
f o l l o r o n project (Periyar Vaigai I r r i g a t i o n I1 Project, Credit 1468-IN).

Findings and Lessons

8.            Although the project's        physical t a r g e t s had t o be considerably
revised during execution a s a r e s u l t of higher than expected costs, and
inadequately detailed o r i g i n a l plans, t h e project has been successful i n
achieving its basic objectives and creating a sound base f o r improved opera-
tion and management of the irrigation system (PCR paras 8.01-8.04 )                              .
9.            A major lesson of the project is t h a t lining and r e h a b i l i t a t i o n of
the canal system a r e not s u f f i c i e n t t o a t t a i n f u l l a g r i c u l t u r a l potential.
In addition, canal operation efficiency and improved water management a r e

Background

1.01    Of all the states in India, Tamil Nadu has attained the highest
degree of actual utilization of surface water resources. The Government of
Tamil Nadu (GOTN) estimated the state's irrigation potential at 3.00 M ha in
1980181 of which nearly 86% was utilized as follows:

        Total

1.02    All large-scale surface water resources have been developed and it
has become increasingly costly to develop the remaining unused resources.
With respect to groundwater development, the absence of effective legislation
to control installation of wells 11 has already resulted in overexploitation
of groundwater in many areas.  ~oiietheless,there is still scope for further
groundwater development in some restricted areas but effective use of this
groundwater would require careful planning and control.

1.03    Faced with these severe water resource constraints, the state recog-
nized that further expansion of the irrigated command would require greater
efficiency of water use in existing projects, like the 80-year old Periyar
Vaigai system.  Built to nineteenth century standards, the unlined Periyar
Vaigai conveyance system had high seepage and operational losses.  The GOTN
recognized also that production could be increased considerably by improving
the quality and quantity of irrigation water supply through modernization of
the irrigation system. This was clearly demonstrated in areas with adequate
water supply in Periyar Vaigai, where farmers were producing some of the
highest paddy yields in India.

1.04    In late 1975, the Government of India (GO11 requested Bank assistance
with modernization of the Periyar Vaigai irrigation system.  In fact, the
project was one of the first attempts in India to rehabilitate and modernize
a major irrigation system with emphasis on minimizing seepage and operational
water losses. A reorganization of the agricultural extension services and a
detailed monitoring and evaluation program were to form a part of the project
(hereafter referred to as Periyar Vaigai I).




-11 Small diameter wells (about 100 mm) sunk to a depth of 10-20 m and
    equipped with 3-5 HP centrifugal pumps.

1.05    A follow-on project to finance the second phase of development works
(Periyar Vaigai 11) was appraised in sePtember/0ctober 1983 and approved by
the Board on May 1, 1984 (~r.1468-IN, USS35.0 MI.   The project became effec-
tive on January 10, 1985 with project completion by April 1988. The second
project has incorporated lessons learnt from Periyar Vaigai I.  In addition
to lining, it emphasized improved design, improved system operation, and
water management (para 3.04).

1.06    No specific field trip was made to collect information for the PCR
since adequate data was available on file. Information sources used for the
preparation of this PCR include the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) of the
Periyar Vaigai I (Report No. 1519a-IN), supervision reports and correspon-
dence files and documentation related to the preparation and appraisal of the
follow-up project.

The Periyar Vaigai Irrigation System

1.07    The natural flows in the River Vaigai basin were already fully util-
ized by the end of the nineteenth century and shortage of water to satisfy
the demand in the Periyar Vaigai area has been experienced ever since. The
increasing shortages led to construction of the Periyar trans-basin scheme
which enabled diversion of waters from the Periyar river basin in the state
of Kerala to the Vaigai basin in Tamil Nadu.  A dam and reservoir were con-
structed on the Periyar River and a diversion tunnel through the Western
Ghats made it possible to convey water from the Periyar reservoir into the
tributary of the Vaigai.

1.08    The construction of the Peranai regulator and the Periyar Main Canal
(PMC), on the left bank of the Vaigai, formed part of the trans-basin scheme,
which was completed in 1896.  A major addition to the earlier works was
completion in 1958 of the Vaigai Dam and reservoir about 30 km upstream of
the Peranai regulator.  The primary purpose of this balancing reservoir was
to re-regulate releases from a power station constructed at the end of the
Periyar diversion tunnel.  This additional storage and better control of
river base flow made it possible to extend the irrigation command of the PMC
system and, through construction of the Thirumangalam Main Canal (TMC), to
irrigate lands on the right bank of the River Vaigai.

1.09    Irrigation water to the project area was supplied from four sources:
(i) diversions at the Peranai regulator; (ii) rain water collected in
numerous tanks in the project area; (iii) return flows to tanks from canal
and field losses within the command area; and (iv) groundwater. Most of
1,200 tanks within or adjacent to the canal command area are integrated
within the canal distribution system.

1.10   The total area irrigated under the PMC and TMC projects is about
63,200 ha.  The PMC with a length of 58 km, commands about 57,900 ha through
a system of 12 branch channels and 64 distributaries which convey supplies to
farm turnouts. The TMC with a length of 27 km commands about 5,300 ha.   Both
canal systems are operated and maintained by the Public Works Department
(PWD).

Preparation and Appraisal

1.11     The GOTN was assisted in project preparation by a team from the
FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program.l/   The project was appraised in October
1976 and negotiations held in washington in April 1977.   It was approved by
the Board on June 2, 1977 and the credit became effective September 30, 1977.


                         11.  THE PROJECT AT APPRAISAL


The Pro iect Area

2.01     The project area covers parts of Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts
in southern-central Tamil Nadu.   The gross command area is about 105,000 ha,
of which 66,000 ha are cultivable.   The population in the project area is
about 390,000, of which 30,000 belong to non-farm households.   The average
family size is 4.9 persons.   The area is densely populated (5.9 persons per
cultivated ha) and farm sizes are relatively small, averaging about 1.3 ha.
About 10% of the holdings are tenant operated usually through sharecropping
on a 50 to 50 ratio.   Madurai, Tamil ~adu'ssecond largest town with a
population of 550,000 (19711, is located on the fringe of the project area.
It is served by main road, rail and air links to Madras and other important
centers.

Project Components

2.02     The main project components were:

   (a)   Canal Lining.  Lining of all irrigation canals down to
         turnouts serving blocks of about 10 ha.

   (b)   Link Canal.  Construction of a lined link canal (length
         32 km) to convey river water from a new diversion weir
         just downstream of the Vaigai Dam to the Peranai regulator.

Financine

2.04    The credit of USS23.0 M was to finance 50% of the total project cost
covering the foreign exchange component of USS6.9 million and 42% of local
costs. The credit was made to GO1 and was to be channelled to GOTN on the
standard terms and arrangements for development assistance to the states.
With this assistance, GOTN was to finance all capital investments from its
development budget.  O&M costs was to be financed by GOTN from its own
resources.

Procurement

2.05    The estimated cost of vehicles and equipment for project management,
project monitoring, O&M and the extension program was estimated at
US$660,000.  Procurement of equipment (mainly communication system and
loaders) totaling an estimated US$290,000 was to be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB) and the balance (US$370,000) for procuring field
vehicles and other equipment (small off-the-shelf items) costing less than
US$100,000 for each order through normal procurement procedures of GOTN.
Procurement of civil works on the link canal was to be by ICB.  The remaining
civil works, which were mostly small, labor intensive and scattered over the
wide areas, were to be carried out by local contractors through local com-
petitive bidding (LCB).

Implementation Organization

2.06    Project implementation was to take four years with completion by the
end of December 1981. The Public Works Department (PWD) was to be respon-
sible for supervising and coordinating planning and implementation of all
services and works required for the development of irrigation (design, con-
struction and O&M).  The Department of Agriculture (DOA) was to be respon-
sible for the reorganization and strengthening of agricultural extension
services.

Benefits

2.07    The project planned to rehabilitate an existing irrigation system
commanding some 63,200 ha and extend irrigation to a further 9,000 ha of
rainfed area.  It was estimated that at full development, the project would
increase paddy production by about 64,000 tons and result in creation of
about 12,000 and 8,000 additional full time jobs in farm and non-farm sec-
tors, respectively. The increased foodgrain production was estimated at
about USS9.6 M annually valued at projected international prices.  The
economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was estimated at 17% with water
used in the extended command area to provide one irrigated crop in rainfed
areas, and at 23% when water is used for providing a second crop in areas
already irrigated.  Any combination of the two alternatives was expected to
give an ERR between these two limits.

                        111. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION


Effectiveness and Start-Up

3.01    The project made a good start with early mobilization of resources
and staff required to meet the project implementation schedule.  The GOTN
promptly set in place a project organization which was potentially even
stronger than agreed at appraisal (para 4.01).  However, some of the work
program and other undertakings to be initiated in the first year of implemen-
tation (1977) were delayed. These included:   (i) carrying out of
agro-economic survey in the project area; (ii) organizing agricultural exten-
sion services following the Training and Visit (T6V) system; and (iii) under-
taking the hydrological component to monitor canal flows and thus assess the
impact of canal lining.

3.02    Implementation of civil works was much slower than anticipated
because of (i) poor response to tender calls mainly from small local contrac-
tors, who initially did not have experience in this type of work; (ii) the
fact that several contractors were unable to carry out the extent of works as
specified in the contract and broke their contracts; (iii) shortage of
qualified staff for investigation, survey and design work for the smaller
distributaries; and (iv) occasional cement shortages.

Revision

3.03    As the implementation of the project progressed, it became evident
that the physical targets set at appraisal could not be achieved. The main
reason was that the cost of civil works was much higher than expected at
appraisal (para 3.17) in part due to the implementation delays experienced
(para 3.02), and in part because the appraisal estimates were not based on
sufficiently broad experience.

3.04    These problems prompted IDA to mount a comprehensive review mission
in 1981. The mission recommended that GOTN revise the project to ensure that
the planned total project cost would be within the financial resources avail-
able; this would need to be achieved by scaling down the magnitude of the
physical works for various components. The IDA suggested to GOTN that the
construction of the link canal be postponed, since newly available informa-
tion suggested that it would not actually contribute to water savings (para
3.06).  The GOTN agreed with these recommendations.  The review mission also
reported that even with the improvement works on the main conveyance system,
water supply to large areas downstream would continue to be insufficient and
unreliable.  It was concluded that water management improvements, par-
ticularly with respect to an improved systems operation, provision for which
were not included under the project, would be necessary to fully achieve the
main project objectives. Consequently, it was agreed that a follow-on
~rojectwould be needed to consolidate and complement the achievements of the
project (para 1.05).  Following some delays, the revised project scope was
approved by IDA in March 1983. Since the revision, project implementation
has progressed satisfactorily. The Closing Date was extended twice:   the
first extension was approved on September 3, 1983 by IDA through March 31,

1984 and the second extension approved on March 16, 1984 through December 31,
1984.



3.05          u.The                main feature of the project was lining of a l l canals
down t o o u t l e t s serving 10 ha blocks, t o ensure a r e l i a b l e water supply a t
the farm level.               The lining of the TMC, which was the only lined canal in the
project area, was t o be rehabilitated.                    The lining work was slow during early
years mainly due t o t h e f a c t that:             ( i ) when the project was appraised i n
1976, experience i n India with high quality lining was limited, and r e l i a b l e
unit costs f o r t h i s type of work were not available;2/ ( i i ) there was a
shortage of experienced contractors; and ( i i i ) PWD was inexperienced i n the
management of t h i s type of work.               Prior t o project revision, GQTN indicated
t o IDA that, while they agreed t o l i n e the main canal and the major branch
canals, they did not want t o proceed with lining of the smaller dis-
t r i b u t a r i e s and minors.        The reasons f o r the limited lining program given by
GOTN were that:               ( i ) GOTN calculation indicated lower than expected water
savings from lining d i s t r i b u t a r i e s and minors;3/ and ( i i ) opposition from the
farmers t o acquisition of land required t o widen the existing right-of-way
and extend the conveyance system from the 30-100 ha o u t l e t s a t present t o 10
ha outlets.d/              IDA suggested t h a t the GOTN continue with an experimental
lining program i n two branch canal convnand areas and postpone a decision on
the extent of the lining u n t i l r e s u l t s of water loss measurements became
available.             The GOTN agreed, i n l a t e 1981, t o carry out experimental lining
t o 10 ha o u t l e t s on a p i l o t scale.        This p i l o t program proved t o be success-
f u l and has allayed e a r l i e r reservations on the part of PWD concerning the
effectiveness of lining smaller canals.                    Under the p i l o t program, it was
found that water was delivered t o farm o u t l e t s more reliably, and was reach-
ing tailenders much f a s t e r , which helped t o speed up land preparation and
increase yields.               Also, farmers response was positive.           Since the positive
r e s u l t s of the experimental lining program, lining works have progressed
s a t i s f a c t o r i l y and t h e i r quality has been high.      The following table sum-

3.06    Link Canal.  Water for the Periyar Vaigai system is conveyed from
Vaigai reservoir to Peranai regulator through the Vaigai river channel.     At
appraisal, the PWD emphasized the need to construct a link canal mainly to
save water losses averaging about 50 MCM in the Vaigai river between Vaigai
reservoir and the regulator.    Additionally, there were serious difficulties
in operating the head regulator because of siltation in front of the gates
and siltation in the head reaches of the main canals restricted intake
capacities in offtaking canals.    Consequently, construction of the link canal
was included in the project but it was agreed that river flows would be
monitored to review the perceived seepage losses in the river channel.     The
actual measurement was delayed and in late 1981, the Bank recommended to
defer a final decision on the construction of link canal until study results
had been completed.

3.07    With respect to water losses from the river, the PWD monitored the
river flows in order to assess such losses; stream flow velocities and river
cross sections were measured downstream of the Vaigai dam and upstream of
Peranai regulator.  The measurements were based on difference in river dis-
charges at the two points which indicated that river losses during the opera-
tion period of the PMC amounted to about 38 MCM.     However, the supervision
mission of November 1981 learned that actual losses were much smaller.    There
were about 150 5-HP pumps and 100 bullock/hand powered lifting devices
installed along both banks of the river, irrigating about 800 ha.    These
pumps utilized about 20 MCM during the irrigation season.     Thus a large part
of the assumed water losses from the Vaigai river were not losses (as
reported by PWD at appraisal) but utilization of river water for direct
pumped irrigation.  Since the construction of the link canal would have
eliminated low flows in the river, it would have seriously affected the
cultivators pumping directly from the river or operating dugwells close to
the river.  It was concluded that such losses would outweigh the benefits
expected as a result of constructing the link canal.

3.08    After it became clear that only a limited amount of water would be
saved by constructing the link canal, its remaining main merit was to be its
contribution to the alleviation of the siltation problem.     However, serious
doubts were raised as to whether construction of a link canal would be the
most economical way of solving the siltation problem.l/In February 1981, the
Bank requested GOTN to consider remodeling the intakes at the head of the
main canals including provision of desilting basins, and to prepare prelimi-
nary designs and cost estimates.    While this exercise was underway, a final


-1/ See item (iii) of the   or rower's colmnentsin Supplement.

decision on construction of the link canal was deferred.   The study was not
carried out and after further reviews of siltation problems in 1983 and 1984
by the Bank, a modification to the Peranai headworks was proposed.   This
modification in essence would provide a mechanically cleared river forebay
and a separate skimming wall structure in front of the regulator intake
vents.  The GOTN undertook hydraulic model studies and a provision of Rs 17 M
was included for that purpose in the follow-on project, the Periyar Vaigai I1
project.  It became evident that construction of the link canal had a low
priority within the proposed package of improvements, and it was formally
dropped in 1983.

3.09    Rehabilitation of Structures.  Existing structures on main, branch
and distributary canals needed remodeling or repair for effective regulation
of water supplies and minimization of operation and other losses within the
canal system.  Some head regulators of channels taking off from PMC, TMC and
branch canals were so badly deteriorated that it was impossible to control
discharge into distributaries.  It was concluded that for effective water
management, rehabilitation or improvements to existing regulatory structures
were essential.  At appraisal, it was estimated that about 1,360 old and new
structures 11 would be remodeled or constructed.  The following table sum-
marizes the-actual achievements compared with appraisal targets:

3.10    Improvements to Existing Tanks.  Tanks in the project area receive
their water from the canal system, rainfall runoff and return flows from
irrigated lands within the tank catchments.  Some of the major tanks which
were connected to the canal system through other tanks (which restricted
timely water delivery) and tanks in the extension areas outside the PMC
system which were mostly rainfed were to be provided with an independent
supply channel under the project.  At appraisal, it was estimated that about
700 tanks in the Left bank and about 420 tanks in the extension area were to
be improved.  During revision (para 3.041, the component was reduced to 220
tanks in the left bank area which were subsequently implemented.

roads; the component included about 680 km i n l e f t bank command, 45 km i n
right bank command and 140 km within the extension area below Pulipatti
regulator.    During implementation, it became clear that the actual amount of
road requiring improvement o r construction would be 209 km i n l e f t bank
command, 35 km i n right bank command and none within the extension area.
Although i n i t i a l l y implemeptation was delayed mainly due t o scarcity of

village roads would need improvement.             During implementation, it became clear
that the road length was 290 km i n the l e f t bank command, 56 km i n the right
bank command and 56 km in extension area command, a t o t a l of 402 km.                   The

3.13           Although t h i s component (as revised) was substantially completed,
construction quality has been lower than anticipated a t appraisal.                         For
example, a t many places, roads have been constructed through tank beds
without adequate banking and foundations.                Similarly design of road sections
located along the top of tank bunds could be improved.                    A t appraisal, it was
agreed t h a t GOTN would provide about 375 km of gravel roads i n the l e f t bank
command 11 with a 2.5 m wide pavement on a 5.5 m foundation. This minimum
road width was not always followed and maintenance has generally been poor.J/

A detailed breakdown of actual project expenditures by components compared to
appraisal estimates is given in Table 2, and a summary of expenditures by
years in Table 3.  Up to September 1984, project expenditures were Rs 454.7 M
(USS50.7 M) - compared to appraisal estimates of Rs 410.4 M.
            11

3.18    At appraisal, total project was estimated at Rs 410.4 H.   The revised
estimate of expenditures to project completion (as assessed in mid-1980
without revising the project scope) amounted to Rs 896 M (see Table 2).   The
main reason for underestimating the project cost at appraisal (1976) appears
to have been the lack of experience with lining; in 1976, experience in India
with high quality canal lining was limited and thus cost estimates, based on
actual implementation, were not available.  Even though the PWDtsunit rates
for earthwork provided during project preparation were increased by 25% in




-11 Total US dollar expenditures were calculated by dividing total annual
    Rupee expenditures by the then prevailing average conversion rate in US
    dollars for each year of the project period.

deriving the appraisal estimate, the contractors' lowest bids were still
30-40% higher than the latter.   In addition, annual cost increases for labor,
cement and other key materials were much higher than anticipated at
appraisal, averaging 15-25% per year.   The increase in the civil works costs
during the project period has contributed to about half of the total increase
in project cost.   The balance resulted from higher than estimated engineer-
ing, supervision and administration costs since the works were small,
widespread, and seasonal executed under small contracts which required more
supervision than anticipated. Another reason for increased costs was an
underestimation of rehabilitation required both in terms of number of struc-
tures and length of canals per unit of command area; appraisal cost estimates
for these works were based on an assessment of works required per unit area
rather than on a detailed design. In addition, work contemplated at
appraisal as minor rehabilitation of existing structures in many cases turned
out to be substantial restoration, or even replacement involving costs
greatly exceeding estimates.

Disbursement

3.19     In spite of the initial delay in project start-up, disbursements at
the end of the first fiscal year of project implementation exceeded appraisal
estimates.   The disbursement rate declined in succeeding years and only about
64% of the credit was disbursed by the original credit closing date of June
30, 1983. The credit was fully disbursed by December 17, 1984.    Table 4
summarizes disbursements from FYI978 to FY1985.

Procurement

3.20     Vehicles and small off-the-shelf equipment were procured locally
through normal procurement procedures of GOTN.   ICB was called for the con-
struction of the link canal. However, tender response was poor, and bid
prices far exceeded cost estimates, for which reason no award was made.
Subsequently, the construction of the link canal was abandoned (paras 3.06
and 3.08).   The remaining civil works were basically for modernizing the
existing canal systems and lining of minor distributaries.   Since the work
had to be carried out only during the canal closure period (about 3 months
per year) and the works were small in size and scattered widely in remote
areas, procurement under the project was on the basis of local competitive
bidding (LCB).   As big contractors were not interested in such works, most
works under the project were broken down into small contracts and were
awarded to small contractors.   Procurement of VHF equipment was originally
planned to be made through ICB as the costs were estimated to be over
US$100,000.   However, as a number of items such as the tower, the mobile
units, etc. had to be procured separately, these items were procured through
LCB.

Compliance with Covenants (~nnex1)

3.21     The GOTN complied with most of the important covenants in a timely
manner.   Project audit reports furnished by GOTN were satisfactory and on
time (para 4.05).

                       IV.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE


Public Works Department (PWD)

4.01    Implementation of the engineering aspect of the project was the
responsibility of the PWD.  The Chief Engineer (cE) of the Irrigation Branch
(PWD) exercises control over design, construction, and operation of all
irrigation projects in the State.  For construction, the SAR specified the
setting up of two construction circles; GOTN set up three circles with four
divisions under each circle.  In addition, GOTN created special divisions for
Quality Control, Hydrology (to measure canal flows and estimate water losses)
and Monitoring (to monitor physical progress).  To oversee these three divi-
sions, a Senior Deputy Chief Engineer's post was created.  The GOTN'S effort
to build up its implementation capability was generally commendable, although
in 1980, there was a shortage of qualified staff for watercourse design; this
shortcoming was later rectified when the activities relating to the construc-
tion of field channels and the distribution of water to the farmers were
placed under overall charge of another CE in the Agricultural Engineering
Department of DOA.  By March 1982, construction of smaller canals, mostly
below the sluice outlets, had increased to about 145 km/year. Performance of
the staff engaged in the project has been generally responsible and dedi-
cated, as reflected by the high quality of lining work.  The quality of some
of the road work was less impressive.

4.02    The OLM of the project has been controlled by the Madurai Circle of
the PWD under a CE.  An Executive Engineer (EE) is responsible for the
Periyar Vaigai system while ObM staff of the Periyar and Thirumangalam
irrigation systems is headed by an Assistant Executive Engineer (AEE).
Recognizing the importance of ObM, GOTN is strengthening the 06M organization
under the Periyar Vaigai I1 Project.  In particular, the post of AEE is being
upgraded to EE assisted by four AE and 16 Junior Engineers.

Reorganization of Agricultural Extension Services

4.03    The project provided for introduction of the Training and Visit (TLV)
system of agricultural extension in the entire Madurai district and part of
the Ramanathapuram district.  Under the system, regular demonstrations and
up-to-date advice on farming practices were provided to farmers through
regular fortnightly visits by trained Village Extension Workers (VEW).  The
program called for reorganization of extension staff to work exclusively on
extension under a single line of command. The project provided for increased
staff to provide adequate field coverage aiming at one VEW serving about 650
farm families.  The reorganization of the extension service was the respon-
sibility of the DOA.

4.04    The extension activity initially was delayed because necessary
Government Orders for creating a single line of command were not issued until
April 1980.  Since then, progress has been satisfactory and in 1981, GOTN
extended the T6V system statewide under the IDA assisted Tamil Nadu Agricul-
tural Extension Project (Cr. 1137-IN); when this project became effective,
the extension component under the Periyar Vaigai project I, was integrated
into the statewide extension system.  Under the statewide T6V extension

service, one VEW serves about 800 farm families.                          The performance of the
Tamil Nadu Agricultural Extension Project is reported a s being satisfactory.



4.05           The PWD (for physical works) and the DOA (for agricultural extension)
maintained separate accounts on project expenditures.                          The project had an
excellent accounting systems f o r recording expenditures both according t o
accounts classification of the GOTN and appraisal report headings.                          The
audits confirmed proper management of the funds allocated t o the project.
The financial statements of expenditures f o r the FY1984185, due by December
31, 1985, is still awaited.J/
Monitorian

4.06            Estimation of seepage losses before and a f t e r canal lining was car-
ried out by the Hydrology division and physical progress of the project
checked by the Monitoring division.                  Nineteen flow recording stations have
been constructed i n t h e existing area and the balance (about 11 stations) i n
the extension area w i l l be constructed under the Periyar Vaigai I1 Project.
The Quality Control division succeeded i n ensuring good quality work.
Assessment of the agricultural and economic impact of the project was carried
out by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

Cost R e c o v w

4.07            The water charges i n Tamil Nadu a r e based on a matrix with land
c l a s s i f i c a t i o n on one a x i s and quality of i r r i g a t i o n service on the other
axis.        This matrix a t present features 14 categories of s o i l s and f i v e
categories relating t o i r r i g a t i o n service.          The water charge indicator gener-
ated by land classification and i r r i g a t i o n quality, the r a t e of water charge
is further modified t o incorporate relative access from the farming villages
t o public f a c i l i t i e s like markets, railroad stations, roads, and industrial
areas.          The same r a t e applies t o both high and low water consuming crops.
Unlike the uniform water charge applicable statewide in most other s t a t e s i n
India, the schedule of water charges i n Tamil Nadu varies between d i s t r i c t s
and even between projects.                  The farmers pay an average of about R s 94/ha i n
water charges, and the collection r a t e is close t o 100%. A t appraisal, the
cost recovery objective stipulated was t o ensure recovery of annual ObM costs
and, t o the extent possible, generate funds t h a t could be used f o r subsequent
rehabilitation and modernization works.                  A review of water charges and water
related charges was included i n the project.                     In early 1978, GOTN s e t up a
conunittee on rationalization of water rates.                     A review'report by the Commit-
t e e was submitted t o IDA i n September 1979.                 The recornendations of the
Committee were not considered appropriate by IDA because they:did not recom-
mend any significant changes and thus could r e s u l t i n l i t t l e improvement i f
any over the existing water charge system.                    The possibility of simiplifying
and rationalizing the complex system of water charges has since been recog-
nized by GOTN.               Consequently, during appraisal of the Periyar Vaigai I1

project, another study was included under that project primarily t o formulate
practical procedures f o r simplifying the system.

4.08     When referring t o cost recovery it is important t o assess also the
indirect recovery.       According t o the SAR f o r the Periyar Vaigai I1 project,
indirect recovery consisted mainly of taxes on conrmercial crops amounting t o
Re 30-50/ha and compulsory procurement a t a price considerably below,the
market averaging about Re 3001ha.        Thus the amount of indirect recovery was
considerably higher than the direct one.


                                V.  AGRICULTURAL IMPACT

General

5 0 1    The project was designed t o increase system efficiency through reduc-
tion i n seepage and operational losses and by replacing deteriorating canal
inf rastructure.      It has been generally successful in achieving the objective
of saving water.      Based on extensive measurements, expected water savings
                                                                                                3

                                                        !3                  about 188 Mm
compared with the appraisal estimate of 190 Mm             (Table 5).

_IrrinebleArea

5.02     At appraisal, three possible alternatives were identified f o r use of
water saved by lining.       These were:     ( i ) intensification of i r r i g a t i o n i n t h e
existing command areas; ( i i ) extension of the existing command areas by about
9,000 ha, with any additional water saved used t o intensify i r r i g a t i o n sup-
plies t o existing command areas; and ( i i i ) use of a l l saved water t o develop
about 25,000 ha of new areas.       A11 these options gave satisfactory economic
returns, but option ( i i ) was adopted a s the basic project objective.                 I n
1979, GOTN selected the following three extension areas t o be included under
the project.




                ( i )  Area beyond the TMC cornmand                  950

              ( i i j Area below P u l i p a t t i regulator      7,600

             ( i i i )  Non-irrigated areas within
                        existing command                          1.750
                                                                 10,300

A breakdown of conrmand areas by cropping patterns is summarized below (see
Table 6 for details):

Of these areas, the areas served by direct irrigation sources compared to
indirect sources (i.e. use of tanks) is as follows:


       Direct                    34,987         4,951          39,938

       Indirect
            Total


5.03    In early 1980, GOTN proposed that in the extension area it would
provide the irrigation distribution system to serve only the existing tank
commands and delete areas to be served directly from the canal system (about
3,600 pa in area below Pulipatti regulator).  This action would have reduced
the total cost of works only marginally, but sharply increased the cost per
irrigated ha from about Rs 13,000 to Rs 22,000.  As a result, the estimated
return on investments would have become unacceptably low.     IDA indicated to
GOTN that exclusion of the direct irrigation command in the extension area
would reduce economic viability of the component to an unacceptably low
level.  Late in 1981, GOTN reversed its proposal and agreed to proceed with
extending the irrigation distribution system to direct command area as
originally planned.

Aericultural Production and Yields

5.04    The water savings from canal lining and improved system management
are expected to extend the command area by about 10,305 ha compared to the
appraisal estimate of 9,000 ha.  The improvements in canal operation and
water management are expected to result in a more reliable, timely and equi-
table water supply within the existing command (63,243 ha) and especially
benefit tailenders cultivating about one-third of the command area.    The
following table compares cropping intensities as estimated at appraisal with
PCR estimates at full development (see Table 7 for details).

-11 In Tamil Nadu the cultivated land is classified on the basis of the
    availability of irrigation water:  double crop area applies to the
    land where paddy can be grown twice a year in a given unit area;
    single crop area implies to the land where paddy can be grown at
    least once followed by other crops.

The above data on agricultural performance indicators described above are
based on the data collected for the appraisal of the Periyar Vaigai I1
project since updated data were not available for the preparation of this
PCR.  Cropping patterns and yields for the 'future with project' condition
have been estimated taking into account:  (i) the increased availability of
canal water; and (ii) better timing and reliability of irrigation supplies.

5.05    The yield of paddy is expected to increase since more reliable water
supply would encourage farmers to use more production inputs and adopt
improved cultural practices associated with improved irrigation techniques.
In particular, tailend farmers who have historically suffered from lack of
reliable water supplies would be able to grow their paddy to full maturity
with an improved irrigation service.  Present and estimated crop yields are
given in Table 8. Pilot surveys conducted on fields in several villages in
the project area show that paddy yield increased under well managed irriga-
tion from about 4.2 t/ha to 5.3 t/ha, an increase of about 27% (see Table 9).
Under the 'future with project' situation for this PCR, yields of paddy have
been conservatively estimated to average about 3.8 tlha for the entire
project command areas.

5.06   Based on the expected future cropping patterns and yields levels,
crop production for the 'future with project' situation is given in Table
10 and summarized below:

Economic Rate of Return (ERR)

6.01    The economic viability of the project has been reassessed, taking
into account actual implementation schedule, actual incurred costs, and the
cropping patterns, yields and economic prices shown in Tables 7, 8 and 11.
At appraisal, the estimated ERR ranged between 17% and 23%, depending on how
the saved water was used (para 2.07).   The consolidated costs and benefit
streams for this PCR, based on historical data between 1977-1983 and projec-
tions thereafter, given an estimated ERR of 18%.     The calculation of this ERR
did not take into account the benefits from improved system operation intro-
duced under the Periyar Vaigai I1 project.   The ERR arising from exclusive
use of water saved within the extension of the command area is estimated at
25% and from use within the existing command area at 15%.        The reassessed ERR
is well within the range estimated at appraisal which confirms that project
investments have been sound. The cost and benefit streams for the analysis
are given in Table 12.


                          VII.   THE BANK PERFORMANCE

Pre~arationand A~~raisal

7.01    The GOTN started preparing the project as early as 1964 without
technical assistance and it took a further 12 years until the project was
appraised.  The project was not prepared in sufficient detail which resulted
in implementation delays and much higher than expected unit costs (~ara
3.17).  As pointed out earlier (paras 3.05-3.131,    PWD's planning assumptions
of the proposed link canal were vague and the scope and scale of other major
project works were based on incomplete planning.     The SAR identified the key
project components required to overcome deficiencies in the existing system;
in particular, it confirmed the need for lining of canal systems down to a
10 ha outlet and the installation of sufficient control structures to ensure
efficient water delivery.   The SAR also outlined a well-balanced development
plan for overcoming constraints that could otherwise have impeded improvement

of the agricultural performance.   However, in retrospect, it appears that in
view of the limited experience with lining, greater precautions should have
been taken both in assessing the project costs and in defining the scope and
scale of works in the various categories.

Supervision

7.02    Twelve supervision missions visited the project at an average inter-
val of about six months.  The size of the missions ranged from one to five
members and averaged 2.3.  Following each mission, comprehensive letters
summarizing the main findings were sent to GO1 and GOTN, which generally
indicated the full range of corrective actions required.   Supervision mis-
sions were generally mindful of needs to help consider and make improvements
to the project concept; for example, GOTN was persuaded: (i) to drop con-
struction of the link canal (para 3.08);  (ii) to undertake pilot schemes to
test the benefits of lining to 10 ha outlets (para 3.05); and (iii) to
reverse their earlier decision that construction of irrigation works be
limited only to the existing tank commands (para 5.03).

7.03    The Bank was flexible in readjusting appraisal targets when it became
apparent that the appraisal proposal could not be achieved because the
increase in costs (para 3.16).  The project was reformulated and the
appraisal targets revised.   During the project period, the Bank realized that
insufficient attention had been given to improving system operations and
water management; additional components were necessary to fully achieve the
project objectives.  Consequently, the Bank agreed with GOTN to consolidate
and complement the project activities through a follow up project (para
3.04).

                   VIII.   LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION


Water Management

8.01    Prior to the project, lack of sufficient field channels and drains
meant that irrigation was field to field below the outlet.  Farmers in the
upper reaches tended to pond their fields with more water than the crop
required at the expense of tailend farmers.  The consequence was that tailend
farmers received an irrigation supply which was unreliable and unpredicable
and generally inadequate for effective irrigated agriculture.  Within the
project area, a delay of upto one month was common in farming operations
between the upper and the lower reach farmers.  The situation was more
pronounced in drier years.  Although farmers in the existing command area had
water rights for at least one paddy crop a year, tailend farmers generally
did not receive adequate water to bring paddy to full maturity in most years.
In the absence of sufficient field channels and drains, farmers could not
diversify their crops especially in dry years when water supply may not be
sufficient to grow paddy.  At present, in areas without field channels
farmers are still compelled to grow paddy since upland crops cannot be grown
satisfactorily under a field-to-field irrigation system.

8.02    During the course of implementation, it has become clear that the
lining and rehabilitation works of the canal system were not in themselves

sufficient to attain the full agricultural potential of the area (in par-
ticular, the high yields in paddy cultivation that were targetted at
appraisal and the encouragement of crop diversification).  To achieve these
objectives, it was conciuded that the canal operation efficiency had to be
improved together with improvements in water management throughout the canal
system; these elements have been incorporated into the follow up Periyar
Vaigai I1 Project.  Under this project, the focus has been on construction of
additional field channels, introduction of the rotational water supply prin-
ciple and improved water management practices on individual farms.

8.03    The project focused on improvement of design principles and efficient
implementation of works, since it was believed that completion of the irriga-
tion network was a precondition to an efficient operation. While the project
area had an established water management system, the possibilities of improv-
ing management aspects were not considered in sufficient detail.  Under the
Periyar Vaigai I1 project, emphasis has been on improvements in operational
managemen: and organization of water distribution to fully utilize the
infrastructure constructed under the first project.  The COTN now is strongly
committed to the introduction of rotational water supply principles on the
premise that this will enable provision of a reliable, timely and equitable
water supply to all farmers within the command area.

Conclusions

8.04    Although the project lagged behind the implementation schedule, and
had be be reformulated (in physical terms) to reflect both higher than
expected unit costs and some inadequately detailed original planning, it was
implemented successfully and achieved its main objectives. The quality of
works, except for some of the roads, was good.  The water savings from lining
have provided a more assured water supply to the extension of the existing
command areas, with residual water used to intensify the irrigation in the
existing areas, The performance of completed works indicates that the
improved standards introduced under the project result in a major improvement
over traditional designs and have been well received by the beneficiaries.
The project has promoted institutional building by supporting the creation of
an additional construction circle and three special divisions to undertake
quality control, hydrology and monitoring. The lessons learned in implernent-
ing the project have been incorporated in the formulation of the follow-on
       .
