MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Uganda for SDR 14.1 million (US$ 18.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on staniard IDA terms
and would help finance highway rehabilitation and strengthening.
2.       Background.  At independence in 1962, Uganda inherited a very good
transport system. The system was further improved during the decade 1962-
72 to become one of the best in sub-saharan Africa. However, after years
of neglect and ultimate destruction during the war in 1978/79 and its
aftermath, the transport system was left in disarray. Deterioration has
been particularly severe for trunk roads serving transit traffic (to Kenya,
Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire and Sudan), where high volumes and heavy loads have
caused structural damage and made roads difficult and dangerous for
traffic. The transport infrastructure comprises about 26,200 km of roads,
of which about 2,000 are paved; a railway system totalling 1,350 km; a port
in Jinja on Lake Victoria providing a rail-ferry link to Tanzania and
Kenya; an international airport at Entebbe, and eleven domestic airfields.
Two ministries share responsibility for the transport sector, the Ministry
of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Works (MOW). MOW is responsible for the
planning, construction and maintenance of the classified road network
(7,819 km), while local Governments are responsible for the rest (about
18,400 km). The MHW's organization, though understaffed, is structurally
sound. Revenues from road user charges are well in excess of highway
maintenance costs.
3.       The rehabilitation of Uganda's road transport is crucial to the
country's economic recovery. Road transport has an important role in the
import of essential commodities, particularly petroleum, and in exporting
goods, mostly coffee, tea, cotton and tobacco. The priority aim of
Government's 1982-84 initial Recovery Program and the 1985/86-1988189
Investment Plan in the transport sector is to limit further deterioration
of the main transport network, and in particular, the essential trunk
routes serving local and transit traffic to other land-locked countries.
Engineering investigations for: (i) the Kampala-Jinja Road; (ii) the
Mbarara-Ishaka-Katunguru Road; and (iii) the Mbarara-Rubarare Road (a total
of 279 km) were carried out in 1983 with financing under a Technical
Assistance Credit (1077-UG) and these roads comprise the highway
rehabilitation program, which forms part of the Government's Investment
Plan. IDA will finance part of the program under the proposed project (84
km), while other parts (totalling 195 km) will be financed or are being
considered for financing by AfDBIEEC, separately.



-2-
4.       Procit Oble1tivs.  Tho objecttves of the proposed project are
tot (i) protect capital investment *nd to increase the service life of
essential trunk roads serving local and trnsit traffic to other land-
locked countries; (it) help Improve maintenance planning and operations of
rural/feeder roads serving agricultural areas; and (iii) strengthen
institutions responsible for project implementation.
5.        Lroject Descripti_n.  The projoct would consist oft (i)
rehabilitationistrengthening of the Kampala-Jinja Road (km 0-24) and the
Mbarara-Ishaka Road for which bids have been received, and related
supervision; (ii) pilot rural road maintenance program; (iWi) technical
assistance; and (iv) feasibility study and, if feasible, detailed
engineering of the Soroti-Lira Road. The road passes through a major
cotton growing area and connects the two Important towns of Soroti and
Lira, where a spinning mill is situated. This road is the only unpaved
section of the Tororo-Mbale-Soroti-Lira-Gulu Road and the traffic between
Tororo and Gulu at present follows a circuitous route via Kampala. The
pilot rural road maintenance program included in the project will assist in
determining how maintenance planning and operations of the rural/feeder
road system can be improved. The technical assistance will comprise a
highway engineer (project coordinator) and two road design engineers for a
period of 30 months each to assist with project coordination and to help
train freshly graduated engineers in the MOW's design and materials
laboratory sections. It also includes a rural road maintenance engineer to
assist HLG with the preparation and implemeatation of the pilot rural
maintenance program.
6.       The total cost of the project including contingencies is estimated
at US$ 21.8 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$18 million or
82%. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Uganda are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of Uganda (IBRD No. 19263)
showing project locations is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 5938-UG dated April 27, 1987 is being distributed separately.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of the Association's lending strategy to support Government efforts to
rehabilitate and maintain essential infrastructure needed for resumed
growth of the productive sectors. This entails high priority for the
transport sector tot (i) arrest further deterioration of the road network
by strengthening road maintenance capacity. The ongoing Third Highway
Project, which is off to a good start after initial delays, supports a
program to improve maintenance of the classified road network; ($i)
rehabilitate roads of key economic importance (proposed project) and assist
Government in mobilizing donor support for the highway rehabilitation
program; and (iii) rehabilitate the railways and assist with sector-wide
training (a proposed transport project is tentatively planned for FY90).



-3-
8.      A&reed Actina.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (a) to review with the Association, not later than four months
before the beginning of each fiscal year, its highway investment Plan, as
well as the budgetary requirements and the proposed budgetary allocation
for road maintenance over the period FY1988-93. In the event of any
shortfall in the maintenance allocation, the Government would make it up in
the subsequent year; (b) submission f^r the Association's review of the
pilot rural road maintenance program prior to its implementation; and (c)
filling of vacant positions of Chief Planning Engineer and Chief Road
Maintenance Engineer in the MOW not later than October 31, 1987. Condition
of credit effectiveness is that the Government has opened a special account
with a commercial bank to serve as a revolving fund for IDA eligible
expenditures.
9.       Justification.  The project includes the rehabilitation/
strengthening of 84 km of the most seriously deteriorated sections of the
highest priority roads in the country which connect some of the more
populated areas of Uganda, with some 20% of the total Ugandan population.
This includes not only the most industrialized area but also some of the
best agricultural districts.  The main benefit of the highway
rehabilitationlstrengthening will be its impact on reducing vehicle
operating costs, and transport users and consumers alike would benefit from
the resulting reduced costs. Improved road conditions will allow better
access to productive areas, provide cheaper and more reliable transport,
arrest deterioration of the roads and improve the capacity for future
maintenance by MOW. The o-erall economic return for the project is 47% for
all quantitatively analyzed components, representing 83% of total project
cost. For the Kampala-Jinja Road (km 0-24), the best estimate rate of
return is 63% and for the Mbarara-Ishaka Road 30%.
10.      Risk.  The main risk facing project implementation is related to
the economic conditions in the country which may lead to a decline in the
availability of local funds for the project. Also, the possibility exists
that implementation is delayed due to MOW's lack of administrative
capacity, but this risk has been minimized because the road rehabilitation/
strengthening works included in the project will be carried out by
contractors.
11.      Recoumendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
