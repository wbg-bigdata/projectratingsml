FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1803-UG)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fourth Highway
Project in Uganda for which Credit 1803-UG in the amount of SDR 14.1 million
(US$18.0 million equivalent) was approved on May 21, 1987 and made effective on
September 11, 1987.
The Credit was closed on December 31, 1994, compared with the original closing
date of December 31, 1993. Final disbursement took place on March 15, 1995, at which
time a balance of SDR 1,014,646.55 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. S.L. Kathuria, Task Manager, AF2EI of the Africa
Region and reviewed by Mr. Stephen Weissman, Chief, AF2EI, ad Mr. Surendra
Agarwal, Project Adviser, AF2DR.
Preparations of this ICR was begun during the Bank's completion mission during
January 1995. It is based on materials in the project file. The borrower contributed to
preparation of the ICR by preparing own evaluation of the project's execution and initial
preparation.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Uganda's transport infrastructure comprises some 28,400 km of roads, a railway
system totaling 1,232 km, a port on Lake Victoria providing rail-ferry link to Tanzania, an
international airport at Entebbe and eleven domestic airfields. Of the total 28,400 km of the
country's road network, some 8,000 km form the classified road network and the remaining
about 20,400 km of the road system constitute the rural/feeder network.
2.    The Association has helped finance four highway projects in Uganda. In addition, it
has helped finance a Railways Project, a Northern Reconstruction Project and a Transport
Rehabilitation Project. The last two projects are under implementation currently.
Project Objectives
3.    The objectives of the project were to: (a) protect capital investment and to increase
the service life of essential roads serving local and transit traffic to other land-locked
countries; (b) help improve maintenance planning and operations of rural/feeder roads
serving agricultural areas; and (c) strengthen institutions responsible for project
implementation (Part I, Para. 1. 1).
4.    After a decade of neglect and ultimate destruction during the liberation war in 1979,
the country's transport system was left in complete disarray; the road network had fallen into
a state of disrepair. The situation was particularly severe for trunk roads serving transit
traffic to other landlocked countries where high volumes and heavy loads had caused
structural damage and made roads difficult and dangerous for traffic (Part I, Para. 2. 1).
5.    The Association helped develop a program for rehabilitation/strengthening of three
high priority trunk roads namely, (i) Kampala - Jinja Road (72 kni); (ii) Mbarara - Rubaare
Road (85 km); and (iii) Mbarara - Ishaka - Katunguru Road (122 km) which had deteriorated
to a point where passage of traffic had become both difficult and dangerous. The project as
part of the larger program consisted of: (i) rehabilitation/ strengthening of the Kampala - Jinja
Road (km 0 - 24) and Mbarara - Ishaka Section (60 km) of the Mbarara - Ishaka - Katunguru
Road, and related supervision; (ii) a pilot rural road maintenance program; (iii) technical
assistance; and (iv) feasibility study and, if feasible, detailed engineering of the Soroti - Lira
Road (Part I, Para. 2.3).
6.    Given the deteriorated state of the country's high priority trunk roads, the complete
lack of maintenance on the rural/feeder roads and the urgent need to alleviate constraints in
the movement, marketing and export of agricultural produce, the project objectives were
clear, realistic and important for the sector, and in line with the Association's Country
Assistance Strategy (Part I, Para. 2.4).

Implementation Experience and Results
7.    The project was scheduled to begin in early 1988 and be completed by June 30, 1993.
Project implementation was the responsibility of Ministry of Works (MOW) and Ministry of
Local Government (MLG). Road rehabilitation/strengthening works were carried out by
contract under the supervision of consultants (Part. 1, Paras. 2.5 and 6).
8.    The rehabilitation/strengthening works on the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) and
Mbarara - Ishaka Road were satisfactorily completed. Some 190 km of rural/feeder road,
compared to the 108 km targeted, was rehabilitated under the pilot rural road maintenance
program (PRRMP); routine maintenance was carried out on some rural/feeder roads with the
help of local contractors. Due to the Government delay in the procurement of road
maintenance and v/orkshop equipment, tools, etc., not much work was done in establishing
road maintenance setups in the three districts chosen under PRRMP. The feasibility study of
the Soroti - Lira Road carried out by consultants showed that upgrading of the road to paved
standards was not economically viable and hence, detailed engineering of the road was
dropped. The technical assistance included in the project helped train a number of freshly
graduated engineers in MOW; the rural road maintenance expert on the technical assistance
team assisted MLG in the preparation and implementation of PRRMP (Part I, Paras. 3.1 and
4.1).
9.    The rehabilitation/strengthening of the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) was
completed in July 1989, with minor delay. However, the works on the Mbarara - Ishaka
Road proceeded slowly, and were completed in February 1991, about eighteen months
behind the contrac1 completion date. Disregarding the Bank procurement procedures, MOW
proposed to award rehabilitation/strengthening works on the Kampala-Jinja Road (Km 0 - 24)
to the second lowest evaluated bidder. In view of the lowest evaluated bidder's refusal to
extend the validity date of his offer, however, the Association agreed to Government
awarding contract to the former. Similarly, MOW proposed to award works on the Mbarara -
Ishaka Road to a firm wrongly declared by consultants to be the lowest evaluated bidder.
Contrary to the Association's advice, it insisted that the consultants' evaluation of the bids
was correct; however, after protacted correspondence between Government and the
Association, MOW finally awarded the contract to the lowest evaluated bidder (Part I, Paras.
6,7 and 17.1).
10.   MLG took long to prepare proposals for road camps, workshops, and road
maintenance and workshop equipment, tools, etc. for PRRMP, despite assistance by the rural
road maintenance expert. It finalized contracts for the supply of road maintenance equipment
in January 1994, some six years after Credit effectiveness. The road maintenance and
workshop equipment, tools, etc. arrived in the country between May and November 1994.
The construction of road camps and small workshops was dropped from the program due to a
change in Government policy to carry out most of the rehabilitation/ maintenance work on
rural/feeder roads by contract in the future (Part I, Paras. 8 and 9).
11.   The total final cost of the project is within the appraisal estimate. The disbursements
under the Credit generally remained ahead of the appraisal estimates, which were



- iv -
conservative. The Credit finally closed on December 31, 1994, within the standard
disbursement profile for Uganda (Part I, Para. I 1).
12.   The project achieved its principal objective of protecting capital investment in the two
very heavily trafficked roads. The pilot rural road maintenance program helped create road
maintenance awareness in the districts, and provided a foundation for the larger feeder road
rehabilitation and maintenance program included in the on-going Transport Rehabilitation
Project. The technical assistance helped train a number of young engineers in MOW, besides
assisting MLG in the preparation/implementation of PRRMP. The project is likely to
maintain the achievements generated. The recalculated ERR for the road rehabilitation/
strengthening works on the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) and Mbarara - Ishaka Road,
representing 85% of the total project cost, is 61% and 17%, compared to an ERR of 63% and
30% respectively, estimated at appraisal. The project outcome is rated as satisfactory (Part I,
Para. 18).
13.   The Association assisted Government in mobilizing donors to finance roads that were
included in the program but did not form part of the project; as an outcome of the
Association's efforts, the rehabilitation/strengthening of section Km 24 - 72 of the Kampala -
Jinja Road, and Ishaka - Katunguru section of the Mbarara - Ishaka - Katunguru Road were
financed by AfDB, and the Mbarara - Rubaare Road by EEC (now EU) (Part 1, Para. 13.1).
14.   The Association's performance during the project cycle was satisfactory (Part I,
Paras. 13.1, 14.5 and 15.1).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
15.   The rehabilitation/strengthening works included in the project were satisfactorily
completed. The PRRMP component of the project suffered long delays in its
implementation; not much work was done in establishing road maintenance setups in the
chosen districts. The road maintenance and workshop equipment, tools, etc. procured under
the program will be utilized for contractor training in rural/feeder rehabilitation/ maintenance
under the ongoing Transport Rehabilitation Project. Government was in general compliance
with the Credit covenants; however, the audit reports were generally received very late.
Also, the funds allocated/released for road maintenance were generally far below the
requirement (Part 1, Paras. 3.1 and 17.3).
16.   The key lessons learned are that: (a) a mid-term review of project implementation, as
now generally practiced, and closer supervision would bring to light any inaction on the part
of the borrower/implementing agency(ies)/consultants; (b) the terms of reference of technical
assistance staff should include a detailed work program with verifiable inputs and outputs for
each individual staff; and (c) an appropriate funding mechanism and tight administration of
project conditionality need to be established to assure availability of adequate funds for road
maintenance in a timely manner (Part I, Paras. 20, 21 and 22).



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1803-UG)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    Objectives
1.1   The project objectives were to:
(a)   protect capital investment and to increase the service life of essential roads
serving local and transit traffic to other land-locked countries;
(b)   help improve maintenance planning and operations of rural/feeder roads
serving agricultural areas; and
(c)   strengthen institutions responsible for project implementation.
2.    Evaluation of Objectives
2.1    After a decade of neglect and ultimate destruction during the liberation war in
1979, the country's transport system was left in complete disarray; the road network had
fallen into a state of disrepair. Due to the lack of proper maintenance, the paved roads
had developed deep potholes and surface cracks besides extensive edge raveling, and in
the worst cases they required major rehabilitation/strengthening. Most gravel roads had
completely lost their gravel and had reverted to earth roads. The situation was
particularly severe for trunk roads serving transit traffic to other landlocked countries
(Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire) where high volumes and heavy loads had caused
structural damage and made roads difficult and dangerous for traffic.
2.2   The Government's objectives for the transport sector were to alleviate constraints
in the movement, marketing and export of agricultural produce and to ensure that basic
transport services were available in the country by (a) restoration of trunk roads, and in
particular the main transit routes; (b) rehabilitation of Government's road maintenance
capacity; and (c) rehabilitation of the railways. The Association's Country Assistance



- 2 -
Strategy in support of Government's efforts was to (i) help prevent further deterioration of
the country's road network by strengthening Government's road maintenance capacity
(Third Highway Project, Cr. 1445-UG); (ii) rehabilitate roads of key economic
importance (The Project); and (iii) support rehabilitation of the railway (Cr. 1986-UG).
2.3   Following engineering investigations carried out with financing from Technical
Assistance Credit 1 077-UG, the Association helped develop a program for
rehabilitation/strengthening of three high priority trunk roads namely, (i) Kampala -
Jinja Road (72 km); (ii) Mbarara - Rubaare Road (85 km); and (iii) Mbarara - Ishaka -
Katunguru Road (122 km) which were heavily trafficked and had deteriorated to a point
where passage of traffic had become both difficult and dangerous. The project as part
of the larger program consisted of: (i) rehabilitation/strengtlhening of the Kampala - Jinja
Road (km 0 - 24) and Mbarara - Ishaka Section (60 kim) of the Mbarara - Ishaka -
Katunguru Road, and related supervision; (ii) a pilot rural road maintenance program;
(iii) technical assistance; and (iv) feasibility study and, if feasible, detailed engineering of
the Soroti - Lira Road.
2.4    Given the deteriorated state of the country's high priority trunk roads, the
complete lack of maintenance on the rural/feeder roads and the urgent need to alleviate
constraints in the movement, marketing and export of agricultural produce. the project
objectives were clear, realistic and important for the sector, and in line with the
Association's Country Assistance Strategy.
2.5   The project was relatively simple and its concept and design appropriate. Project
implementation v.- s the responsibility of Ministry of Works (MOW) and Ministry of
Local Governmen.t (MLG). Road rehabilitation/ strengthening works were carried out by
contract under the supervision of consultants.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
3.    Physical Objectives
3.1    The rehabilitation/strengthening works on the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24)
and Mbarara - Ishaka Road were satisfactorily completed. Some 190 km of rural/feeder
road, compared to the 108 km targeted, was rehabilitated under the pilot rural road
maintenance program (PRRMP); routine maintenance was carried out on some
rural/feeder roads with the help of local contractors. Due to the Government delay in the
procurement of road maintenance and workshop equipment, tools, etc. (Para. 9), not
much work was done in establishing road maintenance setups in the three districts
(Mbale, Kapchorwa, Tororo) chosen under PRRMP. The feasibility study of the Soroti -
Lira Road was completed. The results of the study showed that upgrading of the road to
paved standards was not economically viable and hence, detailed engineering of the road
was dropped -- the road is included for rehabilitation/ regravelling under the Northern
Reconstruction Project (Cr. 2362-UG). The achievement of physical objectives was
substantial.



4.    Institutional Development Objectives
4.1   The technical assistance included in the project helped train a number of freshly
graduated engineers in MOW in road survey and design, besides assisting MOW in the
preparation of draft road design manual, tender documents and specifications for road and
bridge works. The rural road maintenance expert on the technical assistance team
assisted MLG in the preparation and implementation of PRRMP. The achievement of the
institutional development objectives was, however, partial.
5.    Economic Re-evaluation
5.1   The recalculated ERR for the road rehabilitation/strengthening works on the
Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) and Mbarara - Ishaka Road, representing 85% of the
total project cost, is 61% and 17%, compared to an ERR of 63% and 30% respectively,
estimated at appraisal. A lower than the estimated ERR in the case of the Mbarara-Ishaka
Road is due to the lower than expected traffic volume on the road.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
6.    The project was scheduled to begin in early 1988 and be completed by June 30,
1993. The rehabilitation/strengthening of the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) was
completed in July 1989, with minor delay. With regard to the Mbarara - Ishaka Road,
Government invit Ed bids for the works in November 1986 with deadline for the
submission of bids as February 13, 1987. Consultants' evaluation of the bids showed a
UK construction f-rm to be the lowest evaluated bidder and MOW agreeing with the
consultants' evaluation recommended award to this firm. A review by the Association of
the consultants' evaluation report, however, showed that the consultants had attempted to
erode the difference in bid prices by admitting a discount offer by the firm found three
days after the public bid opening and by misinterpreting certain provisions of the bidding
documents. The firm's letter offering discount had the date "23rd February, 1987", while
the closing date of the bids was February 13, 1987; and the same was neither stamped nor
endorsed by the Government Central Tender Board, unlike other discount offers.
Furthermore, the firm's bid cover letter made no reference, whatsoever, to any discount
offer, nor was it read out at the public bid opening. Contrary to the Association's advice,
MOW insisted that the consultants' interpretation of the bidding documents was correct
and that the discount offer in question was genuine. After protracted correspondence
between Governr ent and the Association, MOW proposed and the Association agreed to
Government negotiating a contract with the lowest evaluated bidder (Hungary); a contract
between Government and the contractor was signed on February 15, 1988, one year after
the bid opening. (At a meeting between the Association and consultants senior
management, in March 1988, the consultants admitted, and later confirmed it in writing
that they had made mistakes in bid evaluation, and promised to improve their internal
quality control).



-4-
7.    The commencement date of the said contract was set as March 1, 1988, with
completion by August 28, 1989. The construction works on the road proceeded slowly --
as of May 1989, the overall physical progress of the works was about 5%, while some
80% of the contract period had elapsed. In July 1989, MOW served the contractor with a
notice of expulsion from site and of its intention to take over his construction plant,
temporary works and materials for use in completing the works. But, later it allowed the
contractor to continue by subcontracting parts of the work to two locally available
international contractors, one Chinese and the other UK national. In July 1990, the
contractor entrusted certain additional works to the Chinese sub-contractor, and also
subcontracted the supply of stone aggregate to a local supplier. The works on the road
were finally completed in February 1991, about eighteen months behind the contract
completion date.
8.    The Development Credit Agreement (Schedule 4, Para. 3), required MLG to
prepare, with the assistance of a rural road maintenance engineer, a rural road
maintenance program for the Association's review, prior to its implementation. It was not
until October 1990 that MLG submitted an initial road maintenance program to the
Association, followed by proposals for road camps and workshops in September 1992.
However later, in July 1993, MLG proposed construction of feeder road offices and
storage facilities, in lieu of the road camps and small workshops envisaged in the
program, since the latter were no longer found to be necessary, in view of the
Governrment policy to carry out most of the rehabilitation/maintenance work on
rural/feeder roads by contract in the future. The construction of road camps and
workshops was, therefore, dropped from PRRMP.
9.    A review by the Association of the final bidding documents for the supply of road
maintenance equipment issued to the suppliers by MLG showed that: (i) the same did not
fully incorporate the Association's comments on a series of earlier drafts; (ii) the time
allowed (24 days) for the preparation and submission of bids was inadequate; and (iii) the
bid evaluation did not follow the criteria specified in the bidding documents. In
December 1992, MLG invited fresh bids for the equipment after canceling contracts
which it had already signed with the suppliers, and finally signed fresh contracts with the
suppliers in January 1994, some six years after Credit effectiveness. Similarly, it took
MLG long to finalize contracts for the supply of workshop equipment, tools, etc. for
PRRMP. The road maintenance and workshop equipment, tools, etc. arrived in the
country between May and November 1994.
10.   Government retained consultants to provide technical assistance services to MOW
and MLG; a contract between MOW and the firm was signed on May 2, 1989, with
completion by December 18, 1991. The consultants team leader and a road design
engineer arrived in the country in June 1989, while the remaining two staff (a road design
engineer and a rural road maintenance engineer) in August/September 1989. Due to the
late arrival of some of the staff, the TA contract was extended by six months to June 18,
1992 -- the services of a road design engineer were retained for another six months. The



- 5 -
consultanits failed to find a replacement for one of the road design engineers who resigned
and left the count-y in June 1991. The consultants progress reports mostly dwelt on the
achievement of technical assistance team objectives rather than showing specific tasks
performed by individual staff.
11.   The total final cost of the project is within the appraisal estimate (Part II, Table 7);
however, a small excess occurred over the cost of construction supervision due to the
delay caused in the completion of works on the Mbarara - Ishaka Road which was offset
by savings on other items. The disbursements under the Credit (Part II, Table 4)
generally remained ahead of the appraisal estimates, which were conservative. The
Credit finally closed on December 31, 1994, within the standard disbursement profile for
Uganda.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
12.   Ihe road rehabilitation/strengthening works which consisted of pavement
strengthening/reconstruction, widening/reconstruction of shoulders and improvement of
roadside drains were designed for a service life of fifteen years, and were satisfactorily
completed. The technical assistance helped train a number of freshly graduated
engineers in MOW, besides assisting MLG in the preparation/implementation of
PRRMP. The experience gained under PRRMP was applied in designing the ongoing
Transport Rehabilitation Project which will help improve road maintenance planning
and operations. The project is likely to maintain the achievements generated.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
13.   Project Identification/Preparation
13.1  The project was identified, prepared and appraised at a time when the country's
transport system was in complete disarray. The Association helped develop a program
for the rehabilitation/strengthening of the country's three high priority trunk roads
(Para. 2.3). It also assisted Government in mobilizing donors to finance roads that
were included in the program but did not form part of the project; as an outcome of the
Association's efforts, the rehabilitation/strengthening of the Kampala - Jinja Road (km
24 - 72) and Ishaka - Katunguru section of the Mbarara - Ishaka - Katunguru Road
were financed by the AfDB, and the Mbarara - Rubaare Road by EEC (now EU). The
Association's performance in project identification, as well as project preparation
assistance was highly satisfactory.



-6-
14.   Project Appraisal
14.1  The project was appraised in May 1985. However, in view of the unstable
political situation in the country at the time, it was decided to defer presentation of the
project to the Loan Committee. Following formation of a new Government, the
appraisal mission returned to Uganda in June/July 1986 to seek Government agreement
with the project scope and content, and to update the appraisal.
14.2 To alleviate the impact of understaffing in MOW, road construction was
planned to be carried out by contract under the supervision of consultants; technical
assistance was included to help improve MOW's capacity in highway planning and
design, and to provide assistance to MLG in the preparation and implementation of
PRRMP. The project required Government to fill two key vacant positions (a chief
planning engineel and a chief road maintenance engineer) in MOW with suitably
qualified and experienced persons by a specified date (October 31, 1987). The risk
that project implementation might be delayed due to MOW/MLG's lack of
administrative capacity was thus minimized.
14.3  To avoid any unforeseen increases in cost, bids for road rehabilitation/
strengthening works were received prior to Board presentation. To ensure allocation of
adequate funds for maintenance of the main road network, it was agreed that
Government would review with the Association the budgetary requirements and the
proposed budgetary allocation for road maintenance over the period FY 1988 - 93, and
would ensure that any shortfall in the allocation of funds during the past year is made
up as appropriate in the subsequent year.
14.4  The implementation schedule and project monitoring indices agreed with
Government were adequate.
14.5  The Association's performance in project appraisal is rated as satisfactory.
15.   Project Supervision
15.1  The Association's supervision effort was more than adequate, with thirteen
missions fielded over seven years; however, there was lack of continuity in project
supervision during FY89 and FY90 due to a change in the task management
responsibility. The project implementation progress reporting was adequate and the
performance ratir given in Supervision Form 590s appropriate; the implementation
problems were correctly identified and appropriate and timely advice given to the
implementing agencies. The Association spent a great deal of time and effort in
assisting MOW/MLG in the procurement of civil works and goods contracts. It did
not, however, push MLG early enough to pay attention to establishing road
maintenance setups in the districts, instead of its focusing attention on road
rehabilitation. The Bank's supervision performance was generally satisfactory.

F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
16.   Project Preparation
16.1  The borrower helped expedite engineering studies for the roads included in the
program and the receipt of bids for road rehabilitation/strengthening works prior to
Board presentation. The borrower performance in project preparation was satisfactory.
17.   Project Implementation
17.1  Project coordination in MOW was weak until a new Deputy Engineer-in-Chief
(Development) assumed charge of the post in November 1990 -- prior to this, the
highway engineer (project coordinator) on the technical assistance team acted as deputy
engineer-in-chief. Disregaruing the Bank procurement procedures, MOW proposed to
award rehabilitation/strengthening works on the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) to
the second lowest evaluated bidder on the grounds that the lowest evaluated bid was
significantly lower than the consultants estimate of cost and that the bidder, a
prequalified contractor, did not have an established organization in Uganda, nor did he
have previous experience on similar works in the country. In view of the latter's
refusal to extend the validity date of his offer, however, the Association agreed to
Government awarding contract to the second lowest evaluated bidder. Similarly,
MOW proposed to award rehabilitation/strengthening works on the Mbarara - Ishaka
Road to a firm wrongly declared to be the lowest evaluated bidder. Contrary to the
Association's advice, it insisted that the consultants' evaluation of the bids was correct;
however, after protracted correspondence between Government and the Association,
MOW finally awarded the contract to the lowest evaluated bidder (Para. 6).
17.2 Despite assistance by a rural road maintenance expert, MLG took long to
prepare proposals for setting up road camps and workshops and to finalize contracts for
the supply of road maintenance and workshop equipment, tools, etc. for PRRMP
(Paras. 8 and 9).
17.3  Government was in general compliance with the Credit covenants; however, the
audit reports were generally received very late -- the audit reports for FY88 - FY91
were received in July 1992, after several reminders. Also, the funds allocated/released
for road maintenance were generally far below the requirement.
17.4 The borrower performance in procurement procedures for civil works and
goods contracts, and covenant compliance was deficient.



-8-
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
18.   The project achieved its principal objective of protecting capital investment in
the two very heavily trafficked roads. The pilot rural road maintenance program
helped create road maintenance awareness in the districts and provided a foundation for
the larger feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance program included in the ongoing
Transport Rehabilitation Project. The technical assistance helped train a number of
young engineers in MOW, among other things. The recalculated ERR for the road
rehabilitation/strengthening works on the Kampala - Jinja Road (km 0 - 24) and
Mbarara - Ishaka Road, representing 85% of the total project cost, is 61% and 17%,
compared to an ERR of 63% and 30% respectively, estimated at appraisal (Para. 5.1).
The project outcome is rated as satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
19.   The road maintenance and workshop equipment procured under PRRMP will be
utilized for contractor training in rural/feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance
under the ongoing Transport Rehabilitation Project which will help improve road
maintenance planning and operations. Apart from allocating agreed levels of
counterpart funds, the project requires Government to introduce an effective financing
mechanism for road maintenance by a specified date.
l. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
20.   The pilot rural road maintenance program component of the project suffered
long delays in its implementation. A mid-term review of project implementation, as
now generally practiced, and closer supervision would have brought to light the
inaction on the part of the borrower/implementing agency(ies)/consultants.
21.   The progress reports on technical assistance services provided by consultants
did not show specific tasks performed by individual staff. The terms of reference of
technical assistance staff should include a detailed work program with verifiable inputs
and outputs for each individual staff.
22.   The funds allocated/released by Government for road maintenance were
generally inadequate. This underlines the need for establishing a funding mechanism
and tight administration of project conditionality that would assure the availability of
adequate funds for road maintenance in a timely manner.

1.0   INTRODUCTION
The Fourth Highway Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Uganda and International Development Association (IDA) was signed on 29th
May, 1987. The Credit No. 1803-UG equivalent to 14.1 million Special Drawing
Rights (SDit), became effective on the I Ith September, 1987 and expired on 31st
December, 1994. The Fourth Highway Project included the following parts:-
Pait A: Highway Rehabilitation and Strengthening
Part B: Rural Roads Maintenance
Part C: Technical Assistance to M.O.W.T&C and M.O.L.G.
Part D: Studies
2.1 PART A: HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND STRENGTHENING
(a)   The Rehabilitation and Strengthening of Kampala - Jinja road went on as
plav!:.ed except for only 2 1/2 months delay in completion. The project
was executed to the desired quality standard.
(b)   The Rehabilitation and Strengthening of Mbarara - Ishaka road suffered
significant delays right from the start because of the Contractor's failure to
execute work in accordance with the project programme. As a result of
these delays by the Contractor, the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications saw it imperative to re-negotiate the Contract
amendment with the Contractor whereby the Contractor had to subcontract
some of the works to two Contractors. The project was completed to the
desired standards 18 months later than the scheduled date of completion.
2.2   PART B: RURAL FEEDER ROADS
The procurement of Civil Works Component was cancelled but procurement of
Road Maintenance equipment and workshop tools effected. This was because the
feeder roads that were scheduled to be maintained were in such a state of disrepair
that they needed complete rehabilitation rather than maintenance. Some of the
procured items have been received by the Client, others are still with the clearing
agencies.

2.3   PART C: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO M.O.W.T&C AND M.O.L.G.
These tasks were successfully undertaken by a team of Consultants. This team
dealt with Project Coordination and preparation of 5-year Road Improvements
plan (1992 - 1997), Improvement of Design Office capabilities and training of
M.O.W.T & C staff in Project Implementation. The technical assistance team
also prepared a Road Design Manual and Specifications for Roads and Bridges
Construction. The technical assistance also covered Project Monitoring and
technical assistance to Ministry of Local Government. The consultant Roughton
and Partners provided a Road Maintenance Engineer to the Ministry of Local
Government. This consultant prepared a Rural Road Maintenance program for
the M.O.L.G. Because of the poor conditions of the roads the consultant assisted
in putting the roads in a maintenable condition. The Consultant also assisted in
implementation of the Rural Road Maintenance Programme.
2.4   PART D: STUDIES
Techno-ecoiiomic Feasibility Studies were carried out by Consultants Norconsult
on Soroti - Lira Road.
2.5   BORROVERS OWN PERFORMANCE
2.5.1  The Borrower opened up a special dollar account for the credit with the Bank of
Baroda and also paid all the fees and service rates as agreed. The borrowers Bank
Account were properly and smoothly operated.
2.5.2  The Borrower also kept good accounting records including auditing, for the credit
transactions and ensured to have adequate budgetary allocations for the road
network administered by the Ministry, especially for the roads supported by the
Bank.
2.5.3  The Borrk,%ver fulfilled all the agreements and conditions preferred by the Bank
and particularly filled in vacant post of Chief Planning Engineer and Chief Road
Maintenance Engineer by October 31, 1987.
2.6   PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
2.6.1  The Bank's performance was generally excellent. The Bank made all its
payments in time. The Bank also maintained a very good contact with the
Borrower by periodically sending in supervision Missions to take stock of project
progress and give advice on actions to be undertaken and advise on future actions.
2.6.2 The Bank lhas been very cooperative especially as the Borrower is still building up
enough cap.icity to handle its operations.

2.7   LESSONS LEARNED
2.7.1  Some delays were experienced in the implementation due to late payments of
local funds to Contractors from the Ministry of Finance. To alleviate these
problems it is recommended that a Road Fund for Road Maintenance be set up to
enable timely disbursement of local funds to Contractors.
2.7.2 It was also learned that contracting most of the maintenance jobs to private
contractors was more cost effective. As such the Ministry now contracts most of
its Road Maintenance Operations.
