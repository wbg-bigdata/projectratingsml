MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Impact Evaluation Report on Pakistan:
SCARP Transition Pilot Project (Credit 1693-PAK)
Attached is an impact evaluation report (IER) on the SCARP Transition Pilot Project (Credit
1693-PAK) in Pakistan. The credit of US$10 million was approved in FY86 and closed in FY92. The
evaluation is based primarily on the findings of a series of surveys, some commissioned by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), carried out by the Punjab Economic Research Institute (PERI) from 1989 to
1995 that focus on the project's impact on beneficiaries and the environment. It is also based on a review
of Bank files, including project completion and audit reports, field visits to the project site, and
interviews with beneficiaries and Government and Bank staff. OED's evaluation team made three visits
to Pakistan and discussed the pilot project with farmers, central and provincial government officials, PERI,
researchers from the International rrigation Management and International Waterlogging and Salinity
Research Institutes, and representatives from nongovernmental organizations.
The Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPs) were initiated in the 1960s to address
Pakistan's drainage problem and to supplement irregular supplies of canal water. The SCARP projects are
part of a long struggle to dea'l with the twin problems of waterlogging and salinity that are the side effects of
this semi-arid country's heavy dependence on irrigation. For two decades, the SCARP public wells did their
job well. However, increasingly problematic operation and maintenance and rapidly rising costs made the
SCARP wells an unsustainable financial burden on the government.
The SCARP Transition Pilot project was designed to alleviate these problems in fresh groundwater
areas by transferring responsi'bility for drainage and irrigation from the public to the private sector. The
project's objectives centered. around decommissioning 213 public SCARP wells and replacing them with
2,100 private wells, providing electrical supplies for private well operation and improvements to minor
irrigation canals. The projecl covered about 46,000 ha of irrigated land and about 11,500 farm families in
north-central Punjab Province. Fifty percent of project cost was for electrification. Actual project
expenditures were only 68 percent of appraisal estimates primarily because private wells were installed
at only a third of the estimated cost and electrical power load management was canceled. Even so,
installed private well capacity exceeded irrigation requirements.
The evaluation estimated the ERR for the pilot at 18 percent compared to an appraisal estimate
of 23 percent. While there were substantial investrnent savings, the ERR is primarily a reflection of the
savings to government from shutting down public wells. Net agricultural productive gains due to the
project were small because private wells were installed independently of the pilot. Well ownership inthe
pilot area increased from 52 percent of farms in 1989 to 82 percent in 1994. The effects of the project on

equity were not negative, as had been anticipated, but mildly positive. Benefits were relatively well
distributed because of the market that developed for private well water. Although project actions to
foster group ownership of wells were ineffective, water buyers were able to achieve substantially the
same farming results as well owners.
The outcome of the project is satisfactory. The project's ambitious institutional objectives were
fully achieved. Responsibility for groundwater-based irrigation and vertical drainage was successfully
transferred to the private sector without the angry demonstrations that had been anticipated. Despite
having to absorb irrigation and drainage costs, farmers were able to increase their productivity enough to
come out ahead. The impact evaluation rates the project's sustainability as likely. With increased
groundwater irrigation, secondary soil salinity increased, but farmers were able to keep it to
agronomically acceptable levels. While the water table has thus far remained stable, there is no guarantee
that this result can be maintained with thousands of farmers operating pumps independently. Great care
has to be taken in selecting appropriate regulatory instruments and the evaluation suggests that
differential water pricing may be the least harmful.
The main lesson from this pilot project is that Pakistan and the Bank lost an early opportunity to
save significant operations and maintenance expenditures because they hung onto the public sector
SCARP model for too long. From inception of the idea for a transition project in 1980, it took more than
a decade to prove it would work. In preparing the follow-on Privatization of Groundwater Development
project, both the Bank and the borrower are mindful of the lessons of the SCARP Transition Pilot project
and of its on-going sequel, the Second SCARP Transition project. General subsidies for private well
investment have been eliminated as unnecessary, as have electricity subsidies, which skew the choice
among diesel, electric, and tractor-powered pumping (most farmers opt for diesel). The new project is
expected to focus its promotional efforts exclusively on community-owned wells rather than a large
number of underutilized individually owned wells, because the community wells will provide the
greatest social benefits.

Preface
The Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPs) were initiated in the 1960s to
address Pakistan's ongoing drainage problem and to supplement often irregular supplies of canal
water. The SCARP projects were part of a decades-long struggle to deal with the twin problems
of waterlogging and salinity that are the side effects of this semi-arid country's heavy
dependence on irrigation. For two decades, the SCARP public tubewells did their job well, but in
the 1 980s they began to fail because of increasingly problematic operation and maintenance.
Pumping declined significantly, and rapidly rising costs made the SCARP tubewells an
unsustainable financial burden on the government.
The SCARP Transition Pilot project was designed to alleviate these problems by
transferring responsibility for drainage and irrigation to the farmers themselves. Farmers in fresh
groundwater areas had already begun installing their own shallow tubewells to improve irregular
water supplies. The pilot provided assistance (including electrical hookups) to farmers in order to
encourage the construction of private tubewells. It also aimed to address the issues that arose
naturally from the project's central objective of shifting a public sector burden to the private
sector: cost-effectiveness, equity, sustainability (including operation and maintenance), and
potential agricultural and environmental impacts.
This Impact Evaluation Report is based primarily on a series of surveys carried out by
the Punjab Economic Research Institute (PERI) from 1989 to 1995 that focus on the project's
impact on beneficiaries and the environment. PERI questioned farmers within the project area
and a control group of-nonproject farmers, revisiting the same samples each time (the control
group was changed slightly to more accurately reflect the nonproject area). Three Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) missions to Pakistan in the period 1993-96 also held discussions
about the pilot project with farmers, central and provincial government officials, researchers
from the International Irrigation Management and International Waterlogging and Salinity
Research Institutes, and representatives from nongovernmental organizations. The final mission
produced an extensive draft report that drew on earlier OED reports and documents. This impact
evaluation, which is based on the report, addresses the major issues raised by the SCARP
transition concept.
Copies of the draft Impact Evaluation Report were sent to the borrower and its executing
agencies for comments, and these are attached in Annex B. Where appropriate the text has been
changed to reflect these comments.

Executive Summary
1.    Pakistan depends heavily on irrigation. Its irrigation system, which dates from the
nineteenth century, is one of the largest contiguous systems in the world. Despite the extensive
irrigation, however, the country faces two ongoing problems-salinity and waterlogging-that
have come to be known as Pakistan's "twin menaces." Annually, they reduce production on
millions of hectares of farmland, put large tracts out of production altogether, and jeopardize the
system's integrity.
2.    The problem of salinity is all the more serious because the groundwater in the Indus
basin is saline except where the fresh water of the Indus and its tributaries has refreshed it over
the millennia. Furthermore, the irrigated area is extremely flat and, without proper drainage,
prone to waterlogging. The problem of adding irrigation water to groundwater is accentuated
when the irrigation water supply must be increased to leach salts or when farmers overirrigate to
compensate for an unreliable system (or in response to artificially cheap irrigation water).
3.    Attacking the twin menace is a massive undertaking, and the IDA's assistance is only a
small part of the effort. 'The IDA has made 27 irrigation loans or credits to Pakistan for a total of
US$1,305 million. Nine of these, or US$457 million, were principally for drainage to control
salinization and waterlogging. Nevertheless, the problem is far from solved, and Pakistan
continues to lose almost as much irrigated land each year as it gains from investments.
4.     There are three potential solutions to this problem. The traditional vertical approach,
dating from 1958, uses a network of large, deep public tubewells to lower the water table.
Where the groundwater thus pumped is suitably fresh, it is used for irrigation and household
purposes. Where it is saline, it is dumped into rivers or evaporation ponds. Where it is brackish,
it is mixed with fresher surface water and used for irrigation. This approach was embodied in
Pakistan's Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPs), which were financed with local
resources and a variety of external financing, including IDA funds.
5.    The second approach-horizontal drainage-was piloted by an IDA-financed project
(Khairpur Tile Drain, Credit 648, approved FY76) and promoted by two more (SCARP Mardan,
Credit 877, approved FY79; and Fourth Drainage, Credit 1375, approved FY83). Although this
approach generally uses open drains, the flat Indus basin requires subsurface tile drains. The
investment cost of tile drainage is roughly three times that of its vertical competitors, but its
operating costs are much. lower, as are the volume and salinity of the effluent pumped.
6.    The SCARP Transition Pilot Project represents the third approach. It was supported by
an IDA credit for SDR 8.7 million (US$10 million). Although the vertical SCARP tubewells
had been highly successiful at lowering the water table and reducing soil salinity, they were an
unsustainable burden on the government's budget. The costs of operating and maintaining the
wells were substantial, and the government did not recoup these expenditures from the farmers.
Service grew progressively worse as the tubewells began to deteriorate and power supplies grew
less and less reliable. The transition pilot was designed to resolve these problems by eliminating
public tubewells in areas with plentiful fresh groundwater and enabling farmers to construct their
own tubewells.



12
Objectives
7.     The transition to private wells would relieve the government of the substantial burden of
subsidizing well water and providing vertical drainage, instead transferring these costs to
farmers. This shift in water delivery would ultimately improve the reliability of the water
supply. With more reliable irrigation, farmers would be able to increase production of wheat,
paddy, and vegetables, raising household incomes.
8.     While the IDA's President's Report stresses the project's potential productivity gains
and fiscal savings, a review of IDA files shows that equity was also a major concern.I Private
tubewell investment was already proceeding rapidly on its own. In subsidizing tubewell
construction, the project, it was hoped, would reduce the possibility that control of the water
supply would fall into the hands of the richest farmers. Thus, the project's objectives also
included institution building among smallholders in an effort to encourage farmer groups that
would own and maintain tubewells.
Implementation Experience
9.     The implementation problems that seemed so significant at the time of the Project
Completion Report (PCR) do not seem as important at impact evaluation. Most significantly, the
SCARP public tubewells were shut down without the major protests many had feared. Project
costs were far lower than anticipated, and half the credit was canceled. Since many more
farmers than anticipated opted for diesel pumps, the electric grid that was installed to facilitate
private electric pumping was not used as extensively as anticipated.
Results
10.    The PCR and audit of the SCARP Transition Pilot expressed considerable doubt about
the extent and equity of the project's actual productivity gains. To address these doubts, the
Punjab Economic Research Institute (PERI) was commissioned to repeat its 1989 benchmark and
1990 farm-management and technical studies. The results show distinct changes between 1989
and 1994, not only on project farms but among a control group of farms outside the project area.
11.    SCARP public tubewells were shut down in the project area but not in the control area.
Well ownership in the project area rose from 58 percent of farms in 1989 to 82 percent in 1994,
but well ownership rose even more (though from a lower base) in the control area. In both areas,
individual ownership increased more than group ownership, and large farmers continued to be
more likely to own wells than smaller farmers. Well owners' operational holdings in 1994
averaged 4.4 ha, compared with 1.7 ha for nonowners who bought water from them and 1.0 ha
for the 3 percent of farmers who did not use tubewell water. Between 1989 and 1994, pump
capacity utilization fell from 13 to 7 percent in the project area and from 8 to 5 percent in the
control area, but capacity utilization by larger farmers was more than three times that of smaller
farmers.
1. A Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was not prepared, and the Report and Recommendations of the President to the
Executive Directors (the "President's Report") summarizes the justification for the project.

12.   The water table dropped modestly to within the desirable range. Water quality
improved. With increased groundwater irrigation, secondary soil salinity increased, but farmers
were able to keep it to agronomically acceptable levels. And despite having to absorb irrigation
and drainage costs, farmers were able to increase their productivity enough to come out ahead:
average net farm income per hectare increased 16 percent in the project area and 12 percent in
the control area.
13.    The 1994 survey found few differences in tubewell ownership, access to tubewell water,
and productivity between the project area and the control area (where some farmers still had
access to SCARP public tubewell services). For this reason, the stream of on-farm benefits
stemming from the project, whether economic or financial, was negligible. The economic rate of
return (ERR) to the resources engaged in the project was 18 percent, down from the appraisal
estimate of 23 percent arnd the PCR estimate of 32 percent. This ERR reflects primarily the
savings to the government from shutting down public tubewells-savings that far exceeded the
costs of building, operating and maintaining the private tubewells. The SCARP Transition Pilot,
then, was not only a successful pilot but a satisfactory investment.
14.    Private tubewell development occurred at the same rate in the project and control areas.
Whenever possible, farmrers in both areas used canal irrigation for their base capacity and private
pumping for peak capacity. The financial rate of return to private wells in this scenario was
about 24 percent (for electric) and 46 percent (for diesel). The insignificant differences between
net on-farm benefits per hectare between project farmers and farmers in the control group
suggest that the wells were a good investment with or without a transition pilot.
15.    The project's amnbitious institutional objectives were fully achieved. Responsibility for
groundwater-based irrigation and vertical drainage was successfully transferred to the private
sector. The government's public tubewell service was dismantled in the project area without the
angry demonstrations that had been anticipated.
16.    The impact evaluation rates the project's sustainability as likely. Nevertheless, the
findings raise new problems regarding sustainability. First, while farmers appeared to be
managing the salt buildup satisfactorily, soil salinity is part of a widespread problem that shallow
tubewells cannot solve (and may actually make worse). Second, while the water table has thus
far remained stable, there is no guarantee that this result can be maintained with thousands of
farmers operating pumps independently, without coordination or planning.
17.    The effects of the project on equity were not negative, as had been anticipated, but
mildly positive. Although project provisions to foster group ownership were ineffective and
ownership was more comamon among large farmers than among smallholders, benefits were
relatively well distributed because of the market that developed for private tubewell water.
Water buyers without their own wells were able to achieve substantially the same farming results
as well owners, for two reasons. First, small farmers have been unable to utilize their tubewells
to full capacity. Second, the large number of wells has resulted in excess pumping capacity for
the area, lowering water prices. As a result, small farmers who own tubewells have had poor
returns on their investme nts. The situation has been a good one for water buyers but not for
tubewell-owning smallholders.



14
Findings and Issues
18.   In areas with plenty of fresh groundwater, the transition from public to private tubewells
has been socially worthwhile for Pakistan, fiscally worthwhile for Pakistan's governments, and
financially worthwhile for farmers. But farmers in these areas tend to build pnlvate wells even in
the absence of extra incentives. Therefore, a lower-cost solution than providing a transition
project would be simply to close the public tubewells in these areas-what the Punjab Irrigation
Department called the "do-nothing mode."
19.    Simply doing nothing may not be enough, however, for several reasons. First, at present
pumping intensities, salt buildup will ultimately contaminate the aquifer, making it unusable.
Second, in the long term the water table will fall if pumping at current levels continues. Third,
unplanned tubewell installation leads to overinvestment and low rates of capacity utilization for
everybody, especially for those well owners with the smallest plots. Capacity utilization for
farmers operating less than 2 ha, for instance, cannot easily be raised from the current 4 percent
to the 13 percent of farmers operating more than 10 ha.
20.    Group ownership promotes greater capacity utilization (and thus equity) among the
smallest well owners-about one-third higher, according to the impact survey. Mindful of the
transition pilot's failures in promoting group ownership, however, Pakistan's follow-on
Privatization of Groundwater Development project is expected to focus its promotional efforts
exclusively on community-owned tubewells, an effort that would break new ground in Pakistan,
although it has parallels in India. Successful projects there share several characteristics: (a)
identification and fostering of community groups; (b) public construction or rehabilitation of
groundwater systems to high standards; and (c) community ownership and operation of the
systems. While rehabilitation of SCARP tubewells is not a viable alternative, similar
community-based measures are being proposed for Pakistan-an optimistic out]Look for the
future of the country's essential irrigation system.

1.  Introduction
1.1    Irrigation is the lifeblood of Pakistan's agricultural economy. Without the Indus river
and its abundant waters, most of this arid and semi-arid country could not be farmed. Irrigated
land supplies almost 90 percent of agricultural production, accounting for 26 percent of GDP and
providing employment for 54 percent of the labor force. The importance of irrigation to
agriculture lies at the heart of the debate about the merits of Pakistan's Salinity Control and
Reclamation Project (SCARP), of which the Transition Pilot was a part. SCARP provided
Pakistan's farmers with heavily subsidized water from large public tubewells. The SCARP
Transition Pilot aimed to test the effectiveness of replacing publicly provided irrigation with
incentives to invest in small private wells. This report looks in detail at the project, its effects on
agricultural production, and its impact on the producers themselves.
Background
1.2    For centuries the Indus River has been developed to meet Pakistan's expanding irrigation
requirements. The Indus Basin irrigation system is now the world's largest: it commands 14
million hectares, distributing water through a network made up of more than 1.6 million km of
canals, watercourses, and ditches. While this extensive development has dramatically increased
agricultural production, the gains have not been without cost. Adequate drainage facilities were
not provided, resulting in seepage losses (possibly as much as 40 percent of the water supply)
from irrigation canals, watercourses, and deep percolation from irrigated lands. These seepage
losses have in turn caused water tables to rise and created waterlogging and salinity, with a
measurable effect on crop production. Estimates of the irrigated areas affected by waterlogging
vary from 1.6 to 3.0 million ha, and of "salt-affected" areas from 2.2 to 4.6 million ha-up to 26
percent of irrigated land (Mian and Mirza 1993; Sandhu 1993).
1.3    Farmers and both central and provincial governments, sometimes supported by
international financiers, have been addressing the drainage problem for decades. The IDA's
efforts are only a small part of the whole, although the agency has made 27 irrigation loans and
credits to Pakistan for a total of US$1,305 million (annex 1). Nine of these, for US$457 million,
were principally for drainage to control waterlogging and salinization. But despite the ongoing
efforts, the problem is far from solved. In value terms, Pakistan loses almost as much irrigated
land each year as it gains from investments.
The Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP)
1.4    In 195 8, the government of Pakistan assigned responsibility for the expanding
waterlogging and salinity program to the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).
WAPDA's technical solutions focused on improving drainage, reducing seepage losses from
canals, increasing the efficiency of farmers' water management practices, and various
1. Waterlogged areas have water tables to within 5 feet of the surface for at least part of the year. "Salt-affected" areas
have salinity levels high enough to impede growth. The govemment's Water Sector Investment Plan estimates that
average yield loss in salt-affected areas relative to dry-foot crops is 25 percent; the loss is actually higher because
farmers also switch to low-value crops as salt levels increase. The figures given are in fact a simplification of the
effects of waterlogging, salt, and soda. See Govemment of Pakistan 1991; Ahmad and Kutcher 1992, pp. 3-4.

combinations of these approaches. A USAID-sponsored groundwater survey begun in 1954 led
WAPDA to initiate SCARP, which had two primary objectives: to control waterlogging and
salinity, and to develop Pakistan's extensive fresh groundwater supplies to supplement the often
irregular supplies of canal water (Lieftinck, Sadove, and Creyke 1968). SCARP's approach to
alleviating these twin problems used large public tubewells to lower the water table and thus
induce vertical drainage of the overlying soils.
1.5    The first project, SCARP I, was launched in 1961. It installed 2,100 public tubewells to
provide drainage for about 0.6 million ha in Punjab Province. Suitably fresh groundwater was
transferred to canals to be used for irrigation, saline water was dumped into rivers or evaporation
ponds, and moderately saline discharge was sometimes mixed with canal water for irrigation.
Using these methods, the project enjoyed considerable success. It virtually eliminated
waterlogging in the project area, nearly doubled the amount of water available for irrigation,
reclaimed 60 percent of previously saline lands, and increased cropping intensity by 50 percent.
Because of its success, SCARP I greatly influenced the pattern of future investment. In the
decades following, some 13,500 SCARP tubewells (almost 75 percent of them in the Punjab)
covering 3.7 million ha were installed, funded with local resources and a variety of external
financing from the IDA and other donors.
1.6    In the mid-i 960s, the government commissioned the Lower Indus Project for Sindh
(WAPDA 1966) and the Indus Special Study' to prepare a master plan for drainage. These plans
endorsed the expansion of the SCARP concept, arguing that large public sector tubewells had
significant economies of scale, could be used in areas with both fresh and saline groundwater,
augmented water supplies from canals, and ensured equitable access to groundwater, particularly
in the tail ends of canal commands, which were frequently short of water. By the late 1970s,
however, it was clear that public tubewells were no longer the solution to Pakistan's drainage
problems. Subsidies were absorbing 40 percent of the government's nondevelopment budget. In
some areas, the wells were so deep that they were drawing saline water to the surface, and
waterlogging had again become a problem. Pumping by SCARP tubewells nationwide had
declined to 40 percent of capacity, and problems in the centralized management structure meant
that deliveries of water from the wells were poorly coordinated with deliveries of canal water.
The electricity supply was equally as unreliable.
1.7    In both project and nonproject areas, farmers in areas where fresh groundwater was
plentiful were installing small private tubewells to provide irrigation.5 The number of these
wells grew rapidly, and in 1995 there were over 300,000 (fig. 1.1). In the 1970s, they were
already providing approximately 75 percent of irrigation supplies in fresh groundwater areas and
successfully keeping the water tables down. Ironically, when the SCARP public tubewells failed
to deliver, areas without SCARP intervention but with numerous private tubewells had some of
the best drainage and most reliable irrigation in the country.
2. For a review of early U.S. involvement in Pakistani drainage, see Rock and others (1982).
3. The Indus Special Study is summarized in Lieftinck, Sadove, and Creyke (1968).
4. In 1995, each SCARP tubewell cost PRs 150,000 (US$4,500) annually in operation and maintenance (O&M).
5. Private tubewells are mainly shallow, 30-50 m in depth. They use locally manufactured engines and centrifugal
pumps that typically discharge about 28 liters/second (equivalent to one cusec) or less. While farmers are driven by
the need for irrigation water, drainage is an important by-product.

1.8    This development, coupled with the shortcomings of the SCARP system, made the
alternatives to public tubewells increasingly attractive. As the number of private tubewells
burgeoned, specialists began to question the use of the large publicly funded tubewells in areas
with significant fresh groundwater (Mohammed 1965). Most policymakers, however, continued
to support the expansion of SCARP, although with some reservations. The IDA report was
ambivalent on this important strategic point. It recommended that public tubewell development
"not be undertaken in large (fresh groundwater) areas where private tubewells are spreading
rapidly." But it also said of the SCARPs, "The public tubewell program tries to steer a middle
course, including projects in areas which are predominantly underlain by fresh groundwater and
where the reclamation problems are not the most severe, but excluding areas where conditions
are the most favorable to continued rapid growth of private wells." The number of SCARP
tubewells continued to grow.

The SCAPRP Transil:ion Pilot
1.9   In 1977, the IDIA, never enthusiastic about the large public sector tubewells, agreed to
finance another project (SCARP VI) that would support the development of private tubewells.
The project offered fanrmers credit for constructing wells and promised to provide electrification
in all areas with plentifuil fresh groundwater. Because of financial constraints on the governmnent,
SCARP VI was radically redesigned in 1980. Financing for private tubewells was deleted from
the project on the grouiids that existing incentives were adequate, including a doubling of the
density of the power grid (financed by the German donor agency KfW) and low electricity
tariffs. Public tubewell development was concentrated in saline groundwater areas. Even without
project assistance, farmrers in the SCARP VI fresh groundwater areas installed enough wells to



18
keep the water table down. Using the new water supply and canal water, they were able to
achieve cropping intensities of up to 200 percent.
1.10   At the same time, the UNDP funded a new master plan, the Revised Action Plan for
Irrigated Agriculture (RAP) (WAPDA 1979), which the Bank agreed to execute. Once the
government formally adopted the RAP in 1980, Bank lending for Pakistan changed significantly
to support the plan's recommendations: improving watercourses, rehabilitating the irrigation and
drainage system, strengthening the provincial irrigation agriculture departments, and accelerating
the transition from public to private tubewells, in part by ending the tubewell subsidies (box 1.1).
Under the new plan, "water markets" were expected to develop as farmers banded together to
develop wells and smallholders who could not afford their own wells negotiated with larger
landowners for supplies.
1.11   With IDA support, WAPDA began preparing the SCARP Transition Pilot in 1981, with
the World Bank as executing agency. The project would test whether farmers, particularly
smallholders, provided with credit and subsidies would install their own tubewells when the
public wells shut down. Ancillary to that question were two others: whether the system of private
ownership would create inequities, and whether the private tubewells would be environmentally
and fiscally sustainable. Discussions on these issues took some time, and the project was
approved for an IDA credit only in May 1986.

1.12    The Bank review during project preparation raised the following issues:
*  Sociopoliticalfeasibility. Was there sufficient political support for ending the tubewell
subsidies? The govemnment of Sindh, which had serious reservations about the project
concept, did not expect the pilot to succeed and pulled out in early 1985. The government of
Punjab proposed a pilot project that would be spread throughout the entire SCARP I area at
sites where public tubewells had stopped operating or were likely to need replacing. When
Bank staff pointed oult that this plan would raise electrification costs, make it more difficult
to determine whether private pumps could meet demand, and render the project impossible
to replicate, the government agreed to locate the pilot in a specific irrigation command.
* Equity. This issue was the IDA's principal concern. Without the subsidized tubewells, the
livelihood of farmers who could not work out a joint investment in a tubewell could be
jeopardized. The idea that a fair water market would develop had no precedent in Pakistan.
In some areas, there might be only one or two wells, or even none, so that smallholders
would confront an oligopoly or market failure. The Bank felt that more than enabling
legislation would be required to protect the poorest farmers in such situations. In addition,
staff feared that the volume of canal water would be reduced when the SCARP tubewells
closed, increasing the water-short areas at the tail ends of the canals.
-  Electricity distributiosn systems. Would dedicated power lines be necessary to provide
reliable power supplies for private tubewells, or could power be supplied from a common
feeder?6 Following r egional public sector irrigation practices and the experience of SCARP
VI, the staff took the position that dedicated power lines were essential incentives.
Initial Assessments ofr the Project
1.13    Although the Project Completion Report (PCR) presented a relatively sanguine picture
of the SCARP Transition Pilot, subsequent Operations Evaluation Department (OED) reviews
disagreed with the findings. The only negative aspects the PCR discussed were delays in
procurement and consultants' appointments and possibly unnecessary costs caused by
"administrative wrangling between departments." It reestimated the economic rate of return
(ERR) at 32 percent, well above the appraisal estimate of 23 percent, primarily because actual
costs were 32 percent lower than appraisal estimates. The benefits were also lagged two years to
account for the actual imrrplementation schedule. Benefits were assumed to be as estimated in the
appraisal report despite the PCR's admission that "data collection during implementation for the
impact evaluation study are insufficient to show if there has been any increase in agricultural
production due to the project."7' 8
6. In neighboring India, through the Second Uttar Pradesh Public Tubewells Project (Credit 1332, approved March
1983), IDA financed dedicated power lines to public tubewells to assure reliability. An OED audit (Report 14732 of
June 29, 1995) finds that the dledicated power lines did not serve their purpose and that public provision of electricity
to the public wells in questionl was not reliable. The experience was confirmed in the Bihar Public Tubewells Project
(Credit 1737, approved October 1986). The ICR is Report 14409 of April 28, 1995.
7. While implementation delays delayed benefits, they are not the reason why monitoring and evaluation (M&E) did
not find any increase in agricultural production. In fact, the M&E contract was delayed until early 1989, and a
baseline survey was possible only because construction was delayed. After the "negative" findings of the 1990
surveys (no productivity gains, a decrease in equity), neither the borrower nor IDA showed any inclination to find



20
1.14   The PCR did identify two issues that could jeopardize project sustainability. The first
was the question of how to maintain acceptable groundwater levels with unregulated private
tubewells. With too few wells, the land would become waterlogged; with too many, smaller
wells would dry out as the water tables dropped. The second issue involved financial viability:
under SCARP, farmers received tubewell water at 20 percent of cost. If farmers could not
generate sufficient returns to pay for electricity for their newly installed wells, the wells would
cease operating, groundwater levels would rise, and the government would have to reintroduce
subsidies to prevent waterlogging.
1.15    The PCR rated overall outcome as satisfactory, sustainability as likely, and institutional
development as partial. OED's Director General advised the Board that the project demonstrated
conclusively the practicality of the government's privatization policy but warned that the
reestimated ERR might be exaggerated. However, in its PCR review, OED downgraded
institutional development on the basis of the PCR's muted criticisms of implementation.9 OED
also found that while private sector development had been substantial, the outcomes for the
project's poverty, natural resource management, and water quality concerns were unknown. An
audit and impact evaluation were strongly recommended.
1.16   OED's field audit benefited from the preliminary results of the field work for this impact
assessment. The audit found that it was impossible to calculate an ERR and rated the project as
marginally unsatisfactory pending the outcome of the impact evaluation. It again rated
sustainability as likely, but with the same qualifications expressed by the PCR. It rated
institutional development as substantial in view of the project's success "in destroying a loss-
making public institution of declining effectiveness." It criticized the cessation of benefits'
monitoring after the 1990 survey (Shahid, Haque, and Khan 1990), particularly since the project
was a pilot.
1.17   One of the findings from the preliminary survey conducted for the impact evaluation was
that the same degree of agricultural intensification occurred in both the project and control areas.
On the strength of these preliminary indications, the audit changed its overall assessment from
satisfactory to marginally unsatisfactory, an assessment the IDA's operating division contested,
but maintained its position that the impact survey alone would isolate the project's benefits.
The Impact Evaluation
1.18   PERI was responsible for the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the project's impact
on farmers. The preproject benchmarks for agricultural conditions, depth of the water table,
condition of the facilities, and other technical parameters were based on the 1989 survey of 24
project tubewells and a control sample of six matched nonproject tubewells (Shahid, Haque, and
Khan 1990). This survey was followed by the 1990 evaluation, which took place shortly after the
further funds for this work. When the FAO/CP PCR mission visited Pakistan, it was not "too early to make such
assessment." There were no data, because none had been gathered.
8. The Region, after review of the draft of this report, stated that PERI's case studies carried out in 1990 showed an
increase in production attributable to the project tubewells. OED has examined the evidence and can find no
information supporting this statement.
9. Of course, the essence of the project was not to build but to replace public institutions in fresh groundwater areas by
turning over their functions to private farmers. It was anticipated that the reduced public sector program would be able to
focus its efforts on improving perfonnance in saline groundwater areas where there is no private sector alternative.



21
transition pilot (Shahid and others 1992). The budget for M&E was then exhausted, and the
contract was not extended.
1.19   In October and Niovember 1993, the Bank's impact evaluation mission visited Pakistan.
The mission observed that the evaluation of the SCARP Transition Pilot Project was carried out
before the full impact of the project developed. The mission also recommended that the Punjab
Economic Research Institute (PERI) repeat the ex-post surveys to update the data on the
project's impact on agricultural production and equity and to determine whether a system of
private ownership remains in place. Accordingly, PERI conducted an ex-post evaluation of the
SCARP Transition Pilot Project (Shahid and Khan 1995).
1.20   The evaluation fDund that the number of private tubewells increased dramatically
throughout the project. Despite concerns about protests from farmers, tubewells in the SCARP
Transition Pilot area were closed, and farmers installed their own wells or began procuring water
from tubewell owners. Crop yields did not fall dramatically. The government stopped
subsidizing water for irrigation in the project area, releasing funds for other much-needed
purposes. From this standpoint, the SCARP Transition Pilot was an unqualified success.
1.21   The evaluation also found, however, that private tubewells proliferated in nonproject
areas, where farmers had not received subsidies and SCARP tubewells were still operating. Crop
yields in these areas were virtually the same as those in the project area. These findings suggest
that projects such as the SCARP Transition Pilot may not be necessary, since it may be possible
to achieve the same results simply by shutting down public wells. But a trade-off is involved in
this assumption, for while the SCARP Transition Pilot does not appear to have created large
inequities (or even to have amplified those that already existed), it did not reduce inequities to
the degree planners had hoped. And the project outcomes raise questions about the sustainability
(particularly environmental) of the new system.
1.22   The survey assesses the project's impact from the point of view of the beneficiaries
rather than the government.10 A cross section of farmers responded to questions aimed at
evaluating the following:
*  the availability, accessibility, reliability, and cost of water before and after the
project;
*  changes in cropping patterns (especially the expected shift toward high-value crops),
cropping intensity, and yields;
* changes in the use of modern agricultural inputs; and
*  economic and financial performance.

23
2.   The Project
2.1    The SCARP Transition Pilot was to be implemented over four years (FY97-FY90).
Located in the province of Punjab in the Khanqah Dogran block of SCARP I (a region known for
its high-quality basmati rice) the project would cover 46,000 ha and affect some 11,500 farm
units with an average size of approximately 4 ha. SCARP I had installed 213 high-capacity deep
electric tubewells in the project area, but the farmers wanted better, more reliable service than
these wells and the canals could supply. On their own initiative, they installed an additional
1,600 private tubewells, 600 of them diesel powered, and, at project inception, these private
tubewells were providing about 40 percent of the area's irrigation water.
Project Design
2.2    The objectives of the project were to develop, on a pilot basis, a replicable package of
technical and institutional components designed to:
*   implement the government's policy of transferring the main responsibility for
pumping fresh groundwater to the private sector in a representative SCARP area;
and
o   increase agricultural production and farm incomes by improving the use of surface
and groundwater supplies, especially among small farmers.
2.3    The project included the following components: (i) electrification for private tubewells;
(ii) the construction of private tubewells; (iii) improvements to irrigation and drainage schemes,
including the lining of minor canals and smaller distributaries over 32 kIn, and an on-farm water
management program for renovating watercourses; (iv) institutional development, comprising
technical assistance, training, and M&E; and (v) project management and supervision.
2.4    The project would fulfill its primary objective by shutting down 213 SCARP tubewells
and offering subsidies to hasten the installation of private wells and thus make a serious
reduction in drainage capacity and irrigation water supplies less likely. The project proposed to
help farmers install 2,100 private tubewells, 1,500 of them with a subsidy of PRs 16,000 for
electrical connection.12 Farmers connected to the grid could take advantage of the heavily
subsidized agricultural electricity tariffs. Farmers located too far from the power lines would
receive a subsidy of PRs 4,000 to install a diesel tubewell. The Agricultural Development Bank
of Pakistan (ADBP) agreed to provide credit for up to 95 percent of tubewell costs.
I1. SCARP tubewells are 40--120 m deep and have deep-set pumps with a capacity of 60-140 liters per second.
Private tubewells are much shallower and have smaller discharge capacities (from 7-28 liters per second). Because of
the lower discharge, the drawdown in private tubewells is much reduced, making cheaper centrifugal pumps feasible
where the water table is shallower than 10 m. Because these small tubewells draw better-quality groundwater from
the upper part of the aquifer, they help reduce salt buildup in the soil.
12. The remaining 600 would be diesel powered, with pump capacities of 14-28 liters per second.



24
Project Benefits
2.5   Improved agricultural productivity would provide the bulk of project benefits. Cropping
intensity was to increase from 125 to 150 percent and crop yields from 10 to 35 percent. Large
increases were expected in rice, wheat, and sugar cane production; the predicted incremental
production was 13,800 tons (rice), 15,200 tons (wheat) and 36,900 tons (sugar cane) at full
development in 1995. Because the cost of irrigation water would rise, the project was also
expected to double production of high-value crops such as vegetables and orchard-grown fruit.
On the basis of these assumptions, the ERR was estimated at 23 percent.
Project Costs
2.6    Total project costs were estimated at US$21.8 million (PRs 383.5 million). An IDA
credit of SDR 8.7 million (US$10 million equivalent) was to fund 46 percent of total costs, with
the government contributing 30 percent and project farmers, supported by the ADBP, the
remaining 24 percent. Fifty percent of project cost was for electrification, 25 percent for private
tubewells, 11 percent for irrigation improvement works, and the balance for project management,
technical assistance, and M&E. Four agencies-the ADBP, Punjab's Departments of Irrigation
and Agriculture, and WAPDA-were to implement the project. It would be coordinated by a
new Project Management Office in the Department of Irrigation.
2.7    When the project closed in mid-1 992, its implementation targets had been met at
substantially lower costs than projected, and US$3.9 million of the credit was canceled.
Significantly, actual expenditure on private tubewells was only 35 percent of the amount
approved, while expenditure on electrical systems reached 83 percent. The average public cost of
replacing each SCARP tubewell was about US$57,000, primarily because of the high cost of the
electrical transmission system.
Project Implementation
2.8   Implementing the project proved as politically delicate as some had feared it would be.
The first boreholes were not sunk until April 1987, almost a year after project approval, and then
the needed electrical equipment did not arrive. None of the public tubewells had been closed,
farmers had begun to doubt that they ever would be, and borehole drilling had slowed
dramatically. On November 1, the government of Punjab created a potentially volatile situation
by removing the pumps from eight public tubewells despite the fact that the electrical equipment
the project was to supply had not yet arrived.
2.9    As project staff later observed, it was a bold step. Protests were expected from farmers,
who were suddenly deprived of a heavily subsidized source of irrigation, and from tubewell
operators, who had lost their jobs. WAPDA defused the situation by hooking up, on its own, 100
private tubewells to replace the eight closed SCARP wells. After that, farmers began to believe
that the public services really would be withdrawn and to invest accordingly. To everyone's
great relief, the anticipated protests did not materialize.
What the Project Achieved
2.10   The project enjoyed several notable successes. It allowed the phasing out of some large
SCARP tubewells; encouraged the installation of small, private tubewells; helped with some



25
improvements in irrigation; and provided electrical hookups for tubewells at a lower cost than
had been estimated. The renovation schemes were the least successful: some planned renovations
were not completed, and expected beneficiary contributions did not materialize.
Phasing Out SCARP Tubewells
2.11   Prior to the installation of private tubewells, 68 of 213 SCARP tubewells were closed
down, either because the groundwater had gone saline or because they had deteriorated. Of the
boreholes, 150 were sold to individual farmers at PRs 2,000 each (US$100-115), generally to the
owner of the land on which they were located. WAPDA removed the 3 cusec (84 liters/second)
pumps for use elsewhere, and the new owners installed a variety of 1-1.5 cusec pumps. A plan
developed by WAPDA and the IDA for transferring ownership of the SCARP tubewells to a
water users' association or a group of farmers did not work out, in part because the farmers were
not sure how they could maintain the wells and in part because the farmers preferred to have
their own tubewells.
Installing Private Tubewells
2.12   A total of 2,10(0 private tubewells were installed, representing 100 percent of the original
target. The original plan had assumed that about 70 percent of these 2,100 tubewells would have
a capacity of 0.5 cusec (14 I/sec). The remaining 30 percent would have a 1.0 cusec (28 I/sec)
capacity. In fact, a majority of project farmers opted for the more powerful 1.0 cusec (28 I/sec)
tubewells (1,740 tubewells or 83 percent of total).
Improving Irrigation and Drainage
2.13   The 32 km of delivery canals specified in the original document were lined as planned, a
renovation that cost more than had been expected because the work followed the original
SCARP design, which took into account discharge into the canals from public tubewells. With
the installation of private tubewells, tubewell discharge into the canals ceased, and the canals
could have been renovated to lower conveyance capacities. Fifteen of the 182 watercourses due
for improvement were not completed for various reasons, including a lack of water users'
associations willing to participate in operation and maintenance (O&M). Beneficiaries were to
pay 70 percent of the cost of these improvements, but only 36 percent was collected.
Making the Electrical D)istribution System More Efficient
2.14   A total of 220 km of 11 kV feeders was completed, representing 113 percent of the
original target. The numaber of private tubewells connected to the grid was 100 percent of target.
The average cost of each tubewell connection was PRs 110,000 (a decrease from US$6,250 to
US$5,750 over the life of the project).
The Growth of Private Tubewells
2.15   The number of private tubewells increased within the project area during the SCARP
Transition Pilot. But the number of private tubewells increased by almost the same amount
outside the project area. Could the same results have been achieved without the pilot project?
The following chapters attempt to address that question and to determine the actual effects of the
project on private sector tubewell development.



26
3.  Private Sector Development
3.1    The overriding objective of the SCARP Transition Pilot was to encourage the ownership
of private tubewells, particularly among small farners. This chapter shows that the number of
private tubewells increased during the project for all farmners but that inequities in the pattern of
ownership remain. The chapter also presents an important conclusion: all other factors aside, the
increase in the number of privately owned tubewells was virtually the same in project and
nonproject areas. Private tubewells were widely used before the project started. They increased
by the same amount with and without the project-in other words, whether SCARP tubewells
were removed or not, whether incentives were provided or not, and whether the electric grid to
facilitate pumping was built or not. Additional findings show only small differences in farmers'
access to irrigation with the project and without it. These findings suggest that the SCARP
Transition Pilot served its purpose well and may have proved that such projects are unnecessary.
Private Tubewell Ownership and Access
3.2    The audit of the SCARP Transition Pilot found that provisions for encouraging groups of
small farmers to invest in private tubewells had not met with much success. There was no
evidence that the project had altered the earlier balance between the number of tubewells owned
by single farrners and the number owned by groups of farmers. Data on farm size and ownership
in the project and nonproject areas confirned the relationship between wealth and well
ownership. The impact survey showed that farmers operating farmns of over 10 ha in the
nonproject area who own tubewells were always sole owners. Conversely, in the project area the
number of large farners who were sole owners decreased between 1989 and 1994. As farm size
declined, the proportion of farmers who did not own their own wells increased. Although farmers
with the smallest holdings made the greatest gains in well ownership between 1989 and 1994 in
both project and nonproject areas, inequitable tubewell ownership remained the pattern (table
3.1). Farrners without their own tubewells either invested in a jointly owned well or depended on
others for their irrigation water.

3.3    The growth in tubewell ownership among small farmers may be due in part to a trade-off
between capitalization costs and what Meinzen-Dick calls the "social transaction costs of group

ownership."'3 Among the smallest farmers in the project area in 1989-94, collective ownership
seems to have fallen to about 57 percent, while sole ownership almost quadrupled. Clearly,
private tubewells were widespread before the project, and their number grew during the project.
But as table 3.1 shows, expansion of private tubewell ownership was even greater without project
intervention. Part of the greater growth in nonproject tubewell numbers can be explained by the
fact that there was more room for expansion in the nonproject area. In 1989, there was one
private tubewell for each 10.5 ha of cultivated area, compared with one per 5.6 ha in the project
area. By 1994 almost equal coverage had been achieved, with one tubewell per 5.5 ha in the
nonproject area and one per 4.7 ha in the project area (fig. 3.1).

3.4     The 1994 impact survey showed that, on balance, the better-off farmers invested in
tubewells, and farmers with smaller holdings bought water from them. Tubewell owners farmed
an average of 4.4 ha. Farmers who bought tubewell water had average holdings of 1.7 ha, and the
3 percent of farmers who neither owned a tubewell nor bought water from one owned an average
of 1.0 ha. Since irrigation water is difficult and expensive to transport, the potential for
exploiting poor farmers remains high.
3.5    In the project area, the benchmark survey showed that 70 percent of farms had access to
private tubewell water in 1989, before the project-far more than the 10 percent that IDA staff
13. Meinzen-Dick (1995) states: "The major disadvantage of joint tubewell ownership lies in the social transaction
costs, which are higher thar for sole ownership. Farmers must negotiate with each other for making the initial
purchase and deciding where to locate the tubewell. The agreements must be reached for how to share water,
expenses, and maintenance responsibility on an ongoing basis. This may be difficult in areas without established
traditions of cooperation, which has been identified as a problem in many areas of Pakistan" (pp. 95-96).

Reliability of the Postproject Water Supply
3.6     While having access to irrigation water is important, the reliability of the supply is
probably more so. 5 For this reason, farmers were asked what percentage of the time they were
able to get private tubewell water when they needed it (table 3.3). Satisfaction with the water
supply increased across all groups of farmers, but small farmers showed the greatest increase.

Tubewell Capacity Utilization
3.7     Small farmers do not have enough land to use their pumps, even small ones, to full
capacity. To do as well as their larger neighbors, they have to sell water they caninot use
14.While 89 percent of farmers in the project areas reported having access to private tubewells when asked by
enumerators, clearly 97 percent had access-52 percent as sole owners, 30 percent as joint owners, and 15 percent as water
purchasers. It is not clear why 29 respondents (8 percent of those in the project area) said they had no access to private
tubewell water in 1994, when their other answers clearly show that they did.
15. One of the chief complaints of farmers who relied on canals and public tubewells had been that supplies were
unreliable. As Meinzen-Dick (1995) reports, "Though quality of irrigation service is acknowledged to be critical,
analysis of the reliability of purchased private irrigation services and its impact on productivity has been missing from
most studies of groundwater markets."

themselves at its long-run marginal cost, which includes investnent costs. 16 Alternatively, they
can increase the return to water inputs through high-value cropping. The survey collected data on
capacity utilization, here defined as actual yearly hours of use divided by a theoretical capacity
of 24 hours/day.
3.8    The 1989 benchmark survey data showed that tubewell utilization increased with both
joint ownership and farm size (tables 3.4, 3.5). Medium-sized farms (2-10 ha) in the project area
with tubewells in joint ownership had maximum utilization, defined as exceeding 20 percent, or
the equivalent of 1,750 hours per year.

However, as the number of tubewells increased over the life of the project, overall utilization
almost halved. As cropping patterns did not change and intensity did not decline under the
project (paras. 4.5-4.7), the reduction in utilization is a clear indication of excess pumping
capacity.

Costs
3.9    Appraisal estimates put the cost of tubewells with a capacity of one cusec (28 liters/sec)
at PRs 56,250 for an electric well (including the electrical connection) and at PRs 27,000 for the
diesel version. The government subsidized these costs by remitting drainage charges and offering
a cash incentive of PRs 16,000 for the electrical connection (28 percent of the cost of installing
electric wells) and PRs 4,000 (15 percent of cost) for each diesel tubewell. In the end, actual
costs to sampled farmers were significantly below appraisal estimates, as the 1989 benchmark
survey costs illustrate (table 3.6). Given the size of the cash incentive, many farmers could have
made a small profit from the subsidy.

3.10   The PCR notes that farners did not opt for tubewells with sumps or for pump houses
with concrete floors but for the least-cost solutions they could finance themselves. Less than 10
percent utilized the credit facilities available through the ADBP. Even so, nonproject farmers
managed to install electric tubewells for two-thirds of the price of the project wells, suggesting
that the project design encouraged an element of "Rolls Royce" engineering.
3.11   Although "peter" and "cold start" diesel tubewells were 18-38 percent more expensive
than the electrical alternative, farmers may have chosen them not only because they are more
reliable but because of the relative shift in fuel prices. Between 1989 and 1993, the flat-rate
electric tariff increased by 120 percent, while diesel prices increased by only 60 percent. In the
project area, 23 percent of farmers complained of unreliable water supplies for technical reasons,
and almost three times as many farmers blamed electric loadshedding rather than the
unavailability of fuel.
3.12   Tubewell owners in project areas with farms of less than 2 ha were running their wells
only 30 percent as much as owners with 10 or more ha; in nonproject areas, the figure was 15
percent. Unless these smaller well owners were realizing massive rents on the water they sold,
the return on their investment was greatly inferior to that of larger operators. As the next section
shows, an increase in irrigation costs is associated with a switch to high-value crop production.

4.  Productionl, Income, and Equity
4.1    As chapter 3 has shown, inequities in the pattern of tubewell ownership and use
remained after the SCARP Transition Pilot. The impact evaluation set out to discover whether
farmers who could not afford private tubewells were the most seriously affected, as the IDA
feared they would be. The survey used agricultural and financial monitoring indicators (annex 2)
to determine whether the welfare of non-tubewell owners, who are exclusively smaller farmers,
suffered after the transition to private ownership. The findings were mixed but showed that,
across the board, tubewell owners did better than water buyers, who in turn did better than
farmers who relied solely on rainwater and canals. Economically, the data parallel the finding
described in chapter 3, which showed that the increase in private tubewells was approximately
the same with and without the project. Economic data suggest that the most cost-efficient way to
make the transition to private tubewell ownership is to do it without project intervention.
Whether equity is best served by this method remains an open question.
Agricultural Producition
4.2    Earlier studies in the Punjab had suggested that tubewell owners were doing much better
than water buyers. Freeiman, Lowdermilk, and Early's 1978 study showed that owners and water
buyers had higher yields than farmers who depended on canal water and rainfall alone.
However, the increase in wheat and cotton yields for tubewell owners was double that for water
buyers; for rice, it was 27 percent higher. The WAPDA's 1980 study found that tubewell owners
had higher cropping intensities, grew more crops that require substantial amounts of water, and
had higher yields for wheat, rice, sugarcane, and vegetables than water buyers. Renfro's 1982
study looked at the water use, cash inputs, cropping intensity, and gross income (per ha) of the
two groups. Cash and labor inputs of water buyers were as high as those of tubewell owners, yet
cropping intensities and gross income per ha were, like those of farmers who relied solely on
canal water, lower than those of well owners. Renfro concludes that "tubewell owners can exert
more control over water supplies, with favorable impacts on productivity."
4.3    Recent studies, however, have not confirmed these earlier findings. In their 1994 study
of Fordwah and Eastern Sadiqia, Strosser and Kuper concluded that tubewell owners achieved
higher cropping intensities than nonowners but added, "The analysis of crop yields ... did not
show any clear difference between groups of farmers characterized by different degrees of
control of the irrigation water supply." 17 Meinzen-Dick, reviewing the literature, noted, "The
differences in cropping patterns between tubewell owners, water purchasers, and non-users of
17. Data were as follows:

tubewell water are not as clear in the Intemational Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
sample villages as in the WAPDA (1980) and Renfro (1982) studies." The same is true of yields
and income. Shahid and Khan (1995) found no significant differences among project farmers,
nonproject farmers, tubewell owners, and water purchasers for the majority of the agricultural
and irrigation monitoring indicators. The amount of irrigation and fertilizer used and the timing
involved were similar in project and nonproject areas and among different types of water users
over a whole range of crops.
4.4    The next sections look first at the cropping changes that took place between 1989 and
1994 and then at how these cropping changes related to tubewell ownership status at the time of
the 1994 survey.
The Benchmark (1989) and Evaluation (1994) Surveys
Cropping Patterns
4.5    The surveys' findings showed that shifts in cropping patterns in both the project and the
nonproject areas were much more modest than expected. The appraisal had anticipated possible
incremental intensification of cropping as a result of shifts to high-value crops. In both the
project and nonproject areas, however, wheat and rice remained the predominant crops at about
the same levels. The primary shifts were to fodder and sugar cane (table 4.1). The other
quantitative shifts were small, although shifts to high-value crops like vegetables were
significant in value terms.

Fertilizer Use
4.6    Incremental fertilizer use may be a proxy for intensification. The survey results showed
that preproject fertilizer use on wheat was modestly higher in the project than in the control area;
by 1994, the reverse was true. Preproject fertilizer use on rice was similar in the project and
nonproject areas in both 1989 and 1994, although the later survey showed that the increment was
slightly higher in the project area (Shahid and Khan 1995, Table 3.11, p. 34). There was no
evidence of significant differential intensification.
Crop Yields
4.7    Incremental crop yields are another possible proxy for intensification. The survey results
showed that preproject yields were modestly higher in the project than in the control area (table
4.2). By 1994, yields had increased in both areas (except for paddy in the project area), but they
had increased more in the control area, with the exception of the small but lucrative vegetable
crop.  While the area planted with vegetables was small, the net benefit was high and had a
significant effect on overall results.

The Effects of Tubevell Ownership Status on Cropping
4.8     Breaking down the figures to account for farm size gives an indication of the project's
effects on individual farmers. Preproject data were not disaggregated to show these differences,
but postproject data were. The results, while mixed, are revealing. Specifically, cropping patterns
and yields were higher for those with access to tubewells (whether they are owners or water
buyers) than for those relying solely on rainwater and canals. In this last group, those in the
project area had no access to the public tubewells that were still available to the control group.
18. The three evaluation surveys were based on farmer recall, not on crop cutting. Because farmers do not think of fodder
or vegetable production in terms of weight per area (quintals or maunds/acre) and were generally unable to give accurate
information on yields of these crops in physical termns, the surveys collected more reliable data on gross value of output per
unit cropped. These figures capture both physical increases over time and price increases. The price increases are a mix of
real increases and of inflation. Percentage changes in PRs/ha are not comparable to those in MT/ha.

Variations in Cropping Patterns
4.9     The surveys provided no real evidence of marked differences in cropping patterns
between water users and water buyers. But the 3 percent of farmers in the project area who
depended entirely on rainfall and canal water grew significantly more fodder and far less wheat
and rice than well users (table 4.3). The differences in cropping patterns between well owners
and water buyers in both groups were minor.

4.10   The major difference across groups was the tendency for farmers who do not use
tubewells to grow less paddy in the summer, replacing some of it with fodder and oilseeds. These
farmers grew a third less paddy than well owners and more than twice as much fodder. Water
buyers also grew less paddy, but the difference was much smaller (only a little over 10 percent).
Water buyers may have been affected by the irrigation patterns of well owners. Because paddy
uses large quantities of water and is sensitive to drought stress, irrigating it may require a
tubewell's full capacity during certain seasons. In this case, owners used water for their own
crops first rather than selling to other farmers.
4.11   There were also differences between tubewell owners and nonowners in cropping
patterns for high-value items such as vegetables and sugarcane. In some instances, water
buyers-and even farmers without access to tubewells-gave these water-sensitive crops a
bigger place than well owners did. This difference may have been a function of farm size, with
smaller farmers choosing to devote their abundant labor to small areas of labor-intensive crops
such as vegetables. Tubewell owners got much higher returns from these crops than nonowners
(especially non-tubewell users) and were thus able to devote a smaller proportion of their land to
them.'9
19. Because crops such as vegetables need water in small, frequent doses, they do not tolerate the large infrequent
doses the canal system delivers, nor the unpredictable doses from SCARP tubewells in the nonproject area.



35
Crop Yields
4.12   Data on crop yields provided more precise information on how farmers fared after the
project (table 4.4). Farmers who did not use well water got lower paddy yields (by around 20
percent) than well owners and water buyers. Although water buyers in the project area had lower
yields as well, the difference was only 5 percent; in the control area, it was 13 percent. Fodder
and vegetables were a dLifferent matter, however. Well owners' fodder yields were much higher
than those of all nonowners. The gross value of the fodder/ha (which serves as a proxy for
yields) of nonusers is a little over half the value of well owners' yields in the project area and
slightly more outside it. For water buyers, the differences are 39-46 percent in the project area
and 19-21 percent outside it.
4.13   The data on cropping patterns suggested that the higher fodder yields tubewell owners
enjoy released land that was then used for high-value crops such as vegetables. In the project
area, owners grossed PRs 15,438/ha from their vegetables, 79 percent more than the PRs
8,645/ha of the farmers who bought water. This difference suggests that owners were giving
themselves better irrigation service than they were giving their water purchasers--an outcome
that clearly shows one of the benefits of tubewell ownership.

Cropping Intensity
4.14   Cropping intensity was significantly higher for well owners than for farmers relying on
rainwater and canals (around 25 percent in the project area and 13 percent outside) (table 4.5).
But well owners had only slightly higher cropping intensities than water buyers-2.5 percent for
the project area and 3.3 percent for the nonproject area.

4.15   The effect of well ownership on cropping intensity is clearer when the data are
disaggregated by farm size (table 4.6). On average, the farms of tubewell owners, water buyers
and nonbuyers differed in size, and farm size had an impact on cropping intensity. Farmers with
less land used it more intensively, while those with more land were under less pressure to farm to
full capacity. And it was the farmers with smaller holdings who increased cropping intensity the
most, both in the project area and outside of it. Nevertheless, when the data are adjusted for farm
size, well owners did marginally better than water buyers.

Farm Income
4.16   Incremental netfarm income generated by the project is the best indicator of changes in
participants' economic welfare. This indicator incorporates changes in cropping patterns and use
of inputs, as well as higher yields resulting from project intervention. But it omits some
sociological factors, such as risk aversion and the division of labor by gender. In the project area,
the 1989 benchmark survey showed that the average annual net farm income before the project
was PRs 995 per ha (table 4.7). Five years after the project began, it was PRs 1,158, an increase
of 16 percent or PRs 163/ha. In the nonproject area, the average annual net farm income per ha
was PRs 820 in 1989 and PRs 921 in 1994, an increase of 12 percent or PRs 101/ha (Shahid and
Khan 1995, Table 3.15, p. 41). In annual terms, incremental net farm income attributable to project
intervention was PRs 163 minus PRs 101, or PRs 62 per ha per year.
4.17   Netfarm income is the best single proxy for the success of farming operations.20 For this
indicator, outcomes were roughly as expected at appraisal. However, nonproject farmers
achieved similar benefits without the project, rendering the farm benefits quite modest. Further,
when the figures were corrected for inflation to 1994 prices, they showed a decrease in real terms
of 28 percent (PRs 445/ha) for the project area and 30 percent (PRs 400/ha) for the nonproject
area. While project farms still fared better than nonproject farms, the overall project benefits
were small.
4.18   Tables 4.7 shows net farm income disaggregated for farm size. The table shows not only
that the income gains from the proliferation of private tubewells were small but that they were
relatively uniformly distributed.
20. Net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and the sum of cash costs, inputs of family labor,
rent of land and depreciation and interest on capital items.

4.19   Table 4.8 correlates tubewell ownership and net farm income distribution in 1994.
Tubewell owners did better than water buyers, who did better than farmers without access to
private tubewell water. The differences here stemmed partly from differences in farm size and
partly from the fact that well owners had the best access to water.

4.20   The project had a positive impact on the share of net cash household income going to
small farmers (table 4.9). In 1989, small farming households (less than 5 ha) in both the project
and nonproject areas received about 27 percent of total household income. By 1994, their share
in the project area had increased to about 34 percent. Among the large farmers, the project had a
greater impact on equity by reducing their share by 22 percent, compared with 15 percent in the
nonproject area. Overall, the modest gains from the development of private tubewells were
marginally greater in the project area than in the nonproject area.

5. The Economics of the SCARP Transition
5.1     Economic analysis shows that while the returns to the SCARP Transition Pilot
investments were satisfactory, they derived primarily from savings to the government. Actual
on-farm returns were negligible and would have been losses without the elimination of
government subsidies for public tubewells. In the light of this finding, the evaluation asks
whether there is a more cost-effective way to produce the same results. And given that market
imperfections and some farmer dissatisfaction remain, the evaluation examines two alternatives
to the system promoted under the SCARP Pilot.
Economic and Financial Returns
5.2     Assuming that the sample farms have fully adjusted to the transition from SCARP
tubewell irrigation to private tubewell irrigation, the modest net incremental on-farm benefit-
PRs 62/ha/year-is the financial benefit to project beneficiaries. Converted to economic prices
and adjusted for public savings (the amount of SCARP subsidies the government did not have to
pay), net of subsidies paid to private tubewell operators, it becomes the stream of economic
benefits.21
5.3     The project's ERR-the return to Pakistan-is based on the impact evaluation's findings
(annex 3). The principle project benefits are the savings to the government from shutting down
the public tubewells in the project area and not investing in electrification. While the project's
on-farm benefits are negligible, these savings led to an acceptable ERR of 18 percent on the
resources invested in the project.
5.4     While the project was a satisfactory investment from this point of view, the impact
evaluation survey shows that there is a lower-cost path to the same results-that is, that
substantially the same farming results can be reached without such a project. The project's
electric grid (and free power connections), canal improvements, technical assistance,
administration, training, and monitoring and evaluation were, in retrospect, not needed to
stimulate investment in private tubewells. It should be possible, after appropriate notification,
simply to discontinue SCARP tubewells in fresh groundwater areas without such interventions
and to achieve the same result. This fact was not obvious when the SCARP Transition Pilot
began. In demonstrating it, this pilot project served its purpose.
21. The Region recommended that the economic analysis take account of the subsidized cost of water provided by
SCARP tubewells in the nonproject area because this would increase nonproject on-farm benefits thus reducing net
incremental benefits attributable to the project. OED's analysis computes net incremental benefits on the basis of with-
without agricultural performance in which water is only one component. Indeed, removing the effect of SCARP
subsidies would nullify the without project comparator which is the SCARP project. Even if we wished to evaluate the
effect of subsidies, this could not be done with the data available. The average amount paid for irrigation water in the
project area and nonproject area was collected as part of the ex-post surveys, and it is clear that farmers in the
nonproject area paid much less than project area farmers. However, there are insufficient data to determine how far the
amount paid for water is affected by water subsidies. Other factors affecting the amount paid for water in the
nonproject area compared to the project area include the changing mix of canal, public and private water supplies
between benchmark and ex-post surveys, significantly different cropping patterns during the Kharif, different and
unknown private tubewell technologies and power sources that affect water cost, and the imbalance of canal supply
and demand that would decrease the volume of water and hence the amount paid for water



39
Fiscal Returns
5.5    Fiscal returns to the project were obviously high. The government captured more than
70 percent of the project's net present value (NPV) for a return on the investment of more than
50 percent (annex 3). Dispensing with the investments that made up the project's off-farm costs
(and which were in fact unnecessary) would have raised this figure still more. In fresh
groundwater areas, for instance, the government could simply have given appropriate advance
notice, withdrawn its tubewell services, and removed its pumps to saline groundwater areas.
Financial Returns
5.6    With the govermment realizing such a large share of the net benefits, is there anything
left for farmers? OED's audit found groups of small farmers who had invested in tubewells and
were finding it hard to pay the cost of pumping. These farmers cursed the IDA and the
withdrawal of the highly subsidized SCARP tubewell service.22 Group ownership and operation
do impose costs on the participants, as forming a group and keeping it running is not easy (see
Olstrom 1992; Tang 1'992). But the evidence suggests that returns to these tubewells should have
been sufficient to allow the owners to cover their costs (see the section on group-owned wells
below).
5.7    To assess the retums to well investments, the impact evaluation used not only data
gathered for the survey but data collected in the Faisalabad District by the International Irrigation
Management Institute (IIMI) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(Meinzen-Dick 1995). These data present a forward-looking picture of private tubewell
investments, since the actual costs to SCARP Transition Pilot farmers in 1986-92 are outdated.
Economies of scale have developed over the intervening years, and smaller, more efficient diesel
motors are now available. Meinzen-Dick found that the average annual investment cost for
tubewells was PRs 8,852 (US$354) for electric wells and PRs 5,544 (US$222) for diesel
tubewells. Electric-powered wells cost PRs 667 annually to repair and maintain, diesel-powered
wells PRs 895. Using elaborate multiple-regression analysis, the study established the following
annual incremental gross margins for private tubewell use: PRs 5,365 (US$215) when canal
irrigation is not available, and PRs 15,326 (US$613) when it is.23 On this basis, without canal
water, an electric pumper gets a return of 6 percent on land, labor, investment, and experience
and a diesel pumper 1:2 percent. When farmers have access to canal irrigation and use their
tubewells to supplement it, an electric-powered pumper gets a return of 24 percent, a diesel
pumper 46 percent.
22. OED Report 14769 of June 30, 1995, para. 4.17, p. 61.
23. Diesel and electric pumps generate equal irrigation. Manifestly, pump irrigation has a much higher average value
when it is the "peaking power" and canal irrigation the "base load."



40
5.8    Based on these calculations, most SCARP Transition Pilot tubewell investors should
have made good returns on their investments. Almost all were served by canal irrigation, though
the supply was sometimes problematic at the tail ends of the canals. Smaller farmers complained
about the cost of operating tubewells, a reflection of their anger at the withdrawal of the
subsidies and the difficulties of successfully budgeting for the resulting increase. But the reason
for the small net incremental on-farm benefit attributable to the project is not that farmers in the
project areas did not do well, but that nonproject farmers did just as well.
Alternatives to the SCARP Pilot
5.9     Given the inequities discussed in chapter 4, the evaluation team asked if there is a more
cost-effective solution that would generate approximately the same agricultural results and
improve equity (or at least not create further inequities). Seen in the context of other research in
Pakistan and of development experience in India, the survey results suggest that there may be.
Water Markets
5.10    Clues to potentially superior solutions lie in the markets that have developed for
irrigation water in Pakistan.24 These markets permitted 15 percent of the farmers in the project
area (five-sixths of non-tubewell owners) to share the benefits of the investments of their
neighbors. Tubewell owners with more water than they could use on their land were able to sell
the excess water and improve their returns. In contrast to studies in the late 1970s and early
1980s, Shahid and Khan (1995) show that water buyers are not exploited by their well-owning
neighbors but share in the benefits of those investments, doing almost as well agriculturally as
well owners.
5.11    The impact survey's analysis stops there, but work in the same area by IIMI and IFPRI
provides further insights.  Because the price of tubewell water is the O&M costs of the pump
that delivers it, costs are highest for tractor-powered pumps and lowest for the electric variety.
On average, the cost is PRs 32 (about US$ 1) per hour, a price that does not vary with the season
or with shortages or surpluses. When pumps reach capacity during the summer, pump owners
simply stop selling to water buyers. Meinzen-Dick (1995) reports that for Faisalabad, "there are
numerous occasions on which tubewell water is not available to water buyers at any cost, despite
their demand for it."
5.12   Meinzen-Dick, a sociologist, seeks the cause of these market imperfections. Most
transactions take place among neighbors. The practical limit for water sales is a radius of 300 m
around the well, unless the channels are lined, in which case sales may extend more than one
kilometer from the well.26 In the Faisalabad area, buyers are likely to be relatives and
24. The evaluation surveys reveal a market for private tubewell water. Strosser and Kuper (1994) reveal that canal water
is also traded illegally at 10-15 times the official rate.
25. Most prominently, Meinzen-Dick (1995), Malik and Strosser (1993), and, covering a nearby area of the Punjab,
Strosser and Kuper (1994).
26. For a review of evidence on benefits and costs of canal lining, see OED's impact evaluation of Pakistan Credits 1163,
1239, 1487 and 1603 (Report 15863-PAK, 1996).



41
transactions highly personal. Apparently, this fact engenders high transaction costs for the seller,
who is unable to charge his own long-run cost to his relatives.27 Buyers benefit by getting water
more cheaply than they could have through their own tubewell investments, but the service is
less reliable because it can be cut off.
5.13   Whatever their cause, these market imperfections have three important effects. First,
water buyers get lower-quality irrigation than well owners, even though buyers would probably
be willing to pay more for water at critical times. Second, most well owners are not able to fully
exploit their investments because they sell water below cost. And third, there are more wells and
pumps-more investment-than there would be in a perfect market.
5.14   With a perfect market, the investment cost for a specified level of irrigation would be
lower, buyers willing to pay for the same service as owners would receive it, and owners would
sell water at a price that gave them a return to their investment. Such a market would resolve the
problems discussed here.
5.15    Shah (1991) has argued that groundwater markets are becoming less personal over time.
Groundwater markets seem to be improving in Gujarat and in the Pakistani Punjab, accounting
for the differences in thte findings of the studies conducted in the 1970s and early 1980s and
those of the more recen,t studies cited here. Groundwater markets are a relatively recent
phenomenon and have developed independently of government intervention (and often illegally).
Their potential as a solution to problems of access and equity argues for their inclusion in the
formulation of future iirigation policy.
Group Ownership
5.16   The utilization rate is higher for group-owned than for individually owned tubewells.
For the Fordwah/Eastern Sadiqia, where the IIMI has specifically studied water markets,
individual tubewells averaged 616 hours of operation per year. Group-owned wells averaged 816
hours, or 32 percent more (Malik and Strosser 1993). Group ownership, while sometimes
problematic, benefits not only the group but society. Using the Fordwah/Eastern Sadiqia
example, the same irrigation could be achieved with 25 percent fewer wells and pumps, thanks to
higher capacity utilization, at a cost savings (net of the cost of forming the groups and keeping
them operating) of 25 percent.
5.17   These returns could be even better, for two reasons. First, group ownership is more
efficient than the still-imperfect water markets. As chapter 3 showed, water buyers, who
purchase water below cost, do remarkably well agriculturally. But they still do not do as well
agriculturally as owners, because the service is less reliable. Group ownership eliminates this
problem. Moreover, since water buyers and group owners tend to have smaller farms than sole
well owners, group ownership also promotes equity.
27. An alternative explanation would be that overinvestment in wells and pumpsets (inspired by the prestige attached to
owning one) is such that small fanners, without enough land of their own to fully use their investments, are desperate to
sell water, even at less than cost. This hypothesis, however, is not consistent with a stable year-round price. Owners who
have behaved irrationally by investing in more pumping capacity than they can use would be irrational not to sell water,
even when it is scarcest and most in demand on their own farms.



42
5.18   Second, almost lost in the above discussions of efficiency and equity are the
environental issues raised above and discussed in chapter 6: the dangers of uncoordinated
pumping by thousands of independent well owners, of insufficient pumping (leading to
waterlogging), and of excessive pumping (leading to a drop in water tables below the operating
depth of centrifugal pumps, unproductive investments , exaggerated pumping costs, and
excessive salt buildup in soils and groundwater). A system that includes private wells but also
has a high proportion of group-owned wells would probably also be easier to regulate when it is
in the public interest to do so. Like water markets, group ownership has the potential to ease
problems of equity and access and should be considered in future policy decisions.

6.    Sustainability
6.1    The 1994 impact evaluation survey found that a third of the farmers in both the project
and nonproject areas believed that the SCARP Transition Pilot had made the condition of their
soil and water worse (Shahid and Khan 1995). Investigations show that about a quarter of the
wells are in fact still braickish. And while farmers have managed to control the salinity of the soil
thus far, the problems go well beyond the project, with potentially severe environmental
consequences. This chapter discusses these issues and the related problem of unregulated
pumping, all of which need to be addressed if Pakistan's irrigation system is to be privatized and
remain viable.
Water Tables and Water Quality
The Water Table
6.2    To evaluate fluctuations in the water table resulting from the SCARP Transition Pilot,
PERI collected data from the commands of ten SCARP tubewells that had been shut down and
compared them with 1989 data for the same sites at the same time of year. The 1994 water-table
depth varied from 3.3 mn to 5.5 m; the average was 4.7 m, with a standard deviation of 1.0 m.
Compared with a 1989 average of 4.4 m, the water table had fallen an average of 0.3 m. As the
1994 survey report says, "The lowering of the water table depth is a positive development of the
project" (Shahid and Khan 1995). Had the water table been raised or lowered substantially, the
impact would have been negative.
Water Quality
6.3    The 1994 survey asked farmers' opinions on the quality of their private tubewell water.
The results for the project and nonproject areas did not differ significantly (44 and 52 percent,
respectively), but over one-third of farmers in both areas reported that their private tubewell
water was brackish or umfit for irrigation.28 To determine the exact nature and likely cause of the
problem, PERI retested the water quality from 40 previously tested tubewells. All 40 samples
passed electroconductivity and sodium absorption ratio tests, as well as sodium, calcium and
magnesium tests, but eight were found to have levels of residual sodium carbonate slightly
higher than the permitted level, and two had levels over 80 percent higher. Altogether, 25 percent
of the samples were pronounced unfit, even if most of them were only marginally so.
6.4    These results were an improvement on the preproject situation, when water from 9Q
percent of the tubewells registered as unfit. Electrical conductivity had declined by 39 percent on
average and residual sodium carbonate by 88 percent. Though the sodium absorption ratio had,
on average, increased by 61 percent, it was still within acceptable limits in all cases. The survey
did not test water quality in wells outside the project area.
28. Asked how they knew tubewell water was having adverse effects on their soil, 80 percent of the farmers said they
could see it, and the rest cited the results of soil or water tests. When asked the nature of the adverse effect, most
farners mentioned the white salt that appeared on the surface when the soil was dry, and/or soil hardening. See Shahid
and Khan 1995.



44
Soil Quality
6.5    Given the area's semi-arid conditions, salt and exchangeable sodium buildup in soils is a
problem, as there is not enough rainfall to leach the salt out. With private tubewell irrigation,
farmers should be able to recognize, diagnose and solve this problem by applying enough water
to leach salts down to levels that will not result in too much crop damage-at least if the
tubewell water itself is not too salty. To see whether the farmers were correct, the impact
evaluation survey collected and analyzed soil samples from the commands of 41 wells, analyzed
them, and compared measures of salinity, sodicity, and alkalinity with 1989 preproject readings.
In 85 percent of the samples, soil alkalinity, salinity and sodicity were within acceptable levels.
The other 15 percent were saline, and half were sodic as well. But the tests also revealed that
salinity (as measured by electrical conductivity) had increased by 82 percent on average, sodicity
(as measured by sodium absorption ratio) by 13 percent, and alkalinity (as measured by pH) a
modest 5 percent. At one test site the soil was saline and sodic enough to inhibit growth.
6.6    The survey findings show that except for the one saline/sodic plot, farmers were letting
salts build up, but not to the point of seriously affecting farming, and were using tubewell water
to leach the salts when the concentration became too high. They also show a sharp increase in the
percentage of cultivated land that farmers considered saline, from 0.6 percent in 1989 to 18
percent in 1994. Private tubewells have apparently improved the farmers' ability to cope with
salinity: they cannot get rid of it, but by leaching with private tubewell water, they can keep it
under control.
6.7    These results do not touch on a far more serious problem, however. Even in the "fresh
groundwater" area where the project fanns are located, water from the shallow aquifer, which
shallow tubewells tap, is more saline than canal water from the Indus system. Because salt is not
absorbed by the plants and does not evaporate, soil salinity rises as shallow pumping increases.29
Leaching it out of the root zone only returns it to the aquifer, where it once more contributes to
the salinity of the groundwater. While the SCARP Transition Pilot farmers apparently were able
to manage the salt levels of their soil well, the salinity is part of a much more widespread
problem that shallow private tubewells cannot solve-and which they may actually make worse.
6.8    The environmental consequences of secondary salinization are potentially devastating,
but cost-effective solutions are available. The government is tackling the problem of salinity
caused by brackish tubewell water by providing subsidies for the use of gypsum. Returns from
gypsum application to rice-wheat rotation far exceed its cost in Pakistan (Siddiq I 994), and a
similar subsidized program was very successful in the Indian Punjab.30
29. For a global view of Pakistan's salinity problem, see Mulk 1993. World Bank (1994) includes a 28-page summary.
30. Some critics maintain that subsidies should be stopped, however, arguing that the PRs 100 million spent on the
program in 1991 could have been used to finance campaigns to increase the awareness of the benefits of gypsum
application and to fund extension services to ensure that it was used efficiently. See Pakistan: Economic Policies,
Institutions, and the Environment. Report 15781-PAK, World Bank, 1996.



45
Unregulated Pumpin,g
6.9     The SCARP Transition Pilot area is now well drained, and the water table has not yet
fallen to levels at which pumping becomes prohibitively expensive or centrifugal pumps can no
longer reach the water table. But with thousands of pumps operating independently without
coordination or planning, can this result be maintained? The Khankah Dogran area is close to
major supply canals and difficult to pump down, but the same is not true for all the Punjab.
Unregulated shallow tubewell development treats groundwater as a free public good, allowing
farmers to pump as much as they like. This condition, especially when combined with the
problem of salinity, argues against sustainability.
6.10    If there is a case for regulation in the public interest to ensure the supply of a precious
natural resource and prevent environmental damage, there is also a case on the grounds of
economic efficiency. As the survey shows, without regulation, private individuals and groups
have invested in many miore tubewells and pumps than are necessary to irrigate the area. Overall
tubewell capacity use in the project area was 7 percent in 1994, but only 4 percent for the
smallest farmers.31 Until the optimal capacity-utilization figure is determined, it remains at least
the 13 percent achieved by the larger farmers.32 The optimal figure will probably be somewhat
higher, but even so, private tubewell capacity in the project and control areas is currently twice
what it needs to be to deliver the irrigation results now being achieved.
6.11    These calculations compare full development to what the more efficient private farmers
are already achieving, not to the much higher efficiencies of large public SCARP wells, which
averaged 70 percent utilization in 1960. Even in 1985, when the system was reeling from poor
maintenance, they averaged 45 percent (Malik and Strosser 1993). While private tubewell
development is effective, it is clearly not the least-cost solution to the irrigation problem, even if
it does minimize social and transaction costs.33 But direct regulation also may not be the most
effective way to control groundwater demand.
31. IIMI's study in the same area found an average utilization rate (also based on 20 hrs/day) of 9.4 percent with 55
percent of the wells below 5 percent (Malik and Strosser 1993). At Fordwah/Eastem Sadiqia, IIMI found a utilization rate
of 10 percent (Strosser and Kviper 1994).
32. Capacity utilization of 7 percent does not mean that there is 14 times (the reciprocal) the installed capacity needed to
irrigate the command. Even ifithe marginal cost were zero, it would not be useful to run tubewell pumps 20 hours/day on
average. Circumstances vary. In Khankah Dogran, to use an electric power analogy, rainfall and canal water form the
base load, and private tubewell water is the peaking capacity. Tubewell use and water sales peak in July-October for
kharif, with a smaller rabi mode in January-March. Strosser and Kuper (1994) show a similar situation on five
watercourses in Fordwah/Eastem Sadiqia. Even relatives farming a large area with an electric pump and paying a flat rate
for electricity (and thus with the financial incentive not to economize) averaged only about four pumping hours/day (20
percent utilization factor). They used the pumps to full capacity only when rain and canal water was insufficient for the
paddy crop. Farmers farming more than 10 ha in the evaluation sample and control averaged 13 percent capacity
utilization (Shahid and Khan 1995). The optimum capacity utilization according to these calculations should be around 15
percent.
33. For similar findings on the high cost of private groundwater development in India's Ganga Plain, see OED's audit of
India-Second Uttar Pradesh Public Tubewells Project (Credit 1332, approved March 1983), OED Report 14732 of June
29, 1995. The IDA's current policy favors such private groundwater development in India.



46
Water Pricing Policy and Sustainability
6.12   Water pricing policy profoundly affects the utilization of water investments and the
efficiency of fresh water resource use, thus affecting waterlogging and salinity. This fact was
ignored when the SCARP transition project was being prepared, although pricing policies
subsequently had a major impact on farmers' selection of pumping equipment (para. 3.11).
6.13   Pakistan's economic policies on environmental management do not include pricing
incentives to conserve water. The subsidy for canal water accounts for more than 50 percent of
O&M costs and is much higher if measured in terms of the opportunity cost or the cost of
tubewell water. Underpricing water and basing charges on the area irrigated rather than on the
actual quantity applied have eliminated incentives to use water efficiently and aggravated
waterlogging and salinity (Ahmad and Kutcher 1992). Underpricing discourages not only water
conservation but also private investments aimed at making irrigation more efficient, such as the
lining of on-farm watercourses and drip or trickle irrigation. Not surprisingly, despite the large
number of on-farm water management projects implemented since 1978, only about half the
conservation savings envisaged in the government's RAP have been achieved.34
6.14   Further, tubewell drilling and electricity are still subsidized, and tubewell drilling is not
restricted, even though tubewell water is traded at a price several times higher than canal water.
In areas where groundwater is limited, then, there is no way of regulating groundwater use. The
standard response to this problem is to regulate installed capacity, either by issuing licenses or
restricting tubewell density. But such regulation has proved not only ineffective but inequitable,
for several reasons (Johnson 1992). First, the certification process is open to manipulation by
both farmers and officials. Second, because most wells are drilled privately, they are difficult to
monitor.35 Third, controlling installed capacity tends to formalize existing inequalities
governing access to groundwater supplies, because the richer farmers own the bulk of the
existing wells. Controlling tubewell density would only shut out small farmers altogether. And
even if the controls could be made effective, they would not guarantee that water supplies were
properly regulated, since there would be few price incentives to induce conservation.
6.15   Economic policy also distorts tubewell water use. Recent research on the effect of water
pricing on use in the SCARP I Lager distributary in 1988-89 clearly shows a strong inverse
relationship between price and volume used (Johnson 1992) (fig. 6.1).
6.16   Electrical power tariffs promote the overexploitation of groundwater resources. Data
from Johnson (1992) and Meinzen-Dick (1996) show that while the cost differential between
flat-rate electricity and diesel costs has narrowed between 1988-89 and 1991-92, electrically
powered wells are still the cheaper option (fig. 6.2). Even then, the way in which electricity is
billed also has a marked effect on the volume of groundwater pumped. Those with metered
billings pay by the kilowatt-hour used, so that the amount they pay is directly tied to the volume
pumped. Those paying a flat rate pay the same irrespective of the volume pumped and thus have
no incentive to conserve. In the Lagar command of SCARP, for example, for farmers with
holdings of comparable size, flat-rate electric wells pumped almost twice as much as their
metered counterparts and almost four times as much as nonelectric wells (Johnson 1992).
34. OED, Report 15863-PAK 1996.
35. Even the official survey for the SCARP transition project seriously underestimated the number of private wells.

6.17   Developing this argument further, Johnson (1992) argues that if the money invested in
the SCARP transition pilot project had been invested differently, there could have been
substantial equity and environmental benefits. He estimates that 13,000 diesel-power tubewells
could have been installed instead of the 2,100 SCARP transition pilot wells. Even better, if the
pilot project had invested only in drilling boreholes and installing tubewells, leaving farmers to
provide the pumps, almost 20,000 boreholes could have been installed. Even though the numbers
are large, current practices indicate that farmers would have relied on tractor pumping, at least
initially. Given the high cost of water that tractor pumping entails, there would have been a
marked conservation effect.
6.18   Inattention to the effects of underpricing water and of subsidies on the proliferation of
private tubewells can have a major impact on the sustainability of groundwater-based irrigation.
Johnson's study (1992) shows that the safe yield of the aquifer is being exceeded by more than
35 percent, and OED analysis for Pakistan as a whole shows a modest mining of groundwater in
freshwater areas but a continued rise in groundwater levels in saline water zones (table 6.1).
6.19   Water pricing policy could be a powerful tool to ensure sustainability. Increasing the
cost of canal water would lower overall water use and thus the volume of seepage that
replenishes fresh groundwater areas. In fresh groundwater areas, a further decline in the water
table would gradually reduce both groundwater losses from evaporation and concentrations of
salts near the surface. If full-cost pricing of groundwater were effective, the increased depth of
the water table would also increase the cost of tubewell water and induce farmers to use water
more efficiently.

6.20 Clearly, at some point rising groundwater costs would force farmers to reduce pumping
so much that their private tubewells would no longer provide sufficient drainage. Thus, there are
sound economic arguments for the differential pricing of canal water and the elimination of flat-
rate pricing of electricity. In saline areas, where farmers need to increase their drainage capacity
and  reduce seepage by lining watercourses, raising the price of canal water could generate the
revenue to pay for such measures and induce conservation. Conversely, in fresh groundwater
areas, lowering the price of canal water would maintain seepage inflows and recognize that
private tubewell owners are providing a public good in using vertical drainage. On balance, a
robust policy for water pricing could eliminate the need for measures to directly regulate private
sector access to groundwater.

7.    Conclusions
7.1    The SCARP Transition Pilot achieved its objectives: to transfer responsibility for
pumping fresh groundwater from the public to the private sector, and to increase agricultural
production and farm incomes (especially for small farmers) through the improved use of surface
and groundwater supplies. Farmers installed their own wells and were able to beat the costs
themselves. The improved irrigation service has generally been sufficient to provide acceptable
returns on these investments. Productivity gains from higher yields and cropping intensities and
shifts to high-value crops have been sufficient to offset the additional costs, although the
increases have not been as great as appraisers hoped. The water table has not been disturbed or
the soil harmed, and water quality has improved. And despite expectations to the contrary, the
transition has had a modest but positive effect on income distribution.
7.2    The project outcome is satisfactory and its sustainability likely, despite some long-term
doubts. Institution building in the private sector was substantial, including groups of well
owners and a market nexus of owners willing to sell water and nonowners willing to buy it. Most
projects with such ratings would be worth repeating, but the SCARP Transition Pilot is not, as
the same results were achieved at far less cost in similar areas without the project's interventions.
The impact evaluation survey shows that the project's achievements were part of an upsurge in
investment in private tubewells that was already taking place when the project began and that
continues in fresh grotmdwater areas all over the Punjab.
A "Demonstration ]Effect"?
7.3    Proponents of the SCARP Transition Pilot argue that the achievements outside the
project area were the result of the project's "demonstration effect" and ought to be claimed as
benefits.36 The survey's control group was changed in response to complaints that the control
was tainted by the proximity of transition. Even after the changes, however, some believe that
the control merely captured more of the project's benefits.
7.4    Can the critics be correct? If they are, several factors could have stimulated the "effect."
The removal of eight SCARP pumps in November 1, 1987, signaled that the government of
Punjab was serious about abandoning SCARPs in fresh groundwater areas. The project and the
IDA's support for it may have offered the government of Punjab the courage it needed to take
this step. But the upsurge of private tubewell investment has been so geographically widespread
that it seems implausible to attribute all or even much of it to this pilot scheme.
7.5    Ultimately, however, whether the SCARP Transition Pilot was indirectly responsible for
the increase in private tubewell investment outside the project area is merely an interesting
historical question. Far more important is the question of what should be done now, given what
has been learned from the pilot.
7.6    When the preliminary findings of the impact evaluation survey first became known, an
OED mission visited thie Provincial Irrigation Department (PID) to ask whether the tentative

project area when the without-project outcomes turned out to be identical to project results.

results seemed to ring true. The officials confirmed that the private tubewell investment
phenomenon was widespread and, most likely, just as intense outside the project area as within
it. The most appropriate way to achieve the project objectives throughout Punjab's fresh
groundwater areas, the PID officials suggested, was the "do-nothing mode." Arguably, they are
right, but considering the potential environmental and sustainability problems involved in
unregulated private tubewell development (chapter 6), simply letting things take their course
may not be sufficient.
Plans for the Future
7.7    In preparing the follow-on Privatization of Groundwater Development project, both the
IDA and the borrower are mindful of the lessons of the SCARP Transition Pilot project and of
the tentative lessons of its on-going sequel, the Second SCARP Transition project. General
subsidies for private tubewell investment have been eliminated as unnecessary, as have
electricity subsidies, which skew the choice among diesel, electric, and tractor-powered pumping
(most farmers opt for diesel). The project under preparation recognizes the ineffectiveness of
SCARP Transition Pilot's efforts to promote group ownership. However, the restructured
Second SCARP Transition project community organization's efforts have led to installation of
S500 tubewells in Punjab and Sindh in just two years. The new project is expected to focus its
promotional efforts exclusively on community-owned tubewells. Investment assistance would be
provided to cover the costs of forming and maintaining groups. But the assistance will be geared
toward promoting a small number of intensively used community tubewells rather than a large
number of underutilized individually owned tubewells, because the community wells will
provide the greatest social benefits.
7.8    This effort would break new ground in Pakistan. It has parallels in India, however. In the
Ganga Plain, uncoordinated sinking and pumping of private tubewells has led to serious
depletion of the aquifer in many locations. The authorities have forbidden further groundwater
development in some areas (known as "black zones") and regulates it tightly in others ("gray
zones"). As in Pakistan, the traditional public tubewell system is in disarray. Attempts to
improve it with tubewell systems engineered to design around the problems were initially
declared successful. Subsequent examination has shown that these efforts failed miserably in
Uttar Pradesh and in Bihar. 37 In West Bengal, however, the package was further modified and is
succeeding.38 A small Indo-Dutch project in eastern Uttar Pradesh with similar characteristics is
also succeeding.39 What these successful adaptations have in common is (a) public identification
and fostering of community groups; (b) public construction or rehabilitation of groundwater
systems to high standards;40 41 and (c) community ownership and operation of the systems.

Similar measures are being proposed under the Privatization of Groundwater Development
project. Based on the findings of this impact evaluation, this fact alone is grounds for optimism.
41. The Region states that rehabilitating SCARP tubewells is not an option for Pakistan. The tubewell technology is
too complex, and SCARP tobewells, being deeper than private tubewells, tap poorer quality groundwaters.

Revised Economnic Analysis
1.    The analysis of costs in the Project Completion Report (PCR) includes major benefits
from cost savings to the government from shutting down the SCARP public tubewells in the
project area. This analysis is confirmed, with one exception. The PCR's assumption of
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for large irrigation canals without the project (PRs
5,200 million at full development) as opposed to much lower with-project costs (PRs 1,325
million) is not reasonable.1 As it stands, this difference represents a major project benefit. In
fact, there is no reason to believe that project expenditures on canal improvement lowered O&M
costs, and certainly not to one-fourth of what they would have been in the absence of the project.
This alleged benefit has been eliminated.
2.    The PCR's adjustments from prevailing (financial) to national (economic) prices are
confirmed.2
3.    The PCR's analysis of net farmn benefits,3 which admittedly never had an empirical
basis,4 has been discarded in favor of a calculation based on the findings of the impact evaluation
survey: a net incremental on-farm benefit of PRs 62/ha. This figure is not adjusted to economic
prices because (a) the net adjustments are minor, as the PCR shows; and (b) the on-farm benefits
are so small that such adjustments would not materially affect the economic rate of return (ERR).
The PCR has correctly reported the size of the affected areas and the numbers of new tubewells
installed per year. It has been assumed that no production is lost in the switch from public to
private tubewells, that no gains are realized in the year of the changeover, and that an additional
one-fifth of the full-development increment of PRs 62/ha is realized in each of the subsequent
five years as the farmer adjusts to his new resource. This assumption may be conservative but,
like price adjustments, it does not materially affect the ERR because on-farm benefits are already
so small.
4.    The ERR-1 8 percent-is principally the savings to Pakistan of not operating SCARP
tubewells in the project area, of not having to spend PRs 40,000 million on power supply
improvements in 1987-88, and of not having to replace the project area's SCARP tubewells in
1987-92. The analysis assumed that, without the project, these expenditures would have been
made.
5.    Agricultural production did not fall when SCARP tubewells were removed, thanks to
private tubewell investment and O&M. As the impact evaluation surveys have shown, however,
the project's expenditures (installing the electric grid and hookups, improving canals, technical
assistance, and training) had little to do with generating this investment, which occurred at the

same level and speed in similar areas in the absence of a project. Therefore, the same benefits
(stable farm production, no cost from SCARP tubewells) could have been achieved at less cost.

Comments on
(Draft) Impact Evaluation Report:
S'CARP Transition Pilot Project
dated 20 March 1997
1. Institutional Developmenlt
Objective of the Project was "to develop a replicable package of technical and
institutional components."
The Impact Evaluation Report stated "project provisions to foster group ownership were
ineffective" (Exec. summary 17).
Despite this, the Evaluation rated institutional achievement as "fully achieved" (Exec
Summary 15) and "substantial" (p. 16), because the project was intended, not to build but to
destroy the public institution promoting SCARP tubewells (p. 27 fn.).
Then it says that the :idea that WUAs would take over the SCARP tubewells did not work
out (2.1 1).
The Conclusion rated institutional developrnent as "substantial" for a different reason:
"groups of well owners and a market nexus of owners willing to sell water and non owners  OED agrees water
willing to buy it" (7.2). In fact, the Pilot Project did not create water markets, which were there  markets were present
long before the project, and moreover farmers buying and selling water cannot be defined as an  before the project-
see paras. 5.10, 5.1 1,

development means, as their interests were in water technology, agronomy, and economics,
without input of social science.
Probably that is why PPSGWDP has been designed differently, with a heavy component
addressed specifically to institutional development.



Annex B                                 60
2. Group Ownership and Equity
Though the Evaluation says that group ownership is more effective than water markets
(5.17), it says nothing about development or growth of farmer groups. It states that group
ownership promotes 1/3 higher capacity utilization of water, and concludes that the project
therefore promoted equity (4.15). This is largely because the groups consist of small farmers
(having under 5 ha). The mechanism is not shown, except that small farmers are said to be under
more pressure to use their resources more efficiently.
In this respect the Evaluation supports the policy of PPSGWDP to focus on irrigation
needs of small farmers and to pursue equity as an issue.
3. Point of View of Farmers?
The Evaluation states that it "assesses the project's impact from the point of view of the
beneficiaries rather than the government" (1.22).
This is not true because both ERR and institutional development were judged to be  OED disagrees.

developnent was
4. Social, Psychological, and Time Costs of Farmers to Organize                        successful, see
para. 3.8.
The authors of the Evaluation relegated this exceedingly important point to just a
footnote (3.3 fi.), suggesting lack of understanding of the process and costs of forming WUAs.
This has perhaps been corrected in planning PPSGWDP.
5. Over-capacity of Tubewells
The Evaluation found clear evidence that there was over-capacity of private tubewells in
some places, because utilization declined and also price of water was falling below cost (pp. 41-
43).
This may have important implication for PPSGWDP, demand for community tubewells
may not be nearly as much as anticipated in project documents.
6. Water Markets
Earlier studies in Pakistan grossly underestimated or ignored indigenous water
markets-sale of tubewell water, sale/exchange of waranbandi turns, etc. The market rates are 6
to 10, or even 15 times the official rate (p. 59 fii.). The Pilot Project also underestimated it (1.12,  Yes, but this
3.5). The over-capacity of pumps in some places now is affecting the price.             omission was
3.5). The over-capacity of pumps                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~picked up by the
evaluation surveys.
PPSGWDP is taking note of water markets in its Watercourse Assessment Survey, as
part of prioritization for subsidy for tubewells.

7. Lining of Watercourses
The Pilot Project did some lining in 182 watercourses, and collected not 70% as
expected but 36%, and 15 watercourse works were left incomplete.
In view of the poor organizational efforts of the Pilot Project, it is surprising that even
36% was collected from the farmers.
8. Lining of Canals
The Pilot Project lined 32 km of canals. The Evaluation does not say that the farmers             It does. See

12. Cost of Electrification
The Pilot Project invested heavily in dedicated electric lines for pumps. This was        Indian examples quoted
despite IDA finding that in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, etc., the idea that there should be power lines    were implemented at

built.
13. Farmer Income
Incremental income of farmers increased only Rs. 62/ha/year, which is less than inflation
and therefore was a decrease of income, both in project and control areas (4.7, 4.16-17).
This raises the question, whether PPSGWDP can succeed if incremental income will be
so low. The first point is that Impact Evaluation of such a small difference is not likely to be
reliable. The larger point is that PPSGWDP is not viable if justified just by a presumption of
increased income, without institutional and policy changes about wider water management.
Farm prices have been kept depressed not just by irrigation factors but by government
pricing/food control policies, and if increased production and better water management are
expected of Punjab farmers, they may need to get rid of controls and let the market determine
prices, whatever the political cost.
14. Expectation of Shift to High Value Crops
The Pilot Project expected significant shift by farmers to "high value crops" which        OED agrees, but
would justify project costs. But cropping patterns did not change much. There was some shift to impact of the incre-
fodder and vegetables (4.5). This has a benefit not shown in the Evaluation: better nutrition      mental production is
(proteins through milk products and vitamins through vegetables).                                  exceedingly difficult
and fraught with
mnethodological problems.
If increase in fodder and vegetables happens in PPSGWDP, we may consider factoring
in this in project benefits/costs especially if there is a women's component emphasizing these
products.
15. Data collection
The Evaluation data seem to have been collected largely by "enumerators" using            Given the statistical
questionnaires. This resulted in an apparent 8% error in one case (p. 40 fn.) and probably        progras (see para. 1m22)
accounts for numerous others of the statistical uncertainties.                                    questionnaires were
applied to the large
This suggests to PPSGWDP that impact evaluation should not rely so much on                number of randomly
"enumerators" with questionnaires but on fewer and more experienced professionals.                OED reported this
8 percent anomaly
16. Project Served Its Purpose Well?                                                              reasonsoftransparency.
The Evaluation is clear that as regards agricultural production and farmer profit, there
was practically no result from the Project, and that any changes in this respect would have

We would hope that PPSGWDP would have a more forthright evaluation conclusion    7 7
than that!
