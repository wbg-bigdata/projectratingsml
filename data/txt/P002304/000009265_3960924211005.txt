PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        Following is the Project Completion Report  (PCR)  for the
Senegal Second Aviation Project for which Loan 1665-SE for US$7.0 m was
approved on March 13, 1979. The loan was signed on April 14, 1979 and
became effective on Novemtar 15, 1979.  The original closing date of
December 31, 1982 was postponed by one year to allow time for extra
works. Final disbursements were completed on May 11, 1984, and the
balance of the loan cancelled.
2.        This report consists of a PCR prepared by the Borrower which
covers project implementation and a Supplementary PCR prepared by the
Western Africa Region which covers especially the financial and institu-
tional performances and the econonic reevaluation. Data for the Supple-
mentary PCR were mostly collected during supervision missions for other
projects and obtained from the Bank's files.
3.       In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The
draft Completion Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however,
none were received.

REPUBLIC PF SENEGAL
SECOND AVIATION PROJECT, LOAN 1665-SE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Under this project, the Bank assisted Senegal in financing of
strengthening of the main runway and taxiway at Dakar airport, procure-
ment of navigational equipment for two local airports and miscellaneous
smaller airport improvements. The main part of the project aimed at
assuring that Dakar airport could continue to handle B 747s and DC. lOs
in transit to South America without having to introduce payload penal-
ties.
2.        The project was only partially successful.  Physical implemen-
tation did not pose any particular problems but the main use for which
it was intended has changed. Virtually all flights from Europe to South
America now bypass Dakar but large jets on flights from various parts of
Africa to North America use Dakar for transit stops to North America.
The total number of transit stops by large aircraft on transatlantic
flights, however,  is about 50  of the SAR forecast.   Institutional
improvements under the project which aimed at better financial manage-
ment have not been successful.
3.        Points of special interest are:
(a) the project illustrates the difficulties in forecasting
airport use (para 3.02-3.04);
(b) more judicious management could increase the airport'  effi-
ciency and decrease the need for additional investments
(para 2.03, 5.01);
(c) as a result of much lower than forecast traffic, the economic
return is only 10% instead of 37% forecast (para 3.10); and
(d) financial management needs strengthening (para 5.02).

WORLD BANK LOAN 1665-SE: SECOND AVIATION PROJECT
COMPLETION REPORT
ASECNA
-       I.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1.1       Definition of Project
As the name suggests, the purpose of the Second Aviation Project was
to upgrade the services provided for the many foreign airlines using
Dakaz-Yoff Airport, with a particular view to maintaining Dakar's appeal for
international air traffic and also modernizing the navigation equipment at the
two busiest airport.s in the interior of Senegal, Cap Skirring and Ziguinchor.
1.2       Original Components
At appraisal, the main components were as follows:
Dakar-Yoff:
- strengthening the main runway (01-19);
- improving drainage and strengthening the taxiway;
- realigning the taxiway and the runway.
Ziguinchor Airport:
- installing additional equipment (navigation and landing aids).
Cap Skirring Airport:
- installing VASIS equipment.
The Proiect Overall:
- ASECNA's stpervising of studies and it monitoring function.
1.3       Modifications to the Investmen. Plan
The original investment plan for the Project was modified for the
following reasons:
-    the bids submitted for strengthening the runway at Dakar-Yoff
Airport were unexpectedly -- and gratifyingly -- lower than the appraisal
estimates;
-    the US$/CFAF exchange rate has changed enormously.
As a result, ASECNA proposed upgrading Dakar-Yoff Airport, and these
works were included in the Project.
1.4       Financing
The Project was financed jointly by the World Bank and the
Senegalese Government, in the following proportions:



PART A
-2 -                          Page 2 of 38
-    US$7 million, under Loan Agreement 1665-SE of April 18, 1979 between
the World Bank and Senegal;
-    CFAF 500 million, allocated by the Senegalese Government from the
special account established for investment expenditures.
1.5       Planning
Work began virtually on schedule.
1.6       Performance of the Contractors
The technical performance of the contractors participating in
project execution was good. However, certain deadlines were not met and
penalties for time overruns were imposed on the Senegalese company responsible
for extending the air terminal.
1.7       Performance of ASECNA
ASECNA's studies, supervision and monitoring of the Project were
satisfactory, and were mainly exeeuted by Senegalese engineers and experts.
The Project enabled them to acquire valuable training and experience.
1.8       Project Cost
As indicated in 1.3, project cost was lower than the appraisal
estimates. A third application for additional works was only partly approved
by the World Bank. Approval of all components in the application would have
absorbed the entire loan funds, so a balance is left of about US$1 million.
1.9       Changes in Traffic
Passenger traffic has in fact risen (by 3.9Z from 1980 to 1981, and
by 8.62 from 1981 to 1982), but not to the extent predicted (an average
increase of 122).
Similarly, freight traffic has risen modestly, at an average rate of
2.52 until 1982, instead of the projected 13%.
In contrast, and against all expectations, aircraft movements have
declined at an average rate of 6.8%, for the following reasons:
-    between 1980 and 1981, all companies withdrew their transit flights
between Europe and South America;
-   certain services were withdrawn (e.g. Concorde);
-    contrary to expectations, no new companies began to serve the
Europe-Dakar routes;
-    certain jumbo services ceased to operate after the transit flights
were withdrawn.

1.10      Justification for World Bank Participation
World Bank participation was justified because the Project provided
increased security-and safety.
In addition, operations were improved, providing a source of
additional revenue for Dakar-Yoff Airport, which, like Cap Skirring and
Ziguinchor, has increased airport tax rates for passengers.
II. GENERAL DATA
2.1       Negotiations
Accompanied by members of ASECNA (the executing agency), Senegalese
Government representatives submitted an application for project financing to
the World Bank as part of the negotiations held in Paris from January 31 to
February 2, 1979. The World Bank approved the loan in March 1979.
2.2       Project Preparation
The project was prepared by ASECNA using studies made by the agency
itself and examined by World Bank staff. These studies showed that the runway
- built in 1958/59 using Portland cement concrete - was showing clear signs
of failure, with considerable cracking due to the excessive stress imposed by
the use of heavier aircraft and a steady increase in the number of movements.
The Government and ASECNA had to take action to solve this problem.
Two courses were open: either to reduce takeoff weights, or to strengthen the
pavement to take traffic at full loads. The laettr option would avoid the
disadvantages that the former would create for the Senegalese economy in
general and airport operations in particular (especially through the direct
loss of revenue and jobs).
2.3       The Executing Agency and its Structure
The executing agency for the Second Aviation Project was ASECNA
(Agence pour la Securite de la Navigation Aerienne en Afrique et a
Madagascar), established by the Convention of St. Louis (December 12, 1959),
signed by France and 14 African states, including Senegal. It has two main
functions:
-    international functions, governed by Article 2 of the Gonvention;
-    domestic functions, governed by Articles 10 and 12 of the Convention.
ASECNA is currently financed and directed by the African states,
with African personnel assisted by a small number of specia.ists from French
Technical Assistance.
A committee of ministers responsible for air transportation in the
member states lays down the broad lines of policy for ASECNA. A President and
an Administrative Council, made up of ministerial delegates, are responsible
for administration, while the Director General, assisted by experts drawm from
the various states, is responsible for the day-to-day running of activities.

Page 4 of 38
ASECNA headquarters is in Dakar, but it is represented in each
member country by an agent appointed by the President of the Council.
ASECNA is well organized, and the staff is competent and effective.
It has technical training schools in Niger, Senegal and Cameroon.
ASECNA also acted as executing agency for the World Bank's First
Senegal Aviation Project and for the First Niger Aviation Project, under
special contracts with Senegal and Niger respectively. The execution of these
projects was satisfactory in all respects.
Dakar-.'off Airport, together with Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring
Airports, are managed and operated by ASECNA on behalf of the Senegalese
Government.
Because of the organization's experience and high quality, no funds
were allocated for training, management studies or any other form of
assistance.
2.4       Survey of Civil Aviation in Senegal
Civil aviation in Senegal is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Equipment and of ASECNA. The Ministry carries out its responsibilities
through the Directorate of Civil Aviation (DAC) in the Directorate General of
Transportation.
DAC approves and supervises the operations of the state-owned
airline, Air Sen6gal, which provides regular internal services and a limited
range of international services. The two busiest routes are the ones
connecting Dakar with Cap Skirring (271 km), a very important tourist resort,
and with Ziguinchor (275 km), Senegal's third-largest city.
Senegal has a network of 16 airports open to public traffic and
these have served to interconnect all the regions of the country and provide
transportation to areas of interest to tourists.
This network comprises one international airport (Dakar-Yoff) and 15
secondary airports, the most important of these being Ziguinchor, Cap
Skirring, Saint Louis and Tambacounda.
In addition, there are 25 private airfields.
In Senegal, the ASECNA staff numbers 893, comprising 556 employed
under Article 2 and 337 under Article 10.
2.5       Changes in Traffic at Dakar-Yoff, Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring
From 1979 (the date of project appraisal) to 1982, commercial
traffic developed as follows:

Similarly, freight rose by an average rate of only 2.52 until 1982,
instead of the projected 13%.

In addition, aircraft movements declined at an average rate of 6.8%
until 1982, whereas a 6S increase had been expected.
The wide discrepancies between the projections and the actual
figures for traffic show that the projections were overoptimistic, and the
forecasting system must be changed before being applied to other projects.
However, these discrepancies do not necessarily mean imply that
Senegal will not receive a return on the Project, provided that ASECNA
fulfills all its obligations.
2.7       Possible Explanation of Discrepancies
According to information obtained from certain airlines operating in
Dakar, the explanation for the shortfall in aircraft movements is that certain
of them (i.e. Lufthansa and Air France) no longer use it as a stopover when
flying to South America, whereas transit flights had been expected to remain
at a constant level. This has also had an impact on airport revenue,
particularly as regards landing fees.
The reduction is also reflected in the two airlines' statistics for
stopovers by type of aircraft, as shown in the table below.
Lufthansa
Type of aircraft                             707
Year                      DC10 & 747    Passengers & freight         Total
1980                           110                 222                 332
1981                            10                 165                 175

It should be noted that in May 1980 Lufthansa withdrew transit
flights to South America using jumbos.

Air France withdrew 747 transit flights to South America in April
1981, and Concorde in 1982.  The increase in 747 stopovers in 1983 was because
Air France was selected for the hajj.

Nevertheless, the movements of other airlines' jumbos have remained
constant (i.e. Swissair: four DC10 movements per week; Pan-Am: two 747
movements per week; Nigeria Airways: two DC10 movements per week, not
counting freight).
It should be noted that, in spite of all these shortfalls, the
expansion of tourism in Senegal has increased passenger traffic at Dark-Yotf,
Cap Skirring and Ziguinchor.
The following statistics for arrivals of nonresident tourists
reflect this trend:

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
3.1       Project Components:  Description and Estimates
3.1.1.    General
The purpose of the Second Aviation Project was to carry out works
for improving safety, security and operations at Dakar-Yoff International
Airport and che secondary airports at Zinguinchor and Cap Skirring, in
accordance with the standards set by ICAO and called for in the ASECNA audit.
The World Bank loan to the Republic of Senegal, onlent to ASECNA,
totaled US$7 million equivalent in various currencies, with a Senegalese
participation of CFAF 500 million. These funds, and their repayment, are
administered exclusively through the Senegales special account.
Originally, the breakdown of financing was as indicated in (2.8)
above.
3.1.2.    Agreements and Contracts
The following served as instruments for ratifying and implementing
the Project:
-    Loan Agreement No. 1665-SE between the Republic of Senegal and the
World Bank (April 18, 1979);
-    Project Agreement No. 1665-SE between ASECNA and the World Bank
(April 18, 1979);
-    Special Contract No. 210/C/I/FM between the Republic of Senegal and
ASECNA (July 2, 1979);
-    Amendment No. 1 to Special Contract No. 210/C/l/F!4 (August 16, 1979);
-    Amendment No. 2 to Special Contract No. 210/C/l/FM (June 24, 1982);
-    Letter No. 3512/ME/ASECNA (November 5, 1983) notifying ASECNA of the
postponement of the closing date for the loan from December 31, 1983
to March 31, 1984, and constituting Amendment No. 3 to the Special
Contract.

3.1.3.    Original Project Components and Estimates (in millions of CFAF)
Modifications were made to the program of investment as defined in
the Loan and Project Agreements and the original Special Contract.
The reasons for these modifications were as follows:
-    The bids for strengthening the runway at Dakar Airport were
unexpectedly - and gratifyingly -- lower than the appraisal
estimates (see 3.3).
It thus became clear that a considerable part of the loan amount
would not be needed for financing the Project as originally
defined. Application was made to the World Bank for approval for
additional works. This was granted on the first occasion (Amendment
No. 2) through a Bank supervision mission that spent from February
11 to 18, 1980 in Senegal.
-    The US$ rose from the equivalent of CFAF 220 at the time of
appraisal to OFAF 350 in March 1983 and CFAF 395 in October 1983, an
increase of 79.5%, contrasting with the decline in the exchange rate
for the US$ that occurred during the First Aviation Project.

3.1.4     Description of Project Operations
A.   Dakar-Yoff
1.   Strenathening of Runway 01-19 and Taxiway
Strengthening the runway and the main taxiway consisted of the
following:
-    thoroughly cleaning the surfaces (3,500 m long and 45 m wide);
-    supplying and laying a tack coat of cationic bituminous emulsion
(0.800 kg of residual binder per ml);
-    supplying and laying a binder course of dense-coated material of
thickness ranging from 0.09 m to 0.03 m over a width of 36 m
(runway) and 15 m (taxiway);
-    where necessary, laying a tack coat (0.500 kg of residual binder per
n);
-    supplying and laying an asphaltic concrete wearing course ranging in
thickness from 0.06 m to 0.02 m over the whole width of the runway
and taxiway.
2.   Strengthening of Night Parking Space
Similar materials were used for the parking space, but with a
thickness of 0.06 m over the entire surface (emulsion and asphaltic concrete).
3.   Alignment of the Taxiway and Runway (Construction of a New
Connecting Taxiway)
This entailed the following work:
-    Clearing scrub, removing roots, and scraping topsoil from the whole
area concerned;
-    carrying out earthwork for profiling edges and formation level of
the pavement (cuttings and embankments), and compacting the
formation level to 952 of OPM;*
-    laying a base of crushed basalt sand 0.02 m thick after compaction;
-    spreading layers of ungraded basalt (0/50 and 0/31.5) in thickinesses
of 0.30 m and 0.20 m respectively;
* Abbreviation not identified (Tr.)

Page 13 of 38
-    application of a liquefied bitumen penetrating binder
(1.5 kg per m)
-    spreading a 0.10-! layer of bitumen-stabilized ungraded basalt
(0/31.5);
-    laying a bituminous emulsion tack coat (0.500 kg of binder per m2);
-    applying a layer of dense-coated material 0.10 m thick after
compaction;
-    layiny a bituminous emulsion tack coat (0.500 kg of residual binder
per m );
-    putting in an asphaltic concrete course 0.06 m thick after
compaction;
-    constructing antiblast edges using laterite for a 0.22-m thick base
course and impregnation with liquefied bitumen at 1.5 kg per ma,
and a layer of sand asphalt 0.03 m thick after compaction;
-    digging drainage ditches;
-    laying 125 diameter conduits in 35-m lengths under the taxiway,
together with various other works;
-    installing day lighting.
4.   Extension of the Terminal, and Installation of Security Devices
(First Phase)
The extension of passenger areas in the Dakar-Yoff terminal was
considered necessary because of the steady increase in passenger traffic, both
arrivals and departures. Problems of saturation and congestion had soon made
themselves felt.
Security problems have arisen everywhere in the field of civil
aviation, and Dakar-Yoff is no exception.
However, the extension as it currently exists constitutes only the
first phase of a project which will include a third departure lounge,
additional parking space for jumbos and boarding bridges.
The works consist of the following:
-    provision of two separate lounges, with strictly controlled access,
for assembling departing passengers;
-    installing two electronic units for examining hand luggage and
detecting metal objects.
The two lounges have the following specifications:

- 14 _                      inPage 14 of 38
Lounae 1
360 m2, with sufficient capacity to accommodate all passengers
departing on a medium-large aircraft (e.g. Airbus, DC10, DC8 63, etc.).
Lounge 2
480 m2, with sufficient capacity to accommodate all passengers
traveling on the largest aircraft (747, "stretched" DC10, etc.). It may also
be temporarily partitioned to accommodate passengers traveling on
lower-capacity aircraft.
The two lounges are provided with restrooms, telephones, public
address systems and clocks. They are served by two separate central air
conditioning systems, and include an open-air section serving as a patio.
The construction consists of a metal framework with reinforced
concrete pillars, a roof constructed of welded integral preforred steel
sections, with parapet of enameled aluminium panels, and aluminum/wood walls
fitted with tempered glass windows.
5.  Rehabilitation of Runway Lighting (Without Approach)
and 5.5-kV Power System
The works comprised installation of a high-intensity lignting system
and the necessary upgrading of the power and telecontrol systems.
They consisted of the following items:
-    Installation of electrical equipment for transformers K, S, L and M,
and construction and installation of a new transformer (C);
-    installation of lighting (edge markings for runway, taxiway and
parking spaces);
-    remote control of this lighting from the control tower, and
telecontrol of all electrical equipment from the generator;
-    installation of cables, with all necessary trenches and other works
(conduits, crossings, etc.);
-    dismantling and storage of equipment and material removed and not
reused in the new installations.
6.   Fuel-Resistant Surfacing for Night Parking Space
This consisted of preparing the surface of the Dakar-Yoff night
parking space and covering it with a layer of coated bituminous material in
order to protect it from the fuel leaking from the many aircraft parked there
for extended periods.



-15 -                          PART A
Page 15 of 38
The main stages were as follows:
-    restQring the areas, after breaking, excavation and removal of
material; with 0.18 dense-coated material;
-    supplying and spreading three fuel-resistant dressings (1 kg of
residual material per m:);
-    replacing the day marking.
7.   Lighting for the Night Parking Space
Installation of this lighting was in line with the recommendations
contained in ICAO Annex 14, providing for increased security and improved
surveillance of parked aircraft.
The works consisted of the supply and installation of the following:
-    5 lighting towers fitted with 9 floodlights and 5 hazard markers,
together with an isolating transformer;
-    power cables and telecontrol;
-    I switch box;
-    1 remote control/telecontrol panel installed in the control tower;
-    various devices for connecting the control panel to the general
monitoring devices in the control tower;
-    1 low-tension cubicle to power the floodlights and equipped with
protection devices and feeders.
B.   Ziguinchor
Ziguinchor is one of the most important economic centers in the
Casamance region, and its airport was expected to play an increasingly
significant role in its development by providing a link with Dakar, since, for
political, economic, administrative and developmental reasons, efficient
communications are essential for this comparatively isolated region. However,
the airport's location presented certain problems, so it was decided that
investment, while necessary, should be limited until the position was
clarified. This part of the project was to consist of the following
components:
1.   VOR and VASIS Navigation Aids
-    Purchase and installation of VOR equipment;
-    purchase and installation of VASIS equipment to ensure safe and
trouble-free night landings.



PART A
Page 16 of 38
2.   Runway Lighting
This consisted of installing a medium-intensity runway edge light
system, to serve also as a night marking system.
3.   Emergency Power Plant
The new emergency power plant replaces tbe former one, which was old
and located in the city. It provides an increased power supply to the
airport.
It consists of the following:
-    1 single-story building (9.64 m x 7.46 m) with a reinforced concrete
frame, masonry walls, and a flat roof. It is divided into the
following areas: a generating room with space for two sets; a WC; a
control room;
-    two 50-kV generator sets and related switchgear.
C.   Cap Skirring Airport
The purpose in this case was to increase night-flight capacity.
Such flights to and from Dakar have become increasingly important to this
tourist center, because they provide direct connections with European flights
and obviate the need for providing stopover accommodation in Dakar. The
Government had installed runway lighting in 1978/79, and so the components
relating to this airport consisted of supplying VASIS equipment and
constructing an emergency generating facility practically identical to the one
in Ziguinchor, together with one network with backup, a network without
backup, and automatic control for the generator.
D.   Audit Program
The process of project appraisal had revealed the need for* auditing,
since the ASECNA accounting system had been unable to provide the financial
statements necessary for comparing the progress made with the financial
objectives of the Project. Moreover, ASECNA itself was aware of the system's
inadequacies, and had initiated a long-term project for reforming and
modernizing it. However, since the accounting reform committee had been
unable to produce results before project completion, it was unanimously agreed
to call on consultants to establish a system for drawing up accounts and
financial reports relating specifically to ASECNA operations in Senegal, but
applicable to all of the Agency's operations.

3.3.      Procurement
Procurement was carried out in compliance with the guidelines
contained in the Loan and Project Agreements.  International competitive
bidding (open to all IBRD member countries and Switzerland), followed by calls
for bids from prequalified bidders, was used for all civil works and for the
main runway lighting and rehabilitation of the 5.5-kV system. Special
procedures, approved in each case by the World Bank, were employed for certain
works costing less than US$100,000.
The results of the bidding were as follows:
1.   Strengthening of Runway, Taxiway and Night Parking Space;
Construction of New Taxiway

Bids 2 and 4 were disqualified for the following reasons:
-    Within the Group, the Italian company met the requirements but the
Senegalese company did not
-    The company was not big enough to handle the works; its turnover was
small, and the equipment it proposed to use was inadequate both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
Bids from Entreprises Ch6rifiennes de Travaux Africains (Morocco)
and Jean Lefebvre (France) were received after the deadline and were returned
to them unopened, in accordance with Article 10 of the Invitation to Bid.

SEEE was selected because the other two companies underestimated
very considerably the cost of supplying the main cables and quoted longer
times.
3.   Extension of Dakar-Yoff Air Terminal (Civil Works)

four applications were received by the deadline. These were from the
following firms:

Batisse was selected because IDE's bid contained certain omissions
and its final cost would have been higher.
4.   Generator Building at Ziguinchor (Civil Works)
In this case, prequalificatica was not used because the estimated
cost was less than US$100,000.
The following bids were received:
(         :                            :  Amount of Bid   : Time Required   )

Donze et Cie. was selected because of its low quotation and its long
experience in carryin.g out similar work for ASECNA.
5.   Generator at Building at Cap Skirring (Civil Works)

used.

CFAF 19,918,861, with the work to be completed in four months.
This company was selected.
6.   GeneratinR Equipment for Ziguinchor
The limited call for quotations produced the following bids:

The contract was awarded to CFCD, but during execution -- and after
supplying the generators and related equipment - the company became insolvent
and a specialized firm had to be found for the installation work. ASECNA

3,786,000 not subject to adjustment.

10.  Fuel-Resistant Surfacing for the Night Parking Space at Dakar-Yoff
An initial call for quotations produced the following two bids
(February 1963):
-    Jean Lefebvre (Senegal):  CFAF 23,625,000 (taxes included)
-    Colas (West Atrica):       CFAF 11,760,000 (taxes included)
When these works were approved by the World Bank, tte updated
quotations (as of October 1983) were as follows:
-    Jean Lefebvre:   CFAF 22,892,500 (excluding taxes as.d duties);
4 months
-    Colas:            CFAF 16,584,000 (excluding taxes asd duties);
4 months
The contract was awarded to Colas.
3.4.      Design and supervision of works
The designs work was done by ASECNA on behalf of the Senegalese
Government. The World Bank examined the plans and bidding documents and
approved them in virtually every respect.
In addition, ASECNA supervised all construction works and was
represented on site by qualified Senegalese engineers and other experts,
supervised in their turn by the Directorate General in Dakar.
3.5.      Constructiot
In general, there were few construction problems.
The Dakar-Yoff, Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring airports continued to
operate throughout the Project and the work was arranged to itterfere as
little as possible with traffic.
All the works were executed by companies selected according to the
correct procedures and supervised by Senegalese engineers and other experts.
3.6.      Proiect Cost Compared with Appraisal Estimate
In general, and except for the strengthening of the runway (for
which Colas has presented a claim for CFAF 102 million, costs were strictly
controlled by the executing agency, the additional works were justified, and
price revisions were of an appropriate scale. The following table details the
costs, and the possible division of these between the World Bank and Senegal
(in thousands of CFAF and US$).  The conversion rate adopted is US$1 l
CFAF 395.

If physical and price contingencies are excluded, therefore, this
comparison shows that, In general, costs were overestimated. This Is a vise
precaution in any appraisal, and in this case it made it possible for ASECNA
to carry out additional works.

The considerable difference between the original and actual
disbursement schedules was caused by the addition of works to the
original investment plan and the two postponements of the closing dates
(to December 31, 1983 and March 31, 1984).
IV. MAIN PROBLEMS ENCOUTERED DURING PROJECT EXECtUTION
Certain problems were encountered during project executlon and
these led both to time overruns and to disputes beteeen the executing
agency and the contractors, increasing costs in both cases. These
?roblems are detailed below.
4.1       Strentthenina of Main Runway, Taxiway and Night Parkint Space;
Construction of New Taxiway
The problems were caused exclusively by the rains, which resulted in
both an abnormally high consumption of diesel fuel by the coating plant and,
at times, interruption of work when the water content of aggregates or in the
various courses rose above the permissible limit.
The rain and its consequences led to a claim for additional payment
totaling CFAF 102 million from the contractor (Colas). This has produced
several exchanges of correspondence presenting explanations and arguments.
However, in future such problems must be avoided by carrying out
asphalt laying during the appropriate season.
4.2       The Power Plant Buildinas at Ziauinchor and Cap Skirrins
The problems encountered during the construction of these buildings,
and which led to interruptions of the works, were caused by occasional holdups
of materials and equipment by Customs as a result of the procedures for
exempting such items from import duty. This led to considerable delays in the
works, as can be seen from the execution schedule.
4.3       Equipment for the Ziguinchor Power-Plant
Iti addition to the problems caused by the procedures for exemption
from import duty, the first contractor went bankrupt after having supplied the
generators.
The executing agency then took emergency action and awarded a direct
contract for installing the generators to another company. This procedure was
approved by the World Bank.
4.4       Equipment for the Cap Skirring Power Plant
Problems of customs clearance and exemption from import duty caused
considerable delays, and the Senegal Office of ASECNA had to intervene on
several occasions. Work was sometimes interrupted in this case also, with the
inevitable consequences.

Page 6 of 38
4.5       Extension of Dakar-Yoff Air Terminal
tn this case there was a five-month overrun due both to the slow
procedures for obtaining exemption from import duty and also to the fact that
the tempered glass ordered from France to replace the type originally planned
did not arrive until the end of April.
It was decided during execution of the works -- and with World Bank
approval - to request that the glass be tempered, because this would probably
provide improved insulation. The process was not completed until the end of
April.
However, after examining where responsibility lay for this overrun,
and with due regard for the problems caused by both the exemption procedures
and the tempering process, the executing agency imposed a 46-day delay penalty
on the company.
The tempering also increased execution costs, which were much higher
than projected.
4.6       Other Works
As regards the other operations -- and especially the works added to
the original investment plan -- the obtaining of exemption from turnover tax
has been a particular problem. Although this has not been completely solved,
progress is being made. The additional works were particularly affected.
4.7       Recommendations
In general, and aside from unforeseen problems and miscellaneous
difficulties, the procedures for obtaining exemption from import duty on
materials and equipment and from turnover tax posed serious problems, in spite
of Article 8 of the Special Contract between the Republic of Senegal and
ASECNA, which stipulated that all works related to the Project would be exempt.
In future projects, therefore, there should be close cooperation
with the Ministry of Finance, and particularly with the Directorate.General of
Taxes, in order to draw up an effective and simplified exemption system.
V. DEGREE TO WHICH C"MMITMENTS WERE FULFILLED
The Loan and Project Agreements specified objectives to be achieved
through a series of undertakings.  The degree to which these were fulfilled
will be exanmined below.
5.1       Increases in Passenger Revenue at Dakar and Other Airports
This measure was intended to contribute to the rate of return on
project investment.
As of November 1, 1983, a presidential decree raised airport taxes
to the following levels:
(a)  Domestic flights:                 CFAF 1,100 per passenger
(b)  Flights within the Region:        CFAF 2,500 per passenger
(c)  International flights:            CFAF 3,500 per passenger
However, implementation of this measure was somewhat delayed.

Page 37 of 38
5.2       Recovery of Arrears from Major :Clients
In this case, the aim of the Senegal Office of ASECNA was to improve
the financial pofsition for domestic operations by collecting a considerable
proportion of the excessively large arrears owed by clients.
An energetic collection policy has been implemented, that even
provides for coercive measures if needed. A five-member National Collection
Committee has been established and is expected to achieve satisfactory results.
5.3       Follow-up to Auditors' Recommendations
The auditors' recommendations are being studied, and the Directorate
General of ASECNA is soon to issue instructions regarding measures for
implementing them.
The principle has been accepted that such audits will be carried out
in future years so as to provide guidance for the agency's accounting and
procedural reforms.
5.4       Reduction in Personnel Costs (Article 10)
This reduction will be brought about because Article 10 personnel
costs include items that would normally be included in the Community budget.
This measure was applied on January 1, 1984, and will definitely
reduce the cost of ASECNA's activities in Senegal.
VI. BASIS FOR A THIRD AVIATION PROJECT
In their constant desire to improve operations and security at
Dakar-Yoff International Airport and the main secondary airports, the
Government and the Senegal Office of ASECNA intend to make a further
application to the World Bank for financing certain operations that Senegal
regards as priorities. The following is a summary of these operations.
6.1       Second Phase of Extension to the Dakar-Yoff Terminal
This second phase would consist of the following works:
-    construction of a third departure lounge;
-    establishment of close parking spaces for jumbos;
-    construction of boarding bridges;
-    alterations to the passenger arrival lounge and baggage reception
area by extending it along the side of the service area.
6.2       Enclosure of Cap Skirring Airport
The purpose would be both to provide protection against the danger
of persons, vehicles and stray animals crossing the runway, and also to
protect the existing installations, which were partly financed under the



-38-                           PART A
Page 38 of 38
Second Aviation Project (i.e. certain navigation aids and the emergency power
plant).
6.3       Enclosure of Ziauinchor Airport
This is a necessary priority for the reasons stated in (6.2), an
additional reason being the uncontrolled construction of housing in the
immediate vicinity of the airport.
6.4       Rehabilitation of Runways at Cap Skirring and Zipuinchor
The dimensions of the existing paved areas are by now too small to
cope with the increases in traffic and the wear due to the use of increasingly
heavier aircraft as a result of the developoent of tourism in these areas.
Currently, they show signs of failure and wear, such as considerable
subsidence and large cracks. This could jeopardize the development of tourism
in lower Casamance, with all the harmful repercussions that this could have
for the Senegalese economy.

SECOND AVIATION PROJECT, LOAN 1665-SE
SUPPLEMENTARY PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. THE PROJECT
1.01      The Senegal Second Aviation Project comprised the second stage
of a phased improvement of Dakar Yoff International Airport (Dakar
Airport) and improvements to the airports of Ziguinchor and Cap Skir-
ring. JFhe first project, which was successfully completed, 1/ covered
the extension of the main runway, extension of aircraft parking aprons
and related works. The Second Project covered the following items:
(a) strengthening and levelling the main runway and taxiway and
improving the taxiway alignment at Dakar airport;
(b) installation of navigation aids (VOR), runway lighting and
related works at Ziguinchor; and
Cc) installation of visual approach aids at Cap Skirring (VASIS).
The project was supported by a World Bank loan for US$7.0 m.
1.02      Airports in Senegal are owned by the Government and most are
operated by the Agence pour la Securitg de la Navigation Aerienne en
Afrique et a Madagascar (ASECNA), which is an international agency with
a membership of 14 African countries. Originally, France was directly
involved in ASECNA, but it now plays only a limited role. ASECNA's main
tasks are:  (a) to control air navigation over the territories of the
African member states under Article 2 of the Convention; and (b) to
design, construct, manage and operate ground facilities of member
states' airports in accordance with Articles 10 and 12 of the Convention
and under bilateral agreements (Contrats Particuliers) between individu-
al member states and ASECNA. ASECNA's headquarters are in Dakar.
1.03      ASECNA is in charge of management, operation and maintenance
of Dakar Airport and of most of Senegal's domestic airports under a
"tContrat Particulier" with the Government of Senegal.  The concession
for Aircraft handling has been given to Air France and Air Afrique. The
Ministry of Equipment controls landing rights and schedules, and landing
and other fees at the airports.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
2.01      The civil works at Dakar Airport were contracted in accordance
with  the Bank's procedures.   The contract was awarded  to a French
consortium at a price about 50% below the appraisal estimate. Construc-
tion work was successfully completed. Civil works for Ziguinchor and
Cap Skirring were awarded under LCB to a Senegalese contractor and the
work was of satisfactory quality.
2.02      Because of low bid prices and exchange fluctuations, substan-
tial loan funds remained available. At the request of the Borrower,
several items were then added to the project. These included provision
at Dakar airport for additional passenger waiting space, security
monitoring equipment in the terminal building, replacement of runway
lighting and electrical distribution systems and a jet seal at the night
parking area. These additions required a 15 months' extension of the
closing date. This work was also satisfactorily completed. Details on
the physical implemetitation of the project are described in the Bor-
rower's Project Completion Report.
2.03      At the time of appraisal, the technical and organizational
management of the airport were judged satisfactory and the project did
not include assistance for strengthening the organization, but, in
recent years, there has been growing evidence that improved organization
could benefit the airport's efficiency. rthe project did include several
covenants aimed at improved financial management, an aspect which has
met with very little success as can be seen in Chapter IV below.
III. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
3.01      At the time of the arpraisal, it was estimated that, without
resurfacing of the runway, weight restrictions would have to be intro-
duced for the Concorde, Boeing 747s, and DC lOs, which would have caused
these aircraft to cease using Dakar for transatlantic flights.  Four
types of benefits were quantified:
(a) revenues from landing charges;
(b) expenditures by the crews stopping over in Dakar;
(c) sale of aviation fuel; and
(d)  sale of airport-related services (catering, duty-free shop).
3.02      Since the start of the project, air traffic patterns have
changed  considerably.   Although  flights  were  already  going  direct
between Europe and South America, according to the SAR, transit traffic
via Dakar to and from South America was still increasing. However, this



- 41                            PART B
Page 3 of 8
pattern changed and the last passenger services between Europe and South
America stopped using Dakar in 1983. A substantial part of the benefits
anticipated at the time of appraisal, therefore, has ceased to accrue to
the project. The losses are partially compensated by the introduction
of B 747s and DC 109 on the Dakar-New York route, which without the
project, might not have happened. Moreover, a number of cargo flights
to and from South America are still stopping in Dakar. In addition to
the transatlantic flights, Dakar airport is used by some Boeing 747 and
DC 10 flights connecting Senegal with other African countries and
Europe, but the appraisal judged that these flights, because of the
shorter distances, would not be affected by a possible payload penalty
if the project had not been done. On the other band, strengthening of
the Dakar runway has allowed continued operations of the regular sched-
uled flights from Europe to Senegal with DC 10s and Airbuses, and
contributed thereby, among other things, to the smooth development of
tourism in Senegal.
3.03      Some  unexpected  benefits  have  resulted  from  the project.
These included the use of Dakar Airport by NASA as an emergency landing
site for space shuttles.  The number of service flights involved was
small and overall benefits for the project can not be quantified. For a
period, Dakar has also benefitted from British military air traffic.
Only part of this traffic consisted of very heavy aircraft which would
not have been able to take off fully loaded if the runway had not been
strengthened.   However,  if the heaviest planes could not have been
accommodated, it appears that for logistic reasons, much of the other
traffic would also have gone elsewhere.   Benefits from the military
traffic are not clearly identified in ASECNA's accounting system.
3.04      Civilian  transatlantic  traffic using Dakar  Airport  varies
between months, because when demand is limited, cargo carriers use
smaller  aircraft.   Furthermore,  some  flights  (Nigerian Airways  and
Aeroflot) only land for refueling when they are fully loaded but other-
wise overfly Dakar.   Following are the scheduled  landings by large
civilian aircraft in transatlantic service, compared with the appraisal
estimates.

3.05      Revenues fron landing charges generated by transatlantic B 747
and DC 10 flights accounted for more than 53% of the project's benefits
in the staff appraisal report.  The proiect completion reDort has used
the same methodology as in the staff appraisal report even though there



- 42 -                           PART B
Page 4 of 8
can be different interpretations.  The benefits used in the PCR are the
landing charges collected by ASECNA from the scheduled transatlantic
flights, including refueling stops by Nigerian Airways.  In addition,
some revenues from military traffic were included, using the limited
statistical data available on military landings and estimates for the
size of aircraft. The Staff Appraisal Report did not include passenger
departure fees as a benefit. No statistics per flight are available,
but the revenues would be small because only a few passengers board in
Dakar for transatlantic flights.
3.06      Benefits from crew stopovers, which in the staff appraisal
report accounted . for 16% of total benefits, have declined very substan-
tially. This is caused not only by the reduced number of transatlantic
flights, but also by the larger percentage of cargo planes and the fact
that most of the passenger flights do not change crews at Dakar or
change only the cockpit crew.   Some benefits were included for the
foreign staff staying in Dakar as a result of military traffic referred
to in para 3.03 above.
3.07      The project completion report assumes that no benefits accrue
to the project from the sale of aviation fuel. Added value from fuel
sales accounted for 23% of project benefits in the staff appraisal
report  (aviation fuel for international flights is not taxed).   The
reason for not considering these benefits is the uncertainty about any
added value from fuel sales accruing to Senegal.  In the late 1970s,
some jet fuel and diesel had to be imported because the local refinery
could not cope with the strong demand. Subsequently, the refinery was
expanded, but recently the refinery closed because it proved cheaper to
import refined products.
3.08      Benefits from duty-free sales and airport restaurants account-
ed for 8% of total benefits in the appraisal. No benefits are consid-
ered in the project completion report, because many of the transit
flights stop in Dakar in the middle of the night, the airport shops have
been poorly managed and a substantial part of the rental for shops is
overdue and part of the amount may have to be written off.
3.09      The project completion report has, however, considered bene-
fits from airport handling. Precise data are not available because each
contract is negotiated separately and usually, the rates charged are
lower than the official tariff. The project completion report has based
its estimates on data which were informally provided by airlines.  It
has been estimated that the added value is 25% of the rates charged.
3.10      Based on the assumptions explained above, the project comple-
tion report has found a reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) of 10%
for Dakar Airport and 9% for the entire investment.  If, starting in
1980, benefits would decrease by 20%, the ERR will be reduced to 8% and
7%, respectively (details in Table 1).  The reestimated economic ERR is
on the conservative side because some benefits such as avoided increases
in runway maintenance costs and some passenger terminal charges could



- 43-                            PART B
Page 5 of 8
not be quantified. If it were to be assumed that the expansion of the
terminal building was not exclusively required to handle transit traf-
fic, the economic return would increase by 1%. The unquantified benefit
of continued operation of widebody aircraft on the Europe to Senegal
flights (possible because of strengthening of Dakar runway) with its
contribution to tourism development would also increase the economic
return.
IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      Financial performance under the project reflected the evolu-
tion of three different factors: (a) generation of revenues; (b) control
of expenses; and (c) financial management and control, particularly in
the area of receivables collection.
(a) Revenue generation has been generally satisfactory, supported
by frequent rate increases and the compensation of falling
landing  revenues  by  increased  passenger  revenues.   Rental
revenues, while representing significant accounting income,
have been poorly managed and have poor collectability.
(b) Personnel expenses have grown disproportionately since 1982,
reflecting  a  number  of  large  salary  increases.   Working
expenses related to secondary airports continued to represent
close to one-half of total working expenses, even though these
airports handle no more than 2% of all aircraft and passenger
movements.
.-) Agreed-on improvements in collection of receivables, reliabil-
ity and transparency of financial data, and efficiency of
accounting and financial management did not materialize.
Accumulated arrears in receivables through June 30, 1984
totalled approximately one billion CFAF, an amount equal to
half of one year's revenue. Audit services financed in part
through the Project have returned to their pre-Project levels,
having had limited effect on accounting systems or management
practices.
Revenues
4.02      Table 2 gives  a  summary  of  revenues  by  type  compared  to
projections of the Staff Appraisal Report during the term of the Pro-
ject.   Revenue  from landing charges has decreased and reflects  the
combined effect of a 15% cumulative rise in the rate per ton of aircraft

tiona' terms, this reflects the discontinuation of the use of Dakar as a
transir and re-uelin2 stop for flights to South America.  An additional

factor, which is difficult to evaluate, is the fact that recorded
revenues represented 66% of theoretical revenues based on landing
statistics in 1979 and 55% of such revenues  in 1983.   The apparent
under-recording of revenues appears to have increased during the period
of the Project,  thus reducing revenues  further.   It appears that a
significant percentage of aircraft movements is escaping the billing
process.
4.03      Revenue  from  passenger  charges,  despite  the  reduction  in
landings, has shown relatively steady growth during the period.  The
growth from 1979 to 1982 is due solely to an increase in the number of
departing passengers (281,000 to 317,000).  The increases of 1983 and
1984 reflect a major tariff increase (an average of 40-50%) and continu-
ation of the steady growth in passenger departures (328,000 in 1983 and
347,000 in 1984). Under-recording of revenues does not appear to be
significant  in this category.   In operational  terms,  the growth  in
passenger departures appears to refle:t continuing growth in tourism,
and the simultaneous drop in landings results from the larger number of
departing  passengers  per  aircraft.   Based  on  available  statistics,
revenues from secondary airports represent less than 2% in all revenue
categories.
4.04      Revenue  from miscellaneous  rentals  has  been  significantly
ahead of projections since 1982, but as Table 5 shows, fully 40% of the
revenues in this category remain uncollected (a total of approximately
650 million CFAF).   Reasons for these problems include dt,sputes with
lessees due to vaguely worded contracts and disagreement over allowances
for leasehold improvements, lessees in financial difficulty, and late
payments by state-affiliated lessees. This situation is aggravated by
poor record-keeping and poor coordination between Dakar Airport's
management and the Direction Generale  of ASECNA.   In organizational
terms, the problem is located chiefly at the level of the Dakar Airport,
which is responsible for record-keeping and collection efforts.
Expenses
4.05      As shown in Table 3, during the period 1979 to 1984 expenses
have remained generally from 75-80% of those projected in the Staff
Appraisal Report. Working expenses have tended to remain steadily in
the range of 55-60% of total revenues.  Personnel expenses have shown
significant increases since 1982, due to a series of salary increases
between 1982 and 1984 totalling about 30%.  Expenses related to secon-
dary airports continued to represent a disproportionate share of working
expenses by almost anv measure. Although calculations are imprecise due
to the nature of the ASECNA accounting system, it appear-s that more than
half of all working expenses were attributable to secondary airports
whose traffic was no more than 2% of the total in all categories. This
trend showed no improvement over the period of the Project. While it is
true that working expenses as a ratio of revenues have not increased
significantly during the period, it should be noted that these expenses
represented cash outlays, and the revenue stream included a significant

Page 7 of 8
portion of doubtful rental income.  Cash flow difficulties have been
commou in recent-years.
4.06      Table 3 shows a comparison of return on Net Fixed Assets for
the period 1979 to 1984 compared with that projected in the 1979 Staff
Appraisal Report.   Unfortunately,  it is not possible to compare the
fixed asset base, using the same criteria, as the ASECNA assets have not
been revalued and represent historical costs. Given the theoretical and
practical difficulties in computing Net Fixed Assets from the available
records, the return values should be considered as indicative rather
than exact.  Nonetheless, the trend was relatively stable and it seems
reasonable to state that the returns were not high enough, given the low
denominator, to meet the agreed-on targets. At the same time, it should
be said that relative financial stability has been achieved with a much
larger fixed asset base.
Internal Generation of Funds
4.07      As in other areas, the complexity and dispersion of financial
information renders a detailed analysis of funds flows during the period
under review  difficult.   Major  trends and problems  are nonetheless
relatively clear.  Table 5 presents the annual internal generation of
funds from operations (including subsidies) and the amount of these
funds consumed in repayment of principal on outstanding debts.  It is
clear from the analysis that the surplus generated was substantially
reduced in 1980 and 1981, achieving some degree of stability from 1982
to 1984. Unfortunately, a deterioration in the quality of receivables
(mentioned above) and 70 million CFAF in arrears on Government subsidies
casts doubts on the quality of these surpluses. This is well illustrat-
ed by the discrepancy between accounting surplus and actual cash surplus
shown in Table 7.
Financial and Accounting Management
4.08      Under the terms of the Loan and Project Agreements as amended,
a full-scale financial audit for the year 1981 and 1982 was financed
with Project funds. Under a related loan from the FAC, the same audit-
ing firm designed a new, streamlined accounting and financial management
system for the whole ASECNA system. The audits generated considerable
amounts of information as to deficiencies in the existing structure of
internal control and accounting procedures, as a result of which a
standard "clean opinion" could not be issued.  Since this time, these
audits have not been continued.  Some major deficiencies noted by the
auditors received increased attention but there was no evidence of a
coordinated and detailed effort to deal with the problems raised, nor to
monitor progress in their resolution.   Unfortunatelv,  the audit work
concentrated on problems with ASECNA's Direction Gsn6rale and did not
deal sufficientlv with problems spec4fic to the Dakar Airport. Nor did
the auditors propose pragmatic solutions to deal with the problems of
local accounting organizations.

Page 8 of 8
4.09      In general terms, the ASECNA structure encourages the disper-
sion of data and the establishment of "spheres of influence" which
retain considerable autonomy.   (The accounting department  is divided
into five separate "agencies," whose level of coordination leaves a
great deal to be desired). The financial staff at the Senegal Repre-
sentation reflects this situation in its simultaneous dependence on the
Head Office for any initiatives (which are rarely forthcoming), and
certain key information (printouts, etc.) and its physical and manageri-
al autonomy. Progress during the period of the Project In dealing with
these problems was minimal.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE BY ASECNA
5.01      ASECNA's role in supervising the physical implementation of
the project has been satisfactory. Management of the airport facilities
has weakened in recent years. Maintenance has not always been adequate
and little effort is being made to find ways to better handle present
traffic by requesting that schedules be adjusted and through minor
modifications of facilities.   Instead,  the management believes  that
airport expansion and renewal are the only solutions.   Recently, in
order to etse congestion resulting from several airlines having sched-
uled departures or arrivals at the same time, the Minister of Equipment,
who is in charge of aviation, has insisted on better schedules.
5.02      Financial management is unsatisfactory and has not shown any
signs of improvement. The Government seems to have done very little to
control this situation.  Financial covenants were mostly not complied
with. For the years 1979-85, only one audit has been prepared instead
of seven.  Net fixed assets have not been revalued and, therefore, the
real return on assets is unknown. Receivables were to decrease from 40%
to. .25% by 1980.  Instead,  they now stand at about 50%.  EvWn more
serious is the under-recording of revenues (para 4.02) and financial
transfers from the airport's accounts to the Direction G6n6rale of
ASECNA which do not seem in accordance with agreed on practice.  The
cash position of Dakar Airport could improve by CFAF 470 m if receiv-
ables were reduced to 25% as agreed. Furthermore, available funds could
increase by about CFAF 1.2 billion from accumulated under-recorded
revenues and about CFAF 660 million from funds collected but not re-
leased by the Direction Ggngrale of ASECNA to Dakar Airport. The total
of these funds would have been sufficient for adequate maintenance and
possibly some minor improvements.
VI. THE BANK'S ROLE
6.01      The Bank's contribution  to the project has generallv been
positive.  However, it has misjudged the development of transatlantic
air traffic by'not considering the risk of a much larger proportion of
these  flights by-passing Dakar.   In  spite  of frequent  supervision,
financial covenants were not implemented, and financial management of
Dakar Airport has deteriorated.
