SECOND AVIATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Economic Setting
1.01      Senegal is located along t?e Atlantic Ocean on the western tip of
West Africa. Most of its 196,000 km are in the Sudan-Sahel region and the
climate is typical of the area: a long dry season (up to nine months in the
north) and a season with limited rainfall, which is subject to considerable
annual fluctuation, particularly in the north and the center. Senegal's
predominantly rural population is about 5.0 million and growing at an annual
rate of 2.7%. About 70% of the people live in villages of less than 10,000
inhabitants.
1.02      Between 1970 and 1974, the country's gross domestic product (GDP)
grew at an average annual rate of 1.9%, and in 1977 per capita income was
about US$420. While about 80% of Senegal's labor force is employed in agri-
culture, this sector generates only about 25% of GDP because of poor soils and
low rainfall, compounded by severe cyclical droughts, the last one having
occurred in 1977-78. The principal crops are groundnuts, mainly for export,
and millet for domestic consumption. Senegal's economic growth is hampered by
a scarcity of natural resources. The main mineral resource is phosphate rock,
the price of which is depressed by a world market slump. Tourism is the
country's third largest earner of foreign exchange after groundnuts and
phosphate. A pleasant climate most of the year and good beaches on the
Atlantic Ocean south of the Cap Vert peninsula are attracting a growing number
of European tourists.
1.03      An important component of the country's GNP has been the services
provided by Dakar, the national capital and former capital of French West
Africa. While this role has diminished due to the growth of other cities in
the region, Dakar's substantial infrastructure and advantageous location make
it a staging point for traffic to and from MIali, Mauritania, Gambia and
Guinea-Bissau and a stopover for airline traffic between Europe and Latin
American and for international shipping.
B.   The Transport System
1.04      The transport system consists of a 1,034 km railway; a 13,300 km
road network, including 2,600 km paved and 3,300 km all-weather roads; a
deep-water, protected port at Dakar (the only one with such characteristics
in the Sahel zone) and three secondary ports; and an international airport at
Dakar and a network of smaller domestic airports. All components of the system,
except the road network, serve an important international function and reflect
the country's role as a regional center and transit point.



- 2 -
1.05      The railway comprises about 660 km of mainline between Dakar and the
Mali border forming part of the international line linking Dakar with Bamako
(Mali) and 374 km of branch lines. In FY1978 the railway carried about
1.7 million tons of freight, the bulk of which was short-haul phosphates from
the mine to Dakar port and Mali transit traffic. The railway has tradition-
ally been the dominant carrier of domestic freight, but due to deteriorating
service and efficiency it has lost its position over the past decade.
Passenger traffic declined substantially with the expansion of the road
network and the road vehicle fleet, particularly for shorter hauls.  The
railway has recently started to regain freight traffic as a result of strong
managerial action, technical assistance and training programs implemented
under the Third Railway Project (Loan 1518-SE, US$11 million, March 17, 1978).
1.06      The road network, generally well-developed relative to the size and
growth of the national economy, is concentrated in the more heavily populated
coastal regions and the groundnut-producing areas near Dakar, with a number of
main roads running parallel to the railway. However, many of the paved roads
were built before independence in 1960; a large proportion were not designed
for present traffic volumes and have suffered substantial damage. Some rural
and feeder roads are also in poor condition. The Government's main priority
in the medium term is rehabilitation and proper maintenance. The Bank will
support this policy with its proposed Fourth Highway Project, which was
appraised in December 1978. With very few exceptions, no new investments are
being planned for constructing or upgrading roads to those areas lacking year-
round road access and being served mostly by air transport.
1.07      The road vehicle fleet comprised about 74,000 vehicles in 1974 and
is estimated to be increasing at a rate of 5.5% per year.
1.08      Senegal's port and waterway system consists of major port facilities
at Dakar, supplemented by secondary ports at St. Louis, Kaolack and Ziguinchor.
Cargo through Dakar port doubled in the last ten years and now totals about 6
million tons per annum. The most important traffic includes petroleum (for
the national refinery, the port's bunkering services and aircraft refueling),
international traffic for Mali and Mauritania, and phosphates. Traffic
through the secondary ports, generally domestic, has been declining due to
increased competition from road transport operating out of Dakar.
C.  Transport Planning and Coordination
1.09      The responsibility for transport planning and coordination is shared
by three ministries. The Ministry of Planning has overall responsibility for
preparation of the four-year national development plans. The Ministry of
Finance exercises substantial influence in the planning process by specifying
overall amounts to be invested in each transport mode, determining the struc-
ture and level of taxes levied on transport services and maintaining financial
supervision of the state-owned transport enterprises. The Ministry of Equip-
ment proposes and executes Government policy in the transport sector through



--3 -
three directorates:  (a) Public Works, the general directorate responsib:Le
for the administration of, and investments in, the national highway system;
(b) Transport, the general directorate responsible for the regulation,
control and development of the various transport modes; and (c) Studies and
Programming (DSP), a directorate in Public Works responsible for studies
in all modes of transport and planning. DSP was created and is being
strengthened with technical assistance provided under the ongoing Third
Highway Project (Loan 1222-SE, US$15 rmillion, 1976); its main task is the
preparation of a National Transport P:Lan, which is expected to be completLed
in mid-1980.
D. Bank Assistance to the Transport Sector
1.10      The Bank Group has been a major contributor to the development of
the transport sector. Over the past 12 years, the Bank Group has invested
$82.7 million in the sector under 10 'Loans/credits (3 highway, 1 feeder road,
3 railway, 2 port and 1 aviation projects) plus feeder roads under agricultural
projects.
1.11      The highway projects have covered highway maintenance, pavement
strengthening, equipment, studies and training, technical assistance for
transport planning and development of the domestic construction industry.
Project works executed by contractors have been successful; highway mainte-
nance carried out by force account has not been satisfactory mainly because of
inadequate highway maintenance organization, failure to provide local funds on
time, and shortage of trained staff. The proposed Fourth Highway Project will
be designed to remedy this by focusing on road maintenance organization,
financing and training.
1.12      Execution of the first two railway projects, which were primarily
designed to rehabilitate the track and provide rolling stock, was hampered by
many delays mainly stemming from misunderstanding of bidding procedures and
lack of experience in mechanized track-laying under the first project, and
from changes in scope mostly due to a shortage of local funds for spare parts
under the second project. In addition the railway's operating performance was
less than satisfactory due to a shortage of adequately trained personnel.
Despite this, the projects, together with parallel projects for the connecting
Mali railway, helped prevent a collapse of operations on the Mali-Senegal
railway system. The ongoing Third Railway Project is primarily designed to
improve operational performance through a massive technical assistance effort
and strong measures to strengthen management.
1.13      The First Dakar Port Project, which was successfully carried out,
was designed to restore and expand general cargo handling facilities and
included important financial and institutional objectives. The ongoing
Second Port Project is designed to increase the fishing port's capacity and
efficiency through civil works and technical assistance; the project also
provides for a study of the development of container traffic and required port
facilities.
1.14      Tourism, an important source of air transport demand, has become a
major contributor to Senegal's GDP. To assist in developing this sector, the
Bank is helping by financing the Petite Cote Tourism Project (Loans 1412/13-SE,
US$13.6 million, 1977).



- 4 -
1.15      The First Aviation Project (Loan 867-SE, US$3.0 million, 1972),
successfully completed in 1976 1/, comprised the extension of the runway of
Dakar's international airport, enlarging aircraft parking aprons and related
works. It was aimed at making the airport suitable for large aircraft which
were being put into service, thus enabling Senegal to maintain its position
as staging point for transatlantic flights. Physical execution of the project
was good with few delays; the financial performance, traffic and economic re-
turn were very close to appraisal expectations. During implementation of the
project, the Government financed other airport improvements including an ex-
pansion of the terminal building, a new cargo shed and a new flight kitchen.
The second project now proposed aims at maintaining the attractiveness of Dakar
for international air traffic through the strengthening of the main runway and
taxiways and at modernizing navigational equipment at Senegal's two busiest
domestic airports, Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring.
II. THE AVIATION SUBSECTOR
A.   Organization
2.01      Civil Aviation in Senegal is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Equipment (ME) and of the Agence pour la Securite de la Navigation Aerienne en
Afrique et a Madagascar (ASECNA). ME carries out its responsibilities in the
subsector through the Directorate of Civil Aviation (DAC) in the Directorate
General of Transport. DAC supervises the operation of the state-owned airline,
Air Senegal, approves its investments and tariffs; it also sets Senegal's air
transport policy, negotiates agreements on the establishment of new air routes
to Senegal, supervises and regulates air charters and approves ASECNA-proposed
landing fee schedules. ASECNA is an international organization created under
a convention between 14 African countries and France. Its main tasks are to
control air navigation over the territories of the African member states and
to design, construct, manage, and operate airports as requested by individual
member states. The organization of the aviation sector is sound and works
quite efficiently.
B.   Air Services
2.02      The national airline, Air Senegal, provides domestic scheduled
services and limited international services. Air Senegal operates piston and
turbo-prop aircraft, covers a domestic network of 4,080 km serving 15 airports,
and carries about 60,000 passengers annually. The two busiest routes are the
ones connecting Dakar with Cap Skirring (271 km), a tourist resort on Senegal's
southern coast which has attracted growing traffic since the construction of
1/   See Project Performance Audit Report, Senegal-Dakar International Airport
Project, December 13, 1977.



- 5 -
tourist facilities in 1973, and with Ziguinchor (275 km), Senegal's third
largest city and the development pole of the Casamance region. In 1977 about
9,000 passengers travelled to Cap Skirring on Air Senegal and private charter
flights, mostly during the November-April tourist season, and about 10,()00
passengers travelled to Ziguinchor, at a relatively regular rate throughout
the year (Table 2.1). Traffic at the other 12 domestic airports served by Air
Senegal is substantially lower.
2.03      Due to the overall low level of traffic, domestic air services do
not generate enough revenue to cover ASECNA's costs, and the deficit from the
operation of domestic airports is covered by a Government subsidy. The
Government has also subsidized Air Senegal's operations; however, the airline
is expected to break even in 1978. ASECNA's deficit from domestic airport
,erations was CFAF 345 million (US$1.6 million) in 1977, but about 30%
stemmed from expenditures on meteorological services, which also serve
non-aviation purposes. An analysis of the deficit and measures proposed to
reduce it are described in Chapter VI and Annex 3.
2.04      International air transport services to and from Dakar, the only
airport in Senegal equipped to handle aircraft used on long-distance flights,
are provided by 22 airline companies including Air Senegal. Air Afrique, a
multinational airline, serves as Senegal's primary international airline. Air
Senegal is therefore limited to international service to contiguous states
not served by Air Afrique -- Senegal to Nouakchott (Mauritania), Praia (Cape
Verde) and Bissau (Guinea Bissau).
2.05      Dakar is a well-placed, convenient transit stop for flights between
Europe and Latin America. The city is almost on the great circle (minimum
distance) route between most European cities and Buenos Aires and Rio de
Janeiro, the first connecting points in Latin America. Dakar is the seat of
ASECNA's main Flight Information Center (FIC), which controls flights over
Senegal as well as over several other West African states and part of the
South Atlantic. Dakar's pleasant climate, excellent hotels and good general
business and airport services make it an attractive stop-over/rest point for
aircraft crews and a suitable place to provide required aircraft transit
services. With the introduction of very long-haul aircraft in the early
1970s, Dakar lost part of its advantage as direct flights started operating
between Rio de Janeiro and Paris. Some of the airlines now stopping in ])akar
on the Europe-Rio route are studying Lhe possibility of introducing direct
flights in the early or mid-1980s. However, although attractive to passengers
due to reduced travel time, very long distance direct flights require carrying
larger or duplicate crews, subject crews to longer flying hours, require more
fuel, and cause payload restrictions, all of which are likely to limit the
number of new direct flights. Dakar will continue to be an attractive st:op
for Europe-Buenos Aires flights as aircraft on this longer distance would face
severe payload penalties on non-stop flights.

C.   P'ast Traffic
2.06      Commercial air traffic, mainly international, through Dakar airport
has increased substantially over the past 10 years. Annual growth rates have
averaged 14.8% for passengers, 13.4% for freight and 7.9% for aircraft move-
ments. 1/ This traffic is summari'zed below and detailed in Table 2.2
Dakar Air Traffic
1968         1972         1977
Passengers ('000)                   156.9        236.4        506.2
Freight ('000 tons)                    5.4         6.9          16.3
Aircraft movements ('000)              7.6          9.7         14.5
2.07      During the same period, Dakar has continued to expand its role as
a passenger transit point between Europe and Latin America because of its
privileged geographical location and the quality of its facilities. Despite
efforts of airlines to reduce stops and increase direct flights, the number
of transit passengers (i.e. passengers remaining on the same flight) increased
from about 100,000 in 1968 to 250,000 in 1977, or a 10% average annual growth.
2.08      In 1977, Dakar handled 757,115 passengers of whom 250,884 were
international transit and 506,231 began or ended trips at Dakar. Of the
506,231 passengers, Air Senegal handled 42,098 or 8%, Air Afrique (in which
Senegal is a shareholder) handled 165,179 or 33% and foreign airlines handled
298,954 or 59%. As Air Afrique handles only international passengers and Air
Senegal has a small international component, less than 8% of Dakar's traffic
is of domestic origin/destination. Of this more than 50% is foreign tourist
traffic. Senegalese exports constituted 68% of air freight in 1977 and
imports 32%; internal freight transport was negligible. Aircraft movements
were 81% by foreign airlines and 19% by Air Senegal.
D.   Traffic Forecast
2.09      ASECNA has thoroughly analyzed trends in passenger, freight and
aircraft movements at Dakar airport and has made projections, as shown below,
which serve as the basis for the forecast for 1978-1984.
1/   Passengers:  boarding and disembarking in Dakar; freight:  exports
and imports; aircraft movements:  landings and take-offs.

August 1978
2.10      Passenger traffic is expected to grow at an average of 12% annually
which is high but lower than the long-term trend and the more recent trend of
16.5% from 1972 through 1977. During the first quarter of 1978, passenger
travel between Dakar and Europe, representing about 50% of total Dakar pas-
senger traffic, was 16% above the first quarter of 1977. In the future,
travel by business passengers and local residents should continue to grow as
in the past, but the third component of Dakar passenger traffic, tourists,
will probably not be able to maintain its past growth rate. The number of
tourists visiting Senegal more than doubled between 1972 and 1975 as a result
of vigorous Government policies in the sector and the tripling of hotel capa-
city. In the coming years, however, tourism is expected to increase at about
6% per year, and expansion of hotel capacity is based on this projection. 1/
2.11      Air freight traffic consists mostly of Senegalese exports of fruits
and vegetables produced by cooperatives in the Cap Vert area and some fish
and other seafood products destined for Europe.  Senegalese exports enjoy a
low tariff as this traffic is back-haul for aircraft returning from Africa to
Europe via Dakar. Wide-body cargo planes have recently been put into service
on these routes, and this should further reduce the cost of exporting Senegalese
products. However, since Dakar is only 6-10 days from Europe by sea, general
air freight to Senegal remains low and has little potential for growth. Total
air freight is forecast to grow at 13% a year, which has been the average
rate over the last 10 years and is consistent with Senegal's potential for
increasing exports of agricultural arLd sea products.
2.12      Consistent with a world-wide trend, aircraft movements at Dakar
airport have grown less than passenge!r and freight traffic because of the
increased use of larger aircraft. The index of aircraft movements per traffic
unit 2/ (passenger plus freight) for Dakar decreased from 34.2 in 1968 to 21.0

in 1977, similar to other West and Central African countries. Despite this,
Dakar aircraft movements grew at a rate of 7.9% a year between 1971 and 1977.
In addition to the use of bigger aircraft, the following counterbalancing
factors will influence the number of aircraft movements at Dakar airport:
(a)  Transit flights:  The number of flights between Europe
and Latin America transiting Dakar will probably
remain constant in the coming years, despite an increase
in demand, due to (i) the increase in direct flights
between Europe and Latin America as more long-range
aircraft (such as the Boeing 747-SP) become available,
and (ii) the expected increase in flights to Europe by
Latin American airlines (mainly Argentina and Brazil)
which do not transit via Dakar; and
(b)  Europe-Dakar flights:  Most European companies already
flying to or via Dakar plan to introduce new flights
between Europe and Dakar around 1980, using Boeing 727,
DC-8 or similar type aircraft, and it is likely that
new companies will also be attracted to this market.
2.13      Considering the above facztors, it is estimated that total commercial
aircraft movements will increase at an annual rate of 6% through 1980, that is,
somewhat below the growth rate achieved in the past due to the stagnation of
Europe-Latin America transit flights, and at 8% annually after 1980 when the
new, direct Europe-Dakar flights using relatively small aircraft, start
service.

III. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A. Background
3.01      ASECNA was created by the Convention of St. Louis (December 12,
1959) between France and 14 African states, including Senegal. The conven-
tion distinguishes ASECNA's two main functions as follows:
(i)  International functions, governed by Article 2 of the
convention, are the control of air navigation over the
territory of the African member states and the operation
of approach and landing aids at the main airports.
(ii)  Domestic functions, governed by Articles 10 and 12 of
the convention, are regulated by bi-lateral agreements
between individual member states and ASECNA. These
functions include managing, operating and maintaining
ground facilities of member states' airports, preparing
studies, designing and building airport facilities for
member states and providing other services as required.
3.02      In the beginning ASECNA had a large French expatriate staff with
a definite plan for training replacemenLt African personnel. This training
program was successful and in 1976 a new treaty, the Dakar Convention, was
adopted by the African States. ASECNA is now supported, directed and manned
by these states with the help of only aL few French expatriate specialists.
Although France is not a signatory state to the 1976 convention, a close
working relationship continues between ASECNA and French civil aviation
authorities who provide the expatriate technical staff.
B. Organization
3.03      A committee of the ministers responsible for air transport in the
member states lays down the broad lines of policy for ASECNA.  A president
and an administrative council, made up of ministerial delegates from all
member states, are responsible for administration while a director-general is
responsible for the day-to-day running of all ASECNA activities. He in turn
is assisted by experts drawn from the various states.
3.04      ASECNA headquarters is in Dakar, but it is represented in each
member country by an agent appointed by the president of the council. Each
representative has a technical staff and is responsible for all ASECNA opera-
tions in his country. ASECNA is well-organized and the staff is competent
and effective. A training school is maintained at Niamey in Niger.



- 12 -
3.05      Dakar-Yoff International Airport (hereafter Dakar Airport) and most
of the domestic airports including Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring are managed,
operated and maintained by ASECNA under the general direction of the agent or
representative for Senegal who reports to the director general. This service
is provided under the terms of agreements between the Government of Senegal
and ASECNA.
3.06      ASECNA acted as executing agency for the Bank's First Senegal
Aviation Project and for the First Niger Aviation Project under the terms of
special contracts with Senegal and Niger respectively. The execution of these
projects was satisfactory in all respects. It is proposed, therefore, that
ASECNA act as executing agency for the Second Senegal Aviation Project under
the terms of a special contract with Senegal. The special contract will in-
clude the terms and conditions for the implementation of the project as well
as the financial conditions (subsidiary loan agreement) under which the pro-
ceeds of the Bank loan will be made available to ASECNA. The signing of the
special contract will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.07      In 1978 ASECNA had 765 employees at Dakar Airport.  Overall, ASECNA
has more than 4,000 permanent employees in all member countries with an ex-
patriate component of less than 10%.
C. Budgeting, Accounting and Auditing
3.08      The financial organization and the accounting procedures ASECNA has
developed reflect the functions it performs, i.e. international navigation
under Article 2 and management of domestic airports and other operations under
the special agreements provided for under Articles 10 and 12 of the Dakar con-
vention. Under the special agreement between the Government of Senegal and
ASECNA, ASECNA's Planning and Studies Department prepares the airport's
capital and current budgets and its accounting department is responsible for
the accounting.
3.09      Accounts for the flight information centers and other air navigation
related activities, managed under Article 2 are kept on a multinational basis.
Only a small part of the services provided by the centers relate to air traffic
over Senegalese territory, and therefore only part of the revenues and costs
is charged to Senegal. Any deficit is offset by subsidies paid by member
countries under agreed conditions and in agreed proportions.
3.10      Management of the airport ground facilities in Senegal complies
with Articles 10 and 12. Under tlhese articles, part of the gross operating
revenues generated by Senegalese airports is assigned to "special accounts" to
be used for large investments and their debt service. Any revenues remaining
after deducting operating expenses are used for current investments and their
debt service.



- 13 -
3.11      The general accounting system is essentially budgetary and does
not report the true cost of operations of any one airport, nor does it take
into account depreciation. However, ASECNA is able to extract from its
accounts direct costs for single airports and to calculate the proportion of
indirect costs and depreciation appropriate to the operations of each airport.
3.12      The accounting department is, under an agent comptable appointed by
the administrative council with the agreement of the committee of ministers.
The agent comptable reports to the director general who is responsible for
submitting the financial statements related to international operations and
special agreements to the administrative council and to member countries'
governments. A comptable subordonne, appointed by the director general with
e agreement of the agent comptable, is seconded to each member country's
epresentative to keep the domestic airport's accounts under the special
agreements. The comptable subordonne reports to the agent comptable.
ASECNA's accounting staff is well-qualified and competent.
3.13      A controleur financier, appointed by the administrative counci:L,
with the agreement of the committee oi ministers, is in charge of the internal
auditing of ASECNA's economically and financially related matters. The
controleur financier initials a priori major financial commitments and pay-
ments. He has the authority to defer or cancel their execution after having
informed the director general of the reasons for his decisions.
3.14.     Within two months of their provisional approval by the administra-
tive council ASECNA's annual financial statements are sent for auditing to
the Commission de Verification des Comptes which consists of three members
selected by the administrative council from a list of qualified candidates
proposed by member countries. The commission is then given six months to
prepare the audit report which is sent to the administrative council and to
the ministries of member countries in charge of supervising ASECNA for final
approval or possible modification of the year's financial statements. As this
procedure is unduly slow in producing a certified audit report of ASECNA's
financial position, the Government and ASECNA have agreed to appoint indepen-
dent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to provide an audit report within
six months of the close of the fiscal year. The standard covenant has been
included as Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement.
IV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01      The proposed project is part of a phased airport development plan
and is included in the Government's Fifth Development Plan. Dakar Airport's
importance to the Senegalese economy lies in its three main functions: First,
as an international staging point it provides services to several foreign air-
lines and is, therefore, a source of foreign exchange. Second, it allows



- 14 -
Senegal to make use of the services of these airlines for its own commerci'l
and tourist requirements, placing Dakar in a very advantageous position.
Third, the airport permits Dakar to serve as the hub of a domestic and regional
air transport industry.
4.02      The objective of the Government under the overall development plan
is to promote a sound civil air transport system. Specific objectives at
Dakar under the airport development plan are (i) to maintain its attractive-
ness for international air traffic by exploiting its favorable location as an
important staging point for long-range flights to central Africa and South-
America, and (ii) to stimulate growth thereby generating increased foreign
exchange earnings and greater job opportunities for Senegalese. The Govern-
ment 's objectives at Ziguinchor anid Cap Skirring airports are to promote
tourism and at the same time, provide scope for Air Senegal to improve air-
craft utilization, reduce costs and enhance service levels by providing
reliable air navigation and night flying aids. Under the proposed project,
investment in these two airports is small and based on the need to increase
air safety mainly by improving night-landing capabilities and replacing
obsolete equipment.
B. Project Description
4.03      The proposed project includes (i) strengthening and levelling the
main runway and taxiway and improving the taxiway alignment at Dakar airport,
(ii) installing navigation aids, runway lighting and related works at
Ziguinchor, and (iii) providing visual approach aids at Cap Skirring.
Dakar Airport
4.04      The paved areas at Dakar airport were not originally designed to
support the heavier modern jet aircraft which began to be put into service in
the late 1960s. The steadily increasing use of these aircraft has caused the
pavement to deteriorate. The detetrioration of the runway was recognized at
the time of appraisal of the First Senegal Aviation Project and a strengthening
overlay was included in the investment program. A careful evaluation at the
time of project implementation led to the conclusion that the work of reha-
bilitation could be deferred until 1978. A few particularly bad portions of
the runway were patched as part of the first project but these sections are
again showing distress.  The lengthening of the runway under the first project
has meant much heavier allowable take-off weights and this, plus increased
traffic movements, has contributed to an acceleration of the deterioration of
the runway.
4.05      Under the proposed project, the pavement will be resurfaced with
asphaltic cement concrete sufficiently thick to arrest the deterioration and
supply the necessary strength to support large aircraft. The completed work
will match the strength and performance characteristics of the runway exten-
sion carried out under the first aviation project. A detailed description of
the improvement works is given in Annex I.



- 15 -
Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring Airports
4.06      The ability to carry out night operations safely and efficiently
will expand Air Senegal's operational capacity. The proposed improvements to
the airports at Ziguinchor and Cap Sk:irring are a step in bringing about such
an expansion. At Ziguinchor the proposed project will include (i) the procure-
ment and installation of a VOR, replacing obsolete equipment, in order to
provide a reliable navigation aid, and (ii) runway lighting, together with
motor generators and controls, to facilitate night landing. As Ziguinchor is
on an established air route to the south, the VOR will be a useful aid for
aircraft enroute to Conakry and beyond as well as for local traffic require-
ments. Since runway lighting, urgently needed at Cap Skirring, is being
installed by ASECNA, it is, therefore, not included in the project. The
project will provide visual aids for Cap Skirring, and these, coupled with
the runway lighting at Ziguinchor, will constitute a reliable domestic night
flying route in this important section of the country.
C. Cost Estimate
4.07      The total project cost including contingencies is CFAF 1,996 million
(US$9.074 million equivalent). The foreign exchange component is CFAF 1,510
million (US$6.864 million equivalent) or 76% of the total cost. The Govern-
ment has agreed that the project contractors and suppliers will be exonerated
from paying customs duties and income and other taxes.
4.08      The cost estimates shown below (in January 1978 prices), which
exclude customs duties and taxes, are categorized by site. A detailed itemi-
zation of project components is given in Annex I, Table 1.
4.09      The cost estimates were developed by ASECNA which carried out the
required engineering studies. The estimates were updated and revised during
appraisal, and the costs are considered reasonable. No additional land will
be acquired as the work will be carried out on existing airport property.
4.10      Physical contingencies amounting to 10% based on detailed design,
have been included in the cost estimate. An item for price contingencies is
included and averages 10% per annum f-or local costs, 6% per annum for equip-
ment procurement, 7.4% per annum for the foreign cost component of civil
works, and 7.4% per annum on engineering and supervision.

D. The Borrower
4.11       The Government will be the borrower and the proceeds of the loan
will be on-lent to ASECNA under the same terms and conditions as the loan to
the Government. ASECNA will control and disburse the funds. The Bank will
enter into a Project Agreement with ASECNA for the execution of the project.
E. Implementation
4.12      ASECNA will be responsible for the construction and subsequent
operation of the project works under the terms of agreements between the
agency and the Government of Senegal which are satisfactory to the Bank. The
project management, design, engineering and construction supervision will be
performed by ASECNA's own staff, which is competent and experienced, on a



- 17 -
percentage fee basis. The estimated cost of these services is much lower than
would be the case if outside consultants were retained, due in part to the
agency's familiarity with conditions and procedures in the region. The total
cost of US$356,000 for these services is very reasonable under the circum-
stances.
4.13      The work at Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring will not interfere with
aircraft operations and no problems are envisaged. The paving at Dakar will
interfere with operations and it will be necessary to limit the hours during
which paving can be done each day and to reschedule some flights. Every
effort will be made to keep the interference to a minimum.
F. Procurement
4.14      The civil works at Dakar airport will be carried out through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.15      For purposes of standardization with existing air navigation equip-
ment throughout the ASECNA system and to take advantage of ASECNA's bulk pur-
chasing procedures, ASECNA will negotiate with overseas suppliers for the
highly specialized electronic and electrical equipment costing about
US$300,000 for Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring. Installation of the equipment
will be by ASECNA staff. This procedure is consistent with normal ASECNA
equipment procurement practice for their member countries. The arrangement
has been used in past Bank projects with ASECNA and has proven satisfactory.
4.16      A building (CFAF 10.0 million, US$45,000 equivalent) to house new
electrical switchgear and an emergency power plant together with other
related civil works at Ziguinchor will be executed by a local contractor
under local bidding and procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
G. Financing and Disbursement
4.17      The proposed Bank loan would furnish the funds to cover the foreign
exchange component of the project (para. 4.07). ASECNA would furnish the
remainder of the project costs from internally generated funds. Disbursement
of funds from the loan would be on the following basis:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditure for equipment and its
installation, and 70% of local costs;
(b) 80% of total costs for civil works; and.
(c) 80% of total cost for engineering and supervision.
A schedule showing the estimated rate of disbursement is shown on the follow-
ing page.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Investment Objective
5.01      Traffic at Dakar airport has grown at a high rate during the last
10-15 years, and the forecast calls for sustained growth in the foreseeabLe
future (Chapter 2).  This traffic potential, however, is threatened by deteri-
oration of the runway and taxiways because they were built to support
the lighter aircraft of the 1950s and early 1960s.  The heavier aircraft now
in use have caused a rapid increase in the number and importance of pavement
cracks and slab failures. Some of the more badly damaged sections of runway
were repaired during extension of the runway under the first project, but the
repairs were temporary measures and were not intended to provide greater
pavement strength. Unless something is done now to correct the situation,
the runway will continue to deteriorate and, within a few years, become
inoperative. As Dakar is Senegal's only international airport, its closure
would isolate the country from international air services. The objective
of the proposed project is to strengthen the pavement thereby permitting
continued use of the airport by modern, heavier aircraft at full payload.
B.   Investment Alternatives
5.02      The rational alternative, were the proposed project not to be
executed, would be to limit the weight of aircraft flying into Dakar to
the original design strength of the runway but taking into account its deteri-
orated condition. Without weight restrictions on aircraft, the pavement
cracking and slab failures would continue, leading to the eventual closing of
the airport.
5.03      The runway and other aircraft areas were designed and built to
support aircraft equivalent to a Boeirng-707 (150 tons gross take-off weight).
Due to the deterioration of the runway, its present bearing capacity is
somewhat below the original design strength. With weight restrictions, a
Boeing-707 type aircraft could still be accepted at Dakar but with a payload
penalty, and heavier aircraft would be banned or subject to a severe weight
penalty.
5.04      The runway could be operated with weight restrictions for an aLmost
indefinite period of time. As the reduced allowable weight would depend on
the degree of existing deterioration, restrictions should be determined
and enforced immediately to avoid a further reduction in allowable aircraft
weight.



- 20 -
5.05      Placing weight restrictions on the runway would principally affect
the Europe-Latin America aircraft transiting Dakar for the following reasons:
(a) planes stopping in Dakar on these routes are heavily loaded, long-range
aircraft which cannot be operated economically under severe payload restric-
tions nor be replaced for such distances by smaller aircraft; (b) there are
other airports to which the aircraft could be diverted for transit stops on
the Latin America-Europe route (e.g. Sal Island, Cape Verde) at relatively
small additional cost, even though such airports are less well-equipped and
are less convenient; and (c) passenger traffic between Dakar and Latin America
is negligible, and therefore on the Latin America-Europe routes Dakar is
appealing because of its location and quality of services.  For practically
all other flights with Dakar either as terminus or as a transit point, lighter
aircraft are normally used and Dakar is an important origin of passenger
demand. In these cases, therefore, despite inconveniences and higher costs
resulting from weight restrictions, airlines would probably be able to maintain
service by introducing smaller aircraft or accepting payload limitations.
C.   Benefits
5.06      The economic analysis of the proposed project focuses on the bene-
fits forgone to the Senegalese economy if Europe-Latin America flights which
now stop at Dakar were diverted to other airports. It is assumed that with
runway weight restrictions, the Concorde, Boeing-747s and DC-lOs would cease
using Dakar. There are four quantifiable benefits:
(a) revenues from landing charges;
(b) expenditures by the crews stopping over in Dakar;
(c)  sale of aviation fuel; and
(d) sale of airport-related services (catering, duty-free shop).
5.07      Landing Charges.  The loss in landing charges, on the basis of
1978 traffic, would amount to CFAF 363.5 million per year, as detailed below:
Unit Landing    Annual Landing
Type of       Annual           Charge           Revenue
Airline          Aircraft       Landings        CFAF '000        CFAF million
Air France       Concorde         208             218.8             45.5
Air France       Bowing-747       208             427.0             88.8
Lufthansa        DC-10            208             314.7             65.5
Swiss Air        DC-10            312             314.7             98.2
Alitalia         DC-10            208             314.7             65.5
Total                                                            363.5



- 21 -
5.08      Crew Expenditures.  The diversion of aircraft transiting Dakar
to other airports would mean a loss to Senegal of expenditures by the crews
stopping over in Dakar. On the basis of the schedule shown above, it is
estimated there would be a loss of crew nights as follows:
Aircraft Type                  Crew-nights
B-747                          7,488
DC-10                         20,384
Total                         27,872
The Concorde is excluded from this computation as the Concorde's crew is not
changed in Dakar due to the shorter flight time Paris-Dakar-Rio de Janeiro
than with conventional jet aircraft.
5.09      The value added foregone to Senegal is estimated at CFAF 5,000 per
crew-night. 1/ To compute annual value-added benefits, the analysis takes
into account the fact that during two peak months per year the crews take up
hotel space which could otherwise be occupied by tourists. Because tourists
spend more money, they are estimated to generate CFAF 2,000 value added per
night more than crew, thus slightly reducing Senegal's benefits during these
two months. The annual value added foregone to Senegal from crew expenditures
would amount to CFAF 107.3 million/year.
5.10      Fuel Sales.  The sale of aviation fuel generates an estimated
CFAF 1,225 per ton of net benefit to the Senegalese economy. 1/ The diversion
of transit flights would cause a drop in fuel sales of about 125,000 tons per
year, causing an annual loss to Senegal of CFAF 153.8 million.
5.11      Other Airport Services.  In 1977, sales of airport related services
(i.e. catering, duty-free shops, and bar and restaurant) amounted to about
CFAF 820 million, with an estimated value-added component of CFAF 380 million.
Taking into account the proportion oi- transit passengers to total Dakar passen-
gers, which is about 15%, it is estirnated that the losses to the Senegalese
economy from diverting transit flights would be about CFAF 57 million/year.
D. Rate of Return
5.12      Taking into account the above benefits, which are assumed to be
constant (Chapter 2) over the 15 year life of the project, and the economic
projects costs (Table below), the rate of return for the proposed investment
at Dakar airport, representing 92% oi total project costs, would be 39%.

5.13      The assessment of the Dakar project's return is conservative as it
omits several benefits difficult to quantify. In particular, if the project
were not carried out: (a) runway maintenance costs would increase even if
restrictions on weight were enforced; (b) the diversion of transit traffic
would cause a drop in the number of tourists visiting Senegal because addi-
tional seat space available on transit flights allows the offering of low
rates to tour groups from Europe to Dakar (e.g. US$200-250 compared with
US$550 for the lowest round-trip Paris-Dakar) and would reduce backhaul
capacity for perishable goods; and (c) other services for transit traffic
providing employment to Senegalese, such as aircraft cleaning and assistance
in passenger boarding and deplaning, would be reduced. The analysis also
takes the conservative view that diverted flights would continue to use
Dakar's traffic control center and that ASECNA. would not, therefore, lose air
navigation revenues. The objectives of the works at Cap Skirring and
Ziguinchor have been discussed above (para 4.02), and the investment is fully
justified in terms of air safety. In addition, this investment will result in
more frequent flights and increased aircraft utilization over the Dakar-Cap
Skirring-Ziguinchor route, generating a net benefit estimated at CFAF 27
million/year and savings in maintenance costs of equipment estimated at CFAF 4
million/year; its estimated rate of return is 14%. The rate of return for the
whole project, including Dakar and domestic airports, is 37%.
E. Sensitivity and Risks
5.14      Execution of the project should be straightforward and no major
problems are anticipated. The project's return would be 34% under a 10%
increase in construction costs and 30% if project benefits were 20% lower than
estimated. Were these two events to occur simultaneously, the project would
still have a high rate of return of 28%.
5.15      The only identifiable uncertainty that could have a major impact on
the project would be the possible relocation of Dakar airport. The capacity
of the airport should be sufficient for air transport demand during the next
20 years and therefore relocation would not be justified on capacity grounds.
However, some government agencies are suggesting that the airport is hampering
the city's development and that for this reason it should be relocated. This



- 23 -
question should be resolved under a comprehensive urban study, which the
Government is planning to undertake. It is estimated that, should a re]Loca-
tion be justified and taking into account the time required to carry out
urban and engineering studies, arrange financing and carry out construction,
it would be a minimum of 10 years before a new airport is in operation.
In this event, and considering financial benefits alone, i.e. lost airport
revenue from landing charges and airport services, the rate of return for the
Dakar component of the proposed project would drop to an acceptable 25%.  In
order to monitor any airport relocation plans, the Government has agreed to
(i) inform the Bank of any studies aiffecting airport relocation and (ii)
consult with the Bank before making any decisions on airport relocation.
VI. FINANC:[AL EVALUATION 1/
A.   Background
6.01      ASECNA's financial system reflects the dual nature of its operations
in Senegal and in each of its member states, as stipulated in Article 2 and
Articles 10 and 12 of the Convention of Saint Louis (para. 3.01). ASCENA's
income account for the period 1973-1978 with regard to its Article 2 and
Article 10/12 operations in Senegal is shown in Table 6.01 and summarized
below. The annual total cost of ASECNA operations in Senegal to the Senegalese
Government increased from CFAF 339 million in 1973 to CFAF 390 million in
1974, but has been relatively stable since then. Of this total cost, somewhat
over 50% represents the subsidy payment under the Article 2 international
accords to cover the cost of ASECNA's regional air traffic and air navigation
control functions. The level of this payment is not controllabli by any
single member country, but is set by the ASECNA Board each year. Article
10/12 operations are, however, fully controllable by Senegal as they represent
the management of the airport infrastructure in the country.

6.02      As a result of the above duality, and consequent thereupon, the
financial evaluation of the proposed project has been limited to an analysis
of only the relevant portion of ASECNA accounts that have a direct bearing on
the operation of the Senegalese airport system - accounts that are entirely
controllable by Senegal by virtue of its Article 10/12 bilateral agreement.
As Article 2 subsidy assessments are likely to increase in the coming years,
it is all the more important for Senegal to analyze and control Article 10/12
operations and attempt to minimize its direct subsidy so that its total cost
from ASECNA operations can at least remain fixed at present levels thereby
declining in real terms in future years.

6.03      ASECNA's financial performance under the First Aviation Project
(para. 1.11) was very good, insofar as it related to Dakar Airport operations.
ASECNA's Article 10/12 account however covers all airports in Senegal, and
Tables 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04 1/ show the accounts for Dakar, Other Airports and
the Consolidated Senegal Airport Sector. The recent evolution of the income
account is summarized in the table below:

6.04      The table shows that:

with inflation.
(b)  Dakar Airport's net operating revenue and net profit increased
substantially over the 1976-78 period; this is reflected in
the improving rate of return on net fixed assets in use which
increased from 7.4% in 1976 to 9.1% in 1978 (Table 6.02).
(c)  Because of the improving financial performance of Dakar Airport,
the overall domestic net operating revenue performance is
expected to show a slight: profit by 1978. However, since
this will not be enough to cover interest charges, ASECNA's
Senegalese operations will suffer a net deficit estimated at
CFAF 118 million.

Were it not for the CFAF 539 million Government subsidy, ASECNA would have
been short of working capital due to the large cash deficit incurred by
domestic airports (CFAF 773 million). However, thanks to this subsidy,
ASECNA's financial position by the end of 1978 should be acceptable with a
1.6 current ratio and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.2 (Table 6.06). The only
worrisome aspect of this situation is the high level of accounts receivable.
The CFAF 480 million represents 40% of ASECNA's anticipated 1978 gross revenue.
Main debtors are: foreign airlines, mainly African countries' national air-
lines; local air freight companies; and the Senegalese company in charge of
catering serices at Dakar Airport. During negotiations, the Government and
ASECNA agreed to take immediate action aimed at progressively reducing this
percentage to 25% by the end of 1980, a target which is now a covenant in the
proposed loan and project agreements.

C. Financial Objectives
6.06      The analysis of the past financial performance of the Senegalese
airport system reveals some fundamental. problems which, if allowed to persist
in the future, could impose extraordinary burdens on the government budget and
seriously undermine the Dakar airport's ability to remain competitive on inter-
national routes by impairing its borrowing capacity and thereby limiting its
ability to undertake long term investments and improvements. In particular,
the unlimited transfer of Dakar airport: surpluses to cover a part of the
operating deficits of other airports, and the use of a government subsidy to
cover the remainder of the deficits have made it difficult for ASECNA to set
realistic targets for financial control. Although it is recognized that the
secondary airports share multiple funct:ions, and each airport needs a minimum
of maintenance and administration, which normally could not be covered by
revenues generated from the low traffic levels, the Bank and the Government
agreed that a minimum rate of return target should be set for all airports.
This target would ensure that, within a reasonable period of five years, each
airport will make a contribution to revenues after deducting working expenses
and depreciation, such that the Senegalese airport system will earn an over-
all return on net fixed assets in use (revalued from time to time to reflect
current replacement costs) which is notL negative in 1981 and at least 4% in
1984 and thereafter.
6.07      At the same time, in order to permit Dakar airport operations to
provide sufficient cash generation to cover the projected debt service and
finance the airport's future investment needs in a systematic manner, the
Bank and the Government agreed that Dakar airport operations should generate
sufficient revenues to reach a target rate of return on revalued net fixed
assets in use of at least 8% in 1980 and 10% from 1981 onwards. Furthermore,
in order to eliminate an uncontrolled transfer of Dakar airport surpluses to
cover ever increasing operating deficits of the other airports, the Bank and
the Government also agreed that in the future, such transfers would be limited
to a minimum of 10% and a maximum of 15% of gross operating revenue at Dakar
airport. These limits were set following an analysis of Dakar airport's
future cash needs for new investments and renewals with adequate provision for
expected future debt service and working capital needs. The transfer would
be in the nature of a "dividend payment" by Dakar airport in order to provide
the Government with a fair return on its "equity" investment in Dakar airport
infrastructure. The Government and ASECNA have agreed to enter into an
agreement by December 31, 1979 defining the extent and form of the "dividend."
6.08      In order to achieve these financial targets, the Government and
ASECNA agreed on a set of measures set forth in an Action Plan that is part
of the loan documentation. These measures consist of the following:
(a) immediate introduction of paLssenger fees and aircraft service
charges at Cap Skirring and Tambacounda at the same level as
prevails at all other airports;



- 28 -
(b) progressive introduction of such fees at all other secondary
airports that do not impose them at present; and
(c)  adequate revision of tariffs and/or reduction of wo4kiiig
expenses at all airports to achieve the rate of return
targets which are expressed in current units.
The Action Plan is considered realistic and achievable.
D. Future Financial Position
Income Account
6.09      Under the above financial targets and consequent upon the impact
of the proposed measures in the Action Plan, ASECNA's forecast income account
from 1979 through 1984 is given in Tables 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04 which provide
for a breakdown between Dakar and other domestic airports. Table 6.04 is
summarized below. Financial assumptions used in preparing the projections are
listed in Annex 2; forecast increases in aircraft movements, average aircraft
weights and number of passengers are given in Tables 6.07 and 6.08.  It is
assumed that landing, aircraft parking, passenger and rental charges will be
increased 15% in 1980 and in 1982, and 10% in 1984.  Staff costs are assumed
to increase 8% p.a. due to increases in personnel and promotions and 10% every
two years due to increases in salaries. Materials and charges are assumed to
increase 2% p.a. due to quantities and 8% p.a. due to inflation. Tables 6.09
and 6.10 give a breakdown of investment and relevant depreciation provisions
for civil works, terminals and buildings, and radio aids and equipment, for
Dakar and other airports respectively.
6.10      Under the effect of the Action Plan measures, Dakar airport opera-
tions are expected to remain profitable and show a rate of return on revalued
net fixed assets in use of 12% by 1984. The consolidated return for the air-
port system as a whole is also expected to reach a positive level in 1981
and increase progressively to over 5% by 1984. Such a result could not be
achieved unless there are additional revenues generated by the secondary air-
port system. Although, these additional revenues generated by the secondary
airports are small in relation to the increase in their working expenses,
they are nonetheless sufficient to reduce the level of Government net subsidy
payments from about CFAF 193 million in 1979 to about CFAF 108 million by
1984. At the same time, Dakar airport's contribution to cover the operating
deficit is limited by the terms of the "dividend agreement." Moreover, the
projections, which are in current terms, assume a slower buildup of the
working expenses of the other airports as compared to the near doubling in
six years of Dakar airport working expenses. ASECNA will therefore need to
maintain close control of secondary airport operations in order both to meet
the rate of return target and to minimize the demands on the Government budget
transfer.

Source and Application of Funds
6.11      The projected source and application of funds statement, derived
from the above forecast of income and under the assumptions shown in Annex 2
is given in Tables 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13 for Dakar, Other Airports and Total
System respectively.
6.12      As is evident from the above, the implications of the Action PLan
are the following:
(i)  ASECNA will be able to finance major new investments 1/ at
Dakar airport of about CFAF 3,820 million beween 1981-1984 and
provide for about CFAF 750 million of annual renewals over the
1979-1984 period.
(ii)  The net Government subsidy after taking into account the
limited transfer of Dakar airport surpluses will drop from
CFAF 571 million between 1979-81 to about CFAF 359 million
during 1982-84.
(iii)  Dakar airport operations after providing a maximum contribution
during 1979-84 totalling CFAF 1,835 million (or 15% of total
revenues) would show a net increase in working capital over
1979-84 of CFAF 2,087 million.
(iv) The total airport system will show a net increase of working
capital over 1979-84 of CFAF 2,087 million.
Thus, there would be more than adequate provision for future investments and
renewals, not only at Dakar but at other secondary airports as well. ASECNA's
debt service capacity would remain very adequate rising above 2 in 1981 and
increasing to 2.6 by 1984.
Balance Sheet
6.13      ASECNA's consolidated balance sheet resulting from the above analysis
is given in Table 6.06 and summarized below for selected years:
1/   These include extension of the terminal building, a new parking apron
and new taxiways to handle expected future traffic increases.

6.14      This analysis shows that under the impact of Action Plan increases,
ASECNA's financial position will be acceptable at the start of project
execution and at its completion and will improve substantially thereafter.
D. Risk Analysis
6.15      A sensitivity analysis of the financial forecasts was conducted to
test the impact of a possible decrease in ASECNA's cash generation and/or an
increase in the cost of the project on ASECNA's forecast cash position.  The
analysis was carried out assuming the combined effect of:
(a) a 20% decrease in gross revenues generated by landing fees;
(b) a 25% decrease in gross revenues generated by passenger fees; and,
(c) a 10% increase in the cost of the proposed project.
Table 6.14 presents the yearly evolution of ASECNA's sources and applications
of funds should all three sensitivity assumptions materialize simultaneously.
6.16      The table shows that ASECNA's cumulated applications of funds would
exceed sources by about CFAF 931 million over 1979-82 and by an additional
CFAF 371 million over 1983-84. These deficits occur with Government subsidies

substantially below present levels and with the assumed new investments at
Dakar in addition to the proposed project. Should revenues fall substantially,
either through loss of traffic or through inability to effect timely tariff
increases and should, in addition, the working expenses increase as forecast,
ASECNA would be able to scale down or delay future investments at Dakar to
reflect a slower traffic buildup, thereby reducing cash needs during 1982-84.
At the same time, a reduced revenue generation at Dakar would imply a higher
subsidy payment by Government as the contribution from Dakar operations are
limited to 15% of total gross revenues. These higher subsidies are not re-
flected in Table 6.14.  A combination of the above two measures would sub-
stantially increase sources and decrease applications of funds and maintain
working capital at or near 1978 levels.  However, to prevent ASECNA's present
and future borrowing for airport investments in Senegal from expanding beyond
a safe level, ASECNA and the Government have agreed that ASECNA will nol: incur
any long-term debt in addition to thaLt relatd to the project, unless its net
cash revenue for the fiscal year or twelve months immediately before the date
of incurrence, whichever is greater, is 1.25 times the maximum debt service
requirements of any succeeding year on all debts, including the debt to be
incurred, unless otherwise agreed upon with the Bank.

(para. 6.07);
(g) unless otherwise agreed upon with the Bank, ASECNA will not
incur any long-term debt in addition to that related to the
project, unless its net cash revenue for the fiscal year or
twelve months immediately before the date of incurrence,
whichever is greater, is 1.25 times the maximum debt service
requirements of any succeeding year on all debts, including
the debt to be incurred, (para. 6.16).

SECOND AVIATION PROJECT
Detailed Description of Project
1.        The main runway taxiway and aircraft parking apron at Dakar Airport
were built in 1958-59 of portland cement concrete. The ground on which the
airport is built ranges from rock, windblown sand, and highly plastic clays to
clays in the process of lateritization. The original runway was 2,900 m long
and 45 meters wide with sub-surface drainage. This runway was extended under
the first project by 600 m to provide a runway of 3,500 m with 100 m stopways
at either end. The taxiway connects the runway to the apron and is 22 m wide.
2.        The pavement was designed for early jet aircraft.  With the advent
of heavier aircraft and a steady increase in the number of movements of these
aircraft, progressive failure of the concrete slabs has taken place and ASECNA
records show that the rate of failure is accelerating. As the drainage system
is operative and the pavement cracks have been sealed, the failure of the
slabs is attributed to excessive stress.
3.        In the face of this situation, the Government and ASECNA can do
nothing, reduce take off weights to prevent further deterioration, or reha-
bilitate the pavement to take the increased traffic at full loads. Senegal
and ASECNA have elected to rehabilitate the pavement. In the do-nothing case
steadily increasing maintenance costs would be incurred for patching and
sealing cracks with the risk that slabs would have to be replaced when a
dangerous situation arose, with inconvenience to the airlines and revenue
loss to the airport. The second alternative would negate the advantage of the
longer runway built under the first project and would lead to airlines seek-
ing alternative routes by-passing Dakar. This would be detrimental not only
because of the direct loss of revenue and jobs but would have an indirect
impact on the economy of the city of Dakar.
4.        The rehabilitation of the runway will consist of a pavement overlay
of asphaltic cement concrete. In evaluating the overlay three factors were
considered. The financial implications, the minimum thickness to reduce
reflection cracking, and the possibility that the airport might be relocated
in the future. As asphaltic cement concrete would be used with minimum
interference to aircraft operations and the design adjusted to give sufficient
protection for 15 to 20 years at a reasonable cost, a flexible overlay was
selected in preference to portland cement concrete construction.
5.        The taxiway has suffered even more severely than the runway; some
remedial work was done (as well as to runway) during the first project. How-
ever these repairs are deteriorating and proper repairs are required. In one
area of the taxiway, complete sub-grade failure has occured due to a localized
drainage problem. The proposed project includes correction of the drainage
and repair of the taxiway.

ANNEX I

6.        The geometry of the runway taxiway and apron is such that delays can
occur under certain conditions due to conflicting traffic on the single taxi-
way. It would be necessary to construct a second taxiway from the west-end
of the apron then parallel to the runway to the southern (take-off) end to
eliminate the problem. Available evidence does not indicate that the delays
now experienced justify this work at present, and it is proposed to defer
this major cost item. However, in carrying out the repairs to the taxiway the
project will include an adjustment to the alignment of the short high-speed
turn-off to remove one source of conflict and provide clearance for taxiing
wide-bodied aircraft.
Air Senegal's operations show low utilization of aircraft, and the
project seeks to improve this situaticon by increasing its night-flying cap-
abilities. Cap Skirring, a tourist center, has been relying to an increasing
extent on night flights to and from Dakar airport to provide direct connec-
tions with European flights and thus eliminate the need to house passengers
temporarily in Dakar. The Government, through ASECNA, has carried out imrprove-
ments to the airport. A small, efficient new terminal complex has been pro-
vided and improvements to the runway have just been completed.  Due to the
urgency of the situation, the Government has decided to install runway light-
ing as quickly as possible in order to be prepared for the 1978-79 winter
season. The Government has requested that the project provide a visual
approach slope indicator system (VASIS) which is an extremely useful aid under
the conditions existing at Cap Skirring. Adequate, reliable power is avail-
able from the nearby Club Mediterranee, and stand-by power for both the runway
lighting and the VASIS will not be required at this time.
8.        At Ziguinchor, the economic center of the Casamance area of Senegal,
it is expected that the airport will continue to play a steadily increasing
role in the development of the area. Available information suggests that
general development, including agriculture, will be the main factor in its
growth, not tourism.  The airport will remain a very important link with Dakar
as it is essential that this relatively isolated area should have quick and
secure connections with the rest of the country for political, economic,
administrative and development reasons. The location of the airport does pose
some problems, and it is felt that in,vestment in the airport which although
very necessary should be limited until the situation is clarified. Accord-
ingly, the project includes equipment procurement and installation only as
this can, if necessary, be relocated.
9.        The project includes the procurement and installation of a VOR to
replace equipment which is obsolete and difficult to maintain and the instal-
lation of a medium intensity runway lighting system together with a VASILS to
provide a reliable and effective night landing capability. The airport's
power supply will be improved by rep:Lacing the old stand-by power plant and
relocating the new one on airport grounds. The existing plant is located in
town and, although carefully maintained, it is obsolete and has only a manual
change over system.

SECOND AVIATION PROJECT
The Financial Outlook for Operations of Minor Airports
Background
1.      The first part of the financial chapter of this report analyzes
ASECNA's past and present financial performance and financial situation.
Based on this analysis, traffic projections (para. 2.09) and on the antici-
pated impact of the proposed project, the second part of the chapter forecasts
ASECNA's financial performance through 1984. The forecast shows that the
profits anticipated from the operation of Dakar Airports are not expected to
offset the losses incurred by the other Senegalese Airports prior to 1983.
As long as it will be necessary to operate low traffic airports to maintain
communications with isolated areas, it will be impossible to eliminate the
deficit. The objective of this annex is to analyze the deficit, suggest
actions to reduce it and to propose a system.
The Senegalese Minor Airports' Capability to Generate Additional Revenues
2.      The attached table shows the income account of the 4 most important
of the 14 minor airports plus the other 10 by nature of activity from 1976
through 1978. The airports can be divided into three groups according to
passenger traffic.
A.      Airports handling between 15,000 and 20,000 passengers per annum.
This group comprises the two Casamance airports of Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring.
Traffic consists mainly of tourists flown by foreign airlines to Dakar and
then flown by Air Senegal to the Casamance tourist resorts. Air Senegal pays
landing fees for Ziquinchor only and passengers pay fees only when taking off
from Dakar for Casamance. There should be no problem charging Air Senegal
landing fees for Cap Skirring and passenger fees for taking off from both
Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring. Had these fees already been imposed, they would
have reduced Ziguinchor's 1978 deficit of CFAF 67 million and Cap Skirring's
1978 deficit of CFAF 50 million by about CFAF 5 million each.
B.      Airports handling between 1,000 and 3,000 passengers per annum.
The Saint Louis and Tambacounda airports constitute this group.  According to
a study on Air Senegal's costs and earning capacity carried out in February
1977 by the Bureau d'Organization et Methodes of Senegal assisted by an I.L.O.
expert, Air Senegal generates a small profit on the Dakar-Saint Louis route
and should consequently pay landing fees. The same applies to the Tambacounda
airport once the Dakar-Tambacounda route is reorganized into a circular flight
serving Tambacounda and Saint Louis with stops at small intermediate airports.
As in group (A) airports, passengers taking off from either Saint Louis or
Tambacounda should pay a fee. Given the rudimentary facilities provided by
the two airports, departing passengers could be charged only a small fee. The
additional revenue generated from the proposed charges would reach about CFAF
3 million per annum for each airport under 1978 traffic and tariff conditions.

C.      Airports handling fewer than 1,00C pa6senAers pj.r annum.  The
following airports constitute this group: Bakel, Kolda, Simenti, Kedougou,
Richard Toll, Kaed, Matam, Podor, Kaolack and Niokolo-Koba. They are mainly
used for Government purposes and do not generate any profit to Air Senegal.
There is consequently no reason to levy landing or passenger fees.
3.      Had the above potential revenues been realized, they would have
reduced the CFAF 339 million deficit for 1978 by about CFAF 16 million, i.e.
5%. The deficit could most probably have been further reduced by savings in
operating costs and by having users pay for partial utilization of secondary
services provided by the airports.
Possible Savings in Operating Expenses
4.      The table shows a breakdown of minor airports' operating expenses
between airport navigation, infrastructure maintenance, meteorology and over-
heads. The last item is mainly each airport's contribution to the financing
of ASECNA Senegal's headquarters at Dakar. The table also shows the number
of staff employed at each airport in Airport Navigation and Meteorological
Services. While traffic has been fairly constant over the three years under
consideration, staff working in airport navigation has increased by 35%--from
88 in 1976 to 119 in 1978. The major increases have taken place at low
traffic airports like Saint Louis and Tambacounda. A careful investigation
of these increases would likely disclose over-staffing and consequently
leave room for possible savings in operating costs.
5.      The number of staff and the cost of meteorological services have
remained fairly constant from 1976 through 1978. However, the information
provided by ASECNA's meteorological department does not benefit the airports
alone. Several Government agencies, e.g. the National Meteorology Department
and the Radio and T.V. Broadcasting System, take advantage of it and should
contribute to the department's costs. This would provide another opportunity
to reduce minor airports' deficit and consequently decrease their need for
subsidies.
Subsidizing the deficit of the minor airports
6.      Under the present system the minor airports' deficit is subsidized
partly by a fixed annual Government allocation and the rest from Dakar Airport's
profits. This system has two drawbacks: (a) It prevents Dakar Airport from
using its profits to finance investments, thereby forcing it to borrow; and (b)
by providing a fixed annual subsidy notwithstanding the actual deficit of the
minor airport system, the Government does not pay enough attention to the size
of the deficit and consequently does not take action to reduce it.

ANNEX III

7.      There is no doubt that Dakar Airport should temporarily help subsidize
the deficit of Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring airports because the tourist traffic
provides Dakar with a relatively large number of additional passengers but
every effort should be made to increase revenues and reduce costs to the point
that no subsidy is required. There is., however, no reason for obliging Dakar
Airport to subsidize the other domestic airports which carry low traffic
volumes, serve mostly isolated places and are mainly used for Government
purposes without increasing Dakar's traffic. Accepting these premises, the
1978 deficit of the system could be offset by a CFAF 117 million subsidy from
Dakar Airport (Zinguinchor, CFAF 67 million; Cap Skirring, CFAF 50 million)
and by a CFAF 221 million government subsidy. The latter could have been
reduced by about CFAF 20 million if the additional revenues and savings in
operating costs described in paras. 3 to 5 had been implemented.
8.        The appraisal mission discussed with ASECNA and the Government the
deficit of the minor airports, remedial action and the provision of subsidies
by Dakar Airport and the Government along the lines explained in para. 7. The
latter agreed in principle on a new system under which the Government alone
would be responsible for offsetting the deficit of domestic airports.
