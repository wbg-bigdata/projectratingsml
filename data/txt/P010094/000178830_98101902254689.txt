REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR
A SEED PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (GOP) for the equiv-
alent of US$23.0 millicon on standard IDA terms to help to finance a project
for the production, prcocessing and distribution of high-quality agricultural
seed. Approximately US$8.7 million of the credit w uld be on-lent to the
Provinces of Punjab ancl Sind for 20 years at 8% p.a. for the establishment
of two new Seed CorporaLtions and US$4.0 million would be onlent to private
see growers through cosmmercial banks for eight years at 11% p.a.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report,"Recent Trends and Development
Prospects in Pakistan" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976), is being distributed
to the Executive Direct:ors concurrently with this report. Country data sheets
;7 attached as Annex iX.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an
average annual rate of more than 6% during the decade of the 1960's. In
the Second Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial
growth of 13% per annwua. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural out-
put grew at 6.2% annua:Lly with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties, compared wil:h less than 4% in the first half of the decade, but
the industrial growth rate fell to 8.6%.   During the 1970's, however, the
growth rate has been considerably lower. During fiscal years 1970/71 and
1971/72, there was virtually no change in total output as political uncer-
tainties and the confl:Lcts culminating in the separation and independence
of East Pakistan resull:ed in a decline in industrial activity, while drought
virtually halted agricuiltural growth. Since the return of civilian rule in
late December 1971, growth has been modest.   After two years without growth,
the GNP grew by 7% in ]?Y1973, but the increase declined to 5% in FY1974 and
in FY1975 it was less tihan 3.0%. The industrial expansion was the result
primarily of fuller utLlization of capacity.
4.        In FY1975, Pikistan suffered a series of setbacks.   These included
record low river flows reducing irrigation and hydroelectric power, a deteri-
oration of about 20% ill the terms of trade, and falling export demand caused
by the general world recession. In addition, because of damage to the

stilling basins repairs to the Tarbela Dam have taken longer than expected
and irrigation potential will probably not be available till late in FY1976.
However, there have also been important positive developments, including an
acceleration of public investment, some upturn in private investment, growing
economic ties with, and capital flows from, the Middle East oil-producing
countries, the reopening of relations with Bangladesh, and prospects for a
slowdown in world and domestic inflation.
5.        In FY1975 the output of the major agricultural crops may have
declined by 3% or more owing to lack of water. River flows during the
1974 summer crop season were the lowest in the past 90 years and fall
and early winter canal supplies were only 40% to 50% of normal. Heavy rains
in the summer of 1975 make prospects for FY1976 quite bright. Good harvests
are expected for rice and sugarcane, although some flooding in Sind Province
will reduce cotton production. In late 1974 the government lowered agricul-
tural export duties and in early 1975 it announced higher procurement prices
and higher prices to consumers, which will encourage agricultural output and
eliminate some food subsidies. Procurement prices will probably need to be
raised further, however, in order to give sufficient incentive to production.
Other government programs which should assist agricultural growth are those
to improve seeds and cultural practices, to provide more power for tubewell
water supplies and to reduce water-logging and salinity. With the increasing
desire of small and medium-scale farmers to participate in the "green
revolution", agricultural growth in the next five years could accelerate
if appropriate government pricing and other policies and programs are
followed. Substantial increases in production in FY1977 can be expected when
water from the Tarbela reservoir becomes available.
6.        Domestic savings rates have declined steadily since 1969/70,
dropping from 13% to 5.6% of GDP in FY1975. Private savings declined from
12.1% to 6.5% of GDP over the same period while public savings has moved
from +1% to -1% of GDP. Public saving will have to be substantially increased
if a satisfactory rate of growth in the future is to be maintained and
excessive reliance on external borrowing avoided. In recent months, the
government has taken some significant steps to reduce subsidies, restrain
other non-development expenditures, and to increase revenues from Govern-
ment enterprises. These have included substantially higher prices for
wheat, vegetable ghee and sugar, a doubling of the price of natural gas,
and higher electric power and petroleum product prices.
7.        After more than a decade during which prices rarely rose more
than 2-3% annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of
20% to 30% annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the
money supply has been limited to about 14% annually by monetary and fiscal
restraint. At the same time (late 1973) that these restraints began to
curb domestic inflation, however, international prices began to increase
sharply. The dollar prices of imports rose by 37% in FY1974 and by a
further 20% in FY1975. Dollar export prices rose 52% in FY1974, but declined
by 2% in FY1975. With the presently lower rates of international inflation,



- 3 -
however, the rate of price increase in Pakistan has declined. From April
to September, 1975, the wholesale price index increased by less than 1%,
compared with a 24% increase during the same period in 1974.
8.        The deterioration in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting
from increased imports, particularly of wheat, and the adverse changes in
the terms of trade, are reflected in an increase in the current account
deficit plus debt repayment from US$239 million in 1972/73 to US$665 mil-
lion in 1973/74 and an estimated US$1,378 million in 1974/75. The deficit
in 1974/75 has been financed principally by aid from the Pakistan Consortium
and from OPEC countries, which enabled Pakistan to finance its balance of
payments deficit in 1974/75 with only about US$116 million of short-term
borrowing and some draw-down of net reserves. Indications of aid at the May
1975 meeting of the Pakistan Consortium amounted to about $660 million,
significantly higher than in the previous year. Combined with expectations
of assistance from OPEC countries and other sources, they suggest that long-
term capital receipts may be sufficient to limit new short-term credits
in FY76. In subsequent years, rising agricultural, fertilizer and other
domestic production should moderate the increase in trade deficits, but the
balance of payments situation will be adveprsely affected by rising debt amor-
tization payments, particularly after the end of the debt-relief period in
June 1978.
9.        Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June 1975 amounted
to about US$5.3 bilJLion equivalent, of which US$1.2 billion was undisbursed.
At present Pakistan's debt service problem has been eased by the arrangement
concluded in June 1974 whereby countries participating in the Pakistan Con-
sortium agreed to provide US$650 million equivalent in debt relief over four
years. In FY75 the debt service ratio to export earnings and non-factor
service and factor Lncome receipts was almost 18%. However, with the end
of the debt relief arrangement in FY79, Pakistan's debt service ratio must
be expected to increase somewhat. It is therefore important that Pakistan
should make every eEfo-rt to increase its domestic savings and exports and
that borrowing on conventional terms should be held to the minimum. For this
reason the major pa;rt of Bank Group qperations in Pakistan consists of IDA
loans. All the projects scheduled for Pakistan this year, apart from the
power transmission Loan approved on February 10, will be financed by IDA
credits. Including undisbursed amounts, Pakistan's debt to the Bank and
IDA now represents about 16% of its external public indebtedness; by 1980
this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%. The share of the Bank Group in
total debt service (after taking account of the debt relief which Pakistan
will receive from other creditors) is now about 23%, but is expected to
decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
10.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclu-
sive of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the
former East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.2 billion. During
its long association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in



-4-
almost all sectors of the economy. Through FY75, 43% of total commitments
were for public services, 24% for agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for
industrial imports and 1% for education. Lending for public services has
amounted to nearly US$500 million and has included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, gas pipe.iLes, Karachi Port, highways, telecom-
munications and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agricul-
ture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry has been
mainly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
(PICIC). For most projects for which loans and credits are being disbursed,
construction is now going ahead satisfactorily. The principal problems
being encountered are that the rates charged by some of the public services
have not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some utilities are not earn-
ing the return which they need. Furthermore, some institutions have finan-
cial problems arising from the loss of assets in the former East Pakistan.
These problems are the subject of current discussions between the Bank and
the Government. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and
IDA credits as of December 31, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
11.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.    One
of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the economy, to
increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains, edible oils,
fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial
and agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for
industry will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC,
the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the National Develop-
ment Finance Corporation (NDFC) which provides finance primarily for indus-
tries in the public sector. The most important part of future lending for
agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new program to increase
productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity and improving the
utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The Bank is the Executing
Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for improving agriculture and
water planning in the Indus Basin.
12.       Another objective is to continue to improve the institutions which
are responsible for the principal public services which have benefitted
from Bank Group lending in the past, namely, the Telegraph and Telephone
Department, Water and Power Development Authority, Pakistan Railways and Sui
Northern Gas Pipelines Company. In most of these, institutional improvements
are being made with technical assistance financed by the Bank Group.
13.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This proposed shift,
which implies increased lending for agriculture and rural development, will
be accompanied by a significant movement away from concentration on the
massive Indus/Tarbela works toward smaller-scale, more staff-intensive proj-
ects throughout the sector and the country. Although not yet reflected in



-5-
the record of loans and credits approved, this shift has, in fact, already
occurred in terms of staff time devoted to the preparation of projects in
rural development, livestock and forestry. The Government is giving increasing
attention to rural development and the Bank has sent a number of missions
to discuss the rural development program with both the Federal and Provincial
Governments. The implementation of the rural development program is still in
an early stage, however, and is largely dependent upon the initiative of the
Provinces. A project for Bank Group financing is currently under preparation
in Azad Kashmir.
14.       At the Government's request, Bank missions have been working with
municipal authorities on the plans for the urban development of Karachi,
whose population now exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master plan was completed
in 1974 with the assistance of consultants financed by UNDP, and urban
projects are being developed within the framework of this plan, In view
of the preparatory work which has already been done on urbanization prob-
lems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile participation by
the Bank Group in this area, beginning with a project in the Lyari section
of the city. The Government has also asked the Bank to study urbanization
problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in Lahore is
at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is for technical
assistance.  A mission to examine problems of urbanization and regional
development of smaller cities on a country-wide basis visited Pakistan in
March 1975.
15.       Among the projects now being prepared   for your consideration are
an irrigation and drainage project, a livestock project, a third education
project, a second water supply and sewerage project in Lahore and an urban
project in Karachi. All of these projects have been appraised. Preparatory
work is also proceeding on a loan for a fertilizer project, in which IFC
may also participate, and on further irrigation and drainage projects, as well
as the rural development project.
16.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million by
equity participations. (These are shown in Annex II.) About US$11 million
remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the
field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN PAKISTAN
17.       The report, "Special Agriculture Sector Review" (922a-PAK, dated
January 28, 1976), prepared by a recent Bank agricultural sector mission
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 1, 1976. Agriculture
is the mainstay of the Pakistan-economy, accounting in FY75 for about
33X of the Gross Domestic Product and at least 35% of export earnings.
It provides direct employment for some 65% of the country's entire labor
force, with an important indirect contribution through the employment



- 6 -
of an additional 20% in secondary and tertiary activities. Irrigated agri-
culture dominates the sector accounting for some 90% of national farm output.
18.       Wheat, the staple food crop in Pakistan, is cultivated on a total
of about 15 million acres, of which 11 million, mostly irrigated, are planted
with high yielding varieties (IIYV). In 1967/68, GOP imported 42,500 tons of
high yielding variety wheat seed from Mexico. This was sown on about 1.2 mil-
lion acres and thereafter spread so rapidly by farmer to farmer exchange that
by 1973 almost 9.6 million acres were being grown. Distribution of this new
variety coincided with a succession of good winter seasons and the result has
been an impressive jump in area and yields. Yields have subsequently fallen,
due mainly to deterioration in seed quality through mixing. At present strong
and short strawed HYVs of both directly introduced Mexican and locally bred
varieties are available and are a satisfactory base for the seed industry in
Pakistan.
19.       Rice is grown almost entirely in Sind and Punjab, in roughly equal
amounts, and in a small area of the Swat valley of North West Frontier Province
(NWFP). About 50% of the country's total rice area of 4 million acres is
planted with IIYVs, about 20% with Basmati (mainly in Punjab) - a long grained
aromatic variety commanding a premium price - and the remainder is local
coarse-grained types grown mostly in Sind. About 30% of the crop, mostly
Basmati, is exported and is now a major earner of foreign exchange (about
US$225 million in 1974). The available varieties are an adequate base on
which to start commercial multiplication; moreover, the rice breeders are
currently testing a wide range of new strains.
20.       Maize is cultivated on about 1.5 million acres.   About one-quarter
is grown rainfed in the hills of NWFP, a further 0.5 million acres is grown
in the irrigated Peshawar region also in NWFP, and the rest spread throughout
Punjab with concentrations in the Sargodha and Lahore Divisions. The area
under improved varieties is negligible and yields have not increased from
the average of 0.5 tons/acre over the last ten years. However, improved
varieties, mostly synthetic composites with emphasis on early maturity, are
now available and merit multiplication.
21.       Cotton is a major cash and export crop cultivated on about 5.5
million acres, almost entirely irrigated - 4.3 million in Punjab and 1.2
million acres in Sind. Some 96% of the area is in American Upland type while
the remainder is in Desi, a local, coarse and short-stapled type. Yields
have improved gradually over the past ten years but are still poor - averag-
ing about 285 lb/acre in Punjab and 375 lb/acre in Sind compared to 630 lb/
acre in Egypt. Low yields stem mainly from low plant populations resulting
from the use of poor seed. Lint quality and uniformity has suffered through
varietal admixture of seed. A range of improved varieties suited to different
ecological zones is available and it is expected that a new variety with
longer staple and wide adaptability will be released soon.
22.       Vegetables, grown on about 300,000 acres, represent high-value
cash crops and provide an important element in the local diet. However,



because of varietal mixtures and poor seed quality, yields and quality tend
to be low. Potatoes are grown to a limited extent in all four Provinces,
but their area could expand rapidly if virus-free seed of high yielding
varieties were made available to farmers.
23.       Most farmers use their own seed of wheat and rice or barter with
fellow farmers. Probably no more than 10% of farmers (mostly the larger,
more progressive and commercially oriented ones) currently obtain seed from
commercial sources. Purchases increase when new and proved varieties
become available. With maize, however, farmers purchase more than 30% of
their seed requirements.
24.       Initial attempts to establish a seed industry, first by the Pakistan
Department of Agriculture and later by the Agricultural Development Corpora-
tion (ADC), were not successful. The quality of seed distributed was
unacceptable to farmers, rarely being better in performance than ordinary
grain commonly used by farmers for sowing. Generally unsatisfactory per-
formance by ADC led to its dissolution in 1972 and the subsequent transfer
of its major functicns to provincial organizations. However, seed quality
both physically and in genetic purity has continued to be poor.
25.-      The establishment of an effective seed industry and the introduc-
tion of radical improvements in the output and distribution of improved
seed are required tc, support GOP's plans for development of Pakistan's
agricultural sector. The proposed project should lead to a significant in-
crease in total crop production and yield direct benefits to a large number
of small farmers.
PART IV - TIIE PROJECT
26.       The propos;ed project, to be implemented during FY76-80, was appraised
in November/December 1974. The Appraisal Report (No. 781a-PAK) on the project
is being distribute(d separately. A credit and project summary is attached as
Annex III. Negotial:ions took place in Washington during September 1975. The
Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. Asif Rahim, Additional Chief Secretary
(Development), of the Punjab Provincial Government. As agreed at negotiations,
presentation of the proposed credit for your consideration was made conditional
upon, inter alia, tI'e establishment of Provincial Seed Corporations in Punjab
and Sind and the appointment of a Managing Director for each Corporation.
These steps were substantially completed late in February.
Project Components and Implementation
27.       The project would represent the first phase in the development of a
modern seed industry in Pakistan involving research, variety release, seed
multiplication, processing, certification, storage and marketing. Project



- 8 -
activities are to be decentralized on a provincial basis. In addition to
initiating commercial-scale production of cereal and cotton seed in Punjab
and Sind, the project would finance pilot projects for vegetable and potato
seed production in Baluchistan, NWFP and Punjab and establish and/or equip a
National Seed Certification Agency, Registration Agency and research insti-
tutes.
28.       In Punjab and Sind, public-sector Seed Corporations would be
equipped under the project, and will operate along commercial lines with
business policy entrusted to Boards appointed by the Provincial Governments.
The Corporations would process and market seed grown by private farmers on
more than 300,000 acres located in six project areas in the two provinces.
Project areas have been selected on the basis of their topographic and
climatic suitability, the availability of irrigation facilities, access to
transport and the presence of an adequate number of progressive farmers
interested in becoming registered seed growers. Annual seed production at
the end of the five-year project period would total about 103,000 tons,
including 60,700 tons of wheat, 36,500 tons of cotton, about 2,500 tons
each of rice and maize, plus small amounts of other crops. Expected demand
for seed and constraints in organizing the complementary activities that
must be undertaken to ensure production and processing of high-quality seed
have determined the proposed size and scope of the project. The project
includes funds for the development and improvement of farms of both the
Corporations and individual seed growers, including the provision of tube-
wells and tractors where these are needed.
29.       Pre-basic (nucleus) seed would be produced by Provincial Research
Institutes and at the experiment station of the Pakistan Central Cotton
Committee (PCCC). Basic (foundation) seed would be grown mainly at the Seed
Corporation's own farms on land to be acquired from the Extension Departments.
Only small amounts of land would be required for the pilot projects in
Punjab, Baluchistan and NWFP and this is available to the respective Departments
of Agriculture. The project would finance the purchase of small-scale pro-
cessing machinery for use by the Research Institutes in improving handling of
pre-basic seed.
30.       The Seed Corporations would select and register seed growers
and provide services to them, as well as take full responsibility for process-
ing, packaging and storage of seed. The Corporations would buy grain seed
grown for certification from registered growers at a premium of about 20%
above prevailing market prices. Cotton seed grown for certification would be
procured from growers at a premium of about 16%. These premia would be set
to compensate farmers for the additional effort required to grow seed suit-
able for certification. Corporation plants would process all basic and
certified seed; approved cotton seed would be ginned at existing private
ginneries under contracts with the Corporations but further processing would
be a Corporation responsibility. The project will finance the cost of factory
buildings and processing machinery at four plants whose location and total
capacity has been agreed with IDA. Shipment of seed to the factories will
be by private truckers and distributors of processed seed will take delivery



- 9 -
at the plants, thus minimizing the requirements and responsibilities of the
Corporations with respect to transport. The Corporations would also carry
out market research, sales promotion and publicity, and establish retail selling
prices, although actual seed sales and distribution would be entrusted by
the Corporations to public and private sector organizations and firms.
31.       Credit needs of registered growers would be met by local banks
selected and supervised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), which would
provide the necessary funds from the proceeds of the credit and from its
own resources. Under their contracts with growers,.the Corporations would
act as collecting agents for the Banks, although all credit risks and
responsibility for credit management would be borne by the latter. The
major commercial banks in Pakistan -- all of which are now in the public
sector -- are actively seeking to expand their agricultural lending. The
proposed project was discussed with the banks during appraisal and all
expressed interest in the financing of seed growers in the manner outlined.
32.       A National Seeds Council (NSC), with representatives from each of
the Provinces as well as from all public and private parties concerned with
the seed industry, has been established to formulate national seed policy.
Similar Provincial Seeds Councils also exist. The NSC will include a Regi-
stration Agency to be established 'to undertake variety registration. A
National: Seed Certification Agency (NSCA) will implement the seed legislation
which will shortly be enacted by the GOP and will be responsible for main-
taining and enforcing quality control. Enactment of this legislation and
establishment of the NSCA and Registration Agency would be conditions of
effectiveness of the proposed'credit.
33.       Finally, 384 man-months of specialist services and 63 man-months
of consultant services in the fields of seed production, processing and
quality control and for the pilot projects would be provided, as would over-
seas training-for senior project staff.
Costs and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, over the
initial five-year development period would be US$56.5 million (Rs 560 million
equivalent), of which the proposed credit would finance US$23 million re-
presenting the estimated foreign exchange component. The major project
elements, their respective costs and the proposed financing of each are
summarized below (in U;$ million). There is a provision of 3.3% for physical
contingencies and of 41.7% for price contingencies, reflecting an assumed
rate of inflation of 1D% in 1976 declining to 7% in 1980 for equipment and
services and of 14% declining to 10% for civil works.

Corporations. The GOP would also grant to the Provincial Governments a total
of US$2.1 million to cover the cost of tubewell drilling rigs, research,
pilot projects and quality control. GOP would use US$2.0 million for
technical assistance and training. A further US$4.0 million would be onlent
through the SBP and participating local banks to seed growers for their on-
farm development, including acquisition of tractors and installation of
tubewells. Credit proceeds would be onlent by SBP to the commercial banks
for nine years, including two years' grace, at 8% p.a. The remaining US$6.2
million of the credit represents physical and price contingencies and would
be left unallocated.
36.       Local costs would be met by the Provincial Governments, SBP, com-

development funds to the Seed Corporations in the form of equity, and perma-
nent working capital in the form of long-term loans. Seed growers would
meet about 15% (on average) of their on-farm development costs and all their
working capital requirements from their own resources. The remaining 85%
would be made available by SBP to local banks for farm development loans of
eight-year maturity with interest at 11% p.a. This is in line with current
rates for agricultural loans in Pakistan.
Procurement and Disbursements
37.       All processing equipment, tubewell drilling rigs and vehicles
(US$10.5 million) would be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with IDA guidelines. Bids from domestic manufacturers would re-
ceive a margin of preference - 15% or the prevailing customs duty, whichever
is lower. Some 475 tractors required for the project would be procured under
procedures agreed with IDA in connection with previous Agricultural Develop-
ment Bank credits in Pakistan, i.e., through soliciting quotations from
manufacturers on the basis of customer preference. Procurement would be
handled by the Pakistan Tractor Corporation, a government-owned enterprise,



- 11 -
which has a monopoly f-or the import of farm tractors, and which currently
handles about 5,000 a year. Contracts for civil works, because of their small
size and scattered locations, would be let on the basis of local competitive
bidding under procedures satisfactory to IDA. Farm machinery and tubewell
equipment would be purchased by Seed Corporations and seed growers direct
from local suppliers. Bulking and competitive bidding would not be practical
for these items. Local and foreign manufacturers of equipment are adequately
represented and goods are competitively priced. Farm and watercourse improve-
ments would be carried out by the farmers themselves, although some of this,
as well as tubewell drilling, would require engaging local contractors or
seeking the services of the Provincial Departments of Agriculture Engineering.
Technical assistance specialists and services would be engaged in accordance
with IDA guidelines for the selection of consultants. For all contracts in
excess of US$100,000, technical specifications and draft tender documents
would be submitted to IDA for approval before bids are called. A small
number of equipment if:ems costing less than US$20,000 each may be purchased
through normal trade channels, but the aggregate value of such purchases is
not to exceed US$200,000.
38.       Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made against 100%
of foreign expenditures for imported equipment, local expenditures (ex-factory)
for domestically produced equipment supplied under ICB and the foreign-ex-
change cost of technical assistance and overseas training; 60% of the total cost
of other locally procured equipment and supplies; 40% of the total cost of
civil works for buildings, construction and farm development, other than
seed growers' farms; .nd 50% of amounts disbursed under loans to seed growers
for inputs other than imported tractors and equipment.
Financial Projections
39.       In the long term, the prices charged to farmers for high quality
seed must be adequate to cover all the costs of the Corporations. For
cereals, an ex-factory margin' of about 90% over prevailing market prices for
grain will be necessary; in the case of cotton, a 60% margin should be
adequate. Initially, however, seed selling prices will be lower than this
in order to overcome farmers' current distrust of existing commercial seed
and to establish a market for the Corporations' production. It is expected
that all subsidies would be phased out within five years of production. In
the meantime, they would be borne by the Provincial Governments (Section 2.02
of the Sind and Punjab Project Agreements).
40.       Based on the premium payments to growers indicated above and growers'
expected investment in farm development, the financial rate of return from
seed growing would be in the range of 48-59%. This high rate of return
reflects, in part, the! profitability of on-farm investments which alone
could be expected to provide a return of about 35%. The proposed premia
for certified seed are considered the minimum required initially to induce
farmers to participate in seed production, but may be adjusted from time-to-
time in the light of iarmers' response. The financial rate of return on



- 12 -
processing plant investment would be about 15%. All capital costs of the
Corporations during the first five years will be provided in the form of
equity, while permanent working capital will be secured in the form of long-
term loans at 11% p.a. The Corporations should be in a position to retire
these loans by year 15 and to begin paying dividends at that time.
Economic Benefits
41.       The main benefits of the proposed project would be the higher
crop yields obtained by the users of the improved seed produced by the project.
At full production, users of improved seed, replaced at assumed rates, should
obtain yield increases of 20% for maize and 10% for wheat, rice and cotton.
In addition, significant quality improvements and, consequently, better
prices should be realized in the case of cotton. At full development, the
annual increase in production of commercial grain will be about 640,000 tons
valued at US$120 million, while the incremental benefit from cotton is projected
at US$170 million. It is expected that seed resulting from the project will
ultimately be used on 50-60% of Pakistan's cereal areas and on virtually
100% of the cotton acreage. In both cases, most of the gains would accrue
in the form of foreign exchange through higher exports (rice, cotton) and
reduced imports (wheat).
42.       While large, progressive farmers are likely to realize and profit
first from the yield increases made possible by the availability of high
quality seed, on the basis of experience in the late 'sixties when HYVs were
first introduced, it is expected that small farmers will quickly take
advantage of the new seeds also, especially in irrigated areas. It is
estimated that 2.1 million farmers (43% of the total farmer population) should
obtain increased crop yields. Thus, some 13 million people - of whom two
thirds are among the poorest 40% of Pakistan's population - are expected to
benefit from the project. Also, some 100,000 man-years will be required
annually to handle the expanded harvest operations resulting from the intro-
duction of project seed.
43.       With a shadow exchange rate of Rs 11 to the US dollar, with world
prices for crops and imported items and with domestic market prices for all
other items, the economic rate of return of the project is 82%. It remains
high when various alternative, less favorable assumptions are tested and,
in particular, is relatively insensitive to the investment costs and to
the shadow exchange rate. The project is thus well justified under any set
of realistic assumptions. The success of the project, however, will depend
upon the realization and maintenance of high-quality standards for seed.
For this reason, the Borrower and the Association have assigned great im-
portance to the establishment and operation of the National Seed Certifica-
tion Agency.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 50        Education:  US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Effective Date: August 14, 1964; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
Project implementation, originally scheduled for four years has
been delayed by eight years, due to cumbersome administrative procedures,
wars, floods, labor unrest and price escalation. Despite delays and cost
inflation, the total project cost in US dollars will be within the appraisal
estimate because of the devaluation of the Pakistan rupee in 1972. Civil
works are 95% completed; equipment procurement is also virtually completed
except for the Polytechnical Institutes at Sind. The Sind Province is likely
to be able to use only about 75% of the credit funds available for this
province. The technical assistance program has been completed. Disburse-
ments to date amount to 92% of the Credit and are likely to amount to 98%
by June 30, 1976, the final Closing Date.
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2,.1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. The second filling of the reservoir is now in progress.
Agreement has been reached with the Parties to the Indus Basin and Tarbela
Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions would be made
by a number of the parties and IDA to help meet the costs of the repairs
and additional remedial works.
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 5
Loan No. 590         Development Finance Company - PICIC:   US$40.0 Million
Loan of March 21, 1969; Effective Date: May 21, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974 was postponed first to September 30, 1975 and then to
September 30, 1976, the current date, to enable disbursements to be made
for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975 This should help to
improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 157       Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million Credit
of June 26, 1969; Effective Date: September 23, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Although the Closing Date of this credit has passed, minor dis-
bursements are expected to continue into March, 1976, as the last tractors
ordered under the project are.shipped. The Government has requested a fur-
ther credit for ADBP and discussions are taking place concerning the measures
necessary to remedy ADBP's financial and managerial problems.
Credit No. 177       Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing.Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.     The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31,
1977. The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA. Progress has been
achieved on the Bangladesh liabilities issue. The major problem remaining
is the large arrears in IDBP's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquid-
ity. The liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from



ANNEX II
Page 6
the Government but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly
on developments in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion
of IDBP's outstandings. Disbursements amounted to $16.2 million as of
January 10, 1976.
Credit No. 206      Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule. The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete nine months before
the Closing Date (December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment
purchases, which are linked to the Technical Assistance program. This
program, if implemented, will require at least two years extension of
the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment of experts. Progress in
staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because of low staff salaries.
Suggestions for improvement have been made to the Borrower during the
supervision visit. Project costs on civil works are expected to exceed
the appraisal estimates by 85% in rupee terms, but total project costs
are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to
the 1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow but is ex-
pected to improve in FY76 with the completion of the physical facilities.
Credit No. 213       Power Transmission and Distribution:   US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Implementation of the project, which had improved during the
past year, has suffered a further setback and the Closing Date has been
postponed for the second time, to June 30, 1977. The new delay is caused
by additional claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which negotiations
have now been completed.
Credit No. 422-PAK   Third Karachi Port:  US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
The contracts for the construction of four shipping berths and
two transit sheds at Juna Bunder, and for the reconstruction of Napier
Mole Bridge were awarded, in June and October 1975 respectively, to the
same joint venture, National Construction Company (NCC) of Pakistan and
Chriastiani & Nielsen (CN) of Denmark. Site work is due to commence pre-
sently. Materials for permanent way and pipes and fittings have been
ordered, and work on operational buildings is proceeding. However, there
have been delays in appointing consultants for supervision and in com-
mencing other parts of the project, such as the proposed study of KPT's
dredging fleet. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has been committed.



ANNEX II
Page 7
Credit No. 492-PAK  Fourth Karachi Port:   US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
].974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The four bids received for construction of the oil berth have
been reviewed and arE; presently under more detailed assessment by the
consultants & KPT. In view of the bids received, significant cost over-
runs appear likely. Consultants have not yet been formally appointed by
KPT for preparing contract documents for dredging works and dredger pro-
curement. The credit implementation is now some 18 months behind the program
prepared at the time of appraisal. No disbursement from the Credit has been
made to date.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
Progress has been made in solving that problem although some pending matters
are still under discussion with the Government. The other major problem is
the large arrears in PICIC's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity.
The liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from the
Government but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on dev-
elopments in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion of PICIC's
outstandings. Disbursinents amounted to $8.0 million on January 10, 1976.
A new loan is under consideration.
Credit No. 466       Flood Rehabilitation:  US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Effective Date: May 15, 1974; Closing
Dat:e: June 30, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 was post-
poned one year to permit completion of procurement of specialized spare
parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.
Loan No. 988        Multan Fertilizer:   US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Work on major offsites
such as roads, railroad tracks and utilities is complete and plant construc-
tion is proceeding vigorously. Staff recruitment and training is increasing
steadily. The most liketly potential problem appears to be the late delivery
of a few critical items such as boilers, which could delay startup by several
weeks. Performance of the existing calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer
plant continues to be hampered by breakdowns in the old ammonia plants, thus
adding to the need to complete the expansion project with minimum delay.

Credit No. 510      Third Telecommunications:   US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This credit is proceeding satisfactorily though still at an early
stage. Procurement action for all the main equipment items is well-advanced
Reorganization of T&T to a form more suited to its commercial-type operation,
which was an agreement of the first Telecommunications Credit and reiterated
in the Credit Agreement of 510-PAK, has not progressed. A Government ap-
pointed Committee was to have formulated by December 31, 1975, the steps
required to achieve this reorganization.
Credit No. 546      National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):    US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
This credit was made effective on July 17, 1975. No commitments
had taken place as of January, 1976.
Loan No. 1107        Fourth Sui Northern Gas:  US$60.0 Million Loan of
May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Engineering and procurement are on schedule, as in construction,
despite unusually heavy rains and floods during late summer. Progress on
the purification facilities is falling behind original plans. Two problems
facing the Borrower are delivery delays due to congestion at the port of
Karachi and the loss of skilled craftsmen to the Middle East. The project
is expected to be completed on time and well within the estimated cost.
No action has been reported on the government's obligation to make a
