the Bank's prior approval will be required for: (i) a first
extension of the bid validity period if the period of extension
exceeds sixty (60) days; and (ii) any subsequent extension of
the bid validity period.
    (b)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this
Part A, the Borrower shall use or cause to be used the relevant

pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank
prior to the making of the first payment out of the Special
Account in respect of such contract.
    (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the

contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants'
services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall
have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard
contract documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower
shall use other standard forms agreed with the Bank.
