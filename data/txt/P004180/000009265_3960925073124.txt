NAM NGUM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (CREDIT 1197-LA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Nam Ngum
Hydroelectricity Project in Laos, for which Credit 1197-LA in the amount of
SDR 13.0 million (equivalent to US$15.0 million) was approved on December 12,
1980. The Credit was closed on December 30, 1988, three years and three
months behind schedule. An undisbursed balance of SDR 70,242.78 was cancelled
from the Credit effective April 13, 1989. Cofinancing in the amount of US$4.0
million was provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development. An
amount equivalent to US$64,143.95 of the OPEC fund loan remained undisbursed
on the June 30, 1989 withdrawal closing date.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department II and the Energy Division, Technical Department,
both of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and
III), and the Borrower (Part II). A copy of Parts I and III was sent to OPEC
for comments; OPEC has advised that it has no comments on these two parts of
the PCR.
Preparation of this PCR was started in February 1989 and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit and Project
Agreements, supervision reports; correspondence between IDA and the Borrower
and internal IDA memoranda.

LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
NAM NGUM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (CREDIT 1197-LA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
The two main objectives of the project weres (i) to optimize the
output from the Ram Ngnn hydroelectric generating station by installing an
additional 40 r'r turbiue-generator unit and (ii) to have Electricite du Laos
(EDL) reach a satisfactory sales agreement with the Electricity Authority of
Thailand (EGAT). Total costs were estimated at US$20 million of which IDA
would supply US$15 million), the OPEC Fund US$4 million and the Government the
remaining US$1 million (Part I, paras. 3.1-3.3).
Imilementation
The project was implemented by EDL, the Credit beneficiary. The new
turbine-generator unit and its associated plant and civil works weee success-
fully completed on schedule in February 1985. However, the credit closing
date had to be extended three times (from September 30, 1985 to December 31,
1988) because of delays in completing minor components included in the project
and reallocating uncommitted Credit funds for other eligible expenditures,
mainly the rehabilitation of Units 3 an 4 at Nam Ngum (Part I, paras. 5.1 and
5.2).
Results
The project fully achieved the objectives of optimizing power output
from Nam Ngum and selling the surplus electricity to EGAT at a satisfactory
price. As a result, EDL's financial position dramatically improved, and the
EGAT sales became the major foreign exchange earner for Laos. The 16.61
reevaluated internal economic rate of return is only marginally lower than the
17.851 estimated at project appraisal. EDL and EGAT have since entered into a
new sales agreement with substantially lower electricity prices which appear
equitable. One important objective, to reduce the high 241 transmission and
distribution losses to a more reasonable level, has not been achieved. This
issue is being addressed under a loss reduction program included in IDt Credit
1826-LA (Part I, paras. 6.1 and 6.2).
Sustainability
Prospects appear favorable for the continued flow of benefits from
the sales of electricity to EGAT. The Nam Ngum facilities are well designed,
operated and maintained, and Laos has attractive alternate sites to exploit
for power generation.  The main risk is that the sales agreem.nt will be
abrogated or not renewed, but this is not likely since both parties gain from
the agreement (Part I, para. 7.1).



- iii -
Findings and Lessons
The main project was well executed, within the budget and on time,
and benefits appear sustainable for the foreseeable future. However, EDL
cannot afford to neglect future operational and investment requirements,
mainly (Part $II, para. 6.6)s
(a) providing additional electricity generating capacity to satisfy
growing domestic and export needs;
(b) adjusting domestic prices to reflect the export value ef electricity;
(c) providing effective line loss reduction measures; and
(d) keeping power sector investments at au affordable level.

2. BackK-ound
2.1      At the time of project appraisal (1980) the Nam Ngum hydroelectricity
plant was the only electricity source of any consequence in Laos. Total elec-
tricity sales amounted to about 860 GWh, of which 9Z was consumed locally and
the remaining 912 exported to Thailand.  Except for Vientiane where electric-
ity was available, only four other provinces (of the 13 total) had access to
limited amounts of electricity from small diesel and hydro units and modest
imports from Thailand.
2.2      The Nam Ngum plant was erected in two stages:  two 15 MW units were
installed under Phase I. and two 40 MW were installed under Phase II; these units
were put into commercial operation during 1971 and 1978 respectively. The
project under review in this report included provisions for installing a fifth
unit rated at 40 MR. Electricite du Laos (EDL), a wholly-owned state enterprise
charged with responsibility for generating and transmitting electricity through-
out Laos and distributing electricity in the greater Vientiane area, was the
beneficiary of the IDA credit and the entity responsible for executing the
project.
2.3      Laos is the poorest country in the region and one of the poorest in
the world, but its development prospects are encouraging. Extension of the
Nam Ngum plant was a key element in the five year (1981-85) development plan,
which emphasized growth in agriculture, forestry and exports. Sales of
electricity to Thailand in 1980 constituted about 352 of Laos' oil import
bill.
3.       Project Obiectives and Description
3.1      The objectives of the project were to (a) optimize output from the
Nam Ngum generating station by installing an additional 40 MW turbine-
generator, (b) assist EDL and Electricity Authority of Thailand (EGAT) reach a
new electricity sales agreement which would provide a satisfactory rate of



- 2 -
return to EDL; tc) strengthen EDL's organization; (d) study the hydro
potential xi Laos for possible development in cooperating with fThailand, and
(e) study the optizm strategy for extending power supply to provinces other
than Vientiane Province.
3.2      The project included the following components:
(a) installation at the existing Nam Ngum Hydroelectric Plant of:
(i)  a fifth turbine-generator unit (40 MV capacity). together with a
short penstock and an associated intake gate, and hoist and
trash racks;
(ii) ruxiliary equipment including a standby heat exchanger;
(iii) communication equipment; and
(iv) a step-up substation
(b) carrying out of civil works associated with (a) above;
(c) engineering consulting services for (a) and (b) above;
(d) power development studies;
(e) assistance to EDL to reduce electricity distribution losses; and
(f) training of EDL staff and the provision of training tools, metering
equipment and accounting machines.
3.3      In addition to the direct benefits to EDL, the project would mutually
benefit Laos and Thailand and it would help to promote interregional coopera-
tion between the two countries. The average increase in power output attri-
butable to the proposed fifth until of Nam Ngum (145 Gih per year) would be
exported to Thailand in the initial years of plant operations.
4. Proiect Design and Orsanization
4.1      Project design was well conceived; it provided the means for more
fully utilizing the power potential of the Nam Ngum site at minimum cost. No
dam construction and other extensive civil works were required, provisions for
an additional 40 MW turbine-generator unit was taken into account in the
design of the plant and adequate transmission facilities had already been
installed. None of these cost saving advantages could have been realized at a
new dam site. The consultants (a Swiss firm) who had been engaged for the
engineering and construction of the Phase II expansion was also selected by
EDL for the current expansion. These factors contributed to a relatively
trouble free engineering effort and implementation start-up.
5. Project Implementation
5.1      As agreed with the Association during negotiations, EDL formed a
project implementation unit which would let EDL staff fully participate with
the consultants in carrying out the power plant expansion. The head of the



-3-
unit was made responsible for project coordination with the consulting firm's
project manager, and EDL personnel were assigned to work with counterpart
consultants.  This arrangement had been used successfully during the Phase II
expansion. It provided EDL staff with valuable on-the-job training and
experience for the subsequent operation and maintenance of the plant.
5.2      The fifth turbine generator-unit with its associated civil works and
p!ant was successfully completed and commissioned on schedule in February
1985. Typically for a project cf this type, the studies and similar minor
components were not accorded the importance nor subjected to same strict
schedule regime as is the case with plant construction components. Altogether
three extensions to the credit closing date (September 30, 1985 to December
31, 1988) were required because of these minor implementation delays and
reallocation of uncommitted funds, mainly to rehabilitating units 3 and 4.
One delay was caused because no response was received to a number of bid
requests under IDA's international competitive bidding procedures. This
strongly indicates that limited international bidding and international
shopping are more suitable bidding procedures when procuring relatively low
value goods and services. In general, the project also indicates that the
Association needs to supervise the minor components of projects of this sort
with the same intensity as it does the major components.
6. Proiect Results
6.1      The project fully achieved its main objectives which Ware tot
(a) optimize output from the Nam Ngum power station. Successful
completion of the fifth unit provided standby capacity to permit
shutdown and m,intenance of the older units and the growth of local
sales without reducing exports to Thailand. Rehabilitation of units
3 and 4 further reinforced EDL's operation system;
(b) reach a satisfactory agreement with EGAT for electricity sales to
Thailand. The agreement actually made the project possible because
without the agreement there was no justification for installing the
fifth unit. The threefold price increase contained in the agreunent
dramatically improved EDL's financial position; and
(c) strengthen EDL's organization. On-the-job training and other formal
training provided under the Credit substantially improved EDL's
operating and project implementing capabilities.
6.2      The project was an economic success.  It is estimated to yield an
internal economic rate of retutn of 16.6S which compares favorably with the
17.852 rate calculated at appraisal.
6.3      An important objective which was not achieved was the reduction to a
satisfactory level the excessively high 242 losses experienced by EDL's
distribution system at the time of project appraisal. Some improvements were
accomplished, but the losses were only reduced to about 192. As part of the
Southern Provinces Electrification Protect (Credit 1826-LA) EDL agreed to
reduce system losses by implementing a loss reduction program satisfactory to
the Association.



-4-
7. Prolect Sustainabilitv
7.1      The mrajor benefit realized by Laos from the project is the badly
needed foreign exchange earnings made possible by the additional electricity
available for export to Thailand. Prospects for the sustainability of this
project benefit are reasonably good; however, the most recent negotiations
between E1L and EGAT regarding the export price of electricity did result in a
30S rate decrease back to 1981/82 levels. Design and construction of the Nam
Ngum facilities meet strict international standards, and operation and mainte-
nance practices are considered satisfa_tory. An inherent risk to the project
is that one or the other of the two parties may at some future date decide to
abrogate or refuse to renew the electricity sales agreement. This risk,
however, is not very likely in view of the fact that both Laos and Thailand
benefit from the agreement.
8. IDA Performance
8.1      The project's main objective of developing additional electric power
for export at Nam Ngum was an integral part of the Association's strategy of
using limited IDA resources to meet Laos' most pressing development needs. In
this regard, the Association played a discreet but vital role in bringing the
electricity sales contract negotiations between EDL and EGAT to fruition. In
addition, the Association assisted in project preparation and the selection of
consultants for project implementation and studies, and it continued to
provide support throughout the project cycle. Overall, the Association's
performance can be rated as generally cooperative, and in some respects
essential, to the success of the project.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1       t project appraisal EDL lacked trained competent staff at all levels
of its organization, but it was able to carry out the project with the
assistance of consultants. The trained staff shortage has been alleviated by
EDL's training program supported by the Association, UNDP and other donors.
Nevertheless, it will still take time before EDL stiff can develop the skills
to implement any but the less complicated projects without outside technical
and managerial assistance.
9.2      Operationally, EDL has made good progress.  It operates its modern
plant and equipment properly and efficiently, and it conducts regular
maintenance according to generally accepted public utility practices.
9.3      EDL complied st;bstantially with all Credit covenants, but it was
remiss in timely submittal of progress reports and financial statements; and
it was not able to reduce system losses to the level anticipated at project
appraisal.



-5-
10.  Proiect Relationships
10.1     By the time the project was appraised previous Association operations
in Laos had established an atmosphere of mutual confidence and understanding
with the Government. During appraisal this relationship was extended to
include EDL.. The cooperative attitude established with EDL made it possible
to satisfactorily rb olve the various complications which normally arise
during implementation of a project.
10.2     Good relationships were maintained by the Association with UNDP,
OPEC, consultants and other partiiipants in the project. This was also true
of EDL in its dealings with these organizations.
11. Consulting Services
11.1     Taking into account EDL's state of technical and managerial
development at the time, the assistance of qualified consultants was essential
to the execution of the project. This assistance was satisfactorily provided
by the following consulting firms:
(a) Swiss consultants for installation for the Nam Ngum turbine-generator
expansion;
(b) Swiss consultants (not the above) for assisting EDL during the
electricity sales contract negotiations with EGAT; and
Cc) Indian consultants for financial training and carrying out a power
supply and a hydro study.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1     The project's legal agreements adequately reflected the Association's
interests in a satisfactcry execution of the project and in achieving its
development objectives in Laos. The staff appraisal report was comprehensive,
well prepared and provided a useful framework for the Association and EDL
during project implementation.
12.2     A completely analytical approach to this PCR was not possible from
available project documents and data. In particular, some documentation for
the period 1982-85 is either incomplete or missing. Since Bank staff will not
always be assigned to a project for its entire preparation-to-completion
cycle, the necessary background information and data for analytical evalua-
tions should be included in appropriate project documents. Appraisal and
supervision reports are particularly important in this regard; they should be
prepared with the view that a sound foundation is being laid for a future PCR.

LAD PEOPLE'S DENOCRATICE REPUBLIC
10NGUKiN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (CRE-DIT 1197-LA)
PROECT CPLET QIN REPORT
PARt II
1.   Prosegct exacution and nerformance
1.1     Project implementation began in July 1982, and was
completed  mid  December  1984,  7  weeks   behind
schedule.         The    two    month   trial   run
commenced immediately thereafter and the unit
was commissioned in MarchB85.
1.2    Contractors performance:
Delays and difficulties were experienced mainly in
the supply and erection of electrical equipment
under Contract D. Delays in submission of vital
equipment designs by the subcontractor to the
manufacturer and further delays in manufacture and
shipment 'ed to time schedules being exceeded by
approximately  three  months.    The   consultants
further reported that some of the contracted
stores items were not received. The erection work
was finally completed with physical and material
help from other contractors.
1.3     Consultants performance:
The services provided by the consultant assisted
considerably in keeping control over the various
stages  of  implementation  and  adherence to time
schedules.    Quarterly  progress   reports   were
submitted   by  the  consultant  to  the  Bank  in
accordance   with   their   requirements.         The
consultant, however was remiss in the maintenance
of designs, documents and manuals appropriately
indexed and filed, for future reference ty EOL
when necessary.
1.4     Banks performance:
EDL received sustained and timely assistance from
the  Association  in  all  matters.   IDA missions
visited Laos on thirteen occassions between 1980 -
1989.   The loan provided the finance not only for
the Nam Ngum Project but also for promoting the
all round development of EOL.
In   respect   of  OPEC   operations,  some delays
were  experienced   in   obtaining   payments   to
suppliers and consultants, especially during 1988.
OPEC is still in arrears in reimbursing EDL with a
proportion of local costs in accordance with the
terms of the Agreement.



1.5     Subsidiary projects:
Apart from the implementation of Phase III, the
loan included several other components designed to
improve operational efficiency of ECL. These were:
a.  HV line Protection and  Telecommunication
equipment, completed in 1987.
b.  Consultancy services for  S.P.E.  project
(Part only)
c.  Consultancy   services  for tariff study,
completed in 1987.
d.  Consultancy services for installation  of
computer   equipment    and       software
development.
e.  Consultancy.  services for training of EDL
accounts and finance staff, completed in
1986.
f.  Equipment    for    loss   reduction   on
distribution network.
1.6     Delays  were. experienced in implementation of the
following projects:
a.  The programme  of  computerisation    was
substantially delayed as the  tender  for
equipment floated under IS procedures
received no response. EOL was therefore
obliged to follow the direct purchase
procedure and the hardware was finally
installed in February 1989. The software
development programme was also delayed
and currently is due for completion in
December 1989.
b.  Vital   meter  testing equipment required
for  the  implementation  of   the   loss
reduction programme was received only in
April 1989.
2.      Prniect oxoerience and resulls
2.1     The establishment of a project office in charge of
the project manager assisted by an adequate number
of staff was the key factor in the succesful
implementation of the project. Advance planning,
team work and meticulous attention to detail
ensured full control over costs and time schedules
The Project was well executed, in spite of various
delays. It met all important criteria of financial
return, economic and social benefits. These have
been commented on in detail in Part III.
2.2     The EDL  experience  during execution  established
that    the    lowest    evaluated   bid  was  not
neccessarily the best or the cheapest in the long
run.     Deiays,  deficiencies  and  omissions  in
supplies  caused  delays   and   difficulties   in
erection, whiJh in turn led to increased costs
under   counsultant's  man   hours,   replacement
materials,       besides     disrupting      planned
workschedules.



2.3     The   programme    for   achieving  a  significant
reduction in the loss on the distribution net
work    has  been  only  psrtially successful.  In
retrospect, it appears that this can be attributed
to lack of requisite technical experience among
EOL stafff. It may be noted that no consultancy
arrangement  was  entered  into  to   assist   EOL
in  a   planned   practical   approach   to    the
problem.  It is expected that   effective progress
will be made in this programme under the ongoing
SPE project.
2.4     The  programme  of  staff training in accounts and
implementation  of   accounting   procedures   was
concluded  in  1986.    Under  this  training  the
compilation of accounting data has considerably
improved.    However  it  is  realised  that  this
programme was the first step towards building
up   an   efficient   accounting   and  management
imformation system which would effectively meet
tne   -e-Jirements   of   the   rapidly  expanding
operations of  EDL.    The  current  programme  of
institutional development which provides further
training  and upgradation of the accounting system
should assist EOL in achieving this Qbjective.
2.5     The procedure  followed  for  onlending  the  loan
proceeds  to  EDL  at  commercial rate of interest
marked  a   distinct   departure   from   previous
practice.    Finance  costs  are  thus included in
arriving at the unit cost of electricity generated
and also assists in arriving at a tariff rate
which would fetch an adequate economic return to
EDL, and generate internal funds sufficient to
meet debt service requirements. The procedure for
repayment of loan according to fixed schedule also
established that the assets were paid for through
EDL generated funds and did not form part of the
permament Govt. investment in EDL as hitherto.
3.      Conclusion
3.1     The major gain to EDL arising from the  successful
experience of the project lies in its inereasing
confidence to undertake future expansion projects.
This was the first project to be executed by EDL
in its entirety from conception to completion
after 1975. It is a source -of satisfaction that
the principal objectives were achicved within the
financial parameters and time schedules agreed
with the Association.
3.2     The   sustained   development  of  the Lao economy
depends to a great extent on the country's ability
to  increase   its   export   earnings   in   hard
currency  areas.   The success of this project has
made EDL aware of its ability to contribute to
this    development    and   to   its   continuing
responsibility  in the future.

6. Proiect Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.1      The principal direct benefits accruing from the project were the
economic and financial gains realized from the increased capacity to export
electricity to Thailand. The project also contributed to EDL's development
into a competent electrical utility as illustrated by the following:
(a)  When the project was appraised in 1981 EDL's staff numbered about
1,000 employees including at most about 40 members with any
professional training.
(b) By end-1986 EDL staff had grown to about 1,300 including 43 graduate
engineers, 131 technical staff with university degrees (but not in
engineering) and 503 trained skilled workers.
B. Economic Impact
6.2      The SAR evaluated the internal economic rate of return (IERR) as the
discount rate which equalizes the stream of costs and beneiits attributable to
the project. The 17.85X IERR estimated in the SAR was based on the following
conditions:
(a) The agreed price for the sale of Nam Ngum power would be US$ .031 per
KWh from October 1, 1981 with an escalation of 9Z p.a. up to 1986,
when renegotiations were to take place;
(b) Capital expenditures as per the SAR estimate;
(c) O&M costs at 3Z of the capital cost, and
(d) Annual production of additional energy due to the 5th unit would be
145 GWh, resulting in additional sales to Thailand of 130 GWh (about
10X loss).
6.3      A similar approach wias used in this reevaluation of the IERR with the
following exceptions:
(a) Latest estimated capital costs;
(b) Total sales dropped from an average of about 830 GWh annually to 529
GWH in 1987 because of stoppages by EGAT during contract
negotiations. It is assumed that output from the fifth unit fell
proportionately to 80 GWh during 1987; and
(c) Electricity sales to Thailand started on March 1, 1985 and were at
the following prices (US$ per KWh):
-    January 1, 1985 to December 31, 1985:   4.326
-    January 1, 1986 to September 30, 1986:  4.376
-    October 1, 1986 to December 31, 1988:   3.05
-    January 1, 1989 onward:      constant    3.05



- 14 -
6.4      On the basis siat forth above, the IERR is calculated to be 16.62,
only slightly lower than the 17.85S SAR estimate. Annex 1 tabulates the cost
and benefit streams used in calculating the reevaluated IERR. In the absence
of an inflation index for Laos, the Manufacturing Unit Value (MUV) Index
prepared by the Bank (Operations Policy Note 311) was used in converting costs
and benefits to constant US dollars.
C. Financial Impact
6.5      EDL's financial performance comparing actual results with project
appraisal forecasts for the period 1981-86 is presented in Annex 2. EDL's
strong financial performance over this period is directly attributable to the
electricity export agreement negotiated with EGAT in 1981. Since the new
rates went into effect, sales to Thailand have provided the Government with a
major source of foreign exchange earnings.
6.6      Notwithstanding EDL's current financial health, a review of its
financial prospects by an IDA mission in March 1988 found that it faced
increasing future financial constraints which could lead to an operating
deficit by the middle 1990s if a; ropriate counter-measures were not taken.
The mission's financial projections based on actual 1986-87 results and latest
operational and investment plans showed that there was an urgent need tot
(a)  build a new power station to satisfy the growing domestic market and
maintain optimum export levels;
(b) adjust domestic prices to reflect more closely the export value of
electricity;
(c) pursue more effective line loss reduction measures; and
(d) keep power sector investments at an affordable level.
