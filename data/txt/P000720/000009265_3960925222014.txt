DROUGHT RECOVERY PROGRAM
(CREDIT 1576-ET)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Drought
Recovery Program in Ethiopia for which Credit 1576-ET for SDR 31.3 million
(US$30.0 million equivalent) was approved on April 9, 1985. The original
Closing Date of the credit (April 30, 1987) remained unchanged but
disbursements continued for nine months to January 31, 1988. A balance of
SDR 0.26 million was cancelled on March 7, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Division of the Technical
Department of the Africa Regional Office on behalf of the Agriculture
Operations Division in the Eastern Africa Department. It is based on the
draft Report prep&red by the Borrower, discussions held with a project
consultant who was intimately associated with the program, and on a review
of the President's Report and associated Credit documents (correspondences
and supervision reports;.
The draft PCR was sent by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) to the Borrower for comment and a responding letter from one of the
major Implementing agencies is attached to the report.

PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
ETHIOPIA
DROUGHT RECOVERY PROGRAM
(CREDIT 1576-ET)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Irtroduction
l.       Between 1982 and 1984 severe drought conditions persisted
throughout the country with the worst affected regions being Wello,
Tigray, Eritrea, Gonda and Sidamo. It is estimated that by the end of
1984, between 6-10 million people were affected by the drought and needed
relief assistance. Only about 2-3 million could be reached, however,
because of poor infrastructure and transport facilities and civil unrest
in parts of the drought areas, particularly those in the northern part
of the country.
Object1yes
2.       At the Annual Bank-Fund meeting of 1984, the Government of
Ethiopia's (GOE) Finance Minister outlined his country's intentions
towards drought areas. The GOE requested the donor community, the Bank
included, to supplement its efforts in saving the lives of thousands of
starving people. As a result, about 830,000 tons of food and non-food
assistance valued at US$450 million were collected during 1985 and 1986.
The World Bank (IDA) also participated in the relief effort by providing
a credit of US$30.0 million for the Drought Recovery Program. The total
program was estimated to cost US$41.1 million and included provision of
transport facilities, food production inputs, livestock production and
disease control inputs, water supply facilities and technical assistance
support to the Ministry of Agriculture over a period of two years. IDA
processed the program (prepared, appraised, negotiated and approved) in
less than six months.
Imple_ntation Experience
3.       The IDA credit provided foreign exchange for (i) fertilizers,
pesticides and veterinary drugs for peasant farmers; (ii) spare parts for
publIC and private truck fleets and medium size (up to 1.0-ton) four-wheel
drive trucks for the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC); (iii)
pumps, motors, generators, drill rigs and other spare parts to repair and
construct water supply facilities; and (iv) technical assistance.



- v -
4.       The program included the following components:
(a)  Asricultural Inputs. Supply and distribution of 50,000
tons of fertilizers (diammonium phosphate), one year
supply of plant protection chemicals and veterinary
drugs and equipment to enhance food and livestock
production;
(b) Transport Equipment and Spare Parts. Provision of 100
medium size trucks and spare parts to RRC and spare
parts for both public and private trucks associated
with the drought relief effort;
(c) Water SupPlY Equipment and Spare Parts. Provision of
2 drilling rigs, 170 pumps and engines, 90 generating
units, 800 hand operated pump sets and spare parts; and
(d)  Technical  Assistance.      Provision  of  technical
assistance and equipment to the Technical Support Unit
in the Ministry of Agriculture for coordinating
disbursements and progress reporting.
5        The  implementing  agencies - the Agricultural  Inputs  Supply
Corporation (AISCO), the National Road Transport Corporation (NATRACOR)
now called Ethiopia Freight Transport Corporation (EFTC) , and the
Ethiopian Water Works Construction Authority  all supported by the
'Technical Support Unit of MOA '- cooperated to facilitate quick
disbursement of the Lredit.  Distribution of materials procured under
the program was relatively smooth and rehabilitation of water facilities
and construction of new ones progressed well. However, the procurement
of trucks was delayed. This was caused by the Government's desire to
award the second lowest evaluated bidder, contrary to the interna, onal
competitive bidding procedures.   On the insi3tence of the Bank, GOE
finally agreed to procure the vehicles from the lowest evaluated bidder.
The credit component of the project through the Agricultural and
Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) was not implemented, but was not
essential to meet the basic project objectives.
6.       Also, despite IDA's constant requests for audited accounts for
the project, only NATRACOR provided such accounts for the period up to
July 1987.
Results
7.       In general, the program was implemented satisfactorily and the
original objectives were achieved despite delays associated with the
procurement of 100 trucks for RRC and water supply equipment and spare
parts.



- vi -
8.       An economic justification for the program was not presented at
appraisal nor in the PCR because of the short-term nature of the program
and the difficulty of quantifying benefits. These features were similar
to those of the preceding Drought Areas Rehabilitation Project (Credit
485-ET) in Ethiopia.
Sustainability
9.       Being of an emergency nature, the project was not designed
with the intention of being sustainable. It was part of a program by
the international donor community to assist Etrhiopia in a crisis
situation following successive drought years.
Findings
10.      The main findings of the project are:
(a) In emergency projects of this nature, it is correct to
keep the project simple by limiting it to easily manageable
key components, with emphasis on action, and giving other
institutional aspects only secondary consideration;
(b) To accelerate the arrival of key inputs such as trucks
which were crucial to the transport of relief materials,
the Borrower should avail itself of the Bank's sample
bidding documents and specifications when these are
relevant, and the Bank should provide technical assistance
to help the Government through the procurement process when
the implementing agency lacks this experience.



ETHIOPIA
DROUGHT RECOVERY PROGRAH
(Cr. 1576-ET)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.01     This sector dominates the economy by contributing nearly 502 of
GDP, which was US$5,246 million in 1987, about 90Z of total export
earnings and provides employment to 85Z of the population currently
estimated to be 4. million. In addition to generating food, exports and
employment, agriculture provides raw materials for the industrial Sector.
About 70Z of medium to large sized industries are agro based. Hence the
performance of the Ethiopian economy highly depends on the growth patter.
of agriculture. The peasant sector covers over 95Z of the cultivable
land and produces the same proportion of total agricultural production.
State farms and producer cooperatives play a marginal  roll.   The
livestock population, estimated to be over 70 million heads (the largest
in Africa) contributes greatly towards human nutrition. In most parts
of the country, livestock production is integrated with crop production.
Livestock, particularly cattle, are a major source of farm power and
energy. Traditionally draft animals are used in most crop production and
processing operations on the farm.  Also dried dung from livestock is
used as a source of energy for heating and cooking.
1.02     The agricultural sector, for many years after the revolution in
1974, has either remained stagnant or has grown marginally at the rate
of slightly over 12 annually. With a population growth rate of about 3Z
per annum, agricultural production has inadequately supported the
increased population. As a result, per capita agricultural production
has continued to decline from about $60 in 1975 to $50 in 1985.  This
contributed to increases in consumer food prices, malnutrition and
aggravated the effect of famine in drought years.  Some contributing
factors to the poor agricultural performance include:
(a)  inadequate production incentives for peasant farmers;
(b)  inadequate  generation and application of new farm
technologies;
(c) poor support services to farmers including input supply
credit, marketing and extension services; and
(d) lack of physical infrastructure.
1.03     The Government recognized the declining trend in food production
and decided to reverse and adopt a more pragmatic approach to
agricultural development; for example, by allowing private grain traders



- 2 -
to operate.    With  the new  approach,  the  international  community,
including the Bank started to provide the support needed to reverse the
declining trend in agricultural production.   For example  the Bank
recently approved a credit (PADEP I Cr. 1956-ET) for US$85.0 million in
support of improving efficiency of agricultural services, development of
new technology to peasant farmers and improvements in the incentive
framework for producers.
B. The Transport Sector
1.04     The Transport System covers approximately 43,200 km of roads,
two ports at Assab and Massawa, one railway line of 780 km linking Addis
Ababa and the port of Djibouti, four international airports at Addis
Ababa, Dire Dawa, Bahr Dar and Asn.ara and about 30 small airfields and
airstrips.
1.05     The road transport industry dominates the sector with mainly
private truckers owning about 70X of the trucking fleet.  As in many
developing countries, Ethiopia has a shortage of trucking capacity. The
shortage is more aggravated during the drought periods because of the
increased demand for transport for relief activities. As a result of the
increased demand for transport, priorities are re-ordered in an effort
to save lives at the expense of exports.   For example in 1984/85, a
shortage of transport was partly responsible for the decline in coffee
exports.
1.06     In addition to a poor road network in the country, the provision
of transport services is much more difficult and expensive because of
the rugged terrain and dispersed population. In the past 20 years, the
Bank group provided more than US$250 million to improve the main roads
and institutions in the transport sector.   In the process, more than
3000 km of rural roads were constructed between 1985 and 1986 and
associated institutions were strengthened.
C. Rural Water Supply Sector
1.07     This Sector is also weak.  It is estimated that less than 10?
of the rural population has access to potable water. For many years, the
Government's capacity to improve rural water supply has been hampered by
the scarcity of resources.  The small number of wells constructed and
prote-ted springs and ponds could not provide enough water during the
drought periods because of the Ligh demand created by both human and
livestock population.  However, in the last 5 years, with the help of
foreign donors, the Government increased its annual investment to the
sector by more than 50 from an equivalent of US$5 million to US$12
million. At the same time, the capacity of the Ethiopian Water Works
Construction Authority was increased through the provision of additional
drilling rigs and S,iaterials and training of its personnel.



- 3 -
D. The Drought Situation
1.08     In three consecutive years 1982-1984, severe drought conditions
prevailed throughout the country but more severely in the regions of
Wello, Tigrai and Eritrea in the north and parts of Sidamo region in the
south. By 1984, it was estimated between 6 and 10 million people were
affected by the drought. The prolonged drought and the exceptional pest
and disease outbreaks reduced food grain and root crop production. Draft
animals were weakened by the drought, causing inadequate land
preparation, weed control and crop processing after harvest.   It was
estimated that the drought of 1984 alone caused a decline in food
production of about 25-30 percent on the average annual production from
1981-83. The loss in livestock was equally severe (estimated to be 5OZ
of the population in the drought areas) because of scarcity of forage
and water.   At the height of the drought in 1984. additional relief
requirements were estimated to be equivalent to US$300-500 million.
Despite the overwhelming response by the international community,
including international agencies, bilateral donors, and non-government
organizations with relief support, it was estimated that more than US$110
million had been allocated in the 1984/85 budget to finance drought
relief related operations, equivalent to about 1OZ of the total revenue
for 1984/85.
II. PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Identification and kreparation
2.01     The Bank's response to the devastating drought situation in
Ethiopia was prompted by the presentation of GOE representatives at the
Bank-Fund Annual meeting of 1984.   Ethiopia's Minister for Finance
explained the seriousness of the drought and requested international
support to supplement the Government's effort to contain the situation.
In the discussion, the Government asked the Bank to re-orient its
activities to seek longer term solutions to recurring droughts, and
provide  assistance  for  small  scale  irrigation,   water   supply,
afforestation, highland rehabilitation and soil conservation.
2.02     As a follow up, the Bank mounted a mission to Ethiopia in
December 1984 to design and appraise a Drought Recovery Program in
consultation with the Government.
2.03     The drought recovery program was based on the overall Drought
Action Plan which was prepared by the National Committee for Central
Planning, more specific plans of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission
(RRC) and those of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).

B. Rationale and Program Objectives
2.04     Because of the severity of the drought, lives of millions of
people were in danger. The economy was disrupted and all development
activities virtually stopped in an effort to save lives.   The crisis
required a concerted effort by the international community to contain the
damages of the drought.   It was feared that if nothing was  done
immediately to assist the Government, the country's productive capacity
during the 1985 season would also be erased.
2.05     Following  the  experience  of  the  earlier  Drought  Areas
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 485-ET) after the 1973/74 drought, IDA's
intervention was limited to a restricted number of manageable components
by established institutions. The IDA credit was designed to provide fast
disbursing support necessary to:
(a) reduce the impact of the drought on the GOE public
investment program, particularly in the agricultural
sector;
(b) increase peasant crop production in high potential
areas through the provision of fertilizers, seed,
pesticides, oxen and other inputs in order to increase
the supply of food stocks;
(c) assist early recovery of productive capacity in the
devastated areas and/or in alternative areas where
refugees from drought stricken areas may be settled;
and
(d) increase the capacity of the Government to cope with
the drought situation and reduce the severity of its
impact on human welfare.
2.06     The drought Action Plan prepared by the Government included:
(a) equipment and agricultural inputs (seeds, pesticides,
oxen and tractors) estimated to cost about US$62
million  equivalent   to  regenerate  and  maintain
agricultural output;
(b) feed, veterinary drugs and medicines and other
facilities for livestock production estimated to cost
US$10 million equivalent; and
(c) small and medium scale irrigation works and ponds
costing about US$34 million.



C. Appraisal and Negotiations
2.07     The IDA mission that visited Ethiopia early December 1984
completed preparing the program and in two months a report was produced
and negotiated in Addis Ababa in two days, March 15 and 16, 1985. In
order to ensure efficient implementation, the Government's action plan
was modified to limit the scope of the program to a manageable size and
focus on a small number of drought relief, rehabilitation and/or control
components.
2.08     As a result the program consisted of four components:
(a) agricultural inputs;
(b) transport equipment;
(c) water supply facilities; and
(d) technical assistance.
D. Program Components
The main program components were:
2.09     Agricultural Inputs (US$22.6 million) included about 50,000 tons
of Diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizers and a one year supply of plant
protection chemicals and veterinary drugs and equipment. The fertilizer
was intended to supplement the existing stock of 21,000 tons.  Plant
protection chemicals and applicators were for the control of migratory
pests such as locusts, army worms and weaver birds.
2.10     Transport equipment (US$13.3 million)  included vehicles and
spare parts for RRC, and spare parts and tires for NATRACOR and private
truckers. These were intended to facilitate transportation of urgently
needed relief materials, particularly food, to drought areas without
interrupting other normal transportation needs.
2.11     Water Supply equipment (US$5.3 million) included 2 drilling
rigs, 170 pumps and engines, 90 generating units and about 800 hand
operated pump sets and other ancillary equipment.   The equipment was
intended for the rehabilitation of damaged water points and for
construction of additional facilities for water supply in the drought
affected areas.
2.12     Technical Assistance (US$0.2 million) included 12 man months of
Technical Assistance for the Technical Support Unit (TSU) of the Ministry
of Agriculture. TSU was responsible for coordinating disbursements and
preparing progress reports on implementation of the program.
2.13     The total Program cost estimated to be US$41.4 million, broken
down by component and its financing plan with a disbursement schedule is
presented in the following table:

originally planned.



III. PROGRAM IMPLEIENTATION
A. General
3.01     The program was successfully implemented (972 complete within
two years) and achieved set objectives, after it was extended for 9
months. The April 1987 Closing Date was not modified, but the account
was kept open until January 1988 to facilitate payments for vehicles for
RRC and for some water supply equipment.
B. Agricultural Inputs
3.02     A total of 47,753 tons of fertilizer was distributed to peasant
farmers in 12 regions during 1985 and 1986 cropping seasons. The largest
amount (39,976 tons or 84?) of fertilizer was distributed in the high
potential provinces of Shoa, Arsi and Gojjam. The fertilizer was used
for production of wheat, barley and maize. Also, about 295,600 liters
and 130,000 kilograms of pesticides and chemicals were distributed
nationwide during 1986 and 1987. The quantity of pesticide distributed
in an area depended on the spread of migratory pests. In addition to
fertilizers, pesticides and chemicals, some veterinary drugs and
equipment valued at about US$2.0 million equivalent were provided and
distributed throughout the country.  The quantity of veterinary drugs
issued to the regions was proportionate to the livestock population in
the area. Shoa region received the most (18Z) and Eritrea and Tigray
Regions received the least, 42 each.
C. Transport Equipment
3.03     A total of 100 four-wheel drive trucks of medium size (5-7 tons)
were procured for RRC and distributed to 7 regions. Out of this number,
87 were operating at the time of the PCR, and the remaining 13 were
damaged. Five of these vehicles were irreparable due to extensive damage
resulting from accidents. Nevertheless, these vehicles increased RRC's
hauling capacity for grain to areas of rugged terrain which were
inaccessible by ordinary trucks. Also spare parts and tires valued at
US$1.0 million were procured for RRC and distributed to its depots. In
addition, an equivalent of US$4.3 million of the credit was spent on
spare parts and tires for public and private truckers involved in drought
relief operations. About US$2.4 million equivalent of spare parts were
purchased by NATRACOR for its own trucks and an equivalent of US$1.9
million of spare parts and tires were sold to private truckers.  The
distribution of spare parts and tires was 552 to public institutions and
452 to private truckers, which was close to the original allocation
agreed at appraisal of 1:1.  This allocation ensured that the private
sector which owned about 702 of the trucking fleet was also served.

D. Water Supply
3.04     A variety of equipment and materials for water supply were
procured under the program.   Major items included submersible pumps,
surface centrifugal pumps, hand pumps, vertical shaft borehole pumps,
drilling rigs, well casings and screens and generating sets. A total of
US $ 4.6 million equivalent of the credit was spent on these items. Most
of the equipment and materials were distributed in the drought affected
provinces of Gondar, Gojjam, Wello, Eritrea and Tigray regions and a
small quantity was kept in Addis Ababa at a central strategic place for
future replenishments. A total of 22 boreholes and 20 shallow wells were
constructed and a water spring in Dedar province in Haraghe region was
fitted with a submersible pump.   These wells together are capable of
producing 100 liters of water per second.
E. Technical Assistance
3.05     The program provided technical assistance and office equipment
to the Ministry of Agriculture's Technical Support Unit which was
responsible for coordinating disbursements and reporting on progress of
program activities. In addition, the program financed a number of other
technical assistance contracts within the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Ethiopian Seed Corporation. These included contracts of varied duration
in  the  Agriculture  Development  Department,   Project  Formulation
Department, Irrigation Development Department, Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit, Finance Department and the Ethiopian Seed Corporation.   Out of
US$1.5 million spent on technical assistance, only about US$0.2 million
(less than 15Z) was directly used in support of the program. The rest
was used to address the long term aspects of drought through research on
improving seed quality.
F. Program Costs
3.06     There was a lack of information to show program costs financed
by the Government.  Appraisal cost estimates were US$41.4 million, of
which the IDA Credit amount was US $30.0 million, equivalent to SDR 31.3
million.   Actual disbursements  from the credit amounted to US$35.7
million, equivalent to SDR 31.0 million.   Actual project costs were

estimated to be in the vicinity of US$36.9 million. Credit amounts by
category, reallocations and actual disbursements are presented below:

'TOTAL            31,S00.0     31,800.0      31,043.6       99.2
Actual disbursements were 99.2? of the total credit. Disbursements for
trucks and spare parts and tires for RRC exceeded appraisal estimates by
more than 15? mainly due to the decline of the US dollar against the
Japanese yen.
3.07     Disbursements  for water  supply  equipment  and  spare  parts
increased by an equivalent of US$0.4 million. The cost overrun was about
102 of the original estimate of US$4.4 million.
3.08     As for technical assistance, disbursements increased by about
4502 from US$0.2 million estimated at appraisal to US$1.2 million. The
increase was caused by accommodating other technical assistance contracts
within the Ministry of Agriculture and the seed corporation addressing
long term aspects of drought.  Without these contracts, the estimated
amount of US$215,000 at appraisal would have adequately financed the
technical assistance and office equipment for the TSU in the Ministry
of Agriculture.
3.09     A financing arrangement whereby AIDB was expected to provide
credit to AISCO for procurement of agricultural inputs was not
implemented.   Neither did AIDB provide credit to Peasant Associations
and Cooperatives as originally envisaged.  As a result, peasants were
issued agricultural  inputs  including  fertilizers  free without   any
obligation to repay the Government because no arrangement for cost
recovery was made.



- 10 -
G. Procurement
3.10     International competitive bidding procedures were used in the
procurement of program materials which included most agricultural inputs,
vehicles and spare parts, and water supply equipment and spare parts.
The Bank also agreed to reimburse the Government for the expenditure on
about 25,000 tons of fertilizer which were already delivered in the
country, as a relief of the foreign exchange shortage the country was
facing. The procedures used in procuring the fertilizer were compatible
with those of IDA.
3.11     There was some delay in procuring vehicles for RRC caused by a
disagreement between GOE and the Bank on the results of the evaluation
of bids. The Government insisted on awarding the contract to the second
lowest evaluated bidder contrary to ICB procedures.   After prolonged
discussions, GOE finally agreed to award the contract to the lowest
evaluated bidder.
H. Accounts and Audits
3.12     Each of the implementing agencies was expected to maintain
separate accounts. In addition, AISCO and NATRACOR were expected to keep
records on procurement of agricultural inputs and spare parts and tires
and their distribution to beneficiaries.   It was agreed that these
accounts including statements of expenditure would be audited annually
and copies of the Audit reports submitted to IDA for review and comment.
3.13     This arrangement did not work satisfactorily because accounting
units of the implementing agencies were too weak to produce any accounts
with the exception of NATRACOR. NATRACOR's accounts were audited and a
copy of the audit report was sent to IDA.
3.14     Bank Supervision missions reminded implementing agencies of the
need for preparing accounts. But no proposals were made to strengthen
the accounting units of implementing agencies. However, in a follow-on
project, the Peasant Agricultural Development Project (PADEP-I, Cr. 1956-
ET), support is being given to AISCO to strengthen the Accounting Unit
and to update its accounts and audits.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01     The program was implemented by several agencies under the
overall coordination of the TSU of the Ministry of Agriculture. This
type of arrangement was designed to accommodate the multisectoral nature
of the program which included agriculture, transport and water resources.
Implementing agencies included the Agricultural Inputs Supply Corporation
(AISCO), Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Corporation (EPHARMECOR), National Road
Transport Corporation (NATRACOR), Ethiopian Water Works Construction



- 11 -
Authority (EWWCA) and the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC), and
financial support from the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank
(AIDB).
4.02     Responsibility for procurement of program materials was shared
by all agencies. Fertilizers were procured by AISCO, plant protection
chemicals and veterinary drugs and medicines by EPHARMECOR, water supply
equipment and spare parts by EWWCA, and vehicles, spare parts and tires
by NATRACOR. AIDB was responsible for providing credit to AISCO for
procurement of agricultural inputs and also credit to farmers through
their peasant associations and cooperatives fir these inputs.  However,
this aspect of the program was not implemented (para 3.09).
4.03     Overall, the program was implemented satisfactorily.  Most of
the materials procured under the program were distributed efficiently to
drougnt affected areas. New water supply facilities were constructed and
damaged ones rehabilitated. Vehicle spare parts and tires were sold to
both public and private truckers involved in drought relief operations.
Agricultural inputs including fertilizers, plant protection chemicals and
veterinary drugs and medicines were distributed to those areas that
suffered the most during the drought. Despite these achievements, most
implementing agencies failed to keep adequate records of GOE's
contribution to the drought program and did not prepare accounts (with
the exception of NATRACOR) for the materials they handled.
V. PROGRAM BENEFITS
5.01     Because  of  the  short  implementation  period  and  lack  of
preparation needed to set up a monitoring and evaluation system, there
was no mechanism for collecting data concerning project impact on food
production. However, the country's cereal production increased by about
72 in 1985 from the year before. Part of this increase can be attributed
to the improved rainfall in 1985 as well as the fertilizer input.  Also,
it is estimated over 100,000 people have been provided with potable water
from wells constructed and rehabilitated under the program. Some of the
water supply equipment is still being used for drilling new boreholes in
the program areas.
5.02     At the time of preparing the PCR, there was no information
available to show the quantity of relief supply that was transported by
trucks financed by the program, nor was there moritoring of the exclusive
use of the fleet for relief work. However, spare parts and tires were
procured and distributed at a time when the country was in great need of
these items.   The spare parts and tires were quickly absorbed in
restoring the trucking fleet which transported relief supplies to the
drought areas.

VI. BANK AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PERFORMANCE
A. Formulation and Appraisal
6.01     Faced with the urgent need to assist drought victims, the Bank
was able to respond rapidly with a program of quick disbursing components
which took less than 6 months from identification to effectiveness.
6.02     Lessons learnt from the previous Drought Areas Rehabilitation
Project Credit 485-ET were taken into account in the design of the new
project. The Drought Areas Rehabilitation Project experienced problems
of co-ordination of project activities because of its many components (9
all together) and was implemented over eight years instead of three years
as originally planned.   The subsequent drought recovery program was
limited to four components using simplified implementation ar-angements.
B. Program Supervision
6.03     During the two years of program implementation, 5 supervisions
were carried out by the Bank's Regional Office basically with one staff
member (procurement specialist).   These reviews noted the following
issues:
(a) Violation of Bank procurement procedures which caused
delays in the procurement of vehicles; and
(b) Deficiencies in record keeping and program accounts due
to weak accounting units of implementing agencies. As
a result, no accounts were prepared except those by
NATRACOR.
6.04     The Bank recognized the importance of the technical assistance
staff. When a request was made by the Government to include additional
technical assistance in the program to address long term issues related
to the drought, the Bank agreed to re-allocate funds from savings in
other components.
C. Performance of Technical Assistance
6.05     All technical assistance staff, who were either directly or
indirectly associated with the implementation of the Drought Recovery
Program, performed well within their terms of reference. In particular,
the staff of the TSU issued progress reports on time and carried out the
program coordination role diligently. The only drawback was that full-
time counterpart staff were not appointed to work with them, resulting
in little skills transfer.



- 13 -
VII. LESSONS LEARNED
7.01     The main lessons learned from the project are:
(a)  In emergency projects of this nature, it 's correct to keep
the project simple by limiting it to easily manageable key
components, with emphasis on action and giving other
institutional aspects only secondary consideration;
(b) To accelerate the arrival of key inputs such as trucks
which were crucial to the transport of relief materials,
the Borrower shouild avail itself of the Bank's sample
bidding documents and specifications where these are
relevant, and the Bank should provide technical assistance
under the loan or credit to help the Government through the
procurement process when the implementing agency lacks
this experience.
7.02     Other lessons might be:
(a) Full time direct counterpart staff should be appointed to
work with the technical assistance team to enable skills
transfer.  Technical assistance of a longer term nature
such as in agricultural research would be better placed in
a research project and not an emergency program; and
(b) Once the emergency program is operational, greater
attention should be given to administrative requirements
such as maintenance of records and accounts and
establishing a mechanism for monitoring and evaluation.
