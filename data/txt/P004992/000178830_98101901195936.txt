EGYPT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT TELECOMMUNICATION ORGANIZATION (ARETO)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The telecommunication facilities in Egypt are inadequate and
the quality of services poor. There is urgent need for rehabilitation
of existing equipment, removal of traffic bottlenecks and expansion to
cope with new demand arising out of increasing economic development
activities in the country. The Arab Republic of Egypt Telecommunication
Organization (ARETO) has prepared a program for calendar years 1975-77
to remedy the present deficiencies in the telecommunication services, to
meet partially the forecast telephone demand and to create a base for
sustained future development. The estimated cost of the program is
TE 121.10 million (US$310.00 million) with a foreign exchange content of
LE 50.78 million (US$130.00 million).
ii.       The three-year (1975-77) project identified for the first Bank
Group lending operation in the telecommunication sector in Egypt comprises
priority works selected from the program to provide, with ongoing works,
a balanced and viable development package. The project provides for
installation of 124,000 lines of local exchange equipment with associated
telephone cables and subscriber facilities, providing a net increase of
31% in the local network. In addition, 36,500 lines of worn-out auto-
matic and manual exchanges will be replaced by new automatic exchanges.
Three thousand four hundred and forty lines of telex exchange and 2,500
teleprinters will also be installed under the project.
iii.      The project is estimated to cost LE 67.73 million (US$173.ho
million) with a foreign exchange content of LE 30.23 million (US$77.ho
million). An IDA credit of US$30.00 million is proposed to cover part
of the foreign costs of the project. The balance foreign costs of
US$h7.40 million are covered by credits from Saudi Arabia Development
Fund and other sources. The borrower would be the Government of Arab
Republic of Egypt. The IDA credit will be on-lent to the Arab Republic
of Egypt Telecommunication Organization (ARETO), the Beneficiary, for a
term of 20 years including a grace period of 3 years, .at an interest
rate of 8 1/2% per annum.  The Government would also provide ARETO with
local funds required for the project.
iv.       The project is technically and financially sound, and economi-
cally justified. The project works and the ongoing works form a viable
and balanced package yielding full benefits immediately. Tlhe internal
economic return is estimated at 16%. It is increased to 18% if the



- ii -
foreign exchange component of capital expenditure is shadow-priced at a
value 50% above the estimated cost and the cost of labor is shadow-priced
at a value 25% below financial cost.
V.        All procurement under the credit would be subject to inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Groupts guide-
lines for such procurement.
vi.       With assurances indicated in Chapter 7, the project forms a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$30.00 mlillion equivalent on usual
terms, to be on-lent to the Arab Republic of Egypt Telecommunication
Organization (ARETO).



EGYPT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT TELECOMMUNICATION ORGANIZATION (ARETO)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMWUNICATION PROJECT
1. INTR3DUCTION
1.01      On behalf of the Arab Republic of Egypt Telecommunication
Organization (ARETO), the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has
requested IDA for assistance in financing the foreign exchange costs of
a program of telecommunication development in Egypt.
1.02      ARETO, which is responsible for all public telecommunication
services in Egypt, has drawn up a program for rehabilitation and expansion
of local, national long-distance and international telecommnmication facil-
ities for three calendar years 1975-77. The estimated cost of the program
is LE 121.10 million (US$310.00 million) with a foreign exchange content
LE 50.78 million (US$130.00 million).
1.03      The three-year (1975-77) project proposed for the first Bank
Group lending operation in the telecommunication sector in Egypt is part
Qf ARETOts program to improve the quality of service and to meet part of
the demand. The project provides for installation of 160,500 lines of
local exchange equipment (including 36,500 lines for replacement) with
associated cables and subscriber facilities, providing a net increase of
31% in local exchange network. Further, 3,440 lines will be added to
existing 480 lines of telex exchanges. The estimated cost of the project
is LE 67.73 million (US$173.40 million) with a foreign exchange content of
LE 30.23 million (US$77.40 million).
1.04      An IDA credit of US$30.00 million is proposed which will meet
about 38% of the foreign costs of the project. The balance foreign costs
of US$h7.40 million would be covered by credits from Saudi Arabia Develop-
ment Fund and other sources. The borrower would be the Government of
Arab Republic of Egypt which would on-lend the funds to ARETO, the bene-
ficiary. The Government would also provide ARETO the local funds required
for the project.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. D.F.D. Joshi and R. Smith
based on their findings during project identification and appraisal missions
to Egypt in July and September 1974 respectively, and on information fur-
nished by ARETO.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
Economy
2.01      The Arab Republic of Egypt has an area of 1,002,000 sq. kms.
Its population, estimated at 36.4 million in mid-1974, is increasing at
an annual rate of about 2.2%. The population is highly concentrated in
cultivated areas of the Nile Valley  and the Delta Region.  The urban
population constitutes about 45% of the total.  Egypt's per capita GNP
in 1972 was US$240.
2.02      Since 1973, the Government has taken a number of measures to
change the economic climate in Egypt. The consolidation of public sector
industries, liberalization of private sector, incentives to private foreign
investments, gradual diversion of resources from military to civilian uses,
proposed reopening of the Suez Canal and establishment of proposed free
trade zones would all give a fillip to commercial, industrial and govern-
mental activities with consequent heavy demands for telecommunication
services.
Telecommunication Sector
2.03      The Arab Republic of Egypt Telecommunication Organization (ARETO)
is responsible for operation, management and development of public tele-
communication facilities in Egypt, all of which are state-owned. The Suez
Canal Authority, defense services, railways and the civil aviation author-
ity maintain some telecommunication facilities for their own special needs.
2.04      ARETO is a Government Board under the Minister of Transport and
Communications. It is administered by a nine-member Board of Directors.
The Chairman of the Board (who is also its Chief Executive Officer) and one
other member of the Board are from ARETO's service cadre. The remaining
members of the Board are representatives of other Ministries of the Govern-
ment. ARETO is vested with adequate powers to make it independent of normal
administrative and financial regulations applicable to government departments.
The Chief Executive Officer has adequate authority for day-to-day admini-
stration and management, including procurement, civil construction except
for very large works, and staff recruitment other than engineers. ARETO's
organization is covered in paragraphs 5.01 and 5.02.
2.05      Some items of telecommunication equipment and cables are manu-
factured in Egypt. The state-owned Egyptian Telephone Company attached to
the Ministry of Industry produces crossbar telephone switching equipment
and telephone instruments under license from Messrs. L. M. Ericsson of
Sweden. Its predominant customer is ARETO which purchases all switching
equipment and most of the PBXs, PABX, and telephone instruments except for
small quantities sold directly to private customers. The state-owned
Electro Cable, Egypt,also attached to the Ministry of Industry, produces
wires and underground cables for electric power and telecommunication.



The factory's output of telephone cables is distributed between ARETO and
other users such as defense services. In general, production of the two
factories does not cover the full range of ARETO's needs and even where
local production exists, it is quantitatively inadequate. ARETO has
therefore to rely on import of a wide range of telecommunication equipment
and telephone cables including some types manufactured in the country.
Existing Telecommunication Facilities
2.06      The telephone density in Egypt is 1.32 per 100 population
(Annex 1). The equipped capacity of the local telephone system at the
end of 1973 was 373,500 lines. Of these 324,100 lines (86.7%) were auto-
matic; the balance 49,400 lines (13.3%) were manual. Automatic equipment
is installed in urban areas (Cairo; 25 exchanges, 201,600 lines;
Alexandria:  10 exchanges, 64,200 lines; other towns:  24 exchanges,
58,300 lines) whereas manual equipment is installed in 1,679 exchanges in
non-urban areas.
2.07      One hundred forty-two thousand lines of automatic equipment are
of the old rotary type installed before 1960. Of these, 60,000 lines are
very old and worn-out. These cause considerable call failures and hence
need early replacement. The balance 231,500 lines of automatic exchange
equipment are of Ericssonts crossbar type which is now standard for Egypt.
2.08      Major cities in Lower Egypt are connected by high-capacity
coaxial cable and microwave systems. A coaxial cable is under installation
from Cairo to Aswan in Upper Egypt. In the rest of the country, long-
distance service is provided over open-wire lines and carrier systems.
Seven trunk automatic exchanges provide subscriber trunk dialling (STD)
service between seven towns in the Delta region. Telex service is available
only at Cairo and Alexandria. International telephone and telex services
are operated manually over circuits provided mainly through undersea cables
to Italy and Lebanon.
2.09      Important features of telecommunication facilities in Egypt
existing on January 1, 1974 are listed in Annex 2.
Service Quality
2.10      Because of lack of adequate investment over many years, the present
telecommunication facilities in Egypt are inadequate in all respects and are
overloaded even with the present traffic. Some of the existing facilities
are also worn-out or defective because of their age. The telecommunication
facilities in the Suez Canal Zone were extensively damaged during the war.
Consequently, the quality of all telecommunication services - local, long-
distance and international - is poor.
2.11      Local telephone service is poor because of overloads resulting
from lack of adequate expansion in the past and continued use of old worn-
out equipment and cables. Inability to meet demands due to inadequate



-h -
expansion in the past causes heavy use of available lines resulting in
traffic overloads and congestion. This overload is further increased by
repeat calls arising out of large number of call failures on old worn-out
exchange equipment which constitute about 16% of the total installed
capacity. Faults on defective umderground cables cause outages of sub-
scribers lines and inter-exchange circuits.  Reduction in availability of
inter-exchange circuits, alreadyr inadequate, causes further traffic con-
gestion.
2.12      The quality of long-distance services is affected primarily by
inadequate switching equipment. The STD service is congested because of
inadequacy of trunk automatic exchange equipment. Similarly, manual trunk
service is affected by shortage of operating positions. The international
service is also seriously delayed due to shortage of operating positions.
2.13      The poor quality of existing local and long-distance telecom-
munications services, the current inadequacy of telephone connections and
ARETO s inability to provide new connections hamper business activities of
both existing and new concerns, as well as that of government administration.
To overcome the present shortcomings, ARETO's expansion program is designed
to improve the quality of service and, within the constraints of available
resources, meet partially the demand for new connections.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THIs PROJECT
The Program
3.01      ARETO's program for calendar years 19b- to 1977 provides for
phased replacement of old worn-out local exchange equipment and defective
cables, and expansion of local, national long-distance and international
telecommunication facilities in Egypt. The program comprises the follow-
ing components:
(a)  Ongoing works, that is works under execution in 1974
spilling over into the 1975-77 period (para. 3.04);
(b)  Works under the project (paras. 3.05 & 3.07);
(c)  Other new works (para. 3.06); and
(d)  Preparatory works for the post-1977 program.
While all components of the program are required for meeting demands and
improving the quality of service, works included in the project represent
the highest priority items of the program to help eliminate the traffic
bottlenecks, meet partially the demand and pave the way ior sustained
future development. The telecommunication facilities to be added under
the program are given in Annex 3.
3.02      The total estimated cost of the program is LE 121.10 million
(US$310.00 million) with a foreign exchange content of LE 50.78 million
(US$130.00 million). Annex 4 gives details of the program and project
costs. Annex 5 gives details of sources financing the foreign cost
of different items under the program and the project.
3.03      Finance is secured for the ongoing works and arranged, subject
to confirmation, for the project. Foreign exchange ixinancing for other
components of the program is to be provided by a credit from Saudi Arabia
Development Fund and a supplier's credit from L.M. Ericssons of Sweden
(Annex 5). Any delays in execution of works other than the ongoing and
the project works will not affect the viability of the project.
Ongoing Works
3.04      The major items of ongoing works are the Cairo-Alexandria-
Tripoli (Lybia) microwave system under installation, the Cairo-Aswan
coaxial cable system of which 350 kms out of 850 kms are already commis-
sioned, and expansion of Cairo trunk automatic exchange by 1,800 lines for
which equipment is available. The ongoing works together wiLh the project
works (para. 3.07) form a viable, composite and balanced package, independent
of other components of the program.



-6-
The Project
3.05      The works under the project, their costs, items for IDA financing,
and other particulars are covered in paragraphs 3.07 onwards.
Other New Works
3.06      New works other than the project works (para. 3.07) are listed at
Annex 3, Column 3. Amongst these, priority items are the installation of
an earth 8tation for satellite commmnication and the international telephone
and telex exchanges.
Project Works
3.07      The three-year (1975-77) project proposed for IDA financing
comprises the following works:
(a)  installation of 124,000 lines of local exchange equipment
together with subscriber and inter-exchange telephone
cables for connection of 108,000 direct exchange lines
(DELs);
(b)  replacement of (i) 14,000 lines of old worn-out automatic
exchange equipment, (ii) 22,500 lines of manual exchange
equipment in rural areas by automatic exchangeg and (iii)
defective telephone cables;
(c)  installation of 160,000 telephone instruments and other
subscribers facilities including Private Manual and Auto-
matic Branch Exchanges (PBXs and PABXs);
(d)  installation of eight new telex exchanges of 160 lines
each and expansion of twlo existing telex exchanges by
2,160 lines; and
(e)  installation of 2,500 teleprinters.
Further details of the project are given in Annex 3, Column 2.
Project Costs
3.08      The project is estimated to cost LE 67.73 million (US$173.40 million)
with a foreign exchange content of LE 30.23 million (US$77.40 million). The
costs of different items under the project are indicated in the schedule
below.  The anticipated annual expenditures on different items during the
project period are set out in Annex 4.

3.09      Equipment costs are based on prices charged by the local factory
to ARETO and on prices encountered in recent international tenders for
similar items under IBRD/IDA-financed projects in other countries. Cable
costs assume that all cables for the project will be imported and that the
small quantity of cables likely to be available from the domestic factory
will be used for other parts of the program. Local costs include instal-
lation costs which are based on ARETO's experience.
Contingencies
3.10      Telecommunication development is a continuous process that occurs
through new installations or plant expansion at hundreds of locations in any
year. Because of this, additional requirements of equipment and cables at
some points due to changes in demand are generally compensated by reductions
at others. The local exchange expansion which constitutes a major part of
the project is also limited by the output of the local equipment factory.
The total program is also limited by the capacity of ARETO staff to execute
the works during the project period. In view of these factors, the possi-
bility of any large physical overrun is small. The total physical
contingency provision has therefore been limited to about 5% of the project
works amounting to LE 2.83 million (US$7.24 million) with a foreign exchange
content of LE 1.28 million (US$3.27 million).
3.11      In telecommunication contracts, it is usual to have firm prices
through the period of delivery. To cover possible price increases up to
the date of contract for overseas purchases, a price contingency of LE 3.51
million (US$9.01 million), equivalent to approximately 13.8% of the foreign
costs of the project has been allowed. This contingency provision is based
on review of price trends of telecommunication equipment and of important
commodities like copper and lead. To cover likely increase in local costs
due to increases in wages, and costs of domestic purchases and civil works,



-8-
a price contingency of LE 4.43 million (US$11.33 million) has been provided,
equivalent to approximately 14.O% of the local costs of the project.
Items for IDA Financing
3.12      The allocation of the proposed IDA credit of US$30.00 million is
given below:

TOTAL                               30.00
3.13      Of the remaining foreign costs of US$47.ho million for the project,
US$36.50 million have been arranged, subject to confinmation, as follows:
(a) credit from Saudi Arabia Development Fund: US$13.40 million; (b) bi-
lateral credit from France: Us$h.00 million; (c) supplierts credit from
L.M. Ericsson of Sweden: US$19.10 million. The Government has undertaken
during negotiations to provide the balance US$10.90 million required by the
Egyptian Telephone Company for procurement of raw materials and components
for manufacture of equipment required under the project (para. 3.18),
Details of items to be financed under the different credits are given in
Annex 5.
Procurement
3.14      All equipment and cables to be financed under the proposed IDA
credit, namely telephone cables with associated gas pressurization equipment
and telex exchange equipment, will be procured through international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group's guidelines applicable to
such procurement.
3.15      Local exchange equipment and associated PBXs, PABXs and telephone
instruments required for the project finances, outside of IDA financing will
be procured as follows: (a) 100,000 lines from local factory (para. 3..18);
(b) 22,500 lines from France under bilateral credit; (c) 20,000 lines under
supplier's credit from L.M. Ericsson of Sweden whose cross-bar equipment
is standard in Egypt and (d) 18,300 lines under Saudi Arabia Development
Fund credit.
3.16      Six hundred forty lines of telex exchange equ.ipment required for
extension of existing telex exchanges will be procured from L.M. Ericsson



-9-
of Sweden under their credit. Other telex exchange equipment, PCM4 equip-
ment and teleprinters will be procured under Saudi Arabia Development Fund
credit.
3.17      Procurement under the French bilateral credit will be in line with
the conditions of that credit. Procurement under Saudi Arabian credit will
be through international competitive bidding.
Domestic Equipment Production
3.18      ARETOts expansion program for local telephone network is largely
dependent on the output of the local equipment factory for supply of local
exchange equipment, telephone instruments, PBXs, and PABXs. The present
capacity of the factory is not adequate to meet the anticipated supplies
to ARETO for the project. The factory needs additional machinery, tools
and testing equipment for increasing its production capacity to the required
level, and additional raw materials and components for the manufacture of
equipment to be supplied for the project. The Government has during negoti-
ations undertaken to provide the factory with the necessary foreign exchange
for purchase of machinery, tools, raw materials and components to increase
production to level required to meet the project targets.
Project Execution
3.19      ARETO staff have the capability for planning, detailed engineering
and execution of all works under the project. ARETO staff would also install
all telephone and telex exchange equipment, PBXs, PABXs and PCM equipment,
and undertake all works relating to telephone cables (e.g. laying, jointing
and gas pressurization). The project service targets given are at Annex 6.
Disbursements
3.20      The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the CIF costs
of imported equipment and cables proposed for IDA financing.
3.21      The schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements is at Annex 7.
As the present project will be the beginning of a continuing development
program for the telecommunications sector, it is proposed that any unused
balances should be applied, after consultation with IDA and under same terms
and conditions, against foreign costs of goods similar to those financed.
under the IDA credit.

4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
General
4.01      The basic aim of ARETO's program for 1975-77 (which incorporates
the IDA-financed project) is to provide infrastructure support to Fgypt's
national development through efficient telecommunication services. The
program is well-balanced, and is based on correct priorities in the sector.
However, it is modest in scope and does not meet the anticipated demand
because of constraints of available finance, local production capacity of
switching equipment and ARETOts present physical capacity for execution.
The program is, however, designed to improve the quality of service which
is now poor (paras. 2.10 to 2.13), meet partially the demand for new con-
nections (paras. 4.03 and 4.04) and provide a base of sustained future
development of telecommnication facilities in Egypt.
4.02      The works comprising the project are priority items selected from
the program to provide, with the ongoing works, a balanced, composite and
viable development package independent of other new works.
Local Telephone Network
4.03      The current waiting list is over 166,700 (about 47% of the working
lines); many applicants for new connections have been waiting for many years.
These clearly point to the inadequacy of the local telephone service in
Egypt. The average rate of growth of DELs has been only 5.5% annually over
the last decade, being limited by the lack of capacity in the system. The
total demand (DELs plus waiting list), has, however, been increasingat an mnml
rate of 11.5% over the last five years for which data is available (Annex 9).
The real demand is higher because the registered waiting list does not
reflect the latent demand from potential subscribers who are discouraged
from applying by the delay of several years in getting connection. With a
faster rate of release of new connections in future, consequent increase in
public confidence in the service, and because of the general increase in
economic  development activities in Egypt, the future rate of growth of
demand is likely to be higher.
4.04      As of January 1, 1975, ARETO had about 355,500 direct exchange
lines and about 166,700 waiting applicants, giving a total demand of
522,200.  Even at the conservative historical growth rate of only 11.5%
per annum, the demand will be 724,000 by end of 1977. The project provides
for installation of only 108,000 new lines during this period. Consequently,
the unsatisfied demand or the number of waiting applicants for new con-
nections will increase to 260,500 by end of 1977.
4.05      The project also provides for replacement of 14,000 lines of
worn-out automatic local exchange equipment (constituting 23% of total worn-
out automatic equipment). Further, 22,500 lines in 93 manual exchanges in
rural areas will be replaced by automatic equipment to provide better service
from these exchanges. Some defective telephone cables will also be replaced.
These replacements will reduce service failures on such equipment and cables,
and consequently improve service quality.



Telex Exchanges and Teleprinters
4.o6      The existing telex network in Egypt is negligible, comprising
two small exchanges at Cairo and Alexandria of 320 and 160 lines respectively.
The pending waiting list for telex connections in these two cities and in
other major towns where no telex facilities exist today is over 2,000 and
new applications are being received at an increasing rate. The total demand
is expected to be about 5,000 by end of 1977. The project provides for
expansion of existing two telex exchanges by 2,160 lines and installation
of 1,280 lines in eight new telex exchanges (Annex 3, Column 2). Thus,
total telex installation will be 3,440 lines during the project period which
will enable about 2,800 new telex connections to be given. The unsatisfied
telex demand at and of 1977 is likely to be over 2,000.
4.07      The project provides for import of 2,500 teleprinters to meet the
requirements of the public telegraph service and to meet telex subscriber
requests for teleprinters from ARETO; other subscribers ask for their own
teleprinters.
Least Cost Solution
4.08      ARETO's program is based on long-term fundamental plans prepared
some years ago. These plans, based on sound engineering designs and accepted
practices in telecommunication, provide a satisfactory framework for future
development of telecommunication services in Egypt.
4.09      The local telephone and telex network designs and plant follow
accepted practices to minimize costs. Continued use of locally manufactured
telephone switching equipment for major part of the local exchange expansion
program is justified by the need for standardization, savings in foreign
exchange, lead time in supplies and employment potential. Import of balance
local telephone equipment is needed to meet immediate needs until the local
factory can increase its production level to meet full requirements of ARET0.
Considerations of standardization and ease of technical management also
necessitates part of this imported equipment particularly in the large metro-
politan networks of Cairo and Alexandria to be from the manufacturer whose
design is standard in Egypt.
4.10      Within the above overall framework, the dimensioning and timing
of the works under the program and the project are based on individual
engineering studies by ARETO for improving service to.existing subscribers
and meeting new demands at the lowest cost.
Rate of Return
4.11      The internal economic return on the project, defined as the dis-
coumt rate which equalizes the stream of expected incremental revenues
attributable to the project with the incremental capital and operating
costs excluding taxes, is 16% (Annex 10). A sensitivity analysis shows
that, even under an unfavorable combination of main parameters - 10% decrease
in revenues and 20% increase in capital costs - the rate of return would not



- 12 -
be less than 11%. Shadow pricing of the foreign exchange component at a
value approximately the parallel market rate and shadow pricing the labor
component at a value 25% below financial cost would result in a rate of
return of 18%.
4.12      This use of incremental revenues as a measure of benefits results
in a rate of return which may be regarded as a minimum calculation, as
people generally value service at an amount greater than the price they
pay to obtain it, and addition of new subscribers also increases the benefits
to existing connected subscribers.

5. THE BENEFICIARY - ARETO
Organization and Management
5.01      ARErO's position within the governmental set-up, and its powers
and responsibilities are outlined in paragraphs 2.03 and 2.04. Its internal
organizational structure (Annex 11) follows the pattern of a number of
other telecommunication administrations and is satisfactory.
5.02      The top and middle management levels are staffed by competent
experienced officers most of whom have received training abroad in their
respective specialized fields. At present, the two intermediate positions
of Deputy Chairman, Operations, and Deputy Chairman, Technical Affairs,
(Annex 11) are vacant; hence, ten officers now report directly to the
Chairman. The need for staffing these two intermediate positions of Deputy
Chairman has not yet become critical and work is continuing satisfactorily.
However, in the long run, particularly when ARETO begins to expand its
facilities, it is important that the posts be filled. The need for filling
these posts has been brought to the notice of the Government. The two posts
are expected to be filled and become operational during 1976.
Planning
5.03      The planning and development work in ARETO is at present divided
between several units - switching, local and long-distance cables, radio,
international, etc. Individually, these units are staffed by qualified
engineers with adequate technical capabilities who follow well-established
principles and normal engineering practices in evolution of development
plans in their respective fields. However, there is need for coordination
between the different units in finding least-cost solutions, in determining
relative priorities for various works and in the timing of their execution.
Also, the basic cQsts adopted in the costings of works need to be kept cur-
rent to reflect the latest prices of telecommunication equipment and cables,
and labor costs. The present arrangements result in higher costs and
unbalanced development with consequent inefficient utilization of some assets
and overloading of others.
5.04      Telecommunication development is capital intensive.  To ensure
adequate return on heavy investments through full utilization of the costly
assets, it is necessary to:
(a) formulate long-term plans for development of different
telecommunication services;
(b) organize systematic collection and analysis of information
on traffic, waiting list, costs of eauipment, cables and
labor, and other data required for accurate forecast and
efficient management of demand and realistic costing of
works;



(c) coordinate detailed planning and establish priorities
in development of different services;
(d) consider various alternatives of meeting requirements and
decide on the least-cost solution; and
(e) forecast requirements of physical and financial resources,
and allot them to different services on basis of annual
plans.
5.05      In order to formulate optimum development plans within the available
resources based on a systematic collection of data, analysis of needs, estab-
lishment of priorities and consideration of alternatives, ARETO will need to
strengthen its planning unit and organize its functioning so as to perform
these tasks effectively on a conitinuous basis. This was discussed and
agreed during negotiations.
Staffing
5.06      ARETO employs a staff of approximately 41,000.  Annex 12 gives
category distribution of staff now and as anticipated at the end of the
project period. The staff complement will increase 33% against 40% increase
in telecommunication facilities during the project period; staff level will
correspondingly reduce from 8.67 to 8.23 per 100 telephones. Any sub-
stantial reduction is constrained by the staff requirements of manually
operated services, the increase in number of installations which are part
of the development works under the program, and Government's policy of maxi-
mizing employment.
Training
5.07      There is a central Technical Training and Research Institute
(TTRI) in Cairo and six other training centers in the regions. The TTRI is
assisted by six ITU experts under UNDP Technical Assistance Program with
Egyptian counterparts who will take over their duties on completion of UNDP
project. The TTRI trains engineers, technicians and skilled workmen whereas
the regional centers train telephone, telegraph and wireless operators and
junior administrative staff. The TTRI also conducts refresher (in-service)
training courses. The present training capacities of the TTRI (1,200
trainees per annum) and of the six regional training centers (1,300 trainees
per annum) are adequate for the current needs.  The composition of the
training courses is also satisfactory. TTRI is under expansion to increase
its training capacity from 1,200 to 1,500 trainees per annum and number of
trainee-courses from 2,000 to L,000 per annum. Regional training centers
are being similarly expanded. With these expansions, the training facili-
ties will be adequate to meet staff training requirements for the project.
Accounts and Audit
5.08      ARETO's accounting system is on an accrual basis and is generally
satisfactory. While the accounting staff is adequately qualified and



- 15 -
competent, senior staff would benefit from exposure to accounting and
financial management methods used by telecommunication organizations in
other countries. During negotiations ARET0 agreed to develop and implement
such a training program for its senior accounting staff.
5.09      Accounting records are satisfactory except for plant records
which are now maintained by both the engineering and accounting departments
without proper reconciliation. ARETO is currently working on such a recon-
ciliation. Combined with this, the assets are being revalued, and on
completion of this work, all plant records will be adjusted to record the
new agreed values and will thereafter be maintained on a continuing basis.
ARETO agreed during negotiations to complete the asset revaluation by
December 1976, and to incorporate the results in its accounts.
5.10      Billing and collection procedures are satisfactory.  Accounts
receivable include approximately LE 5 million arrears due from Government.
This sum has accumulated since 1957 when ARETO was first incorporated, and
has arisen through differences between amounts billed by ARETO and lesser
amounts approved for telephone service in the budgets of the various govern-
ment departments. While budgeting by government departments is now on a
more realistic basis, and their current telephone bills paid, the problem
of the old accumulated arrears has not been resolved despite discussions
between the Government and ARETO. During negotiations, the Government and
ARETO agreed to identify all the outstanding amounts as at December 31,
1974, to resolve the problem of disputed arrears by June 30, 1976, and to
settle the agreed outstanding balances not later than December 31, 1977.
Except for these old arrears, the balance of accounts receivable is reason-
able.
5.11      Accounting procedures include provision for both pre- and post-
audit. The pre-audit is carried out by ARETO staff and the post-audit, on
a continuing basis, by government auditors. During negotiations, ARETO
agreed to provide audited financial statements to IDA within six months after
the end of each financial year.
Tariffs
5.12      A summary of the current telecommunications tariff is given in
Annex 12. The tariffs, which require government approval, were last increased
in 1966 at which time the principal rates were increased by 50%. The tariff
at current levels is projected to produce a good rate of return until about
1978, and will generate 18% of the funds required for the expansion program,
which is satisfactory in view of the rapid acceleration of the investment in
the program period.
5.13      The tariff structure is generally satisfactory.  However, the
tariffs for long-distance services are proportionately low for the short
distance slabs compared to those for the long-distance slabs, which is the
reverse of the pattern of costs of providing such services. Also, the long-
distance tariffs are at present the same for the manually operated as for



- 16 -
the automatic STD service, whereas, in most countries, the tariffs for
manually operated trunk calls are maintained at a higher level than for
STD calls in order to encourage usage of STD service, which is less expensive
and more efficient.
5.14      Although tariff levels and structure are generally satisfactory,
the revenue per exchange line is low. This is, in part, due to the relatively
large number of free calls included in the rental, particularly for residen-
tial subscribers. ARETO also uses a number of practices which tend to reduce
trunk revenues per line, such as barring almost all residential telephones
from use of STD service and a requirement that an additional deposit be paid
before operator-serviced trunk calls can be placed from residential tele-
phones.
5.15      During negotiations, ARETO agreed to make an analysis of its
revenues, to review its tariff structure and consider removal of present
restrictions on subscribers making long-distance calls on basis of agreed
guidelines. ARETO would employ a consultant, if necessary, to assist its
staff in this review.

6. FINANCES
Background
6.01      ARETO retains its revenues on a day-to-day basis but pays its
net income-to Government annually. All past financing has been from
government sources except for small amounts of financing which have been
obtained from bilateral sources and supplier's credit. Government invest-
ment is represented by equity and loans which bear interest at 4 1/2% and
are amortized over a 14 year period. In order to achieve a greater degree
of financial responsibility for ARETO, it was recommended that it be allowed
to retain its net income, that interest rates be increased to a commercial
level and dividends paid on equity. It was agreed that these organizational
changes would be reviewed as part of a general over-view Gf government
financing of all public sector organizations.
Present Financial Position
6.02      ARETO's balance sheets are given in Annex 14.  ARETO's finarnial
position as at December 31, 1973 is summarized below:
Million

TOTAL CAPITAL AND LIABILITIES       81.0  207.3
6.03      The gross value of plant in service has been based upon antici-
pated results of the revaluation of assets now in progress (see para.
5.09). ARETO agreed during negotiations to complete this revaluation not
later than December 31, 1976 and to incorporate the results in its accounts.
As at December 31, 1970, accumulated depreciation is estimated at 40% of
the value of gross plant in service at that date. Thereafter, depreciation



- 18 -
has been calculated at the rate of 5% per annum on the value of gross assets
at the end of the preceding year. This is in line with experience in other
countries. ARETO presently uses a schedule of depreciation rates which
produces a composite rate of approximately 4% per annum. This will be
reviewed following completion of the asset revaluation. The value of total
fixed assets in 1977 is projected to be almost two and one half times the
1973 figure. Hence the relative significance of any errors in the past
va'bes of gross assets diminishes substantially as the accelerated develop-
ment program gets under way.

6.05      The above fina&cing plan covers the requirements of ARETO for
carrying out the entire 1975-77 program. The foreign costs of the ongoing
works and the project works, which form a viable development package, total
US$107.9 million. Financing for the ongoing portion, US$30.5 million, has
been obtained. The balance, US$77.l+ million, is to be provided, US$30
million from relending of the proposed IDA credit US$13.4 million from the
proposed loan of US$28 million from the Saudi Arabia Development Fund,



- 19 -
bilateral credits of US$19.1 million from Sweden and US$4 million from
France, and a contribution of US$10.9 million by the Egyptian Government
to cover the imported components of the items to be procured from the
local equipment factory. Conclusion of the arrangements for provision of
US$36.5 million (Saudi Arabia US$13.4 million, Sweden US$19.1 million and
France US$4.o million) is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit. The proposed IDA credit of US$30 million is to be re-lent to
ARETO, repayable over 20 years including 3 years grace, with interest at
8 1/2% per annum. The local currency costs in excess of ARETOts own
earnings will be provided as loans by the Government, repayable over 14
years and bearing interest at 4 1/2% per annum. The additional foreign
exchange for the balance of the program is expected to be covered by the
balance of the l6an from the Saudi Arabia Development Fund and credits from
Sweden. Details of foreign exchange requirements for the project and
program are in Annex 5.
Future Finances
6.o6      Forecast income statements for years ending December 31, 1.979
are given in Annex 16. A summary of the results for years 1973 to 1979
is given below:
Million LE
1973  1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979
Revenue                25.2  28.3  31.8  35.1  40.5  45.3  50.8
Operating Income        5.7   5.9   7.4   8.9  11.5  12.6  13.5
Rate of Return on Net
Plant in Service     12.4% 11.5% 12.6% 13.8% 13.8% 11.0%  9.1%
6.07      Revenues and expenditures have been generally projected to increase
in proportion to growth in the number of subscribers, with some further
additional revenue increase projected for improvement in earnings per line.
6.08      A rate of return on net assets of not less than 11% is considered
to be a reasonable minimum level which would provide funds for capital
servicing and for self-financing of a reasonable proportion of future con-
struction requirements. Agreement to maintain tariffs at a level which will
achieve this rate of return was reached during negotiations.
6.09      On the basis of present forecasts, the projected rates of return
are between 12.6% and 13.8% over the project years 1975-77. From 1978
onwards, somewhat lower rates are forecast and tariff increases may be nec-
essary at this time. To achieve the 11% rate of return, revenue increase
of approximately 5% may be required in 1979. However, there is a reasonable
expectation that implementation of changes in the tariff structure and the
removal of barriers to long-distance use following the review referred to in
paragraph 5.15, may increase the revenues per line to an extent which may
eliminate the need for tariff increases.
6.10      Indicators whiich will help monitor ARETO's performance are given
in Annex 18.

Fiscal Impact
6.11      Over the period 1975-77, the Government is projected to invest
some EE 40 million in ARETO. Of this projected outflow, approximately
SE 18 million represents taxes, leaving a net outflow of FE 22 million.
This outflow is brought about by the rapid acceleration of investment after
a period of relative stagnation., A combination of earnings from this invest-
ment and a levelling-off of future investment will create a future cash
inflow situation.

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal issues:
(a) The Government will provide the Egyptian Telephone Company
with the foreign exchange needed for increasing its pro-
duction capacity to meet the requirements of the project
(para. 3.18);
(b) ARETO will strengthen its planning unit to enable it to
function effectively in formulating expansion plans based
on a systematic analysis of the needs (para. 5.05);
(c)  AREhT  will initiate proposals for development of its
senior accounting staff (para. 5.08);
(d) ARETO will incorporate results of revaluation of assets
in its accounts by December 1976 and maintain adequate
plant records thereafter (para. 5.09);
(e) ARETO will resolve with the Government the problem of
accumulated arrears of telephone revenues from government
departments (para. 5.10);
(f) ARETO will provide the Association with audited financial
statements within six months after the end of each finan-
cial year (para. 5.11);
(g) ARETO will analyze, on basis of agreed guidelines, the
present low revenue per line, review the telecommunication
tariff structure and consider removal of present restric-
tions on subscribers making long-distance calls (para.
5.15);
(h) The Government will consider revision of financial arrange-
ments for public sector undertakings (para. 6.01);
(i) The Government will confirm arrangements for foreign
borrowings and provide necessary local funds for the ongoing
and project works (para. 6.05); and
(j) The Government and ARETO will undertake to maintain tariffs
at a level sufficient to achieve a minimum annual rate of
return of 11% on average net assets (para. 6.08).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the Credit is confirmation that
financing should have been obtained in an amount equivalent to US$36.5 million,
to meet the foreign exchange cost of the project (para. 6.05).



- 22 -
7.03      With the above agreem,ents, the project is suitable for an ILA
credit of US$30 million equivalent on the usual terms, to be on-lent to
the Arab Republic of Egvypt Telecommunication Organization (AREm).

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Projections
A. Income Statements
1. Revenues per direct exchange line are expected to increase
annually, reflecting an increase in economic activity and
improvement in service.
2. Operating expenses, other than depreciation, are projected at
a rate equal to the system growth rate. Improved productivity
is expected to offset inflationary factors.
3. Depreciation has been calculated  at the rate of 5% on the gross
value of plant in service at the beginning of each year. This
is in line with experience in other countries. ARETO presently
uses a variety of depreciation rates which produce a composite
rate of approximately 4% per annum.
B. Balance Sheets
k. Plant in Service.  The gross value of plant in service is based
upon anticipated results of a revaluation now in progress and
which is to be completed by December 31, 1976 and the results
incorporated in the accounts. Accumulated depreciation in 1970
has been assumed at 40% of this value.
-5. Plant under construction is projected in an amount equal to con-
struction expenditures for the current and preceding years.
6. Accounts Receivable - Telecommunications. The amounts shown as
receivable include approximately BE 5 million for arrears due
from Government. This is an accumulation of old balances and
current charges are paid reasonably promptly. It was agreed
during negotiations that ARETO and Government would resolve
this item but pending a decision the balance has been retained
in the projected figures. The amount of current receivables
(approximately BE 4 million in 1973) is reasonable and has been
increased slightly in the projections to allow for system growth.
7. Accounts Receivable - Other. The principal item under this
heading is advance payments to suppliers, chiefly progress pay-
ments to the local factories.



ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 2 pages
8. Cash. This has been projected at a constant figure of BE 3
million. In view of the need for the substantial provision
of funds from Government, the amount of cash in hand is of
E                  less significance than is normally the case.
9. Government of Egypt. All funds provided in 1975 and thereafter
have been considered as debt, repayable over 14 years and carrying
interest at 4h4 per annum. This is in accordance with present
practice.
10. Loans from foreign suppliers and credits from bilateral sources
are calculated in accordance with arrangements with these indi-
vidual suppliers or countries. Principal lenders are the Govern-
ments of Italy, Sweden (Ericsson) France, and Japan, and Society
Sudtel of Lebanon.
11. IDA credit of US$30 million. This is assumed to be re-lent for
a 20 year term including a grace period of 3 years, with interest
at the rateof 894 per annum.
12. The Government of Lybia is financing the construction of the
microwave link between Egypt and Lybia.
13. The sum of SE 10.9 million (US$28 million) is ,expected to be
financed from the Saudi Arabia Development Fund. For projection
purposes it has been assumed that this sum will be repayable over
a 17 year period, including 2 years grace, with interest at the
rate of 4% per annum.
14.  Current liabilities include withheld taxes, creditors for goods
and services and checks not presented. This latter item is phased
out in the projections, accounting for the reducing balance.
