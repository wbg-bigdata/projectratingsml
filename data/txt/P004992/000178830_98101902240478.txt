INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT FOR A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of US$30 million on standard IDA
terms to the Arab Republic of Egypt, to hlelp finance a Telecommunications
project in association witlh other co-lenlers, as described in paragraplhs
41 arid 45 Ielow. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Arab
Republic of Egypt Telecommunications Organization (ARETO) for a term of 20
years, including 3 years of grace, at an effective cost of 8.5 percent per
annum. ARETO would also bear the foreign exchange risk on the subsidiary
loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An Economic report, "The Egyptian Economy in 1974:    Its Position
and Prospects," dated September 25, 1974 has been distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        The background to, and recent developments in, Egypt's economy have
been elaborated in the economic report. The following paragraphs contain a
summary of the prospects for the future and the position with respect to ex-
ternal assistance and creditworthiness.
Prospects for 1975
4.        Egypt has recently initiated a number of significant steps in
furtherance of principles which should lead to a significant restructuring of
the economy. These principles were enunciated in the "October Paper", pre-
sented in the Spring of 1974 by President Sadat to the people and the
Parliament, and approved in a national referendum. It provides a new state-
ment of general principles to guide Egyptian development; it envisages con-
solidation of state-owned enterprises, liberalization of the private sector,
incentives to private foreign investment and expanded economic cooperation
with Arab countries. Meanwhile, new external relationships have evolved
between Egypt, its oil-producing Arab and other neighbors, Western countries,
and Japan, resulting in increased official and private capital inflows. These
developments are mutually interdependent and self-reinforcing. Thus, the
increased availability of capital will permit greater liberalization of the
economy, which, in turn, should improve the investment climate.



- 2 -
5.        Recently, the Government launched an Interim Development Program for
the period July 1974 - December 1975, the purpose of which is to initiate a
meaningful development strategy consistent with available resources and, to
commence restructuring the economy for long-term development. This Program
will be followed by a development plan for 1976-80, work on which was begun
in November, 1974. A sum of BE 520 million ($1,331 million equivalent) was
budgeted for public sector investment expenditures in 1974. This is about
20 percent above the 1973 budget level of BE 430 million (actual public
expenditure was hE 380 million). Due to price increases, the budget was in-
creased to BE 700 million in 1974 through supplementary allocation in the
course of the year. In 1975 the Government foresees a further 40 percent
increase (BE 300 million) over the actual 1974 allocation, based on greater
availabilities of foreign project aid, including expenditures on the Suez-
clediterranean pipeline and Suez Canal. It excludes, however, investments in
joint ventures which are estimated to reach about LE 50 million annually begin-
ning in 1975. The share of private investment, which, in recent years, has
averaged about 10 percent of total investments, is expected to increase to
over 20 percent by 1980.
6.        In large part, Egypt's investment programs for 1974 and 1975 are
limited to completing or continuing carry-over projects. They emphasize
fertilizers, cement, tourism (private sector) and petroleum and pipeline
development -- all high priority projects aimed at increasing production or
saving or generating foreign exchange earnings. In agriculture the priority
given to increasing the amount of arable land, and to poultry rather than to
livestock also seem appropriate to the country's needs. Programs to renovate
or improve the infrastructure (e.g. railways, telecommunications) are clearly
urgent because it had been run-down during years of under-investment. Thus,
Egypt's investment programs for the years 1974 and 1975 appear to be in
accordance with economic priorities.
7.        The resumption of full-capacity growth and the beginning of recon-
struction is expected to increase import requirements substantially in the
short-run, resulting in sizeable deficits in external trade and services (over
$1 billion each in 1974 and 1975). Although part of these deficits can be ex-
pected to be financed through grants from other Arab countries, large amounts
of additional assistance will be required on concessionary terms.
External Assistance
8.        Egypt obtained substantial amounts of external aid until the mid-
1960's. Thereafter, new commitments of Westdrn assistance practically ceased.
The gross inflow of medium- and long-term capital fell by nearly 50 percent
immediately after the 1967 war. Although aid levels gradually rose again,
net inflows averaged only $9 million annually in medium- and long-term capital
over the five-year period FY 1968-1972; amortization payments exceeded dis-
bursements by $5 million in 1973. As indicated in the economic report, the
total capital inflow required to cover the current account deficits for 1974
and 1975 is projected at $1,450 million. Assuming net disbursements of $990



- 3 -
million on loans committed as of mid-1974, private capital inflows of $120
million, I,F financing of $48 million and a reduction of $600 million in the
use of short-term foreign financing the financing gap for the two-year period
is projected at $900 million. Also given the high absorptive capacity of the
economy, and the low level of investments over the past decade, the need for
external aid commitments in the succeeding years is expected to remain at a
high level.
9.        Substantial Arab aid was received in 1973 and is continuing.    A
$300 million grant from Saudi Arabia was reported in August 1974, while Abu
Dhabi and Qatar pledged $33 million and $10 million respectively. Large aid
offers have also been made by Kuwait. Non-Arab foreign aid has also been
considerable. Four countries have committed new loans to be used over periods
varying from two to five years (Iran $850 million, United States $250 million,
Germany $225 million, Denmark $9 million) and Japan has announced its intention
to do so ($100 million). In addition, the Government has concluded two Euro-
dollar loans totalling $180 million and is currently negotiating a third ($100
million). Also, in August 1974 the IMF extended a credit (first tranche) of
$48 million. A large share of new loans is for unidentified projects and will
be disbursed only gradually over the next few years. In November 1974 Saudi
Arabia agreed to extend further project assistance amounting to $161 million
to finance the foreign exchange requirements of four projects selected by the
Bank Group for financing.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
10.       Egypt's public external civilian debt disbursed and outstanding at
September 30, 1974 is estimated at $2.7 billion. In addition to this, there
was short-term public debt of about $1.0 billion, and another $1.25 billion
of non-resident deposits at the Central Bank. The USSR was Egypt's prin-
cipal creditor, followed in importance by the United States, Kuwait, Italy,
Czechoslovakia and Germany. IBRD/IDA debt comprised less than 1 percent of
the total. On the reported external public debt at September 30, 1974, about
41 percent was due to be repaid within two years, 50 percent within three years,
and 57 percent within four years. Service payments on these debts were esti-
mated to reach $530 million in 1974, equivalent to about 25 percent of the
country's gross foreign exchange earnings.
11.       The expected large current deficits in 1974 and 1975 together with
heavy debt service payments, call for very substantial amounts of foreign
capital in the short-run. As the existing pipeline of projects suitable for
foreign financing is still not very full, much of this assistance will have
to be made available in the form of program aid. The commitments already
made by foreign donors will meet a portion of these short-term requirements,
and enable increased utilization of capacity in the economy.
12.       In the medium- and longer-run, the outlook for Egypt's balance of
payments is much more promising. Foreign exchange earnings are expected to
grow from a level of some $1.7 billion in 1974 to about $4.7 billion in 1980,
because of the reopening of the Suez Canal (announced for June 5, 1975), the
operation of the Sumed pipeline, rapidly rising exports of petroleum and



- 4 -
petroleum products, a doubling of manufactured exports, increased workers'
remittances, and the development of tourism. Imports of goods and services,
can be expected to grow very rapidly over the next 3 to 4 years, but after
that they will rise at a slower pace. As a result, the deficit on external
trade and services is projected to narrow progressively in the latter part
of the decade, significantly reducing the required net inflow of foreign
capital. Following the rapid increase in export earnings, and the slower
growth and consolidation of external debt, the debt service ratio could
fall to some 15 percent by 1980.
13.       To attain these objectives it is necessary that Egypt not only
mobilize substantial amounts of capital, preferably on concessionary terms
from abroad, but also pursue appropriate debt management, fiscal and aid-
utilization policies. In addition, domestic savings will have to be increased
through restraint in public and private consumption. The Government's deter-
mination to continue the liberalization of the economy should facilitate this
process. In particular, steps will have to be taken to: rationalize the
price system (including the relation to world market prices), stimulate the
latent potential of Egypt's private sector, and improve the management of
overall Government economic operations, including the reduction of bureau-
cratic bottlenecks and decentralization of decisions to the enterprise level.
The Government has already taken a number of measures in this direction during
the last year. Discussions are being conducted with the IMF towards achieving
specific targets with respect to debt management. Furthermore, active dis-
cussions are under way between the Bank Group and Egypt on economic policies.
In the course of these discussions, the Government has indicated that it
expects to initiate effective additional measures on many of the matters
referred to above, and to seek assistance, where necessary, from the Bank
Group in formulating such measures. Such assistance has already been initi-
ated in the field of debt management, and an agricultural sector review mis-
sion visited Egypt in January 1975. The next economic mission, scheduled
to visit Egypt in May 1975 will review the measures taken by the Government.
14.       Assuming that (i) these policy initiatives are implemented, and (ii)
the substantial aid offers committed or received can be absorbed rapidlv,
Egypt should, wihile facing a short-term liquidity problem, experience little
difficulty in meeting its external payments obligations in the medium and long-
term.  While carrying a heavy short-term debt burden (1974/76), Egypt can be
considered creditworthy for some Bank lending in view of its promising medium-
and long-term prospects.
PART II - BANI\ GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT
15.       The proposed loan would be the bank Group's sixteenth lending ope-
ration in Egypt. It would bring Bank and IDA commitments to $434.6 million.
Annex II contains a Summary of Bank Loans and IDA Credits as of March 31,
1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 5 -
16.       In view of Egypt's substantially increased need for external
assistance to help finance an expanded development program, its size and
absorptive capacity, and the several economic policy measures taken and con-
templated by the Government to restore creditworthiness, it is proposed to
increase significantly the scope of Bank Group lending from this fiscal year
onwards, with available IDA funds being supplemented by Bank loans. The
proposed credit would bring Bank/IDA commitments to Egypt for this fiscal
year to $227.0 million. Bank Group lending is directed at assisting the
Government's efforts to increase utilization of existing productive capacity;
at projects for the rehabilitation of infrastructure, which is necessary
to facilitate growth in the economic sectors; and at projects that will in-
crease foreign exchange earnings or substitute for imports. The choice of
projects within a given sector is influenced by the scope for providing
assistance in establishing priorities within that sector, and for effecting
long-term institutional and policy reforms.
17.       In the context of the expanding economic activity and the proposed
1976-80 development plan, the Government has requested Bank Group advice on
policy matters. It is therefore expected that technical assistance, both
project and non-project, will also increase significantly, and will constitute
an essential ingredient of Bank Group participation in Egypt's economic
development.  It might also be noted that the Government attaches particular
importance to the catalytic role of the Bank Group financing and is actively
exploring the interest of other donors in complementary financing of projects.
In fact, all the projects financed by the Bank Group in this fiscal year in
Egypt have involved co-financing with other sources.
18.       Bank Group disbursements would represent a small portion, less than
10 percent, of Egypt's overall capital inflow requirements (see para. 8).
The Bank Group's share of the total external debt outstanding and disbursed
was less than 1 percent at end 1973. For the future, the Bank/IDA share of
total external debt outstanding and disbursed is estimated to reach about 10
percent in 1978; the Bank's share in 1978 would be about 7 percent of exter-
nal debt outstanding and disbursed. It is estimated that in 1978, debt serv-
ice payments due to the Bank Group, including that on Bank loans, will re-
present about 1 percent of service payments due on all of Egypt's external
debt.
19.       So far, in FY75, the Executive Directors have approved a Credit and
a loan for the Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project, a loan for the
Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project, a loan for the Tourah Cement Expansion
Project and a loan for the Second Railways Project. Besides the present
project, a second DFC project with the Bank of Alexandria has also been ap-
praised. Other projects under preparation include textile rehabilitation,
production and marketing of fruits and vegetables, the Port of Alexandria
improvement and soil amelioration. Following the visit of the recent agri-
culture sector mission (see para. 13), a further priority project for weed
control in irrigation and drainage canals throughout the country, which would
complement the two drainage projects in progress, is likely to be included
in the program.

PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
20.       Egypt's population, estimated at some 36 million, is highly con-
centrated along the Y-shaped Nile valley and delta, and in the past, in the
area adjoining the Suez Canal. The urban population accounts for about 45
percent of the total. Major centers of commercial, industrial and government
activities are scattered along the Alexandria-Cairo-Aswan corridor extending
over about 1,000 km. Revival of activity in the Suez Canal area has also
begun. The telecommunication facilities in existence today are inadequate to
serve the current demand satisfactorily.
21.       The various measures taken by the Government and elaborated earlier
(para. 4) to accelerate the pace of economic development through consolida-
tion of public sector industries, steps to expand private sector activity
and foreign investments, the reopening of the Suez Canal and restoration of
economic activity in the principal Canal Zone cities, including the estab-
lishment of free zones for development of industries, are all expected to
place a further heavy demand on the telecommunications system in Egypt.
Sector Organization
22.       The Arab Republic of Egypt Telecommunications Organization (ARETO)
is responsible for the operation, management and development of public tele-
communications facilities in Egypt. Like most other public sector organiza-
tions, ARETO is a semi-autonomous organization under the general responsibil-
ity of a cabinet minister, in this case the Minister of Transport and Com-
munications. ARETO is administered by a nine-member Board of Directors,
seven of whom are representatives of other ministries. The Board is vested
with adequate powers to attend to ARETO's operational and financial policies
and decides on all matters referred to it by the Chairman. The Chairman,
appointed by the President of the Republic, is responsible for day-to-day
administration and management, including procurement and staffing.
23.       ARETO's top and middle-management levels are staffed by competent
experienced officers. At present, the two intermediate positions of Deputy
Chairman (Operations) and Deputy Chairman (Technical Affairs) are both va-
cant, and hence, ten officers now report directly to the Chairman. Although
the need for staffing these two positions has not yet become critical and
work is continuing satisfactorily, it is important that they be filled, partic-
ularly when ARETO begins to expand its facilities, and the Government plans
to do so during 1976.
24.       Besides ARETO, some government agencies and ministries, such as
the Ministry of Defense, the Suez Canal Authority, the Egyptian Railways and
the Civil Aviation Authority, maintain and operate some telecommunications
facilities to meet their own special requirements. This is however not un-
usual and follows the pattern in several other member countries.



-7-
Planning
25.       The work of telecomunications planning and development is at
present divided between several units in ARETO, which are staffed by qual-
ified staff with adequate technical capacities. However, there is lack of
coordination between these units in determining relative priorities for
various telecommunications sub-projects, the timing of their execution and
selection of the least cost solutions. This situation results in higher
costs and unbalanced development, with consequent inefficient utilization
of some assets and overloading of others.
26.       Given the capital intensive nature of telecommunications facili-
ties, in order to ensure adequate returns on the investments it is necessary
that costly assets be fully utilized. Formulation of optimum development
plans within the available physical and financial resources requires system-
atic collection and analysis of data on basic planning parameters, considera-
tion of various alternatives for a least cost solution and determination of
priorities in the light of relative demands. In order to ensure the formula-
tion of optimum development plans, within its resources, ARETO has agreed to
take measures satisfactory to IDA to strengthen its Planning Department and
to improve coordination among all units. (Section 3.01(b) draft Project
Agreement).
Telecommunications Manufacturing Facilities
27.       Certain telecommunications equipment is manufactured in Egypt by
the Egyptian Telephone Company, and the Electrical Cable Company; both are
public sector companies. The former produces cross-bar telephone switching
equipment and telephone instruments, under license from L.M. Ericsson, with
ARETO as its principal customer. The latter produces wires and underground
cables both for electric power and for telephones. Production of both fac-
tories is inadequate to meet the requirements of ARETO, which therefore
imports a wide range of telecommunications equipment and cables.
Telecommunications Services and Demand
28.       The telephone density in Egypt in January 1974 was 1.32 per 100
population. The equipped capacity of the telephone system in the country,
at the end of 1973, was 373,500 lines. Of these, 324,100 lines (86.7 percent)
were automatic, installed in 59 exchanges in urban areas, including 35 ex-
changes in Cairo and Alexandria; and 49,400 lines (13.3 percent) in la679
exchanges in non-urban areas were manual. About 60 percent of the automatic
lines are Ericsson's crossbar type. The balance, 40 percent, is of the old
"rotary" type installed before 1960.   Of the latter, 60,000 lines are up to
thirty years old and worn-out. These cause considerable call failures and
are therefore in need of immediate replacement. Major cities in the Delta
region of Lower Egypt are connected by high-capacity coaxial cable systems
and a microwave system. A coaxial cable is under installation from Cairo to
Aswan in Upper Egypt. In the rest of the country, long-distance service is
provided over open-wire lines and carrier systems. Seven trunk automatic
exchanges provide direct dialling (STD) service between seven towns in the



-8-
Delta region. Telex service is available only at Cairo and Alexandria. In-
ternational telephone and telex services are operated manually over circuits
provided mainly through undersea cables to Italy and Lebanon.
29.       As of January 1, 1975, ARETO had a waiting list, in the country
as a whole, of over 166,700 (about 47 percent of the 355,500 working direct
exchange lines); many applicants for new connections have been waiting for
over five to six years. These clearly point to the inadequacy of the local
telephone service in Egypt. The average rate of growth of direct exchange
lines (DELs) has been only 5.5 percent annually over the last decade. Due
to lack of investments, total demand (DELs plus waiting list), has been in-
creasing over the past five years at an annual rate of 11.5 percent. The
real demand is probably higher because the registered waiting list does not
reflect the latent demand from potential subscribers who are discouraged from
applying by the delay of several years in obtaining connections. Even at the
conservative historical growth rate of only 11.5 percent per annum, the
demand would reach 724,000 by end of 1977, while the proposed project provides
for installation of only 108,000 new connections during this period. Conse-
quently, the unsatisfied demand or the number of waiting applicants for new
connections is expected to continue to increase to 260,500 by end of 1977.
The demand for international and telex services is also far in excess of
available capacities.
Service Quality
30.       Because of the rather low level of investments over the last sev-
eral years, the present telecommunications facilities in Egypt are inade-
quate and overloaded to cope even with the present traffic. Some of the
existing facilities are over thirty years old, and worn-out or defective.
Consequently, the quality of all telecommunications services -- local, long-
distance and international -- is extremely poor.
31.       Inability to meet local telephone demand causes heavy use of
available lines, resulting in traffic overloads and congestion. This over-
load is exacerbated by repeat calls arising out of large numbers of call
failures on old worn-out exchange equipment. Faults on defective under-
ground cables cause failures of subscribers lines and inter-exchange cir-
cuits. Reduction in availability of inter-exchange circuirts, already in-
adequate, causes further traffic congestion. The entire system is in need
of not only rehabilitation and modernization, but also considerable expansion.
32.       The quality of long-distance service is affected primarily by in-
adequate switching equipment. The STD service is congested because of in-
adequacy of trunk automatic exchange equipment. Similarly, the present
manual operation of the trunk service and international telephone services
cause serious delays due to shortages of operating positions, and result in
inefficient utilization of expensive equipment.



- 9 -
33.       The poor quality of local and long-distance telecommunications
services severely hampers both business and administration. The inadequacy
of telephone connections and the inability to provide new connections are a
bottleneck to activities of both existing and new business concerns, as well
as that of government administration.
ARETO's Accounts and Audit
34.       ARETO's accounting system is on an accrual basis and is generally
satisfactory. Accounting records are satisfactory, except for plant records
which are now maintained by both the engineering and accounting departments
without proper coordination; but this is now being remedied. Besides this,
assets are being revalued; on completion of this work, all plant records will
be adjusted to record the new agreed values and will thereafter be maintained
an a continuing basis. ARETO has agreed to complete the asset revaluation
by December 31, 1976 and to incorporate the results of the revaluation in its
accounts. (Section 4.05, draft Project Agreement).
35.       Billing and collection procedures are satisfactory.    Accounts re-
ceivable include approximately LE 5 million of arrears due from various gov-
ernmental departments. This sum has accumulated since 1957, when ARETO was
first incorporated; it has arisen through differences between amounts billed
by ARETO and lesser amounts approved for telephone services in the budgets of
the various government departments. While budgeting is now on a more real-
istic basis, and the current telephone bills are being paid by government
departments, the problem of the old accumulated arrears has not been re-
solved, despite discussions between the Government and ARETO. The Government
has agreed that it will, in conjunction with ARETO, complete by June 30,
1976 the identification of all outstanding arrears as of December 31, 1974,
and settle the agreed outstanding balance by December 31, 1977. (Section
4.02 draft Credit Agreement; Section 4.06 draft Project Agreement). Except
for these old arrears, the balance of accounts receivable is reasonable.
36.       Accounting procedures include provision for both pre- and post-
audit. The pre-audit is carried out by ARETO staff and the post-audit, on
a continuing basis, by government auditors. This arrangement is satisfactory.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that ARETO will submit audited
accounts within six months of the end of each fiscal year to the Association.
(Section 4.02 draft Project Agreement).
Tariffs
37.       Telecomaiunications tariffs, which require the approval of the
President of the Republic, were last increased in 1966. At that time, all
basic rates were increased by 50 percent. At current levels, the tariffs
are projected to produce an adequate rate of return for ARETO until about
1978; they will also generate 18 percent of the funds required for ARETO's
expansion program, which is satisfactory in view of the rapid acceleration
of investment in the period.



- 10 -
38.       Although the level and structure of tariffs are generally satis-
factory, the revenue per exchange line is low. This is, in part, due to the
relatively large number of free calls included in the rental charges for
telephone sets, particularly for residential subscribers. ARETO also uses
a number of practices which tend to reduce trunk revenues per line, such as
barring almost all residential telephones from use of direct dialling (STD)
service and a requirement that an additional deposit be paid before operator-
serviced trunk calls can be placed from residential telephones. To remedy
these inadequacies in the tariff structure and to enable ARETO to gradually
become self-financing for its future investment program, ARETO has agreed: to
review its tariff structure and subscribers regulations, and to furnish the
Association not later than June 30, 1976 with the findings of the review, to
prepare on the basis of the findings and in consultation with the Association,
proposals in respect of the revenues per exchange line, and thereafter to
take all measures to maintain such revenues at the proposed level (Section
4.04 draft Project Agreement). The Government has also agreed to take all
measures necessary to enable ARETO to increase its revenues per exchange line
in accordance with the above obligation of ARETO (Section 4.01, draft Credit
Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Project History
39.       The Government and ARETO requested the Association to consider
financing a project for rehabilitation of telecommunications facilities in
1972. Following visits by two missions to discuss the data required for
preparation of a project, this information, compiled by ARETO, was submitted
to the Association in February 1974. Subsequently, a project preparation
mission visited Egypt in July 1974 to review the contents and priorities
of the items included in ARETO's 1975-77 program. With the assistance pro-
vided by this mission, ARETO completed the preparation of the present proj-
ect, which forms part of ARETO's overall telecommunications rehabilitation,
modernization and expansion program. The project was appraised in September
1974. Negotiations on the proposed credit were held in Washington from March
28 to April 3, 1975. The Egyptian delegation included Mr. Ahmed Effat,
Minister of State for Economic Cooperation, Mr. Rafik Sowelem, Agency for
Arab and International Economic Cooperation, and Messrs T.N. Ekdawi and
A.A. Sawabi of ARETO.
The Program
40.       The aim of ARETO's program for the period 1975-77 is to provide
infrastructure support to Egypt's national development through efficient
telecommunications services. The program is well-balanced, and is based on
correct priorities in the sector. Although modest in scope in that it will
not meet the anticipated demand, mainly because of constraints of available
financing, it is designed to improve the quality of service which is poor,
meet partially the demand for new local and long distance connections and pro-
vide a base for sustained future development of telecommunications facilities.



41.       The program provides for phased replacement of old worn-out local
exchange equipment and defective cables, and expansion of local, long-distance
and international telecommunications facilities in Egypt including provision
of an earth satellite station. All the components are urgently required
to meet a part of the demand and improve the quality of service. Of these,
the highest priority items have been included in the project proposed for
financing by the Association. The main elements of the program, their esti-
mated costs, including contingencies, and principal sources of external fi-
nancing are summarized below.

180.0   130.0      310.0
Thus, the total estimated cost of the program is LE 121.0 million (US$310.0
million), with a foreign exchange component of LE 50.8 million (US$130.0
million).
42.       The major items of ongoing works are the Cairo-Alexandria-Tripoli
(Libya) microwave system under installation, the Cairo-Aswan coaxial cable



- 12 -
system of which 350 km (out of 850 km) are already commissioned, and expan-
sion of the Cairo trunk automatic exchange. Foreign exchange financing for
these ongoing works has been fully secured from bilateral sources. Foreign
exchange financing for both the Project and the other new works in the Pro-
gram has been obtained, subject to certain confirmations, as detailed in
paragraphs 41 and 45. Preparatory works for the post-1977 program are also
included in the present program but financing for these items will not be
required until 1976.
The Project
43.       The project proposed for financing by the Association, forms part
of the aforementioned program, and consists of the expansion of the local
telephone network and the telex system. It comprises the installation of:
(i) local exchange equipment together with subscriber and inter-exchange
telephone cables in Cairo, Alexandria and other provinces (including replace-
ment of some worn-out exchange equipment and defective telephone cables); (ii)
telephone instruments and other subscribers' facilities; and (iii) 3440 lines
of telex exchanges and 2500 teleprinters. An appraisal report entitled, "Arab
Republic of Egypt -- Telecommunications Organization, Appraisal of a Telecom-
munications Project" (No. 631-EGT) dated April 11, 1975 is being distributed
separately. Details of the project are shown in the Credit and Project Sum-
mary in Annex III. The project is estimated to cost LE 67.7 million (US$173.4
million) with a foreign exchange content of LE 30.2 million (US$77.4 million).
44.       The $30 million being provided by IDA towards the foreign exchange
costs of the project would be relent to ARETO for a term of 20 years, including
three years of grace, at an effective cost of 8.5 percent per annum. It has
been agreed that ARETO would bear the foreign exchange risk on the subsidiary
loan (Section 3.01(a), draft Development Credit Agreement).
Financing Plan
45.       The remaining foreign exchange costs would be covered (a) by Swedish
supplier's credits, $19.1 million; (b) from Saudi Arabia, $13.4 million; (c)
from France, $4.0 million; and (d) by the Government of Egypt, $10.9 million.
Swedish financing will be provided on terms ranging from six and a half to
eight years with annual interest at 6.5 percent. The terms of the Saudi
Arabian financing have not been determined but are likely to be better than
those applicable to suppliers' credits. One-third of the funds from France
will be as a loan from the Government for a term of 20 years, including two
years grace, with annual interest at 3.5 percent; the remainder will be as
suppliers' credits repayable over ten years with interest at the rate pre-
vailing in France when the supply contract is signed. The foreign exchange
to be made available by the Government is for the provision of imported equip-
ment and raw materials for the local factory (Section 3.02, draft Credit
Agreement). The conclusion of arrangements for the provision of foreign
exchange from Sweden, Saudi Arabia and France totalling $36.5 million, would
be a condition of effectiveness (Section b.01(c), draft Credit Agreement).



- 13
46.       The foreign exchange requirements for the balance of the program
have been provisionally arranged with Saudi Arabia ($14.6 million) and through
Swedish suppliers' credits ($3.3 million). These arrangements are subject
to confirmation but, in any event, delays in securing this financing would not
affect the project works which, with the ongoing works form a viable package.
Local currency funds in excess of ARETO's own earnings needed for the project
and the program (Section 3.01(a), draft Credit Agreement) as a whole will be
provided as loans by the Government at 4.5 percent interest repayable over
14 years.
Project Execution
47.       ARETO staff have the capability for planning, detailed engineering
and execution of all works under the project. ARETO staff would also install
all exchange equipment (local telephone and telex), Private Automatic Branch
Exchanges (PABXs) and Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) equipment and undertake all
works relating to installation of telephone cables.
Procurement and Disbursement
48.       All equipment financed under the proposed credit will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group 's
guidelines. Other items included in the project, but not proposed for fi-
nancing under the credit, namely local telephone exchange equipment, PBXs,
PABXs and telephone instruments will be procured partly from the local
factory. The remainder of these items, and the telex exchanges and tele-
phones, will be procured from Swidish and French sources (in amounts equi-
valent to the financing provided by Sweden and France respectively) and through
international tenders. The proposed credit will be disbursed against the CIF
costs of all imported equipment. The present project represents the start of
a continuing development program for the telecommunications sector. It is
therefore proposed that any unused balances of the credit should be applied,
after consultation with the Association, towards the foreign exchange costs
of goods similar to those financed under the proposed credit, and required
for ARETO's development program.
Finances
49.       As of December 31, 1973, ARETO's total assets amounted to $207
million equivalent, of which total fixed assets accounted for $176 million
equivalent. Long-term debt from non-government sources was $12 million equi-
valent and represented some six percent of total capital and liabilities,
while interest-bearing loans from the Government amounted to $76 million
equivalent. At the end of each financial year, ARETO pays its net income
to Government except for the portion of the internal cash generation rep-
resented by the annual depreciation charge which it retains, subject to
amortization of government debt. In the past, ARETO's investments have
been largely financed by the Government, except for small amounts of fi-
nancing which have been obtained from bilateral sources and suppliers'
credits. Government investment is represented by equity, as well as loans
which require payment of interest at 4.5 percent per annum.



- 14 -
50.       ARETO's revenues are expected to rise from LE 25 million in 1973 to
LE 50 million in 1979. Over the project period, ARETO's rate of return on
nec fixea assets is projected at between 12.6 and 13.8 percent. From 1978
onwards, the rate of return declines and a revenue increase of approximately
five percent in 1979 may be required to maintain an 11 percent rate of re-
turn which is considered to be a reasonable minimum which would provide
funds for debt servicing and self-financing of future programs. The review
of the tariff structure and its rationalization, and the elimination of
barriers to long-distance calls (see para 40) could raise revenues sufficiently
and make an increase in tariffs unnecessary. However, ARETO and the Govern-
ment have agreed to take all measures necessary including the adjustment of
tariffs to enable ARETO to earn an annual return of not less than 11 percent
on net fixed assets in operation (Section 4.03, draft Project Agreement;
Section 4.01, draft Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Justification
51.       The provision of about 108,000 new telephone lines will help meet a
part of the demand, although, at the end of the project period, the waiting
list will still be much higher than at present. However, with this modest ex-
pansion and replacement of 36,500 lines of old worn-out equipment, service
quality will improve significantly. Telex exchanges will provide an essen-
tial telecommunication service now lacking in most parts of the country.
Under the program the existing network of long-distance telecommunications
facilities will be strengthened and extended to Upper and Lower Egypt, in-
cluding rural areas, resulting in a 50 percent increase in long-distance
circuits. The long-distance items under the program will relieve present
bottlenecks, facilitate better utilization of existing and new circuits and
result in a fast and efficient long-distance service. Egypt is one of the
few countries of its size without an earth station, and the earth station
included under the program, by providing direct circuits to Europe, the
American continent, parts of Asia and Africa, will supplement the existing
cable service through other countries and help significantly to improve com-
munications between Egypt and other countries. Other facilities under the
program for international communications will pave the way for future auto-
matic operation of the present manual facilities.
52.       The program and project provide a satisfactory framework for future
development of telecommunications services in Egypt, and represent the least
cost alternative. The project's quantifiable economic rate of return is es-
timated at 16 percent, which is satisfactory.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       Ihe draft Credit Agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and
the Association, the draft Project Agreement between ARETO and the Associa-
tion, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section



- 15 -
I(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approv-
ing the proposed development credit, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
54.       Additional conditions of effectiveness include the condition that
the Government and ARETO shall have obtained financing in an amount equivalent
to $36,500,000 to contribute to the foreign exchange costs of the Project,
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Association (Section 6.01(c),
draft Development Credit Agreement).
56.       Features of the development Credit and Project Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 26, 34, 35, 36, 38, 44, 45, 46 and 50
of this Report.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
58.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 181-UAR - Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit of April
17, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
In 1973 a revised implementation program was prepared, extending
this project until 1978, and the government agreed to take a number of ac-
tions recommended by IDA to improve project performance and provide effec-
tive management. In February 1973, the National Drainage Development Author-
ity (NDDA) and the Egyptian General Authority for Drainage (EGAD) were merged
in the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP) established by
Presidential Decree. A new Chairman and Vice Chairman for the Nile Delta and
Upper Egypt Drainage Projects were appointed and the staff reorganized and
strengthened by the appointment of additional qualified personnel. A panel
of experts was nominated to undertake project evaluation, and action is being
taken to replace the consultants who advise and assist the Authority on the
implementation of both the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt projects. The new Au-
thority is actively working on the arrangements for the maintenance of equip-
ment and the storage of spare parts and has drafted the terms and conditions
under which project equipment will be transferred to local contractors for
construction of drainage works and for the manufacture of drainage tiles.
During last year, supervision missions expressed concern that sufficient
local currency funds lhas not been budgeted to keep project implementation
up to the pace agreed in the revised schedule; this matter was discussed
with the Government in May and again in September 1974, and a small supple-
mentary allocation was made to permit continued implementation for the rest
of 1974. Sufficient local currency has been allocated in the approved 1975
national budget and project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 284-UAR - Egyptian Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of February
9, 1972; Closing Date: (i) December 31, 1975, for track materials, loco-
motives and spare parts; and (ii) September 30, 1976, for signalling and
telecommunications equipment and installation.
The project is being implemented satisfactorily. Most of the pro-
curement contracts have been awarded, and the bulk of the credit has been
committed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. S-13-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Engineering Project;
USS175,000 Credit of November 17, 1972; Closing Date:    November 30, 1973.
Thiis Credit was approved on November 7, 1972, and was declared
effective on June 15, 1973.   It has been fully disbursed and subsequently
refinanced under Cr. 423 below.
Cr. No. 393-UAR - Upper Egypt Drainage Project; US$36 million Credit of June
8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress in implementing the project had been slow. During last
year supervision missions reported insufficient budgeting of local currency
funds for the current fiscal year. The matter was taken up with the Govern-
ment, in May and again in September 1974 and a small supplementary allocation
was made to enable project implementation to continue. The schedule for work
in 1975 is satisfactory and sufficient local currency funds are available.
Implementation of the project, including the bilharzia control program is now
proceeding satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 412-UAR - Bank of Alexandria Project; US$15 million Credit of June 29,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
This Credit became effective on November 29, 1973. Since then, BOA
has approved several subprojects.   As of March 1975, almost the entire $15.0
million of thie credit has been committed. The small remaining balance is ex-
pected to be committed shortly.
Cr. No. 423-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project; US$18.5 million
Credit of July 30, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This Credit became effective on February 15, 1974. A program for
retraining of displaced workers, prepared by Egypt has been reviewed by IDA
and implementation will commence shortly. Prices of bids received in Mlay 1974
for major equipment packages were much higher than expected, and the total
estimated foreign exchange cost is presently estimated to be about $41.5 mil-
lion. In November, 1974, Saudi Arabia agreed to provide $23 million to fi-
nance the cost overrun thus enabling implementation of the project as ap-
praised.  Awards for most of the major contracts have been made.
Cr. No. 437-UAR - Population Project; US$5.0 million Credit of November 6,
1973; Closing Date: I)ecember 31, 1977.
This Credit was declared effective on March 25, 1974. The architects
hlave been appointed, and work is underway on other elements of the project.

Credit of Niovember 20, 1973; Closing Date:  March 31, 1975.
Tiis Credit was declared effective on April 24, 1974. tleanwhile, a
consulting firm, appointed as the technical advisors, did some of the work
covered by this credit and was paid by Egypt. The credit was refinanced under
Cr. 484 below.
