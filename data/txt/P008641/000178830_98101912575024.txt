POWER PROJECT VII
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01     Portugal's commercial energy resources consist of hydropower,
uranium, and small deposits of poor quality coal.  No commercially exploitable
petroleum deposits have yet been found, but two areas considered to have
prospects for the discovery of oil and gas are being explored. The country is
also well endowed with renewable sources of energy in the form of firewood,
crop residues and animal wastes, mini-hydropower and solar radiation.
1.02     The hydropower potential is estimated at about 27 TWh per year under
average hydrological conditions, of which about 20 TWh relate to large and
medium size schemes, and the remaining to mini or micro sites. 1/ Of the
large and medium size schemes, about 85% (17 TWh) could be developed
economically by the year 2010. Presently, about 48% of the 20 TWh potential
has already been developed and another 12% will be developed by 1988.  Proven
recoveraDle reserves of coal (anthracite with 4,100 kcal/kg) are estimated at
5 million tons. Annual production is approximately 220,000 tons, sufficient
for supplying the 150-MW power plant at Tapada do Outeiro. Lignite reserves
have not yet been fully delineated but presently known reserves (about 33
million tons) are only sufficient to sustain a 250 MW plant for 12 years. The
feasibility study for the construction of a lignite fired power plant and the
development of the associated mine at Rio Maior conducted in 1977, concluded
that the economics were against such a venture. However, further real
increases in fuel oil prices could justify such a project in the future.
Therefore in late 1980, Electricidade De Portugal (EDP), appointed a
consultant to review the existing study, and the evaluation of an alternative
whicn calls for the construction of a 250 MW plant to be fired with lignite
for the first 12 years and thereafter with imported coal. Portugal's reserves
of uranium are estimated at 8,200 tons (in concentrates) which would suffice
to provide fuei for three 1,000-MW reactors for 25 years. Due to the lead
time required in choosing the appropriate site, constructing the facilities,
and training staff, nuclear power in Portugal will not be a feasible
alternative to either coal or oil until 1995. Thus Government has not yet
decided to proceed with the implementation of its program for the development
of nuclear power. However, mining of uranium has started at a very slow rate
(100 tons per year) and the mined ore to date (2,000 tons in concentrates) is
partly exported and partly stockpiled. In addition, EDP has decided to
conduct a study for the identification of possible nuclear plant sites (para.
3.05).
1/  Throughout this report the term "average hydroelectric generation" would
refer to generation corresponding to average hydrological conditions which
is the mean of a 30-year period and makes allowance for water going over
the spillways, and plant availability.

1.03     Except for hydro power, fuelwood is the most widely used source of
renewable energy. Crop residues and animal wastes are also used in the rural
areas, although detailed data are not available. However, the study of the
National Energy Plan (NEP) initiated in 1980 under the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) financing (para. 1.15), would provide
the required data for determining the extent of biomass usage. Solar energy
usage is limited to small water heating systems in the residential sector.
Good quality water heaters are produced locally (a few thousand units a year)
but the incentives currently provided by the Government are not sufficient to
promote their use. The issue is being examined by the Government in the
review of its general energy policy (para 1.14).
Sectoral Organization
1.04     The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Exports (MIEE) has jurisdiction
over most energy-related matters. The Directorate General for Energy (DGE) at
MIEE is responsible for the formulation and implementation of energy policies,
preparation of energy forecasts, review and coordination of investment plans,
price setting, and the establishment of energy conservation measures. DGE
also oversees the activities of the three state-owned companies, Petroleos de
Portugal (PETROGAL), EDP, and Empresa de Petroquimica e Gas (EPG), and all
other power distributors currently operating in Portugal.   PETROGAL is
responsible for exploration for oil and gas, and importing, refining,
distributing and marketing petroleum products. PETROGAL's sales account for
about 80% of all petroleum products sold in Portugal. The remaining 20% of
sales are shared among three international companies, Shell, Mobil, and
British Petroleum.
1.05     Presently the power subsector consists of EDP, the 4 Port Authorities
which generate their own power, and 116 municipal and private undertakings,
all under the control of MIEE. Apart from some private industries which sell
small quantities of electricity locally, and some small irrigation schemes
which sell electricity to EDP (jointly they account for about 2% of total
sales), EDP is responsible for power generation and transmission and for the
distribution of about 73% of all the publicly-sold electricity in Portugal,
while the municipal and private undertakings distribute the remaining 27%. In
addition, in the Lisbon area EDP distributes town gas purchased from EPG.
Energy Supply and Consumption
1.06     Supply:  Portugal is heavily dependent on imported crude oil and
petroleum products for meeting its demand for energy. In 1981, domestic
production of primary energy accounted for only 17% of the total commercial
energy supply and the remaining 83% was imported, primarily in the form of
crude oil, petroleum products and some coal.   Between 1973 and 1981, the
annual oil import bill increased from US$100 million to US$2.4 billion.
During the same period, oil imports, as a share of export earnings, increased
from about 5% to 58%. To deal with the problem in the 1980's the Government
is reviewing its energy policy (para 1.14). The table below gives the actual
and forecast Energy Balance of the country.

/1  Hydropower is expressed as the amount of fossil fuel required to generate
the same amount of electricity in existing conventional thermal stations
(about 0.23 toe/1,000 kWh).
/2  In 1981, imports of petroleum products consisted mainly of fuel oil
(900,000 tons, expected to rise to 1.7 million tons in 1984) and diesel
oil (15,000 tons, expected to reach 580,000 tons in 1984).
/3  Energy content of generated electricity (0.086 toe/1,000 kWh).
Assumption:
Tne above energy balance was derived on the following assumptions:
(i) GDP growth of 2.8% between 1982 and 1984;
(ii)  GDP growth of 2.0% between 1985 and 1987;
(iii)  Petroleum product demand growth of 4.4% p.a. between 1982-1985;
(iv)  Petroleum product demand growth of 3.2% p.a. between 1986-1990; and
(v)  Commissioning of 2x300 MW coal-fired units in the period 1988-1990.



-4-
1.07     Consumption:  In 1981, per capita energy consumption in Portugal was
about 1,800 kgce compared with 7,600 kgce for the industrial market
economies. Total final energy consumption amounted to 8.1 mtoe in 1981, with
petroleum products and electricity accounting for 73% and 15% of the total
respectively, the balance being accounted for by coal (3%), town gas (1%) and
wood (8%). The petroleum products consumed were LPG (8%), gasoline (11%),
diesel oil (26%), fuel oil (53%), and other products (2%).
1.08     Industry, road transport, and the power sector account for 33%, 31%,
and 16% respectively of the domestic consumption of petroleum products. Use
of fuel oil in power generation has doubled in the last five years, and now
power generation accounts for over one-third of total fuel oil consumed in the
country.
Trends in the Consumption of Electricity
1.09     Portugal's population is estimated at about 9.9 million, of which 88%
have access to electricity service. Of the population without electricity
service (238,000 families), about 99,000 families live in rural settlements
with more than 50 inhabitants, while the remaining 139,000 families live in
settlements with less than 50 inhabitants. Consumption of electricity between
1970 and 1981 rose by 7.8% p.a. (from 6,282 GWh to 14,276 GWh). During the
same period, peak load more than doubled, from 1,355 MW to 3,179 MW.
Presently industry accounts for about 59% of total sales, households and
services 38%, transport 2%, and agriculture 1%. As disposable income has
risen, sales to the residential and services sectors have increased rapidly in
recent years.   However, per capita electricity consumption remains among the
lowest in Europe (about 1,440 kWh/capita).
Energy Pricing
1.10     Petroleum Products:  Ex-refinery and retail prices of petroleum
products are set by Government with heavier taxes imposed on lighter products,
and lighter taxes or subsidies extended to heavier distillates used by the
power subsector and industry. In 1981 four products (gasoline, kerosene,
diesel-oil, and fuel-oil) accounted for about 90% of petroleum product
consumption. During the same year, prices of petroleum products were
increased twice; once in January 1, and again in July 1. After the second
price increase the weighted average retail price of the above four products
was Esc. 21,632/ton, 9.3% higher than the corresponding total domestic cost of
Esc. 19,786/ton. 1/ Thus sales of these products would have generated in 1981
net taxes of Esc. 11,700 million (about US$180 million) and after setting off
Esc. 1,100 million to subsidize asphalts, paraffin, solvents, etc., this would
nave left Esc. 10,600 million (about US$160 million) in net taxes from the
sale of petroleum products. However, with the escudo's devaluation vis-a-vis
the aollar of an overall 18% in 1981, increases in the price of petroleum
products introduced in 1981 were not sufficient to cover the exchange rate
1/ Total domestic cost includes CIF costs, refining and distribution costs,
and related profit margins.



differential estimated to reach Esc. 15,800 million by December 31, 1981.
Thus, the end result in 1981 was a subsidy of Esc. 5,200 million (about US$80
million) for petroleum products.   To remedy the situation, the Government
increased on January 1, 1982 and again on July 1, the prices of gasoline by a
total of 16%, kerosene and diesel oil by 28%, and fuel oil by 39%. In
addition, the Government has revised the system of setting ex-refinery prices
with a view to enabling PETROGAL to recover in full the financing costs
associated with the import of crude oil.
A summary of domestic costs, prices, and taxes for 1981 and 1982 are presented
in the table below:

1.11     Portugal's pricing policy for petroleum products has led to some
distortions in consumption patterns, particularly in the transportation
sector. The retail price of diesel oil in 1981, although above its total
domestic cost, was only 40% that of gasoline. This had led to a 60% increase
in diesel consumption as compared with a marked decline in gasoline
consumption since 1975.  To indirectly reduce this price differential, the
Government levied in 1981 an annual tax of about US$600 on diesel operated
venicles.
1.12     Electricity Tariffs:  Since EDP's creation, electricity tariffs to be
charged to each customer class have been proposed by EDP and set by the
Government. In formulating its tariff proposals, EDP has been assuming
average hydroelectric generation computed on the basis of 30 years'
hydrological conditions. The current tariff structure is based on the
principle of marginal cost pricing and distinguishes between consumers in four
groups according to the voltage level of service; low voltage (up to 1 kV);
medium voltage (from 1 to 30 kV); high voltage (60 kV); and very high voltage
(above 60 kV). Low voltage consumers are further subdivided into two groups
according to their subscribed demand; above 13.6 kVA, and below 13.6 kVA.
Except for LV consumers below the 13.6 kVA level, all groups have a two-part
tariff (demand charge, and energy charge) with additional tariff structures
(interruptible demand, two-rate time-of-day, etc) also available at the
customer's option (Annex 1.1).
1.13     Since 1978, EDP's tariffs increased at least once a year by an
average of about 35% to more than keep up with inflation (para 4.03). In
addition, EDP was allowed in 1977 to levy a fuel adjustment charge. Although
eacn increase contributed to bringing the level of tariffs closer to their
marginal cost of supply, the average tariff (Esc. 4.616/kWh), after the
increase of January 1, 1982 was only 78% (Annex 1.1) of its marginal cost and
this percentage is expected to increase as tariffs continue to increase in the
future (para 4.14). On January 3, 1983, EDP's tariffs were again increased by
an average of 29% (including the fuel adjustment charge for the first half of
tne year).
Energy Policy
1.14     Energy policy in Portugal has developed in response to an increasing
reliance on oil imports, particularly since 1973. The basic thrust of the
Government's long range energy policy is to diversify its energy sources and
to develop its domestic resources, in order to reduce dependence on imported
oil. The Government plans to increase the use of domestic and foreign coal in
electricity generation and in industry (particularly in cement plants),
develop the country's still unexploited hydro potential, intensify exploration
for oil and gas, promote production of liquid and gaseous fuels from biomass,
and encourage the use of solar energy for water heating in homes and public
buildings.
1.15     In the short run, the Government is  putting heavy emphasis on energy
conservation. Its overall target is 10-15% energy savings across the board by
1990. One of the major efforts in this direction has been the introduction of
a program for providing financial assistance for conversion to energy-saving
tecnnologies. Implementation of this program, under the supervision of DGE,
was initiated in 1976 in industry, and efforts are currently under way to
extend it to the commercial and services sectors. For the long-term,



tne nation's energy needs are examined by the NEP study (the first draft was
submitted in July 1982 to the Government for review) which is conducted in
collaboration with the US Department of Energy. This study makes use of the
Decision Focus Incorporated (DFI) model which approaches the problem from a
global point of view of energy demand. The DFI model is deficient in that it
does not treat adequately technological and socioeconomic scenarios. This
deficiency was overcome by using the MEEDE 1/ model which yields end-use
energy demands by considering various technological and socioeconomic
scenarios. The output of the MEEDE model is then used as input in the DFI
model in order to yield market shares by establishing a network of the energy
system and iterating prices and flows, through the specification of pricing
and allocation behaviour of decision makers.
Bank Group Participation in the Sector
1.16     The Bank Group has made six loans for power in Portugal totalling
US$93.5 million. Five loans were made during the period 1963-1966, out of
which three were to a thermal generating company and two for hydro electric
generation. The sixth loan made in 1976 financed EDP's 1976-1978 investment
program. All projects were successfully completed. The Bank has also made
three more loans in the energy sector; a US$9.6 million (Loan 1875-PO) in 1980
for modernization of the hydropower equipment industry, a US$20 million (Loan
2024-PO) in 1981 for petroleum exploration, and a US$30 million (Loan 2168-PO)
in 1982 for industrial energy conservation.
1.17     Bank lending for energy in Portugal has not only provided the foreign
exchange needed for the projects but more impcrtantly it has contributed to
several institutional changes:
(i)  evolution of EDP's legal and organizational structure;
(ii)  development of EDP's planning methodology and procurement practices;
(iii) implementation of a revised rate structure for electricity based upon
the marginal costs of supply;
(iv)  rationalization of petroleum product pricing;
(v)  implementation of uniform financial and accounting systems and
procedures;
(vi)  adoption of a system of indicators for monitoring the technical and
financial performance of the power entity; and
(vii) energy conservation and diversification program.

II. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
2.01     Up to 1944 the power subsector in Portugal was fragmented.  Supply of
electrical power was in the hands of 274 independent utilities which served
tneir concession areas.  The electricity law of 1944 was the first attempt to
organize the power sector which for the last 38 years has been undergoing a
process of consolidation. By 1954, five companies were established; four for
hydro and thermal generation and the fifth for nationwide transmission. The
Government owned considerable stock in these companies and had a major role in
determining the policies followed by each of them. Thus the companies, though
formally private, had a quasi-public character. In addition to the five
companies, 14 large private companies were generating and distributing power
in their concession areas (99 municipalities), and 161 municipal and private
undertakings were operating small local distribution systems.
2.02     In 1969, Companhia Portuguesa de Electricidade (CPE) was formed (with
Government holding 52% of the voting stock) by merging the four generation
companies and the transmission company. In 1975, the Government by Decree Law
205-G/75 nationalized CPE and the 14 large utilities (13 operating in
continental Portugal, and one in the Azores), and in 1976 by Decree Law
502/76, created EDP by merging CPE and the 13 nationalized utilities in
continental Portugal. The same law also decreed that all private and
municipal undertakings were to be integrated with EDP over a period of time.
To resolve the problems created by this reorganization, the Government
established three Commissions to study the organizational structure of EDP,
the integration of salary scales and conditions of employment, and the
integration of the remaining distribution undertakings with EDP. The first
two Commissions accomplished their task within three months and were
disbanded, but the last accomplished little due to opposition from
municipalities to have their systems integrated with EDP. Thus the commission
recommended that a special body be set up to resolve the problem. On this
recommendation, the Government established in November 1976 the Commission to
Accompany and Arbitrate upon Transfers (CAAT). Up to the present, CAAT has
managed to complete the integration with EDP of 32 municipal undertakings and
9 private companies. Negotiations are currently under way with another 24
undertakings, and it is believed that their systems could be integrated by
1983, leaving 96 municipal and private undertakings operating outside EDP.
Historical Development
2.03     Historically the installed generating capacity of the Portuguese
system has been predominantly hydro, and the installed thermal capacity has
not been adequate to make good the deficit in hydro production during years of
drought. 1/ Deficits in electrical power were, and still are, met by imports
(through tne interconnected system) from neighboring countries, mainly
l/ Hydrological and geomorphological conditions are not very favorable for
electricity production; hydroelectric plants are mostly run-of-river and
the storage capacities are not adequate for matching seasonal load
fluctuations.

France. 1/ To remedy this deficiency of the system, and since development of
the system at least cost points, in some cases, to thermal generation, EDP is
trying to reduce the hydro to thermal ratio, but the above situation will most
probably continue for another 3-4 years, until the steam units of Setubal (3
and 4) and Sines (1 and 2) are commissioned (Annexes 2.1 and 2.2).
2.04     In the period 1976-1981, EDP's installed generating capacity
increased by 3.7% per year (from 3,166 to 3,797 MW), peak demand by 7.2% (from
2,237 to 3,170 MW), gross generation by 6.4% (from 9,293 to 12,645 GWh), while
sales increased by 7.5% (from 9,537 to 13,684 GWh), (see Annexes 2.3
and 2.4). With demand growing at a faster rate than the system, generation
reserve (as a percent of load) was -0.4% in 1978, -4.2% in 1979, -7.8% in
1980, and -6.4% in 1981. This was due to CPE's (predecessor of EDP)
inadequate investment program. To remedy the situation, EDP was forced to
invest heavily in generating facilities.  Commissioning of the Alguieira and
Setubal units in 1980 improved the generation reserve, but because of
continuing drought since 1980 the reserve margin remained negative.
2.05     The trend of electricity consumption (including losses), in total and
by consumer categories, is summarized below:
1976                 1981               1976-1981

Total             9,987    100.0         14,276   100.0 Average= 7.4
During the period 1976-1981, the overall plant factor varied considerably
(from 34 to 50X) between years depending on hydrological conditions.
2.06     Presently, EDP's installed generating capacity is 4,671 MW of which
2,622 MW is hydro, 1,715 MW is steam turbines, and the remaining 334 MW is
combustion turbines. Of the steam turbines, 1,565 MW (90%) operate on fuel
oil and the remaining 150 MW operate on a mixture of indigenous coal and fuel
oil. By 1986 EDP's installed generating capacity is projected to increase by
26% (from 4,671 MW to 5,886 MW). In spite of these substantial additions,
EDP's reserve capacity in 1986 is projected to be only about 10% (Annex 2.3).
However, this is adequate in view of the exchange arrangements with
neighboring countries.
L/ Power imports take place either in the form of exchange in kind or
purchases. However, no long-term agreements exist for firm power
purchases.



- 11 -
2.07     EDP's transmission network consists of overhead lines and substations
operated at 400, 220, and 150 kV, which interconnect the whole of the country,
as well as Portugal with Spain. The backbone of the distribution system
consists of MV lines ranging from 6 to 60 kV. Between 1976 and 1981 the total
length of both systems increased by 42% (from 28,187 to 39,888 km, with
anotner 311 km under construction in 1982) while the installed capacity of the
transformer stations increased by 73% (from 7,891 to 13,653 MVA, with another
4,241 MVA under construction). The number of HV and MV consumers doubled
(from 7,996 to 16,009), and LV consumers increased by 72% (from 1,086,500 to
1,868,400), see Annex 2.5.
2.08     Through three interconnections (2x220 kV and lx400 kV) with Spain
(see Map IBRD No. 16179), Portugal can exchange with Europe about 1,200 MW,
representing about one third of the projected peak load for 1982. This
interconnection enables Portugal to export surplus hydroelectric generation
(in years of favorable hydrological conditions) and import the energy required
during peak hours or dry seasons, thus optimizing the operation of the system
by importing energy at lower than EDP's thermal production cost, reducing
spinning reserves, installing large generating units, etc.
Load forecast
2.09     Up to 1981, EDP derived the load forecast of its sytem by using
various techniques which included: regression analysis, aggregation of
forecasts for each consumer category, and analogy of Portugal with other
countries at a comparative stage of development. In mid 1982, the first draft
of tne NEP study (para. 1.15) provided another forecasting technique which
examines the problem from a global point of view of energy demand (DFI
model). Since the load forecast depends on the general economic outlook in
the country, all projections are reviewed frequently and forecasts of energy
and demand are prepared at least once a year.
2.10     In late 1980 EDP prepared a long range forecast (to year 2010) by
using the analogy technique (comparative stage of development of European
countries). This forecast, referred to as the "Reference" forecast, yielded
an average demand growth of 6.8%. This growth was arbitrarily reduced to
5.6%, and another forecast, the "Base" forecast, was derived. A test was then
made to determine the sensitivity of both forecasts, and the technical
implications involved in moving from the Reference to the Base forecast. The
test revealed that such a move would require minor adjustments to the
development program of hydro plants and the delay by one to two years of
future coal-fired units. It was also determined that such changes could be
accommodated without major technical or financial consequences.
2.11     By July 1982, a medium term forecast was prepared by the aggregation
technique 1/. At the same time, two more forecasts were produced by using the
1/ Aggregation of independent projections for each of the four distribution
directorates (North, Central, Tejo, South). Projections of each
directorate were based on extrapolation of past trends plus information
concerning major new loads.

DFI-MEEDE model in combination with the WASP II-VALOR AGUA models. 1/ The
first forecast (A) based on the assumption that GDP would grow at the rate of
3.5% between 1982 and 1984, and 4.2% between 1985 and 1987, indicated that
demand for electricity would grow at an average rate of 6.7% p.a. between 1982
and 1990, and 5.2% from 1991 onwards. The second forecast (B) based on the
assumption that GDP would grow at the rate of 2.8% between 1982 and 1984, and
2.0% between 1985 and 1987, yielded similar results as those of the
aggregation technique, and indicated that demand would grow at an average rate
of 5.0% p.a. between 1982 and 1990, and 3.6% from 1991 onwards (Annex 2.6).
EDP has formulated its core expansion program to year 1990 on the basis of the
(B) forecast. EDP's forecast was reviewed and found reasonable.
Organization
2.12     EDP is managed by a General Council and a Board of Directors
supported by central staff departments for planning, engineering, finance,
economics, personnel, organization, legal, etc. The Board of Directors
prepares the plans of activity and budgets which have to be approved by the
General Council before they are submitted for final approval to the Government.
2.13     Operations are conducted through six decentralized directorates, one
for generation and transmission, one for equipment and four for distribution.
The managers of these directorates form the Management Committee which
controls and coordinates operations (Annex 2.7). EDP is an extremely well
managed entity and changes, when necessary, are effected smoothly and
painlessly.
Manpower and Training
2.14     Upon integration with EDP, the staff of each company is transferred
to EDP. At the end of 1981, the corporation's work force amounted to 18,459,
of which 908 were higher level staff with University degrees, 8,954
technicians, 6,612 administrative staff, 1,404 unskilled labor and 581 various
staff on fixed term appointment.
2.15     The integration of staff with a wide variety of salary scales and
conditions of employment posed a particular problem for EDP during its early
years. For this purpose, a study was undertaken and a Labor Contract unifying
a considerable collection of rights and privileges, and providing medical,
pharmaceutical and social services was negotiated with the unions representing
EDP's work force, and approved by the Government in 1978. In addition,
standardized designs and uniform working procedures have been introduced.

2.16     To meet the requirements of specific training, EDP is currently
operating four regional training centers and studying the installation of a
central one. The training centers provide basic training, specialized
courses, and courses on safety and first-aid. In addition, close cooperation
exists with other national companies, mainly in the supply of training
materials. The training program for the period 1979-1981 was fully
implemented. Courses offered in 1980 increased by 47% (in relation to 1979),
and registration increased by 51%. EDP's training program and facilities are
considered adequate to meet the corporation's needs.
Ill. THE PROJECT
General
3.01     The Project consists of a three-year (1983-1985) time slice of EDP's
1982-1986 investment program (Annex 3.1). The purpose of the program is to
proviae electrical power to meet the forecast growth in demand at least cost
while maintaining the required reliability of the system. The Project
includes facilities under construction in January 1983 or to be started prior
to the end of 1985, and involves the expansion of generation facilities, the
extension, reinforcement and rehabilitation of both transmission and
distribution systems, the supply of site construction equipment and other
miscellaneous works. The estimated cost (1983-1985), including physical and
price contingencies, and interest during construction amounts to US$2,732
million, of which US$948 million would be in foreign exchange. The Project
constitutes an integral part of EDP's development program, which was reviewed
by the Bank and was found to represent the least cost alternative for meeting
EDP's needs.
Generation
3.02     Expansion of the generating facilities involves:
(i)  construction of the hydro plants (Aguieira, Raiva, Pocinho, Belver
VI, Crestuma, Vilarinho das Furnas II, Torrao, and Alto Lindoso)
which would add 1,459 MW to the system and would generate about 2,335
GWh;
(ii)  completion of the (2x250 MW) oil-fired thermal plant under
construction at Setubal which would generate 3,300 GWh;
(iii)  construction of the (2x300 MW) coal-fired thermal plant at Sines
which would generate 4,000 GWh; and
(iv)  installation of two combustion turbines (2x83 MW) at the existing
thermal plant at Tunes.
The total base cost of the generation program that would be implemented
between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1985, is estimated at US$696
million, of which about US$288 million would be in foreign exchange.



- 14 -
Transmission
3.03     Expansion and reinforcement of the transmission system involves the
construction of 564 km of lines and the installation of 2,328 MVA transformer
capacity. The total base cost (1983-1985) is estimated at US$103 million, of
which about US$35 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed program
is the least cost solution for the transmission of the additional power to be
generated by the new generating plants which would come on stream by 1985,
while reducing the present 3.8% transmission losses to about 3.4%.  Details
are found in Annex 3.2.
Distribution and Other Works
3.04     The program for the distribution system (expansion, reinforcement and
rehabilitation) involves:
(i)  the construction of 12,525 km of MV and LV lines, and the
installation of 2,360 MVA transformer capacity;
(ii)  the provision of 315,000 new service drops for LV customers, and
installation of 340,000 LV circuit breakers; and
(iii)  the expansion of the ripple control system.
Distribution systems which have already been transferred or will be
transferred by 1984 to EDP from municipal undertakings would be
rehabilitated. The total base cost of the distribution program (1983-1985) is
estimated at US$325 million, of which about US$116 million would be in foreign
cost. Details are found in Annex 3.2.
3.05     Miscellaneous works involve the expansion of testing and measurement
laboratory, purchase of computer hardware, a study for upgrading the existing
computerized accounting system (para. 4.15), a study for the identification of
possible sites for the construction of a nuclear plant, etc. The total base
cost (1983-1985) of these works and services is estimated at US$45 million, of
which about US$14 million would be in foreign cost. The above studies would
be implemented over two years (1983 and 1984) on lump sum contracts estimated
at US$2.2 million and US$1.0 million respectively; the foreign exchange
component would be about US$2.1 million and US$0.6 million, and the local
component us$o.1 million and US$0.4 million respectively. Terms of reference
for these studies have been cleared by the mission during appraisal and the
contracts are currently being negotiated.

Estimates for equipment and works are based on end-1982 international and
local prices for works of a similar nature that are currently under
construction. A physical contingency of 25% was applied to the hydro, and 15%
to the thermal plants. Lower physical contingencies (10%) were assumed for
the transmission and distribution cost estimates due to the continuous nature
of these works.  Price contingencies of 20% for 1983, 18% for 1984 and 16% for
1985 were applied to local costs, and 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and 7% for
1985 were applied to foreign costs.
3.07      the hydro plants included in the Project are peaking plants.  The
size of units installed in these plants has been determined with a view to
optimizing the cost-benefit ratio by simulating hydrological conditions over a
30-year cycle. In deriving its least cost expansion program, EDP has made a
cost-benefit comparison between the hydro system and a comparable system
consisting of a base load thermal plant, and pump storage and combustion
turbine peaking plants. 1/ On the basis of this analysis EDP is estimating
that the cost per kW of hydro capacity installed lies within the range of
US$2,200 to US$2,700.  For the thermal power plant (coal) with 300 MW units
the cost per kW installed is US$1,420.  Cost of single circuit transmission
lines range from about US$130,000/km for 400 kV to US$90,000/km for 150-kV
lines. These capital cost estimates are reasonable.
Financing
3.08      Tne proposed loan of US$126.4 million equivalent would cover about
13% of the foreign exchange cost of EDP's (1983-1985) program (including
interest during construction). The remaining costs in foreign exchange would
be met by the European Investment Bank (EIB), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW), Export Credits, and other loans.  Financing of this program is not yet
complete and it is clearly not feasible to have at this stage a financing plan
with firm commitments for an investment of this magnitude over this period. A
tentative financing plan is, however, given in para 4.11. The loan would be
made to EDP.
Planning, Engineering and Supervision
3.09     Altnough EDP itself is a relatively new corporation, its staff have
been working in the sector for a considerable time with the utilities which
were merged to form EDP. Thus EDP's staff are well qualified with extensive
experience in power system operation. The Planning Department is using
successfully modern computer models to prepare long-term development studies
(up to year 2010), and medium-term investment programs which are revised once
a year using sound methods and procedures for determining the least cost
development programs. EDP's engineering staff are involved in the projects
from the stage of preliminary design up to commissioning of the facilities.
Detailed engineering designs associated with the Project facilities excluding
distribution works to be undertaken in 1984 and 1985, and most bidding
1/ EDP formulates its least cost expansion program by using iteratively the

documents are ready. 1/ Invitation for civil works prequalification and the
general procurement notice were published in October 1981 according to the
Bank Group guidelines for procurement. Since EDP continued the procurement
process although processing of our loan was delayed, goods amounting to about
35% of the proposed loan have already been tendered under ICB. Construction
supervision is conducted by qualified teams who live in accommodation provided
by EDP at the Project site. EDP's arrangements for planning, engineering and
supervision are satisfactory.
Procurement
3.10     Contracts for equipment and civil works to be financed by the Bank
woula be let by international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank
Group guidelines for procurement. A preference of 15% of the CIF bid price or
applicable duties, whichever is lesser, would be granted to Portuguese
manufacturers of equipment who participate. A list of goods and their
estimated costs suitable for procurement in accordance with the Bank Group
guidelines for procurement and eligible for Bank financing, has been agreed
(Annex 3.3). Except for civil works associated with the hydro plants of Alto
Lindoso and Torrao, components against which the Bank would disburse would be
implemented within three years. Bidding and contract awards for a
considerable amount of equipment and materials would be completed by mid-1983,
while contract awards and mobilization of contractors for civil works
associated with Alto Lindoso and Torrao would take place in 1984. Details of
the implementation schedule are given in Annex 3.6.
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing
3.11     As already mentioned earlier (para. 3.09) EDP continued the
procurement process in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines for
procurement, although processing of our loan was delayed. Thus, most tender
documents and some bid evaluation reports have already been reviewed by the
Bank. It is therefore likely that a considerable number of contracts
associated with the supply of site construction equipment, studies, and some
transmission and distribution equipment would be awarded prior to Board
presentation.
3.12     Award of the above-mentioned contracts, and the fact that the list of
Project components suitable for Bank financing includes the tail end of civil
works and bulb units associated with the construction of the Crestuma hydro
plant (partly financed under Loan 1301-PO), it is proposed to reimburse EDP in
an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of US$5.0 million, for
payments made after July 1, 1982, towards items financed under this loan.
Disbursement
3.13     Disbursement from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be
made for:
(i) 75% of the total expenditures, up to a maximum of US$56.4 million,
for civil works associated with the Alto Lindoso, Torrao and Crestuma
hydroelectric plants;
1/ EDP agreed to have the design of the dams reviewed by a separate
independent panel of experts (see para. 3.18).



- 19 -
(ii)  100% of the foreign expenditure or 100% of ex-factory costs of goods
manufactured in Portugal for the Bulb Units of Crestuma hydro plant;
(iii)  100% of the foreign expenditures associated with the purchase of site
construction equipment listed in Annex 3.3, or 100% of the ex-factory
cost (excluding local taxes) of locally-produced equipment;
(iv)  100I   of the foreign expenditures of the purchase of transmission and
distribution equipment listed in Annex 3.3, or 100% of the ex-factory
cost (excluding local taxes) of locally-produced equipment;
(v) 100% of tne foreign expenditure for testing and measuring equipment,
computer hardware and software, nuclear plant site study, and study
for improving the computerized accounting system; and
(vi) interest and other charges on the loan incurred before November 14,
1986.
Tne expected disbursement schedule of the proposed loan and the allocation of
loan proceeds are shown in Annex 3.4.
3.14     The historical Bank wide sectoral disbursement profile, as well as
the disbursement profiles of the previous (Loan 1301-PO) and proposed loan to
EDP are shown in Annex 3.5. Compared to the sectoral profile, disbursement of
the previous loan started late due to procurement related problems, but gained
momentum a year later. In deriving the disbursement schedule of the proposed
loan, the following factors have been taken into account:
(i) the observed delay in procurement and subsequent disbursement of
funds made available through Loan 1301-PO;
(ii) the initiation of site works of Alto Lindoso and Torrao; 1/
(iii) the stage of tendering process;
(iv) the required disbursement against the ongoing works at Crestuma; and
(v) the advance payment required at the time of contract awards.
Environmental Aspects
3.i5     The state Commission on Environment, on which all the technical
ministries are represented, is responsible for ensuring that environmental
factors are taken into account before projects, including power projects, are
approved. Construction of hydroelectric and conventional steam power plants
are subject to a strict licensing procedure which requires consideration of
environmental factors and use of appropriate emission control equipment before
construction is authorized. Transmission expansion will inevitably impinge on
visual amenity, but care is taken to minimize the effect by careful planning.
I/ At Alto Lindoso the access road is finished, the diversion tunnel is under
construction, and site preparation is underway. At Torrao the access road
is finished, diversion of the river was accomplished on August 1982, and
site preparation is underway (see Annex 3.7).



- 20 -
3.16     In addition to the Governmental measures mentioned above, EDP is very
conscious of the environmental impact and relocation issues created by its
projects. To resolve these problems in an equitable way and to minimize any
detrimental effects on the environment, EDP undertakes studies in two phases
before projects are implemented. In phase one, the area to be flooded is
divided into 2-kilometer sections and a detailed study is made of the effect
on various sectors--industry, agriculture, antiquities and historical
monuments, communications, flora and fauna etc. In phase two, the sectors to
be affected are examined individually in depth. Discussions are held with the
appropriate authorities and parties involved, and a report is prepared
recommending the necessary measures for each sector, and level of compensation
of each private party affected by the project. EDP also makes a determined
effort to maintain good public relations with the local population affected by
its projects by ensuring that whenever possible they have access to the social
amenities provided for the construction workers and operational staff. Phase
I of these studies has already been carried out at Alto Lindoso and Torrao,
and have been reviewed by Bank staff and found to be of a high standard. The
second phase studies are in hand and will be reviewed by the Bank on
completion.
3.17     The Portuguese and Spanish Governments have an agreement on the use
of international rivers. This agreement specifies the stretches of rivers
which will be developed by each country and which will be developed jointly,
and the legal procedures to be followed when remuneration and relocation of
private parties are involved. An office has already been set up in Spain
which, in conjunction with the Spanish authorities, will acquire the land in
Spain which will be inundated by the reservoir of Alto Lindoso. The office
which will deal with the Portuguese land to be inundated by the Torrao plant
has also been established. The environmental aspects of the Project have been
adequately treated and no problems are foreseen during implementation of the
Project.
Risks
3.18     The major physical risks facing the proposed Project are those
normally associated with the construction of hydroelectric plants. Although
EDP is using experienced staff in designing, inspecting and maintaining its
hydroelectric plants, and takes all necessary measures to reduce to the extent
possible the associated risks, EDP agreed to employ not later than May 1,
1983, a separate independent panel of experts, acceptable to the Bank, to:
(i) review the adequacy of the designs of the dams of Alto Lindoso and
Torrao plants; and
(ii) conduct periodic reviews during construction of the dams.
in addition, EDP agreed to furnish to the Bank, not later than June 30, 1984,
monitoring and inspection programs for the Alto Lindoso and Torrao dams; and
not later than one year before the completion of the construction of the dams,
furnish to the Bank a plan providing the specific measures to be taken to
implement the above-mentioned monitoring and inspection programs.



- 21 -
3.19     in tne past Project implementation has been somewhat delayed mostly
due to procurement related problems. During appraisal, special attention was
given to procurement issues to ensure that similar delays will not occur in
the future. On tne institutional side, the major risks are in respect of
EDP's financial performance which is affected by factors beyond the
corporation's control.  Provisions for adequate safeguards are included in the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
IV. FINANCE
Past Performance and Present Position
4.01     The frequent changes in the organization of the sector and the
consequential uncertainty have had a detrimental impact on the investment
decisions of both investor-owned and municipal companies. This had inhibited
the expansion of the electric system commensurate with the growth of demand.
When EDP was incorporated the situation was very uncertain. The staff it had
adopted, altnough experienced and qualified, were employed under conditions
and salary scales that varied considerably. The reserve margin of the
generating facilities was already low, and new additions under construction
were insufficient to meet the forecast demand. The transmission and
distribution systems were weak and overloaded, and power interruptions were
frequent. Tariffs varied considerably from region to region, and the
politically strong municipalities refused to conform to measures proposed by
the newly created EDP. To make things still worse, hydrological conditions in
the tirst year of EDP's existence hit a low level which normally occurs once
every 15 years. However, the young corporation lived up to the challenge
extremely well. Only in its financial objectives did EDP fall short of
expectations but here too, it would have substantially complied with the
revenue covenant agreed under Loan 1301-PO, if as so rarely happens, severe
drought conditions had not occurred in the three consecutive years 1980, 1981
and 1982.
4.02     To acnieve its financial goals, EDP proposed and Government approved
yearly tariff increases which in real terms represented an average increase of
6% per annum. Because of the presidential and general elections in 1981,
tariffs were increased only 20%; however, immediately after settling in,
Government approved a tariff increase of an average 35% (41% including fuel
adjustment charge) from January 1, 1982. Another increase of 22% (29%
including fuel adjustment charge) was introduced on January 3, 1983.
4.03     The revenue covenant under Loan 1301-PO requires that beginning with
1979, EDP finance 30% of its average construction requirements from internally
generated funds after payment of dividends to Government. 1/ The following
table gives the tariff increases introduced each year from 1978 and EDP's
financial performance under the covenant.

the electric utility only for the previous and current years.

4.04     It will be seen from the above that EDP achieved a 37% level of cash
generation in 1979 compared to the required 30%. However, despite the
significant tariff increases in 1979-1981 resulting in almost doubling of the
tariffs in this period, EDP achieved only a 15% level of cash generation in
1980 due to severe drought conditions forcing EDP to meet the demand with more
costly means (thermal plants and energy imports). In 1981 when the severe
drought continued, the position was much worse inasmuch as the internal cash
generation was minus 38%; the cash flow was not adequate to meet even the debt
service requirements. However, since the failure to achieve the agreed
self-financing level was due to circumstances beyond EDP's control and
occurred despite substantial tariff inreases, which were about the maximum
possible at the time, the Bank has accepted EDP's performance as adequate.  It
is estimated that if 1980 and 1981 had been average hydrological years, EDP's
internal cash generation would have been 38% and 23%, respectively,
representing a return on revalued assets of 12.4% in 1980 and 8.8% in 1981.
EDP's income statement and balance sheets as of December 31, 1976-1981 are
given in Annexes 4.1 and 4.2.
4.05     Such wide fluctuations in operating results arise because EDP's
tariffs are designed around average hydroelectric generation. Although EDP
introduced in its tariff structure a fuel adjustment clause in 1977, this
clause is designed to recover from consumers increases in the price of fuels
occurring between tariff revisions assuming average hydroelectric generation.
Therefore, in years of above average hydro generation the fuel adjustment
clause provides funds greater than those needed to meet the price increase of
fuels, while in years of below average hydro generation the funds are not
sufficient to cover the increased fuel bill. Additional fuel costs due to
drought are covered by a special fund "The Thermal Support Fund ".

Thermal Support Fund (TSF)
4.06      The TSF was established under Ministerial Order dated February 25,
1960; it was not a legal entity with financial autonomy, and was administered
through accounting records kept by the generation coompanies in accordance with
regulations approved by Ministerial Order.  The object of the TSF was to
accumulate funds drawn from revenues realized from the sale of electricity by
the hydroelectric companies during years of above average hydrological
conditions, and transfer funds as required to the thermal generation company
in years of drought to cover the cost of fuel used to generate and/or import
from abroad the incremental power needed to make up the generation deficits of
the hydro companies.  Transfers of funds in or out of the TSF were calculated
on the basis of average hydroelectric generation.  After EDP's creation (197o)
responsibility to administer the TSF was transferred to EDP, which has been
keeping consolidated accounts of its operations and the operations ot the
TSF.  Each year EDP calculates the difference between actual and average hydro
generation, and after approval of the Ministry of Industry and Eneregy, the
TSF is credited with the equivalent amount of fuel savings resulting in a year
of above average hycdro generation, and debited with the equivalent cost of
additional fuel consumed in years of drought.
4.07      While the TSF is planned to balance over a 30-year cycle (which is
the basis for computing average hydroelectric generation) , in fact it has been
in deficit in five out of the last six years (1976-1981) although in three of
the years (1977, 1978 and 1979) the TSF had surpluses stemming from its
operations. The following table illustrates the performance of the TSF since
EDP's creation:
-------- Esc. Million -----------------
1976      1977      1978      1979       1980     1981
Balance as of December 31
(deficit)                   (2,969)  (1,775)       (423)   1,097   (2,998) (21,450)
To meet its financial requirements, the corporation began borrowing in 1976 at
short-term  for the TSF.  The interest on the borrowings amounted to about
US$50 million in 1981. Clearly the method of operating the TSF did not yield
the desired results and EDP believed that the TSF had to be restructured.
Accordingly, EDP proposed to the Government a plan for the creation of an
autonomous legal entity which would operate as follows:
(i) under any hydrological conditions, EDP would be permitted to generate
revenues adequate to cover interest and repayment of principal ot
loans incurred on behalf of the TSF. In the event that taritf
increases necessary to achieve these f inancial targets are not
approved, the difference would be made up by the Government through
a subsidy to EDP; and



- 24 -
(ii) if in any year the TSF has an operating deficit which exceeds 157. of
the total amount of the revenues resulting from the sale of
electricity by EDP in the previous year, EDP would be authorized to
apply immediately a provisional 10X increase in tariffs until the
operating deficit is fully recovered.
The Government in reviewing EDP's proposal considered that under the present
political setting it was not possible to establish the TSF as a legal entity.
It has, therefore, decided to retain tne TSF within EDP but institute the
necessary amendments to the Ministerial Order establishing the TSF. Thus, the
Council of Ministers on January 11, 1983, approved a resolution, published in
the "Diario da Republica", which segregates the accounts of the TSF from those
of EDP, and empowers the Minister of Industry, Energy and Exports to approve a
tariff surcharge which would fully cover the deficit of the TbF within 5
years, whenever the accumulated deficit of the TSF amounts to 15% or more of
the total amount of revenues resulting from the sale of electricity by EDP in
the previous year.  In addition, the resolution provides a clear undertaking
by the Government to make available or cause to be made available loans to the
TSF, whenever the condition of the TSF so requires it.  These measures are
acceptable.
Accounts Receivable
4.08     Prior to CPE's formation in 1969, some municipalities including Porto
were suppliea by companies operating only hydroelectric plants. Consequently,
the rates charged to these municipalities were substantially lower than those
charged to other municipalities obtaining power from thermal plants. This
disparity in electricity rates became more and more pronounced in the course
of time following many rate increases in the beginning by CPE and then by EDP,
because initially many municipalities, especially Porto, chose not to pass on
the entire tariff increases to their customers and, since 1979, stopped
further tariff increases.  The retail tariffs approved by Government really
set only the upper limits for such tariffs within which the municipalities
were free to set their own tariffs.  The result was a wide diversification of
rates in Portugal. In some municipalities the present rate differential
between municipal tariffs and EDP's retail tariffs is small, while in others
it is very large.  For example, the retail tariffs charged by Porto for low
voltage consumers are only one-fourth of those charged by EDP, and less than
one-half of EDP's bulk supply rates. Consequently, the municipalities which
tollowed this practice were not able to pay EDP in full, and in 1979 stopped
payments altogether. To make matters worse, certain industrial consumers also
started defaulting on their payments. Thus EDP's accounts receivables
continued to grow, reaching an unacceptable level equivalent to nine and a
half months' sales as of December 31, 1981.  To cover the consequent shortage
of funds, EDP has been forced to borrow at a 22.5% rate of interest in order
to carry on its operations.  The following table illustrates the deterioration
in EDP's accounts receivable during the period 1979-1981.

4.09     About 70% of EDP's receivables are due from municipalities.  As of
December 31, 1981, overdue arrears from municipalities amounted to about
Escudos 19.5 billion (about US$300 million) and are steadily increasing. EDP
believes that positive measures to settle municipal arrears will have a
beneficial effect on collections from industrial consumers as well.  EDP,
being unable to enforce payment by disconnecting the supply to the
municipalities, finally stopped initiating any new projects in the municipal
areas until tne arrears are settled. To resolve the arrears issue and to
establish uniform terms and conditions under which power could be distributed,
the Government has introduced three Decree-Laws. The first Law No. 344-A/82,
introduced on September 1, 1982, stipulates that implementation by all power
distributors of the electricity tariffs set by the Government is mandatory,
while it makes provisions for the currently lagging tariffs to catch up with
the official levels by December 1, 1985 (See Annex 1.1). The second Law
No. 21/82, introduced on July 28, 1982, stipulates the manner in which
competent courts would be established for arbitrating disputes of claims
arising from the sales of electricity. This law, in combination with
Decree-Law No. 296/82 introduced on May 18, 1982 would give the right to the
Government to withhold funds from the regular budget transfers to the
municipalities and to use them to pay outstanding arrears to non-financial
public sector entities. This avenue would be used whenever the two contesting
parties fail to reach some other agreement to settle the matter. The third
Decree-Law No. 344-B/82 introduced on September 1, 1982 determines the terms
and conditions for the sales of electrical energy in the Portuguese mainland,
and provides various options for resolving municipal arrears. In principle, a
municipality has the right to distribute electricity in its domain within the
level of tariffs set by the Government. If the municipality so chooses, the
municipal assets would be transferred to EDP or to some other locally or
regionally based public enterprise for operation. In cases where assets are
transferred to EDP the transfer could be done either by:
(i) selling the assets to EDP; or



- 26 -
(ii)  entrusting the assets for operation to EDP on a concession contract
in return for which the municipality would receive a rent, the level
of which would be determined by the Ministries of Internal
Administration, and Industry, Energy and Exports. 1/
In cases where assets are transferred to some other locally or regionally
based public enterprise, the transfer can only take place on the basis of a
concession contract.
4.10      If assets are transferred to EDP and the municipality in question has
outstanding arrears due to EDP, these arrears would either be written off
against the value of assets transferred to EDP, or written off against past
due rent to the municipality (in the case where assets were transferred to EDP
in tne past and the Municipality opts for the concession alternative). In
eitner case, any balance due to the municipality would be paid over a
reasonable period of time to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. In cases
where municipalities opt not to transfer their assets to EDP, either by sale
or on a concession contract, or in cases where assets have been transferred to
EDP but their value or past due rent is not adequate to cover in full any
outstanding municipal arrears, all dues to EDP would have to be paid in full
within 60 days, unless some other arrangement has been agreed between EDP and
tte i4unicipality. If such an agreement cannot be reached, then the debt would
be paid from the proceeds of loans that would be made available to EDP from a
syndicate of local banks, with the municipalities concerned servicing the
loans.  These loans, if need be, would be guaranteed by EDP.  The new
Decree-Laws address the arrears issue satisfactorily. However, to ensure that
arrears do not increase in the future, EDP has agreed to ensure that its
accounts receivable after December 31, 1985 would at no time exceed the
equivalent of three months' sales. In addition, Government has agreed that it
would take all actions necessary to enable EDP to ensure that its accounts
receivable after December 31, 1985, would at no time exceed the equivalent of
tnree months' sales.
Financing Plan
4.il      The following table is a summary of EDP's sources and applications of
funds (including EDP's gas and steam heating operations) for the Project
period (1983-1985) assuming tariff increases which would increase EDP's
average revenue (Esc./kWh) by 48% in 1983, 25% in 1984, 25% in 1985 and 8% in
1986, all from January 1 of each year. 2/ Annex 4.3 gives the sources and
applications of funds for the period 1982-1986.
1/ This rent is estimated to be on the average about 5% of the value of low
voltage sales.
2/ The forecast tariff increases include the rate increase, the fuel
adjustment cnarge, and a surcharge for the recovery of the TSF.

4.12      EDP's net internal cash generation after debt service and dividend
payments to Government is estimated to be 23% of the total construction
requirements, including multipurpose projects and gas plant additions of about
US$92 million. The proposed loan is assumed to be for US$126.4 million
(including the front-end fee) at 10.97% (variable interest) for a term of 15
years, including a three-year grace period, and would meet about 13% of the
foreign cost requirements of EDP's (1983-1985) programs, including interest
during construction. The front-end fee applied to the proposed loan
(amounting to US$0.94 million) is assumed to be capitalized. After setting
off the proposed loan and loans of US$61.2 and US$10.0 from EIB and KfW which
are reasonably assured, the foreign exchange financing gap for implementing
tne 1983-1985 program is estimated to be US$690.6 million, which is expected
to be covered by export credits and other foreign loans. Based on EDP's past
experience of borrowing in foreign and local markets there is reasonable
assurance of EDP's ability to secure these funds.
4.13      Given the large investment involved, it is not feasible to have at
this stage a financing plan with firm commitments over the Project period
(1983-1985).  However, for an investment of this magnitude it is necessary for
the Bank to be satisfied that the financing plan for each year of the Project
would be arranged. The availability of financing with reasonable conditions
would be one of the key factors in determining the size of the annual
investment program, and during negotiations EDP submitted a tentative
financing plan for the year 1983 acceptable to the Bank. In addition, EDP
agreed to submit to the Bank:
(i)  by November 30, 1983 and 1984 an annual construction and investment
program and financing plan for the forthcoming year acceptable to the
Bank. The financing plan would include a program of proposed
borrowing activities aiming at providing by June 30 (a) firm
commitments from other sources of finance for not less than 50% of
the required borrowing for the year, and (b) identification of the
sources from which the balance of that year's funds would be
obtained; and
(ii)  by July 31 of each year, 1983 through 1985, an interim report on the
implementation of the construction and investment program and on the
status of the financing plan for the current fiscal year.
If the interim report indicates that adequate funds to complete that year's
construction program will not be available the Government would either: (i)
provide or cause to be provided the funds necessary for that year's program;
or (ii) cause EDP to scale down its investments in agreement with the Bank by
eliminating lower priority items not financed by the proposed loan. 1/
1/ EDP's investment program is large and diversified enough that, should
economic conditions slow down even further, or financing become more
restricted, EDP could reschedule without much disruption some of its
proposed investments to match the revised demand.

Future Performance
4.14      Estimated income statements and balance sheets for the years
1982-1986 are given in Annexes 4.1 and 4.2, and were prepared on the basis of
the Government's target which requires EDP to finance 30% of its average
construction requirements from internally generated funds. However, in light
of tne drought experienced in the last three years and their impact on EDP's
financial performance, the Bank decided to revise the financial covenant of
Loan 1301-PO as proposed in para. 4.18. The assumptions underlying the
financial statements are given in Annex 4.4. With the proposed tariff
increases and otner additional charges (fuel adjustment, surcharge for TSF),
EDP's internal cash generation, after debt service and transfers to the TSF,
is projected to cover about 23% of its construction program for the years
1983-1985; and EDP would achieve a rate of return on revalued assets of 0.1%
in 198Z, 9.2% in 1983, 9.2% in 1984, 11.0% in 1985, and 8.8% in 1986. Even
with tariff increases and imposition of other charges which would increase the
average revenue per kWh by as high as 48% in 1983 and 25% in 1984, EDP's cash
generation after transfers to the TSF would be about 20% in 1983 and 1984.
However, higher levels of cash generation are not feasible since they would
require unacceptably high tariff increases.
Accounting and Reporting Systems
4.15      Prior to 1976 the various companies that were merged to form EDP had
followed different financial and accounting systems and procedures. Loan
1301-PO required uniform financial and accounting system to be installed by
EDP not later than January 1, 1978. This was done in 1979, in conformity with
tne uniform accounting plan established by Government for all sectors.
Appropriate depreciation rates were also prescribed and brought into use by
EDP as required under Loan 1301-PO (see Annex 4.4 for details).   EDP's
accounting system and its financial records and accounts are satisfactory and
are used for planning purposes and decision making. However, because of the
work involved in unifying the accounts of EDP's constituent units, the
introduction of a new accounting system and the revaluation of assets, EDP's
accounting work was delayed in the past. This delay is still continuing and
EDP finalized its accounting statements for the year ended December 31, 1981
during October 1982. EDP plans to computerize detailed accounting records
beginning in 1985, which would help reduce the time required to close its
accounts.
Audit
4.16      Under Loan 1301-PO EDP is required to submit to the Bank its audited
financial statements for each year within four months after the close of the
year. However, because of the accounting delays mentioned in para. 4.15 its
audited financial statements were submitted to the Bank in the past about six
to eight months late. Because of the above problems and the consolidation of
accounts that would be required after the expected integration in 1983 and
1984 of municipal undertakings with EDP, it will not be possible for EDP to
close its accounts within four months after the end of fiscal years 1983 and
1984. The computerization of accounts is, however, expected to improve the
closing of accounts by 1985. In the past the accounts have been audited by an
internationally known UK firm of auditors; these arrangements are
satisfactory. The audit reports have disclosed a satisfactory state of



- 30 -
affairs. The existing audit covenant requiring that EDP shall have its
accounts audited by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank is repeated
in the proposed loan, except that the dates of submission are changed to not
later than 8 months after the end of the year for 1982, 7 months after the end
of the year for 1983, 6 months after the end of the year for 1984, and 5
months after the end of the year for 1985 and thereafter.
Debt Limitation Covenant
4.17      Loan 1301-PO requires EDP to obtain the Bank's agreement to incurring
any long-term debt if EDP's long-term debt, including the debt to be incurred,
woula exceed 1.5 times the equity capital provided by the Government and EDP's
surplus. This covenant, together with the financial covenant requiring the
acnievement of a 30% level of internal cash generation (para. 4.18), would
keep EDP's assumption of long-term debt within acceptable limits and ensure an
adequate cash flow for debt service and construction requirements. EDP has
agreed to the covenant being repeated in the proposed loan.
FinanciaL Covenant
4.18      Government and EDP agreed in the past that the 30% self-financing
level is a suitable objective for EDP because:
(i)  self-financing of this magnitude would reduce EDP's dependence on
scarce Government resources which could be better used for programs
in other sectors that are not revenue earning; and
(ii)  EDP's improved financial strength would allow it to borrow in the
financial markets especially in the international market to finance
its large investment program.
Both considerations would have even more validity in the future when EDP would
have to support a large investment program. Therefore, EDP has agreed to the
existing self-financing level of 30% being repeated in the proposed loan;
except that the level of cash generation in 1983 after transfers to or from
tne TSF, snould be not less than 10% of the average (mean of current and
preceding year) value of its investment in electric power facilities, and not
less than 20% in 1984, 25% in 1985, and 30% in 1986 and thereafter.  In
addition, Government has agreed that it would take all actions necessary to
enable EDP to achieve a level of cash generation of not less than 10% in 1983,
20o in 1984, 25% in 1985, and 30%  in 1986 and thereafter.
Insurance
4.19     The insurance policies of the various entities which were merged to
form EDP in July 1976 differed from each other and, therefore, under Loan
1301-PO, EDP was required to formulate and apply by July 1, 1977 to all of its
operational units a uniform insurance policy for each type of risk consistent
with public utility practices. In 1979 EDP implemented such a uniform
insurance policy. The insurance covers all normal risks such as fire, theft,
boiler explosion, damage to, and breakdown of, machinery, third party
insurance for automobiles, workmen's compensation for injuries on duty, etc.
For purposes of insurance, assets are revalued using indices established by
the Ministry of Finance. EDP's insurance practices are consistent with sound
public utility practices and are satisfactory.

4.20      A set of key indicators to monitor EDP's technical and financial
performance was agreed on under Loan 1301-PO and are repeated in the proposed
loan.  The key indicators and the reporting requirements agreed with EDP and
tne Government are given in Annex 4.6.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Market Growth
5.01      The proposed Project is a three year time slice (1983-1985) of EDP's
development program (1982-1986) to meet the forecast growth in demand at least
cost while maintaining the required reliability of the system. During the
period i976-1981 consumption of electrical energy (sales plus losses) and peak
demand have been increasing at an average annual rate of 7.2%. EDP derives
tne load forecast of its system by using various techniques, as described in
paras. 2.09-2.11. The Bank has reviewed EDP's demand projections (Annex 2.6)
and found them to be satisfactory. In planning the expansion of its system
EDP has adopted the low forecast (Scenario B) which projects that demand would
grow at an average annual rate of 5% during the period 1982-1990, and 3.6%
between 1990-2000.
The Least Cost Program
5.02     The prime justification for the Project is that it forms an integral
part of EDP's least cost program for meeting demand. This has been reviewed
and found satisfactory. On the basis of the (B) forecast and in order to meet
demand through 1992, under average hydrological conditions, EDP has to add to
its plant existing in 1986, an additional 1,050 MW. Since nuclear plants are
not foreseen to come on stream until after 1995, the model was restricted to
choosing the optimal plant mix from hydro, oil fired thermal, coal fired
thermal and combustion turbines. On this restriction the least cost program
calls for the installation of 450 MW of hydro and 600 MW of coal-fired thermal
plant.
5.03     One aspect in the development of the least cost program which was
subjected to extensive sensitivity analysis related to the alternatives of
coal or oil fired thermal plant. Under all likely cases coal fired plant was
shown to be the most cost effective and was included in the program.
Return on Investment
5.04      Since the Project is an integral part of EDP's 1982-1986 expansion
program, it is not possible to isolate the benefits attributable to the
Project. As a result, the economic rate of return (ERR) on the investment
program was calculated, and is taken as a proxy for the return on the Project.
The ERR on the Project is 10.3% under average hydrological conditions, and
9.5% under hydrological conditions 20% lower than the average conditions.
Computation of the ERR was based on measurable costs and benefits. The costs
include the capital expenditures required to complete construction of
facilities initiated between the period 1983 and 1988, fuel costs, and



- 32 -
operation and maintenance. The benefits encompass the incremental revenue
attributable to tne new facilities based on the projected average revenue per
kWn (expressed in real terms) which is taken as a proxy for the customers'
willingness to pay, the net fuel savings resulting from the displacement of
thermal plants by the new hydroelectric plants, and the net savings resulting
from the substitution of electricity imports with power generated by the new
facilities. The calculated rate of return reflects the strategy adopted by
the bank and agreed by the Government, where all necessary measures shall be
taken by the Government to enable EDP to gradually achieve a 30% net internal
cash generation. The most important measure for EDP to achieve the financial
target is the adjustment of tariffs to close the existing gap with the
economic cost of supply. To achieve this, the level of tariffs need to be
increased by 2% p.a. in real terms starting in 1983. If incremental revenue
is calculated on the basis of 1982 average revenue per kWh, instead of the
projected average revenue per kWh (expressed in real terms), the estimated ERR
of 10.3% and 9.5% falls to 6.8% and 5.8% respectively. Although the 10.3% ERR
on the Project compares favorably with the opportunity cost for capital of
about 10%, it understates the real return because it excludes the consumers'
surplus.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
b.01      Government will:
(i)   take all actions necessary to enable EDP to ensure that its accounts
receivable after December 31, 1985 would at no time exceed the
equivalent of three months' sales (para. 4.10);
(ii)   to the extent that other funds for the annual construction program
are not available, provide or cause to be provided the funds
necessary for that year's program, or cause EDP to scale down its
investments in agreement with the Bank by eliminating lower priority
items not financed by the proposed loan (para. 4.13); and
(iii)   take all actions necessary to enable EDP to achieve a level of cash
generation of not less that 10% of the average value of its
investment in electric power facilities in 1983, 20% in 1984, 25% in
1985 and 30% in 1986 and thereafter (para 4.18).
6.02      EDP will:
(i)   employ not later than May 1, 1983, a separate independent panel of
experts, acceptable to the Bank, to review the adequacy of the
design of the dams of Alto Lindoso and Torrao hydro plants, and
conduct periodic reviews during construction of both the dams;
(ii)   furnish to the Bank, not later than June 30, 1984, monitoring and
inspection programs for the Alto Lindoso and Torrao dams, and not
later than one year before the completion of the construction
furnish a plan providing the specific measures to be taken to meet
this obligation (para. 3.18);



- 33 -
(iii)   ensure that its accounts receivable after December 31, 1985 would at
no time exceed tne equivalent of three months' sales (para. 4.10);
(iv)   submit to the Bank by November 30, 1983 and 1984 an annual
construction and investment program, and a financing plan for the
following year which will include a program of proposed borrowing
activities aiming at providing by June 30 (a) firm commitments from
other sources of finance for not less than 50% of the required
borrowing for the year, and (b) identification of the sources from
which the balance of that year's funds would be obtained (para.
4.13);
(v)   submit to the Bank by July 31 of each year, 1983 through 1985, an
interim report on the implementation of the construction and
investment program and on the status of the financing plan for the
current fiscal year (para. 4.13);
(vi)   tne existing aucit covenant requiring EDP to have its accounts
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank is repeated
in tne proposed loan, except that the dates of submission of the
audited accounts and audit report will be not later than 8 months
after the end of the fiscal year for 1982, 7 months for 1983, 6
months tor 1984, and 5 months for 1985 and thereafter, after the end
of tne fiscal year (para. 4.16);
(vii)   the existing debt coverage covenant requiring EDP not to incur,
witnout the Bank's prior approval, any additional long-term debt if
the total long-term debt including the debt to be incurred exceeds
1.5 times the equity capital provided by the Government and EDP's
surplus, is repeated in the proposed loan (para. 4.17);
(viii)   the existing self-financing level of 30% is repeated in the proposed
loan, except that the level of cash generation in 1983, after
transfers to or from the TSF, will not be less than 10% of the
average value of its investment in electric power facilities, and
increase to 20% in 1984 to 25% in 1985, and to 30% from 1985 and
thereafter (para. 4.18); and
(ix)   the existing monitoring and reporting requirements are repeated in
the proposed loan (para. 4.20).
6.03      In view of the agreement on the matters set forth in this report,
the Project is suitable for a loan of US$126.4 million on standard variable
interest rate. There are no special conditions of loan effectiveness. The
loan is expected to become effective within 3 months of loan signing.

Status of Construction in October 1982
1. Crestuma Hydro Plant
Civil works on the left bank which include access road, the power
house and associated hydraulic circuit, fishlock and navigation lock,
transformer substation, and control building are nearing completion. Civil
works on the right bank are progressing satisfactorily and it is estimated
that they would be completed by December 1983. Construction of gates, bulb
units, transformers and switch gear is also progressing satisfactorily and
their installation is anticipated to take place on time to allow commissioning
of the first unit in 1984 and the remaining by 1985.
2. Alto Lindoso
The access road to the plant site has been completed and the
diversion tunnel is under construction. Geological investigation started on
January 1982 and up to present 380 drillings have been made. However, the
unfavorable results of the core drillings on the rock in which the hydraulic
circuit would be constructed raised doubts whether the initial design of the
tunnel, surge chamber, shafts and open air power house located at the
downstream end of the long headrace hydraulic circuit was technically
preferable and economically advantageous vis-a-vis an alternative design
involving an underground power house. At present, comparative studies of the
two alternatives (open air powerhouse or underground powerhouse) which differ
only in the hydraulic circuit and the power station (dam and power equipment
are the same for both alternatives) are in progress, and it is estimated that
a decision would be reached by early 1983.
3. Torrao
The access roads to the plant site and the diversion tunnel have been
completed, and in August 1982 diversion of the river was accomplished. Works
are progressing on schedule and up to present no changes in the original
design have been necessary.

Assumptions Underlying Financial Statements
A. Income Statements
General
EDP operates a gas distribution utility in Lisbon and also provides
some steam heating from its thermal generating plants; but as the revenues
related to the gas utility and the steam heating amount to less than 1% of the
total revenues, the amount is considered insignificant and is not separated
from other revenues. The expenses related to the operation of the gas and
steam heating utilities are estimated to be less than 1-1/2% of the total
operating expenses.
Electricity Sales              1982       1983       1984       1985      1986

i'ariffs
The report assumes implementation of average rate increases including
fuel adjustments and thermal support fund adjustments of the following:
41% effective January 1, 1982; effective January 1 and July 1 of each
year during 1983-1986 amounting to average increases of 48% in 1983,
25% in 1984, and 25% in 1985, and 8% in 1986.
Fuel Costs
Fuel oil costs were increased in January 1982 to reduce existing
subsidy of about 37% to about 6%. The forecasts assume that future increases
in fuel prices would be passed on to the consumers automatically through the
fuel adjustment clause. Average hydro years are assumed for 1983-1986.

Wages and Salaries
EDP would add to its staff all workers of municipalities integrated
with EDP. Wages and salaries would increase at about the same rate as the
estimated inflation of about 20% in 1983-1984, 18% in 1985, and 16% in 1986.
Depreciation
The income statements reflect the depreciation charges computed on a
straight-line basis in accordance with rates authorized by the Secretary of
6tate for Energy and Basic Industries. The rates of depreciation are:

Taxes
The taxation status of EDP has not yet been legally defined.
Provision for the estimated liability to taxation on profits has been computed
on a "global" basis of 40% being taken to represent taxable profits and 60% as
tax exempt. Tne percentages selected were based on a study of the division
between taxable and exempt profits earned by the merged companies from
i972-i976. Taxes have not been assessed by the Government in respect of
taxabLe profits earned from 1977 through 1982.

Balance Sheet
General
Tne asset values of tne gas utility and assets used for steam heating
utility are less than 1% of EDP's total assets in service, and therefore are
not snown separately.
Exchange Rates
The assumed exchange rates as of December 31 are as follows:
1982    86.33 Escudos/US$1.00
1983    94.09 Escudos/US$1.00
1984   102.59 Escudos/US$1.00
1985   111.76 Escudos/US$1.00
1986   120.18 Escudos/US$1.00
The average exchange rates assumed for various years are as follows:
1982    79.98 Escudos/US$1.00
1983    90.13 Escudos/US$1.00
1984    98.22 Escudos/US$1.00
1985   107.05 Escudos/US$1.00
1986   115.88 Escudos/US$1.00
Asset Values
EDP revalued assets in service as of 1979, based on values as of
December 31, 1978, but did not revalue assets during 1980-1982. The
projections for 1983-1986 assume annual revaluation based on local inflation
of 25X for 1982, 20% for 1983, 18% for 1984, 16% for 1985 and 14% for 1986;
and foreign inflation of 8% for 1982 and 1983, 7.5Z for 1984, 7% for 1985, and
b6/ for 1986.
thermal Support Fund
Ihe thermal support fund for financial purposes is a plan to
normalize tariffs on average hydrological conditions by reducing earnings in
years of above average hydro conditions and adding to earnings in years of
below average hydro conditions. The fund actually does not exist except as
balance sneet entries; however, because of the below average hydro conditions
in 1980/82 EDP borrowed funds on short term against the fund. The report
assumes that a 10% surcharge will be made effective in July 1983 to repay the
TSF deficit. For additional details refer to para 4.05.
Proposed Bank Loan
The proposed loan of US$126,400,000 is assumed to be at an interest
rate of 10.97% for a term of 15 years including a 3 year grace period; the
front-end fee of US$940,943 and interest during construction is assumed to be
capitalized.

Page 4 of 4
Integration of Municipalities
EDP assumes that 50% of the municipalities will integrate their
distribution systems into EDP's system. The asset values of the
municipalities would be revalued to the date of integration less the amount
financed by Government contributions, and the value would be offset against
the arrears owed to EDP by the municipalities. Any balance due to the
municipalities would be compensated by EDP within 5 years with the balances
earning a rate of interest equal to the rate of interest of domestic long-term
loans; any balance due to EDP would be settled with EDP by the municipalities
by borrowings from a syndicate of banks.  EDP assumes that all municipalities
would be paid a fee as a "concession fee" of about 5% of low voltage sales.
The municipalities that elect to retain the assets and give EDP the operating
concession would pay all arrears due to EDP by borrowing from the syndicate of
banks.
Taxes
See Income Statement - "Taxes" for legal status.
Long-Term Debt
EDP's financing plan for 1983-1986 has not yet been firmly
established; long-term debt for the 1983-1986 projections is assumed to
average 15 years with three years' grace at an average interest rate of 15%
for 1982, 12% for 1983, 11% for 1984-1985, and 10% for 1986. Local borrowing
is estimated to have interest rates of 26% for 1982, 23% for 1983, 22% for
1984-1985 and 19% for 1986. Added to the long-term debt is a provision for
unrealized exchange losses which would arise when outstanding foreign currency
loans are translated into escudos at year end rates of exchange. The
provision for exchange losses are computed and added to the long-term debt as
follows: 1982 - Esc. 26,185 million, 1983 - Esc. 33,305 million,
1984 - Esc. 43,645 million, 1985 - Esc. 50,380 million, and 1986 - Esc. 60,370
million.
Current Liabilities
Short-term borrowing as of December 31, 1980 include Esc. 1,120
million owed by the Government Decree-Law No. 300 of 1980, requires that EDP
be remunerated for the Government's capital contribution towards the
construction program. Government's contribution totalled Esc. 1,500 million
of which only Esc. 380 million were paid; the balance is covered by means of
short-term bank financing.

Justification of Project
Alternative Development Strategies
1.      By 1986 total installed capacity (existing and under construction)
would be 5,886 MW, comprising 2,987 MW hydro, and 2,899 MW thermal (2,565 MW
steam and 334 MV C.T). Firm hydro capacity, assuming 80% plant availability
would be 2,384 MW, and firm thermal capacity, assuming 76% availability of
steam plants commissioned prior to 1986, 10% of plants commissioned in 1986,
and 90% of C.T plants would be 2,070 MW. Therefore, the system's firm
capacity woule be 4,454 MW compared with forecast peak demand of 4,056 MW in
1986. During the same year the corresponding hydro generation assuming
average hydrological conditions would be 10,772 GWh and 6,447 GWh in a
critical dry year, while that for thermal generation would be up to 17,800
GWn. Tne required gross generation to meet the forecast requirements is
20,818 GWh, meaning that even if 1986 is a year of drought, EDP would be able
to meet tne forecast demand without imports of electricity from abroad.
2.      It is projected by the (B) forecast that peak demand in 1992 would be
J,250 MW, which would require the installation of 800 MW additional capacity.
The feasible technical options to meet this demand include the additions of
hydro, ano coal-fired thermal base plants.
