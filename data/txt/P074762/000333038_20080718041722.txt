F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC) is to assist the
Government in building its capacity to meet the governance and poverty reduction
objectives set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The International
Development Association (Association) will support the implementation of the PRSP
through a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) covering a broad range of
policies.




                                             ii

  The PSTAC supports the first PRSC and focuses on two of the seven pillars that
comprise the poverty reduction strategy, namely (i) build stronger institutions and
improve governance, and(ii)improve safety nets.

  Specifically, the PSTAC's development objectives are to:
  - Strengthen fiscal, financial and fiduciary management
  - Improve the coverage and efficiency of social safety nets
  - Develop institutional capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate and improve PRSP
implementation

decades, inadequate investment and negative growth led to an unsustainable debt
situation. To remedy its difficulties, the Government adopted an economic recovery
program in 1988. Its key tenets included: (i) trade and capital liberalization; (ii) removal
of price controls and subsidies; (iii) privatization of state activities and reduction; and (iv)
expanded social services. These helped to bring about a strong improvement as growth
averaged 7% during 1991-97 and inflation fell to single digits.

By 1998, however, the initial gains from the reforms appeared to have been exhausted.
Annual GDP growth declined to -1.7% in 1999 and public finances deteriorated, partly
due to external and domestic shocks and delays in the implementation of key structural
reforms. There were also labor strikes, outbreaks of violence, El Niño droughts and
lower commodity export prices.          These and the continuing emigration of skilled
personnel, impeded governance and economic management, and obstructed planned
reforms. The continued manifestations of these problems revealed the significant burden
of the country's strong ethnic rivalries which have dominated national politics. As a
result of these factors, Guyana remains a relatively fragile state.

Past public sector reform efforts aimed at institutional strengthening and streamlining
have made little progress. The public sector continued to suffer from weak financial
management, overlapping and inconsistent responsibilities, and excessively central
decision-making. At the same time, its wage bill has kept steadily growing. The
challenges existing in public sector management were highlighted in various assessments.
The IMF and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) completed
a comprehensive tax and customs diagnostic and were particularly concerned with tax
policy and the management of the Revenue Authority (GRA). The Bank's Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) identified the shortcomings of the 2002
Procurement Law and the need for strengthening central and regional tender boards. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) showed deficiencies in the
financial management systems. Addressing social safety nets was deemed essential as
reflected by the poverty indices and the prospects of more unemployment and dislocation
resulting from sector restructuring of some productive sectors. And there was evidence
of weak capacity for managing the government's development agenda.

Following the earlier government National Development Strategy, and under a HPIC
initiative, Guyana prepared its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2001. It
emphasized: (i) stimulating economic growth, (ii) strengthening governance, public
sector capacity and accountability, and (iii) improving the delivery of basic services. It
called for initiatives in: (i) broad-based, job-generating growth; (ii) environmental
protection; (iii) stronger institutions and better governance; (iv) human capital

investments, especially for basic education and health; (v) upgrading physical capital; (vi)
improved social safety nets; and (vii) interventions in regional poverty pockets.

Rationale for Bank Assistance.      The CAS approved in September 2002, called for
supporting the Government's PRSP through a series of closely spaced Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs).      These were to assist the Government in achieving the
benchmarks defined in the PRSP particularly those aimed at improving social services
and institutional upgrading. Related technical assistance was to attack key capacity
constraints through Public Sector Technical Assistance Credits (PSTACs). The PRSC in
conjunction with the PSTAC intended to address (i) the strengthening of governance,
public sector capacity and accountability, and (ii) the delivery of basic services including
social safety nets. Furthermore, PSTAC was to address these agenda items in close
coordination with the donor community and other development partners.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

PSTAC development objectives were to strengthen: (i) fiscal, financial and fiduciary
management; (ii) the coverage and efficiency of the social safety nets; and (iii)
institutional capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate and improve PRSP implementation.

The key PDO indicators were: (i) improved functioning of the Revenue Authority; (ii)
strengthening the procurement system; (iii) development of recommendations concerning
Executive branch discretionary limits and fiduciary oversight; (iv) integration of civil
service payroll and personnel management systems; (v) advancement of the national
cooperative bank's privatization; (vi) better management of the Government holding
company for commercial and industrial entities; (vii) more efficient social safety net
management; (viii) design of severance packages for restructured state industries' staffs;
and (ix) effective monitoring and evaluation processes for PRSP activities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
No revisions were made to the PDO

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project's primary target group effectively was the entire population of Guyana,
which was foreseen to benefit from the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy
and improved public sector performance. The latter was expected to be achieved by
expanding Government efficiency in fiscal, financial and fiduciary management. In
addition, through the projected strengthening of safety net programs for the poor, it was
envisaged that the Ministry of Labour Human Services and Social Security (MLHSSS)
would become better able to provide better services and expanded coverage. Secondary
beneficiaries were expected to include private sector entities through the collateral
improvement of the country's investment and commercial environment.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Strengthen fiscal, financial and fiduciary management. The objective
of this component was to improve the accountability, transparency and efficiency of
Guyana's public sector in its fiscal, financial and fiduciary management.

Sub-Component 1.1: Strengthen the Revenue Authority (GRA). This sub-component
was not defined in detail during appraisal. Instead, it was to be fleshed out later based on
agreements between the Government and the IMF. The plan foresaw the likelihood of
activities aimed at supporting:

(i)     The employment of consultants to help the Government manage the GRA, which
        had amalgamated the former Customs and Excise, as well as Inland Revenue
        Departments;
(ii)    The definition and implementation of an anti-corruption program;
(iii)   Improved tax and customs systems; and
(iv)    Implementation of a value added tax (VAT) system.

Sub-Component 1.2: Strengthen Procurement Administration. The objective of this sub-
component was to modernize the outdated public procurement system.               It targeted
revising the procurement law, rules and regulations (which were conditions for HIPC and
PRSC disbursements). It would support the:

(i)     Provision of advice on drafting new rules and regulations; printing and
        dissemination of a new law, and training Government officials in associated
        changes; and
(ii)    Establishment of a new National Procurement Tender Board and its Secretariat
        and systems, installing a management information system, training employees,
        and expanding public information on Government purchasing.

Sub-Component 1.3: Fiduciary Oversight. The objectives of this sub-component were to
reduce the excessive discretion in executive branch management and expand the
legislature's system of checks and balances. It would provide for studies aimed at:

(i)     Strengthening Parliament's fiduciary oversight. This was to be focused on the
        Parliamentary Sectoral Committee on Economic Services (PSCES) and its
        secretariat. These institutions, although authorized, were not yet effectively
        constituted. The planned studies were aimed at (a) developing their operational
        framework; (b) developing systems and procedures for their analyses and
        deliberations; and (c) identifying their training needs;
(ii)    Developing proposals on limiting discretionary powers of key line agencies and
        ministries.  The proposals were to be geared to evaluating their governance
        instruments and to recommending how their frameworks should be reformed; and
(iii)   Tightening disclosure requirements on public officials' assets. This study was to
        review the existing law and render its rules more effective. The plan focused on
        strengthening the Integrity Commission looking at the adequacy of the
        Commission's resources and its Government support.




                                               3

Sub-Component 1.4: Integrate Human Resources and Payroll Databases. The objectives
of this sub-component were to help improve civil service personnel management, and to
establish more reliable data for its incorporation into an integrated financial management
system. It was planned to provide consultants, hardware and software for helping to link
the Finance and Public Service Ministries payroll functions and personnel data.

Sub-Component 1.5: Privatization Support. The objective of this sub-component was to
build upon previous IDA-supported privatization of the state owned bank, under the
Financial and Private Sector Institutional Development Credit (FPID), which mainly
consisted of assisting the finalization of the sale of the National Cooperative Bank
(GNCB) and its properties. It was also intended to help the Government obtain greater
order in its National Industrial and Commercial Investments Limited (NICIL), the
holding company for government assets. The subcomponent would support: setting up a
computerized accounting system, ascertaining the status and value of the state's
properties, and improving their management.

Component 2: Improved coverage and efficiency of social safety nets. The objective
of this component was to identify weaknesses in social safety net programs for the poor
and otherwise needy members of the population, and to improve the service delivery
systems. It was also intended to examine possible assistance to those vulnerable groups
likely to be affected by planned public sector retrenchments.

Sub-Component 2.1. Strengthen Existing Social Safety Net Programs. The objective of
this sub-component was to help the Government's principal social safety net manager-
Ministry of Human Services, Labour and Social Security (MLHSSS) upgrade its
efficiency, coverage, and service targeting and distribution.

Sub-Component 2.2. Prepare Safety Net Options for Vulnerable Groups. The objective
of this sub-component was to prepare solutions for vulnerable groups that could be
affected by possible retrenchments from sugar and water sector restructurings.

Component 3: Institutional capacity to manage, monitor, and improve poverty
reduction and public sector governance operations. The objective of this component
was to support Government efforts to implement its PRSP strategy, and monitor and
evaluate their progress. Specifically, it aimed to improve the Government's capacity to
implement programs in these areas, with particular emphasis on generating and
disseminating reliable data, as well as to involve communities in monitoring PRSP
activities.

Sub-Component 3.1: Strengthened Bureau of Statistics (BOS). The aim of this sub-
component focused on upgrading the BOS' processes, systems and IT capabilities.
Moreover, this subcomponent was intended to strengthen BOS' managerial and
supervisory capacities, including assistance for the provision of modern equipment for
data management and help establish a BOS website. Training and support for a planned
national census and household budget surveys were also to be supported.

Sub-Component 3.2: Policy Coordination and Programme Management (PCPMU). This
sub-component was directed at establishing a central Government entity to help manage



                                             4

the PRSP and public sector reform activities, and provide advice on their implementation.
The PCPMU was also to be responsible for monitoring and evaluating PRSP activities
and the PSTAC itself.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no revisions of the Project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Project's original July 12, 2006 closing date was extended by one year to July 12,
2007. This was intended to enable the Government to consolidate initial advances made
in monitoring and evaluation, fiduciary oversight and social safety nets, and to implement
some studies' recommendations. The activities included an evaluation of the M&E
system and how to implement a systems approach. Additional time was needed to
complete the procurement component work plan and process the Household Survey,
including the continuation of essential BOS consultants.

The extension was also designed to permit the Government to expand the Project's
original scope so that it would encompass some initially unplanned activities, these
included the completion of a second Integrity Commission Study to advance reform of
that unit's anti-corruption agenda; the operational audit of the main social safety nets and
advancement of some of the activities identified in the Social Action Plan. This was
facilitated by changes in the PSTAC's funding plan, enabled by the availability of
alternative financing resources and significant gains in the SDR exchange rate.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

During preparation, the Bank team was confronted with a wide range of possible reform
objectives to support Government efforts to obtain higher levels of economic growth and
social development.      Moreover, the PRSP and PRSC had flagged pressing poverty
reduction requirements and identified a sizeable body of "priority" undertakings for
which the Government sought external funding. These comprised a more formidable
agenda than the Project could realistically tackle. IDA funds were also limited. This
resulted in a lengthy gestation process with considerable discussions on how best to
organize the operation.

Also, experience in Bank-funded projects in Guyana had clearly shown a need for setting
limited goals. Domestic public sector planning and implementation capabilities were
very thin, especially because of the narrow human resource base and the continuing
emigration of skilled Guyanese. Some agencies, notably the MLHSSS, were challenged
to carry out development tasks properly. This and the poor compensation of government
staff made dependence on consultants a necessity. Finally, vested interests and ethnic
inspired political pressure that translate into occasional strikes, parliamentary stalemate




                                              5

and security problems often undermined efforts to introduce governance and economic
reform.

As a result of the above factors, it appeared that the Government would be confronted
with a challenging situation in trying to properly implement the Project. On these and
related grounds, the QAG's entry review appropriately judged its risks to be "high" and
recommended special attention on the degree of government commitment and its
capabilities.

In order to address the inherent risks, the Bank team made special efforts to build into the
project's design good parameters for the proposed activities, and also mandated suitable
tools for their surveillance. The Bank maintained a local project management consultant
in the Georgetown Office from the onset for day-to-day monitoring and assistance. The
head of the Bank Resident Mission were brought into the team as well to help coordinate
activities.

Furthermore, the preparation team appropriately framed the PSTAC's components as
"seed money" geared to accomplishing broader goals than the Project itself could help
realize. This was aimed at enlisting support from other donors to roll out the PSTAC-
funded initiatives, as well as to try to spread the risks of the operation. The work
underlying project design was quite innovative and did indeed help the Government
obtain the envisaged collaborative funding. The appropriateness of this approach was
particularly noteworthy in the enhanced coordination between the Bank and the IDB (the
major external funding source) as well as the IMF. The resulting links that were fostered
between the Bank, these partners, and other donors (notably DFID) provided significant
support to the PSTAC's implementation and the parallel Poverty Reduction and Public
Management Operation (PRPMO)1 (see details in section 2.2).

The Government demonstrated positive interest and ownership in the Project during its
preparation.    It agreed to address policy, oversight, and administrative reforms in
essential fiduciary and fiscal agencies, and to undertake activities affecting tax policy and
tax and customs administration. It also agreed to fix the main responsibility for the
Project within the Office of the President on the assumption that a well placed central
body would provide and maintain suitable top level direction. But this arrangement
proved at times to be disadvantageous at times as evidenced in the implementation
problems, especially pertaining to the M&E component as described in Section 2.2.

Other features of the preparation work included the Government's involvement of some
8,000 citizens in PRSP consultations, which in turn led to defining the technical
assistance that would be needed to support its poverty agenda. Furthermore, the Bank
team met with Guyana's main opposition party to discuss Project design ­ a fact that may

have contributed later to the pivotal bipartisan backing on contentious Parliamentary
rules changes.


Institutional weakness and lack of ownership, however, adversely affected the execution
of some components. The potential difficulties of reforming the M&E system were badly
underestimated (as detailed in Section 2.2). Implementation of the proposed social safety
net system did not take place owing to inadequate support.

Also, the performance indicators were not well defined. Outcome benchmarks were too
general, e.g., "improved functioning of Revenue Authority to be defined", "strengthening
of new procurement structure", "increased efficiency in safety net management". They
dealt mostly with the outputs of components, e.g., "development of recommendations,
limiting discretionary powers, new procurement regulations".         It is true that these
followed logically from the Project's design. It consisted mainly of studies and diagnoses
aimed largely at stimulating new initiatives and keeping good existing ones alive, along
with a few instances of actions to complete some partially installed measures.
Furthermore, a basic characteristic of the Project, as a seed capital venture, was that the
attainment of several components' desirable outcomes depended on the programs of other
financial institutions2. It would have been better if the Project's results framework had
not repeated the PSTAC's outputs or reflected higher level outputs which went beyond
the operation's scope and objectives.

Overall, these shortcomings were of minor significance. Based on all the aforementioned
counts, this ICR agrees with the QAG's "overall endorsement of the project in its Quality
at Entry Review." The latter appropriately judged the operation to be well designed and
that it properly reflected a high risk and high return strategy.

2.2 Implementation

The Project was implemented with substantial complementary measures taken under the
parallel PRPMO (in line with the changes discussed below in the Bank's approach to
support Guyana).        The PSTAC's studies and other "first step" initiatives were
supplemented and advanced by the follow-on projects financed by other IFIs and donors.
A summary of these activities is displayed in the following table (see also Annex 2). It
gives an overview of the extent to which the Project's activities were successfully carried
out, as well as some of those which encountered difficulties. It also illustrates the
Project's success in actually exceeding some of the initial targets, and cites the instances
in which this was attributable to other institutions' contributions. This table is enlarged
on in Annex 2.




2 It bears noting that OPCS guidelines advise that: PDOs should focus on outcomes for
which the project reasonably can be held accountable, given the project's duration,
resources and approach. They also warn against specifying outcomes which depend on
the efforts of others.

3 In   2002 the Georgetown Sewerage and Water Commissioners (GS&WC) and the Guyana Water
Authority (GUYWA) merged to form Guyana Water Inc. (GWI). In January 2003 a performance-based
five-year management contract was awarded to an international private operator, the contract was fully
funded through a grant from the British government. The introduction of private sector participation
through a performance based management contract was considered "a key feature of the process".
However, In February 2007 the government terminated the management contract alleging that the company
failed to meet five out of the seven objectives in the contract.

Table 1 shows that PSTAC had positive overall impact. Bank intervention was timely
since the Government's reform efforts before the Project began was troubled by an
extremely complex domestic political situation. Thus, the subsequent successful PSTAC
implementation record represented a welcome change.

The improvement can be credited to a number of factors. One was the Bank and its
development partners' production of a wide range of analyses which added to and
updated the sector studies on which the PSTAC was founded. Yet another was the IMF's
2004 assessment and action plan which provided additional valuable material on
measures needed to improve public expenditures.            Furthermore, the Government
endorsed a group of 2003 Bank development policy proposals geared to obtaining more
rigorous public sector efficiency.

There was also an early recognition of past deficiencies and ensuing corrective actions
were adopted. By 2004, experience had shown that Guyana did not have the capacity to
implement the annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits proposed in the 2002 CAS.
This led to the Bank's shift to development policy operations, which were to be timed to
better match the Government's implementation capacity and political conditions. The
first, the PRPMO, was approved in March 2006. Significantly, it stressed reforms to
equip Guyana with better information and reporting systems, as well as to obtain greater
efficiency in uses of its limited public funds. These included better provisions for
strengthening the Government's monitoring and evaluation machinery than the PSTAC
plan had contemplated.       The PRPMO also had a good performance matrix and
monitoring arrangements. It was decided that the reforms identified for PRPMO support
had to be implemented prior to Board approval of its $9.6 million funding. Furthermore,
the conditionality of the Fund's then Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
strengthened incentives for Government compliance with several important macro
requirements, e.g., related to tax policy and administration reforms. This mitigated some
of the risks related to IDA credit operations, notably regarding Guyana's fiscal discipline.

Another important factor was the improvement across Guyana's political spectrum of
public appreciation of and backing for better poverty reduction and governance programs.
In 2005, the Government presented a draft of its proposed changes in the country's
poverty reduction strategy. The new Annual Progress Report (APR) document enhanced
the originally published strategy and its initial prominence.         It was extensively
disseminated in Guyana and widely discussed before it was considered by the Parliament.
These broadly confirmed the importance and directions of the envisaged reforms. They
also incidentally contributed to an improved dialogue among the main political parties on
the country's fiduciary oversight problems.

The Bank's own contributions to PSTAC's successful implementation included the
influences of its supervision activities. They involved considerable technical assistance
on many governance and other areas and close monitoring of the activities through a local
consultant based in the Bank Office in Guyana. The Project's mid-term review provided
helpful stock taking and identified opportunities for strategy changes and new activities.
All these usefully served to expand the effectiveness of the Government's PCPMU and
its measures to remedy various PRSP implementation problems.

On the other hand, the Project's execution was marred by some substantial problems.
The Government's commitment to achieving PSTAC's development objectives was
spotty, especially towards the end of the extended implementation period. It notably
failed to show sufficient will and decisiveness to establish a suitable M&E operation.
Both the new budget and integrated financial management instruments failed to provide
bases for system-based M&E activity. As neither one provided the requisite tracking
instruments, the necessary data on Government program expenditures were unavailable.
It thus proved impossible to gauge performance of priority programs. As a result, PRSP
reports were weak. On the institutional side, the Government resisted some system and
leadership changes and was not well disposed to acting to solve them in a timely manner.
The situation became so complicated that the donors collectively decided to try to
negotiate a reassignment of responsibilities for the M&E function. As a result of these
factors, the Project component encountered so much resistance that it never really
enabled M&E activity to get fully off the ground. However, this review also takes into
consideration that Bank review of other M&E systems demonstrate that implementation
of M&E systems tends to be a fairly long and complex process in different country
contexts.

Other institutional weaknesses were also costly. This especially pertained to the Human
Services Ministry, notably on the social safety net action. The latter was to be converted
into a full scale implementation measure but it was never launched during the project
extension period, as had been agreed.        Project-funded activities of the BOS and
procurement components were to some extent also slowed by organizational
inefficiencies.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Many monitoring indicators were well targeted as they reflected the key
recommendations of sector assessments of the Bank and other agencies. Some were
appropriately formulated to provide a good basis to track the status of the overall
operation. However, as noted, the indicators/benchmarks used during supervision were
concentrated mostly on monitoring advances of the Project's activities (i.e., outputs), not
progress towards attaining PDO outcomes. Despite this, there was effective performance
monitoring. Activity progress reports were updated yearly, and more frequently nearing
the Credit's closing date. The data collected had some substantial utility too. The
renewal of contracts of the head of the PIU within the PCPMU and some other staff were
tied to the fulfillment of specified performance benchmarks and monitored through the
detailed activity reports.




                                           11

Although project design also envisaged that the Government's new M&E unit would also
help to identify problems across government programs, as noted, the political and
technical problems encountered undermined the system's ability to retrieve adequate
information, and to provide very much useful feedback.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Government complied satisfactorily with Bank policy and procedural requirements.
The PCMPU staff, which remained stable for the duration of the project execution,
became quite skilled in its tasks. Project statements of expenditure and disbursement
requests were submitted in a timely manner, as were the audit reports (which were also
clean). No serious internal control issues arose to the level of reporting conditions except
minor ones that were ultimately properly addressed.

The PCMPU fulfilled its procurement function satisfactorily. The procurement of
consultant services and goods were conducted in compliance with the applicable Bank
guidelines and procedures.

2.5. Post-Completion-Operation/Next Phase

Transition Arrangements

The Government and the Bank agree on the need for a post-completion operation to
continue to underpin assistance financed by the Project and the PRPMO. This would be
based on the second PRSP which is now being prepared and progress in achieving
PSTAC and related goals. The Government has indicated its interest in deepening recent
reforms. Meanwhile, the Bank's staff is continuing the policy dialogue (an integrated
Fiduciary Assessment and Poverty Assessment are ongoing) and the monitoring and
supervision of the reform areas that were supported under the PSTAC and PRPMO. It is
also maintaining close contacts with the IDB and the IMF on the results of their
assistance. And the staff hired under the Project by the GRA and NPA have been made
permanent, which should provide useful continuity for follow up work. It is considered
likely therefore that a PSTAC II project will follow. In addition, there is already some
agreement that the Government's M&E Unit would be better placed within the Finance
Ministry.

Indicative ares for a follow-up operation might include the following:

·  Implementation of recommendations from the Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA)
   undertaken by WB, IDB and EU.
·  Guyana Revenue Authority. A review of the new tax system.
·  Procurement.       An upgrading of the MIS, implementation of e-procurement,
   implementation of the OECD's diagnostic indicators, a Quick Gains diagnostic and
   rationalization of procurement procedures, and strengthening of the new procurement
   secretariat.
·  Fiduciary Oversight. A second round of Standing Order reforms plus advancing the
   Integrity Commission reforms.
·  Bureau of Statistics. Its role and institutional strengthening continue to be an issue.



                                             12

·   Ministry of Labour and Human Services and Social Security. Systems upgrade and
    implementation of the Social Action Plan
·   M&E. A new operation could continue to implement the `system approach'. It might
    also include posting experts in key line ministries to mainstream statistical, strategic,
    budget formulation and execution, and M&E itself.

Recommended follow-up by the Bank. One key aspect will be to continue to work
closely with other donors, especially the IDB in order to jointly address key problems,
leverage IDB experience and lending on the central issues addressed by the PSTAC.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Rating: Satisfactory)

The overall relevance of PSTAC's objectives was high. They were highly relevant to the
development priorities of the time and continue to enjoy the same degree of importance at
present. As shown, the Project addressed the critical elements of the PRSP agenda
concerning stronger institutions and better governance. These still deserve the stature of
overriding priority goals, which are shared by other development partners for Guyana.

Moreover, the very problems which the PSTAC encountered reinforce its emphases on
upgrading the Government's capacities to carry out reform and development-oriented
activities in an effective manner. They also underscore the significance of continued
Government efforts to obtain very close collaboration with, and well linked support from,
its donor community. The PSTAC objectives and design bearing on this requirement
have no less relevance now than before.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Assisting the Government in expanding its capacity to meet the agreed governance
and poverty reduction objectives (Rating: Satisfactory)

The Project specifically aimed to bring about public sector institutional and efficiency
improvements, and better targeting and implementation of poverty remediation programs.
The extent to which the operation achieved these goals needs to be viewed in the context
of the following factors:

(a) The PSTAC was a very modest project. Its $4.8 million financing was intended to
     provide technical assistance for relatively small segments of a few components.
(b) IDA financing for these sub-components was partly and deliberately limited to
     launch initiatives in a comprehensive set of public sector reforms within a
     complicated and otherwise difficult country situation.
(c) The PSTAC's plan was open ended in order to create opportunities for other donors
     to address areas of interest--to which they responded.
PSTAC's activities mainly consisted of studies, small scale implementation of some
recommendations and the provision of short-term services over a three year period.
Hence, it is difficult to segregate and assess the direct links between the Project's outputs
and outcomes. This might be better gleaned from review of the Project's outputs and


                                             13

results in conjunction with those from complementary donor (and other Bank) activity.
These are set out in Annex 11.

Overall, PSTAC directly or through complementary Band and other donor activities
affected the following important outcomes:

 Improved Revenue Administration. The project financed the selection and hiring of
 two Revenue Commissioners. Their appointments fulfilled a condition for advancing
 IMF/CARTAC/IDB work in this area. The VAT and tax reforms were implemented
 over the following 2-3 years.

 Strengthened Procurement Framework. The project financed consultant services to
 help draft the required complementary legislation to implement the National
 Procurement Act and Regulations, as well as their ultimate dissemination. On the basis
 of such TA and related work, the Government adopted standard bidding documents,
 manuals, uniform operating procedures and evaluation criteria, established a modern
 information system for procurement tracking, management and publication of
 processes, set up and staffed national and regional tender boards and a secretariat. An
 initial phase of information disclosure has been implemented, and there is now a
 government website administered by the NPTA with limited information regarding
 tendering opportunities, procurement policy and guidelines, and information on
 contract award information easily accessible to end-users. This initiative is concurrent
 with the alignment of the procurement policies with e-Government policies. The
 Government also completed an annual audit of Government procurement. As a result,
 Guyana now has a legal and regulatory framework for procurement consistent with
 international standards and a competent Secretariat. Moreover, preliminary results
 from the Procurement System Assessment Report (PSAR) of 20074 indicate that
 Guyana's procurement system scored on average the highest for its legislative and
 regulatory framework. The same report indicates positive measures in terms of greater
 opportunities for suppliers, contractors, and consultants to compete for public contracts
 as well as in terms of quicker turnover of bids by the NPTA. All this constitutes a
 major change from the way in which procurement was being carried out.

 Strengthened Fiduciary Oversight. The project financed the launching of the first
 phase of an oversight strengthening program.       The parliamentary Oversight study
 resulted in changes to parliamentary Standing Orders. These have reformed the modus
 operandi of the Parliament, empowering it considerably, and giving the body a stronger
 hand in holding the Executive branch accountable.

 More Efficient Human Resources Management. A modern computerized personnel
 system integrating payroll and personnel records was installed. It allows for superior
 budgeting, real time tracking and reconciliation, planning and personnel management.



4The PSAR established a baseline based on the OECD/DAC­World Bank's
Methodology for Assessment of National Procurement Systems. The preparation of the
PSAR benefited from the analytical work produced during the execution of the project.



                                            14

  This would result in increased efficiency of payments to civil servants as budgets are
  now based on computerized data bases. The management of these data bases is being
  decentralized to ministries by IDB, which should provide additional efficiency at their
  levels.

  Improved Monitoring and Development of Indicators to Gauge Progress in the
  Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Implementation.               There were some
  monitoring and evaluation activities related to the PRSP. These included the: (i)
  issuance of the first semi-annual publication of executed current and capital public
  expenditures by sector and priority poverty-related programs; (ii) publication of a
  summary of the 2002 Census; (iii) launching of a Household Income and Expenditure
  Survey; and (iv) training for drill down and poverty map development. These will
  permit the Government to better identify individuals eligible for social safety nets, and
  to facilitate the prioritization of poverty reduction programs. The Household Survey
  has already provided the basis for a Bank Poverty Assessment.

It also bears noting that, while some programmed PSTAC sub-components were not fully
implemented, the Project actually exceeded its planned scope in a number of instances,
mainly in the social safety net and net services areas. These "extra" achievements are
detailed in the description of the Project's sub-component activities shown in Annex 2
(ref. "Additional sub-component" headings).

3.3 Efficiency

Technical assistance projects of the PSTAC's type are not generally subject to cost-
benefit or economic analyses. However, the Project could ultimately provide the
Government useful quantifiable incremental benefits. These would derive from the future
results of carrying out Government purchasing on a more standardized, commercial type
basis; mobilizing public revenues through the VAT; savings in the public sector wage bill
from more computerized civil service pay and pension systems; and comparable savings
from the increased Parliamentary scrunity of executive branch operations.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome (Rating: Satisfactory)

The Project's goals were largely achieved and some were substantially exceeded. Its
approach confirmed the merit of the objectives, design and advances set out in the PRSP
and the PRSC, and operationalized in this project. To be sure, its implementation plan
deviated from initial in some areas.       However, most of these departures were the
consequences of other donors' co-financing actions, which actually reflected the wisdom
of the Project's design as a source of "seed capital." Furthermore, the results of the other
donor financing which the Government obtained, suggests that the collective progress
achieved strengthened the prospects for sustainability of Guyana's desired public sector
reforms over the medium term.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                             15

The Project's direct effects on Guyana's poor and other vulnerable groups are considered
limited. And reflects its design decision. The operation's main purpose was to help the
Government equip the country with the basic information needed to develop an effective
strategy to remedy its poverty problems while improving its efficiency in using limited
public finances. This needed to be done first- before direct poverty reduction could be
successfully tackled - and for which much greater funding would be required.

While those "building block" steps were being initiated, there were some actions taken
that could contribute to more direct future poverty relief.         In conjunction with the
PRPMO, the studies carried out involving the MLHSSS constituted foundations for better
targeting of risky populations. These, the SSN law, the Social Action Plan and the labor
market activities were all poverty related, as is upgrading the systems for distributing
SSN payments. The Project and the PRPMO also supported the BOS to prepare for the
census, the household budget survey, and its own institutional strengthening. These
efforts facilitated the preparation of the Guyana Poverty Assessment.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project's effects on Guyana's institutional improvement were limited to the
identification of opportunities for mitigating the Government's capacity constraints, and
the development of policy changes and the implementation of actions for realizing
needed reforms. These were appropriately focused on the public sector's revenue
administration, procurement activities, fiduciary oversight and the civil service
management system. Hands-on training through the project as well as by Bank staff on
carrying out the design, implementation and processing of survey information also raised
the capacity of the BOS for future work in this area. Importantly, these efforts are paving
the way for future reform such as in the area of procurement. For example the MOF and
the NPTA have developed a plan for implementing the use of a single e-Procurement
portal to increase transparency and provide a single comprehensive and reliable
information portal with which to plan future procurement base on an analysis of the
country's system and monitor market trends.

Given the limited availability of funds and the enormity of the problems of the low
quality, poorly staffed, Government work force, the PSTAC's institutional impacts are
considered to be surprisingly good ­ but they have to be maintained and reinforced. The
institutional and management capacity framework to maintain the systems will need
follow up efforts to ensure sustainability of the successful outcomes. The main ones
were the aforementioned strengthening of the procurement framework, fiduciary
oversight function and measures to make civil service management more efficient (ref.
section. 3.2).

At the same time though, as discussed in section. 2.2, the Project was not successful in
developing an adequate M&E capability in the Government. This remains to be done and
it will likely involve strong coordination with the other development partners.

The high reliance on consultants in the government also means that at end of each project
there is a loss of institutional capacity. In this project, the fiduciary team in the PCPMU
that had been actually remained for the project duration and become quite skilled in its



                                              16

tasks was not integrated into a permanent role in the public service.           Follow-on
operations will need to again rebuild the institutional capacity for managing technical
assistance projects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The PSTAC increased public awareness and appreciation of the Government's reform
agenda, especially in the critical areas of procurement and fiduciary oversight.

None were carried out.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Rating: Significant)

The Project's appraisal reflected an appropriate appreciation of the uncertainties Guyana
confronted which had the potential to impair achievement of the desired development
objectives. These were important in view of Guyana's slippage from its reform gains up
to 1998 and its lackluster economic performance until 2005.             Among others, it
underscored the needs for ensuring adequate funding for the governance and public sector
efficiency and accountability advances, as well as social service improvements. These
helped to set out a modest-- but arguably adequate-- plan for meeting the foreseeable
risks.

As the Project's accomplishments indicate, there were some advances made towards
attaining the needed development outcomes. But the record shows that these were
relatively small steps towards the reduction of poverty and enhancement of public
management.      Neither, for that matter, do they ensure that those outcomes can be
expected to stay in place and to be maintained. Perhaps the best that can be concluded is
that some appropriate risk mitigation measures were applied under the Project and that, at
least at present, the Project's strides towards realization of the development outcomes
appear marginally sustainable (thanks to the PRPMO, IDB, IMF, other donors and the
proposed follow-on operations).

For the longer term, however, the fragility of Guyana's economy and its somewhat
tenuous growth capability, its high turnover of staff and reliance on consultants are
considered to still pose substantial risks to the full realization and maintenance of its
development objectives. For these reasons the risks are significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Rating: Satisfactory)

As discussed in section 2.1, the Bank did a good job in preparing and designing the
operation so as to meet the Government's development requirements and the strategy for
their fulfillment. It did so, moreover, in an effective scheme for close collaboration with
other major donors within the framework of the PRSP's implementation, in which the



                                              17

relatively small IDA participation leveraged larger volume of donor resources.
Regarding the arrangements for project implementation, the Bank team worked with its
Government counterparts in shaping an operating plan that included suitable provisions
to mobilize the required level of Government ownership taking QAG's views into
account. This was quite important in view of Guyana's past track record in public sector
improvements.

They project team also designed adequate fiduciary arrangements to deal with the high
risk environment.       The major ones concerned with country ownership and
implementation capacity but were appropriately recognized. The Project was structured
to take full advantage of the leverage to be provided by future Bank and IDB lending.
They kept the components were kept small, well defined, and spread across ministries
that had at least a modicum of absorptive capacity.          Corruption issues were to be
addressed by the Fiduciary Oversight component, the plans for rewriting of the
procurement law and reviving the procurement secretariat.

QAG's review appropriately judged the operation to be well designed and that it properly
reflected a high risk and high return strategy

A notable measure was the Bank's initiative in visiting members of the opposition party
during the Project's preparation and obtaining their views, which appeared to have paid
off later in the form of important bipartisan support for important changes.        The team
also developed a good working relationship with the PCPMU and other major donors,
mainly IDB prior to implementation.

The team was proactive during the design of the project. Its high quality, combined with
the work of the Resident Representative, contributed to the merit of the arrangements
installed. Before the Credit became effective, for example, Bank staff and consultants
worked with their counterparts in the preparation of service contract TORs and in
drafting the new Procurement Law.

(b) Quality of Supervision (Rating: Satisfactory)

Bank supervision largely consisted of detailed and intensive reviews of the Government's
actions. Output indicators were checked every six months, which provided an efficient
way to keep resources well aligned with targets. The mid-term review consisted of a visit
by the Bank project team leader, and an exchange of information on the status of the
performance benchmarks.       These flagged implementation problems and methods to
advance on remaining activities. It effectively led to useful agreement on the reallocation
of the Credit's remaining balance for funding new activities.

The links between the project and the PRSP, PRPMO and other development partners'
programs provided additional monitoring support. In this connection, furthermore, the
Bank team developed and maintained a useful instrument to track the planned and actual
contributions of other parties to the Project's activities. This provided a helpful picture of
the operating situation, as shown in Annex 11. These were supplemented moreover by
the fact that IDB officers often accompanied Bank supervision missions, and there were




                                             18

also good communications with the IDB team in Guyana. These strengthened the Bank's
dialogues with the Government on a variety of important issues.

In addition, the Bank kept a consultant in the Bank's Georgetown Office to provide
continuing day-to-day monitoring and assistance. The Resident Representative also took
on some coordinating activities for the Credit, as well as the PRPMO (whose task team
leader was in the field during the latter part of the project's implementation). The
supervision budget was adequate for the effort required.

But the Bank's failure to properly understand the difficulties of reforming M&E (as
detailed in Section 2.2) impeded timely and more forceful intervention in that area. To
its credit, though, some activities were added to the component in an attempt to
strengthen the activity. On the other hand, the problems encountered in getting some of
the new activities completed during the Credit's extension period suggests that the Bank
found it hard to maintain the momentum of the initiatives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance (Rating: Satisfactory )

This rating is based on the quality of its analytical work for the preparation and design of
the operation, and its energetic and dedicated supervision and technical assistance to see
it implemented in tandem with other donors, all under very difficult country conditions.


The parallel Bank activity to help the authorities overcome substantial macroeconomic
problems through HIPC and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative measures contributed
significantly as well.     IDA also provided extensive technical assistance for the
preparation and implementation of the PRPMO supported program.

5.2 Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

(a) Government Performance

For purposes of this evaluation, the Government and its implementing agency are not
segregated.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance (Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory)

The institutional arrangements underlying project implementation monitoring were for
the most part satisfactory. A PIU, placed under the supervision of the Head of the
PCPMU in the President's Office served as the principal agency responsible for
coordinating and overseeing all aspects of the operation. The Head of this Unit was also
the main counterpart in the preparation and supervision of the PRSC and PRPMO.

A reasonable level of Government commitment to the project objectives was sustained.
During preparation, the Government contributed constructively to the Bank's missions
and to the formulation of the reform agenda and its work in line with the PRSP.



                                             19

Uniquely in the country situation, the Government had facilitated the mobilization of
more then 8,000 people from various civil society groups for consultation in the process
of defining the PRSP. It also attempted to ensure satisfactory arrangements for project
implementation, even to seeing that they were in place prior to the starting date.

During the Project's implementation, the Government pursued its poverty reduction
strategy conscientiously and increased its budgetary outlays to the key sectors. It also
followed prudent macroeconomic policies and generally adequately supported associated
institutional, regulatory and governance changes, which were supportive.

But overall, the Government's direct performance was only moderately satisfactory.
There were the difficulties in implementing M&E reform, despite its imperative in the
PRSP. In addition, the Government's backing for the Project waned badly towards the
end of the extension period. Other disappointments related to some delays in BOS
activities, especially census and household budget survey processing and analysis and
difficulties in managing MLHSSS activities. Still others included the failures to carry out
the new activities agreed on for the Credit's extension period: e.g., a follow-up Integrity
Commission study and an operational audit of the Ministry of Human Services main
Social Safety Net programs. In both cases consultants were selected but neither study
was contracted owing to political resistance. Also, it was expected that some of the
elements of the Ministry's Social Action Plan, could be prepared or launched. Project
funds were also projected to implement a training program for the PCPMU based on a
needs assessment, but no training proposals were submitted by the government.

6. Lessons Learned

Thinly spread Bank resources can have significant impact if other donor resources
are leveraged timely and in appropriate areas.           The design of the Project was
criticized in its initial reviews for concerns that it had too many components with
inadequate funding. However, this format was chosen because it was decided to support
as many areas as possible whose interventions could possibly lead to good results. Given
the small amount of resources available, however, it was neither feasible nor advisable to
engage intensively in the issues targeted. Trying to do so would have magnified the
complexity of getting results. The Bank adopted instead a broader -- but thinner--
approach. This was effective in spreading the risk and targeting feasible reforms. The
"Christmas tree" approach thus proved successful because of donor collaboration. With a
small operation spread across numerous components and limited resources, it was very
important to have the IDB help to roll out what this Project began. This in fact happened
and it provided leverage and substantively improved results, in the form of progress from
studies to actions. The IDB had a larger portfolio and capacity to advance work in
Guyana. The sustained close interaction and good working relations with IDB improved
the performance of the operation.

Need for local consultants. Having a good local consultant in the Bank office was
crucial to working on the ground in Guyana. It was particularly helpful for understanding
the domestic culture and politics and for helping to move the agenda forward.




                                            20

Continuity of project fiduciary staff has positive outcomes for financial management
and procurement aspects of the project. Staff continuity facilitated the disbursement
of needed funds and procurement procedures, which otherwise become obstacles to
reaching project targets.

Flexibility for ensuing activities.       TALs characteristically produce studies and
recommendations, whose implementation are often left uncertain or long delayed by the
absence of follow-up resources.       In future operations, it might be useful to have
provisions for contingent funds for such purposes.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower prepared their own evaluation of the project implementation and results.
They also included references to their own performance and Bank's performance during
project implementation. This document is included in Annex 7.

Overall, the borrower's perception of project results is the same as the Bank's evaluation.
Their evaluation places emphasis on the fact that project was timely to support the launch
of new reform activities, to sustain the on-going work of other donors and in helping
realize new opportunities for additional financing for many of the important
recommendations and outputs coming out of the various studies.

Regarding the borrower and Bank's performance, the Borrower presents a very positive
evaluation of both. The evaluation recognizes that the collaboration with the Bank was
successful.

No further comments were provided by the Borrower after reviewing this ICR.

Programmed activities under this sub-component included streamlining GRA operations
and tax policy reform, contracting tax consultants, implementing an anti-corruption
programme, improving tax/customs administration, preparing for VAT implementation,
and improving IT capacity by procuring computer hardware and software.

A Commissioner General and a Deputy Commissioner General were recruited in 2003.
Their initial contract period was subsequently renewed for three months to sustain the
reforms started. These helped to implement the Tax Reform Action Plan (TRAP),
developed with the assistance from the IMF and CARTAC.

PSTAC's intervention was instrumental in paving the way for the long-term participation
of other donors in the reforms. The IDB's FFMP project provided US $7 M. to help
initiate the following at the GRA:

· Establishment of a new legal framework for modernization of customs
· Implementation of regulations for the presumptive income tax on the self-employed
· Establishment of a modern system for controlling and recording tax exemptions and
    publication of exemptions previously granted
· Implementation of a new unique Taxpayer Identification Numbering system
· Implementation of a new system of commercial invoicing controls
· Implementation of the VAT system
· Enhancement of GRA's information systems capacity for customs and domestic tax
    administration
· Implementation of Total Revenue Integrated Processing System

Most notable activities completed were: 1) Amendment of the Customs Act to provide
greater autonomy for human resource management; 2) Regulations produced for
implementation of the presumptive income tax on self employed; 3) Implementation of a



                                           23

new Taxpayer Identification Number; and; 4) Modernization of the recording and
controlling of tax exemptions; 5) Implementation of the VAT.

Procurement of IT equipment was completed by the first quarter of 2004. The initial
equipment list was substantially reduced due to more support from other donors than was
expected. The IDA-financed equipment was distributed to the various offices of the
Internal Revenue and the Customs and Trade Administration.

CARTAC and the IMF are projected to continue to provide assistance to the GRA.
Guyana has also submitted a proposal to the US Millennium Challenge Corporation to
support further tax and expenditure management.

The activities programmed under this component included:
· providing international expertise to assist in drafting rules and regulations of the new
    Procurement Act;
· purchasing office furniture and equipment for NPTA's Secretariat
· providing administrative tools for the NPTA's Secretariat
· establishing a management information system for NPTA's Secretariat
· procurement training of public employees
· providing procurement information for the public and develop plan for e-procurement
    systems

A consultant was contracted to prepare supporting Regulations for the new Procurement
Act. This was completed in late 2004 and the regulations adopted a few months later.

The Government appointed the 7 board members of the National Procurement and
Tender Administration. The Secretariat of the Board was established with staffing from
the defunct Central Tender Board Secretariat. However, the quality of the skills of the
staff was inadequate to facilitate capacity building and to move public procurement
reforms at the planned pace and desired levels. To ameliorate this problem, the NPTA,
identified seven positions in its Secretariat which were filled in March of 2006. This
brought the staff complement to the level of thirteen persons, establishing a critical
minimum operating level for efficient and effective procurement administration
functions.

In line with the capacity building efforts in the Secretariat, an initial set of general office
and IT equipment for the NPTA was installed in the second quarter of 2005. A second
set was approved by Cabinet and given the Bank's in the last quarter of 2006. This was
installed successfully providing the foundation for the planned establishment of an IT
based management information system (MIS). Software to serve the new MIS was
successfully installed in early 2007.

The MIS scheduled for development and implementation by end February 2006 was first
delayed substantially and subsequently installed during the second quarter of 2007 with
information gathering, data entry and full system testing. Training was provided during
the implementation period for both end user and technical staff. It is expected that this
will further serve the NPTA in bringing the daily management and monitoring operations,
(which were primarily manual processes) to a digital platform providing real time access
to data for improved decision making and management. Additionally, the system is
expected to provide sufficient information for post procurement analysis to facilitate
decision making for more efficient and effective long-term operations and programs.

In support of the design and implementation of this MIS, a Website was developed by the
IT staff of the NPTA Secretariat. The site is a major boost to the development of the MIS,
the E-procurement strategy and the NPTA's capacity to disseminate procurement
information.


                                             25

Procurement training under several themes and encompassing the NPTA as well as
Ministerial and Regional Procurement staff was carried out. Participants were trained in
general procurement policies and practices as well as the new Standard Bid Documents,
Procurement Manuals and Evaluation Reports. The NPTA is expected to continue
building procurement capacity at the Regional and District levels with similar training
seminars and workshops to be implemented with the support of its new staff.

The Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), Procurement Manuals and Evaluation Reports
were subsequently mandated for use across all procuring agencies. New administrative
procurement procedures are also being formulated and implemented to support the use of
these documents as well as the Laws and accompanying Regulations.             The NPTA
Secretariat is slated to continuously monitor the use and content of the Standard Bidding
Documents, Manuals and Evaluation Reports with the help of the new procedures to
assess performance, effectiveness and compliance.

A procurement audit was requested by the Bank following the acceptance and full
implementation of the administrative tools. This task falls within the mandate of the
Office of the Auditor General from whom a report is expected in 2008.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation has been asked to provide support for the next
steps of the procurement reform process through assistance for further training and
additional equipment.

                                but PSTAC funds were
                                insufficient for follow on.

Programmed activities included studies on: (i) strengthening Parliament's fiduciary
oversight; (ii) limiting executive discretionary powers; and (iii) disclosing public
officials' assets through the Integrity Commission. An inception report on the oversight
studies was completed in February 2005 and a final framework and guidelines report was
submitted were submitted to the Government on July 4, 2005. The report benefited from
wide ranging stakeholder consultation. In all, 59 recommendations were proposed of
which twenty dealt with improving Parliament oversight.

The Government accepted 30 of the proposed 59 recommendations and retained
consultants, to develop a fully costed action plan. This action plan was discussed with
stakeholders and subsequently finalized for prioritization and implementation. The
prioritization process was completed early in 2006 and implementation commenced.

Support for the implementation of the recommendations came from IDB-funded Fiscal
and Financial Management Project (FFMP) and, the Public Management Modernization
Project (PMMP).       Their assistance was in the areas of strengthening Parliament's
fiduciary oversight and, the limiting of Executive Discretionary Powers. Work has been
underway. The following are the expected results:
    · New Rules, Procedures, and Operational Policies for formulation and approval to
        enable the Economic Services Committee and Public Accounts Committee of
        Parliament to perform their oversight.
    · Training for Members of Parliament.
    · Development and implementation of a general institutional framework to classify
        Semi-autonomous Agencies (SAA) and Statutory Bodies (SB)
    · The revision and reclassification of SAAs and SBs from a sector perspective

It was anticipated that the PSTAC would continue the above progress to cover the third
part of the Action Plan's proposed activities, the Reform of the Integrity Commission
(modeled on Trinidad and Tobago's Integrity Commission.)          Accordingly, the new
Commission was expected to take on four roles: Prevention; Investigation; Enforcement;
and Enlistment of public support. Firms were invited to submit expressions of interest
and subsequently present full proposals for the services. Proposals were evaluated and a
firm was selected to provide the required services. The completion of this consultancy
was projected to set the stage for the reform process. However, the costs of the bids were
much more than anticipated and the shortfall in the funds available resulted in no contract
being signed.

The integration of the human resource and payroll systems was designed to facilitate the
upgrading of the quality and usefulness of their records with a view to establishing a
central repository for the Government's human resource information.

PSTAC supported Ministry consultants to undertake key activities. In particular, the staff
of the MISU was successful in facilitating the following:

    · Procurement of IT hardware and software for the integration of the HR/Payroll
        databases
    · Establishment of communication linkages between the Public Service Ministry
        (PSM), Ministry of Finance (MoF), Public Service Commission (PSC), and the
        Teaching Service Commission (TSC)
    · Revision of existing Budget, Payroll and Security Structures
    · Cleansing and validation of data integrity of HR/Payroll databases
    · Upgrade of equipment in MIS Unit at TSC



                                            28

   · Integration of TSC database into the payroll database, cleansing and verification
       of data integrity
   · Development of new custom reports for TSC
   · Development of interface with the new Budget Preparation and Reporting System
       and the creation of new relevant reports

In addition, training at end user levels were done on several occasions involving more
than twenty persons. Technical training was given in managing Smartstream HR/Payroll
database modules as well as working with web based reporting technologies. This was
geared to update the skills of the MISU team in implementing web based technologies for
reporting purposes.    The end result of should be better management through more
flexible, accurate, clear and timely reporting. Further, officers of the Teaching Service
Commission were given end user training in Smartstream after the integration of the
databases.

With the successful completion of the Payroll/HR integration, the Government with the
support of the IDB funded Public Management Modernization Project (PMMP)
commenced additional reforms in the following areas:

   · Procurement of additional IT hardware and software to set up PSM as an HRP
       back-up site to MOF
   · Management capacity of the Public Service Ministry improved and strengthened
       to enhance its competence to regulate and manage the public service system
   · Enhancement of the Personnel function to make use of available information in
       daily operations and for strategic decision making
   · Improved management efficiency, transparency and accountability in public
       sector institutions and systems of the Central Government
   · Public Service Rules revised and validated for more normative consistency and
       management flexibility
   · Performance Appraisal System for Permanent Secretaries and Heads of
       Departments implemented.
   · Connectivity for all Public Sector agencies

The completion of these additional reforms would permit some of the following:

   · Reorganization of the Job and Position Inventory to create a more streamlined
       representation of the Organization Chart/Inventory of authorized positions
   · Stronger control of employment procedures with revised job descriptions and
       organizational structures
   · Annual workforce plans
   · Trained HR officials and instructors and the provision of accompanying
       procedural manuals and guidelines
   · Revised and updated Public Service Rules
   · Real time access to data for more accurate and informed policy making decisions
   · The implementation of a Structured Performance Appraisal System
   · Better equipment to acquire, store and manage data for dissemination and
       improved decision making


                                            29

Furthermore, the integrated databases would allow the Budget Office to closely monitor
employment expenditure with live reports and real-time access to information on the
system. Controls have been put in place to ensure the Budget Office approves all salary
and employment changes of individual employees before they are entered into the
electronic system. As a result, the Budget Office is now able to reconcile figures on the
payroll with expenditure recorded on the budget system.
IDB's intervention via its PMMP builds on the foundation set by the PSTAC project to
continue to establish linkages to the new Budget Preparation and Reporting System
(BPRS) in the Ministry of Finance.

The primary objective of strengthening the capacity of the Privatization Unit to undertake
its program of privatization and state-owned enterprise restructuring was achieved. The
GNCB was sold to the National Bank of Industry and Commerce.

PSTAC also provided support for post-privatization activities of GNCB. All outstanding
employee issues have been cleared. The collection and disposal of bank loans is still
being monitored. The overall monitoring of GNCB post privatization is done by NICIL.

The valuation of properties and overall management and monitoring of state-owned
corporations/entities/properties, the leasing, sale or restructuring of unutilized
government properties is an ongoing of NICIL's responsibility. PSTAC provided support
to NICIL to facilitate the following:

    · Setting up of a National Asset Register
    · Ascertain the legal status of NICIL properties
    · Management and monitoring of state-owned corporations/entities
    · Wind up of entities into NICIL
    · Investigation and liquidation of non-functional state owned entities
    · Carrying out of recommended restructuring of state owned entities

The financial and other analysis on state owned entities and centralizing the financial
management of NICIL entities with the wind up entities into NICIL is ongoing. The
Privatization Unit and NICIL continue to be self sustaining entities.

At the time of project design PSTAC funding for a number of consultants was
contemplated. However, a funding shortfall that had been anticipated did not materialize
as a result of PSTAC's intervention and the support of other funding sources. Several of
the consultants who were to be procured were already undertaking key functions in the
GNCB Privatization process supported by NICIL's own resources. As a result, only the
Head of the Privatization Unit was procured. However, special care was taken to ensure
that the component's entire program was successfully completed despite the limited Bank
support. This extended a previous loan's work on GNCB.

Project activities included:
· A Labour Market Study to assess the adequacy of current retraining and employment
    services and provide guidance on an effective strategy for promoting the skills
    required for a restructured economy. The study was to assess the projected magnitude
    of the impact of restructuring in bauxite, sugar and the public sector and identified
    skills and occupations projected to grow, and skills gaps, absorptive capacity of
    growth industries, absorptive capacity for on-the-job training programs, retraining
    needs of displaced workers and their implications. Youth unemployment, gender
    issues and differences between the needs of urban and rural areas were of particular
    interest. The Study had three components:
    (i)     assessing the future demand for jobs in the primary affected retrenchment
            areas.
    (ii)    evaluating current placement and vocational and other training options
            available through MLHSSS/BIT and MoE; and
    (iii)   helping to identify a strategy to reform labor market activities, including
            linking employment services, one-stop shop approaches, and involvement of
            the private sector.
    The study was completed on October 15, 2004.

· The task of designing, implementing and review of a pilot Management Information
    System (MIS) to track MLHSSS programs and provide information on costs and
    beneficiary payments as input into management processes and to improve the ability
    to follow payments to individuals or track program costs in a systematic way, was
    completed in November 2006. The MIS also tracks program costs and helps to assess
    the efficiency and effectiveness of programs. A system administration manual was
    completed as well.



                                            33

· An evaluation of this system undertaken in 2006, while suggesting that the system
  was serving its initial purposes, recommended an upgrade to capture the other
  responsibilities under the Ministry's mandate. Report is currently under review.

· An ICT strategy for the Ministry was prepared. The Ministry has been expanding its
  Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure. Beginning with PSTAC's intervention for
  six workstations, the network now has twenty.

· A program targeting study was completed in March 2005. The study focused on old
  age pension and public assistance, looking at their adequacy, coverage and
  procedures. It also reviewed legislation underpinning the social security system and
  staffing levels and adequacy at the Department of Social Security and Citizens
  Services. The study provided a number of recommendations for significant changes
  to the Public Assistance Program and overhauling the old age pension program.

· In June 2005, the Government completed a social safety net, risk and vulnerability
  assessment. The study provided an analytical basis discussion of poverty,
  vulnerability and the adequacy of social safety net provision in Guyana. Specifically,
  the study (i) constructed a typology of vulnerable groups; (ii) constructed a profile of
  key risks and shocks and assessed their impact on the poor and the vulnerable groups;
  (iii) examined household and community risk mitigation and coping mechanisms; (iv)
  reviewed formal risk management and social protection interventions and assessed
  their effectiveness in reaching and protecting key vulnerable groups; and (v) provided
  recommendations on ways to improve the social protection and safety nets programs
  and policies.

· A Needs Assessment study was completed in 2006. The Government was not
  satisfied with the quality of the report and the consultant was subsequently asked to
  revise it.   The final report was subsequently submitted and cleared. The report
  focused on providing a comprehensive assessment of the skills mix in light of the
  increasing use of technology in the administration of programmes in the Ministry as
  well as an examination of the staffing and training needs of the Ministry. A strategy
  was defined for the development and retention of qualified staff, an appropriate skills
  mix of staff and the use of technology.

· A consultant was retained to provide legislative assessment of the Poor Relief Act
  (1903 as amended), and the Old Age Pension Act (1944 as amended). The analysis
  provided a brief survey of the two laws, identified their principal flaws and proposed
  changes. It also contains a brief outline of legislation proposed to replace the two
  Acts. The draft legislation is currently being reviewed by the Ministry for submission
  to Cabinet. Legislative Review of the Safety Net was completed in October 2005.

· A fully costed action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the
  above studies was completed in December 2005. The SAP had identified and
  prioritized the recommendations that came out of the Bank studies and other relevant
  documentation. To oversee the implementation of cross cutting actions, an Inter-
  Ministerial Committee (IC) was established in September 2005. This was later
 superseded by the Permanent Secretaries Committee to review the prioritization

    process at the conclusion of additional studies that were in progress. The SAP was
    finally agreed upon and prioritized for implementation during the last quarter of 2006.

· In conjunction with the prioritization of the Social Protection Action Plan the
    Government had approached the IDB for support in continuing the foundation work
    done under the PSTAC and to develop an operation to strengthen the Ministry of
    Human Services. It was agreed that the Ministry required more expertise, for which a
    facilitator and an assistant were contracted in the last quarter of 2006. These persons
    comprised the PEU charged with aiding the implementation process.

· General office and IT equipment was procured for the Ministry in 2004/2005 for
    equipping a small office to facilitate the arrival of consultants for the many studies to
    be undertaken. The office unit was also to serve as the nucleus for the establishment
    of the new MIS. Further office equipment was procured for the new PEU contracted
    to aid the Social Safety Net Action Plan Prioritization and Implementation during the
    last quarter of 2006. All the equipment implemented successfully. The Ministry now
    has fully functional, small networked facility for collecting, storing, sharing and
    disseminating information.

· A consultant was recruited during the last quarter of 2006 to provide non-technical
    Information Technology training to senior staff of the Ministry, for them to have a
    better understanding of the use of the Microsoft Office Suite package in addition to
    utilizing the technology more effectively and efficiently. This training is expected to
    continue the capacity building initiatives being undertaken by the Ministry to
    streamline its data management system.

This component was addressing some institutional weaknesses of the BOS in the areas of
human resources, skills development, and equipment, which seriously handicapped its
delivery of quality statistical information services. Through the PSTAC, the managerial
and supervisory capability of the BOS was strengthened with the recruitment of data
specialists as well as sponsoring the participation of senior managers in several seminars,
workshops and regional conferences abroad.

In addition, the procurement of goods for the institutional strengthening of BOS was
completed and IT and data security equipment and software were procured and installed
successfully.   Technical support and financial resources were also provided for the
analysis of census data.

Support staff in the form of Enumerators and Coders/Verifiers was contracted for a
Household Expenditure and Income Survey. The Survey was completed successfully
with some delay, attributable to the 2005 flood and access to remote districts. Delays
were further exacerbated by severe power issues. Nevertheless, the data gathered is in
the final stages of processing and is being analyzed as an input to the Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS) consultative process.

Various BOS capacity building exercises in the form of training and workshops were
targeted but its limited human resource capacity slowed this process. Some training was
however undertaken to facilitate the Census and Household Budget Survey exercises.

The successes in developing more robust statistical capacity are largely attributable to the
initial investments made by the PSTAC. For deepening the capacities of the BOS and the
social sector agencies, the IDB, UNDP and DFID are implementing a Social Statistics
and Policy Analysis project. Needs assessments have been completed for all the social
sector line ministries and agencies', about 20 statisticians have been recruited, and
training is being provided to statisticians, statistical officers, data entry operators and IT
staff.

The procurement of consultants for the PCPMU Secretariat was successfully completed
in the first quarter of 2003. These persons remained throughout the project life. The
Policy Unit had contracted only one individual from PSTAC funding. Alternative
assistance was utilized to support the unit for a brief period.

General office and Information Technology Equipment and Services were procured to
support the work of the PCPMU Secretariat and the staff of the Policy and M&E Units.

Within the M&E Unit, the Head and six M&E Officers were contracted in the second
quarter of 2004 under UNDP and IADB contracts. However, their funding for this
support was exhausted in 2006 and staff of the M&E Unit were reverted to PSTAC
funding. The M&E unit had suffered serious setbacks in previous years. It lacked a
comprehensive work program, a drill down monitoring system, and coordination of
sector monitoring and evaluation programs.

In recognition of these problems, the Government took several actions to improve
monitoring and evaluation. It obtained a PHRD Grant for a Monitoring and Evaluation
Institutional Assessment which was concluded in the first quarter of 2006. This study
essentially was to provide the basis for a long-term consultancy to offer institutional
support and capacity building in monitoring and evaluation.




                                             39

Following the assessment, a consultant was recruited in the latter half of 2006 and
commenced a series of training sessions within several key Ministries including Health,
Education, Housing and Water, and Agriculture. A training manual tailored to Guyana's
M&E needs was developed. The manual and other training materials are expected to be
further refined and utilized by those that were trained to train others, in the M&E field
and PRS cycle. The consultant also developed a systems based approach to M&E.

Complementing the work program developed by the M&E Institutional Assessment, the
terms of reference for developing a robust M&E systems approach were approved. The
Government subsequently contracted a consultant to begin this activity in September of
2006 in tandem with the consultant recruited to provide capacity building and training
services. The new system was delayed slightly to facilitate the procurement of required
hardware and software. Training and implementation of the system across ministries and
the M&E Unit at the PCPMU were scheduled for completion by end of 2007.

The procurement of equipment in support of the ongoing works of the M&E
strengthening and capacity building measures was carried out. The UNDP and UNICEF
have agreed to provide continued support for the work already undertaken, including the
procurement of further equipment for the Regional PRS Information Centres.

Background

The Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC) project was strategically aligned
to assist the Government of Guyana in building its capacity to meet the governance and
poverty reduction objectives as set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
In support of the implementation of the PRSP the International Development Association
(IDA) agreed to provide a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) covering
a broad range of policies. The PSTAC project was one such instrument aimed at
supporting the PRSCs and whose focus was on two of the seven pillars that comprise of
the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), ie. (1) build stronger institutions and improve
governance (2) improve safety nets.

The project's broadest objective like the PRSP and PRSC was to create suitable
conditions for the reduction of poverty and promote sustained growth. Specifically, the
project had three main focus areas. These were to:

    · Strengthen Fiscal, Financial and Fiduciary oversight management
    · Improve the coverage and efficiency of social safety nets
    · Develop institutional capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate and improve HIPC,
        PRSP, PRSC and PSTAC.

Individually, the development objectives of these three main focus areas were to: (a)
improve the accountability, transparency and efficiency of Guyana's public sector as
regards financial management, fiscal discipline and fiduciary arrangements; (b) complete
a targeted diagnostic of existing social safety net programs to present options for
institutional strengthening, and to identify possible solutions and interventions to address
problems in key programs; (c) support the Government's efforts to implement the
strategy embodied in the PRSP and monitor and evaluate progress by improving the
Government's capacity to: generate and disseminate reliable data; involve communities
in monitoring PRSP activities and impact; and build institutional capacity to undertake
Government monitoring, evaluation and implementation of the PRSP and PSTAC. These
objectives were not revised nor were the components.




                                             46

Throughout the PSTAC project design process the Government played a key role by
supporting technical missions by the Bank to diagnose components and define and reform
agendas and work programs. In conjunction, the activities associated with the HIPC,
PRSP and PRSC were also continuously carried out. The Government agreed to address
major policy, oversight and administrative reforms in essential fiduciary and fiscal
agencies and activities affecting tax policy and tax and customs administration and
procurement as well as agencies and parliamentary bodies within the Fiduciary Oversight
component of the project. This established from the outset a clear commitment and
willingness to take ownership on the part of the Government. Further, by establishing the
project execution unit within the Office of the President it was felt that project execution
would be swifter and the potential for achievement would be greater. Throughout the
project this was realized with the recruitment of key and competent staff.

The Bank also perceived that close supervision and technical support were going to be
required prior to and during project execution to mitigate communications and
implementation problems, and as such a technically qualified national was contracted out
of the Bank's local office. This proved to be extremely helpful in many instances during
start-up and the initial year of the project. However, mention should be made here that
the Bank should continue to recognize and safeguard against interference in Bank clients'
decision making processes as ownership of the project and its associated activities could
be severely challenged and even outwardly compromised. Note should also be made here
that at the same time collaboration with the Bank was open and friendly, supportive and
instructive and the Country Representatives and Task managers were extremely helpful
and patient. Ministries and other Government agencies and their officials associated with
the activities of PSTAC were visited regularly throughout the project life to discuss the
project and the implementation of their respective component activities.

(Note: A summary of the PSTAC components and their results which was presented by
the Borrower is contained in the Project's files).

Conclusion

In conclusion, PSTAC provided key and critical support to the Government through
strategic interventions ranging from provision of tangible benefits such as equipment to
capacity building for numerous Government staff. Further, PSTAC was able to provide
institutional strengthening to the Government in several key areas including Procurement,
Statistics, Social Safety Nets, Tax Administration, Financial Management and
Accountability (HR/Payroll), and Fiduciary Oversight. The project could not have been
more timely and supported the launch of new reform activities and sustained the ongoing
works of other donors. It also helped to realize new opportunities for additional financing
for many of the important recommendations and outputs coming out of the various
studies.

The Government is pleased to acknowledge at this juncture the hard work and dedication
of many Government officials, their staff, the project staff and consultants who played a
key role in achieving such a high level of success.

       Annex 11: PSTAC Monitoring Matrix

       The following table was designed to enable the Bank team, as well as the Government
       and other external financing agencies, to have a common uniform perspective of the
       PSTAC program and its links with related activities of other donors. It seeks to show, at
       the level of the PSTAC components, the actions which the different parties took
       regarding the preparation of those components and, ultimately, their implementation.
       The maintenance and updating of this data proved to be a useful monitoring technique.
