                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Community Development Fund Project has achieved all substantive aspects of the project targets, development objectives, and performance monitoring indicators set out in the
                         project document. To date, the number of projects approved by CDF has reached a total of 1091 subprojects of which 1085 completed and six subprojects stopped due to conflict in
                         Tolodi Locality. The completed education, health, water supply and village photovoltaic solar energy facilities have improved access to education, health and water supply services for
                         over two million people.
                         The following are some of the achievements of the project:
                         1.       Education-

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR10789



                         a.         Improved accessibility to basic education services as a result of rehabilitation, construction and provision of decks and school furniture to 594 primary schools (with 3010
                         classrooms) and 267 teachers’ houses. The completed schools are providing services to 182,740 (78,949 Girls and 103,791 boys) and the teachers residences built helped to
                         attract and retain teachers in remote areas. Given over 70 percent of the schools rehabilitated /built by CDF were teaching in temporary shelter built from local materials or under a
                         tree in some cases, schools with permanent building structures and essential facilities including desks, toilets, hand washing basin and fences represent significant improvements in

                         quality of education infrastructure. In addition, the improved school facilities contributed to the increased enrollment rates of children to primary schools.
                         b.         Over 110 schools and teachers residences are powered with photovoltaic solar energy which facilitates studying at night for students as well as allowing teachers to prepare
                         for their lesson plans which in turn improved quality of education.
                         2.         Health
                         a.         One hundred eight health facilities have been completed and are providing health services to 562,303 people (265,160 males and 297,144 females) in the four states
                         targeted by CDF. Sixty four of the health facilities have health workers residence which serves as an incentive to attract and retain health workers in remote and underserved areas;
                         and 69 health facilities are powered by photovoltaic solar system which facilitates availability of health services at night, refrigerated storage facilities for drugs and vaccines, and
                         solar lanterns for midwives in order to facilitate service delivery at night.
                         b.         To address the shortage of health workers CDF has supported the training of 273 midwives and contributed to the efforts of government to increase the availability of skilled
                         health workers in rural areas; the trainees were selected from the villages where CDF financed the construction or rehabilitation of health facilities and after their graduation returned
                         to their villages to serve the community.

                         3.        Village Photovoltaic solar energy
                         a.        CDF financed the installation of Photo voltaic (PV) solar systems in public facilities such as schools, health facilities, religious establishments and village streets has
                         improved the access and quality of basic social services in 171 communities. As indicated above under the education and health subprojects the installation of the PV solar system in
                         schools and teachers residences has improved the learning and teaching process. In addition, PV solar street lighting systems have contributed to the security of the villages, served
                         as gathering places for reading, created informal meeting places during Ramadan and sanctioned spaces to socialize with peers.
                         4.        Water Supply
                         a.        The completed 181 water supply subprojects are providing clean water to 596,734 people (Males: 284,170, Females: 298,463) and their animals, with easy access to the
                         village, which in turn reduce the burden on women and girls traveling long distances to fetch water. CDF supported communities own and manage the water supply scheme that has
                         been constructed or rehabilitated with the support of CDF. The Communities have also agreed with the State Water Corporation to share the revenue from the user fee that would be
                         collected by the community. Under this arrangement the revenue is shared 60:40 between the State Water Corporation and communities. The 40 % revenue retained by the
                         communities is used for minor maintenance and expansion of the scheme. This arrangement has dramatically increased the sustainability of the water supply systems owned by the
                         community.

                         5.         Capacity Building
                         Capacity building, monitoring and evaluation activities implemented are instrumental for the successful implementation of the CDF project and strengthening of capacity at community
                         and local government levels for planning, implementation, management and resource mobilization for development. Establishing and strengthening community structure was the main
                         activities financed by CDF throughout the project life. In addition, to complement the community structures the CDF project also supported the capacity building of local government
                         officials. Capacity building activities empowered communities and local government entities to take the leading role in identification and prioritization of their needs and
                         implementation of project activities. The following are some of the outcomes of the capacity building interventions:

                         (i)        Communities played leading role in identification and prioritization of their needs and implementation of project activities. The 616 communities befitted from CDF developed
                         community action Plan which outlined their needs and priorities. Seventy seven of the communities (i.e. 12%) implemented the project they identified through their community
                         committees using community contracting method;
                         (ii)       Communities also own and manage community infrastructure including water supply schemes and village solar power; mechanisms to generate funds through user fees and
                         community contributions and community management committees that manages the fund are put in place by the community to ensure effective O&M of community infrastructures;
                         (iii)      Communities mobilized local resources and contributed SDG 13. 9 million to the cost of projects.


                         This is the last ISR for the project. At present the project’s performance on reaching its development objectives and implementation progress are both rated satisfactory. The following
                         paragraphs summarize the status of the project in terms of relevance, achievement of project development objectives and efficiency, the three criteria by which the project will be
                         assessed in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

                         1. Relevance

                         The relevance of the project is rated as High.
Public Disclosure Copy




                         (i) Relevance of objectives. The project’s development objectives, both the original and revised versions, are highly relevant to the Government of Sudan’s efforts to address the
                         prevailing wide regional disparities in access to basic social services particularly education, health and water supply and sanitation services. These basic social services were
                         identified (by the joint assessment by the World Bank and the United Nations in 2005) as priority area for the reconstruction and development initiatives in the war affected and under
                         developed areas of Sudan. The CDF project has contributed to narrowing the gap on the geographic disparities that are the defining characteristic of access to basic services in North
                         Sudan, through expanding access to health, education and water in disadvantaged parts of the country.

                         (ii) Relevance of design. Program design was relevant given that CDF has been designed to align its implementation with regular government structure to avoid a complete parallel
                         structure which undermines government capacity and leaves a big gap upon project closing. To this effect, all the staff (except the Managers) at the Local Implementation unit are
                         government employees who will be going back to the local government planning unit with all the equipment and vehicles of the CDF Local Implementation Unit. The training of local
                         government leaders and the learning by doing which was promoted by CDF will facilitate the smooth transfer of all CDF resources, approaches and objectives to local government

                         (iii) Relevance of Implementation. As the project was implemented, it remained relevant to the country in general and the project areas in particular. The project provided badly
                         needed basic social infrastructure and empowered communities and local government putting them in charge of their own development, by driving the process and giving them
                         control over decisions and allocations of resources.

                         2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives
                         The achievement of the Project Development Objectives is rated as Substantial.
                         As of May 31, 2013, the CDF’s achievements include:
                         (i) Reaching 2,441,080 total beneficiaries across all project activities (against a target of 2,621,794);
                         (ii) Completing 3010 additional classrooms (against target of 2736) that provide access to primary education to 182,740 pupils (against target of 164,098 pupils). In addition the
                         project built 267 teachers houses against the target of 220
                         (iii) Completing 108 health facilities (against the target of 105); trained 275 Midwives (against the target of 235); providing services to 562300 people (against the target of 774050);


                         (iv) Completed 181 water supply schemes (against the target of 178) providing services to 596,730 against the target of 553860). All the water supply schemes are managed and
                         operated by the community with technical support from State Water Authority ;
                          (v) completed 171 installation of village solar energy to power community and social infrastructure in the villages against the target of 148;
                         (vi) empowered communities and local government to be the leading role in identification and prioritization of their needs and implementation of project activities.

                         3. Efficiency – The CDF project management has commissioned a study to review the cost of education, health and water supply subprojects implanted under the CDF project. The
                         study will compare the costs of CDF implemented subprojects with costs quality and implementation time of similar infrastructure implemented by the public sector. The

                         administrative cost for implementing the CDF was 13 percent of total project costs; the 13 percent administration cost is within the range of norms for CDD operations elsewhere. For
                         example, Araral and Holmemo (2007) noted administrative costs of 19 percent in the Bank-supported KALAHI-CIDSS Project in the Philippines.

                         The project implementation- Although overall CDF project implementation has come to an end without major implementation problems the following challenges faced by the project
                         during its implementation are worth to note: (a) delays in transfer of counterpart fund from government to the project- although the CDF project received the best support from
                         Government of Sudan, compared to any other Government co-financed projects, delays of counterpart fund release from MoF has been a recurring problem and sometimes slowed
                         down the implementation pace of the project; and (b) difficult and lengthy procurement process- particularly CDF faced difficulties in completing International Competitive Bidding
                         processes in time. One ICB procurement for solar energy component failed after two years of procurement process mainly due to the international embargo on Sudan and limited
                         capacity of local contractors.

                         The CDF project has gone through two additional financing and three extension of closing date during its entire seven years of implementation. The main reason for the additional
