                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation progress of CDF project is satisfactory. The project has already achieved a third of the key performance indicators and it is likely to achieve the remaining
                         indicators by the end of the project implementation period. To date, the number of projects approved by the CDF has reached a total of 1012 subprojects of which 915 are completed
                         and started providing services to over two million people. Currently 97 subprojects are under different stages of implementation progress and are expected to be completed by the
                         end of December 2012. The completed subprojects have improved access and quality of basic services for over two million people.

                         Improvement in the structure and physical attributes of 541 primary schools and 212 teachers’ houses has provided access to better quality education facilities for 164,128 children

                         40 staff houses built by CDF support are providing health services to 556,978 people (294,880 female and 262,099 male). Some of CDF financed health facilities are equipped with,
                         solar refrigerators, water supply and solar panels. The solar panels contributed to the availability of health services at night, refrigerated storage facilities for drugs and vaccines, and
                         solar lanterns for midwives in order to facilitate service delivery at night. CDF has also financed the training of 273 midwives; the trainees were selected from the villages where CDF

                         subprojects are providing clean water to 542,746 people (265,047 male and 277,699 female), with easy access to the village, which in turn reduced the burden on women and girls
                         traveling long distances to fetch water.
