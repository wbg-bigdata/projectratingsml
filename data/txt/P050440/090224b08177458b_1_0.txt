                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although IDA disbursements has gone up to 50%, project implementation has slowed down with delayed procurement for critical activities posing a big challenge. Government
                         initially made significant progress on the two flagship activities – the Integrated Payroll and Personnel System (IPPS) and design review and construction of the national records
                         center and archives (NRCA )- under component one, these have slowed down. Following the launch of phase one of the IPPS in 11 pilot sites, and issuance of operational
                         acceptance certificate in June 2011, a number of implementation challenges were identified in December 2011 and June 2012. These are yet to be resolved and have led to
                         ineffective use of the IPPS for payroll management and a failure to roll out other modules of the system to ensure that Government gets value for money.

                         Progresses on the roll out of the ROM/OOB framework and implementation of performance contracts across the entire Government is progressing well. However the development of
                         client charters to ensure enhanced citizen voices in monitoring service delivery has slowed down due to the lengthy consultative processes. The reviews and restructuring of
                         Government Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) was concluded but the final report to confirm the fiscal savings and implementation efficiency gains envisaged from this

                         activity is yet to be finalized, approved by cabinet and implemented.

                         Implementation of activities under Component Two continues to be stepped up with the designs for the refurbishment of the proposed Civil Service College premises expected by
                         October 30th 2012. Training under the targeted capacity building and learning and applied change management commenced and over 300 civil servants have been trained.

                         Financial management challenges were resolved with the recruitment and training of a project accountant and FMR are now received with minimal delays. Financial records are now
                         in order. Disbursement to date stand at US Dollars 10.52 million of UPSPEP funding for both component 1 and 2, and the entire US Dollars 20.7 million from component 1 basket
                         fund partners. IDA disbursement rate stands at 50%.

                         Risk factors:

                         1. The slow and ineffective implementation of the IPPS poses challenges on achieving the objective of installing this system. This is one of the key activities under the project
                         supporting the Government's pay reform agenda (effective management of the payroll and wage bill). Further, design review for the National Records Center and Archives (NRCA)
                         has delayed and procurement of a the contractor will only be completed in January 2013. Given the project closing date in eight months, completion of these activities will be a
                         challenge. These two critical activities also face a funding gap approximately US $ 26 million to complete. The Ministry had initially submitted a formal request for (a) the extra
                         funding to the MoFPED to cover IPPS roll out phases III-V, the second phase of construction of the records and archives building and some critical aspects of the Public Service
                         Reform agenda and (b) seeking to extend the project closing date to June 2015 from the current June 2013. However, MoFPED has now submitted a no cost extension of the project
                         to June 2015.

                         2. Government decision to prioritize the payroll module of the IPPS has led to major delays in operationalizing the remaining 7 modules and this poses a serious risk to the
                         Government of not getting full value for money of the entire system as purchased.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The effective roll out of IPPS in all 11 sites under phase 1 needs to be stepped up to ensure that the system achieves its intended objective of enhancing integrity of payroll and
                         improving wage bill management. The 11 institutions include Ministries of Public Service, Education, Health, Finance Planning and Economic Development, the Judiciary and Jinja
                         and Lira District Local Governments and the Health, Education, Judicial and the Public Service Commissions.

                         2. Strengthen Project Management and agree with JVT and Coseke firms on key actions to be completed in the next 3 months to ensure the EDMS is fully functioning and Accounting
                         officers' review of payroll process is resolved.

                         There is need for Government to step up project management and speed up implementation of key activities like the roll out of the payroll management system to justify extension of
                         the closing date and achieve project development objective.
