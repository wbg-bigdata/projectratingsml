                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to improve. The Government has made significant progress on the two flagship activities – the Integrated Payroll and Personnel System (IPPS) and
                         design review and construction of the national records center and archives (NRCA )- under component one and other key elements linked to the JBSF. Following the launch of phase
                         one of the IPPS in 11 pilot sites, operational acceptance certificate was issued on June 2011, and training of staff to support phase two roll out is under way. All MDAs are now using
                         the ROM/OOB framework for planning and budgeting purposes and the Government has now put in place processes to facilitate integrated performance management, starting from

                         charters to ensure clients voice in monitoring service delivery. Completion of Phase one of the reviews and restructuring of Government MDAs is planned for end June 2011, but is
                         likely to be delayed due to the required consultative process. This included 32 of the 62 institutions to be reviewed. The final product will be a report indicating efficiency gains to
                         arise from implementing the review and restructuring recommendations. Implementation of activities under Component Two has also been stepped up with the biggest hurdle of

                         identifying a site for the proposed Civil Service College now overcome, and procurement of a consultant to current out design review for the refurbishment of the facilities now
                         underway.
                         The project is experiencing financial management challenges to records management with no recent bank reconciliations prepared and delayed financial reporting. This is due to
                         recent staff transfers in the accounts department of the implementing agency and a thirty day remedial plan has been drawn up including securing of external support. Disbursement
                         to date stand at US Dollars 8.2 million of UPSPEP funding for both component 1 and 2, and the entire US Dollars 20.7 million from component 1 basket fund partners. Total
                         disbursement therefore stands at US Dollars 28.9 million representing a 66% disbursement rate for the project.

                         Risk factors:
                         1. Sustainability of the IPPS implementation, the NRCA construction and other strategic interventions under the PSRP and its successor programs face challenges of limited funding.
                         The IPPS faces a funding gap of US $ 16.5 million to complete the implementation of the System in all Government agencies and local governments - i.e phases 3-5; the
                         construction and operationalization of the the National Records Center and Archives (NRCA) also faces funding gap of US $ 9. 5 million. The Ministry has submitted a formal request
                         for the US $ 35 million to the MoFPED to cover IPPS roll out phases III-V, the second phase of construction of the records and archives building and some critical aspects of the
                         Public Service Reform agenda and seeking to extend the project closing date to June 2015 from the current June 2013. This is yet to be discussed at the CMU level.
