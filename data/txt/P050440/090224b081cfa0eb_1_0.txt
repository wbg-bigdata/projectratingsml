                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, implementation progress has improved on selected activities with the Ministry now disbursing only 49.73% of project funding and 100% of the basket funds under Component
                         1. The slow disbursement of IDA funds can be partly explained by procurement delays for a selection of key high value activities and as mentioned in previous ISRs, the front loading
                         of resources by the basket fund partners during financial year 2009/2010. During this review period, the Ministry of Public Service (MoPS) has accomplished at least 75% of the
                         agreed key actions including completion of procurement, signing and commencement of contract for the construction of the for the national records center and archives (NRCA), and
                         conclusion of bid evaluation process for the Civil Service college refurbishment. The Government has achieved 90% payroll data migration on to the integrated payroll and personnel

                         system (IPPS). However some delays have been noted in the roll out and implementation of all modules under the IPPS leading to ineffective use of the IPPS for payroll
                         management. This will have to be addressed to ensure that Government gets value for money. A number of key milestones and time lines have been agreed upon with Government
                         during the last ISM to be monitored every three months to confirm that all activities would be completed in the proposed new closing date of June 30, 2015.

                         Not withstanding the above challenges, the Bank has over the last 6 months noted enhanced efforts at project implementation and attributes this to the new leadership in the Ministry
                         of Public Service (the implementing agency) and inclusion of the IPPS as one of the key result areas under the Government's high level matrix on restoring good governance and
                         fighting corruption. Agreed disbursement projection for this financial year has been met.

                         Progresses on the roll out of the results oriented management and output based budgeting (ROM/OOB) framework and implementation of performance contracts across the entire
                         Government is progressing well and development of client charters to ensure enhanced citizen voices in monitoring service delivery has been accomplished in 15 local governments,
                         3 regional referral hospitals and 4 Ministries. Selected actions from the review and restructuring of Government Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) were approved by
                         cabinet and implemented.

                         Implementation of activities under Component Two continues to be stepped up. Designs for the refurbishment of the proposed Civil Service College premises and bid evaluation
                         process to secure contractor were finalized. Training under the targeted capacity building and learning and applied change management commenced and over 1000 civil servants
                         have been trained. A total of 488 senior managers have benefited from training by the college under the caravan approach and the Ministry of Public Service launched the Masters in
                         Business Administration program as part of proffesionalization of senior management in the public service.

                         Risk factors:

                         1. The slow and ineffective implementation of the IPPS continues to pose challenges on achieving the objectives of installing this system. This is one of the key activities under the
                         project supporting the Government's pay reform agenda (effective management of the payroll and wage bill) and the Government high level matrix on improving management of
                         public resources. The Government has sought a no cost extension of the closing date from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2015 to provide time for completion of the roll out and
                         implementation of the IPPS, construction of the national records center and archives and refurbishment of the premises for the Civil Service College. Further, the Government has
                         sought extra project management support for the IPPS.
