3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

        Background

Following considerable economic deterioration immediately after independence (1991-93), the
Armenian economy has enjoyed a strong and sustained recovery, with real GDP growth averaging
5.5 percent during 1994-2002. Successful efforts in macroeconomic stabilization, combined with
structural reforms, especially in establishing the legal framework for private sector development,
particularly in the energy and banking sectors, and enterprise restructuring contributed to
economic growth. A well-educated workforce with specialized technical skills was also key to
the economic growth. The rapid and sustained output growth, with low inflation, has lowered
poverty. The share of population living in poverty decreased from 55 percent in 1998/99 to 48
percent in 2001 and the share of population in extreme poverty declined from 27 percent to 20
percent in the same period. The strong economic performance was sustained despite several
shocks, including: the 1988 earthquake; the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict; the 1998 Russian
financial crisis; the 1999 assassination of the Prime Minister, key Government officials and some
members of Parliament; and the severe drought of 2000.

Sustaining economic growth and expanding its benefits is a major challenge for Armenia. The
report Growth Challenges and Government Policy in Armenia cited several constraints to
achieving sustainable growth: (i) insufficient improvements in the business environment, including
the slow pace of deregulation and lack of enforcement of the legal framework; (ii) inadequate
access of new entrepreneurs to underutilized assets: (iii) insufficient supply of management skills;
(iv) too large a public sector; and (v) other constraints such as borders closed to trade because of
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the high cost of borrowing and the concern over the stability of
the fiscal situation. To combat some of these disadvantages, the Government of Armenia (GOA)
changed the direction of reform program in early 2001, and launched a program to improve the
business environment, develop consultation mechanisms with the private sector and build capacity
for export and investment promotion. The World Bank's Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC4) and the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) supported this program.
The Government effort in these areas has been broadly successful.

SAC4 in the amount of US$50 million equivalent (SDR38.4 million) was the fifth of six
adjustment credits of IDA support to the Government of Armenia's economic reform program
(one Rehabilitation Credit and three structural adjustment credits preceded SAC4). SAC4 was a
two-tranche operation with an additional floating tranche. It was approved by the Board on May
22, 2001, and became effective on June 12, 2001. The strategy behind a floating tranche was to
allow flexibility in completing an important agenda item carried over from SAC3, specifically the
privatization of the EDC at the most appropriate time during the operation. The floating tranche
was an appropriate approach as evidenced by the successful privatization. The floating tranche
was also the largest of the three tranches, US$20 million compared with US$15 million each for
the other two, reflecting the importance to the economy of this privatization. Overall, therefore,
the SAC4 was an appropriately designed program and responsive to Armenia's needs.

        Objective

The original objectives of Armenia's SAC4, as reflected in the Report and Recommendation of
the President of the International Development Association, dated April 26, 2001, were to
support the Government's efforts to facilitate private sector development and job creation, and
included strengthening the public institutions capable of sustaining an investment-friendly business
environment, and advancing several reforms in social protection, health, and education. SAC4
objectives were appropriate to the priority needs in Armenia and supported a broadening and
deepening of the reforms originating under SAC3, and focused on private sector development
(PSD).    SAC4's quick disbursing nature helped ease Armenia's balance of payments and
budgetary needs. SAC4's objectives were consistent with the program expressed in the Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) that was presented to the Boards of the IDA and the
IMF in March 2001 and May 2001 respectively.

3.2 Revised Objective:

No revisions.

3.3 Original Components:

The components of SAC4 were consistent with the main goals of the IPRSP and the Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2002-2004, which was discussed by the
Executive Directors simultaneously with SAC4.           The CAS has focused on reforms and
investments in the three key areas of IPRSP: (i) improving the business environment by reducing
administrative barriers to investment and new entry; (ii) strengthening public sector management
and reducing corruption, and (iii) rebuilding human and physical capital by promoting better
financing of education and primary health, maintaining infrastructure, and targeting of social
protection expenditures.     The components of SAC4 that correspond with these program
directions were:

1. Maintaining suitable macroeconomic framework;
2. Improving the business climate, facilitating enterprise restructuring and strategic privatization;
    and
3. Improving efficiency in service delivery and strengthening equity of access.

Each component is a key to a reform program that aims at increasing opportunities for the broad
citizenry and at reducing poverty.      The component on improving the business climate was
designed to reduce the interference of government officials in business activities, and improving
the regulatory environment.      Enterprise restructuring and strategic privatization aimed at
improving the fiscal situation and prospects for growth. Social sector reform was geared to
improving service delivery, which was essential to the goals of poverty reduction and skills
development.

3.4 Revised Components:

No revisions.

3.5 Quality at Entry:


ICR ­ Satisfactory. SAC4 differed from its predecessors, SAC3 and SAC2, which largely
focused on a macro agenda. The policy priorities shifted under SAC4 toward improving the
business environment by aiming at a long list of problems such as registering and licensing and
other steps that increase the cost of doing business. SAC4 incorporated three main lessons from
earlier adjustment operations: (i) limited implementation capacity dictates that the program must
be focused; (ii) strong coordination with the IMF is essential; and (iii) TA is necessary to assist
the country in accelerating reforms at the micro level. In reality, the SAC4-supported program
was relatively broad with 25 tranche conditions covering actions as diverse as a new land code
and privatizing the Armenian Saving Bank, pension reform and a Heating Strategy. These actions
were nevertheless selective and represented high impact measures. The broadness of the program
did not require any waivers of tranche conditions. There was very close cooperation with the
IMF and the IMF program remained broadly on track. The SATAC2 provided critical technical
assistance in all areas of the reform program and was especially useful in cases where the GOA
could not secure grant funding.

SAC4 document cited several risks. Policy reversal risk was viewed as small, but the potential for
social dissatisfaction with income recovery could have threatened political stability.                        The
mitigation of these risks was successful in retrospect as growth-oriented reforms accelerated while



                                                     - 6 -

increasing attention was devoted to social protection and services. The government ownership
was uneven across ministries, but the economy showed strong resilience to external shocks such
as drought and high import prices such as oil.

QAG ­ Satisfactory. The QAG concluded that SAC4's conception and approach were strong.
The focus of SAC4 on micro level issues, getting incentives right and improving the overall
environment for private investment was considered by QAG to be in line with Armenia's
priorities. QAG also maintained that SAC4 supported and directed the authorities' attention to
medium term social issues as well, especially on education, health and social safety nets. The
report indicated that a major strength of SAC4 was the thorough diagnostic work that was
undertaken to underpin the credit. Monitoring measures were judged adequate to facilitate the
review progress. The early design and use of household surveys and beneficiary assessments were
good practices that strengthened the operation. The Business surveys, which were part of the
diagnostic work for the PSD element, were continued under SAC4.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:


The achievement of objectives is rated satisfactory. The top achievements of SAC4 in terms of
development impact were in the areas of macroeconomic stability driven by private sector and
exports and improvement of the broad business climate by streamlining the business/government
interfaces, the delivery of social services including improved targeting of the poverty benefit, and
the privatization of the electricity distribution companies (EDC).           These outcomes are
summarized in Table 1.       The signs are positive that the outcomes of SAC4 will be highly
satisfactory. However, there is not sufficient evidence at this point to positively draw that
conclusion. SAC4 dealt with long-term issues that would threaten growth by keeping the cost of
doing business high. At the same time, there was an opportunity to follow through with high
impact measures in health and education and improve social protection as highlighted in the
IPRSP. The main short-run impact of the EDC privatization was the fiscal improvement of
eliminating a loss-making enterprise from the public accounts and gaining revenue from the sale.
The longer-run expected outcome will be higher operating efficiency, improved investment
mobilization and benefits to upstream activities like generation, which will recover more costs
because a privatized EDC has greater incentives to achieve higher collections.

Surveys of Armenian enterprises have shown that implementation of the structural reforms have
been successful in strengthening the environment for private sector operation, job creation and
export promotion. The 2002 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS),
conducted jointly by the EBRD and the World Bank, concluded that there was a considerable
decline in both the frequency of corruption and average time spent by enterprises on dealing with
public officials. The Government consultation mechanisms with the private sector have also been
strengthened and the performance of the recently established Business Council, where
representatives from private and public sectors and members of the National Assembly interact
and consult with one another, has been satisfactory. This Council has promoted a transparent and
open dialogue between the Government and the private sector and has strengthened public-private
partnerships in Armenia.

The macroeconomic response to SAC4 and other financing and policy measures is reflected in
Table 2. Economic growth increased from 6.0 percent in 2000 to 9.6 percent in 2001 and to 12.9
percent in 2002. The strong economic growth of 2001-02 was, for the first time, driven by a high
rate of export expansion. Manufacturing exports grew by more than 50 percent in two years,
with a positive impact on employment and household incomes. The economy continued its strong
performance during the first half of 2003. In this period, real GDP increased by 14.8 percent
mainly due to donor-financed construction activity and processing of metals and precious stones.
During this period, inflation remained at a low level of 3.5 percent.

SAC4 had an important impact on improving the quality of growth patterns. In addition to an
even higher average growth rate of over 8 percent during 2000-02, macroeconomic stability,
external debt and poverty improved. The factors responsible for this improvement include:

l Reductions in administrative pressures on the private sector, better communication between
    the government and private sector and greater government capacity for investment and export
    promotion;
l Better political relations with the Diaspora (Armenians living outside the country) that was
    reflected in higher inflows of investments in and contributions to the country; and
l Increased inflow of private transfers, which was a turnaround of the situation following the
    1998 Russian crisis.

Exports doubled in three years as shown in Table 2. More than half of industrial growth was
based in food processing, jewelry, and diamond polishing, relatively labor intensive activities.
There has been a continued increase in the number of registered businesses, particularly joint
ventures, as well as FDI, which increased by more than half since 2000. The number of registered
taxpayers has also increased by 19 percent since 2000, which has led to some stabilization of the
overall tax performance. Armenia also continued its free trade policies and laid groundwork for
World Trade Organization (WTO) membership. These measures led to Armenia's membership in
the WTO in February 2003.

Supervision missions consistently rated implementation and achievement of project development
objectives ratings satisfactory. In addition, all components of SAC4 were rated satisfactory for
every PSR. It might be argued that the PSR ratings for June 2002 and December 2002 could
have included an unsatisfactory rating for implementation because of difficulties in meeting the
condition of the floating tranche. The World Bank supported the GOA on preparation of the
EDC for privatization under SAC3 and SAC4 since 1998. However, two attempts to privatize
the EDC via a strategic private investor during 2001 failed because of lack of investor interest
resulting from deteriorating global markets in 2001. The GOA had carried out all the necessary
steps in the first half of 2002 to solicit bids; there were simply none forthcoming. In the second
half of the year, the Bank and the Government had planned to restructure the credit to modify the
condition of the floating tranche by replacing privatization with a management contract.
Ultimately, a bidder came forth, bought shares and contracted operations to an experienced
management team. The floating tranche condition was met, though with a one-year delay (Table
3), and the credit was fully disbursed.

4.2 Outputs by components:


Improvement of the Business Climate

Satisfactory.     The major outputs in improving the business climate included a new legal
framework that removed enforcement barriers in such areas as foreclosure and collateral disputes.
SAC4 also supported improved bankruptcy procedures and an amended Law on Joint Stock
Companies. SAC4 reforms dealt with a number of business nuisances by streamlining inspections
and licensing procedures and making them more transparent. The SAC4 conditions provided for
the establishment of the Business Council where business interests could present to the
Government their problems with administrative procedures.            Tax and customs were also
reorganized and reformed to simplify processes and to meet WTO standards.

Facilitating Enterprise Restructuring

Satisfactory.    Although not a core condition, the reform program included privatizing all
remaining enterprises appropriate for private ownership. To facilitate privatization, liquidation
procedures, transferring assets to communities of liquidated companies and debt resolution issues
were simplified. In addition, the GOA agreed to privatize at least 100 medium enterprises per
year during 2001-03 and to submit to Parliament a Law on Privatization of Municipal Property.



                                                  - 9 -

SAC4 supported a key land reform measure to transfer ownership to enterprises of land that they
occupy. The Government completed privatization of most of the small and medium enterprises
and 75 percent of the large enterprises by the end of 2002. SAC4 supported a wide range of
measures in improving the regulatory framework for infrastructure, particularly for the power
sector. The measures were aimed at strengthening the role and independence of the Energy
Regulatory Commission (ERC), establishing a competitive market for electricity and developing a
strategy for improving efficiency in the non-privatized parts of the power sector. These measures
laid the groundwork for the strategic privatization of the EDC.         The GOA exceeded the
conditions required for the energy legal framework by drafting a completely new law that
eliminated government interference in EDC operations.

Strategic Privatization

Satisfactory. The key privatization was supported by the third or "floating" tranche, which called
for the privatization of Armenia's Electricity Distribution Companies (EDC). This proved to be a
challenging condition to fulfill, which required one extension and had three failed attempts. The
World Bank had supported the Government in preparation for privatization of the EDC since
1998, and this action was an important component of SAC3 supported reforms. With continuous
support from the privatization experts, including from the International Finance Corporation's
Corporate Finance Services (CFS) Group, which the Government engaged in mid-2001 with
USAID funding, the Government made considerable effort to fulfill this condition. A high level
committee chaired by the Prime Minister was established to lead the privatization effort. The
Government introduced amendments to the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate EDC
privatization, commercial operations of the energy sector, and enhance regulation. The public
awareness campaign to inform the public of the need for, and the benefits of, the privatization of
the EDC was effective.

Because of the lack of investor interest due to the downturn in global capital markets in 2001, the
Government and the Bank had agreed to settle for placing the EDC under a management contract
arrangement to improve the management quality and accountability of the EDC. In early 2002,
the support from the IFC was redirected to finding a qualified management firm under suitable
terms and conditions and in a transparent way. While the search for a management contractor
was under way, the Government received expressions of interest from two potential investors in
negotiating a privatization arrangement. Taking into account the substantial investment needs of
the EDC and the fact that with private management contractor, the political influence over the
sector would remain considerable under state ownership, the Government had a clear preference
for attracting both an investor and management expertise to the sector.         In July 2002, the
Government formally invited both investors who had expressed interest as well as those investors
who were interested in 2001 to participate in a revised tender. The Midland Resource Holdings
(MRH) responded positively to the invitation to bid and its financial offer was consistent with
what strategic investors had informally indicated in 2001. The Share Purchase Agreement for the
EDC was signed in August 2002. An assessment of this transaction by the World Bank and other
donors determined that the contract conditions effectively protected the Government and
consumers from poor performance of the privatized EDC. During the first few months of its
operations, the company has managed to improve its financial and technical performance



                                               - 10 -

significantly. The policy dialogue and Bank advice in supporting the License Agreement and
settlement/clearing account arrangements for the EDCs was very strong. This policy dialogue and
advice were crucial in persuading the Bank senior management that the transaction would be
sound and in assuaging concerns about potential risk and Bank reputation.

As a condition of the SPA and in order to overcome its lack of operational experience in the
energy sector, at the end of 2002, the MRH invited and entered into a management contract with
the Daewoo Engineering, to improve its technical and commercial performance. The Daewoo's
management contract services have been followed and remained sustainable under technical,
advisory and management services provided by PA Consulting, a USAID contractor.

The restructuring of the Armenian Saving Bank was supported under SAC3 and its privatization
was completed as a second tranche condition of SAC4. The private owners of the bank tripled its
size and the bank now operates the largest branch network in the country (99 branches). The
Armenian Saving Bank has the largest customer base in the country and the new management is
supervising its rapid expansion.

Social Sector Reform

        Improve Efficiency in Social Service Delivery

Satisfactory. The old system of health care delivery was too expensive and inefficient, owing in
large part to over-capacity inherited from the Soviet times, and so SAC4 sought to initiate
restructuring of the sector and bring health care delivery more in line with economic principles.
SAC4 supported contracting arrangements to introduce global budgeting on the total services
provided, called for reductions in over-capacity in hospitals and for bringing the basic benefits
package that is available for free to several eligible groups in line with budget constraints. In
addition, hospitals were no longer funded on the basis of the number of beds, but on the basis of
people served. The Government increased the budget for public health in real terms, partially paid
arrears of previous years, and increased the overall health budget by 55 percent during
1997-2002.

Highly Satisfactory. In education, the key reform was the conversion of groups of public
schools to a new financial system that left greater flexibility with individual school administration.
School budgets are now determined by the number of students, not the number of classes as
before.   This practice had led to an oversupply of teachers, again a case of over-capacity
characteristic of the Soviet system. Under the new financial system, if schools save funds in one
area of their budgets they can use it for another. Under the previous system, schools had to spend
the entire amount under the line item or lose the funds. Because of the success of this reform,
GOA has targeted all public schools for conversion by 2005. Thus far, 1,440 out of about 2,000
schools have been brought under the new system. The student teacher ratio has been increased to
10:1 currently, with a goal of 15:1 over five years. Budget outlays for education increased by 90
percent during 1997-2002.




                                                - 11 -

        Strengthen Equity of Access to Economic Benefits

SAC4 supported a number of measures aimed at improving the targeting of social assistance.
These measures included beneficiary assessments and re-registration, a database for applicants for
assistance, ensuring that social benefits offered were fiscally sustainable and a review of labor
regulations. The single-family benefit is now better targeted, because it is based on an improved
understanding of need. The GOA also completed the first phase of pension reform that included
submission to Parliament of a New Law on State Pensions.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

Not applicable.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:


Substantial. Measures to improve the legal framework for, and enforcement of bankruptcy,
dispute resolution, and licensing, state inspections transparency, establishment of the Business
Council, reforms of taxes and customs administration, land ownership reform, strengthening of
the ERC and other measures all contribute to institutional development. In fact SAC4 supported
reforms changed the direction of the reform program and the move toward a better operating
environment for business that SAC4 supported, and the commitment shown by the Armenian
authorities suggests a substantial impact. Reforming the financial management of schools was a
major step forward for schools' autonomy and has increased their flexibility and capacity to
deliver better education. In the health sector, the impact may not yet be substantial, but major
changes are underway in rationalizing health service delivery. In social protection, the GOA is
recognizing the important role of poverty benefits and pensions during a time when the benefits of
growth have not been widely distributed amongst the population. The single-family benefit has
become more established and has wide public acceptance, despite being scaled back.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Armenia faced negative external factors during SAC4 implementation due to drought in 2000,
which reduced agricultural production, and rising oil prices (Armenia is an oil importer).
Armenia, nevertheless, maintained its reform agenda. External factors were also unfavorable in
completing the floating tranche condition of privatizing the EDC. With the collapse of global
energy service companies, investor interest in Armenian electric distribution was low and bidders
could not be found on the second attempt to privatize. Eventually, a single bidder was found
during the one-year extension of project close.




                                                     - 12 -

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Government efforts to deal with negative factors in the SAC4-supported program were generally
good (see section 7.5), though there was an occasional snag. For example, the first attempt to
privatize the EDC failed because of insufficient policy change in the energy sector to interest
investors. In a way, this worked in Armenia's favor because, had the EDC been sold and the
buyer gone bankrupt during the corporate crisis, the privatization would have been a failure.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

There were a couple of factors, probably related to concern over the impact of reforms that, to
some extent, impeded implementation. These could be seen at the Ministry of Health with
concern over what health sector restructuring would entail (i.e., downsizing). Another example is
that the Ministry of Energy's technical role in sector reforms was not as supportive as it could
have been during the first attempt to privatize the EDC. The Government helped minimize these
factors by improving support to and coordination among ministries.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The total original credit amount was SDR38.4 million (US$50 million equivalent). The entire
credit amount was disbursed in two tranches and a floating tranche. The credit was made on
standard IDA terms with a term of 40 years, a 10-year grace period, and an IDA service charge of
75 basis points on the undisbursed balance. The borrower was the Republic of Armenia. In June
2001, the Government of the Netherlands co-financed SAC4 with a grant for 10 million Dutch
Guilders (US3.8 million equivalent).

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:


The sustainability of the SAC4 is rated highly likely. The GOA satisfactorily completed all
tranche conditions and continued its reform program through the preparation of a follow-on
SAC5, which was approved by the Board on March 13, 2003. Many of the reforms are also
difficult to reverse, such as the privatizations and transfer of land ownership. The threat to
sustainability occurs when vested interests find ways to circumvent the reforms. This is the main
reason that Armenia finds itself in the paradoxical situation as one of the top reformers in the
former Soviet Union (FSU), yet still needs further improvements to the business climate. The
combined weight of the reform champions at the top and the momentum of reform are expected
to overcome traditional vested interests.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

The types of objectives supported by the SAC4, such as those promoting the business
environment and restructuring social service delivery are medium term in nature and will require
more time to be fully effective. They are expected to be sustained as a new way of doing business
to which GOA has demonstrated its commitment. The GOA is bringing social services delivery
more in line with economic and fiscal realities and plans further restructuring in the health and

education sectors that will contribute to sustainability. Transparency and accountability in the
accounting field and tax and customs administration are deepening and are contributing to private
sector development. The key to sustainability will be whether the improved business climate leads
to growth that benefits a much broader segment of the population. SAC5 is moving forward on
all of the parts of the SAC4-supported program, which will further enhance sustainability.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:


Satisfactory. The project design was a good response to the need to improve the business
climate and bolster the social sectors. The design was optimistic in gauging how quickly the
program could be implemented, but it was appropriate because it stretched Armenia's capabilities
in key areas of reform. (See Quality at Entry section).

7.2 Supervision:


Satisfactory. The task team petitioned for an extension, which was granted for one year during
which time the floating tranche was satisfied. It was particularly important to carry out this
condition (to privatize the EDC) because it had been carried over from the previous adjustment
operation (SAC3). As in previous operations, the Bank and the Borrower made excellent use of
supporting TA, particularly SATAC2, through which many of the reform measures were
formulated and implemented (see ICR for SATAC2).             Close coordination of the technical
assistance from bilateral and multilateral provided a critical mass of high-quality expertise. The
Bank energy team worked effectively with the IFC to ensure a successful privatization of the
EDCs.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:


Satisfactory. The Bank performed well and supported a meaningful program in a wide variety of
components.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:


Satisfactory. The GOA was fully supportive of the reform program at the highest levels. The
Borrower worked well with the Bank in identifying measures in a wide range of areas that would
have substantial impact in improving the business climate and in social service delivery.

7.5 Government implementation performance:


Satisfactory. The GOA met all conditions for the release of all tranches. Government ownership
was good, as in previous operations, and the Government improved cross-ministerial coordination
of the program, which helped achieve the main reform targets on time. At times the GOA went
beyond core conditions to implement a broader reform program.              However, the non-core
conditions were not pursued with the same intensity, as were the core conditions.



                                               - 14 -

7.6 Implementing Agency:


Satisfactory. IAs' support for reforms was uneven, but there was some understandable anxiety
among certain IAs that faced reforms. The Ministry of Energy, it was reported, did show some
reluctance in its technical support to the privatization process for the EDC. There was similar
concern in the Ministry of Health with regard to hospital rationalization and potential
retrenchment. However, these agencies were cooperative ultimately. The Ministries of Justice
(MOJ), Social Protection, and the Armenian Development Agency implemented very well. The
Ministry of Justice did a particularly good job in its role in reforming the legal framework for
business and infrastructure. Other IAs performed satisfactorily as well and made good use of the
TA support in developing the capacity to implement reforms.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:


Satisfactory.     Except for the few areas cited that can be improved in the next operation,
Borrower performance on the whole was strong.

8. Lessons Learned


It is very helpful to social sector proponents when the Bank negotiates for higher budget allocations
to social sectors. In interviews with nationals, they report that the structural adjustment operations are
influential in gaining higher allocations and preventing under-funding of social sectors.       SAC5 has
incorporated this lesson in its design by obtaining agreement to increase the health and education budgets
by 27.0 and 14.4 percent from 2002 to 2003, respectively.

Strong TA resources are essential for successful reform program implementation, particularly during
the second, more detailed phase of reforms. It has been a matter of practice for Bank TA credits to
support Armenian adjustment operations.          Without the accompanying SATAC2, the design and
implementation of SAC4 would have been much less geared to national priorities and fewer of the high
impact measures would have been identified. In fact, the SATAC2 was restructured specifically to support
the new program focus on improved business climate supported by SAC4.              Bilateral TA was also
important in a number of areas including privatization of the EDC, legal drafting, and preparation of
pension reform.

For future privatizations, the Bank could be more flexible and innovative. At times it is very
difficult to find investors to buy utilities, such as at the time of the SAC4, and putting them up for
sale can be risky. Under these circumstances, the Bank should explore new ways of combining
the financing and expertise required to privatize. As long as the ultimate objective to transfer
ownership of the utility and improve efficiency is achieved, it should not matter that the
privatization was not carried out in a conventional way under ideal conditions with a well-funded,
high expertise strategic investor.

                                   REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA
                          STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT IV

The forth consecutive Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC IV), provided to Armenia by the IDA
somewhat differed from its predecessors, SAC III, SAC II and SAC I and aimed to improve the
business environment in Armenia. The credit represented a significant source of budget deficit
financing, and was crucial in terms of development impact directed to the improvement of the
broad business climate, the delivery of social services and the privatization of the electricity
distribution companies (EDC). Taking into consideration Armenia's limited access to alternative
sources of budget support SAC IV was of crucial importance to avoid additional contraction of
the level of public expenditures in the socially sensitive areas.

The Government of Armenia holds the view that SAC IV along with SAC III was successful in
extending the necessary support for the second-generation reforms, aimed to capitalize on the
positive effects and strengthen the foundations of first generation stabilization reform package,
undertaken with support of SAC I and SAC II. Those reforms were mainly targeted at: (i)
strengthening public sector management and financial discipline through improving budget
management, accounting and financial information systems; implementing financial rehabilitation,
carrying out tariff reforms and improving institutional capacity in such sectors as energy and
irrigation; (ii) accelerating private sector development through banking sector reform,
privatization and liquidation; (iii) ensuring social sustainability of the reform process through
reforming the pension system, restructuring and increasing public spending shares on education
and health.

Previous reforms achievements supported by SAC I SAC II- stable macroeconomic environment
with very low inflation and stable exchange rate, appropriate and consolidated monetary policy
and by SAC III- deepening the structural reforms especially in enterprise restructuring and
privatization-were critical for successful accomplishment of SAC IV.

In the government's opinion, the project supported by SAC IV was especially successful in the
following directions:

l Improvement of the business climate: reducing the interference of government officials in
    business activities and improving the regulatory environment.
l Private sector development: enterprise restructuring and strategic privatization aimed at
    improving fiscal situation and prospects for growth.
l Social sector: improving service delivery, which was essential to the reform goals of poverty
    reduction and skills development.

At the same time, the Government realizes that further success and sustainability in reform
process is dependent on continuous capacity building in governmental structures and
consolidation on the political area. Armenia faced negative external factors during SAC IV
implementation due to drought in 2000, which reduced the agricultural production, and rising oil
prices, which impacted the economy because Armenia is an oil importer. External factors were
also unfavorable in completing the floating tranche condition of privatizing the electric distribution
companies. Government efforts to deal with negative factors in the SAC IV-supported program
was generally good, though there was an occasional snag: the first attempt to privatize the EDC
failed because of insufficient policy change in the energy sector to interest investors. In a way, this
worked in Armenia's favor because, had the EDC been sold and the buyer gone bankrupt during
the corporate crisis, the privatization would have been a failure.

The Government appreciates the amount of flexibility and understanding displayed by the Bank in
the light of factors outside the Government's control that hampered proper implementation of
specific elements of the SAC IV program. The current Government reform program provides for
further deepening of structural reform agenda, some components of which are supported by the
follow-up IDA credits SAC V.
